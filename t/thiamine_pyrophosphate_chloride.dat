In addition, the <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> uptake of the <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> auxotroph was inhibited by either thiamine or thiamine monophosphate. Although the <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> uptake of a revertant, selected for prototrophy from the thiamine monophosphate auxotroph, was inhibited by thiamine to an extent comparable to that observed with the thiamine monophosphate auxotroph, its growth was no longer inhibited by thiamine.

40|$|We {{purified}} branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase to {{a specific}} activity of 10 mumol/min per mg of protein from Pseudomonas putida grown on valine. The purified enzyme was active with 2 -ketoisovalerate, 2 -ketoisocaproate, and 2 -keto- 3 -methylvalerate in a ratio of 1. 0 : 0. 8 : 0. 7 but showed no activity with either pyruvate or 2 -ketoglutarate. There were four polypeptides in the purified enzyme (molecular weights, 49, 000, 46, 000, 39, 000, and 37, 000). The purified enzyme was deficient in the specific lipoamide dehydrogenase produced during growth on valine (molecular weight, 49, 000). Branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase required L-valine, oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, coenzyme A, <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> and magnesium <b>chloride.</b> A partially purified preparation catalyzed the oxidation of 2 -keto-[1 - 14 C]isovalerate to [14 C]carbon dioxide, isobutyryl-coenzyme A, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in equimolar amounts. Both the Km and the Vmax for 2 -ketoisovalerate were affected {{by the addition of}} L-valine to the assay mixture. However, only the Vmax values for oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and coenzyme A were affected when L-valine was present.

40|$|Two {{types of}} mutants of Escherichia coli were isolated, {{one of which}} (mutant 70 - 23 - 107) responded to <b>{{thiamine}}</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> and the other (mutant 70 - 23 - 102) to thiamine monophosphate and <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate.</b> They were produced by further mutation of a thiamine auxotroph of E. coli 70 - 23 with N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. The parent organism required thiamine because phosphohydroxymethylpyrimidine kinase activity was lacking in this organism, and hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate was not permeable through the cell membrane of E. coli. Thiamine, thiamine monophosphate, and <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> were all equally active for the parent, whereas mutants 70 - 23 - 102 and 70 - 23 - 107 lost their ability to grow on thiamine. Both mutants differed only in the growth response to thiamine monophosphate: the former could grow on thiamine monophosphate, whereas the latter could not. Experimental results with the newly isolated mutants indicate that in E. coli the free form of thiamine {{is not involved in}} de novo synthesis of <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> but <b>thiamine</b> monophosphate, an exclusive product formed by the reaction between hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate and hydroxyethylthiazole monophosphate, is directly phosphorylated to form <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate.</b> Exogenous <b>thiamine,</b> on the other hand, is converted to <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> via the intermediate formation of thiamine monophosphate...|$|R

A 6 - to 10 -fold increase in growth, as measured turbidimetrically, was observed when Iso VitaleX was added to a basal medium of brain heart infusion broth to a final concentration of 1 % (vol/vol). <b>Thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (cocarboxylase), a constituent component of Iso VitaleX, {{was found to be}} the only growth-promoting factor, and it {{could be used as a}} substitute for Iso VitaleX. An equimolar concentration (2. 2 microM) of thiamine monophosphate promoted growth equal to that of <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate.</b> <b>Thiamine</b> was nonstimulatory for all 10 strains tested.

40|$|SummaryRiboswitches are noncoding mRNA {{elements}} that bind small-molecule metabolites with high affinity and specificity, and they regulate {{the expression of}} associated genes. The thi-box riboswitch can exhibit a 1000 -fold higher affinity for <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> over closely related noncognate compounds such as thiamine monophosphate. To understand the chemical basis of thi-box pyrophosphate specificity, we have determined crystal structures of an E. coli thi-box bound to <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> <b>thiamine</b> monophosphate, and the structural analogs benfotiamine and pyrithiamine. When bound to monophosphorylated compounds, the RNA {{elements that}} recognize the thiamine and phosphate moieties of the ligand move closer together. This allows the riboswitch to recognize the monophosphate {{in a manner similar}} to how it recognizes the β-phosphate of <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate.</b> In the pyrithiamine complex, the pyrophosphate binding site is largely unstructured.

The animals in all groups were sacrificed under anesthesia, and their cochleas were harvested for morphological and biochemical observations. Results. In group 1, receiving only cisplatin, cochlear glutathione concentrations, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities significantly decreased (P< 0. 05) and malondialdehyde concentrations significantly increased (P< 0. 05) compared to the control group. In group 2, receiving <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> and cisplatin, the concentrations of enzymes were near those of the control group.

From clinical evidence these subjects were divided into five groups: (1) necropsy-proved cases of subacute necrotising encephalomyelopathy, (2) cases positive for urinary thiamine pyrophosphate: adenosine triphosphate phosphotransferase inhibitor, (3) clinically likely cases of subacute necrotising encephalomyelopathy (patients still alive, or on whom no necropsy was performed), (4) cases diagnosed as diseases other than subacute necrotising encephalomyelopathy (control group), (5) cases for which no diagnosis had been made. Comparison of erythrocyte transketolase activities with and without added <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> and of the % <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> effect for each group compared with the control group showed no statistically significant differences from normal values for any of these parameters. Similarly, there were no differences between the two sexes in transketolase activity, and no correlation between transketolase activity and age.

Experimental Approach: A total of 48 Albino Wistar male rats were used. Rats were divided into groups as thiamine þ doxorubicin (TIA þ DOX), <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> þ doxorubicin (TPP þ DOX), DOX, and healthy (HEA) groups. One hour after the administration of thiamine and TPP in 25 mg/kg doses, 5 mg/kg doxorubicin were injected to all groups except HEA group during 7 days. Then, the samples were collected for biochemical (glutathione [GSH], malondialdehyde [MDA], DNA damage, creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and troponine I [TP-I]), molecular (TPK), and histopathological examinations. Key Results: Oxidant parameters (MDA and DNA damage) decreased and antioxidant parameter (GSH) increased in TPPþDOX group. In addition, levels of CK, CK-MB, and TP-I were low in the TPPþDOX group and high in the TIAþDOX and DOX groups. Cardiac tissue was protected in TPPþ DOX group, and no protective effect was observed in TIA þ DOX and DOX groups. Messenger RNA expression of TPK was decreased in DOX and TIA þ DOX groups. Conclusion and Implications: The cardiotoxic effect of doxorubicin originated from the inhibition of TPK enzyme resulting in insufficient production of <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate...</b>|$|R

Materials and Methods: Diabetic rats were divided into a control group (IRC) to be exposed to I/R, an ovarian I/R + 2. 2 mg/kg melatonin (IRML) group, an ovarian I/R + famotidine (IRFA) group, an ovarian I/R + 20 mg/kg mirtazapine (IRMR) group, an ovarian I/R + 20 mg/kg <b>thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (IRTP) group, and a sham operation (SO) group. Results: In the control group exposed to I/R, the levels of the oxidant parameters Malondialdehyde (MDA) and Myeloperoxidase(MPO) were significantly higher compared with the SO group, while the levels of the antioxidant parameters glutathione (GSH), Glutathioneperoxidase(GPO), Glutathione reductase (GSHRd), Glutathione S - transferase (GST), and[y 1]   Superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly lower. Melatonin, famotidine, mirtazapine, and thiamin pyrophosphate prevented a rise in oxidant parameters and a decrease in antioxidants in ovarian tissue exposed to I/R. However, apart from thiamin pyrophosphate, none of the drugs were able to prevent infertility caused by I/R injury.   Conclusion: Prevention of ovarian I/R injury-related infertility in rats with induced diabetes is not through antioxidant activity. <b>Thiamine</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> prevents infertility through an as yet unknown mechanism.
