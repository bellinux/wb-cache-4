30|$|The {{oxidative}} {{potential of}} a given amount of seed inoculum (biomass agent) {{as well as the}} reliability of a BOD measuring instrument are checked periodically by monitoring the oxygen uptake data of some pure organic compounds for which BOD is known or determinable. One of the most commonly used such compounds is a mixture of glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6) and glutamic acid (C 5 H 9 NO 4), and a mixture of 150  mg/L of each is recommended in 1  L aqueous solution (APHA 2005). Pure glucose has an exceptionally high oxidation rate with relatively simple seeds. When used with glutamic acid, the oxidation rate is stabilized and {{is similar to that of}} most municipal wastewater (Ramalho 1977). Stoichiometrically, ThOD for 150  mg of Glucose is 160  mg and that for the 150  mg of Glutamic acid is 212.2  mg. Therefore, the <b>theoretical</b> chemical <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> for the prepared GGA solution is 372.2  mg/L. For biodegradation studies, a small volume, vs (ml), of the GGA solution is diluted to a total test volume Vtest (standard volume =  300  ml) of oxygen-saturated aqueous solution containing the seed and the oxygen depletion is monitored for the diluted solution.|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} Warburg constant volume respirometer was developed to describe the effect of oxygen mass transfer on kinetics of bacterial growth or oxygen uptake. Oxygen mass transfer coefficients and oxygen limited reaction rate constants were determined for the system using air, 21 %, 50 %, and 100 % oxygen gas phases. The equations developed are Non-Limited Oxygen Uptake Oxygen Limited Oxygen Uptake Substrate Limited Oxygen Uptake occurred in the range 60 - 110 mg/ 1 oxygen uptake for air systems. The mass transfer coefficient K 1 a was 0. 264 liters/hr for fifty milliliter samples, 72 min- 1 shake rate at 20 °C. The oxygen limited reaction rate constant can be calculated from the equation k' = 0. 0105 /P - 0. 00363 [33] Constants for equation could not be evaluated from the data obtained. Equation [15 a] predicts oxygen uptake values within +/- 5 % of the experimental values for 1. 0 atmospheres oxygen partial pressure +/- 8 % for 0. 50 atmospheres oxygen partial pressure, +/- 25 % for 0. 21 atmospheres oxygen partial pressure, and +/- 30 % for air systems. Equation [15 a] is applicable {{from the point of}} deviation from exponential growth to the point of substrate limitation. Substrate limitation occurs at 36. 2 % of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> for glutamic acid systems and at 29. 8 % of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> for glucose systems. Application of all equations requires knowledge of the equation constants for the particular seed and substrate used. Of the constants the exponential growth rate constant and the point of deviation from exponential growth are undefined and vary widely with seed material. Equating equations [5] and [15 a] give the initial point for equation [15 a]. Equations to describe carbon dioxide partial pressure within the Warburg: system were developed. Calculated car-bon dioxide partial pressures indicate that carbon dioxide is not limiting in the Warburg system. The equations were not subject to verification in the study reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{anaerobic}} degradation of polymeric materials was studied in batch tests by {{determination of the}} conversion yields to volatile fatty acids (acidogenesis) or to methane (methanogenesis). By both methods, filter paper, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), and two starch‐containing plastic materials (low and high starch contents) were examined with glucose and polyethylene as positive and negative control, respectively. Conversion yields were {{expressed in terms of}} <b>Theoretical</b> <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Demand</b> (ThOD). Methanogenesis and acidogenesis are basically analogous with respect to the final conversion yield. PHB and filter paper show a high conversion yield, comparable to glucose. The material with low amount of starch additive presents very low conversion yields, whereas the starch‐based material is significantly degraded, even if in percentages not higher than starch content. Acidogenic tests are always quicker than methanogenic tests. The rate determining step is generally the hydrolysis of the particulate substrate in the case of acidogenesis and the methane formation in case of methanogenesis. Moreover, acidogenesis appears less sensitive to inhibition in the presence of sulphate. For these reasons, monitoring VFA production after chemical inhibition of methanogenesis can be a good alternative to methane monitoring for assessing anaerobic biodegradability of polymeric materials...|$|E

In contrast, {{it may be possible}} to add novel, biodegradable bioplastics to anaerobic digesters at municipal water resource recovery facilities along with primary sludge to produce more biomethane. In this study, thermal and chemical bioplastic pretreatments were first investigated to increase the rate and extent of anaerobic digestion. Subsequently, replicate, bench-scale anaerobic co-digesters fed synthetic primary sludge with and without PHB bioplastic were maintained for over 170 days. Two polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), one poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 4 -hydroxybutyrate) and one polylactic acid (PLA) bioplastic were investigated. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays were performed using both untreated bioplastic as well as bioplastic pretreated at elevated temperature (35 – 90 °C) under alkaline conditions (8 <pH< 12) for 3 – 48 h. PHB and PLA pretreatment increased average BMP values up to over 100 %. Average PHB lag time before methane production started decreased when pretreatment was performed. Bench-scale anaerobic co-digesters fed synthetic primary sludge with PHB bioplastic resulted in 80 – 98 % conversion of two PHB bioplastics to biomethane and a 5 % biomethane production increase at the organic loadings employed (sludge OLR = 3. 6 g COD per L of reactor volume per day [g COD/LR-d]; bioplastic OLR = 0. 75 g <b>theoretical</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> per L of reactor volume per day [ThOD/LR-d]) compared to digesters not fed bioplastics.

40|$|In 2008, {{the first}} Proficiency Testing Scheme of Chemical Oxygen Demand (1 st COD-PTADG) was {{conducted}} to assess the results obtained for different research groups whose field work is mainly anaerobic digestion. This study was performed using four samples, two solid samples as raw materials and two solid samples to prepare high concentration suspended solid solutions. Invitations were sent to {{a large number of}} laboratories, mainly to anaerobic digestion research groups. Finally, thirty labs from sixteen countries agreed to participate, but for different reasons four participants could not send any data. In total, twenty-six results were reported to the COD-PT coordinator. This study showed the importance of continuous participation in proficiency testing (PT) schemes in order to compare the results obtained. Taking into account the lack of a general standard method and high quality certified reference materials (CRMs), the traceability of COD determination is not currently easy to check. In addition, the spread of participants’ results obtained was high and pointed to the advisability of using consensus values due to their unreliability. Therefore, the <b>theoretical</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> (ThOD) values were considered as assigned values for all the samples analysed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to develop and {{evaluate}} design concepts for biological treatment reactors for the purification of spacecraft wastewater prior to reverse osmosis treatment. The motivating factor is that wastewater recovery represents the greatest single potential reduction in the resupply requirements for crewed space missions. Spacecraft wastewater composition was estimated from {{the characteristics of the}} three major component streams: urine/flush water, hygiene water, and atmospheric condensate. The key characteristics of composite spacecraft wastewater are a <b>theoretical</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> of 4519 mg/L, of which 65 % is nitrogenous oxygen demand, in a volume of 11. 5 liter/crew-day. The organic carbon to nitrogen ratio of composite wastewater is 0. 86. Urine represents 93 % of nitrogen and 49 % of the organic carbon in the composite wastestream. Various bioreaction scenarios were evaluated to project stoichiometric oxygen demands and the ability of wastewater carbon to support denitrification. Ammonia nitrification to the nitrite oxidation state reduced the oxygen requirement and enabled wastewater carbon to provide nearly complete denitrification. A conceptual bioreactor design was established using hollow fiber membranes for bubbleless oxygen transfer in a gravity-free environment, in close spatial juxtaposition to a second interspaced hollow fiber array for supplying molecular hydrogen. Highly versatile redox control and an enhanced ability to engineer syntrophic associations are stated advantages. A prototype reactor was constructed using a microporous hollow fiber membrane module for aeration. Maintaining inlet gas pressure within 0. 25 psi of the external water pressure resulted in bubble free operation with no water ingress into hollow fiber lumens. Recommendations include the design and operational testing of hollow fiber bioreactors using: 1) Partial nitrification/nitrite predenitrification; 2) Limited aeration for simultaneous nitrification/denitrification or for nitrite reduction/ammonia oxidation; 3) Hydrogenotrophic denitrification...|$|E

A previous study using the Microtox ™ assay indicated that some synthetic alicyclic bicyclics were the most acutely toxic acids tested so it is important that these compounds are identified and their toxicities determined. Using comprehensive multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCxGC-MS) we show that> 100 C 8 - 15 bicyclic acids are typically present in OSPW. Synthesis or purchase facilitated GCxGC retention times of methyl esters of these acids to be established and their mass spectra compared with unknowns. Having identified numerous alicyclic bicyclic acids by comparison with authentic standards, we suggest that many of the remaining unknowns are simply analogues of the identified acids with longer alkanoate chains and/or alkyl substituents. Previously we reported the predicted toxicities of a range of NA, many of which had been identified in OSPW, but the alicyclic bicyclic acid structures modelled had only been found in commercial NA mixtures or crude oil. Now, having identified numerous novel acids, we report their toxicities to Pimephales promelas (fathead minnow), the protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis and the water flea Daphnia magna as predicted by Admet Predictor ™ (Simulations Plus). Also, neural network ensemble models were used to assess a compound's likelihood of binding to the estrogen or androgen receptors. Furthermore, the persistence of NA is a huge problem for the oil sands extraction industries so the likelihood of biodegradation was also modelled.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the Salt and Mud Slough tributaries as sources of <b>oxygen</b> <b>demanding</b> materials entering the San Joaquin River (SJR). Mud Slough and Salt Slough are the main drainage arteries of the Grasslands Watershed, a 370, 000 -acre area west of the SJR, covering portions of Merced and Fresno Counties. Although these tributaries of the SJR are typically classified as agricultural, they are also heavily influenced by Federal, State and private wetlands. The majority of the surface water used for both irrigation and wetland management in the Grassland Watershed is imported from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta through the Delta-Mendota Canal. In this study, they measured algal biomass (as chlorophyll a), organic carbon, ammonia, biochemical <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> (BOD), and other measures of water quality in drainage from both agricultural and wetland sources at key points in the Salt Slough and Mud Slough tributaries. This report includes the data collected between June 16 th and October 4 th, 2001. The objective of the study was to compare agricultural and wetland drainage in the Grasslands Watershed and to determine the relative importance of each return flow source to the concentration and mass loading of <b>oxygen</b> <b>demanding</b> materials entering the SJR. Additionally, they compared the quality of water exiting our study area to water entering our study area.

This {{is believed to be the}} first work using the log-phase seeding technique in shortening the time to the plateau in oxygen utilization and in the formulation of oxidative assimilation relationships in mixed microbial populations. Previous work on the effects of log-phase seeding and microbial assimilations generally utilized pure cultures and heavy innocula of bacteria with short incubation periods. Substrates studied in this investigation were glucose, glutamic acid, a (1 : 1) mixture of glucose and glutamic acid, aspartic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and lactose. Both Warburg and dilution techniques were utilized. The log-phase seeding technique produced a marked reduction in lag for all of the substrates and a reduction in time to reach the plateau for lactose, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and propionic acid. The general pattern of the progression of biochemical degradation of soluble substrates in shown in graph form. The plateau in oxygen utilization was highly reproducible and was characteristic for a specific substrate. Based on the data obtained, oxidative assimilation equations were developed for the substrates under study.

40|$|VI Abstract This Master’s thesis {{was done}} for Borealis Polymers Oy in {{co-operation}} with Chalmers University of Technology. The research concentrated on the load of petrochemical waste waters. Borealis’ Petrochemical plants consist of cracker, butadiene, benzene, cumene and phenol plants. There are two waste water systems in Borealis Polymers Petrochemical plants: phenolic waters (PW) and oily waters (OW) which were studied separately. The phenol plant discharges its waste water to both systems, while other plants discharge only to OW-system. The loads of waste waters were assessed with two methods. The first method was chemical oxygen demand and the second method {{was to assess the}} quality of waste water streams from plants. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was studied with <b>theoretical</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> (ThOD) analysis. The quality of different waste water streams were assessed by taking samples from waste waters generated in the plants. In phenolic waters, the ThOD was mostly caused by methanol and phenol. In OW-system the contribution to COD-load was divided more equally between all the components found in the waste waters. Petrochemical waste waters contain a variety of different components, so ThOD analysis based only on known components did not give a full answer how different sorts of chemicals contribute to COD. On average the determined ThOD was one fifth of measured in COD in phenolic waters and one third of measured COD in oily waters. In the phenol plant the load originated from the effluent stripper and methylhydroperoxide (MHP) reactor to the phenolic waters. When the quality of waste waters was studied, the MHP-reactor was the main contributor to the load to biological treatment feed, biolsy. It is recommended that the known components should be analysed also from the outlet of the MHP-reactor continuously. The waste water from the MHP-reactor contained high concentrations of cumene and phenol. Also because of the high phenol and cumene content of the water, it should be treated either in effluent stripper or in the OW-stripper. The cracker was responsible for benzene, toluene, xylenes and phenol load to oily waters system. The phenol and aromatics were responsible for methanol, and total nitrogen load. The known components should be continuously analysed from all the main waste water sources; the diluting steam generator, the NaOH and FCC washing steps, the carbonyl wash, the OW-stripper and the ejector waters. The streams that contained high hydrocarbon concentrations should be treated in OW-stripper and streams that contained phenol should be treated in effluent stripper. The reduction of load is difficult even impossible if the reduction concentrates only on the total load, measured either from pit 27 in case of the OW-system or from the biolsy in case of phenolic waters. Firstly the variety of components in the final stream increases because waste waters from different plants are aggregated. The reduction of different kinds of components is difficult, because of different nature of components. In the final stream also the components are diluted, which also makes the reduction of components more difficult. The reduction of components can be more efficient if it is carried out at the origin of the load...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{crops and}} crop {{residues}} can be digested anaerobically either alone or as co-substrate to produce biogas, a versatile renewable energy source. In the agricultural sector, this biomass is often co-digested with animal manure and slurry, {{one of the}} most significant agricultural waste streams. In spite of the growing number of agricultural biogas plants using agricultural waste and energy crops, the use of process simulation models for predicting and defining plant behaviour is still very limited, mainly due to the complexity of the process and the heterogeneity of the substrates. Also, the lack of standardized substrate characterisation methodology contributes to this issue. The chemical oxygen demand (COD), widely used as a mass balance term in modelling of wastewater treatment plants, could be applied in this field. However, COD is difficult to measure in the case of heterogeneous and solid substrates, including samples with high solids content. This, in turn, has limited its use to date to evaluate substrate biodegradability over time and methane production potential in the field of co-digestion of agricultural by-products. This research paper reports and analyses experimental results on the applicability of COD as a substrate characterisation and process monitoring parameter in the context of lignocellulosic biomass digestion, as collected from the research work currently being undertaken at the University of Luxembourg. The reliability of this parameter was investigated using different silages. Four sets of batch experiments were carried out using maize silage (12. 17 gVS/l), grass silage (14. 58 gVS/l), and two co-digestion mixtures of 40 % maize and 60 % grass (18. 31 gVS/l) and 70 % maize and 30 % grass (12 gVS/l) in 1 litre reactors running under mesophilic conditions. The reactors were inoculated with pre-acclimatized inoculum from Beckerich agricultural biogas plant in Luxembourg. Soluble and particulate COD, volatile solids (VS), total solids (TS), volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and gas production, including composition, were monitored over a period of 24 days. A few adapted analytical procedures for measuring COD in solid and heterogeneous substrates and samples with high suspended solids concentration, in comparison to standard methods widely used for wastewater, have been proposed in recent years but these have rarely been applied and validated in the field of digestion of agricultural by-products. The COD methodology adopted in this study was developed by the process research group at the University of Luxembourg as a modification of the DIN 38414 -S 9 considering some suggestions from Raposo et al. (2008). The modified COD method was applied to different substrates (i. e. grass, maize silages, and cellulose) and also to monitor particulate COD (pCOD) evolution during anaerobic digestion of the different silages. The soluble COD (sCOD) method as established in the ISO 15705 standard method was modified for these experiments as the digestate has relatively high suspended solids concentration. First, the measured substrate COD concentration was compared with the <b>theoretical</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> for each substrate. COD recovery obtained was 96 % for cellulose, 92. 5 % on average for the different maize silages tested and 91. 5 % on average for the grass silages tested. For all different batch series, the pCOD decreased overtime as a result of the hydrolysis of the particulate fraction of the substrate. The pCOD evolution along with the methane accumulative yield suggested that the solubilisation of the substrate was slower in the case of the co-digestion experiments. sCOD, on the other hand, initially increased sharply as a result of the solubilisation of the substrate and subsequent acidification and then decreased as digestion progressed. After 9 days of digestion, 77 %, 71 %, 69 % and 48 % substrate to methane conversion rates had been achieved for the experiments fed with grass silage, maize silage, the 70 % maize/ 30 % grass mixture and the 40 % maize/ 60 % grass mixture, respectively. Measuring the pCOD and sCOD together with biogas and VFAs concentration during digestion allows, not only to estimate the degradation advancement through COD mass balance, but also to obtain relevant information about the solubilisation of the particulate fraction (hydrolysis step) ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: World {{crude oil}} demand and {{production}} {{is set to}} increase {{in the long term}} and is projected to increase from 82 barrels per day in 2007 to an estimated 104 million barrels per day in 2030 according to the International Energy Agency. The environmental challenges posed by the current and projected increased future fuel use, with specific reference to air, aquatic and terrestrial impact, are driving producers and legislators to change fuel specifications and consequently fuel properties to be less harmful to the environment. Traditionally transportation fuels are produced through crude oil refining but in South Africa more than one third of the liquid fuels are produced synthetically through catalytic conversion of gassified coal via the Fischer-Tropsch process by Sasol. Diesel from syncrude is referred to as synthetic diesel and the refiner must blend various hydrocarbon streams, effectively tailoring the diesel to its final composition. Biodiesel from renewable sources like vegetable oils is considered environmentally more acceptable than petrodiesel because of its high biodegradability in the environment, lower sulphur and aromatic hydrocarbon content as well as lowered particulate content in the exhaust emissions. The present research was aimed at evaluating whether the composition of diesels derived from different feed stocks, that included coal, natural gas, crude oil and soybean oil, would influence its biodegradability and ecotoxicity. Acute aquatic tests that included freshwater fish, crustaceans, algae and marine bacteria were used to determine the acute toxicity of diesels. In addition, quantitative structure activity relationship models were used to estimate the biodegradation and ecotoxicity properties of the diesels in an attempt to develop a cost effective tool to determine those properties. The results indicated that the 2 -D GC technique quantitatively and qualitatively identified the hydrocarbon constituents in the diesels. The relevance of using the 2 -D GC technique was in identifying and quantifying the hydrocarbon breakdown products and being used in a mass balance to confirm the potential biological breakdown processes of the materials used in the present study. The differences in <b>theoretical</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> (ThOD) of the different experimental diesel blends using various blending materials and biodiesel, emphasised and confirmed the importance of calculating the ThOD for the respective blending materials when measuring the biodegradation rates. Furthermore, the biodegradation hierarchy of Pitter and Chudoba (1990) in order of decreasing biodegradability: alkanes > branched alkanes > cyclo-alkanes > aromatic hydrocarbons, could be expanded to include FAME: FAME > alkanes > branched alkanes > cyclo-alkanes > aromatic hydrocarbons. The biochemical pathways identified for the biodegradation of all the diesels was enzyme-enhanced β-oxidation. The present research also indicated that biodiesel addition to crude-derived diesels to increase the density to within the current required specifications for diesels cannot be a reality in SA because of the underdeveloped biodiesel industry. To increase the density by using biodiesel to within the specification for GTL diesel, more than 27 % biodiesel would be required, which is currently is not achievable from an economic perspective as well as governmental national strategy perspective. The addition of biodiesel as lubricity enhancer seems more plausible, because less than 5 % would be required for petrodiesels. The results on the ecotoxicity of the diesels and diesel blends demonstrated a general lack of acute toxic effect, especially for the fish and crustaceans used during the present study. Although algal and bacterial tests showed an effect at most of the WAF loading rates, none were high enough to enable the calculation of a median effect loading rate (EL 50). QSAR‟s, like EPI Suite, together with prediction models, like the Fisk Ecotoxicity Estimation Model, can be used to screen for ecotoxicity and biodegradability of hydrocarbons found in Petrodiesels. It was less applicable for the prediction of biodiesel constituents. The use of different cut-off values for the constituents of biodiesel could be developed in future research. The use of this combination enabled the present research into the potential toxicity of hydrocarbon mixtures to be conducted, especially since tests on individual constituents are impractical. QSAR‟s may provide a relatively cost-effective way to screen for potential environmental acceptability of such mixtures. The contributors to the toxicity of mixtures of hydrocarbons found in diesels were evaluated and it appears that paraffins contribute more to the overall toxicity than previously thought and aromatics less. By putting well-defined policies and incentives in place, a robust biodiesel industry could be created that will enable SA to contribute to the mitigation of the threat of climate change, to become less dependent on foreign oil and to develop rural agriculture. The key to energy security is not one solution to South Africa‟s energy needs, but a multifaceted approach to the complex subject of sustainable energy security. The end of the hydrocarbon era of energy is not in sight, at least for the near future, but soon even hydrocarbon energy in the form of coal and crude oil will have to be re-evaluated as SA‟s major energy resource for economic and energy security. In SA the potential of developing natural gas resources through fracking, nuclear, solar, wind, biological and even wastes to energy processes as well as better energy efficiency, in a balanced and diverse energy portfolio, could pave the way toward energy security in the long run. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Ru-olie aanvraag en produksie wêreldwyd is besig om toe te neem en die Internasionale Energie Agentskap projekteer dat wêreld ru-olie verbruik sal toeneem van 82 vate per dag in 2007 tot „n beraamde 104 vate per dag in 2030. Die omgewings uitdagings wat huidige en toekomstige toename in brandstof verbruik, spesifiek die impak op lug gehalte, water- en grond, mag hê, is dryfvere vir produseerders en reguleerders om brandstof spesifikasies te verander om minder omgewings impak te veroorsaak. Brandstof vir vervoer doeleindes word oor die algemeen van ru-olie gemaak, maar in Suid Afrika word ongeveer „n derde van die vloeibare brandtof gemaak deur middel van gekatiliseerde omskakeling van vergasde steenkool via die Fischer-Tropsch proses by Sasol. Diesel wat uit sintetiese ru-olie gemaak is, is sinteties en die raffineerder moet verskillende koolwaterstof strome meng om „n finale produk te lewer. Biodiesel wat uit hernubare hulpbronne soos plant-olies en diervet gemaak word, kan oorweeg word vir die vervaardiging van meer omgewings aanvaarbare brandstof met laer swael en aromatiese koolwaterstof inhoud en ook minder partikel inhoud in die uitlaatgas. Die huidige navorsing het beoog om te evalueer of die samestelling van diesels wat vervaardig is uit verskillende hulpbronne, wat steenkool, aardgas, ru-olie en sojaboon olie ingesluit het, die biodegradeerbaarheid en ekotoksisiteit kan beïnvloed. Akute akwatiese toetse wat varswater vis, krustaseë, alge en marine bakterieë ingesluit het, was aangewend om die akute toksisiteit van die diesels te bepaal. Kwantitatiewe struktuur aktiwiteit verwantskaps modelle is ook gebruik om die biodegradeerbaarheid en ekotoksisiteits eienskappe van die diesels te beraam om vas te stel of 'n bekostigbare alternatief beskikbaar is om daardie eienskappe te bepaal. Die resultate het aangedui dat die 2 D GC tegniek kwantitatief en kwalitatief gebruik kan word om die koolwaterstowwe in die diesels te identifiseer. Die benutting van die 2 D GC tegnieke is egter om die koolwaterstof afbraak produkte te identifiseer en ook om die massa balans gedurende die biodegradering te bevestig. Die verskil in teoretiese suurstof aanvraag van die verskillende diesels het die belangrikheid daarvan blemtoon en bevestig om die teoretiese suurstof aanvraag korrek te bereken en sodoende die biodegradasie korrek te bepaal. Verder kan die biodegradasie hierargie van Pitter en Chudoba (1990) volgens afnemende biodegradasie: alkane > vertakte alkane > siklo-alkane > aromatiese koolwaterstowwe, uitgebrei word om vetsuur-metielesters in te sluit: vetsuur-metielesters > alkane > vertakte alkane > siklo-alkane > aromatiese koolwaterstowwe. Die biochemiese roetes wat geïdentifiseer is vir die biodegradasie van die diesels, was ensiem-verbeterde β-oksidasie. Die huidige navorsing het ook aangedui dat biodiesel toevoeging tot ru-olie vervaardigde diesel om die digtheid te verhoog to binne huidige spesifikasies is nog nie lewensvatbaar in Suid Afrika nie as gevolg van die onderontwikkelde biodiesel industrie. Om die digtheid te verhoog met biodiesel tot binne spesifikasie verg meer as 27 % biodiesel en is huidiglik nie haalbaar vanuit 'n ekonomiese persketief en ook nie vanuit 'n regerings nasionale strategie perspektief nie. Die toevoeging van biodiesel as lubrisiteits vervetering blyk meer van toepassing te wees aangesien minder as 5 % biodiesel toevoeging benodig sou wees. Die resultate van die ekotoksisiteits toetse het 'n algemene gebrek aan akute toksisiteits effek aangedui, veral vir vis en skaaldiere wat in die huidige studie gebruik is. Howel alge en bakteriële toetse daarop gedui het dat 'n toksiese effek wel aanwesig was, was dit gering en kon die median effektiewe ladings koers (EL 50) nie bepaal word nie. QSARs, soos Epi Suite, tesame met voospellings modelle, soos die Fisk Ecotoxicity Estimation Model, kan gebruik word om ekotoksisiteit en biodegradeerbaarheid van koolwaterstowwe in petrodiesels te beraam, alhoewel dit minder van toepassing was op biodiesel. Die gebruik van ander afsny waardes spesifiek vir biodiesel kan oorweeg word in toekomstige navorsing. Die molecules wat bygedra het tot die toksisiteit van die koolwaterstof mengsels was geëvalueeren daar is gevind dat die paraffiniese molekules meer begedra het tot die totale toksisiteit en die aromate minder. Deur goed gedefinieerde beleid en aansporings meganismes inplek te sit, kan 'n biodiesel industrie in SA geskep word wat SA sal help om by te dra tot die bekamping van klimaats vendering en sodoende minder afhanklik te wees van buitelandse olie en ook landbou in SA te bevorder. Die sluetel tot energie sekuriteit is nie een oplossing vir SA se energie aanvraag nie, maar eerder 'n veelsydige benadering tot die komplekse onderwerp van volhoubare energie sekuriteit. Die einde van koolwaterstof energie is nog nie in sig nie, ten miste nie in die nabye toekoms nie, maar binnekort sal selfs koolwaterstof energie in die vorm van steenkool en ru-olie heroorweeg moet word as SA se hoof energie hulpbronne vir ekonomiese en energie sekuriteit. In SA moet die potensiaal van natuurlike gas ontginning deur middel van hidrauliese breking, kernkrag, wind energie, biologiese energie en selfs afval tot energie prosesse bestudeer word, so-ook beter energie doeltreffendheid om sodoende 'n gebalansweerde energie portefuelje te skep wat die weg sal baan na energie sekuriteit op die lang termyn...|$|E
