40|$|Cultural objects {{including}} images, languages, and hairstyles now move {{ever more}} swiftly across {{regional and national}} boundaries. ✶ This acceleration {{is a consequence of}} the speed and spread of the internet and the simultaneous, comparative growth in travel, cross-cultural media and global advertisement. The power of global corporations to outsource various aspects of their activities, ranging from manufacture and distribution to advertising and commerce, has meant that the force of global capital is now multiplied by the opportunistic combination of cultural idioms, symbols, labor pools and attitudes to profit and risk. Additionally, this volatile and exploding <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> commodities, styles, and information has been matched by the growth of both flows of cultural politics, visible most powerfully in the discourse of human rights, but also in the new languages of radical Christianity and Islam, and the discourse of civil society activists, who wish to promote their own versions of global equity, entitlement, and citizenship. The dynamics of modernization remain an essential feature of global cultural flows. Global corporations now compete for markets, such as bio-technology, digital media, drinking water, energy credits, financial derivatives (as we now know) and other commodity markets, which barely existed before 1970. At the same time, illegal or unofficial markets have emerged everywhere, linking societies and states {{in different parts of the}} world. These lateral markets which involve <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs,</b> armaments, precious metals, and sex work, to name but four examples, make extensive use of the power of the internet, of satellites using cell phones and other sophisticated communications technologies. They also take full advantage of the differential policing of national boundaries, of the destruction of many rural economies, and the corruption of state that characterizes many parts of the world. Such illegal commodity circuits, for example in Africa, also bring apparently desolate economies to major ports and commercia...|$|R

Articles 390-395 of the Penal Code prohibit forced prostitution and forced or bonded labor, prescribing penalties of two to eight years' imprisonment, which are commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious offenses. Statistics on investigations or criminal convictions are not made publicly available. The government has strengthened its partnership with the International Organization for Migration, through which it provided for the training of police officers, law enforcement officials, prosecutors, NGOs, and stakeholders <b>in</b> <b>trafficking</b> awareness and effective measures to counter trafficking. At the local level, police and military officials have been implicated in facilitating the illegal entry of foreigners into the diamond-mining provinces of Lunda North and Lunda South, some of whom reportedly become victims of forced labor or prostitution in the mining camps. The UN Joint Human Rights Office reported in May 2009 that Congolese officials broke up a sex trafficking ring that had [...] "sold" [...] more than 30 trafficked women and girls to Angolan military personnel in Cabinda province.

40|$|Organ transplantation, one of {{the medical}} miracles of the twentieth century, has {{prolonged}} and improved the lives {{of hundreds of thousands}} of patients worldwide. The many great scientific and clinical advances of dedicated health professionals, as well as countless acts of generosity by organ donors and their families, have made transplantation not only a life-saving therapy but a shining symbol of human solidarity. Yet these accomplishments have been tarnished by numerous reports of <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>human</b> beings who are used as sources of organs and of patient-tourists from rich countries who travel abroad to purchase organs from poor people. In 2004, the World Health Organization, called on member states “to take measures to protect the poorest and vulnerable groups from transplant tourism and the sale of tissues and organs, including attention to the wider problem of international <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>human</b> tissues and <b>organs</b> ” (1).

At {{the other end of the}} spectrum are sophisticated and well-funded ventures that are highly professional and have the benefit of legal and financial advice that allows them to operate across several countries with relative impunity.

40|$|Organ {{transplantation}} {{dates back}} to the ancient times and since then it {{has become one of the}} important developments in modern medicine; saving the lives, as well as improving the quality of life of many patients. As the demand for organ transplantation far exceeds the organ availability, the transplant program is often saddled with complex legal and ethical issues. This review article highlights the legal and ethical issues that might arise regarding organ transplantation and appraises the existing legal frame work governing organ transplantation in Nigeria. Information on legal, cultural, religious and medical ethical issues regarding organ transplantation in Nigeria was obtained by searching the PubMed and Google Scholar, conference proceedings, seminar paper presentations, law library and other related publications were collated and analyzed. In decision making for organ transplantation, the bioethical principles like autonomy, beneficence and justice must be employed. It was believed by Catholic theologians that to mutilate one living person to benefit another violates the principle of Totality. Among Muslim scholars and researchers, there are those who throw legal support as to its permissibility while the other group sees it as illegal. Organ/tissues transplantation is considered a medical intervention that touches on the fundamental rights of the donor or the recipient. Where there is an unlawful infringement of the right of such persons in any way may be regarded as against Section 34 of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution dealing with right to dignity of the human person. Worldwide, the researchers and government bodies have agreed on informed consent for organ/tissue donation and for recipient should be obtained without coercion before embarking on such medical treatment Worldwide organ transplantation has become the best medical treatment for patients with end stage organ failure. However, there is no law/legislation backing organ/tissues transplantation in Nigeria. The government should take measures to combat transplantation tourism and the problem of national and international <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>human</b> tissues and <b>organs,</b> ethics commission and National Transplant registry should be established in order to monitor and regulate the programme in the country...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{whether a}} {{regulated}} market <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> should be legalized. The main {{focus will be}} on the arguments given by philosophers James Stacey Taylor and Michael Sandel regarding the discussion of legalization. In addition to this it is analyzed and later concluded whether the term dignity can be a reasonable argument in the above mentioned discussion. The study examines dignity through an analysis of the term and how it is defined in four selected historical periods and its significance {{in the context of a}} regulated market <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs.</b> It is hereby concluded that it is somewhat impossible to provide a precise definition of dignity in modern society; hence it cannot be used in the discussion of whether a regulated market <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> is morally permissible. Through an analysis and discussion of the aforementioned philosophers’ arguments, it is concluded that Taylor argues that a regulated market <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> ought to be legalized. It is noted that Sandel does not explicitly discuss this particular subject, but instead focuses on the immoral factors of market transactions in general. It is therefore concluded that he would also find a regulated market <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> to be immoral. The study finally concludes that the arguments given by Sandel are not reasonable and thus cannot be accepted in the review of whether or not a regulated market <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> should be legalized. In contrast to this it is found that the arguments given by Taylor have defeated the challenges thrown at them. On account of the above it is concluded that a regulated market <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> ought to be legalized and that it is a morally permissible decision...|$|R

40|$|Nancy Scheper‐Hughes {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} critics of markets <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs.</b> Unfortunately, Scheper‐Hughes rejects the view that markets should be used to solve the current (and chronic) shortage of transplant organs without engaging with the arguments in favour of them. Scheper‐Hughes's rejection of such markets is of especial concern, given her influence over their future, for she holds, among other positions, the status of an adviser to the World Health Organization (Geneva) on issues related to global transplantation. Given her influence, it is important that Scheper‐Hughes's moral condemnation of markets <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> be subject to critical assessment.

A careful examination of Scheper‐Hughes's anti‐market stance shows that it is based on serious mischaracterisations of both the pro‐market position and the medical and economic realities that underlie it.
