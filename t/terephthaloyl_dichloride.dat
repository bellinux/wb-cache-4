50|$|Twaron is a p-phenylene terephthalamide (PpPTA), the {{simplest}} {{form of the}} AABB para polyaramide. PpPTA {{is a product of}} p-phenylene diamine (PPD) and <b>terephthaloyl</b> <b>dichloride</b> (TDC). To dissolve the aromatic polymer Twaron used a co-solvent of N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) and an ionic component (calcium chloride CaCl2) to occupy the hydrogen bonds of the amide groups. The invention of this specific process was done in 1974 at AKZO Research Laboratory in Arnhem by a team consisting of Leo Vollbracht, Teun Veerman (assistant of Leo Vollbracht) and Wim Engelhard (trainee, who actually discovered NMP as the appropriate solvent to keep the growing polymer as long as possible in solution; he also discovered that high speed mixing of PPD and TDC was necessary to obtain a sufficiently long polymer chains). The patent of the newly discovered process route led to a patent war between AKZO (Fibre X) and DuPont (Fibre B) as Dupont initially used the carcinogenic HMPT (hexamethylphosphoramide). Despite heavy research DuPont now also applies the AKZO patent for their Kevlar process and use the less hazardous NMP.|$|E

40|$|Jojoba oil {{containing}} polyamide microcapsules having {{diameter of}} approximately 5 microm were prepared by inter-facial polycondensation by direct method (oil-in-water). Qualitative effects {{of both the}} formulation and the process parameters on microcapsules characteristics were investigated by SEM observations. Morphological analysis showed the dependence of the external membrane compactness on the chemical nature of the water-soluble polyamine and the oil-soluble acid polychloride: 1, 6 -hexamethylenediamine (HMDA) and <b>terephthaloyl</b> <b>dichloride</b> (TDC) were found to favour the production of smooth and dense surfaces.

The reaction of compounds 2, 3, and 4 with DMAD or DEAD {{led to the}} formation of 4 -oxothiozolidine derivatives (4 b–c), (3 a-c), and (2 c-d).

Decarbonylative polyadditions of diyne monomers [bis(4 -ethynylphenyl) dimethylsilane, 4, 4 ′-diethynylbiphenyl, and 1, 2 -bis(4 -ethynylphenyl) - 1, 2 -diphenylethene] with respective <b>terephthaloyl</b> <b>dichloride</b> and benzene- 1, 3, 5 -tricarbonyl trichloride catalyzed by [Rh(cod) Cl] 2 /PPh 3, [Rh(nbd) Cl] 2 /PPh 3, [RhCp*Cl 2] 2 /PPh 3, [Rh(cod) (PPh 3) 2]+PF 6 −, or [Rh(cod) (PPh 2) (CH 2) 4 (PPh 2) ]+BF 4 − (cod = 1, 5 -cyclooctadiene, nbd = 2, 5 -norbornadiene, Cp* = pentamethyl cyclopentadienyl), proceed smoothly, producing linear and hyperbranched poly(arylene chloroZ-vinylene) s (PACVs) in regio- and stereoselective manners with high molecular weights (absolute Mw up to 5. 31 × 105) in high yields (up to 92 %). Model reactions are designed to confirm the chemical structures of the PACVs. The resultant polymers are processable and enjoy high thermal stability. The linear PAVCs can undergo thermal curing at high temperatures and compared with their hyperbranched counterparts, they are more electronically conjugated due to the para-conjugation effect, as revealed by both experimental and theoretical studies. The light emissions of linear PAVCs with twisted tetraphenylethene units are enhanced by aggregate formation, demonstrating an unusual aggregation-enhanced emission characteristic...|$|E

The solid residues of all samples were analysed by FT-IR and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). Compared to conventional PPTA (poly(p-phenylene terephthamide)), PPAA (poly(phosphazene-aryl amide)) shows excellent thermal stability and solubility in polar protic solvents. All poly(phosphazene-aryl amides) show two thermal degradation in the temperature range 150 &# 8211; 600 °C.

Amino acids used here were alanine (1, 5), isoleucine (2), leucine (3) and valine (4). Crystalline forms of four amino acid substituted terephthalamides (2, 2 ′-(terephthaloylbis(azanediyl)) dipropanoic acid dihydrate 1; 2, 2 ′-(terephthaloylbis(azanediyl)) bis(3 - methylpentanoic acid) monohydrate 2; 2, 2 ′-(terephthaloylbis(azanediyl)) bis(4 -methylpentanoic acid) dihydrate 3; 2, 2 ′-(terephthaloylbis(azanediyl)) bis(3 -methylbutanoic acid) dihydrate 4) and one benzene- 1, 3, 5 -tricarboxamide molecule (2, 2 ′, 2 ′′-((benzene- 1, 3, 5 -tricarbonyl) tris(azanediyl)) tripropionic acid hemihydrate 5) were characterised and the single crystal structures were solved. All the compounds form hydrogen bonded 2 D and 3 D nets. Linear connecting amino acid derivatives can be categorised into three groups depending on the hydrogen bond patterns and final structures. Compounds 1 and 2 form 3 D structures but the final structure is different due to the different hydrogen bond synthons. Compounds 3 and 4 are isostructural and form 2 D hydrogen bonded structures while 5 forms a hydrogen bonded pcu-net.

40|$|Composite {{coatings}} {{consisting of}} a metal matrix in which ceramic particles are embedded have recently been developed and used in industry as wear-resistant coatings. The present paper deals {{with the development of}} oil-containing self-lubricating metallic coatings. These have been produced by electrolytic codeposition of oil-containing microcapsules from Watts nickel plating baths. For this purpose, oil-containing polyterephthalamide microcapsules were synthesized based on the interfacial polymerization of an oil-soluble monomer (<b>terephthaloyl</b> <b>dichloride)</b> and a mixture of two water-soluble monomers (diethylenetriamine and 1, 6 -hexamethylenediamine). The influence of several synthesis parameters (e. g. type of encapsulated organic phase, monomer concentration(s) and concentration ratio of the two amine monomers) on the size distribution and morphology of the oil-containing polyamide microcapsules as well as on their electrolytic codeposition behaviour is discussed. As revealed by scanning electron microscopy analysis, the morphological characteristics of the microcapsules were affected to a great extent by the functionality of the water-soluble amine monomer. Furthermore, the composition of the core material of the microcapsules showed a marked influence on their stability upon aging in the Watts nickel plating bath. Finally, codeposition experiments using a laboratory rotating electrode showed that the level of codeposition was influenced by the presence of additives in the nickel electrolyte and was strongly dependent on the polymerization conditions employed in the microcapsule synthesis. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{scalable}} {{method for}} {{the synthesis of}} polyethylene terephthalamide microcapsules grafted with polyacrylic acid to enable pH responsiveness has been developed. Microcapsules were produced by interfacial polymerisation of an oil-in-water emulsion in a 2 L batch reactor and subsequently circulated through an external loop reactor for UV irradiative surface grafting. Ungrafted microcapsule samples yielded 1. 0 - 1. 2 g desiccated capsules per experiment. Initial production trials were subject to severe agglomeration, observed during dialysis of the microcapsules with 30 % (v/v) ethanol solution. Lowering of the <b>terephthaloyl</b> <b>dichloride</b> monomer concentration, to 0. 2 mol L⁻¹ in the chloroform / cyclohexane (3 : 1) organic solution, alleviated this unwanted agglomeration. Laser diffraction particle size analysis revealed microcapsules were produced with a 51 µm average diameter. A purpose built external loop irradiation reactor was used to facilitate graft polymerisation of acrylic acid on the microcapsules, using 254 nm UV light at 19 mW cm⁻². Characterisation of the external loop flow regime showed a mild deviation from ideal plug flow, with a vessel dispersion number of 0. 014 and a Reynolds number of 1310. Confirmation of monomer polymerisation was ascertained by back titration and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. No distinction between homopolymer and grafted polyacrylic acid could be made by these characterisation methods. A Taguchi analysis on variables influencing grafting revealed high temperature to contribute most significantly to graft yield, followed by a long irradiation period. The development of a packed column pulse response method for testing pH response showed a high repeatability. However, release profile testing of a microcapsule slurry with an observed graft yield of 1. 13 mmol g⁻¹ did not provide a definitive pH-based release of mPEG 5000 or PEGylated TAMRA dye. Determination of acrylic acid polymerisation kinetics following UV irradiation of the microcapsules is required for future optimisation of a functional graft yield...|$|E
