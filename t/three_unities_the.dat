[...] The play maintains Aristotle's six elements of a tragedy in addition to the <b>three</b> <b>unities.</b> <b>The</b> play's resemblance to a Greek tragedy continues as Greek theater is linked to Dionysus. As the god of ritual madness, he inspires ecstasy that frees his followers from fears and subverts hegemony. Bestiality is considered taboo in contemporary society. Martin's relationship with Sylvia then defies convention. Unlike the other members in the support group, Martin does not understand why bestiality is wrong because he is blinded by love and happiness.|$|E

He is considered as a representant of absurd drama though his first play Yvonne, Princess of Burgundy was written already in 1935 and furthermore he did not declare his attachment to the aesthetics of absurd drama. In addition Gombrowicz was not a theatre lover in a common sense. According to his own words he did not appreciate theatre as a whole. Nevertheless his work is full of references to the principle of theatrality. Despite all the experiments on the fields of topics and language, the three Gombrowicz's plays maintain in principle the classical structure: dramas are locked up in three acts and regarding the formal aspects they are actually the traditional drama pieces, which can be read and played in the same way. "Aristotle's" <b>three</b> <b>unities</b> (<b>the</b> unity of action, the unity of place, the unity of time) are not followed, in this respect the closest link to Gombrowicz's plays leads to the romantic drama, Polish romantic drama in particular (where the time ambuguity is a characteristic feature).

5|$|The Tempest {{differs from}} Shakespeare's other plays in its {{observation}} of a stricter, more organised neoclassical style.

Shakespeare's other plays rarely respected <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>unities,</b> taking place in separate locations miles apart and over several days or even years. The play's events unfold in real time before the audience, Prospero even declaring in the last act that everything has happened in, more or less, three hours. All action is unified into one basic plot: Prospero's struggle to regain his dukedom; it is also confined to one place, a fictional island, which many scholars agree {{is meant to be}} located in the Mediterranean Sea. Another reading suggests that it takes place in the New World, as some parts read like records of English and Spanish conquest in the Americas.

This {{assignment}} {{takes a look}} at {{the relevance}} of the declaration signed on the day of legitimation by future pastors of the Ned. Geref. Kerk.

A hermeneutical approach is used in which the NGK’s <b>three</b> confessions of <b>unity,</b> <b>the</b> Reformed confessional tradition and the history of the NGK aid in testing the relevance of this declaration. The initial role of the signing of confessions as a deed that creates unity and identity helps to show how the current declaration fails to continue with this role. It is therefore necessary that the NGK reconsiders their use and wording of the declaration. The conclusion includes a proposal for an alternative declaration which focuses on responsible hermeneutics rather than the content of teachings...|$|R

Although he accentuated classical dramatic rules or <b>three</b> dramatic <b>unities</b> as <b>the</b> way to construct a good drama, he couldn't escape from the deep rooted romantic feeling of his genius. His plays are thus pictures of existing existential revolt with the protagonists true to their feelings, always consistent, active and devoted to one general idea. They are estranged from the meaningless world that leads them to rebellion and death, but prometheously constructed are the most successful and memorable element of his plays. Byron as a dramatist always tries to find an everlasting dimension and virtue in the meaningless world through the construction of personal myth and thus the main subject of all his dramas is freedom in all its aspects...|$|R
50|$|The {{style of}} Talking to Terrorists is realism, {{since all of}} the characters, sets, and words {{involved}} with the play come from real events, places, and people.

This sort of docudrama/verbatim theatre play feeds off of its ability to “live in a world like ours… and appear logical and believable.” Rush also explains that realism applies to <b>three</b> rules, <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> of time, place, and action to be perceived as believable.|$|R
