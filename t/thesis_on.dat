5|$|At the University of Heidelberg, Goebbels {{wrote his}} {{doctoral}} <b>thesis</b> <b>on</b> Wilhelm von Schütz, a minor 19th century romantic dramatist. He {{had hoped to}} write his thesis {{under the supervision of}} Friedrich Gundolf, who at that time was a well known literary historian. It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. However, Gundolf was no longer performing teaching duties, so he directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg was also Jewish. It was Waldberg who recommended Goebbels write his <b>thesis</b> <b>on</b> Wilhelm von Schütz. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels earned his PhD in 1921.|$|E

He continued his studies at Columbia University, where he was awarded his doctorate for a <b>thesis</b> <b>on</b> the magnetic susceptibility of certain crystals. In 1927, he headed for Europe, where he met and worked with many of the finest physicists of the time.|$|E

5|$|Clark {{graduated}} from the Command and General Staff College (CGSC), earning his military Master of Arts degree in military science from the CGSC with a <b>thesis</b> <b>on</b> American policies of gradualism in the Vietnam War. Clark's theory was one of applying force swiftly, which was being advocated by many soldiers at the time, a concept that would eventually become established as U.S. national security policy {{in the form of}} the Weinberger Doctrine and its successor, the Powell Doctrine. Clark was promoted to major upon his graduation from the CGSC.|$|E
5|$|Harold Innis {{wrote his}} PhD <b>thesis</b> <b>on</b> {{the history of}} the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The {{completion}} of Canada's first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been a defining moment in Canadian history. Innis's thesis, eventually published as a book in 1923, can be seen as an early attempt to document the railway's significance from an economic historian's point of view. It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis maintains that the difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.|$|E
5|$|In 1925–26, while {{teaching}} at the Dalhousie Law School, Macdonald took additional courses in law at Columbia University in New York, mainly by correspondence. He used these courses {{as the basis for}} full-time graduate work at the Harvard Law School in Boston, Massachusetts in 1928. Harvard's faculty members saw the law as an instrument for social improvement. That view was reflected in Macdonald's 1929 doctoral <b>thesis</b> <b>on</b> the responsibility of property holders under civil law.|$|E

5|$|Kistiakowsky {{attended}} {{private schools}} in Kiev and Moscow until the Russian Revolution {{broke out in}} 1917. He then joined the anti-Communist White Army. In 1920 he escaped from Russia in a commandeered French ship. After spending time in Turkey and Yugoslavia, {{he made his way}} to Germany, where he enrolled at the University of Berlin later that year. In 1925, he earned his PhD in physical chemistry under the supervision of Max Bodenstein, writing his <b>thesis</b> <b>on</b> the photochemical decomposition of chlorine monoxide and ozone. He then became Bodenstein's graduate assistant. His first two published papers were elaborations of his thesis, co-written with Bodenstein.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence {{followed}} Swann to the University of Chicago, {{and then}} to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where Lawrence completed his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in physics in 1925 as a Sloane Fellow, writing his doctoral <b>thesis</b> <b>on</b> the photoelectric effect in potassium vapor. He was elected a member of Sigma Xi, and, on Swann's recommendation, received a National Research Council fellowship. Instead of using it to travel to Europe, as was customary at the time, he remained at Yale University with Swann as a researcher.|$|E

5|$|Russian {{scientist}} Peter Kropotkin {{first proposed}} {{the idea of}} fresh water under Antarctic ice sheets {{at the end of}} the 19th century. He theorized that the tremendous pressure exerted by the cumulative mass of thousands of vertical meters of ice could increase the temperature at the lowest portions of the ice sheet to the point where the ice would melt. Kropotkin's theory was further developed by Russian glaciologist I. A. Zotikov, who wrote his Ph.D. <b>thesis</b> <b>on</b> this subject in 1967.|$|E

5|$|Soviet chemist D. K. Dobroserdov was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to claim to have found eka-caesium, or francium. In 1925, he observed weak radioactivity {{in a sample of}} potassium, another alkali metal, and incorrectly concluded that eka-caesium was contaminating the sample (the radioactivity from the sample was from the naturally occurring potassium radioisotope, potassium-40). He then published a <b>thesis</b> <b>on</b> his predictions of the properties of eka-caesium, in which he named the element russium after his home country. Shortly thereafter, Dobroserdov began to focus on his teaching career at the Polytechnic Institute of Odessa, and he did not pursue the element further.|$|E
