40|$|Current {{models for}} Information and Communication Technology (ICT) {{products}} encourage frequent product replacement with newer versions that offer only minor incremental improvements. This pattern, named planned obsolescence, diminishes user experience and shortens product lifespan. This paper presents the conceptual {{basis for a}} two-part integrated approach to combating planned obsolescence in ICT devices. First, design for emotional attachment, which creates products that users enjoy, value, and use for longer. Second, <b>technological</b> <b>adaptability,</b> which anticipates product upgrades and repairs as new technologies emerge. A model interdisciplinary design course in industrial design and sustainability, also described herein, trains students to apply this approach to create innovative ICT products with smaller environmental footprints...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to advance design science by {{developing}} a framework for research on reuse and the relationship between external IT artifacts and their users. A design science approach to IS research needs to grapple with the fact that a number of relevant, economically attractive, external IT artifacts cannot be designed from scratch nor meaningfully evaluated based on the current state of development, and so design science research will struggle with incomplete cycles of design, relevance, and rigor. We suggest a strategic research agenda that integrates the design of the relationship between an external IT artifact and the user by considering the impact artifacts exert on users. Three dimensions derived from adaptive structuration theory inform our framework on three levels of design granularity (middle management, top management, and entrepreneur) : agenda considers the dynamic properties of <b>technological</b> objects, <b>adaptability</b> refers to the functional affordance of external artifacts in development, and auspice captures the symbolic expression and scope for interpretation. We derive implications for research design...|$|R
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} group of {{indicators}} {{in the analysis of}} port performance. Section one presents a new model of analysis to evaluate how the port cargo openness, the productivity level, the cargo expansion, and the <b>technological</b> change <b>adaptability</b> can affect directly on the marginal productivity growth rate and performance of a port. This new model, “The Port Growth Performance Evaluation model (PGPE-Model) ” is intended to offer policy makers and researchers an additional analytical tool to study the impact of dynamic changes such as change in international trade trends an the impact of technology or competition on port performance from a new perspective. The PGPE-Model {{can be applied to the}} study of any production unit or {{a group of}} economic activity and not constrained by geographical area or development stage of the entities on study. The PGPE-Model is simple and flexible. Section two, summarizes the results on the performance of Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan and China. In an era of dynamic global change and supply change where production units change location, the PGPE-Model’s strength is the ability to capture and measure the change, vulnerability and port performance. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The way {{in which}} {{children}} frame their experiences with pedagogical systems arises out of the interplay among the child’s past experiences, exposure to multiple socio-cultural environments, family’s socio-economic status, parental education, the educational system, child’s peers, and individual personality and cognitive ability. An important factor which comes into play here is the socio-cultural relevance of the learning objects, i. e., localization of content to make learning more comprehendible using examples a child is familiar with. Children learn best in environments that are aligned to their cognitive and mental models. With the Indian educational system promoting ICTs in classroom settings, Indian tweens are increasingly embracing the digital world for leisure and learning. Results from the current research being undertaken on Indian tweens suggests that children exposed to multiple socio-cultural environments have a broad outlook to virtual environments and show a great degree of acceptance of multicultural content, besides exhibiting enhanced <b>technological</b> <b>adaptability...</b>|$|E
40|$|In the {{whirlwind}} of deadlines, technical communicators often don’t {{have the time}} to catch up on their professional reading. Most STC members I know have a reading pile that contains at least two copies of Technical Communication and Intercom. Family, home, job, then—maybe—catching up on reading. And where in this list does evaluating new reference materials fall? Maybe nowhere. Given this lack of time, many technical communicators have to rely on recommendations from peers as to what is worth reading and what is valuable to use at work. In addition, many references are expensive, and no one wants to waste money on an unknown quantity. Survey In the course of putting together conference presentations about core skills, Karen Bachmann (president of the Suncoast chapter) and I e-mailed surveys to 200 working technical communicators. We received approximately 40 responses. The people surveyed answered questions about visual and verbal communication, industry specialization, <b>technological</b> <b>adaptability,</b> and other essential skills.

40|$|In this {{increasingly}} convergent {{and digital}} world, {{young people are}} reportedly using new media with high engagement outside school, yet disengaged in those schools where technology access is low or restricted. Such an apparent disconnection is magnified when predictions of their futures are tied to requisites including <b>technological</b> expertise, <b>adaptability</b> to change, innovative capacities and complex problem-solving abilities. Such future oriented capacities challenge traditional views that basic literate and numerate proficiency is sufficient for academic success. They also {{raise questions about the}} sufficiency of digital engagement for developing higher order critical and creative skills. Collectively, these future oriented capacities heighten educational imperatives for improving the quality of young people 2 ̆ 7 s learning outcomes in this rapidly changing online world. This article addresses these issues. It draws on diverse literature sources and an Australian research study (2003 - 2008) into secondary students 2 ̆ 7 curricular digital literacies (Appendix A) to present conceptual advances in understandings about how to recognise, talk about and value signs of quality learning in student-created multimodal products.

This paper provides microfoundations {{to such an}} argument, and revisits the impacts of worker heterogeneity and risk aversion. In our model, firms and workers are located on a knowledge space. Education widens {{the measure of the}} knowledge subset that the worker embodies, while technological complexity expands the measure of the knowledge subset that is required to operate on the job. We find uncertainty with regard to the type of the future partner motivates schooling, while it inhibits technological complexity. When workers differ in scholastic ability, the welfare of a given group increases with the proportion of workers of this group. Finally, risk aversion motivates a precautionary demand for education, which in turn creates income risk through firms' technological choices.

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{a case study}} of collaborative e-learning, in which <b>technological</b> and human <b>adaptability</b> was fostered in a community of practice (CoP). The chapter reflects {{on the use of the}} extended metaphor of the camel in the JISC-funded eLIDA CAMEL and JISC infoNet CAMEL projects. Technological and social insights were gained through this use of the camel metaphorical model in a designed community of practice. A series of nomadic journeys held in oases provided by partners enabled honest exchanges amongst a community of ‘CAMEL’ practitioners, improving e-learning practices. The creation of an intentional e-learning community of practice fostered shared understandings about learning technology innovations. The camel metaphor was formative in stimulating understanding about building communal solutions to sustainability, low-cost innovative engagement and improved cooperation with others. The CAMEL metaphorical model has been validated in numerous other UK e-learning applications from which transnational insights for e-learning development can be drawn...|$|R

Today, the developed and underdeveloped countries share an important role within markets. Underdeveloped countries possess key elements for globalization such as tax-free zones for non local investors, and employment and economic development zones. Due {{to the expansion of}} markets, employees around the world must be adequately trained and updated with the latest in technological advances. This study was designed to evaluate and understand the <b>technological</b> <b>adaptability</b> across the countries of Honduras and the U. S. The researchers used an online survey to acquire the opinion of 102 participants this sample was divided by 46 persons from the US and 56 from Honduras. An online method was used to acquire data, asking the participants to answer anonymously a questionnaire developed by the researcher. This survey contained items of perception of importance, usage and interest towards technology. The results reflect no difference between the perception and usage between both countries. However when it comes perception of importance, age makes a difference...|$|E

40|$|Innovation {{in public}} {{transport}} {{is not always}} a matter of technological advancement. Exemplified by recent Metro Cable systems in Latin America, aligning technological characteristics of a system to the spatial conditions of context can lead to important innovations - in this case: a transport mode originally developed for ski resorts connects the barrios into the urban transport system. As a re-interpretation of existing technology, it shows how the technological characteristics of transport modes are in favor of, or likewise counterproductive for, the context in which they are applied. Throughout Western Europe, new public transport connections are developed to link the peri-urban landscape by public transport. Although well-connected by car, these regions are often isolated in terms of public transport. Classic transport modes from 19 th and 20 th century, such as tram, train and bus have become unfit to provide efficient service in the sprawled city. New public transport projects aim to overcome this mismatch by re-thinking the 'classic' modes, adapting technology to create synergies with contextual characteristics. The contribution critically analyzes, through a number of international projects, how technological characteristics of public transport systems have been chosen to complement their context, in terms of infrastructure, land occupation, development patterns, network integration, density of stops, and location of centralities. This has resulted in a strategy of customization, leading to strong hybridization in public transport concepts, thus blurring the distinction between train, bus and tram. These tailor-made systems show that innovation in public transport is not only about technological advancement, but equally about <b>technological</b> <b>adaptability.</b> status: publishe...|$|E
