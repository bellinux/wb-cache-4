The break-through in identification of the specific activator was only possible due to recent success in a seemingly remote field: the elucidation of the reaction steps of the newly discovered 2 -C-methyl-D-erythritol- 4 -phosphate (MEP) pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis that is utilised by many pathogenic bacteria. Unexpectedly, the intermediate of the MEP pathway, (E) - 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl-but- 2 -enyl-pyrophosphate) (HMB-PP), turned out to be by far the most potent Vγ 9 /Vδ 2 <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>activator</b> known, with an EC 50 of 0. 1 nM...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{transcription}} factor NF-κB regulates genes participating in immune and inflammatory responses. In T lymphocytes, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytosol by the inhibitor IκB-α and released after serine phosphorylation of IκB-α that regulates its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. We report an alternative mechanism of NF-κB activation. Stimulation of Jurkat T cells with the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor and <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>activator</b> pervanadate led to NF-κB activation through tyrosine phosphorylation but not degradation of IκB-α. Pervanadate-induced IκB-α phosphorylation and NF-κB activation required {{expression of the}} T cell tyrosine kinase p 56 lck. Reoxygenation of hypoxic cells appeared as a physiological effector of IκB-α tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IκB-α represents a proteolysis-independent mechanism of NF-κB activation that directly couples NF-κB to cellular tyrosine kinase...|$|E

In this report, we studied the expression {{and function of}} Fas in various subpopulations of mouse thymocytes. Abundant expression of Fas was detected on CD 4 +CD 8 + double positive as well as CD 4 § or CD 8 + single positive thymocytes in wildtype mice. Little or low levels of Fas were expressed in CD 4 -CD 8 - double negative thymocytes except for the CD 4 -CD 8 -CD 3 § phenotype, which expresses Fas as abundantly as double positive or single positive subsets. On the other hand, no Fas expression was detected in any population of thymocytes from Ipr mice. When the wild-type thymocytes were treated with the agonistic anti-Fas antibody, double positive cells from the wild-type mice were selectively killed by apoptosis, whereas, the single positive cells were resistant to its cytolytic activity despite their abundant expression of Fas. Unlike the apoptosis of thymocytes induced by glucocorticoid or <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>activator,</b> the Fas-induced apoptosis of thymocytes was enhanced by metabolic inhibitors such as cycloheximide. Furthermore, intraperitoneal administration of the anti-Fas antibody into mice caused rapid apoptosis of thymocytes in vivo. T lymphocytes respond {{to a wide variety}} of foreig...|$|E

Here, we show that enterotoxin superantigen activation can be transmitted to TCR-CD 3 complexes that did not interact with their ligand. Indeed, by studying cells expressing two distinct TCRs, we found that enterotoxin superantigens induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TCRzeta subunits, the recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein tyrosine kinase ZAP- 70, and an increase in protein tyrosine kinase activity of both directly stimulated and unstimulated TCR-CD 3 complexes. As the involvement of unstimulated TCR-CD 3 complexes in signal transduction would increase the number of signaling molecules and, therefore, the efficiency of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> activation, these data provide a novel explanation for the ability of enterotoxin superantigens to potently activate T lymphocytes...|$|R

40|$|NK T {{cells are}} a unique subset of T cells that {{recognize}} lipid antigens presented by CD 1 d. After activation, NK T cells promptly produce {{large amounts of}} cytokines, which may modulate the upcoming immune responses. Previous studies have documented an association between decreased numbers of NK T cells and the progression of some autoimmune diseases, suggesting that NK T cells may control the development of autoimmune diseases. To investigate the role of NK T cells in autoimmune diabetes, we crossed CD 1 knockout (CD 1 KO) mutation onto the nonobese diabetic (NOD) genetic background. We found that male CD 1 KO NOD mice exhibited significantly higher incidence and earlier onset of diabetes compared with the heterozygous controls. The diabetic frequencies in female mice showed a similar pattern; however, the differences were less profound between female CD 1 KO and control mice. Early treatment of NOD mice with �-galactosylceramide, a potent NK <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>activator,</b> reduced the severity of autoimmune diabetes in a CD 1 -dependent manner.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the tumour-promoting agent TPA (12 - 0 -tetra-dodecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate) on the {{proliferation}} and Ig secretion response of blood and tonsil lymphocytes was investigated and {{compared to that of}} the T-cell-dependent polyclonal activators pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and group A streptococcal cell membranes (A-ScM) or the T-cell-independent B cell mitogen Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) and a T-cell-independent B cell activator Klebsiella pneumoniae (Klebs M). In blood mononuclear cells (MNC), a rather weak, monocyte-dependent DNA synthetic response was observed after exposure to TPA, in comparison to PWM, A-ScM or SAC. Whereas highly purified B cells did not respond to TPA, purified T cells proliferated to a similar degree as unseparated MNC; moreover, the addition of T to B lymphocytes enhanced proliferation rates proportionally to the number of T cells added. This suggests that TPA acts as a polyclonal <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>activator</b> (PTA) for human blood and tonsil cells. Similarly, TPA induced only small amounts of Ig secretion in blood and in tonsil MNC, as determined by an ELISA assay, and no significant Ig secretion in highly purified B cells. The rather weak B cell differentiation response was not due to a monocyte suppressor effect, since partially monocyte-depleted MNC or B cells responded similarly to the non-depleted cells. Thus, TPA cannot be considered as an alternative to other B cells stimulators, both with regard to DNA synthesis and Ig secretion...|$|E

40|$|Previously, {{we found}} that hypoxia can deeply affect the {{production}} of cytokines in human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC). Here, we demonstrated that the cycle progression of hypoxic PBMC, cultured in the presence or not of a specific <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>activator</b> such as phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), was delayed when compared with aerobic cultures. This delay {{was accompanied by a}} decrease of the expression of specific cyclins associated to cell cycle progression phases. Ribonuclease Protection Assay (RPA) studies reveal a decrease in the expression of cyclin A and B in PHA-stimulated PBMC kept for 40 hr under hypoxic condition (2 % O(2)), when compared with aerobic cultures (20 % O(2)). In concomitance, a decrease of cyclin D 2 expression was present after 16 hr of hypoxic treatment. However, the decrease was transient and disappeared after 40 hr of hypoxic treatment. Furthermore, cyclin C expression was not affected by hypoxia. Hypoxia-induced cyclin modulation was accompanied by an increased synthesis of interleukin (IL) - 2 and IL- 4, analyzed by ELISA. By evaluating these results, it appears that hypoxia induces a growth suppressive state in mitogen-activated PBMC by inhibiting the synthesis of mitotic cyclins A and B. However hypoxic PBMC maintain their viability and capability of producing stimulatory cytokines, after mitogen treatment. This should be important in local hypoxia, usually associated with necrotic areas, in inflammation, and infections, where T lymphocyte capability of producing stimulatory cytokines is desirable...|$|E

This study aimed at investigating whether the elevated serum IgE levels reflect {{a shift in the}} balance between CD 4 + T helper 1 (Th 1) and T helper 2 (Th 2) cells in individuals naturally exposed to the P. falciparum parasite. To investigate the role of Th 1 and Th 2 cells in the human P. falciparum system we used the ELISPOT assay to determine the ratio of IFN-γ- and IL- 4 -producing cells after specific antigen or mitogen activation in vitro. The donors were individuals who had acquired immunity through natural exposure to the parasite. In response to the specific malaria antigens, very few IL- 4 -producing cells were seen. However, in the response of individual donors to the polyclonal <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>activator,</b> leucoagglutinin (La), the anti-malarial IgE levels in plasma were correlated with an increased ratio of IL- 4 /IFN-γ producing cells. Thus, donors with ratios of IL- 4 /IFN-γ > 1 exhibited mean plasma anti-malarial IgE levels significantly greater than those with ratios < 1. In individuals not living in P. falciparum-endemic areas the ratio of IL- 4 /IFN-γ was always < 1. Taken together, our data suggest a shift in the balance between Th 1 and Th 2 cells in naturally P. falciparum-primed individuals, associated with elevated anti-P. falciparum plasma IgE levels. The role and biological significance of IgE (Th 2 -type immune response) for protection against P. falciparum and/or pathogenesis of malaria require further study...|$|E

JAM-C is expressed highly on the surface of endothelial cells and platelets, whereas expression in T lymphocytes is not well studied. To investigate the specific gene regulation of JAM-C in T lymphocytes, we determined JAM-C expression in quiescent and activated human T cells. Treatment with the polyclonal <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>activator</b> PHA increased surface and total JAM-C expression in T cells time- and dose-dependently, as determined by flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis. In contrast, no up-regulation of JAM-A in activated T cells was detectable. The highest level of JAM-C up-regulation by PHA was observed in CD 3 +forkhead box P 3 + and CD 4 +CD 25 high T cells. Moreover, TCR activation with combined anti-CD 3 and anti-CD 28 stimulation induced JAM-C expression in T cells. JAM-C induction occurred at the mRNA level, suggesting a transcriptional regulatory mechanism of JAM-C expression. Accordingly, we studied the regulation of the human JAM-C gene promoter in transiently transfected T cells. Luciferase activity of a JAM-C promoter gene construct with three potential consensus sites for the transcription factor NFAT was induced markedly in activated T cells. Finally, pretreatment with two pharmacological inhibitors of calcineurin, cyclosporin A, and FK- 506, but not with MAPK inhibitors, blocked JAM-C induction in activated T cells. In summary, JAM-C is up-regulated in activated human T lymphocytes via a transcriptional mechanism, suggesting a potential role of JAM-C in T cell functions...|$|E

This model employs the WE 17 / 10 cell line, which loses expression of its <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor/CD 3 (TCR/CD 3) {{after several months}} of productive infection. We have used this model to analyze the synthesis and posttranslational modification of viral and cellular proteins after HIV- 1 infection and to determine the relationship of these changes to TCR/CD 3 expression. Mainly we observe positive changes in protein expression after infection. A phosphoprotein, referred to as WH: 1, appears in infected cells that still express their TCR/CD 3 complex, and its persistence {{is linked to the}} presence of the complex.

For example, the distribution of Toll-like receptors {{is similar to that of}} humans, in contrast to that of mice. Here we demonstrate that both populations endocytose foreign material. Following lipopolysaccharide stimulation, CD 80 / 86 and chemokine receptor (CCR) 7 expression was increased in both populations as was the expression of the chemokine ligands (CCL) - 2, CCL- 4, CCL- 20 and CXCL- 2. Although basal and post-stimulation protein concentrations of interleukins 6 and 8 and tumour necrosis factor-α were higher in MoDCs, protein concentrations showed a higher fold increase in BDCs. Antigen-specific proliferation of autologous <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> was induced by MoDCs and BDCs. Interestingly, while MoDCs induced stronger proliferation in naive <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> no difference in proliferation was observed when primed <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> were studied.

Approximately 2 % of circulating <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are naturally occurring Tregs (nTregs). Conventional Ag stimulation of naive FOXP 3 (-) <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> induces Ag-specific Tregs. Polyclonal <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> activation has been shown to produce non-Ag-specific Tregs. Because superantigens are unique among microbial virulence factors in their ability to trigger polyclonal <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> activation, we wanted to determine whether superantigen stimulation of <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> could induce non-Ag-specific Tregs. We assessed the effect of superantigen stimulation of human <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> on activation, regulatory markers, and cytokine production by flow cytometry and <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> suppression assays. Stimulation of PBMCs with staphylococcal exotoxin A and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A and K/L resulted in dose-dependent FOXP 3 expression.

The frequencies of cells capable of extensive proliferation under these culture conditions were 0. 52 - 0. 73, 0. 98 - 1. 11, and less than 0. 02 in peripheral blood mononuclear, E-rosette-positive, and E-rosette-negative cell populations, respectively. The clonogenic potential of virtually all T cells was confirmed in experiments using single cells isolated by micromanipulation. Clone size ranged between 5 and 30 X 10 (4) cells on day 14 of culture. The same microculture system was used to determine the precursor frequency of all cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL-P). As assessed by a lectin-dependent 51 Cr release assay, the CTL-P frequency in purified T cell populations ranged between 0. 30 and 0. 34. In comparison, the precursor frequency of T cells capable of lysing K 562 target cells was ranging between 0. 14 and 0. 16. Parallel analysis of individual clonal cultures for both lytic activities showed that 50 % of the clones exhibiting lectin-dependent lysis were also active against K 562 target cells. All of the proliferating clones expressed HLA-DR antigens, although to a varying degree as assessed by flow cytofluorometry.

40|$|Nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) is a stress-activated {{transcription}} factor that induces {{a variety of}} cytoprotective genes. Nrf 2 also mediates immunosuppressive effects in multiple inflammatory models. Upon activation, Nrf 2 dissociates from its repressor protein, Keap 1, and translocates to the nucleus where it induces Nrf 2 target genes. The Nrf 2 -Keap 1 interaction is disrupted by the environmental toxicant and chemotherapeutic agent arsenic trioxide (ATO). The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine the effects of ATO on early events of T cell activation and the role of Nrf 2 in those effects. The Nrf 2 target genes Hmox- 1, Nqo- 1, and Gclc were all upregulated by ATO (1 - 2 μM) in splenocytes derived from wild-type, but not Nrf 2 -null, mice, suggesting that Nrf 2 is activated by ATO in splenocytes. ATO also inhibited IFNγ, IL- 2, and GM-CSF mRNA and protein production in wild-type splenocytes activated with the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>activator,</b> anti-CD 3 /anti-CD 28. However, ATO also decreased production of these cytokines in activated splenocytes from Nrf 2 -null mice, suggesting the inhibition is independent of Nrf 2. Interestingly, ATO inhibited TNFα protein secretion, but not mRNA expression, in activated splenocytes suggesting the inhibition is due to post-transcriptional modification. In addition, c-Fos DNA binding was significantly diminished by ATO in wild-type and Nrf 2 -null splenocytes activated with anti-CD 3 /anti-CD 28, consistent with the observed inhibition of cytokine production by ATO. Collectively, this study suggests that although ATO activates Nrf 2 in splenocytes, inhibition of early T cell cytokine production by ATO occurs independently of Nrf 2 and may instead be due to impaired AP- 1 DNA binding...|$|E

Current approaches to reactivate the virus have been limited by toxicity, lack of an orally available therapy, and limited responses in primary CD 4 + T cells and in clinical trials. The PKC agonist ingenol, purified from Euphorbia plants, is a potent <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>activator</b> and reactivates latent HIV. Euphorbia kansui itself {{has been used for}} centuries in traditional Chinese medicine to treat ascites, fluid retention, and cancer. We demonstrate that an extract of this plant, Euphorbia kansui, is capable of recapitulating T cell activation induced by the purified ingenol. Indeed, Euphorbia kansui induced expression of the early T cell activation marker CD 69 and P-TEFb in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, Euphorbia kansui reactivated latent HIV in a CD 4 + T cell model of latency and in HIV+ HAART suppressed PBMC. When combined with the other latency reversing agents, the effective dose of Euphorbia kansui required to reactive HIV was reduced 10 -fold and resulted in synergistic reactivation of latent HIV. We conclude that Euphorbia Euphorbia kansui reactivates latent HIV and activates CD 4 + T cells. When used in combination with a latency reversing agent, the effective dose of Euphorbia kansui is reduced; which suggests its application as a combination strategy to reactivate latent HIV while limiting the toxicity due to global T cell activation. As a natural product, which has been used in traditional medicine for thousands of years, Euphorbia kansui is attractive as a potential treatment strategy, particularly in resource poor countries with limited treatment options.

With the exception of IL 2 and IL 7, the cytokines studied had no proliferative effect on these cells. Whereas IL 2 had only a low proliferative capacity (two- to threefold increase) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, recombinant IL 7 constantly induced a very significant (3 - 40 -fold increase) proliferative response, and was used successfully to generate cell lines in three out of eight cases. Growth of Sézary cell lines was shown to be strictly dependent on IL 7, and after 2 - 5 wk of culture presented a switch to a homogeneous phenotype CD 3 + 4 + 8 - 7 - (except for one line that remained CD 7 +), with a typical morphology of Sézary cells.

Expression of IL- 13 also perturbed the development of thymocytes. Although thymocyte development was normal up to 4 wk of age, thymocyte number decreased dramatically thereafter, reaching 10 % of normal by 10 wk, and despite normal size and appearance, histological examination demonstrated that transgenic thymi contained only small foci of thymocytes.

The first step toward a peptide vaccine is epitope mapping of different proteins {{according to the most}} frequent HLA types in a population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Six Leishmania (L.) major-related candidate antigens (CPB,CPC,LmsTI- 1,TSA,LeIF and LPG- 3) were screened for potential CD 8 (+) T cell activating 9 -mer epitopes presented by HLA-A* 0201 (the most frequent HLA-A allele). Online software including SYFPEITHI, BIMAS, EpiJen, Rankpep, nHLApred, NetCTL and Multipred were used. Peptides were selected only if predicted by almost all programs, according to their predictive scores. Pan-A 2 presentation of selected peptides was confirmed by NetMHCPan 1. 1. Selected peptides were pooled in four peptide groups and the immunogenicity was evaluated by in vitro stimulation and intracellular cytokine assay of PBMCs from HLA-A 2 (+) individuals recovered from L. major. HLA-A 2 (-) individuals recovered from L. major and HLA-A 2 (+) healthy donors were included as control groups. Individual response of HLA-A 2 (+) recovered volunteers as percent of CD 8 (+) /IFN-γ(+) T cells after in vitro stimulation against peptide pools II and IV was notably higher than that of HLA-A 2 (-) recovered individuals. Based on cutoff scores calculated from the response of HLA-A 2 (-) recovered individuals, 31. 6 % and 13. 3 % of HLA-A 2 (+) recovered persons responded above cutoff in pools II and IV, respectively. ELISpot and ELISA results confirmed flow cytometry analysis. The response of HLA-A 2 (-) recovered individuals against peptide pools I and III was detected similar and even higher than HLA-A 2 (+) recovered individuals. CONCLUSION: Using in silico prediction we demonstrated specific response to LmsTI- 1 (pool II) and LPG- 3 - (pool IV) related peptides specifically presented in HLA-A* 0201 context. This is among the very few reports mapping L. major epitopes for human HLA types. Studies like this will speed up polytope vaccine idea towards leishmaniasis...|$|E
40|$|The primary aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} if T cells isolated from systemic lupus erythematosus subjects were {{able to respond to}} purified human recombinant Ro 60 after it has been modified by reactive oxygen species. Initial work focused on purification of soluble recombinant Ro 60 after overexpression in E. coli. Ro 60 was then exposed to reactive oxygen species via ultraviolet B irradiation and metal catalyzed oxidation and immunochemical techniques were applied to detect aggregation, fragmentation and carbonyl formation as markers of protein oxidation. None of these markers were induced by ultraviolet B irradiation but metal catalyzed oxidation induced carbonyl formation on a high molecular weight aggregate of Ro 60. Free radical scavengers and metal ion chelators suggested the mechanism of oxidation to be a 'caged reaction'.;A method was established to measure T cell activation analysing viable interferon gamma secreting and interleukin- 4 secreting leukocytes by flow cytometry using a non-specific <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>activator</b> as a positive control. This was used to investigate T cell activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from systemic lupus erythematosus subjects after stimulation in vitro with Ro 60 that had been exposed to reactive oxygen species. In addition cells undergoing apoptotic and necrotic cell death were also detected by flow cytometry after staining with annexin V and propidium iodide. The data were compared to that from age- and sex-matched healthy controls. There was no significant difference increase or decrease in T cell activation or the level of cell death between the two groups after stimulation with reactive oxygen species modified Ro 60. The data represent the highly individual response of subject's immune cells to antigen stimulation. The reactive oxygen species modified Ro 60 used in these investigations represented only a model system to test the hypothesis of reactive oxygen species modification to autoantigen as an initiating factor in autoimmunity.;The methodology established may be applied to other autoantigens in systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune conditions to test a whole spectrum of reactive oxygen species modifications to proteins in addition to other posttranslational modifications which may be involved in the initiation of autoantigen as non 'self'...|$|E
40|$|Background HLA-DQ alleles are {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity reactions, with HLA-DQ 8 associated with several human autoimmune disorders. Limited success has been achieved using sequence-based computational techniques for predicting HLA-DQ 8 -restricted <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> epitopes while accuracy and efficiency of recently developed structure-based models need to be improved. Results We describe a combined structure-based prediction approach for DQ 8 -restricted <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> epitope prediction using a recently developed fast and accurate docking protocol, pDOCK, and molecular surface electrostatic potential (MSEP) -based clustering of pMHC binding interfaces. The prediction model was rigorously trained, tested and validated using experimentally verified DQ 8 binding and non-binding peptides. High prediction accuracy (average area under the ROC curve, average AROC> 0. 94) is validated against experimental data. Our model also predicts all binding registers correctly and known <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>activators</b> with 77 % accuracy. We also studied the patterns of DQ 8 -binding peptides and reassure the existence of epitopes not conforming to binding motifs. Conclusions We have developed a model that can be successfully applied as a generic protocol for easy in silico identification of potential immunogenic <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> epitopes. The current model is therefore applicable for screening vaccine candidates irrespective of sequence motifs. We have also illustrated efficient discrimination of different categories of binders from non-binders as well as different categories of pMHC agonists from non-agonists, while accurately predicting the binding registers of DQ 8 -restricted peptides. This combined approach provides a set of sensitive and specific computational tools to facilitate high-throughput screening of peptides for immunotherapeutic applications such as controlling allergic and autoimmune responses. 9 page(s...|$|R

In this study, we compared the effect of two S. aureus strains on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) development. C 57 BL/ 6 female mice were infected with S. aureus ATCC 51650, which produces toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST- 1 +) or S. aureus ATCC 43300, which does not produce toxins (TOX-). Three days later, the animals were subjected to EAE induction by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). The weight variation, disease incidence and clinical score were recorded daily. Cytokines and Foxp 3 + regulatory <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in the brain were evaluated during the acute disease phase. Cytokines and Foxp 3 + regulatory <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in the spleen and histopathological analysis of the CNS were assessed during the chronic stage. Results: Previous infection with both strains similarly decreased the clinical score; however, only the TSST- 1 + strain clearly diminished inflammation in the CNS. The infections also modulated cytokine production in the spleen and CNS. Reduced production of IL- 5 and IL- 10 was detected in MOG-stimulated spleen cultures in the TOX- and TSST- 1 + infected groups, respectively. In S. aureus stimulated cultures, there was an increased production of IFN-gamma and IL- 10 in both infected groups and an increased level of IL- 5 in the TSST- 1 + group. CNS infiltrating cell cultures from previously infected mice produced less IL- 17 in response to MOG and more IFN-gamma in response to S. aureus stimulation. Conclusions: These results indicated that both strains attenuated clinical EAE manifestations, but only TSST- 1 clearly decreased CNS inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Tick {{modulation}} of host defenses facilitates both blood {{feeding and}} pathogen transmission. Several tick species deviate host <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses toward a Th 2 cytokine profile. The majority {{of studies of}} modulation of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> cytokine expression by ticks were performed with lymphocytes from infested mice stimulated in vitro with polyclonal <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>activators.</b> Those reports did not examine tick modulation of antigen specific responses. We report use of a transgenic <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor (TCR) adoptive transfer model reactive with influenza hemagglutinin peptide (110 - 120) to examine CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> intracellular cytokine responses during infestation with the metastriate tick, Dermacentor andersoni, or exposure to salivary gland extracts. Results Infestation with pathogen-free D. andersoni nymphs or administration of an intradermal injection of female or male tick salivary gland extract induced significant increases of IL- 4 transcripts in skin and draining lymph nodes of BALB/c mice as measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, IL- 10 transcripts were significantly increased in skin while IL- 2 and IFN-γ transcripts were not significantly changed by tick feeding or intradermal injection of salivary gland proteins, suggesting a superimposed Th 2 response. Infestation induced TCR transgenic CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> to divide more frequently as measured by CFSE dilution, but more notably these CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> also gained the capacity to express IL- 4. Intracellular levels of IL- 4 were significantly increased. A second infestation administered 14 days after a primary exposure to ticks resulted in partially reduced CFSE dilution with no change in IL- 4 expression when compared to one exposure to ticks. Intradermal inoculation of salivary gland extracts from {{both male and female}} ticks also induced IL- 4 expression. Conclusion This is the first report of the influence of a metastriate tick on the cytokine profile of antigen specific CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> Blood feeding by D. andersoni pathogen-free nymphs or intradermal injection of salivary gland extracts programs influenza hemagglutinin influenza peptide specific TCR transgenic CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> to express IL- 4. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Eradication of HIV- 1 from an {{infected}} individual cannot {{be achieved by}} current drug regimens. Viral reservoirs established early during the infection remain unaffected by anti-retroviral therapy {{and are able to}} replenish systemic infection upon interruption of the treatment. Therapeutic targeting of viral latency will require {{a better understanding of the}} basic mechanisms underlying the establishment and long-term maintenance of HIV- 1 in resting memory CD 4 <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> the most prominent reservoir of transcriptional silent provirus. However, the molecular mechanisms that permit long-term transcriptional control of proviral gene expression in these cells are still not well understood. Exploring the molecular details of viral latency will provide new insights for eventual future therapeutics that aim at viral eradication. Results We set out to develop a new in vitro HIV- 1 latency model system using the doxycycline (dox) -inducible HIV-rtTA variant. Stable cell clones were generated with a silent HIV- 1 provirus, which can subsequently be activated by dox-addition. Surprisingly, only a minority of the cells was able to induce viral gene expression and a spreading infection, eventhough these experiments were performed with the actively dividing SupT 1 <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> line. These latent proviruses are responsive to TNFα treatment and alteration of the DNA methylation status with 5 -Azacytidine or genistein, but not responsive to the regular <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>activators</b> PMA and IL 2. Follow-up experiments in several <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> lines and with wild-type HIV- 1 support these findings. Conclusion We describe the development of a new in vitro model for HIV- 1 latency and discuss the advantages of this system. The data suggest that HIV- 1 proviral latency is not restricted to resting <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> but rather an intrinsic property of the virus. </p...|$|R

This study was undertaken to evaluate overall immunologic spectrum of the Vietnam War Korean veterans exposed to Agent Orange contaminated with TCDD. Quantity of red blood cells, hemoglobin and hematocrit in the veterans suffered from chronic diseases associated with Agent Orange exposure (Veteranspatient group) were decreased in comparison {{with those of the}} veterans without the diseases and the age-matched healthy controls, but no differences in leukocyte populations. Plasma IgG levels were lowered in the veterans than the controls, owing to significant decrease in the IgG 1 levels. Increase in the IgE levels was observed in the plasma from the veterans. Alteration of T cell-mediated immunity was also resulted from activation of peripheral blood mononuclear <b>cells</b> with polyclonal <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>activators.</b> Production of IFNγ, a major cytokine mediating host resistance against infection or tumoregenesis, was lowered in the veterans-patient group.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are the {{directors}} of the immune system, capable of inducing tumour antigen-specific T- and B-cell responses. As such, they are currently applied in clinical studies in cancer patients. Early small clinical trials showed promising results, with frequent induction of anti-cancer immune reactivity and clinical responses. In recent years, additional trials have been carried out in melanoma patients, and although immunological responses are often reported, objective clinical responses remain anecdotal with objective response rates not exceeding 5 - 10 %. Thus, DC vaccination research has now entered a stage in between 'proof of principle' and 'proof of efficacy' trials. Crucial questions to answer at this moment are why the clinical responses remain scarce {{and what can be done}} to improve the efficacy of vaccination. The answers to these questions probably lie in the preparation and administration of the DC vaccines. Predominantly, cytokine-matured DC are used in clinical studies, while from preclinical studies it is evident that DC that are activated by pathogen-associated molecules are much more potent <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>activators.</b> For sake of easy accessibility monocyte-derived DC are often used, but are these cells also the most potent type of DC? Other yet unsettled issues include the optimal antigen-loading strategy and route of administration. In addition, trials are needed to investigate the value of manipulating tolerizing mechanisms, such as depletion of regulatory <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> or blockade of the inhibitory <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> molecule CTLA- 4. These issues need to be addressed in well-designed comparative clinical studies with biological endpoints in order to determine the optimal vaccine characteristics. DC vaccination can then be put to the ultimate test of randomized clinical trials. Here, we review the immunobiology of DC with emphasis on the different aspects that are most relevant for the induction of anti-tumour responses in vivo. The different variables in preparing and administering DC vaccines are discussed in this context and the immunological and clinical results of studies with DC vaccines in melanoma patients are summarize...|$|R

Co-culture experiments demonstrated that cord blood <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> would inhibit immunoglobulin production by adult cells stimulated with PWM, but not with EBV.

40|$|Using {{a limited}} {{dilution}} analysis {{it was found}} that CsA impairs the <b>T</b> helper <b>cell</b> function in an in vitro MLC assay. As a consequence no proliferation (i. e., expansion) of cytolytic <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> (CTL) occurred, but CTL precursor cells remained intact. This suppression of CTL generation can be overcome by adding exogenous IL- 2 into the culture. When mice were treated with CsA in vivo, {{it was found that}} a low dose of CsA treatment only <b>T</b> helper <b>cell</b> function is impaired; however, when the dose was increased, the CTL precursor cells are eliminated in an antigen nonspecific manner. The lymphokine production of spleen cells from CsA treated animals were quantified. Data show that the production of Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), a <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> growth factor produced by <b>T</b> helper <b>cells,</b> was significantly decreased; but, the production of Interleukin- 1 (IL- 1), a <b>T</b> helper <b>cell</b> <b>activator</b> produced by macrophages, was not affected. These data confirm that CsA impairs <b>T</b> helper <b>cell</b> function. When the effect of CsA on cultured tumor cells was evaluated, it was found that CsA is cytostatic to T-cell tumors, regardless of whether they express the IL- 2 receptors; however, for tumor cells which express the IL- 2 receptor, their suppression by CsA can be overcome by the presence of IL- 2 in the culture medium. On the other hand, for tumor cells expressing no IL- 2 receptor, the exogenous IL- 2 cannot overcome the CsA-induced suppression. These findings lead to the conclusion that CsA-induced suppression may not be a result of direct action on IL- 2 receptors. For nonmalignant <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> clones, regardless of their classification and function, their alloantigen-driven but not IL- 2 -driven proliferation was found to be suppressed by CsA. However, the cytolysis reaction of both class I and class II cytolytic <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> was not affected by CsA.
