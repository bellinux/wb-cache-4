Often and often as I looked at you through that grating have I thought that it would be to me the {{greatest}} joy on earth if I could <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> my arms and tell you that I loved you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Very sorry, sir. Three gentlemen {{sleeping}} on the billiard-table already, and two in the coffee-room. Can’t possibly <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> to-night.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{brings you}} here to-night?' he began. 'I don't want, God knows, to seem unfriendly; but I cannot <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in,</b> Nicholson; I cannot do it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He! Thou'lt {{never have}} the folly! The old hound is half blind and past use. No man will <b>take</b> <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> with him after thee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Weel I wot," [...] resumed Meiklewham, [...] "he <b>took</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> {{about the}} saumon fish, {{and some other}} wager ye lost to him this very day." ...|$|R
60|$|Mufti. Sacrilege, you mean, sirrah,--and damning {{shall be}} the least part of your punishment: I have <b>taken</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the manner, and will have the law upon you.|$|R
6000|$|... "But surely I was to <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> to supper?" [...] {{the young}} officer protested, good-humouredly. [...] "Don't {{tell me that}} you are going to cut that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{must have}} been fun. But--" [...] She shook a finger at him. [...] "--I can't have you getting pickled! I'll have to <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> hand!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{brings you}} here to-night?" [...] he began. [...] "I don't want, God knows, to seem unfriendly; but I cannot <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in,</b> Nicholson; I cannot do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want {{none of your}} impudence," [...] {{cried the}} broker. [...] "You were not {{as much of a}} man as this boy when I <b>took</b> <b>you</b> <b>in,</b> eight years ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is as may be; now I'm countin' {{that when}} your admiral gets as far {{up the river}} as Nottingham, if he ever does, you'll be somewhere else, for we've <b>taken</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> charge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And by my troth, {{he needs}} good country diet and air!" [...] cried Perronel. [...] "Thou hast had none to <b>take</b> care of <b>thee,</b> Ambrose. They have let thee pine and dwine over thy books. I must <b>take</b> <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “There is no {{help for}} it then,” {{returned}} Kalamake, “and I must <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> my confidence, Keola, {{for the lack}} of anyone better. Come here within the house.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{no reason}} why you should do that," [...] he replied. [...] "I can't leave the canoe here, anyway, and I can <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a little lower down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fear not!" [...] {{said the}} good Giant. [...] "Fear not I soon will release him. Let me <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> my hands, {{and do you}} show me where to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don’t {{know nothing}} about your purse," [...] said the other, {{regarding}} him closely with his little bloodshot eyes; [...] "you’re trying to do me out o’my three pounds—me what’s <b>took</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> and ’id you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid he}} didn't show you much sport," [...] Sir Henry observed. [...] "From what Jimmy Dumble's brother told him, {{he seems to}} have <b>taken</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> entirely the wrong direction, and on the wrong tide." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hush! What {{good would}} that do? A boy like <b>you?</b> Unless they <b>took</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> hand {{to make you}} a traitor, and offered you your lands if you would swear {{allegiance}} to King Edward, as he calls himself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You look tired," [...] {{he pressed}} her. [...] "I can <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> {{the machine and}} run you {{anywhere}} you want. It won't be any trouble. I've plenty of time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stop!' he cried, 'whoever you may be, {{and do not}} let a disgraceful impostor <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in.</b> My name is Omar, and let no one {{attempt to}} rob me of it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no {{help for}} it then," [...] {{returned}} Kalamake, [...] "and I must <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> my confidence, Keola, {{for the lack}} of anyone better. Come here within the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{young man}} is givin' it to you straight, Abe," [...] replied Tom Dillon, {{pointing}} to Roger. [...] "And these are his friends--all true blue to the core. These other fellers are first-class swindlers. They <b>took</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> good an' proper." ...|$|R
6000|$|He <b>took</b> <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> his arms, and <b>in</b> pity brought <b>thee</b> home, [...] A blessed day for thee! then whither would'st thou roam? [...] A {{faithful}} nurse thou hast, the dam {{that did}} thee yean [...] Upon the mountain tops no kinder could have been.|$|R
5000|$|Live a life, not {{a resume}} - What you believe is your safest career move {{may be your}} riskiest. What is safe is {{following}} what you believe is your destiny; what is more risky is selling out for money and power that <b>takes</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> another direction.|$|R
6000|$|Here again, by ill luck, Mr. Pynsent {{came up to}} Laura, {{and said}} [...] "I have it in command from Lady Rockminster to ask whether I may <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> to supper?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The officer {{stood and}} {{steadily}} stared at me. 'I declare,' he said, 'you {{do not look}} like a crazy man. At what time did this Water-devil begin to <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> tow?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; they can't do that. They wouldn't <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> at {{the county}} jail, but they might make a prison of Puritan Grange. I don't say they will, but they might try it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He <b>took</b> <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> his arms, and <b>in</b> pity brought <b>thee</b> home: [...] A blessed day for thee! then whither wouldst thou roam? [...] A {{faithful}} nurse thou hast; the dam {{that did}} thee yean [...] Upon the mountain tops no kinder could have been. [...] 40 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sh!" [...] she whispered, suddenly, [...] "methinks I hear footsteps. They {{must not}} find thee here, Norman of Torn, for the King has only this night wrung a promise {{from my father}} to <b>take</b> <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> the morning and hang thee. What shall we do, Norman? Where shall we meet again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>took</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> {{hand when}} <b>you</b> came on board, young un," [...] Bill went on, [...] "and I looks upon you as my chick, and I tell you I feel proud on you. I felt {{sure you would}} turn out a good un, some day, but I didn't look to see it so quick.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd {{better not}} come in here," [...] she said, {{blushing}} slightly; [...] "although I want to <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> {{to some of the}} people. I {{think it will be a}} lesson to them." ...|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE. Not merely to-day, but now. As it happens, my {{carriage}} {{is standing}} idle at your door, and I am to <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> {{it to your}} home--some twenty miles if I remember.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear girl, do {{let us be}} cynical. You haven't {{money and}} you haven't credit. No one would <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>in.</b> It's one of two things: {{go back to your}} stepmother, or--trust to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Suspicion?' {{repeated}} Mrs Gowan. 'Not suspicion, Mr Clennam, Certainty. It is very knowingly done indeed, {{and seems}} to have <b>taken</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>in</b> completely.' She laughed; and again sat tapping her lips with her fan, and tossing her head, as if she added, 'Don't tell me. I know such people will do anything for the honour of such an alliance.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir James {{would have}} thee {{come to the}} tilt-yard this morn; he himself will <b>take</b> <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> hand to try what thou canst do. Thou mayst take the arms upon yonder rack, and use them until {{otherwise}} bidden. Thou seest that the number painted above it on the wall is seventeen; that will be thy number for the nonce." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you make}} those trees you'll strike {{the trail and}} it's pretty well beaten. It will <b>take</b> <b>you</b> {{straight}} <b>in</b> to Leslie's." ...|$|R
