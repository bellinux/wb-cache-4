500|$|Other reviews {{were less}} complimentary. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris wrote, [...] "there are some {{powerful}} and touching moments in 'Sein und Zeit', but others that miss the mark so widely that it hurts <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> this episode might have been." [...] Kenneth Silber from Space.com, although complimentary towards {{the focus on}} Samantha Mulder, was critical of the slowness of the episode, writing, [...] "While the series' reversion to its central theme is much appreciated, this episode unfolds with an unfortunate slowness that does little to satisfy the seven-year itch many X-Files viewers have come to feel in response to monster-of-the-week episodes and phony-baloney mythology cliffhangers." ...|$|E
500|$|Lessing {{said she}} was {{inspired}} to write The Good Terrorist by the IRA bombing of the Harrods department store in London in 1983. She recalled, [...] "the media reported it to sound {{as if it was}} the work of amateurs. I started <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> <b>what</b> kind of amateurs could they be?" [...] and realised [...] "how easy it would be for a kid, not really knowing what he or she was doing, to drift into a terrorist group." [...] Lessing already had Alice in mind as the central character: [...] "I know several people like Alice—this mixture of... maternal caring,... and who can contemplate killing large numbers of people without a moment's bother." [...] She described Alice as [...] "quietly comic" [...] because she is so full of contradictions. She {{said she was}} surprised how some of the characters (other than Jasper, Alice's love interest) developed, such as the pill-popping and fragile Faye, {{who turned out to be}} a [...] "destroyed person".|$|E
500|$|Ivan had {{previously}} been married to a woman and he enjoys flirting with females. One such moment is a flirtation with Jasmine Thomas (Jenna-Louise Coleman); they bond over her liking of the Brontë novels Wuthering Heights and Shirley. When Nicola Blackstock (Nicola Wheeler) confesses her attraction to Ivan, he tells her that it is her brother, Paul that he is interested in and kisses him on the cheek. Brocklebank told Laws that he had known Bose for six years prior to joining the serial and was also living with him. He {{said that it would}} be [...] "embarrassing" [...] if romance developed between their characters because of their friendship. However, the actor did think it was [...] "great" [...] to be given [...] "such a meaty storyline". Brocklebank told a reporter from The People that he dreaded <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> his grandmother would make of the storyline. He said he was interested to receive the reaction from viewers because [...] "it's a subject that hasn't been covered before". The actor later said that he found Ivan's bisexuality [...] "really interesting" [...] because he felt that it had not [...] "really been tackled in soaps before". Brocklebank later spoke of his belief that there was [...] "still a stigma attached to being bisexual" [...] and his hopes that Ivan's storyline would [...] "break some barriers" [...] around the issue.|$|E

500|$|James Berardinelli of ReelViews {{gave the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, and claimed that many of the film's ideas for {{altering}} its familiar storyline [...] "sound better on paper than they turn out in execution." [...] Finding it tedious to view the film's story told multiple times, he wrote that the film [...] "slips into boredom." [...] Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle also gave the film {{two and a half}} stars, and although he praised its [...] "snappy dialogue and fresh characterizations", he considered the film's plot underdeveloped and characters lacking in motivation. Peter Rainer writing for The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a C+ and called it [...] "a moderately enjoyable escapade that isn't quite clever enough for adults and not quite imaginative enough for children." [...] He was not overly critical of the film, but felt that it was a disappointment in comparison to the high standards for computer-animated films set by Pixar. Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News suggested that timelessness is a necessary component of an animated classic, and faulted the film for its attempt to be hip and current. While Ty Burr of The Boston Globe praised the film's vocal performances, he wrote, [...] "Hoodwinked never builds to a level of sustained comic mania... One aches <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> the great Looney Tunes directors could have done with this material." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hopkins was a {{supporter}} of linguistic purism in English. In an 1882 letter to Robert Bridges, Hopkins writes: [...] "It makes one weep <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> English might have been; for {{in spite of all}} that Shakespeare and Milton have done [...] no beauty in a language can make up for want of purity". He took time to learn Old English, which became a major influence on his writing. In the same letter to Bridges he calls Old English [...] "a vastly superior thing to what we have now".|$|E

2500|$|In 1931, Gimbutas {{settled with}} her parents in Kaunas, the {{temporary}} capital of Lithuania, where she continued her studies. After her parents separated that year, she lived {{with her mother and}} brother, Vytautas, in Kaunas. Five years later, her father died suddenly. At her father's deathbed, Gimbutas pledged that she would study to become a scholar: [...] "All of a sudden I had <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> I shall be, what I shall do with my life. I had been so reckless in sports—swimming for miles, skating, bicycle riding. I changed completely and began to read." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Second World War all home internationals were suspended, however, {{during this}} period Ireland played an {{unofficial}} match against a combined services eleven, which was effectively a Great Britain side containing Matt Busby, Stanley Matthews, Tommy Lawton and Stan Mortensen. The game was a high scoring affair with Ireland losing 4–8, with all four Ireland goals coming from the future manager Peter Doherty. The performance of Doherty was such that the match commentator, Maurice Edelston, stated [...] "He was almost a one-man team– and if Ireland had two Dohertys that day, I shudder <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> might have happened".|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, One Life to Live {{executive}} producer Linda Gottlieb hired a fresh-faced 17-year-old Ryan Phillippe {{to play the}} newly created role. Phillippe said he was warned against playing the [...] "risky" [...] role {{at the height of}} the AIDS crisis in the United States. Phillippe said that when he auditioned to play the character, he [...] "had no idea Billy was gay." [...] He initially expressed reservation to pursue the opportunity, telling Entertainment Weekly in 1992, [...] "I thought, 'What is my family going <b>to</b> <b>think?</b> <b>What</b> about my friends?'

2500|$|On the night, Labour's {{candidate}} Judith Tizard {{came within}} 406 votes {{of winning the}} traditionally National-held seat of Remuera; she had been forecast as the winner by initial vote counting. Tizard's near-win fueled Lange's misgivings about the direction his government was taking. He commented, [...] "That election night was a great revelation for me. That was an apprehension on my part that we had actually abandoned our constituency. And it set me <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> on earth have we done that we come within 400 votes of winning the true-blue seat of Remuera. And that struck me as being a dangerous flirtation, and an act of treachery to the people we were born to represent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson, a folksy, honest, and outspoken man, {{sometimes}} {{got into}} trouble because of casual remarks. In January 1957, for example, he referred to enlistees in the National Guard during the Korean War as [...] "draft dodgers". This caused a storm of protest and even brought a rebuke from the president, who said he thought Wilson had made [...] "a very ... unwise statement, without stopping <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> it meant". On another occasion, Wilson jokingly referred to the White House as a [...] "dung hill", generating further controversy. These episodes should not detract from recognition of Wilson's determined efforts to run the Department of Defense efficiently and to maintain the nation's security forces within reasonable budget guidelines.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{there was}} some {{speculation}} that [...] "Living Type" [...] was [...] "a cheesy, angsty love song", Powderfinger's lead singer; Bernard Fanning (who wrote the song) said it was actually about Charles Manson, and the people affected by his cult. [...] Fanning {{said that he was}} unable to control what people thought about the song, and so didn't try, but that [...] "cheesy love song" [...] that it had been dubbed was [...] "not the intention" [...] of the song. In a subsequent interview, Fanning told Juice magazine that people had been asking him if [...] "Living Type" [...] was about menstruation, which he dismissed as being [...] "so stupid". [...] However, he also re-iterated his statement that he was unable to control interpretations of the song, saying that [...] "people have a freedom <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> they like".|$|E

2500|$|An {{aim of the}} Tractatus is {{to reveal}} the {{relationship}} between language and the world: what {{can be said about}} it, and what can only be shown. Wittgenstein argues that language has an underlying logical structure, a structure that provides the limits of what can be said meaningfully. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of philosophy. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable: [...] "What we can say at all can be said clearly," [...] he argues. Anything beyond that—religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical—cannot be discussed. They are not in themselves nonsensical, but any statement about them must be. He wrote in the preface: [...] "The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should {{have to be able to}} think both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> cannot be thought)." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reports of the {{collapse}} of this part of the Union line caused great consternation at Grant's headquarters, leading to an interchange that is widely quoted in Grant biographies. An officer accosted Grant, proclaiming, [...] "General Grant, this is a crisis that cannot be looked upon too seriously. I know Lee's methods well by past experience; he will throw his whole army between us and the Rapidan, and cut us off completely from our communications." [...] Grant seemed to be waiting for such an opportunity and snapped, [...] "Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing about what Lee is going to do. Some of you always seem to think he is suddenly going to turn a double somersault, and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. Go back to your command, and try <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> {{we are going to do}} ourselves, instead of what Lee is going to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{music has}} been noted for its diversity, with Dusted {{saying that he had}} been [...] "defying strict genre classifications since the early nineties, {{swapping}} labels, styles, partners, motifs, and recording techniques as the desire has struck him". He has been recording for most of his life, telling Foxy Digitalis that [...] "I've made music as long as I can remember - ever since I was a child - and recorded the stuff as long as I've had the technology - I began with a cheap cassette player. So, it's strange <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> it'd be like not to make or record music. It seems unnatural!". When reviewing his 1996 CD Festival, Melody Maker described him as [...] "grand-meister of contemporary British improv, spiritual son of Eddie Prevost and Maddy Prior; gentle manipulator of English hymn-notics and religious incantations; protege, challenger and radicaliser of folk, blues, rock, minimalism and improvisation; translator for the sea and the rain and the sky; ambassador to war and peace, to love and anguish".|$|E

2500|$|The British and French fleets {{departed}} from the Bulgarian port of Varna on 5 September 1854, heading towards Kalamita Bay in the Crimea. By the 14th, the troops began to land; within four days the Allied force of 61,400 infantry, 1,200 cavalry and 137 guns, was ashore. Thirty-three miles (~53km) {{to the south of}} the landing zone, beyond the Bulganak, Alma, Katcha and Belbek rivers, lay the Russian naval base and fortress of Sevastopol, the key Allied objective in the Crimea. General Menshikov, aware of the Allied presence, prepared his troops {{on the banks of the}} River Alma in an effort to halt the Franco-British advance, but on 20 September he was soundly defeated in what was the first major battle in the Crimea. News of Menshikov's defeat was met with disbelief by Tsar Nicholas I in St. Petersburg – it seemed it would only be a matter of time before Sevastopol fell. But Allied hesitation, first from the French commander-in-chief, Saint-Arnaud, then by Lord Raglan, allowed the dispirited Russians to escape the battlefield in relative order, allowing Menshikov and his army to reach Sevastopol, reorganise and rebuild their morale. [...] "It is frightful <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> might have happened," [...] wrote Vice-Admiral Kornilov, [...] "had it not been for this cardinal error of the enemy's." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E
