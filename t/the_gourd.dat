5|$|Cucurbita (Latin for gourd) is a genus of {{herbaceous}} vines in <b>the</b> <b>gourd</b> family, Cucurbitaceae, {{also known}} as cucurbits, native to the Andes and Mesoamerica. Five species are grown worldwide for their edible fruit, variously known as squash, pumpkin, or gourd depending on species, variety, and local parlance, and for their seeds. Other kinds of gourd, also called bottle-gourds, are native to Africa and belong to the genus Lagenaria, {{which is in the}} same family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe. These other gourds are used as utensils or vessels, and their young fruits are eaten much like those of Cucurbita species.|$|E
25|$|At pow wows {{where there}} is a large Southern Plains {{community}} in the area, <b>the</b> <b>Gourd</b> Dance is often included {{before the start of the}} pow wow sessions. <b>The</b> <b>gourd</b> dance originated with the Kiowa tribe, whence it spread, and is a society dance for veterans and their families. Unlike other dances, <b>the</b> <b>gourd</b> dance is normally performed with the drum in the center of the dance arena, not on the side.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gourd</b> Dance is a Kiowa dance ceremony. It is {{believed}} that the dance originated with the Kiowa. First it is a man's dance. It is often danced by Warriors/Veterans, although <b>the</b> <b>Gourd</b> Dance has its own unique history. Gourd Dancing may precede the pow-wow {{or it can be}} a separate event, not directly connected with a pow-wow. <b>The</b> <b>Gourd</b> Dance was not only held to honor a warrior, or honor their enemy who they defeated. It honors all Warriors & Veterans. The final song is the Buffalo song.|$|E

25|$|After {{arranging}} the yerba {{along one side}} of <b>the</b> <b>gourd,</b> the mate is carefully tilted back onto its base, minimizing further disturbances of the yerba as it is re-oriented to allow consumption. Some settling is normal, but is not desirable. The angled mound of yerba should remain, with its powdery peak still flat and mostly level with the top of <b>the</b> <b>gourd.</b> A layer of stems along its slope will slide downward and accumulate in the space opposite the yerba (though at least a portion should remain in place).|$|E
25|$|Once the yerba mate has settled, {{the mate}} is {{carefully}} {{brought to a}} near-sideways angle, with the opening tilted just slightly upward of the base. The mate is then shaken very gently with a side-to-side motion. This further settles the yerba mate inside <b>the</b> <b>gourd</b> so that the finest particles move toward the opening and the yerba is layered along one side. The largest stems and other bits create a partition between the empty space {{on one side of}} <b>the</b> <b>gourd</b> and the lopsided pile of yerba on the other.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} <b>gourds</b> worldwide. <b>The</b> main plants referred to as gourds include several species from the Cucurbita genus (mostly native to North America, including <b>the</b> Malabar <b>gourd</b> and turban squash), Crescentia cujete (<b>the</b> tree <b>gourd</b> or calabash tree, native to the American tropics) and Lagenaria siceraria (bottle gourd). Other plants with gourd in their name include <b>the</b> luffa <b>gourd</b> (likely domesticated in Asia), which includes several species from the Luffa genus, as well as <b>the</b> wax <b>gourd,</b> snake gourd, teasel gourd, hedgehog gourd, buffalo gourd/coyote <b>gourd.</b> <b>The</b> bitter melon/balsam apple/balsam pear is also {{sometimes referred to as}} a gourd.|$|R
25|$|Traditionally, natural gourds are used, though wood vessels, bamboo tubes, and gourd-shaped mates, made {{of ceramic}} or metal (stainless steel or even silver) are also common. <b>The</b> <b>gourd</b> is {{traditionally}} {{made out of}} the porongo or cabaça fruit shell. Gourds are commonly decorated with silver, sporting decorative or heraldic designs with floral motifs. Some gourd mates with elaborated silver ornaments and silver bombillas are true pieces of jewelry and very sought after by collectors.|$|E

25|$|During this era, Havasupai {{relations}} with other Native American tribes were generally mixed. Bonds and interactions with the Hopi tribe, whose reservation was in close proximity, were strong, as the two peoples did {{a great deal of}} trading with each other. The Hopi introduced crops such as <b>the</b> <b>gourd</b> and sunflower that would eventually become a staple of the Havasupai diet. Still, the Havasupai were not without enemies as they were consistently at odds with the Yavapai and the Southern Paiute, who would steal and destroy crops planted by the Havasupai.|$|E

50|$|Lagenaria is a genus of gourd-bearing vines in {{the squash}} family (Cucurbitaceae). Lagenaria {{contains}} six species, {{all of which}} are indigenous to tropical Africa. The best-known species, <b>the</b> bottle <b>gourd,</b> L. siceraria, has been domesticated by humans, and has spread beyond Africa. The other species are not cultivated. <b>The</b> <b>gourds</b> of <b>the</b> various species may be harvested young and used as a vegetable. More commonly, <b>the</b> <b>gourds</b> are harvested mature, then dried, and used in making utensils (including musical instruments and containers). Gourds of L. siceraria have been used to store water and other liquids since ancient times. The generic name lagenaria comes from classical Latin lagena meaning bottle or flask, plus Latin suffix -aria.|$|R

The head of all monastics is called Āchārya, while the saintly preceptor of saints is the upādhyāya. The Āchārya has 36 primary attributes (mūla guņa) {{in addition to the}} 28 mentioned above. The monks perform kayotsarga daily, in a rigid and immobile posture, with the arms held stiffly down, knees straight, and toes directed forward. Female monastics in Digambara tradition are known as aryikas. Statistically, there are more Digambara nuns, than there are monks.|$|E
25|$|Each drum has a Lead Singer {{who runs}} {{his or her}} drum and leads the singers while singing. Host drums are {{responsible}} for singing the songs {{at the beginning and}} end of a pow wow session, generally a starting song, the grand entry song, a flag song, and a veterans or victory song to start the pow-wow, and a flag song, retreat song and closing song to end the pow wow. Additionally, if a pow-wow has gourd dancing, the Southern Host Drum is often the drum that sings all <b>the</b> <b>gourd</b> songs, though another drum can perform them. The host drums are often called upon to sing special songs during the pow-wow.|$|E
25|$|The {{preparation}} of mate {{is a simple}} process, consisting of filling a container with yerba, pouring hot, but not boiling, water over the leaves, and drinking with a straw, the bombilla, which acts as a filter so as to draw only the liquid and not the yerba leaves. The method of preparing the mate infusion varies considerably from region to region, and which method yields the finest outcome is debated. However, nearly all methods have some common elements. The beverage is traditionally prepared in a gourd recipient, also called mate or guampa in Spanish and cuia in Portuguese, from which it is drunk. <b>The</b> <b>gourd</b> is nearly filled with yerba, and hot water, typically at , never boiling, is added.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> bottle <b>gourd</b> (lagenaria siceraria) is a domesticated {{species that}} {{originated}} in Africa and was dispersed throughout Asia by 9000 B.C.E. {{and reached the}} Americas by 8000 B.C.E. Morphologically and genetically, the Asian and African bottle gourds are sufficiently different {{that they can be}} designated as two separate subspecies. Morphologically <b>the</b> American <b>gourd</b> resembles <b>the</b> African <b>gourds</b> more than <b>the</b> Asian <b>gourds,</b> which was previously used as support for the theory that the American variety is derived from a wild African gourd that floated across the ocean. However, in 2005 researchers with the Smithsonian Institution were able to use a combination of archeological and genomic data to show that <b>the</b> bottle <b>gourds</b> in <b>the</b> Americas are actually more similar to Asian gourds, which suggests that <b>the</b> American <b>gourds</b> may be derived from Asian gourds that were carried across the Bering land bridge by Paleo-Indians.|$|R

25|$|One Taíno oral {{tradition}} {{explains that the}} Sun and Moon come out of caves. Another story tells of people who once lived in caves and only came out at night, because {{it was believed that}} the Sun would transform them. The Taíno believed they were descended from the union of Deminán Caracaracol and a female turtle. The origin of the oceans is described in the story of a huge flood, which occurred when a father murdered his son (who was about to murder the father). The father put the son's bones into a gourd or calabash. When the bones turned into fish, <b>the</b> <b>gourd</b> broke, and all the water of the world came pouring out.|$|E
25|$|After {{the above}} process, the yerba may be brewed. If the straw is {{inserted}} into dry yerba, the mate {{must first be}} filled once with cool water as above, then be allowed to absorb it completely (which generally takes {{no more than two}} or three minutes). Treating the yerba with cool water before the addition of hot water is essential, as it protects the yerba mate from being scalded and from the chemical breakdown of some of its desirable nutrients. Hot water may then be added by carefully pouring it, as with the cool water before, into the cavity opposite the yerba, until it reaches almost to the top of <b>the</b> <b>gourd</b> when the yerba is fully saturated. Care should be taken to maintain the dryness of the swollen top of the yerba beside the edge of the gourd's opening.|$|E
25|$|It is {{prepared}} by steeping dried leaves of yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis, known in Portuguese as erva-mate) {{in hot water}} and is served with a metal straw from a shared hollow calabash gourd. The straw is called a bombilla in Spanish, a bomba in Portuguese, and a bombija or, more generally, a masassa (straw) in Arabic. The straw is traditionally made of silver. Modern, commercially available straws are typically made of nickel silver, called alpaca; stainless steel, or hollow-stemmed cane. <b>The</b> <b>gourd</b> {{is known as a}} mate or a guampa; while in Brazil, it has the specific name of cuia, or also cabaça (the name for Indigenous-influenced calabash gourds in other regions of Brazil, still used for general food and drink in remote regions). Even if the water is supplied from a modern thermos, the infusion is traditionally drunk from mates or cuias.|$|E

25|$|Drums {{are highly}} {{influential}} in American Indian music. Different tribes have different traditions about their drums {{and how to}} play them. For larger dance or powwow type drums, the basic construction is very similar in most tribes: a wooden frame or a carved and hollowed-out log, with rawhide buckskin or elk skin stretched out across the opening by sinew thongs. Traditionally American Indian drums are large, two to three feet in diameter, and they are played communally by groups of singers who sit around them in a circle. For smaller single-sided hand drums, a thinner frame or shell is used, and a rawhide surface is strung onto only one side, with lacing across the other. Other types include two basic styles of water drums: the Iroquois type and the Yaqui type. The Iroquois water drum is a small cup-shaped wooden vessel, with water inside it, and a moistened tanned hide stretched across the top opening; the wetness and tightness of the tanned hide produce changes in pitch as the water drum is played over time. The Yaqui type of water drum is actually a half gourd, large in size, that floats in a tub of water like a bubble on the surface; the outer round surface of <b>the</b> <b>gourd</b> is struck with a drum stick, and the vibrations are amplified using the tub of water as a resonator.|$|E
2500|$|Now {{the mate}} {{is ready to}} receive the straw. [...] Wetting the yerba by gently pouring cool water into the empty space within <b>the</b> <b>gourd</b> until the water nearly reaches the top, and then {{allowing}} it to be absorbed into the yerba before adding the straw, allows the preparer to carefully shape and [...] "pack" [...] the yerbas slope with the straw's filtering end, which makes the overall form of the yerba within <b>the</b> <b>gourd</b> more resilient and solid. Dry yerba, though, allows a cleaner and easier insertion of the straw, but {{care must be taken}} so as not to overly disturb the arrangement of the yerba. Such a decision is entirely a personal or cultural preference. The straw is inserted with one's thumb on the upper end of <b>the</b> <b>gourd,</b> at an angle roughly perpendicular to the slope of the yerba, so that its filtering end travels into the deepest part of the yerba and comes to rest near or against the opposite wall of <b>the</b> <b>gourd.</b> [...] It is important for the thumb to form a seal over the end of the straw when it is being inserted, or the negative pressure produced will draw in undesirable particulates.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, {{the dance}} {{begins in the}} afternoon, and the opening song (referred to as a [...] "Calling Song") is sung first.

When <b>the</b> <b>gourd</b> dance draws to a close, a fast song is usually the last to be performed, {{but it is not}} the [...] "official" [...] closing song.
