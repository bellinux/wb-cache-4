500|$|... "We Belong Together" [...] is an R ballad. Rolling Stone {{called it}} [...] "soulful." [...] The song is {{propelled}} by a programmed Roland TR-808-styled kick and hi-hat, which is prominently utilized in hip hop music. Reviewer Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News commented that Carey's spare and understated singing approach gave the song more power, {{which would not}} have been achieved if she had belted. The song also incorporates 1980s retro-soul music by [...] "cleverly" [...] referencing Bobby Womack's [...] "If You Think You're Lonely Now" [...] (1981) and the Deele's [...] "Two Occasions" [...] (1987), with Babyface. In the second verse of [...] "We Belong Together", Carey sings: [...] "Bobby Womack's on the radio / Singing to me, 'If you think you're lonely now'." [...] She then flips across a radio dial: [...] "So I turn the dial, tryin’ to catch a break / And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> Babyface / 'I only think of you...'." [...] The line [...] "If you think you're lonely now" [...] is from the song of the same name and [...] "I only think of you" [...] is from the chorus of [...] "Two Occasions." [...] In the remix she also says [...] "I only think of you / On two occasions / That's day and night..." [...] Due to the inclusion of the lyrics from both songs, the songwriters were given co-writing credits on the song. [...] "We Belong Together" [...] follows the common verse-chorus form and is structured into three distinct sections, with each section presenting the protagonist in different emotions. The first section chronicles the break-up of the couple, and a sorrowful tone is established as she laments her former mistakes. In the second section, the narrative switches to the present, and the protagonist becomes increasingly agitated and feels [...] "all out of her element" [...] when she attempts to distract herself by listening to the radio, but fails. [...] "We Belong Together" [...] does not have a bridge; instead, Carey transitions into the third section by raising the pitch an octave, which emphasizes the sheer frustration and desperation of the protagonist. Metro Times writer Johnny Loftus described the song's production, lyrics and vocals in detail: ...|$|E

6000|$|We {{stand around}} the grave. The day seems {{different}} {{to me from}} every other day, and the light not of the same colour--of a sadder colour.

The young does sport before me; and when I raise Killdeer, {{in order to take}} a little venison, the animals look back, and it seems as if they all had Mabel's sweet countenance, laughing in my face, and looking as if they said, 'Shoot me if you dare!' <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> her soft voice calling out among the birds as they sing; and no later than the last nap I took, I bethought me, in fancy, of going over the Niagara, holding Mabel in my arms, rather than part from her. The bitterest moments I've ever known were them in which the devil, or some Mingo conjuror, perhaps, has just put into my head to fancy in dreams that Mabel is lost to me by some unaccountable calamity--either by changefulness or by violence." ...|$|E

[...] "We Belong Together" [...] does not have a bridge; instead, Carey transitions into the third section by raising the pitch an octave, which emphasizes the sheer frustration and desperation of the protagonist. Metro Times writer Johnny Loftus described the song's production, lyrics and vocals in detail:It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads with her departed lover - 'When you left I lost a part of me / It’s still so hard to believe' - and the song’s gentle R&B roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would - you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect - and perfectly universal - pop/R&B songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic."We Belong Together" [...] is a simple, understated musical arrangement set in F lydian and composed in 4/4 time. Similarly, within the song, Carey's voice spans from G3 to the high note of A5. Carey's vocal range is demonstrated with a greater emphasis in the ending chorus, where the chorus is raised an octave higher, lying from G4 to A5. As such, Carey ends with an anticipated coda, completing both the chorus and the song with a potent, belted note of C5 for approximately four semibreves (around 17 seconds). It follows the common verse-chorus form and is structured into three sections that portray the protagonist in a range of emotions; from doleful and resigned in the first section, to desperate and agitated in the second. In the last section the song climaxes with an octave raise, which not only emphasizes the protagonist's heightened desperation, but her determination to be with her lover. The song is written in the key of C major with a slow tempo of 70 beats per minute. Carey's vocals span from G3 to A5, and the song follows a chord progression of Am-G-Em-F.|$|E

40|$|I {{want to talk}} {{a little}} bit about Loving v. Virginia, a little bit about some other issues, but mostly, I want to talk about marriage. I stand before you as a married man. I have been married for sixteen years and change. Marriage is a sacred {{institution}} for me as a Christian and a vitally important institution for the construction of society. Every society we know of either has had marriage in some form or has left us ambiguous evidence. There are some ancient societies about which we are not sure. But what anthropologists tell us today is that there is no society of which it can confidently be said, 2 ̆ 2 These folks did not, in fact, get married. 2 ̆ 2 Marriage seems to be natural to the human species. Now, of course, in today 2 ̆ 7 s terms, when we think about marriage, we think not just about Loving v. Virginia, about which I 2 ̆ 7 ll say more in a bit, but also about the question of same-sex marriage, about which I 2 ̆ 7 ll say more in a bit as well. One of the great virtues of a conference like this one is precisely, I think, the desire to celebrate marriage itself and take from that celebration lessons for other issues that may divide us. The issue of same-sex marriage is, of course, a tremendously divisive one in the nation and among scholars. Probably today 2 ̆ 7 s conference would have been more fruitful if there had been more people here who have a firm position in favor of it, as a way of generating some interesting conversation. But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> that last night you had some of that conversation anyway...|$|E
