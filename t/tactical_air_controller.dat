5000|$|Its {{most current}} period of active service in Hawaii began {{a little more}} than a year later in 1990, when it was {{activated}} as the 25th Air Liaison Squadron at Schofield Barracks. Three months later the squadron moved to Wheeler Army Airfield. [...] The unit has deployed in support of Air Force and Army missions. [...] The squadron is manned by <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>controllers,</b> a unique type of servicemembers—Air Force by service, but Army by trade, planning, communicating and facilitating the execution of close- air support for ground forces. To assist in their communication needs, the JTACs operate and maintain a complete array of equipment. <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> Control is also one of the few jobs in the Air Force operates far forward on the battlefield.|$|R

50|$|The 173rd Airborne Brigade became {{subordinate}} to the Joint Special Operations Task Force-North (JSOTF-North) which marked {{the first in the}} integration of special and conventional forces during OIF. As the brigade prepared to jump, a small drop zone support team of Army and Air Force personnel moved forward separately to link up with SOF soldiers already {{on the ground in the}} vicinity of Bashur along with elements of the 74th Long Range Surveillance Detachment (LRSD) and Air Force <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>controller</b> in Constanta, Romania.|$|E
50|$|Wearing {{the flag}} of Commander, Task Element (CTE) 95.1.1, Bataans mission was to {{blockade}} {{the west coast of}} Korea. While on station, Bataan generally flew 40 sorties a day - eight defensive CAP flights with the remainder divided between close air support (CAS), armed reconnaissance (AR), and interdiction missions. For CAS of ground forces, <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>controllers</b> usually called in Bataans Corsairs for bomb, rocket, and napalm attacks on known enemy positions. Daylight AR missions concentrated on halting enemy road traffic and bombing rail yards and bridges. The first patrol revealed the dangerous nature of this work when, between 16 and 26 January, VMF-212 lost three Corsairs, along with two pilots, to enemy small-arms fire.|$|R
5000|$|QRF is a fully {{operational}} brigade-strength force {{that has been}} established to support Jordan's existing special forces units. The QRF's task is to secure {{the area where the}} special operations forces need to operate and provide security for the operative forces, this frees up the existing special forces units, which previously had to perform the security role as well as carry out the primary mission. This facilitation role requires the QRF to be the first force to arrive in the operational area and the last to leave and, therefore, it maintains a continuous readiness with its vehicles, equipment, personnel, Black Hawk helicopters for any quick reaction inside or outside Jordan and ready to operate alongside international partners if required. The QRF has its own Joint <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Controllers</b> (JTACs) capable of calling in airstrikes.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a mathematical model}} for cognitive performance of a <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> traffic <b>controller</b> in an en-route ATC context. The aim of this model-based approach is to enable the evaluation of both accident risk and aspects like cognitive workload and effectiveness of ATC in managing air traffic situations safely. Use is made of human error modelling, Hollnagel’s cognitive mode model and Wickens Multiple Resources model. The paper describes how these psychological sub-models are combined into a single model of ATCo cognitive performance, and how the interaction of these human sub-models with the technical sub-systems is brought into account. The model is applied to an exemplary ATM scenario which consists of two parallel lanes of opposite direction traffic at the same flight level, and where the <b>air</b> traffic <b>controller</b> has no automation support tools like Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) or Flight Path Monitoring. The obtained results for this conventional ATC situation are compared to those previously obtained under the hypothetical assumption that a <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> traffic <b>controller</b> reacts to aircraft deviations {{in case of an}} STCA alert only. 1...|$|R
50|$|With {{specialized}} training, {{they also}} {{may serve as}} combat air controllers for helicopters, anti-submarine patrol aircraft, and jet strike fighter aircraft in anti-submarine <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>controller</b> (ASTAC), sea combat air controller (SCAC), and air intercept controller (AIC) roles. They also serve as watch supervisors, watch officers, and section leaders underway and in port aboard ship and at commands ashore. Operations specialists assist in shipboard navigation through plotting and monitoring the ship's position using satellite and other electronic navigation resources, as well as fixing the ship's position near landfall using radar imaging.|$|E

40|$|The {{airspace}} {{capacity in}} Terminal Movement Areas (TMAs) may increase considerably {{with the use}} of airborne spacing operations. Under this paradigm, the task of maintaining spacing to a leading aircraft in a sequence is delegated to the flight crew, aided by the Airborne Separation Assistance System (ASAS) as an automation tool. The capacity increase is a consequence of the more accurate spacing between aircraft obtained with Time-Based Spacing, shown in many studies, as well as a lower <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> Traffic <b>Controller</b> workload. The adoption of the new automation tools in this scenario, however, might bring unexpected emerging behavior, due to the combination of diverse local subsystems state changes. This study evaluates an estimated collision probability based on the TOPAZ (Traffic Organization and Perturbation AnalyZer) methodology, which includes mathematical techniques such as Dynamical Colored Petri Nets and Monte Carlo Simulation, and compares the results obtained with the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) Target Level of Safety. * Corresponding author...|$|R

50|$|Later on 17 February, a Butterfly Forward <b>Air</b> <b>Controller,</b> U.S. <b>Air</b> Force Captain Ramon Horinek, found a {{civilian}} pilot to fly {{him over the}} battlefield. Although their plane was hit three times by small arms fire while taking off, they succeeded in directing <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> strikes on the previously captured Lima Site 27. Upon return to Nakhang's Lima Site 36, that airstrip was under mortar attack. As friendly forces marked Communist positions with smoke shells, Horinek called in USAF strikes to suppress ground fire and allow a landing despite being hit twice more. Captain Horinek then set up a ground control station and directed <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> strikes all day {{with the aid of}} an airborne forward <b>air</b> <b>controller,</b> call sign Eagle. Seven sorties of F-105 <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> suppressed the mortars while setting fire to the local village.|$|R

50|$|By the {{cessation}} of hostilities, airborne forward <b>air</b> <b>controllers</b> alone were credited with flying 40,354 forward air control sorties, and directing air strikes that killed an estimated 184,808 communist troops.

50|$|During the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, a four-engined R5D-2 transport, {{especially}} configured {{to carry}} a complete <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> direction center (TADC), controlled all support aircraft as they reported on station, and assigned them to the various forward <b>air</b> <b>controllers,</b> as appropriate for the missions requested.|$|R
