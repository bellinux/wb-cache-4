5|$|It was {{the opinion}} of Mearns and White who {{investigated}} the wreck that this was unlikely as the damage was far too limited in scale, nor could it account for the outwardly splayed plates also observed in that area. Bill Jurens points {{out that there was}} no magazine of any kind at the location of <b>the</b> <b>break</b> and that the location of <b>the</b> <b>break</b> just forward of the forward transverse armoured bulkhead suggests that the ship's structure failed there as a result of stresses inflicted when the bow was lifted into the vertical position by the sinking stern section.

40|$|Results of {{numerical}} investigations, {{based on}} full dynamic equations, are presented for wave breaking in a one-dimensional environment {{with a wave}} spectrum. <b>The</b> <b>breaking</b> {{is defined as a}} process of irreversible collapse of an individual wave in physical space, and the incipient breaker is a wave that reached a dynamic condition of the limiting stability where the collapse has not started yet but is inevitable. The main attention is paid to documenting the evolution of different wave characteristics before <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> commences. It is shown that <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> is a localized process that rapidly develops in space and time. No single characteristic, such as wave steepness, wave height, and asymmetry, can serve as a predictor of <b>the</b> incipient <b>breaking.</b> <b>The</b> process of <b>breaking</b> is intermittent; it happens spontaneously and is individually unpredictable. The evolution of geometric, kinematic, and dynamic characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> wave describes <b>the</b> process of <b>breaking</b> itself rather than indicating an imminent breaking. It is shown that <b>the</b> criterion of <b>breaking,</b> valid for <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> due to modulation instability in one-dimensional waves trains, is not universal if applied to the conditions of spectral environment. In this context, the development of algorithms for parameterization of breaking for wave prediction models and for direct wave simulations is more important...|$|R
