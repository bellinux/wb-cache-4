5|$|A Thousand Leaves is the 10th studio album by the American {{experimental}} {{rock band}} Sonic Youth. It {{was released on}} May 12, 1998, by DGC Records. A Thousand Leaves was the band's first album recorded at their own studio in Lower Manhattan, which was built with the money <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> at the 1995 Lollapalooza music festival. Since the band had an unlimited {{amount of time to}} work in their studio, the album features numerous lengthy and improvisational tracks that were developed unevenly. Three highly experimental extended plays, , , and , were recorded simultaneously with the album.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, a {{controversy}} arose after Brown's appearance at King Philip Regional High School in Wrentham, Massachusetts {{as part of}} a debate on gay marriage. The high school students had launched a Facebook group attack on Brown and had made a derogatory remark about his daughter, Ayla. During his presentation, Brown defended himself and his daughter by directly quoting several vulgar statements <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> and announcing the names of the students who had written the statements. Critics questioned whether Brown should have quoted the profane comments in front of a high school audience.|$|E
5|$|In post-production, Embassy's self-imposed role {{in making}} Crimewave was even greater. Although Raimi, Tapert, and Campbell insisted that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> {{the film as}} partners, the studio refused — because of the already {{ballooning}} costs — to pay for Campbell to stay in Los Angeles during post-production (although the executives later compromised). The studio replaced Raimi's music composer, Joseph LoDuca, with {{one of its own}} choosing. It did the same with the editor, removing Raimi's influence over the film's final cut.|$|E

Their immovable property was confiscated, but {{they were allowed to}} take their personal property with them and also to recover the loans <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made.</b> No pogrom took place, which was unusual in Europe in the 14th century, according to historian Raphael Patai.|$|E
5|$|See and Bassett {{were the}} prime crew {{assigned}} to the Gemini 9 mission. They and the backup crew for the mission, Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan, were flying to St. Louis from their normal training base in Houston, Texas, for two weeks of simulator training for rendezvous and docking procedures at McDonnell Aircraft, the prime contractor for the Gemini spacecraft. It was a routine flight <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> many times previously.|$|E
5|$|Another shootout {{occurred}} between Henry Clark and Sykes Griffen on December 1, 1878, at Cassidy's Silver Reef Saloon. Although {{it is not}} known exactly what happened, it is believed that Griffen, a faro dealer at the saloon, and Clark, a regular patron, had previously argued over gambling matters. The shooting began when Griffen argued with Clark about a bet <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made.</b> After arguing for several minutes, Griffen pulled a pistol on Clark and shot him. Several witnesses said that Clark pulled a pistol on Griffen and shot him, while other witnesses said that after Clark was shot, other patrons in the saloon, including Clark's father, beat and shot Griffen.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} {{the signing of the}} peace, the two states responsible for its structure, Persia and Sparta, took full advantage of the gains <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made.</b> Persia, freed of both Athenian and Spartan interference in its Asian provinces, consolidated its hold over the eastern Aegean and captured both Egypt and Cyprus by 380 BC. Sparta, meanwhile, in its newly formalized position atop the Greek political system, took advantage of the autonomy clause of the peace to break up any coalition that it perceived as a threat. Disloyal allies were sharply punished—Mantinea, for instance, was broken up into five component villages. With Agesilaus {{at the head of the}} state, advocating for an aggressive policy, the Spartans campaigned from the Peloponnese to the distant Chalcidic peninsula. Their dominance over mainland Greece would last another sixteen years before being shattered at Leuctra.|$|E
5|$|On October10, 1984, the Government of Cape Verde {{appealed for}} {{international}} assistance. Emergency relief aid requested included: two-month {{supply of food}} for 1,124families, 1,064mattresses, 532kerosene stoves, 2,128sets of dinner ware, 2,128mugs, 1,064cooking pots and pans, 532water buckets, 2,128sheets, 1,064blankets, 2,660articles of clothing, and building materials for repair of the 1,094houses. In January1985, the government of Cape Verde announced that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> significant progress with relief assistance. However, repairs to roads, infrastructure, and crops were still required. Five organizations contributed cash, including the National Solidarity Movement, the Cape Verde Red Cross, Chinese Red Cross, Oxfam Novib, and Oxfam of the United Kingdom; donations collectively totaled to $172,221 (1984USD). France, Finland, the Soviet Union, and the United States supplied 4000tons of cereals, $79,000 (1984USD) to the Red Cross, $250,000 (1984USD) for home repairs, 32packages of medicines, and 17packages of blankets.|$|E
5|$|On {{the facts}} of Lines International, the judge held that the policy {{satisfied}} all four conditions and that {{the adoption of the}} guidelines was valid. On the fourth consideration relating to fettering of discretion, the judge found that the PSA and STPB had not rigidly enforced the guidelines as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> it clear at the meeting attended by the plaintiff that they would consider representations from cruise operators, and, in fact, a number of such concessions were made. Hence, the guidelines had been flexibly applied and the PSA had not fettered its discretion by rigidly adhering to a policy. The Lines International conditions were approved by the Court of Appeal in JD Ltd. v. Comptroller of Income Tax (2005).|$|E

5|$|The summer {{transfer}} {{window at}} Real Sociedad saw {{the arrival of}} Alonso's childhood friend Mikel Arteta. Arteta was ecstatic {{at the prospect of}} partnering Alonso in midfield but his excitement was short lived. Alonso was not picked for Real Sociedad's pre-season friendlies, signalling that an offer by Liverpool was being treated seriously. The Basque side announced on 20 August 2004 that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> a deal worth £10.7million with Liverpool and Alonso had agreed terms with the Merseyside team. Alonso did not lament the fact that a move to Real Madrid had not materialised. Instead, he concentrated on integrating with the new Spanish contingent at Liverpool under the guidance of former Valencia manager Rafael Benítez.|$|E
5|$|Trans Polar was a {{continuation}} of Tjøntveit's United States-based Trans Polar International, a retailer of general aviation aircraft. Born in Grimstad, Tjøntviet emigrated to the US in 1961 after receiving his pilot's license and became an American citizen in 1965. Trans Polar International agreed on 25 November 1969 to purchase two Boeing 720 jetliners from Eastern Air Lines. The original plans called for transporting new general aviation aircraft to customers around the world. Tjøntveit stated that the first aircraft would be delivered in May 1970 and followed by a second in December, and that Erik Sandberg would start working as vice president in May. The airline planned to hire ten pilots and had {{signed an agreement with}} Pan Am for ground handling services. Trans Polar International stated <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> agreements to operate the aircraft transport flights for at least five years.|$|E
5|$|While Murray {{prepared}} Emma for publication, Austen began The Elliots, later {{published as}} Persuasion. She completed her first draft in July 1816. In addition, {{shortly after the}} publication of Emma, Henry Austen repurchased the copyright for Susan from Crosby. Austen was forced to postpone publishing either of these completed novels by family financial troubles. Henry Austen's bank failed in March 1816, depriving him of all of his assets, leaving him deeply in debt and losing Edward, James, and Frank Austen large sums. Henry and Frank could no longer afford the contributions <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> to support their mother and sisters.|$|E

5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} defence to {{question}} the court's jurisdiction, several witnesses were questioned {{over a period of}} several weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal to focus on the case at hand. Further witnesses, including a key witness for the prosecution, came across as unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> before the trial. Other witnesses for the prosecution, including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because he was at home on the night of 13 August. Another said that the steel pipe said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, the PSC {{largely ignored}} the lease plan {{since it was}} still focused on {{building}} {{the first phase of}} the Dual Contracts. The Flushing Business Men's Association kept advocating for the Amity Street subway, causing a schism between them and the rest of the groups that supported the LIRR lease. Through the summer of 1915, the PSC and the LIRR negotiated the planned lease to $125,000 a first year, , with an eight percent increase each year; the negotiations then stalled in 1916. The Whitestone Improvement Association, impatient with the pace of negotiations, approved of the subway under Amity Street even though it would not serve them directly. The PSC's chief engineer wrote in a report that a combined 20,600 riders would use the Whitestone and Bayside lines each day in either direction, and that by 1927, there would be 34,000 riders per day per direction. The Third Ward Rapid Transit Association wrote a report showing how much they had petitioned for Flushing subway extensions to that point, compared to how little progress <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> in doing so. Negotiations continued to be stalled in 1917. Despite the line not having been extended past Corona yet, the idea of a subway extension to Little Neck encouraged development there.|$|E
5|$|Although the Duke {{was only}} an {{observer}} at Geertruidenberg, the failed negotiations gave credence to his detractors that he was deliberately prolonging the war for his own profit. Yet it was with reluctance that he returned to campaigning in the spring, capturing Douai in June, before taking Béthune, and Saint-Venant, followed in November by Aire-sur-la-Lys. Nevertheless, support for the pro-war policy of the Whigs had, by this time, ebbed away. The Cabinet had long lacked cohesion and mutual trust (particularly following the Sacheverell affair) when in the summer the plan to break it up, prepared by Harley, was brought into action by the Queen. Sunderland was dismissed in June, followed by Godolphin (who had refused to sever his ties with Sarah) in August. Others followed. The result of the general election in October was a Tory landslide and {{a victory for the}} peace policy. Marlborough remained {{at the head of the}} army, however. The defeated Junto, the Dutch, Eugene and the Emperor, implored him to stand by the common cause, while the new ministers, knowing they had to fight another campaign, required him to maintain the pressure on the enemy until <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> their own arrangements for the peace.|$|E

5|$|At 05:37 {{an enemy}} contact report was made, and course {{was changed to}} {{starboard}} to close range. Neither ship was in good fighting trim. Hood, designed twenty-five years earlier, lacked adequate decking armour {{and would have to}} close the range quickly, as she would become progressively less vulnerable to plunging shellfire at shorter ranges. She had completed an overhaul in March and her crew had not been adequately retrained. Prince of Wales, with thicker armour, was less vulnerable to 15-inch shells at ranges greater than , but her crew had also not been trained to battle efficiency. The British ships made their last course change at 05:49, but <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> their approach too fine (the German ships were only 30 degrees on the starboard bow) and their aft turrets could not fire. Prinz Eugen, with Bismarck , had Prince of Wales and Hood slightly forward of the beam, and both ships could deliver full broadsides.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Japanese attack {{began to}} slow. The {{strength}} of the Australian resistance had resulted in heavy casualties {{and as a result}} the Japanese were unable {{to take advantage of the}} gains <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made.</b> This allowed the Australians to begin their own counter-thrust on 19 October. Following a heavy artillery preparation, the 2/28th Infantry Battalion retook Katika. The Australians received reinforcements the next day with a squadron of Matilda tanks from the 1st Tank Battalion arriving by landing craft at Langemak Bay amidst tight security that was aimed at keeping their arrival secret from the Japanese. Accompanying the tanks was the 26th Brigade; its arrival meant that the 9th Division had now been committed in its entirety. Although on 21 October the Japanese withdrew from Siki Cove, the fighting around Katika continued for four more days as the Japanese attempted to retake it against fierce resistance from the 2/28th. Katagiri gave the order for his forces to withdraw back to Sattelberg by 25 October, when it became apparent that the counterattack had been defeated. The Japanese had suffered 1,500casualties, including 679killed. In comparison, the Australians had lost 49killed and 179wounded.|$|E
5|$|Both {{free and}} paid DLC was {{announced}} as being planned {{as early as}} April 2016, with paid DLC being described as a necessity due to production costs. Plans for DLC content were finalized by June of that year, with a small team working on it while the main game was completed. The main aim was to make players feel <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> a good purchase. Full production began after the main game was completed. The DLC development was handled by Haruyoshi Sawatari, who took over as producer when Tabata saw the game would not make its projected September 30 release date; Tabata continued to focus on polishing the main game, while Sawatari created the DLC {{with a group of}} core developers, although Tabata continued to oversee their production. While having story-based DLC focused on each character seemed to undermine the main appeal of the story, Sawatari noted that the breaks gave characters a chance to grow as individuals before returning to and strengthening the group. Square Enix stressed when the details were announced that the DLC was not content cut from the game itself, but original content to add new experiences for players.|$|E
