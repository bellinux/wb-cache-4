5000|$|A patent {{was granted}} to Thomas Blockley of England in 1759 for the {{polishing}} and rolling of metals. Another patent was granted in 1766 to Richard Ford of England {{for the first}} <b>tandem</b> <b>mill.</b> [...] A <b>tandem</b> <b>mill</b> {{is one in which}} the metal is rolled in successive stands; Ford's <b>tandem</b> <b>mill</b> was for hot rolling of wire rods.|$|E
50|$|A <b>tandem</b> <b>mill</b> is {{a special}} type of modern rolling mill where rolling is done in one pass. In a {{traditional}} rolling mill rolling is done in several passes, but in <b>tandem</b> <b>mill</b> there are several stands (>=2 stands) and reductions take place successively. The number of stands ranges from 2 to 18. Tandem mills can be either of hot or cold rolling mill types.|$|E
50|$|Cold Rolling Mill- Produces about 678,000 tonne of {{cold rolled}} sheets per annum, RSP’s Cold Rolling Mill has a modern 5-stand <b>tandem</b> <b>mill</b> and a 4-high 1700-mm {{reversing}} mill. The <b>tandem</b> <b>mill</b> {{is equipped with}} automatic gauge control, x-ray gauge, data logging and thyristorisation.Electrolytic Tinning LineThe continuous electrolytic tinning line produces a shining tin-coated surface {{in a variety of}} coating thicknesses. The tinplate shearing lines are equipped with sensitive pinhole detectors and an automatic sorting system.Galvanising LinesTwo continuous hot-dip galvanising lines are equipped with jet-coating facilities. There are 2 multi-roller-corrugating machines as well which produce corrugated sheets.|$|E
40|$|The {{rule that}} governs the steady state of <b>tandem</b> <b>mills</b> {{is that the}} volume of metal passing through each stand in a given time is the same. If the screw setting of the rolls or {{the speed of the}} motor on any one stand is altered so as to alter the flow rate, then the other stands must be capable of {{adjusting}} themselves to this disturbance with fixed screw and speed settings. They are able to do this because the mechanical parts of the mill are sufficiently resilient to permit the separation of the rolls to alter even though the screws are fixed, and because the characteristics of the motor drive are such that the mill speed may vary even though the speed setting is fixed. In this paper an attempt is made to relate the changes in interstand tension and finishing gauge which result from such a disturbance to the mechanical and electrical characteristics of the mill, and to predict the behaviour of <b>tandem</b> <b>mills</b> under various conditions...|$|R
40|$|The interstand tension {{coupling}} {{effect and}} strip gauge variation {{passed on to}} next stand with time delay are the main causes for regenerative chatter in <b>tandem</b> rolling <b>mills.</b> To study the effect of different factors on the stability of <b>tandem</b> rolling <b>mills,</b> different models considering different interstand factors were built. Through stability analysis of these models by employing the Lyapunov indirect method and integral criterion, more detailed and quantitative explanation is put forward to regenerative chatter mechanism in rolling. To study the time delay effect as a single factor on the stability of <b>tandem</b> rolling <b>mills,</b> stability charts of the chatter model including the time delay effect and model neglecting the delay time were compared. The {{results show that the}} time delay effect reduces the critical velocity of multistand mills slightly in the big picture. But it alters the relationship between two adjacent stands by worsening the downstream stand stability. To get preferable rolling process parameter configuration for the <b>tandem</b> rolling <b>mills,</b> the time delay effect in rolling must be involved...|$|R
40|$|During {{the cold}} rolling of thin strip on the 1220 mm five-stand <b>tandem</b> cold <b>mills,</b> scratch marks {{occur on the}} {{surfaces}} of strip and work roll. The surface quality of strip is degraded and the roll wear increases, which resulting in significant economic loss. In this paper, the mechanics of strip scratch marks was studied by carrying out both field experiments and theoretical analysis. Slippage Factor (SF) and Scratch Mark Factor (SMF) were presented to indicate the conditions of strip scratch marks. Meanwhile, mathematical models and simulation code were developed to optimise the rolling schedules and to improve the scratch marks. The practical application of the developed models to the 1220 mm five-stand <b>tandem</b> cold <b>mills</b> verifies {{the effectiveness of the}} developed models. The mathematical models can be applied to other similar <b>tandem</b> cold <b>mills...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Strip Steel or {{cold rolled}} strip is a steel product that is {{produced}} from a hot rolled strip that has been pickled. The coil is then reduced by a single stand cold roll steel mill straight away or reversing mill or in a <b>tandem</b> <b>mill</b> consisting of several single stands in a series. The strip is reduced to approximately final thickness by cold-rolling directly, or with the inclusion of an annealing operation at some intermediate thickness to facilitate further cold reduction or to obtain mechanical properties desired in the finished product. High carbon strip steel requires additional annealing and cold reduction operations. The coil is then slit to the desired width {{through the process of}} roll slitting.|$|E

50|$|Juice {{extraction}} by milling is {{the process}} of squeezing the juice from the cane under a set mills using high pressure between heavy iron rollers. Those mills can have from 3 up to 6 rolls; every set of mills are called <b>tandem</b> <b>mill</b> or mill train. For improve the milling extraction efficiency, imbibition water is added at each mill: Hot water is poured over the cane just before it enters the last mill in the milling train and is recirculated up to the reach the first mill. The juice squeezed from this cane is low in sugar concentration and is pumped to the preceding mill and poured onto the cane just before it enters the rollers, the juice from this mill is the same way pumped back up the milling train. Mixed juice (that is to say cane juice mixed with the water introduced at the last mill) is withdrawn from the first and second mills and is sent for further processing. Milling trains typically have four, five or six mills in the tandem. For improve the milling extraction performance before the cane reach the first mill, normally are used knife and shredder as preparation equipments.|$|E
5000|$|A {{new steel}} company, Bokaro Steel Limited (Bokaro Steel Plant), was {{incorporated}} on 29 January 1964 [...] {{to construct and}} operate the steel plant at Bokaro. The 1 MT phases of Bhilai and Rourkela Steel Plants were completed {{by the end of}} December 1961. The 1 MT phase of Durgapur Steel Plant was completed in January 1962 after commissioning of the Wheel and Axle plant. The crude steel production of HSL went up from 1.58 MT (1959-60) to 1.6 MT. The second phase of Bhilai Steel Plant was completed in September 1967 after commissioning of the Wire Rod Mill. The last unit of the 1.8 MT phase of Rourkela - the <b>Tandem</b> <b>Mill</b> - was commissioned in February 1968, and the 1.6 MT stage of Durgapur Steel Plant was completed in August 1969 after commissioning of the Furnace in SMS. Thus, with the completion of the 2.5 MT stage at Bhilai, 1.8 MT at Rourkela and 1.6 MT at Durgapur, the total crude steel production capacity of HSL was raised to 3.7 MT in 1968-69 and subsequently to 4 MT in 1972-73.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{equipment}} wear and operator pressure, {{as well as to}} improve the production efficiency of combined continuous pickling line and <b>tandem</b> cold rolling <b>mill</b> units, four sections’ speeds should be automatically optimized to control the three loopers’ abundance, which include the entry loopers’ entry speed, pickling speed, trimming speed, and <b>tandem</b> cold rolling <b>mill</b> entry speed. According to the optimal speed principle, a new optimization algorithm was proposed based on objective function. In this work, Nelder–Mead simplex method is applied to find the optimal solution by minimizing the objective function. In addition, the calculation of four initial speeds is specified, especially the initial <b>tandem</b> cold rolling <b>mill</b> entry speed.
