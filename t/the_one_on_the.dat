5|$|A {{comparison}} of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed {{with black and}} defined with deep shadow. On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining {{the shadows of the}} robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E
5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft {{stepped back}} from his work at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge of}} the remaining missions so that he could devote more time to planning for the Apollo program. He served on two review boards at North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the Apollo capsule. Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had made the right decisions, but, as Kraft confessed to Robert Gilruth, he found himself wishing that he had been <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot.|$|E

There are no crossovers or crossunders to allow a free transfer between directions.|$|R
5|$|Despite its {{predominantly}} military character, {{the castle}} {{is one of}} the few sites where Crusader art (in the form of frescoes) has been preserved. In 1935, 1955, and 1978 medieval frescoes were discovered within Krak des Chevaliers after later plaster and white-wash had decayed. The frescos were painted on the interior and exterior of the main chapel and the chapel outside the main entrance, which no longer survives. Writing in 1982, historian Jaroslav Folda noted that at the time there had been little investigation of Crusader frescoes that would provide a comparison for the fragmentary remains found at Krak des Chevaliers. Those in the chapel were painted on the masonry from the 1170–1202 rebuild. Mold, smoke, and moisture have made it difficult to preserve the frescoes. The fragmentary nature of the red and blue frescoes inside the chapel means they are difficult to assess. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exterior of the chapel depicted the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} hall was flanked {{on either side}} by similarly sized rooms probably accessible from the central courtyard. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west contained washing facilities and a gutter leading to a soak-away in {{the central part of}} the building, the room to the east may possibly have been a guardroom. On the western side of the courtyard were three small rooms which opened out onto the central colonnade at ground level. The function of these rooms is uncertain, but they were probably used as private accommodation for users of the mansio. The largest room in the mansio lay in the north-east corner, the chamber was heated by a channelled hypocaust system added some time after the building was first completed.|$|E
5|$|The telenovela {{features}} Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro, {{who both}} {{appeared in the}} successful telenovela Muñeca Brava, as lead actors. The {{relationship between the two}} was more than professional; Facundo Arana had spontaneously been offered a guest appearance on the Russian series A ritmo de tango starring Oreiro. Both actors agreed to appear in You Are <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> condition that they worked together. As a result, the program design was decided only after both were confirmed in the leading roles. Oreiro delayed filming proposals in Israel, Spain, and Uruguay, and the recording of her fourth music album to join the project. As in Muñeca Brava, the narrative of You Are the One revolves around a wealthy suitor and a poor woman, but unlike the former program it does not concentrate all the characters on a single narrative context. You Are the One organizes two contexts for both the rich and the poor, each one with its own characteristic locations and supporting characters.|$|E
50|$|Both {{platforms}} {{have one}} same-level fare control {{area at the}} south (geographical west) end. Each one has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. <b>The</b> <b>ones</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Pelham Bay Park-bound platform {{go up to the}} either southern corners of the T-intersection of Southern Boulevard and East 143rd Street while <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan-bound platform go up to either northern corners.|$|R
50|$|Because of its {{proximity}} to street level due to cut-and-cover construction, there is no free transfer between directions and fare control is at platform level. Both sides have a turnstile bank, token booth, and two staircases to <b>the</b> streets. <b>The</b> <b>ones</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan-bound side go up to either eastern corners of Bushwick Avenue and Grand Street while <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Canarsie-bound side go up to either western corners.|$|R
25|$|The {{platforms}} {{are approximately}} 25 feet below street {{level and the}} station's full-time fare control areas {{are at the center}} of each. A staircase of seven steps goes up to a turnstile bank and outside fare control, there is a token booth and four street stairs. <b>The</b> <b>ones</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Bronx-bound side go up either eastern corners of Lexington Avenue and East 51st Street while <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Brooklyn Bridge-bound side go up to either western corners.|$|R

The first-floor windows are covered by bulging cages of fine cast iron bars; those {{on the second floor}} are balustered.
