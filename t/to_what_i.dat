500|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{creative}} direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These compositions became {{the starting point for}} a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a fitting summary of {{the rise and fall of}} their former bandmate. Waters commented: [...] "Because I wanted to get as close as possible <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> felt... indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd." ...|$|E

According to Carlsen, however, he does not have any preferences in playing style. Kasparov said in 2013 that [...] "Carlsen is a combination of Karpov [...] Fischer. He gets his positions [...] then never lets go of that bulldog bite. Exhausting for opponents." [...] Carlsen has also stated that he follows in the traditions of Karpov and Fischer, but additionally mentions Reuben Fine as a player who [...] "was doing in chess similar <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am doing." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Emily Jupp of The Independent, despite various {{changes in}} musical direction, an [...] "unconventional fashion sense" [...] {{has been a}} {{constant}} in Diamandis's career. In the video to [...] "How to be a Heartbreaker," [...] she [...] "subverts the norm" [...] by wearing more clothes than male models in the background; she reflected that [...] "I don’t think it suits me to wear very little clothing, it just wouldn’t feel right. I’d rather people listen <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have to say instead of staring at my bum." [...] In 2011, when promoting The Family Jewels, Diamandis [...] described her fashion styles as [...] "vintage, cheerleader, and cartoon." [...] Four years later, she described her costumes then as [...] "very badly put together vintage, kind of glittery ensemble", and her outfits for Froot as a [...] "mix of '70s with digital fiberware...something surreal and '70s." ...|$|E

According to Karan Johar, Jaya Bachchan was the [...] "obvious" [...] choice for the {{character}} of Nandini, and added that her [...] "acting prowess and stature" [...] were the other reasons for him preferring to cast her. The film also marked the return of Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan together on screen after a gap of 18 years. Of her character, she said that Nandini was an extension of her own self. She elaborated, [...] "My personal feelings towards Shah Rukh are similar <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was supposed to portray in the film. There's something about him that makes me want to mother him."

500|$|Carlsen had a poor {{result in}} the third edition of Norway Chess, held 15–26 June. In the first round he {{obtained}} a winning position against Topalov after pressing in a long endgame, only to lose on time when he mistakenly thought that he would receive 15 minutes of extra time at move 60. He was then outplayed by Caruana in the second round, missed a win against Anish Giri in round 3, and lost to Anand in round 4. He won against Grischuk in round 5, drew against Nakamura and Vachier-Lagrave in rounds 6 and 7, and defeated Aronian in round 8, but he lost the last round against Jon Ludvig Hammer, leaving him in seventh place and with a performance rating of 2693. Carlsen said of this result: [...] "It's just extremely frustrating {{not to be able}} to show anything close <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am capable of in my home country." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] a large prison {{is seen in the}} background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had in mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Mendes had Spacey and Bening in {{mind for}} the leads from the beginning, but DreamWorks {{executives}} were unenthusiastic. The studio suggested several alternatives, including Bruce Willis, Kevin Costner, or John Travolta to play Lester, and Helen Hunt or Holly Hunter to play Carolyn. Mendes did not want a big star [...] "weighing the film down"; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films The Usual Suspects and Seven, and 1992's Glengarry Glen Ross. Spacey was surprised; he said, [...] "I usually play characters who are very quick, very manipulative and smart. [...] I usually wade in dark, sort of treacherous waters. This is a man living {{one step at a}} time, playing by his instincts. This is actually much closer to me, <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am, than those other parts." [...] Mendes offered Bening the role of Carolyn without the studio's consent; although executives were upset at Mendes, by September 1998, DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and Bening.|$|E

500|$|Cowell, who had {{encountered}} Ornstein while studying in New York, would pursue a similarly radical style {{as part of}} a grand intellectual and cultural mission, which also involved ambitious writings on music theory and publishing and promotional efforts in support of the avant-garde. Ornstein, the vanguard iconoclast of American classical music, followed a much more idiosyncratic muse: [...] "I'm guided entirely by just my musical instinct as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> feel is consequential or inconsequential." [...] Evidence of that is the fact that, even {{at the height of his}} ultra-modernist notoriety, he also wrote several lyrical, tonal works, such as the First Sonata for Cello and Piano: [...] " [...] was written in less than a week under a compulsion that was not to be resisted", Ornstein later said. [...] "Why I should have heard this romantic piece at the same period that I was tumultuously involved in the primitivism of [...] is beyond my understanding." [...] Commenting on the piece after Ornstein's death approximately three-quarters of a century later, critic Martin Anderson wrote that it [...] "rivals Rachmaninov's [...] in gorgeous tunes." ...|$|E
500|$|After several weeks, Waters {{began to}} visualise another concept. [...] The three new {{compositions}} from 1974's tour {{were at least}} {{a starting point for}} a new album, and [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" [...] seemed a reasonable choice as a centrepiece for the new work. [...] Mostly an instrumental twenty-minute-plus piece similar to [...] "Echoes", the opening four-note guitar phrase reminded Waters of the lingering ghost of former band-member Syd Barrett. [...] Gilmour had composed the phrase entirely by accident, but was encouraged by Waters' positive response. [...] Waters wanted to split [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", and sandwich two new songs between its two halves. [...] Gilmour disagreed, but was outvoted three to one. [...] "Welcome to the Machine" [...] and [...] "Have a Cigar" [...] were barely veiled attacks on the music business, their lyrics working neatly with [...] "Shine On" [...] to provide an apt summary of {{the rise and fall of}} Barrett; [...] "Because I wanted to get as close as possible <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> felt... that sort of indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd." [...] "Raving and Drooling" [...] and [...] "You Gotta Be Crazy" [...] had no place in the new concept, and were set aside until the following album, 1977's Animals.|$|E
500|$|Tyndall did his {{national}} service in West Germany from 1952 to 1954. A {{member of the}} Royal Horse Artillery, he achieved the rank of lance-bombardier. On completion, he returned to Britain and {{turned his attention to}} political issues. Initially interested in socialism, he attended a world youth festival held in the Soviet Union in 1957. He nevertheless began to regard left-wing politics as being infused with [...] "anti-British attitudes", moving swiftly to the political right. He had a devotion to the preservation of the British Empire and a hostility to what he regarded as the growing permissiveness of British society, stating that [...] "the smell everywhere was one of decadence". During that decade he read Mein Kampf, the autobiography and political manifesto of the late Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, growing sympathetic to Hitler's own political beliefs and Nazism. Tyndall approved in particular of [...] "the descriptions of the workings of certain Jewish forces in Germany, which seemed uncannily similar <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had observed of the same kinds of forces in Britain." [...] He concluded that Britain's {{decision to go to war}} against Nazi Germany was ultimately the result of a conspiracy headed primarily by Jews, a conspiracy which he thought had also masterminded non-white immigration into Britain after the war.|$|E

500|$|Publishers such as Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, Capcom, and Majesco Entertainment {{continued}} to release exclusive titles for the console, but the Wii's strongest titles remained within its first-party line-up. Analysts speculated {{that this would}} change in time as the Wii's growing popularity persuaded third-party publishers to focus on it; however, some third party developers expressed frustration at low software sales. Goichi Suda, developer of No More Heroes for the Wii, noted that [...] "only Nintendo titles are doing well. This isn't {{just because of the}} current situation in Japan, as this is happening outside Japan. I am very surprised about the reality about Wii, because before I was making this game, I wasn't expecting that Wii would be a console targeted only for non-gamers. I expected more games for hardcore gamers. The reality is different <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> expected." [...] Conversely, the PAL publisher of No More Heroes Rising Star Games were greatly impressed with the game's sales. Goichi Suda later retracted his comment, saying his [...] "point was that No More Heroes, unlike a lot of Nintendo Wii titles currently available is the kind of product that will attract a different kind of consumer to the hardware, i.e. gamers who are looking for a different genre to the products that have been successful on this platform thus far." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking at a {{press conference}} after the match, Murray said, [...] "As it is, I'd be very {{surprised}} if I was playing in Paris.

[...] He would go on to withdraw from Roland Garros later, citing a back injury. After a four-week break due to injury, Murray made his comeback at the 2013 Aegon Championships, where he was the top seed. After a rain delayed first day, Murray had to complete his second round match against Nicolas Mahut, and his subsequent match against Marinko Matosevic on the same day, both of which he won in straight sets. After beating Benjamin Becker in the quarterfinals, Murray next faced his first top ten opponent since losing to Tomáš Berdych in Madrid, taking on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semifinals. After dropping the first set against the Frenchman, Murray eventually raised his level and won in three to set up a final against Marin Čilić of Croatia, his third consecutive final on grass courts.
