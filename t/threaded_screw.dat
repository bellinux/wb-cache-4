2500|$|In {{order to}} explain how he visualised the courses of {{voussoirs}} in a stone skew arch, Fox wrote, [...] "The principle which I have adopted is, to work the stones {{in the form of}} a spiral quadrilateral solid, wrapped round a cylinder, or, in plainer language, the principle of a square threaded screw: hence it becomes quite evident, that the transverse sections of all these spiral stones are the same throughout the whole arch.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Screw</b> <b>thread</b> {{connection}} {{is a common}} way of detachable connection. The invalidation of <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> connection will lead to mechanical failure or even retirement. Vibration tapping is essentially a kind of high-energy impact cutting which increases the rigidity of the tool. Composite vibration tapping simultaneously with repeated cutting action reduces the surface recovery of plastic materials and enhances metal cutting rate. Theoretical study and experimental results show that vibration tapping improves the metal cutting rates, enhances the machining accuracy and makes <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> connection assembly easier. At the same time, vibration tapping process does not reduce the strength of <b>screw</b> <b>thread.</b> As the <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> can be more uniformed cut at different depths, vibration tapping enhances the strength of <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> slightly...|$|R

50|$|A sex bolt is a mating {{fastener}} combining {{a fastener}} (nut) with a fastener (screw).

50|$|Notably, {{when the}} Victorian Railways {{wanted to save}} money in marking the ends of rarely-used sidings, they would place a pair of white timber baulks across the track. With the {{introduction}} of the D/Z vans, these baulks had to be notched at the left side when approaching on the track, {{to make room for the}} underhanging <b>threaded</b> <b>screw</b> rod from the hand brake at the cupola end of the vans and avoid further damage in case of a derailment.|$|E
5000|$|Vents {{are often}} {{found on the}} front, back, top, left side panel, and {{sometimes}} {{on the right side}} panel of the case. Regardless of their placement, their purpose is either to let cool air into the case, or to let hot air out.

Newer cases include mountings for larger 120mm or 140mm cooling fans for quieter operation than the 80mm fans formerly common.|$|E
50|$|A <b>screw</b> <b>thread,</b> often {{shortened}} to thread, is a helical structure used {{to convert}} between rotational and linear movement or force.

50|$|Rear {{sub-frame}}:The rear sub-frame has locating {{points for}} the attachment of the rear plastic fairing. Of these, two in particular (a <b>threaded</b> <b>screw</b> hole each side) form a weak point where, if sufficient load {{is applied to the}} rear of the rear sub-frame (such as carrying a heavy load on a luggage rack) a crack will propagate from the screw holes eventually leading to failure of the frame. In an effort to prevent this failure many owners weld additional aluminium supports to the frame to bolster the weak areas.|$|E
50|$|The term {{jackscrew}} is {{also used}} for the captive screws that draw the two parts of D-subminiature electrical connectors together and hold them mated. When unscrewed, they allow the connector halves to be taken apart. These small jackscrews may have ordinary screw heads or extended heads (also making them thumbscrews) that allow the user's fingers to turn the jackscrew. Furthermore, the head sometimes has an internal female thread, with the male externally <b>threaded</b> <b>screw</b> shaft extending from that. The threaded-head type {{can be used to}} panel-mount one connector and provide a means to attach the mating connector to the first connector.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first patent}} {{for the cold}} rolling of <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> was issued in 1836 to William Keane of Monroe, N.Y. [...] However, the dies for rolling the <b>threads</b> onto the <b>screw</b> blanks were made of cast iron, which is brittle, so the machine was not successful.The process languished until 1867, when Harvey J. Harwood of Utica, New York filed a patent for the {{cold-rolling}} of <b>threads</b> on wood <b>screws.</b> [...] Further efforts to cold-roll <b>threads</b> on <b>screws</b> followed, but none seemed to meet with much success until Hayward Augustus Harvey (1824-1893) of Orange, N.J. filed his patents of 1880 and 1881.

50|$|Many rotary unions {{incorporate}} multiple ports, some {{of which}} are designed to handle different types of material simultaneously. A rotary union with a straight port transfers the substance directly through the rotary union. Other designs include an elbow port, which causes the material to flow out at an angle, and multiple ports. A multiple port rotary union looks like a perforated cylinder. At the end of the cylinder is a <b>threaded</b> <b>screw</b> with seals that locks on to the output. The material being transferred flows into the cylinder and out of the input holes. In the case of a rotary union with multiple inputs, chambers separated by seals keep the materials from inadvertently mixing. This type of rotary union is often used in the manufacture of plastics and other petroleum products, for which multiple inputs may need to be streamlined, but kept separate.|$|E
5000|$|C-clamps or G-clamps are {{typically}} {{made of steel}} or cast iron, though smaller clamps may be made of pot metal. At {{the top of the}} [...] "C" [...] is usually a small flat edge. At the bottom is a threaded hole through which a large <b>threaded</b> <b>screw</b> protrudes. One end of this screw contains a flat edge of similar size to the one {{at the top of the}} frame, and the other end usually a small metal bar, perpendicular to the screw itself, which is used to gain leverage when tightening the clamp. When the clamp is completely closed, the flat end of the screw is in contact with the flat end on the frame. [...] When the clamp is actually used, it is very rare that this occurs. Generally some other object or objects will be contained between the top and bottom flat edges.|$|E
