25|$|Despite {{what its}} name suggests, the Brussels-Capital Region {{is not the}} capital of Belgium in itself.

Fighting <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> seasonal became continuous and conventional. The Cambodian Civil War would escalate with the PRC backed Khmer Rouge (also backed by the exiled Sihanouk), fighting Lon Nol's central government. Following US withdrawal from Indochina, its allies in Laos and Cambodia would collapse to the North Vietnamese backed forces.|$|E

25|$|The manor, {{having been}} handed {{down to the}} eldest son, {{the rest of the}} valley was divided between the younger sons of the Gilpins for generations. What remains of the {{original}} estate is now a farm in possession of a private owner. Other important parts of the manor include Green Quarter on the eastern slopes of the valley where there is a bed and breakfast house, called Maggs Howe, <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> home to a branch of the Gilpin family.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, a team, {{working on}} a {{documentary}} for the National Geographic Channel, led by Professor Richard Freund from the University of Hartford, claimed to have found possible evidence of Atlantis in southwestern Andalusia. The team identified its possible location within the marshlands of the Doñana National Park, in the area <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> the Lacus Ligustinus, between the Huelva, Cádiz, and Seville provinces, and they speculated that Atlantis had been destroyed by a tsunami, extrapolating results from a previous study by Spanish researchers, published four years earlier.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the Treaty of Waitangi being {{negotiated}} and signed in January and February 1840, Calton Hill was probably by then a mosaic of tussock grassland and bracken shrubland with pockets of podocarp and broadleaf forest in steep gullies. Botanical records indicate the Calton Hill area <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> covered in dense podocarp, broadleaf forest had been displaced by human-lit fires. In the years prior to this it is unlikely the area would have been used by the small number of Europeans who inhabited the country.|$|E

Forer and debuted on the air on ESPN as a one-hour {{documentary on}} July 13, 2017. During an interview with The Washington Post, Forer's point in making Mike and the Mad Dog was to show just how big of an impact Francesa and Russo made on a genre <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> foreign to radio listeners but now {{is a fact of}} life.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} of the area prior to the urban renewal can still be seen in existing commercial and mixed use building of the Bulfinch Triangle. Here {{there are a few}} pubs and restaurants that feed off the traffic traveling to and from Faneuil Hall and the Garden. The residential areas that have been rebuilt are primarily upscale highrises, though the neighborhood is currently making strides to re-establish the close knit community <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>was.</b> The West End Museum currently has a permanent exhibition outlining the history of the neighborhood and its residents, while the West End Community Center hosts classes and events, in addition to putting on the annual West End Children's Festival.|$|E

Gymnasium, Carroll Gymnasium, Murphy Field House, Kyle Field, and the O'Donnell Athletic Complex, which houses Wasmer Field and Dale Gabor Track. In addition, the $11.5 million Breen Center for the Performing Arts replaced the Xavier Center in August 2009. It houses all student performing arts programs and hosts many events for other local arts groups. A new $3.3 million cafeteria has replaced the former Student Center, stage, senior lounge, and cooking areas. It was renamed the Rade Dining Hall. Both the St. Mary of the Assumption Chapel and the Murphy Field House projects were funded and overseen by Murlan J. Murphy.|$|E

25|$|A {{floodlit}} all-weather surface {{has been}} in use since January 2006, on land <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> {{part of the school}} field. Aside from the school field, which is primarily used for rugby union, the school also owns land in nearby Jesmond for sports use. This was given to the school in recompense for the land it lost when the flyover was created {{at the top of the}} school- eating into some of the land owned by the school. The school is also the landlords of Sutherland Park in Benton. Sutherland Park is named after Arthur Sutherland (1878-1883) who bought the grounds of Benton Lodge in 1925 for Novocastrians Rugby Football Club. The ground and clubhouse was sold to the school at a later date. The club was set up by former pupils of the school in 1899; many Old Novos still represent and play for the club to this day. The school has also recently agreed a 50-year lease of the County Cricket Ground on Osborne Avenue, Jesmond.|$|E
500|$|For this {{mountain}} there is photographic evidence of massive glacial retreat since {{the region was}} first extensively explored by airplane in 1936 {{in preparation for the}} peak's first ascent (see e.g. [...] ).

An expedition to the remaining glaciers on Puncak Jaya in 2010 discovered that the ice on the glaciers there is about [...] thick and thinning at a rate of [...] annually.

40|$|Most {{studies of}} fashion and fads focus on objects and {{practices}} <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>were</b> popular. We argue that limiting the sample to such trajectories generates a selection bias that obscures the underlying process and generates biased estimates. Through simulations and {{the analysis of}} a data set that has previously not been {{used to analyze the}} rise and fall of cultural practices, the New York Times text archive, we show that studying a whole range of cultural objects, both popular and less popular, is essential for understanding the drivers of popularity. In particular, we show that estimates of statistical models of the drivers of popularity will be biased if researchers use only trajectories of those practices <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>were</b> popular...|$|R
