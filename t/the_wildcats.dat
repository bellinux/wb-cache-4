5|$|For {{the first}} time since 2009, Alabama played Kentucky at Lexington, and in the game Alabama {{defeated}} <b>the</b> <b>Wildcats</b> 48–7. Although the Crimson Tide defense opened the game strong and forced Kentucky to punt after they held <b>the</b> <b>Wildcats</b> to a series of three-and-outs on their initial possessions, the Alabama offense did not see the same on-field success. After they were held to a punt on their first possession, fumbles by Kenyan Drake and T. J. Yeldon on the next two Crimson Tide possessions inside the Wildcats' 15-yard line kept the game scoreless.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>wildcat's</b> direct {{ancestor}} was Felis lunensis, or Martelli's wildcat, which {{lived in}} Europe {{as early as}} the late Pliocene. Fossil remains of <b>the</b> <b>wildcat</b> are common in cave deposits dating from the last ice age and the Holocene. At some point during the Late Pleistocene (possibly 50,000 years ago), <b>the</b> <b>wildcat</b> migrated from Europe into the Middle East, giving rise to <b>the</b> steppe <b>wildcat</b> phenotype. Within possibly 10,000 years, <b>the</b> steppe <b>wildcat</b> spread eastwards into Asia and southwards to Africa.|$|R
25|$|Throughout its range, {{small rodents}} (mice, voles, and rats) are <b>the</b> <b>wildcat's</b> primary prey, {{followed}} by birds (especially ducks and other waterfowl, galliformes, pigeons and passerines), dormice, hares, nutria, and insectivores. Unlike <b>the</b> housecat, <b>the</b> <b>wildcat</b> can consume large fragments of bone without ill-effect. Although it kills insectivores, such as moles and shrews, it rarely eats {{them because of}} the pungent scent glands on their flanks. When living close to human habitations, <b>the</b> <b>wildcat</b> can be a serious poultry predator. In <b>the</b> wild, <b>the</b> <b>wildcat</b> consumes up to 600grams of food daily.|$|R

5|$|After {{most of the}} pre-conference {{schedule}} {{but before}} the 2011–12 Southeastern Conference men's basketball schedule, Davis' teammate, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was mentioned as a possible Southeastern Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year. However, after {{less than a month}} of Southeastern Conference play, Davis was not only being mentioned as conference player of the year, but also National Player of the Year. By mid February, he was considered a National Player of the Year front-runner with his primary competition coming from Thomas Robinson of Kansas. As the season progressed, he continued to battle Robinson while developing a college level offensive game. Davis averaged a double double and 6.5 blocks in the two games (November 15, 2011 and April 2, 2012) they played against each other, both on neutral courts. Davis led <b>the</b> <b>Wildcats</b> to a perfect 16–0 record in conference play en route to the SEC conference regular season championship. Davis finished the year with averages of 14.2 points per game, 10.4 rebounds per game, 4.7 blocks per game and a field goal percentage of 62.3%. <b>The</b> <b>Wildcats</b> entered the SEC Tournament as heavy favorites and defeated LSU and Florida before losing to the Vanderbilt Commodores in the championship game. Despite the loss, <b>the</b> <b>Wildcats</b> earned the number one overall seed in the 2012 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In the Wildcats' six NCAA Tournament games, Davis averaged 15.2 points, 11.2 rebounds, and 4.6 blocks per game, and led the team to its eighth NCAA championship.|$|E

He began the 2005–06 season with the Foreurs, registering 20 points in 20 games, before being traded to the Moncton Wildcats, who were hosting the 2006 Memorial Cup. In exchange for Bourdon, <b>the</b> <b>Wildcats</b> sent Ian Mathieu-Girard, Jean-Sébastien Adam, a fourth-round pick, and a first-round selection in 2008 to Val-d'Or. Shortly after the trade, Bourdon injured his ankle, suffering a fractured fibula, high and low sprains, and a second-degree ligament tear. Although he returned to join Moncton in the playoffs, doctors {{told him that it}} would take two years to fully recover. He managed a full recovery after one year, but his turning ability and backwards skating sometimes lagged.

5|$|The Trojans next {{went home}} to face the Arizona Wildcats, led by second–year head coach Mike Stoops and quarterback Richard Kovalcheck. Though the Trojans were a 38.5point {{favorite}} and took an early lead on a LenDale White rushing touchdown, <b>the</b> <b>Wildcats</b> answered after Kovalcheck threw his own touchdown and the game was tied {{at the end of}} the first quarter. Though both teams struggled in the second quarter, Leinart was able to complete a 22-yard touchdown to Dwayne Jarrett late in the half to take a 14–7 lead. In the third quarter, White rushed for two more touchdowns, however, Kovalcheck answered both times to keep <b>the</b> <b>Wildcats</b> within a touchdown going into the fourth quarter. Early in the fourth, Leinart threw his second touchdown to Jarrett and White rushed for a fourth touchdown to give the Trojans a 42–21 win. Both White and Bush rushed for over 100yards for the third straight game, which was a school record, and the win increased the Trojan winning streak to 27games.|$|E

5|$|In the 1949–50 season, <b>the</b> <b>Wildcats</b> lost {{several of}} the leading players from their championship-winning teams to graduation, {{including}} Beard and Groza. In response, Rupp made Spivey {{the focal point of}} the team, and the team exceeded expectations. In a February 18, 1950 game against Georgia Tech, which <b>the</b> <b>Wildcats</b> won 97–62, Spivey broke the team record for points in a game with 40, two more than Groza scored in a game the previous season. That record has since been broken, but his 42field goal attempts remain a school record as of 2010. Spivey tied another of Groza's point-scoring records on March 5 with a 37-point performance in a Southeastern Conference (SEC) Men's Basketball Tournament game. Kentucky won over Tennessee 95–58 to win the SEC Tournament for the seventh consecutive season. Kentucky ended the regular season with a 25–4 record, and Spivey averaged 19.4points a game. Despite the Wildcats' record and SEC title, the NCAA Tournament selection committee did not give the team a berth in the 1950 tournament. Kentucky did gain a berth to the National Invitation Tournament, but was eliminated in the quarterfinals by City College of New York (CCNY), 89–50. In that game, Spivey was forced to the bench for the final nineminutes of the first half after accumulating fourpersonal fouls. At the end of the season, Spivey was named to the All-SEC team, and the Associated Press selected him for its 1950 All-American third team.|$|E
