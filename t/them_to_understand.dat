5|$|Both {{linguistic}} and socio-cultural factors affect {{the rate at}} which vocabulary develops. Children must learn to use their words appropriately and strategically in social situations. They have flexible and powerful social-cognitive skills that allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the communicative intentions of others {{in a wide variety of}} interactive situations. Children learn new words in communicative situations. Children rely on pragmatic skills to build more extensive vocabularies. Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later literacy and mathematical achievement, as children who are pragmatically skilled often function better in school. These children are also generally better liked.|$|E
5|$|Abi invites Dot to Christmas in Exeter but Dot insists she {{has plans}} of her own. The {{launderette}} closes on Christmas Eve, but everyone is {{too busy to}} visit her. She finds a Christmas mixtape recorded by her now-deceased friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), and takes in a stray cat, which she eventually names Dave. She spends Christmas Day alone, but when Patrick realises she has not gone to Exeter, he invites her to The Queen Victoria pub where everyone is celebrating Christmas, and her neighbours present her with the gift of a washing machine. When Ronnie, the wife of Dot's former stepson, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), and her sister Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), mother of one of Jack's children, both die, Dot tells the children {{that they are in}} heaven, helping <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> after Jack struggles to find an appropriate way to tell them. When Jack is unable to take Dot to the garden centre, she decides to drive herself with her great-grandson, Matthew Mitchell Cotton, but drives through a no entry sign into oncoming traffic and ends up in the verge. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns {{but it turns out that}} he's only back for his son. Dot's step granddaughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) lives with her for a while but moves out with Dot's blessing. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns but is left upset when Charlie leaves to go back to Ireland with Mathew, also upsetting Jack. Dot and Jack are unaware this is part of Max Branning's (Jake Wood) evil revenge for his false imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|Children {{may take}} part in Communion after their parents have {{instructed}} <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the meaning of Communion. If a person is in mortal danger and wishes to receive Holy Communion, any Christian is allowed to administer him a valid sacrament. Normally, nonetheless, the administering of the sacrament is reserved to priests. The ordination of women is allowed.|$|E

25|$|Araki {{is spoken}} today by about 8 native speakers; it is {{progressively}} {{being replaced by}} the neighbouring language of Tangoa. The rest of the island's population have a passive knowledge of Araki language, which allows <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it, and even make whole phrases and sentences. Nevertheless, {{a large portion of}} the Araki vocabulary, as well as idiosyncratic syntactic and phonetic phenomena of the language have been forgotten. Speakers of Araki can also speak the English-based pidgin Bislama; but this lingua franca is mainly used in the two towns of the country, Port-Vila and Luganville, and seldom in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|Norwegians are {{accustomed}} to variation, and may perceive Danish and Swedish only as slightly more distant dialects. This is because they have two official written standards, {{in addition to the}} habit of strongly holding on to local dialects. The people of Stockholm, Sweden and Copenhagen, Denmark, have the greatest difficulty in understanding other Scandinavian languages. In the Faroe Islands and Iceland, learning Danish is mandatory. This causes Faroese people as well as Icelandic people to become bilingual in two very distinct North Germanic languages, making it relatively easy for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the other two Mainland Scandinavian languages.|$|E
25|$|Translations of sung texts—whether of {{the above}} type meant to be sung or of {{a more or less}} literal type meant to be read—are also used as aids to audiences, singers and conductors, when a work is being sung in a {{language}} not known to them. The most familiar types are translations presented as subtitles or surtitles projected during opera performances, those inserted into concert programs, and those that accompany commercial audio CDs of vocal music. In addition, professional and amateur singers often sing works in languages they do not know (or do not know well), and translations are then used to enable <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the meaning of the words they are singing.|$|E

25|$|Once bilinguals {{acquire the}} lexical {{information}} from both languages, the bilingual lexical access will be activated in language comprehension. The lexical access in comprehension {{is the process}} how people make contact with lexical representation in their mental lexicon that contains the information, which enables <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the words or sentences. Word recognition would be no doubt the most essential process of bilingual lexical access in language comprehension, in which researchers investigate the selective or non-selective recognition of isolated words. At the same time, sentence processing also {{plays an important role}} in language comprehension, in which researchers can investigate whether the presentation of words in a sentence context would restrict lexical access to the target language only.|$|E

500|$|There are {{multiple}} features {{omitted from the}} game that the team considered typical of most video games, such as boss fights. A traditional cover system was excluded for the game as the team wanted players to constantly move around. The team also attempted to cause players to {{feel as though they}} are lacking, particularly in the supplies that they collect. [...] "You're not building yourself into a tank," [...] said Straley. This also motivated many of the design decisions of the gameplay, such as the weightlessness of the animations, and the melee combat mechanic. To further add to the realism, the team developed the game's combat mechanic in a way that forces players to spend more time planning. They also wanted players to be forced to retreat from combat after alerting the Infected, despite their belief that retreating is the [...] "anti-video game play mechanic". The combat mechanic was developed to feel intense, intentionally moving the camera closer to players, {{in order for them to}} [...] "feel every strike". The team felt that the game forces players to make difficult choices, in terms of combat, stealth and resource management, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the decisions made by the characters.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} year, Akhtar {{directed}} Positive, a film produced by Shernaz Italia and Frenzy Kodaiji, starring Boman Irani and Shabana Azmi. It {{was a short}} film running for 12 minutes. Dealing with a family's attitude towards a person suffering from HIV-AIDS, the film was shot in Mumbai and aimed at creating awareness about the problem. It also introduced Arjun Mathur in the film industry. Speaking about {{the purpose of the}} project, Akhtar stated that [...] "Just as a social stigma, many people believe that an HIV patient should be isolated. They also have certain misconceptions about dealing with the disease. And since India has a lot of joint families, it becomes very important for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the value of support to the person who has acquired this disease. This is exactly what Positive talks about." [...] The film had its background score composed by Ram Sampath but had no soundtrack.

500|$|The hit [...] "Around the World", which harkens {{back to the}} Chili Peppers' funk-influenced sound, was {{constructed}} by Frusciante at his home. The rhythm and beat, however, are intricate; this required him to play the song {{with the rest of}} the band rather than alone for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it. The bass lick was composed in [...] "maybe 15 minutes," [...] according to Frusciante: [...] "Flea is the best bass player in the world. His sense of timing and the way he thinks is so crazy." [...] The title track of the album was among the most difficult for the band to complete. Frusciante felt compelled to write an appropriate guitar ensemble that would appropriately complement the poignant lyrical content, but encountered difficulty. The song was barely making progress, and would have been scrapped had it not been for Kiedis' urgency to include it on the album. Frusciante completed the final riff two days before recording, after drawing inspiration from The Cure's soundtrack song to [...] "Carnage Visors". The title track was intended to represent Californian lifestyles and, more specifically, the [...] "fake" [...] nature which is associated with much of Hollywood. It references Kurt Cobain of Nirvana and uses considerable imagery to capture the evocative nature of California.|$|E
