40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} reduce {{operational}} costs related to transportation activities in road haulage, small and medium-sized freight carriers can establish horizontal coalitions and share their resources. Through exchange of customer requests with other members within the coalition, carriers can improve the operational efficiency of their transportation processes. In this paper, <b>transhipment</b> <b>is</b> integrated into the conventional pickup and delivery problem in the collaborative context. Specifically, vehicles involved in transferring the same request are synchronized at the transhipment points. A mixed-integer programming model is proposed for this problem. Based on this model the benefits of <b>transhipment</b> <b>are</b> analysed. Computational results show considerable cost-savings enabled by transhipment in the operational planning of carrier coalitions...|$|R
50|$|Once <b>transhipment</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} to the RCMP vessel, {{the drugs}} were brought into Canada {{and taken to}} Montreal under heavy police escort. The drug shipment was to be delivered to the West End Gang on June 2, 2006. This is when the arrests were made. The federal police seized the 22.5 tons of hashish and CAN$195,000 from the criminal organization.|$|R
30|$|As far as <b>transhipment</b> <b>is</b> concerned, {{operations}} {{within the}} terminals {{were used as}} a summary value for the transport unit, which inherently involves movements, operations boundary, railway manoeuvres and internal checks, {{as well as the}} average time that the truck spends inside the terminal. In this phase of the study, single cost items of the terminal activities were not investigated in detail because of the great uncertainty of the related variables.|$|R
30|$|The {{efficiency}} {{and effectiveness of}} rail freight services is largely dependent on the {{efficiency and}} effectiveness of terminals, marshalling yards along the transport chain, and feeder transports. <b>Transhipment</b> in terminals <b>is</b> traditionally performed vertically, {{using a variety of}} equipment, such as Transtainer (gantry crane), Reach Stacker, Straddle carrier, or Fork lift. With this type of equipment, a container is lifted from a train and moved to a stack yard, either for storage, or loading onto a truck, etc. Comparatively speaking, this vertical <b>transhipment</b> <b>is</b> costly, time consuming and incurs a higher risk of loss/damage to cargo. Moreover, 80  % of European trailers cannot be lifted, restricting market share.|$|R

30|$|Taking {{into account}} the {{transhipment}} and third party costs, the rail freight operator would have to identify ways to reduce to cost. Also {{there were a number}} of operational requirements, such as a frequent service operated in conjunction with passenger timetables. Linking to the previous discussion, the bundling of goods could lead to increased volumes, facilitating a multi-stop service. The interview with P&G suggested that multi-stop train services were not feasible without fast and reliable transhipment, where a freight train stopped in a terminal for only short transit time – much like passenger train station stops. Such faster <b>transhipment</b> <b>was</b> unrealistic using traditional vertical transhipment techniques and equipment (forklift or gantry crane), leading us to recommend that a new <b>transhipment</b> technique would <b>be</b> required to reduce the building and operations cost of a rail terminal.|$|R

50|$|Trans{{shipment}} or <b>Transhipment</b> <b>is</b> {{the shipment}} of goods or containers to an intermediate destination, {{and then from}} there to yet another destination. One possible reason {{is to change the}} means of transport during the journey (for example from ship transport to road transport), known as transloading. Another reason is to combine small shipments into a large shipment (consolidation), dividing the large shipment at the other end (deconsolidation). Transshipment usually takes place in transport hubs. Much international transshipment also takes place in designated customs areas, thus avoiding the need for customs checks or duties, otherwise a major hindrance for efficient transport.|$|R
