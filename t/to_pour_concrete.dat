The bid was won by Rock Construction Company of Sunset Park on June 25 at the cost of $757,886.60, who noted that official construction began on July 16. By August, trees had been removed and the flooded out would be moved away from the creek to avoid future issues.

5000|$|Mt. Broderick {{was built}} in two months in late 1926 at the Pullman factory in Chicago, Illinois. It was one of thirty cars built on Lot 4998 to Plan 3521A.

In its normal overnight-mode, it could sleep 20, although in day-mode, it could seat a maximum of fifty-two passengers.

50|$|Compared to sealed roads, {{which require}} large {{machinery}} <b>to</b> work and <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> or <b>to</b> lay and smooth a bitumen-based surface, gravel roads are easy and cheap to build. However, compared to dirt roads, all-weather gravel highways are quite expensive to build, as they require front loaders, dump trucks, graders, and roadrollers {{to provide a}} base course of compacted earth or other material, sometimes macadamised, covered {{with one or more}} different layers of gravel. Graders are also used to produce a more extreme camber compared to a paved road to aid drainage, as well as to construct drainage ditches and embankments in low-lying areas. Cellular confinement systems can be used to prevent the washboarding effect.|$|R

50|$|The project, {{which would}} {{at that time}} become the world's second tallest building, was {{originally}} conceived of and owned by Jerry Wolman in late 1964, the project being financed by John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. Construction of the tower was interrupted in 1967 due to a flaw in an innovative engineering method used <b>to</b> <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> in stages that was discovered when the building was 20 stories high. The engineers were getting the same soil settlements for the 20 stories that had been built as what they had expected for the entire 99 stories. This forced the owner to stop development until the engineering problem could be resolved, and resulted in a credit crunch. This situation {{is similar to the}} one faced during the construction of 111 West Wacker, then known as the Waterview Tower. Wolman's bankruptcy resulted in John Hancock taking over the project, which retained the original design, architect, engineer, and main contractor.|$|E
50|$|Construction was {{at first}} ceased until November 1946 as President Harry S.

In 1947, diversion of the Savannah River and construction of a coffer dam began while the contract for the actual dam was awarded. The construction plant for the dam was also completed in 1947, containing equipment to create concrete that would be transported anywhere on the construction site via three-revolving gantry cranes with 124 ft. booms. In 1948, after the foundation was excavated, workers began <b>to</b> <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> on site for the spillway. In 1949, initial work on the concrete spillway was completed; the original coffer dam was removed and a second cofferdam was installed in order to restore {{the flow of the}} Savannah River to its original channel but now through eight-sluice gates in the spillway structure. Concrete operations on {{the main part of the}} dam had halted in 1949 because of a steel-strike but resumed in 1950 and much of the spillway was completed by the end of the year.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Obstacles such as bumps, curb descents, {{and uneven}} driving {{surfaces}} cause vibrations {{that affect the}} wheelchair, and in turn, the wheelchair user. Chronic exposure can cause low-back pain, disk degeneration, and other harmful effects. Little {{research has been conducted}} to assess the vibrations experienced by wheelchair users. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to conduct an evaluation of the vibration exposure during electric-powered wheelchair driving and mechanical energy requirements for manual wheelchair propulsion over selected sidewalk surfaces. The goal was to determine the criteria for a wheelchair-pedestrian access route that does not require excessive propulsive work or expose wheelchair users to potentially harmful vibrations. METHODS: Ten unimpaired individuals participated in this study. Six sidewalk surfaces were tested. Measured variables included power of the acceleration per octave, mechanical work to propel over surfaces, peak acceleration, and frequency at which peak acceleration occurs. RESULTS: For both the manual and electric-powered wheelchair, at 1 m/s, significant differences were found in peak accelerations between the seat and footrest (P < 0. 0001) and between the sidewalk surfaces (P = 0. 004). The greatest risk for injury caused by shock and vibration exposure occurs at frequencies near the natural frequency of seated humans (4 - 15 Hz). The values for work required to propel over the surfaces tested were not statistically significantly different. Besides appearance and construction, the only distinguishing characteristic was surface roughness caused by the joints. CONCLUSION: When treating the <b>poured</b> <b>concrete</b> sidewalk as the standard, surfaces 2, 3, 5, and 6 compared most favorably in terms of vibration exposure, whereas surface 4 produced mixed results. Surfaces 2, 3, 5, and 6 yielded results that were similar <b>to</b> the <b>poured</b> <b>concrete</b> sidewalk and could be considered acceptable for wheelchair users. In conclusion, surfaces other than the traditional <b>poured</b> <b>concrete</b> can be used for pedestrian access routes without adding vibration exposure or reducing propulsion efficiency...|$|R
