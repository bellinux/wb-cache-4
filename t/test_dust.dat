40|$|Current media-scale {{multipass}} simulations in GeoDict/FilterDict {{work with}} a fixed amount of <b>test</b> <b>dust</b> per particle batch. This does not account properly for the transition from depth filtration to cake filtration. During depth filtration, the amount of <b>test</b> <b>dust</b> may be larger because a three-dimensional volume is available for deposition. When the surface filtration regime is entered, only a two-dimensional surface is available for deposition. With a fixed amount of <b>test</b> <b>dust</b> per particle batch, either the simulation is inefficient because the amount is chosen appropriately for the surface filtration, and many more flow fields are computed than necessary during the depth filtration, or the simulation has to be stopped after the depth filtration because too high particle concentrations would yield unrealistic overlapping particles and too high pressure drop in the cake filtration regime.

40|$|The {{ingestion}} {{and subsequent}} deposition of volcanic ash (VA) {{is considered a}} major threat to performance and lifetime of aero-engines. Degradation of ceramic thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) of combustor walls, turbine blades and vanes is associated with chemical interaction between the TBC material and molten VA.
