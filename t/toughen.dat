Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as beryllium chloride with metallic potassium or sodium.

5|$|Maya warfare {{was not so}} much {{aimed at}} {{destruction}} of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder. The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Petén Maya as bows and arrows, fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Pedro de Alvarado described how the Xinca of the Pacific coast attacked the Spanish with spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to <b>toughen</b> it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish. The Maya had historically employed ambush and raiding as their preferred tactic, and its employment against the Spanish proved troublesome for the Europeans. In response to the use of cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits on the roads, lining them with fire-hardened stakes and camouflaging them with grass and weeds, a tactic that according to the Kaqchikel killed many horses.|$|E
5|$|With Japan's {{entry into}} the war {{following}} the attacks on Pearl Harbor and Malaya, it became {{more likely that the}} division would be called upon to undertake active service overseas, and the division was mobilised for war. In early January 1942, Major General Stanley Savige, an experienced officer who had commanded the 17th Brigade in combat against the Germans in the Middle East earlier in the war, took over command of the division. Savige set about the task of preparing the division for combat and he began by removing officers that he did not think were physically fit enough or competent to lead in battle and replacing them with men who had gained experience in AIF units. A comprehensive training program was established and in April 1942 the division was assigned to the Australian I Corps, and in order to enable divisional exercises to begin, the 3rd Division moved to Bonegilla, Victoria. In order to <b>toughen</b> the men up, Savige decided that they would march on foot to the new camp.|$|E

30|$|Generally, the EP <b>toughening</b> methods mainly include {{thermoplastic}} resin <b>toughening,</b> rubber <b>toughening,</b> organic silicon resin <b>toughening,</b> rigid particle <b>toughening</b> and nano-particles <b>toughening,</b> etc. Rubber <b>toughening</b> mechanism is the “silver streaks—nail anchor” mechanism and “silver lines—shear zone” mechanism (Yahyaie and Ebrahimi 2013). After having <b>toughened</b> with rubber, {{the resistance to}} impact and bending performances have been significantly improved (Rahman et al. 2013), however, the strength, modulus and heat resistance performance is weakened due to the lower strength and modulus of rubber. Thermoplastic resin modified by rubber can improve the toughness (Giannotti et al. 2003), but the stiffness and heat resistance are reduced. Nano-particles have large surface activity, which is easy to produce physical or chemical combination with the polymer (Al-Turaif 2010), which can resist micro-crack initiation. Compared with EP composite material <b>toughened</b> by rubber, the strength and rigidity are decreased (Créac’hcadec et al. 2014).|$|R
5|$|Maya armies {{were highly}} disciplined, and warriors participated in regular {{training}} exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male {{was available for}} military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders. Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; {{the needs of their}} crops usually came before warfare. Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder. Maya warriors entered battle against the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones. They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Petén Maya as bows and arrows, fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to <b>toughen</b> it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins. The Maya had historically employed ambush and raiding as their preferred tactic, and its employment against the Spanish proved troublesome for the Europeans. In response to the use of cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits on the roads, lining them with fire-hardened stakes and camouflaging them with grass and weeds, a tactic that according to the Kaqchikel killed many horses.|$|E

The effect of period, period ratio and microstructure on <b>toughening,</b> and the application of multilayer structure <b>toughening</b> in wear and erosion were also discussed. Micro-crack deflection is the main mechanism of <b>toughening,</b> but the more interface, the more initiation of cracks, results in spalling failure in case of little interfacial toughness.

In order to show the advantage of nano multilayer film, a good interfacial toughness must be obtained,and the blocking of the propagation of micro cracks should be considered from fracture mechanics point of view...|$|R

40|$|The {{fracture}} toughness of ceramics {{can be improved}} by the incorporation {{of a variety of}} discontinuous, elastic reinforcing phases that generate a crack-bridging zone. Recent models of <b>toughening</b> by crack-bridging processes are discussed and used to describe the behavior observed in whisker-reinforced ceramics. The <b>toughening</b> response in ceramics reinforced with other types of discontinuous reinforcements is then considered (e. g., matrix and second-phase platelike grains, elongated matrix grains, and grain-size effects in noncubic matrices). It is shown that crack-bridging <b>toughening</b> processes can be combined with other bridging mechanisms and with other <b>toughening</b> mechanisms (e. g., transformation <b>toughening)</b> to achieve synergistic effects. From these discussions, it is shown that the design of the <b>toughened</b> materials relies heavily on the control of the material properties and microstructural components influencing the <b>toughening</b> behavior to optimize the contributions of both the reinforcing phase and the matrix.

The modulus effect is relatively small and process-zone-size-independent. The dilatational effect is potentially more substantial, as well as being the primary source of the R curve. The dilatational contribution is also zone-size-dependent. The analysis demonstrates that microcrack <b>toughening</b> is less potent than transformation <b>toughening...</b>|$|R

Goats and donkeys were widely used to feed abandoned babies in foundling hospitals in 18th- and 19th-century Europe.
