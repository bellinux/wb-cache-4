5000|$|Some {{economic}} historians, such as Barry Eichengreen, {{blame the}} gold standard of the 1920s for prolonging the economic depression which started in 1929 and lasted for about a decade. In the United States, adherence to {{the gold standard}} prevented the Federal Reserve from expanding the money supply to stimulate the economy, fund insolvent banks and fund government deficits that could [...] "prime the pump" [...] for an expansion. Once off the gold standard, it became free to engage in such money creation. The gold standard limited {{the flexibility of the}} central banks' monetary policy by limiting their ability to expand the money supply. In the US, the central bank was required by the Federal Reserve Act (1913) to have gold backing 40% of its demand notes. Others including former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Nobel Prize-winner Milton Friedman place the blame for the severity and length of the Great Depression {{at the feet of the}} Federal Reserve, mostly due to the deliberate <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> even after the gold standard. They blamed the US major economic contraction in 1937 on <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> resulting in higher cost of capital, weaker securities markets, reduced net government contribution to income, the undistributed profits tax and higher labor costs.

40|$|The {{relative}} positive {{economic growth}} experienced by most African {{countries in the}} recent decade has come with insufficient demand stimulation. The concern of poverty {{at the forefront of}} economic policy, the need for inclusive growth and sustainable development, inter alia, brings forward the inevitable question <b>of</b> the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> responsibility. Accordingly, the monetarist theory that focuses on price stability inherently neglects the demand stimulation aspect of economic prosperity. Since the mid 1980 s, the monetarist school driven by its central aim of fighting inflation and maintaining credibility in markets and economic agents has been priority for monetary authorities (especially in Africa). To this effect, while good results in terms of inflation targeting has been achieved in many African countries; economic growth has sometimes been low. Hence, in light of the above, using a statistical and theoretical debate method, the Credible <b>Monetary</b> <b>Policy</b> (CMP) i paradox is traceable to Africa. Accordingly, with the promising economic environment in Africa, we recommend the promotion <b>of</b> a <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> oriented toward improving economic growth under the constraint of price stability. In light of the above view, there are some note worthy signs such the recent decision by the two CFA zone central banks to either maintain interest rates at a low level or reduce it despite <b>tightening</b> measures <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> taken by the European Central Bank (ECB) earlier in the year. In the same vein, the central bank of South Africa has maintained its policy of low interest rates with an objective of economic expansion. Since, the 2008 financial crisis, the consolidation of the Federal Reserve’s declared final objective of lowering interest rates and making emergency loans is an eloquent example to reassure African central banks in the choice <b>of</b> the pro-growth <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> option. ...|$|R
40|$|If markup ratios {{fluctuate}} widely, so does output {{volume and}} investment. This magnifies {{the business cycle}} and increases uncertainty about future economic conditions. This paper investigates the implication for <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> by analyzing markup ratios. The main conclusions are (1) {{as a result of}} the failure of Japanese firms to fully adjust their prices to exogenous shocks, markup ratios sometimes greatly deviate from trend lines. (2) According to the menu-cost theorem, the existence of costs associated with price changes prevents firms from changing prices to the level consistent with marginal costs, thus reducing social welfare. In this regard, establishing a money supply rule under which monetary authorities accommodate exogenous shocks provides an incentive for firms to change their prices. (3) Markup pricing magnifies the social welfare cost of inflation. In this argument, monetary authorities have the optimal choice <b>of</b> <b>tightening</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> even under low inflation, if they observe that markup ratios have remained high. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{remarkable}} {{surge in}} private capital flow {{to developing countries}} since 1990 has greatly facilitated their rapid growth, {{at a time when}} OECD countries have been in, or passed through, recession. The importance of these flows to the current account of severallarge developing countries has caused concern about their sustainability, especially if international interest rates continue rising. The form of these flows, and their source - investors rather than commercial banks - causes concern about their short-term volatility. To address the issue of sustainability, the authors draw on analyses of international financial flows and economic prospects carried out by the Bank's International Economics Department. They conclude that private capital flows to developing countries are likely to be sustained at, or near, current total levels for the following reasons: (a) Much of the private flow comes from direct investment. Foreign direct investment has increased as international businesses pursue globalization strategies. Firms are taking advantage of liberalization drives and rising incomes in developing countries, as well as dramatic changes in transport and telecommunications - factors that are structural rather than cyclical, and that are likely to be reinforced by implementation of Uruguay Round agreements. (b) Sources of finance are more diversified. There is greater risk-sharing between creditor and debtor. Funds are predominantly going to the private sector (not sovereign governments). Also, developing countries still account for less than 1 percent of the investment portfolios of OECD investors. In the 1970 s, commercial loans accounted for proportionately more flows. Now, increasingly large roles are played by bondholders, equity investors, and money market funds. (c) A prolonged major increase in international interest rates would jeopardize continuation of the flows at current levels, but the likelihood of such an increase in {{the next three to five}} years is slim. Any rise in interest rates in industrial countries will largely reflect rising demand for credit because of increased economic activity, which will benefit developing country exports. Commodity prices have surged in the past six months, but measures of core inflation, including unit labor cost, are at a historic low. This scenario is very different from the combination of high interest rates and economic recession the developing would faced in the early 1980 s, as high and rising inflation induced sudden <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies.</b> Still, significant areas of risk deserve attention from developing country governments, international financial institutions, and industrial country investors. Some major recipients of private capital flow are vulnerable to sudden changes in both domestic or external environments. And portfolio equity flows are likely to be more volatile than other forms of private capital flows. The policy response to large capital inflows should depend on whether the current account deficit is sustainable and the degree to which it is over - or underfinanced. While the external environment is favorable, vulnerable countries have a window of opportunity to undertake adjustment.

Counterfactual simulations indicate that world prices would have increased slightly between 1929 and 1933, instead of declining calamitously, if the historical relationship between world gold reserves and world prices had continued.

With effective owners' control being prohibitively costly in the state-owned firms, "nobody's" banks continue their old lending pattern to large state-owned enterprises regardless of the latters' creditworthiness and profitability.
