5|$|According to Skeat {{the note}} in the codex {{indicated}} that the manuscript had not previously been in the Patriarchal Library in Alexandria. The manuscript was carried from Constantinople to Alexandria between 1308 and 1316, together with two mentioned above manuscripts of Chrysostom. It remained in Alexandria until 1621, when Cyril removed it once to Constantinople. Whether was originally written, in Constantinople or in Alexandria, is another question. Skeat did not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the answer on this question ("if any future scholar wisches to claim a Constantinopolitan origin for the Codex Alexandrinus, {{it is at least}} open to him to do so"). This view was supported by McKendrick, who proposes Ephesian provenance of the codex.|$|E

When Wałęsa complained that the Polish government was not keeping to its promise of allowing the independent labour movement enough of an opportunity to publicize itself, Jagielski indicated that he would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the movement better access to the Polish press, and to the Polish radio network. Jagielski led a delegation that went to a meeting in Moscow of Comecon, the Eastern Bloc economic community, during January 1981. That month, the government declared that the poor economy was forcing it {{to cut back on}} its promise of ensuring that Polish workers did not have to work on Saturdays, and that it would offer a number of Saturdays as work-free instead.|$|E

5|$|The {{offensive}} onslaught {{continued in}} the second half, though it was California that took the advantage at first. Bolstered by an improved defensive effort that held the Hokies scoreless throughout the third quarter, California, behind quarterback Aaron Rodgers, scored 21 unanswered points to take a 42–28 lead into the fourth quarter. But in that quarter, the Hokies clawed back into competition. Tech scored a touchdown to begin the quarter, but Cal answered right back with one of its own, making the score 49–35. The Hokies then evened the score at 49–49 after an 80-yard drive that took {{less than two minutes}} and a punt return by DeAngelo Hall for a touchdown. With time running out, Cal still had a chance to drive for a game-winning score. The post-score Tech kickoff went out of bounds, giving the Bears possession at their 35-yard line. Cal needed just sevenplays to march 47yards to set up the game-winning field goal. As time expired, kicker Tyler Frederickson kicked a 35-yard field goal <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> California the 52–49 win.|$|E

25|$|Following two early {{penalties}} by Stephen Jones, the Lions led 6–0 {{and things}} looked promising for them. All Black captain Tana Umaga was sin-binned for killing the ball, but even without their captain, the All Blacks managed to score two tries, by Conrad Smith and Ali Williams, both converted by Luke McAlister. The Lions were awarded two more penalties, which Stephen Jones kicked, {{but just before}} the break, Umaga scored a <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the All Blacks a half-time lead of 24–12.|$|E

As the group realize they have no choice but to take Karli with them, Sigurd finally catches up after having chased them for 16 days.

Enraged, Sigurd gives chase but Gudrid and Full-Eyes escape by jumping from the cliff into the sea and swimming to the ship. In order to shake off Sigurd, Leif decides to sail further north.|$|E

25|$|Training {{methods are}} {{as varied as}} the pigeons themselves. Some fanciers believe their system is the secret to their success and guard these hard learned lessons closely. Most fanciers will explain their basic {{strategy}} but some may be reluctant to share the details of their success. One of the most popular systems is widowhood. This system uses the birds desire to reproduce as motivation to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the bird a sense of urgency on race day. The use of widowhood is usually begun by first allowing the racer to raise a baby in their nest box. After the baby is weaned the hen is removed and often the nestbox is closed off, from then on the only time these birds are allowed to see their mate or enter the nest box is upon returning from training or a race. This conditioning {{is one of the key}} elements in a lot of racing programs.|$|E
25|$|Going into day five, the Australians {{sought to}} set a quick total, and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> {{themselves}} enough time to bowl England out inside a day. They had accomplished the feat already during the series, but the weather continued to threaten over London. The tourists wanted quick runs, and Taylor attempted to attack from the outset, but was undone after adding just two runs caught behind off Small for 48. Boon was soon run out for 37, also trying to lift the run-rate, and then Border and Jones again combined {{to go on the}} attack. Border made 51 not out off 74 balls, and although Jones eventually fell, bowled by Capel for 50 off 69 balls, the pair had added a rapid partnership of 89. Steve Waugh joined his captain, but his stay was short lived, as they soon passed Border's desired target score of 400. The Australian second innings was declared closed on 219 for 4, leaving England an unlikely target of 403 of just over two sessions.|$|E

[...] She described [...] "Push the Button" [...] as a song [...] "with meaning and real life references", and characterised it as having a [...] "street vibe". Austin produced the song, which was recorded at DARP Studios in Atlanta & Home Recordings, London. [...] "Push the Button" [...] was mixed by Jeremy Wheatley at TwentyOne Studios, London, in collaboration with Richard Edgeler. Rick Shepphard engineered the song.|$|E

500|$|Jacqui {{has been}} {{described}} as a feisty character who is tough and hard. Holy Soap refer to her as a [...] "tough ex-con". Jacqui often takes on the matriarch role. Jacqui deals with the sisters in a different way and can get different responses from the sisters. Cooper describes her as always being there to pick up the pieces for her family. She also states that Jacqui is very loyal and the most loyal character out of the McQueen family. Speaking of Jacqui's time away from forefront plots Cooper has said: [...] "I think that Jacqui's one of those characters who, if she isn't on screen for a while, it takes the audience time to warm to her again. But when they do, they find her funny, they find her interesting and I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them as much as I can." ...|$|E

500|$|Swift {{uses her}} life {{experiences}} as an inspiration in her work. In her songs, Swift often addresses the [...] "anonymous crushes of {{her high school}} years" [...] and celebrities. Swift frequently criticizes ex-boyfriends, an aspect of her songwriting downplayed by The Village Voice: [...] "Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic." [...] However, New York believes the media scrutiny over her decision to [...] "mine her personal life for music … is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers". The singer herself has said that not all her songs are factual {{and that they are}} sometimes based on observations. Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries not to talk about song subjects specifically [...] "because these are real people. You <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus".|$|E
