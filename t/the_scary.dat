Jiminy Cricket and the player venture into the worlds of the stories to restore the happy endings. In the altered (and game's final) story, where there is no Prince, the Queen (appearing in both of her forms) has built a lair {{resembling}} her poisoned apple inside <b>the</b> <b>scary</b> wood, and has put Snow White to eternal sleep in her dungeon and intends to do the same to the Seven Dwarfs. The player needs to correctly mix ingredients for several potions including the True Love Potion to magically summon the Prince and save the day. It is followed by the fight with the Queen where she tries to get away and the player has to reflect her magic ball spells, until she retreats to her lair. There, while asking her mirror, she suddenly transforms into a hag and the mirror breaks.|$|E

25|$|Updike is {{a master}} of {{effortless}} motion—between third and first person, from the metaphorical density of literary prose to the demotic, from specific detail to wide generalisation, from the actual to the numinous, from <b>the</b> <b>scary</b> to the comic. For his own particular purposes, Updike devised for himself a style of narration, an intense, present tense, free indirect style, that can leap up, whenever it wants, to a God's-eye view of Harry, or the view of his put-upon wife, Janice, or victimised son, Nelson. This carefully crafted artifice permits here assumptions about evolutionary theory, which are more Updike than Harry, and comically sweeping notions of Jewry, which are more Harry than Updike.|$|E

500|$|... "I sneaked {{up there}} a few times. And under the bright, unforgiving lights of television, I was able to {{encounter}} the real Michelangelo. I {{was so close to}} him I could see the bristles from his brushes caught in the paint; and the mucky thumbprints he'd left along his margins. The first thing that impressed me was his speed. Michelangelo worked at Schumacher pace. Adam's famous little penis was captured with a single brushstroke: a flick of the wrist, and the first man had his manhood. I also enjoyed his sense of humour, which, from close up, turned out to be refreshingly puerile. If you look closely at the angels who attend <b>the</b> <b>scary</b> prophetess on the Sistine ceiling known as the Cumaean Sibyl, you will see that one of them has stuck his thumb between his fingers in that mysteriously obscene gesture that visiting fans are still treated to today at Italian football matches." ...|$|E

Dixon created a documentary for the BBC, Don't Hit My Mum, regarding the issue of domestic abuse from a child's perspective, and remarked upon her own childhood: [...] "When I think about that time, I don't remember living in harmony, I don't remember any fun times, I suppose because the negativity has clouded it.

O'Donnell confirmed that the chanting monks of Halo: Combat Evolveds choral theme, along with additional guitars by Steve Vai, would return in Halo 2. O'Donnell noted that the new setting of Africa prompted him to look at [...] "Afro-Cuban" [...] influences, but most {{of this type of}} music did not make it to the final product. Rather than write for locations or use leitmotifs for all the different characters in what O'Donnell called a [...] "Peter and the Wolf approach to music", O'Donnell wrote [...] "sad music for sad moments, scary music to score <b>the</b> <b>scary</b> bits and so forth." [...] Recurring themes developed more by accident than planning.

According to him, the song's breakdown [...] "brilliantly utilizes that 'Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep' bedtime prayer {{in such a way}} as to add to <b>the</b> <b>scary</b> movie aspect of the song". Steve Huey, in Allmusic review of Metallica, described it as one of the album's best songs, with [...] "crushing, stripped-down grooves". Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone described [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] as [...] "possibly the first metal lullaby" [...] and wrote that the song [...] "tell the tale" [...] of the album's [...] "detail and dynamic, [...] song structures and impact of individual tracks". [...] Sid Smith from the BBC called the song [...] "psycho-dramatic" [...] and noted that the [...] "terse motifs served notice that things were changing" [...] with Metallica's new album.

500|$|By June1995 Williamson brought <b>the</b> <b>Scary</b> Movie {{script to}} his agent, Rob Paris, {{to put out}} for sale.

[...] Following the script's purchase by Miramax, Williamson was required to remove much of the gorier content, such as graphic depictions of the internal organs of gutted murder victims [...] "rolling" [...] down their legs. However, once Craven was secured as director, he was able to bring much of the excised content back. Williamson was going to remove a scene in the school bathroom featuring Sidney, as he felt it was awkward and out of place in the film. Craven insisted the scene should remain, as he felt it developed the character and her relationship with her deceased mother. [...] Williamson later confirmed that he was glad that Craven proved him wrong about the scene. Dimension Films head Bob Weinstein realized while reviewing the script that there were thirty pages (approximately thirty on-screen minutes) without a murder, so he instructed Williamson to have another character killed.|$|E
