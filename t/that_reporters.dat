5|$|An {{undertaking}} of {{the restoration}} team was {{that everything would}} be handled in a transparent fashion, <b>that</b> <b>reporters,</b> art historians and others with a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, Nippon Television Network Corporation, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of {{the restoration of the}} ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{during this}} time {{purchased}} the property in Mentor <b>that</b> <b>reporters</b> later dubbed Lawnfield, and from which he would conduct the first successful front porch campaign for the presidency. Hayes suggested that Garfield run for governor in 1879, seeing that as a road that would likely put Garfield in the White House. Garfield preferred to seek election as senator, and devoted his efforts to seeing that Republicans won the 1879 election for the General Assembly, with the likely Democratic candidate the incumbent, Allen G. Thurman. The Republicans swept the legislative elections. Rivals were spoken of for the seat, such as Secretary Sherman, but he had presidential ambitions (for which he sought Garfield's support), and other candidates fell by the wayside. Garfield {{was elected to the}} Senate by the General Assembly in January 1880, though his term was not to begin until March 4, 1881.|$|E
25|$|In January 2002, the {{partially}} nude female {{statue of the}} Spirit of Justice, which stands in the Great Hall of the Justice Department, where Ashcroft held press conferences, was covered with blue curtains, along with its male counterpart, the Majesty of Justice. Some speculated that Ashcroft thought <b>that</b> <b>reporters</b> were photographing him with the female statue in the background {{to make fun of}} his church's opposition to pornography. A Justice Department spokeswoman said that Ashcroft knew nothing of the decision to spend $8,000 for the curtains; a spokesman said the decision for permanent curtains was intended to save on the $2,000 per use rental costs of temporary curtains used for formal events.|$|E

25|$|Minister of the Interior Otar Khetsia stated on 21 November that {{criminal}} cases had been opened {{by law enforcement}} agencies in Gagra and Aradu. He noted that Azhiba's car had stood along the road at a far distance from his home, and while he confirmed that fire had broken out, he cautioned that {{it was up to}} the investigation to establish whether the car had exploded or been set fire to. Khetsia also confirmed that a warehouse for kiwifruit had burned down in Aradu, and that everything would be done to find the perpetrators, but he expressed his surprise at the fact <b>that</b> <b>reporters</b> from Abaza TV (owned by Butba) had been at the crime scene before officers from the Ochamchira police department.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{theories}} proposed include FBI incompetence, that Syria or Iraq {{directed the}} attacks, or that similar to some 9/11 conspiracy theories the U.S. government knew {{in advance that}} the attacks would occur. Senator Patrick Leahy who is Senate Judiciary Committee chairman and who had received an anthrax-tainted letter, said the FBI has not produced convincing evidence in the case. The Washington Post called for an independent investigation in the case saying <b>that</b> <b>reporters</b> and scientists were poking holes in the case. Had both attacks on the senators succeeded in killing their targets, the result {{would have been a}} Republican majority in the Senate, in the immediate future because of the loss of two Democrats, and in the long term, as the governors of the targets' states would have been likely to name Republican replacements. This suggests that right-wing extremists had an incentive to carry out the attacks.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Wilcher {{published}} a lesson plan for early childhood activities, A Musical Offering. By the late 1990s, for reasons not entirely clear, The Wiggles {{had not only}} rerecorded their first album, but also renamed it [...] "Wiggle Time" [...] and removed all of his compositions. In 2005, when The Wiggles had become Australia's most successful children's act, he seemed to criticise The Wiggles in the press, but he has since recanted, stating <b>that</b> <b>reporters</b> had misrepresented him and that he chose to remain silent {{in the aftermath of}} their articles.|$|E

500|$|Status {{hearings}} {{in the case}} were held in June and November 2016, and the discovery process was ongoing as of November. In February 2017, a judge set a late April 2017 trial date, and Feit remained under medical supervision at the Hidalgo County Jail. In April, Feit's defense filed {{for a change of}} venue because they believed that their client would not receive a fair and impartial trial in the Hidalgo County. They filed a 700-page document with evidence showing <b>that</b> <b>reporters</b> allegedly condemned Feit as a murderer, and that the only reason why he avoided prosecution for years was because the Catholic Church protected him. Sometime in March, Tacheny testified against Feit in closed deposition. This was permitted under Texas law given the witness' age and exclusive knowledge of the case.|$|E
500|$|Jefferies gave {{evidence}} to the Leveson Inquiry, established by Prime Minister David Cameron to investigate the ethics and behaviour of the British media following the News of the World phone hacking affair. [...] Jefferies told the inquiry <b>that</b> <b>reporters</b> had [...] "besieged" [...] him after he was questioned by the police; he said: [...] "It {{was clear that the}} tabloid press had decided that I was guilty of Miss Yeates' murder and seemed determined to persuade the public of my guilt. They embarked on a frenzied campaign to blacken my character by publishing a series of very serious allegations about me which were completely untrue." [...] Appearing before the same inquiry on 16 January 2012, the Daily Mirror editor, Richard Wallace, described the newspaper's coverage of Jefferies' arrest as a [...] "black mark" [...] on his editing record.|$|E
500|$|As former Vice President Richard Nixon {{gained the}} Republican Party nomination, Humphrey held {{what he thought}} was a private meeting with 23 college {{students}} in his office. There, he candidly discussed his thoughts about the political climate, unaware <b>that</b> <b>reporters</b> were also in the room and that his statements would become public. Humphrey remarked that youths were using the Vietnam War as [...] "escapism" [...] and ignoring domestic issues. He stated that he had received thousands of letters from young people about the Vietnam War but received zero about Head Start as part of the program designed for poor preschool children began to expire, which he saved with a tie-breaking Senate vote. As the national convention approached with Humphrey's likely nomination, the war continued to divide the party and set the stage for a battle in Chicago, Humphrey hoped to move the convention to Miami to escape a vitriolic venue, but President Johnson vetoed the idea.|$|E

500|$|The 32X was {{released}} on November 21, 1994 in North America, {{in time for the}} holiday season that year. [...] As announced, it retailed for $159.99, and had a reasonably successful launch in the marketplace. [...] Demand among retailers was high, and Sega could not keep up orders for the system. [...] Over 1,000,000 orders had been placed for 32X units, but Sega had only managed to ship 600,000 units by January 1995. [...] Launching at about the same price as a Genesis console, the price of the 32X was less than half of what the Saturn's price would be at launch. Despite Sega's initial promises, only six titles were available at its North American launch, including Doom, Star Wars Arcade, Virtua Racing Deluxe, and Cosmic Carnage. Although Virtua Racing was considered a [...] "strong" [...] title, Cosmic Carnage [...] "looked and played so poorly <b>that</b> <b>reporters</b> made jokes about it." [...] Games were available at a retail price of $69.95. [...] Advertising for the system included images of the 32X being connected to a Genesis console to create an [...] "arcade system". [...] Japan received the 32X on December 3, 1994, at a cost of JP¥16,800. [...] The system's PAL release came in January 1995, at a price of GB£169.99, and also experienced initial high demand.|$|E

Reporters were guided to burned streets in Lhasa hung with a red banner that read, [...] "Construct a Socialist Harmonious Society," [...] a catchphrase from the Chinese president's efforts to deal with social unrest created by an increasing gap between an urban middle class and the poor.
