5|$|One species, {{the cattle}} egret, was {{historically}} an African bird. In the 20th century this bird colonized North America {{and is now}} found throughout the lower 48 states of the United States. The cattle egret is the only Old World bird to establish itself in North America in historical times without being introduced by humans. As such, it is not marked as introduced on this list. Neither is <b>the</b> <b>glossy</b> ibis, which probably had a similar history.|$|E
5|$|Slender {{with thin}} legs {{and a short}} tail, the four-horned {{antelope}} has a yellowish brown to reddish coat. The underparts and the insides of the legs are white. Facial features include black markings on the muzzle and behind the ears. A black stripe marks the outer surface of each leg. Females have four teats far back on the abdomen. The hair feels coarse, more {{like that of a}} deer than <b>the</b> <b>glossy</b> hair typical of antelopes. The fetlocks are marked with white patches.|$|E

5|$|The 1967 film An Evening in Paris {{is mostly}} remembered because it {{featured}} Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore {{as the first}} Indian actress to wear a bikini on film. She also posed in a bikini for <b>the</b> <b>glossy</b> Filmfare magazine. The costume shocked a conservative Indian audience, but it also {{set in motion a}} trend carried forward by Zeenat Aman in Heera Panna (1973) and Qurbani (1980), Dimple Kapadia in Bobby (1973), and Parveen Babi in Yeh Nazdeekiyan (1982).|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop can be {{distinguished}} from its close relative the Pacific pink scallop (Chlamys rubida) by the valves being less rounded and by the small curved spines on the ribs which give it a rough texture whereas the Pacific pink feels smooth. <b>The</b> <b>glossy</b> white interior of the spiny scallop's shell often has a purplish blotch near the umbone, not present in the Pacific pink.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} {{is distinguished}} from other dark-plumaged birds by its yellow tail and ear markings, and its contact call. Parts of its range overlap with the ranges of two cockatoo species that have red tail banding, the red-tailed cockatoo and <b>the</b> <b>glossy</b> black cockatoo. Crow species may appear similar when seen flying at a distance; however, crows have shorter tails, a quicker wing beat, and different calls.|$|E

5|$|While the MacBook Pro largely {{followed}} the industrial design standard {{set by the}} PowerBook G4, the MacBook was Apple's first notebook to use features now standard in its notebooks – <b>the</b> <b>glossy</b> display, the sunken keyboard design and the non-mechanical magnetic latch. With the late 2007 revision, the keyboard received several changes to closely mirror the one which shipped with the iMac, by adding the same keyboard short-cut to control multimedia, and removing the embedded numeric keypad and the Apple logo from the command keys.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the American ornithologist Dean Amadon {{suggested}} that Sturnus-like species could have arrived in Africa, and {{given rise to}} the wattled starling (Creatophora cinerea) and the Mascarene starlings. According to Amadon, the Rodrigues and hoopoe starlings were related to Asiatic starlings, such as some species of Sturnus, rather than <b>the</b> <b>glossy</b> starlings (Lamprotornis) of Africa and the Madagascan starling (Saroglossa aurata); he concluded this based on the colouration of the birds. A 2008 study, which analysed the DNA of various starlings, confirmed that the hoopoe starling was a starling, but with no close relatives among the sampled species.|$|E
5|$|Rarely cultivated, Banksia ilicifolia {{requires}} a sunny position and sandy well-drained soil to do well. A slow-growing plant, it takes {{up to ten}} years to flower from seed. <b>The</b> <b>glossy</b> green foliage and long flowering period, combined with prominently displayed flowers give it horticultural potential, although its prickly foliage makes fallen leaves a problem if planted near lawns or walkways. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 22 to 41 days to germinate. Difficulties in collection and low seed set make seed relatively expensive. Seeds are often eaten by insects {{before they can be}} collected.|$|E

5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon and little eagle {{have been reported}} taking galahs and the wedge-tailed eagle has been observed killing a sulphur-crested cockatoo. Eggs and nestlings are vulnerable to many hazards. Various species of monitor lizard (Varanus) are able to climb trees and enter hollows. Other predators recorded include the spotted wood owl on Rasa Island in the Philippines; the amethystine python, black butcherbird and rodents including the giant white-tailed rat in Cape York; and brushtail possum on Kangaroo Island. Furthermore, galahs and little corellas competing for nesting space with <b>the</b> <b>glossy</b> black cockatoo on Kangaroo Island have been recorded killing nestlings of the latter species there. Severe storms may also flood hollows drowning the young and termite or borer activity {{may lead to the}} internal collapse of nests.|$|E
5|$|The spire is a {{protruding}} part of {{the shell}} that includes all of the whorls except the largest and final whorl (known as the body whorl). It is usually more elongated than in other strombid snails, such as the closely related and larger goliath conch, Lobatus goliath that is endemic to Brazil. In L.gigas, <b>the</b> <b>glossy</b> finish or glaze around the aperture of the adult shell is primarily in pale shades of pink. It may show a cream, peach or yellow colouration, {{but it can also}} sometimes be tinged with a deep magenta, shading almost to red. The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost {{part of the}} shell surface, is thin and a pale brown or tan colour.|$|E
5|$|Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore {{appeared}} in a bikini in An Evening in Paris (1967), a film mostly remembered for the first bikini appearance of an Indian actress. She also posed in a bikini for <b>the</b> <b>glossy</b> Filmfare magazine. The costume shocked the conservative Indian audience, but it also set a trend of bikini-clad actresses carried forward by Parveen Babi (in Yeh Nazdeekiyan, 1982), Zeenat Aman (in Heera Panna 1973; Qurbani, 1980) and Dimple Kapadia (in Bobby, 1973) in the early 1970s. Wearing a bikini put her name in the Indian press as one of Bollywood's ten hottest actresses of all time, and was a transgression of female identity through {{a reversal of the}} state of modesty, which functions as a signifier of femininity in Bombay films. By 2005, it became usual for actors in Indian films to change outfits a dozen times in a single song — starting with a chiffon sari and ending up wearing a bikini. But, when Tagore was the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification in 2005, she expressed concerns about the rise of the bikini in Indian films.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos {{occupy a}} wide range of {{habitats}} from forests in subalpine regions to mangroves. However, no species is found in all types of habitat. The most widespread species, such as the galah and cockatiel, are open-country specialists that feed on grass seeds. They are often highly mobile fast flyers and are nomadic. Flocks of birds move across large areas of the inland, locating and feeding on seed and other food sources. Drought may force flocks from more arid areas to move further into farming areas. Other cockatoo species, such as <b>the</b> <b>glossy</b> black cockatoo, inhabit woodlands, rainforests, shrublands and even alpine forests. The red-vented cockatoo inhabits mangroves and its absence from northern Luzon {{may be related to the}} lack of mangrove forests there. Forest-dwelling cockatoos are generally sedentary, as the food supply is more stable and predictable. Several species have adapted well to human modified habitats and are found in agricultural areas and even busy cities.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles {{resemble}} adults, {{but lack}} throat hackles, and sometimes have a pink fleshy gape. The bill is shorter and shallower; its base can be pinkish and the tip can be light grey. The plumage is more ruffled and softer in appearance, lacks <b>the</b> <b>glossy</b> highlights and often having a brown tinge. The bare {{skin on the}} throat is pink in bird that have recently left the nest. Eye colour varies with age, gradually lightening from juvenile to adult. Nestlings up to four months old have blue-grey irises, juveniles aged from four to fifteen months have dark brown irises, and immature birds have hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months. Immature birds older than one year develop hackles, while some pink remains in the gape until the bird is {{two or three years}} of age.|$|E
5|$|While some {{cockatoos}} are generalists {{taking a}} wide range of foods, others are specialists. <b>The</b> <b>glossy</b> black cockatoo specialises in the cones of trees of the genus Allocasuarina, preferring a single species, A. verticillata. It holds the cones in its foot and shreds them with its powerful bill before removing the seeds with its tongue. Some species take large numbers of insects, particularly when breeding; in fact the bulk of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo's diet is made up of insects. The large bill is used in order to extract grubs and larvae from rotting wood. The amount of time cockatoos have to spend foraging varies with the season. During times of plenty they may need to feed for only a few hours in the day, in the morning and evening, then {{spend the rest of the}} day roosting or preening in trees, but during the winter most of the day may be spent foraging. The birds have increased nutritional requirements during the breeding season, so they spend more time foraging for food during this time. Cockatoos have large crops, which allow them to store and digest food for some time after retiring to a tree. During hard times, the cockatoos also display versatility in their diet, travelling widely in order to find food, feeding on more green plant material and in some species using their large bills to dig up corms.|$|E
