40|$|Abstract: A new {{practical}} {{modal balancing}} technique, which uses the modal ratio among mea-surement points (MRMP coeYcient), has been developed. This new method is an improvement upon traditional modal balancing when the rotor {{to be balanced}} operates at the speed between the ®rst and second critical speeds. The concept of the MRMP coeYcient is introduced for the ®rst time in this paper, {{on the basis of}} which the rotor±bearing system can be balanced at any one rotational speed between the ®rst and second critical speeds by decomposing the modal components of unbalance and response simultaneously. Moreover, only one test run is required in three of the four balancing schemes provided in this paper to balance the rotor. In the new method, the <b>test</b> <b>weights</b> need not be orthogonal, so prior modal function knowledge is not necessary for calculation of the <b>test</b> <b>weights,</b> as required in the traditional modal balancing method. To verify the validity of the new technique, a balancing experiment using a rotating cantilever rotor is carried out.

40|$|Both {{drought and}} heat stress are {{responsible}} for decline in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production in many regions of the world. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted increase in these areas. Development of heat and drought tolerant genotypes is on priority.

Twenty-five wheat genotypes were evaluated in irrigated timely, rainfed timely and irrigated late sown conditions for 2 yr using 10 agronomic traits for their response to drought and heat stress and four stress indices (stress susceptibility index, stress tolerance index, mean productivity, and stress tolerance) were calculated.
