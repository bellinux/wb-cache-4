40|$|The {{recognition}} of a cluster of antibiotic-associated nosocomial Clostridium difficile disease (NCDD) caused by serotype C in a surgical ward led to a hospital-wide NCDD surveillance and control program. The initial step included: (a) gas-liquid chromatography screening of inpatients' diarrheal stools; (b) enteric isolation precautions, cohorting and <b>terminal</b> <b>room</b> disinfection in wards with a cluster {{of two or more}} NCDD cases per month. During a 12 -month period, the quarterly incidence of NCDD remained unchanged and six new clusters of serotype C, K, and H infections occurred, giving a global incidence of 1. 5 / 1, 000 admissions. C. difficile spores were recovered from 36. 7 % surfaces of case patient rooms versus 6. 7 % in control rooms. More intensive control measures were evaluated: (a) culture screening of inpatients' diarrheal stools; (b) early therapy, enteric isolation precautions, and daily meticulous room disinfection for each sporadic NCDD case. Surface disinfection reduced the contamination level four-fold (p = 0. 04). In the following 12 months, no cluster occurred and the incidence of NCDD fell to 0. 3 / 1, 000 admission (protective efficacy 73 %, 95 % confidence interval: 46 - 87 %). These observations suggest that early therapy, isolation precautions, and surface disinfection, focused on patients with sporadic NCDD detected by active surveillance, can prevent nosocomial transmission of C. difficile...|$|E
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{evidence}} that transmission of many healthcare acquired pathogens (HAPs) is related to contamination of near-patient surfaces and equipment, all hospitals are encouraged to develop programs to optimize the thoroughness of high touch surface cleaning as part of <b>terminal</b> <b>room</b> cleaning at the time of discharge or transfer of patients. Since dedicated resources to implement objective monitoring programs may need to be developed, hospitals can initially implement a basic or Level I program, the elements of which are outlined below. Some hospitals should consider implementing the advanced or Level II program from the start, particularly those with increased rates of infection caused by healthcare acquired pathogens (e. g., high Clostridium difficile infection rate). All hospitals that have successfully achieved a Level I program should advance to Level II. At present, the objective monitoring of the cleaning process of certain high touch surfaces (e. g., the curtain that separates patient beds) beyond those outlined in the attached checklist is not well defined. Additionally, there is no standard method for measuring actual cleanliness of surfaces or the achievement of certain cleaning parameters (e. g., adequate contact time of disinfectant) or for defining the level of microbial contamination that correlates with good or poor environmental hygienic practices. As our understanding of these issues evolve and a standardization of assessment in these respective areas can be developed and practically implemented, hospitals that have obtained a high compliance rate with surface cleaning as outlined in the Level II program are encouraged to advance their efforts in optimizing environmental hygienic practices.

40|$|OBJECTIVETo {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} an automated ultraviolet-C (UV-C) emitter against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Clostridium difficile, and Acinetobacter spp. in patient rooms. DESIGNProspective cohort study. SETTINGTwo tertiary care hospitals. PARTICIPANTSConvenience sample of 39 patient rooms from which a patient infected or colonized with 1 of the 3 targeted pathogens had been discharged. INTERVENTIONEnvironmental sites were cultured before and after use of an automated UV-C-emitting device in targeted rooms but before standard <b>terminal</b> <b>room</b> disinfection by environmental services. RESULTSIn total, 142 samples were obtained from 27 rooms of patients who were colonized or infected with VRE, 77 samples were obtained from 10 rooms of patients with C. difficile infection, and 10 samples were obtained from 2 rooms of patients with infections due to Acinetobacter. Use of an automated UV-C-emitting device led to {{a significant decrease in}} the total number of colony-forming units (CFUs) of any type of organism (1. 07 log 10 reduction; P <. 0001), CFUs of target pathogens (1. 35 log 10 reduction; P <. 0001), VRE CFUs (1. 68 log 10 reduction; P <. 0001), and C. difficile CFUs (1. 16 log 10 reduction; P <. 0001). CFUs of Acinetobacter also decreased (1. 71 log 10 reduction), but the trend was not statistically significant (P =. 25). CFUs were reduced at all 9 of the environmental sites tested. Reductions similarly occurred in direct and indirect line of sight. CONCLUSIONSOur data confirm that automated UV-C-emitting devices can decrease the bioburden of important pathogens in real-world settings such as hospital rooms.

40|$|The most {{efficient}} approach to monitoring and improving cleaning outcomes remains unresolved. We sought {{to extend the}} findings of a previous study by determining whether cleaning thoroughness (dye removal) correlates with cleaning efficacy (absence of molecular or cultivable biomaterial) and whether one brief educational intervention improves cleaning outcomes. Before-after trial. Newly built community hospital. 90 minute training refresher with surface-specific performance results. Dye removal, measured by fluorescence, and biomaterial removal and acquisition, measured with culture and culture-independent PCR-based assays, were clandestinely assessed for eight consecutive months. At this midpoint, results were presented to the cleaning staff (intervention) and assessments continued for another eight consecutive months. 1273 surfaces were sampled before and after <b>terminal</b> <b>room</b> cleaning. In the short-term, dye removal increased from 40. 3 % to 50. 0 % (not significant). For the entire study period, dye removal also improved but not significantly. After the intervention, the number of rooms testing positive for specific pathogenic species by culturing decreased from 55. 6 % to 36. 6 % (not significant), and those testing positive by PCR fell from 80. 6 % to 53. 7 % (P = 0. 016). For nonspecific biomaterial on surfaces: a) removal of cultivable Gram-negatives (GN) trended toward improvement (P = 0. 056); b) removal of any cultivable growth was unchanged but acquisition (detection of biomaterial on post-cleaned surfaces that were contaminant-free before cleaning) worsened (P = 0. 017); c) removal of PCR-based detection of bacterial DNA improved (P = 0. 046), but acquisition worsened (P = 0. 003); d) cleaning thoroughness and efficacy were not correlated.
