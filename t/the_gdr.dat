5|$|Due to a quirk in legislation, the West Berlin {{parts of}} the Stadtbahn belonged to the Deutsche Reichsbahn, which made it (and {{therefore}} <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> government) {{one of the largest}} landowners in West Berlin. Regular quarrels erupted between the DR, <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> government, the West Berlin Senate and the Allied occupation powers.|$|E
5|$|The time of Rau's German Economic Commission {{ended in}} October 1949 with the {{establishment}} of the East German state, the German Democratic Republic (GDR). <b>The</b> <b>GDR</b> was proclaimed on 7October 1949, at a ceremony in the former Air Ministry Building in Berlin, until then the seat of Rau's organisation. Five days later, the DWK was formally abolished on 12October 1949. Rau thereupon became a delegate of the People's Chamber, the newly established parliament of <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> and joined the new government.|$|E

5|$|In 1974–75, the {{reception}} and meeting rooms were further upgraded with {{extensive use of}} imported goods from the West. However, over time, Altes Stadthaus became less important to <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> government. Important events, celebrations and ceremonies {{took place in the}} Rotes Rathaus, the Palace of the Republic or the State Council Building. The historical high point {{in the use of the}} building under <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> came in its final phase, when the only freely elected government of East Germany, under Lothar de Maizière relocated there. The provisions of the agreement on German reunification were therefore negotiated there.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 1984 {{a treaty}} between <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> and the West Berlin Senate came into force {{and turned over}} the {{responsibility}} for operation of the S-Bahn in West Berlin to the West Berlin transport authority, the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe. Soon thereafter, talks with <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> commenced regarding improvements of the Stadtbahn in West Berlin {{as well as the}} modernisation of the Zoologischer Garten station. The Lehrter Stadtbahnhof was also carefully restored to its original 1880s look and became a listed building. In East Berlin, the Ostbahnhof was partially rebuilt and renamed to Hauptbahnhof, in time for the 750th anniversary of Berlin's founding in 1987.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>GDR</b> emblem {{was removed}} from over the main {{entrance}} in 1990, the year of reunification, leaving a dark patch. Following reunification, the Berlin offices of the German Chancellery and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs moved into the building. In January 1993, after a legal decision, the Federal Government returned the building to the Federal State of Berlin, which wished {{to use it for}} its original purpose of city administration. However, it first urgently required refurbishment; under <b>the</b> <b>GDR,</b> upkeep had been neglected and the plumbing facilities, for example, dated in part to the 1920s. Access also needed to be provided for the handicapped.|$|E

5|$|The Schießbefehl was, not surprisingly, very {{controversial}} in the West and was {{singled out for}} criticism by the West Germans. <b>The</b> <b>GDR</b> authorities occasionally suspended the Schießbefehl on occasions when {{it would have been}} politically inconvenient to have to explain dead refugees, such as during a visit to <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> by the French foreign minister in 1985. It was also a problem for many of the East German guards and was the motivating factor behind a number of escapes, when guards facing a crisis of conscience defected because of their unwillingness to shoot fellow citizens.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, Berlin {{had been}} {{divided into four}} sectors {{controlled}} by the Allies: the US, the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France. The sector borders inside the city could in general be used freely for passage out of the German Democratic Republic, even after {{the border between the}} Federal Republic of Germany and <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> had been continually closed off, starting in 1952. The outer border of West Berlin, which was also the border between West-Berlin and <b>the</b> <b>GDR,</b> had also been closed down in 1952. During the night of 12 to 13 August 1961 the National People's Army, the German Border Police, the Volkspolizei and the Combat Groups of the Working Class locked down all passages between the Soviet sector and the three West sectors; construction of border protection facilities began.|$|E
5|$|From 18 May 1952, {{when all}} Berlin {{terminal}} stations {{and all other}} long-distance stations in West Berlin were closed, the station Zoologischer Garten remained the only long-distance station for {{the western part of}} the city.

50|$|Although {{in the end}} {{political}} circumstances led to {{the collapse}} of the SED regime, <b>the</b> <b>GDR's</b> growing international (hard currency) debts were leading towards an international debt crisis within a year or two. Debts continued to grow {{in the course of the}} 1980s to over DM40 bn owed to western institutions, a sum not astronomical in absolute terms (<b>the</b> <b>GDR's</b> GDP was perhaps DM250bn) but much larger in relation to <b>the</b> <b>GDR's</b> capacity to export sufficient goods to the west to provide the hard currency to service these debts. An October 1989 paper prepared for the Politburo (Schürer-Papier, after its principal author Gerhard Schürer) projected a need to increase export surplus from around DM2bn in 1990 to over DM11bn by 1995 in order to stabilise debt levels.|$|R
5|$|It {{is still}} not certain how many people died on the inner German border or who they all were, as <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> treated such {{information}} as a closely guarded secret. But estimates have risen steadily since unification, as evidence has been gathered from East German records. As of 2009, unofficial estimates are up to 1,100people, though officially released figures give a count from 270 up to 421 deaths.|$|E
5|$|The East German {{government}} {{sought to}} define {{the country as a}} legitimate state in its own right and portrayed West Germany as enemy territory (feindliches Ausland)– a capitalist, semi-fascist state that exploited its citizens, sought to regain the lost territories of the Third Reich, and stood opposed to the peaceful socialism of <b>the</b> <b>GDR.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>GDR</b> {{implemented}} {{a variety of}} security measures along its Baltic coastline to hinder escape attempts. Camping and access to boats was severely limited and 27 watchtowers were built along the Baltic coastline. If a suspected escape attempt was spotted, high-speed patrol boats would be dispatched to intercept the fugitives. Armed patrols equipped with powerful mobile searchlights monitored the beaches.|$|E

5|$|Czechoslovakia's {{hardline}} {{communist government}} agreed {{to close its}} border with East Germany to choke off the exodus. The closure produced uproar across East Germany and <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> government's bid to humiliate refugees by expelling them from the country in sealed trains backfired disastrously. Torn-up identity papers and East German passports littered the tracks as the refugees threw {{them out of the}} windows. When the trains passed through Dresden, 1,500East Germans stormed the main railway station in an attempt to board. Dozens were injured and the station concourse was virtually destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Berlin's public {{prosecution}} department rendered {{this incident}} assistance in emergency and self-defence in {{consequence of the}} police officer stating that he felt his life being threatened. In many cases West Berliner rescuers {{were not able to}} reach wounded persons because they were either on GDR territory or in East Berlin. They had no authorization to set foot into this territory, so that a trespassing would have been life-endangering for the rescue workers. The four children Çetin Mert, Cengaver Katrancı, Siegfried Kroboth and Giuseppe Savoca, who fell into the Spree at the Gröben riverside between the years 1972 and 1975, could not be rescued even though West Berlin rescue forces arrived quickly on site. In April 1983 the transit passenger Rudolf Burkert {{died of a heart attack}} during an interrogation at the border checkpoint Derwitz. During a subsequent autopsy in West Germany several external injuries were detected, so that an external forceful impact could not be ruled out as the cause of death. This lethal incident resulted not only in negative press reports but also led to an intervention by Helmut Kohl and Franz Josef Strauss. For the imminent public-sector loans they imposed on <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> the condition to conduct humane border controls. Two further deaths of West Germans in transit traffic, shortly after Burkert's death, set off demonstrations against <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> regime and a broad media discussion. In the period that followed inspections decreased in transit traffic.|$|E
5|$|Renovation {{began in}} 1994 under the {{direction}} of architect Gerhard Spangenberg, with the objective of returning the building so far as possible to its original condition while not ignoring the events of the more recent past. The first priority was the removal of iron girders, particle board, and chipboards. Relics of <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> period deemed worthy of preservation were placed either in the Museum of German History in the former Prussian arsenal or in the House of History in Bonn. The original murals and reliefs, painted over and enclosed during <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> period, were then restored. The fountain in the Klosterstraße vestibule was accurately recreated. Four bronze bear sculptures by Ignatius Taschner were returned from the Märkisches Museum and reinstalled on replacement stone columns in the Judenstraße vestibule. Exterior restoration of the building required either restoration or replacement with replicas of some 180 sculptural elements from the tower, including the allegorical figures of the virtues, giant vases, window embrasures, and one of the columns, which had bomb damage and had merely been patched. In addition, the original mansard roof was reconstructed in 1998/99 on the west, main facade facing Jüdenstraße. The technical facilities were also updated, including ventilation equipment, elevators, lighting, and plumbing. It proved impossible to use the tower for offices because it lacked the second exit required by safety regulations. This was later rectified by the addition of office space in the roof cavity.|$|E

50|$|The goal of <b>the</b> <b>GDRs</b> {{effort is}} a {{sustainable}} mobilization {{that can be}} accepted as fair around the world. National obligations are calculated as shares of a global obligation that includes adaptation as well as mitigation. The approach here does not traditionally exhibit political realism, for that term is generally understood to imply an approach that starts with what is politically realistic today. <b>The</b> <b>GDRs</b> approach, in contrast, seeks to outline an approach {{that is consistent with}} the requirements of the climate science.|$|R

5|$|The two German governments {{promoted}} {{very different}} views of the border. <b>The</b> <b>GDR</b> saw it as the international frontier of a sovereign state– a defensive rampart against Western aggression. In Grenzer ("Border Guard"), a 1981 East German Army propaganda film, NATO and West German troops and tanks were depicted as ruthless militarists advancing towards East Germany. Border troops interviewed in the film described {{what they saw as}} the rightfulness of their cause and the threat of Western agents, spies and provocateurs. Their colleagues killed on the border were hailed as heroes and schoolchildren in East Berlin were depicted saluting their memorial.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little remains}} of the {{installations}} along the former inner German border. At least 30public, private and municipal museums along the old line present displays of equipment and other artifacts relating to the border. Among the preserved sites are several dozen watchtowers, short stretches of the fence and associated installations (some {{of which have been}} reconstructed), sections of the wall still in situ at Hötensleben and Mödlareuth, and a number of buildings related to the border, such as <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> crossing point at Marienborn.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Second World War, the East German side of {{the border}} was guarded {{initially}} by the Border Troops (Pogranichnyie Voiska) of the Soviet NKVD (later the KGB). They were supplemented from 1946 by a locally recruited paramilitary force, the German Border Police (Deutsche Grenzpolizei or DGP), before the Soviets handed over full control of the border to the East Germans in 1955/56. In 1961, the DGP was converted into a military force within the National People's Army (Nationale Volksarmee, NVA). The newly renamed Border Troops of <b>the</b> <b>GDR</b> (Grenztruppen der DDR, commonly nicknamed the Grenzer) came under the NVA's Border Command or Grenzkommando. They were responsible for securing and defending the borders with West Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Baltic Sea and West Berlin. At their peak, the Grenztruppen had up to 50,000personnel.|$|E
