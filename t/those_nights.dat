25|$|We want {{every man}} and woman in these two {{counties}} to recall the dates of these murders and also to recall whether or not any person close to them was missing or out of pocket during <b>those</b> <b>nights.</b> Persons who have such information and have been withholding it when they know they should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured. Make no mistake {{about the fact that}} the slayer will be captured because we will not give up this hunt until he has been captured or killed. All information received will be treated confidentially. We urge you to come in and tell what you know. Don't be hesitant or fear that you are causing an innocent man embarrassment and trouble in as much all investigation will be confidential. This is no time to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with information that may lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E
500|$|These thirty nights, {{starting}} with the new moon, are divided into eight groups by a [...] "heralding sequence" [...] of four glyphs (above, and colored purple on the tablet at right) which ends in the pictogram of a fish on a line (yellow). The heralding sequences each contain two right-side lunar crescents ("☽"). In all four heralding sequences preceding the full moon the fish is head up; in all four following it the fish is head down, suggesting the waxing and waning of the moon. The way the crescents are grouped together reflects the patterns of names in the old calendar. The two ☾ crescents {{at the end of}} the calendar, introduced with an expanded heralding sequence, represent the two intercalary nights held in reserve. The eleventh crescent, with the bulge, is where one of <b>those</b> <b>nights</b> is found in Thomson's and Métraux's records.|$|E
500|$|A 2005 concert {{version of}} the musical, edited down to two hours, but {{including}} all of the songs and the full musical score, was presented at Carnegie Hall. It starred Reba McEntire as Nellie, Brian Stokes Mitchell as Emile, Alec Baldwin as Billis and Lillias White as Bloody Mary. The production used Robert Russell Bennett's original orchestrations and the Orchestra of St. Luke's directed by Paul Gemignani. [...] It was taped and telecast by PBS in 2006 and released the same year on DVD. The New York Times critic Ben Brantley wrote, [...] "Open-voiced and open-faced, Reba McEntire was born to play Nellie"; the production was received [...] "in a state of nearly unconditional rapture. It was one of <b>those</b> <b>nights</b> when cynicism didn't stand a chance." [...] Kenrick especially likes Mitchell's [...] "This Nearly Was Mine", and praises the concert generally: [...] "this excellent performance helped restore the reputation of this classic".|$|E

In December 2013, the night bicycle squad was dissolved and <b>those</b> <b>night</b> bicycle officers instead reported to patrol supervisors alongside patrol units.

2500|$|During {{the first}} years of the 1980s, the disco sound began to be phased out, and faster tempos and {{synthesized}} effects, accompanied by guitar and simplified backgrounds, moved dance music toward the funk and pop genres. This trend can be seen in singer Billy Ocean's recordings between 1979 and 1981. Whereas Ocean's 1979 song American Hearts was backed with an orchestral arrangement played by the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra, his 1981 song [...] "One of <b>Those</b> <b>Nights</b> (Feel Like Gettin' Down)" [...] had a more bare, stripped-down sound, with no orchestration or symphonic arrangements. This drift from the original disco sound is called post-disco. In this music scene there are rooted subgenres, such as Italo disco, techno, house, dance-pop, boogie, and early alternative dance. During the early 1980s, dance music dropped the complicated song structure and orchestration that typified the disco sound.|$|E

He had committed a breach of discipline, and a breach of trust. In plainer words, he had deserted his post.|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} problem of night pain {{and the use of}} {{hypnotic}} drugs in patients with rheumatic diseases 165 consecutive patients (mean age 58. 5 years) were assessed and questioned about night pain and the use of drugs including night sedation. Most of the patients (106 (64 %)) were women. A total of 32 (19 %) patients were receiving night sedation for a mean duration of 43. 9 months. Fourteen patients (13 women) were using these drugs to treat insomnia related to pain. The mean visual analogue pain score for night pain showed a significant difference between <b>those</b> receiving <b>night</b> sedation (5. 2) and those who were not (3. 7). Of the 70 patients who answered the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), <b>those</b> receiving <b>night</b> sedation also had a significantly higher mean score (1. 91) than those who were not (1. 2), suggesting that patients receiving night sedation were more clinically disabled. Codeine was used by more (34 %) patients receiving <b>night</b> sedation than <b>those</b> who were not (18 %) suggesting that <b>those</b> receiving <b>night</b> sedation had more pain. These results highlight the need for better pain management in patients with rheumatic diseases to minimise the risk of prescribing addictive drugs such as hypnotic drugs and codeine...|$|R

Page is seen wearing a different dragon suit in [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] and the [...] "Celebration Day" [...] remaster. In an interview from 1997 Jones said that the reason he didn't wear the same stage clothes was that he asked the crew if they would be filming on <b>those</b> <b>nights</b> and was told no.

In a start against the Colorado Springs Sky Sox in late May, Cruceta pitched eight shutout innings, allowing two hits and no walks while striking out 11. Cruceta continued to pitch strongly, but was passed over for the PCL All-Star team, a decision criticized by the Rainiers' manager, Dave Brundage, who called Cruceta [...] "dominant" [...] {{and said that he}} had been [...] "snubbed." [...] The Mariners called Cruceta up in September to make a spot start, but he did not get out of the first inning against the Kansas City Royals, giving up five runs, including a grand slam, in one inning of work. Commented Mariners' manager Mike Hargrove: [...] "It was one of <b>those</b> <b>nights.</b> He'll pitch again. Out of the bullpen." [...] Cruceta made three relief appearances, giving up three runs in five innings of work, {{but at the end of}} the year waived him.
