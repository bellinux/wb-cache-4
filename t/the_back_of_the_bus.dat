5|$|An {{event on}} July 6, 1944 derailed Robinson's {{military}} career. While awaiting results of hospital {{tests on the}} ankle he had injured in junior college, Robinson boarded an Army bus with a fellow officer's wife; although the Army had commissioned its own unsegregated bus line, the bus driver ordered Robinson to move to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus.</b> Robinson refused. The driver backed down, but after reaching {{the end of the}} line, summoned the military police, who took Robinson into custody. When Robinson later confronted the investigating duty officer about racist questioning by the officer and his assistant, the officer recommended Robinson be court-martialed. After Robinson's commander in the 761st, Paul L. Bates, refused to authorize the legal action, Robinson was summarily transferred to the 758th Battalion—where the commander quickly consented to charge Robinson with multiple offenses, including, among other charges, public drunkenness, even though Robinson did not drink.|$|E
25|$|In Orthodox Judaism, {{there are}} certain {{situations}} in which gender separation is practiced for religious and social reasons, with strict rules on mingling of men and women. Before they were banned in 2011, Mehadrin bus lines operated along routes with large Haredi populations, with seats in the front reserved for men passengers. In 2006, Miriam Shear, an American Jewish woman, claims she was attacked by ultra-Orthodox men after refusing to move to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> on a non-segregated line. Critics likened the “mehadrin” lines to racial segregation in the United States, with Shear compared to African American icon Rosa Parks. In July 2004, American-Israeli novelist Naomi Ragen claims she was bullied for refusing to move to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus.</b>|$|E

Though Woodard had caused no disruption, the driver {{contacted}} {{the local police}} (including Chief of Police Lynwood Shull), who forcibly removed Woodard from the bus. After demanding to see his discharge papers, a number of policemen, including Shull, took Woodard to a nearby alleyway, where they beat him repeatedly with nightsticks. They then took Woodard to the town jail and arrested him for disorderly conduct, accusing him of drinking beer in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> with other soldiers.|$|E

Living under Jim Crow segregation laws, Jackson was taught to go to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> and use separate water fountains – practices he accepted until the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955. He attended the racially segregated Sterling High School in Greenville, where he was elected student class president, finished tenth in his class, and earned letters in baseball, football and basketball.|$|E
500|$|The whole bus-crash {{sequence}} was storyboarded. Greg Yaitanes described stunt-coordinator Jim Vickers as [...] "crucial" [...] for {{the filming}} of this sequence. The bus crash scene was filmed in a studio using a big spinning wheel (which Anne Dudek {{referred to as a}} [...] "gadget"). This gadget was mainly <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus,</b> and could be turned 360 degrees to increase the authenticity of the scene. For the rest of the bus, a greenscreen was used that surrounded the complete outside of the bus. The shots involving Anne Dudek were filmed at another time, using light effects and people simulating a bus crash experience in the otherwise motionless gadget.|$|E

She walks {{out of the parking lot}} and into an amusement park, where she stands in front of a carousel in the rain as she continues to sing. After the second chorus, Lovato and her band perform in the rain with the water altering colors in the background. As the last verse approaches, she is back on the tour bus. A single tear rolls down her cheek and the video ends.|$|E

500|$|The riots spawned from a bar raid {{became a}} literal example of {{gays and lesbians}} {{fighting}} back, and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of [...] "exploitation and degradation". The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter insists, is the [...] "ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality". Historian Nicholas Edsall writes, Stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and defiance in American history from the Boston Tea Party on. But the best and certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is with Rosa Parks' refusal to move to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as well.|$|E
500|$|On February 4, 1999, Christopher Drayton and Clifton Brown, Jr. were {{traveling}} on a Greyhound bus bound for Detroit, Michigan. When the bus made a planned stop in Tallahassee, Florida, passengers {{were told to}} get off the bus so it could be cleaned and refueled. After the passengers re-boarded, the driver allowed Officers Blackburn, Hoover, and Lang of the Tallahassee Police Department to enter the bus [...] "as part of a routine drug and weapons interdiction effort". Although the officers displayed visible badges, they carried concealed weapons and were not in uniform. Upon entering the bus, Officer Hoover knelt on the driver's seat, Officer Blackburn stood at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus,</b> and Officer Lang walked along the aisle of the bus to talk to passengers. He asked passengers which luggage was theirs and where they were going. None of the officers blocked the aisle or otherwise obstructed the exit, and passengers were free to leave while the officers conducted their investigation. However, the officers did not inform passengers of their right to refuse to cooperate with the investigation.|$|E
500|$|As Ryan {{headed into}} {{his second year}} as the team's head coach, the club {{announced}} {{he had been given}} a two-year contract extension. Ryan continued to exude confidence in the team, writing on ESPN's training camp tour bus [...] "Soon To Be Champs" [...] in August, referencing that the Jets would make it to the Super Bowl and become the eventual champions. Ryan had been asked to sign the Jets' logo on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> but included the message with his signature. The prediction was met with some criticism while others praised his brashness, something that was felt to be lacking in the NFL at the time. When the team appeared on the television series Hard Knocks that same month, Ryan was criticized, particularly by former head coach Tony Dungy, for his use of foul language. Dungy and Ryan later met in person to reconcile their differences. Ryan's championship claims were nearly proven correct as the Jets opened the season with {{the best record in the}} NFL at 9–2. This set the stage for a Monday Night Football matchup with their division rival, the Patriots, who were also 9–2. The Patriots, behind the strong performance of quarterback Tom Brady, defeated the Jets 45–3. However, the Jets finished the season with an 11–5 record and qualified as a wild card team in the playoffs. The Jets were one win short of tying the franchise record in wins set by the 1998 team led by Bill Parcells.|$|E

2500|$|According to Sharon Eberson of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, [...] "Stargate SG-1's" [...] {{place in}} the sci-fi {{universe}} {{can be measured in}} longevity, spot-on cast chemistry, rabid fans and tough subject it has tackled although she argued that the show was rarely a critical darling. Although the show was the most-watched program on Showtime, it received almost no media mention outside hard-core science fiction circles in its first seasons. Stargate SG-1 gained media attention when Stargate Atlantis was greenlit (the cover of the July 26, 2003 TV Guide issue notably called to [...] "Forget Trek! Stargate SG-1 is now sci-fi's biggest hit!"), but the Toronto Star noted in 2006 that [...] "Nobody seemed to like [...] but the fans; it somehow always slipped under the radar of most TV critics". According to Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, SG-1 records did not earn it [...] "the kind of wide-ranging respect a successful series with a 200-episode run deserves"; SG-1 rarely occupied a slot on 'best show' lists because the show remained [...] "relegated to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> in terms of popularity" [...] behind the glory of Battlestar Galactica, although every week, the show attracts an average of 10 million viewers worldwide. It has also been pointed out by Cooper that [...] "By the way, neither did the original 'Star Trek' in its time, It wasn't until 30 years later that people started looking back at it and realizing it was a milestone. I think we secretly hope that 10, 15, 20 years from now, that 'Stargate' will be considered in the same way." [...] Scott D. Pierce from Deseret News said that the series never made a [...] "sort of cultural impact" [...] as Star Trek because the show was [...] "pretty derivative" [...] which he further stated it became [...] "more so over the years."
