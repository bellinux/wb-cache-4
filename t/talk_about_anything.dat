5|$|The two {{go ahead}} with their plans to meet Alex, who brings along his friend, Junior (Chaddha) to the hotel. The group discuss their lives over supper, which is cut short by an {{argument}} between Alex and Sahil over the former's irresponsible behaviour. The four {{head back to the}} hotel room to collect Sahil's belongings, as Jai plans to leave later that night. Alex notices the guitar and later forces Sahil to play for him, to which Sahil obliges with an original song. Alex dances with Jai, who looks even more impressed with Sahil's artistry. Alex offers to take back Sahil's belongings and give the two some more time together. When he leaves, Sahil and Jai embrace, but do not <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> that had happened.|$|E
500|$|The duo created [...] "Spice Invaders" [...] {{by placing}} four {{microphones}} {{and telling the}} group to just <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> they wanted, the conversation was recorded and as Wilson described it, a [...] "hideous bubblegum" [...] backing track was added behind the voices. After the group left, Watkins and the mix engineer finished the track during the night.|$|E
500|$|After {{expanding}} their musical boundaries with The Hot Rock, the band {{decided not to}} worry about what their next album was going to sound like. Tucker explained, [...] "It was so spontaneous [...] The songs just kept popping up one after another. We didn't really <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything.</b> It just kind of happened." [...] She also said that they wanted to write songs that were [...] "really straightforward but also a bit more mature in their structure and delivery than [...] earlier songs." [...] All Hands on the Bad One is also the first Sleater-Kinney album where drummer Janet Weiss provides backing vocals on some tracks. Tucker remarked that they initially wanted her to sing on The Hot Rock, but the idea was ultimately rejected due to the album's complex melodies. All Hands on the Bad One was produced by John Goodmanson, who previously produced the band's third studio album, Dig Me Out. The band decided to work with him again because, according to Weiss, Goodmanson [...] "has the incredible ability of capturing our live sound and heightening it, so we sound better". The album was recorded from December 1999 to January 2000 at Jackpot! Recording Studio in Portland, Oregon and John & Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington.|$|E
6000|$|... “I’m not <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> {{that belongs}} to Betsy herself,” said Vera darkly; “but, of course, you don’t know what I know, and I don’t suppose I ought to tell you.” ...|$|R
50|$|She has a {{great love}} for mathematics. She is {{normally}} quiet and subdued, but immediately becomes loquacious when she starts to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> math. She rarely <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> else, for example starting her first conversation with the narrator when they meet {{with a series of}} math problems.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, aunt; but pray do not. I don't wish it." [...] Miss Baker {{of course}} obeyed, {{as she always}} did. And so George sat there, <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> or nothing, rather lack-a-daisically, till {{he got up to}} take his leave.|$|R
2500|$|In 1938, {{during a}} meeting with Wilhelm Fabricius, the German ambassador, Cristea praised the anti-semitic policy {{conducted}} by Nazi Germany and supporting such a policy in Romania, and the British Ambassador wrote in his report to London that [...] "Nothing would induce him [...] to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> but the Jewish problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{introduction}} to Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein mentions discussions with Sraffa over many years and says: [...] "I am indebted to this stimulus for the most consequential ideas in this book". In 1946, however, Sraffa broke off his weekly conversations with Wittgenstein over the latter's protests; and when the philosopher said he would <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> Sraffa wanted, [...] "'Yes', Sraffa replied, 'but in your way'".|$|E
2500|$|... "Most movie {{executives}} and producers," [...] said Brooks, [...] "are usually boring and dull, and not well-read. They don't care about art or painting, they just care about profits. But Sidney {{was always an}} artist. You could <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> with him - great literature, life and love." [...] The writer and critic Michael Coveney knew Glazier as demanding , irascible, impatient but full of charm", someone who [...] "epitomised 's spirit of tolerance, intellectual curiosity, fast living and taste for the high life".|$|E
5000|$|Molinari was {{described}} in 2013 as a gifted analyst of the real-estate market, who in a 2004 conversation with Tomás Regalado, later elected mayor of Miami, predicted the mortgage crisis “when nobody was <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> but the euphoria of large investments.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Again, {{the opening}} bars (only) of [...] "TWX in 12 Bars" [...] {{is used for}} the opening, with a quote {{attributed}} to Rukeyser, “This show has never been solely <b>about</b> investments. We've <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> that affected people and their money," [...] with both Scaramucci and Kaminsky featured in the opening.|$|R
5000|$|Too {{much should}} not be read into [...] "disposing of his own lot in life" [...] in the passage as this is not {{necessarily}} <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> other than slavery. Indeed it would be odd if Mill had intended it to be about suicide but not explored the issue fully.|$|R
2500|$|The Tom Leykis Show {{began in}} 1994 {{broadcasting}} from Los Angeles. [...] Originally {{the show was}} often political in nature, a fact Leykis highlighted {{at the start of}} every episode by proclaiming his show the only radio talk show that is [...] "not hosted by a right-wing wacko or a convicted felon", references to radio hosts Rush Limbaugh and G. Gordon Liddy, respectively. In addition to politics, the host commonly discussed relationships, religion (Leykis is an atheist), and other issues. On Fridays, listeners were allowed to call in and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> they wanted, in contrast to other days when Leykis established a single topic for each hour of the show.|$|E
2500|$|It was at {{this time}} that he became {{interested}} in the foundations of mathematics, particularly after reading Bertrand Russell's The Principles of Mathematics (1903), and Gottlob Frege's The Foundations of Arithmetic, vol. 1 (1893) and vol. 2 (1903). Wittgenstein's sister Hermine said he became obsessed with mathematics as a result, and was anyway losing interest in aeronautics. He decided instead that he needed to study logic and the foundations of mathematics, describing himself as in a [...] "constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation." [...] In the summer of 1911 he visited Frege at the University of Jena to show him some philosophy of mathematics and logic he had written, and to ask whether it was worth pursuing. He wrote: [...] "I was shown into Frege's study. Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room as he talked. He absolutely wiped the floor with me, and I felt very depressed; but at the end he said 'You must come again', so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that. Frege would never <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> but logic and mathematics, if I started on some other subject, he would say something polite and then plunge back into logic and mathematics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of this hypervisibility from symbols {{like the}} veil, {{it makes it}} {{difficult}} to talk about the realities of Arab and Arab American women's lives, [...] "without invoking, and necessarily responding to, the looming image and story that the mythology of the veil tells", she goes on to state that the veil is not the only symbol, there are others such as [...] "honor killings" [...] and [...] "stoning". [...] The argument that is being made is that because of these symbols it is hard to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> else that is currently taking place in the lives of Arab and Arab American women. Theses symbols make it difficult to focus on other important issues, however Jarmakani states that because of this hypervisibility Arab feminists can take advantage of it. She builds her argument off of Joe Kadi from her essay, [...] "Speaking about Silence" [...] where Joe argues that those who are silenced or being forced into being silent can break this silence by speaking out. Jarmakani argues that unlike Joe who said one should speak out, Jarmakani is stating to use the silence, meaning that Arab women should use the hypervisibility that is being given by the symbols of invisibility. Jarmakani ends with, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{should be}} thankful {{to him for}} going without making any more of a disturbance. I'm {{relieved}} to know he wasn't seriously hurt, and--How wicked I am to stand here <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything,</b> when your wounds should be attended to! It's a mercy you haven't bled to death long before this." ...|$|R
5000|$|Entering into marifat in Universal Sufism, {{the seeker}} no longer asserts or defines <b>anything.</b> <b>Talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything,</b> such as [...] "the four stages" [...] of realization, {{is of little}} {{interest}} to the Sufi who has reached this stage. Or better said, all conversation topics are of equal interest. The seeker's life is then, itself, revelation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{magazine}} {{had nine}} sections: New Stuff, Tech Girl, Celeb Stuff, Celebs, Look, Fashion, Get Real, Absolutely You, and More. New Stuff was a section that <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> recently released that {{is attractive to}} its readership, such as technology, accessories, clothes, and makeup. The Tech Girl section was specifically about technology, especially [...] "trendy" [...] technology and game reviews.|$|R

60|$|GEO. And yet don't <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> {{long enough}} for it to get embarrassing. Meisterschaft is just splendid for general conversation.|$|E

60|$|Polly {{could not}} help smiling at Tom's new tone, it seemed so strange to hear him <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> but horses and tailors, dancing and girls. She liked it, however, {{as much as she}} did the sober {{expression}} of his face, and the way he had lately of swinging his arms about, {{as if he wanted to}} do something energetic with them.|$|R
5000|$|Mathieson is a divorcé {{with three}} adult children. He was {{previously}} married to Diane Stark, {{with whom he}} had two children. Mathieson also fathered a daughter in his late teens. He started dating Gillard in March 2006 and has remained her partner since. When asked about marriage to Gillard, Mathieson said [...] "We haven't <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> more than being spouses at this stage. Wait and see, I guess." ...|$|R
50|$|Each patient—aside from Madison who wasn’t there—was {{assigned}} to film {{herself with a}} video camera, <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything,</b> like a visual diary, Margaret refused. Madison however, locks herself in her apartment, using a video camera to document herself, similar to {{the girls in the}} mental hospital. Madison vows that if she does not have the answer to her questions and feel more at peace with her life, she will kill herself on the 30th day.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Bender glared as {{with the}} round full force of his pair of motor lamps. [...] "Well, if you're ready to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything,</b> I am. Good-bye, Mr. Crimble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Haven't {{you noticed}} that she often doubles her thumb under her fingers--folds her fist across it--so--especially when anybody <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> alarming? If the {{conversation}} happens to turn on jungle fever, or any subject like that, down goes her thumb instantly, and she clasps her fist over it with a convulsive squeeze. At the same time, too, her face twitches. I know what that trick means. She's horribly afraid of tropical diseases, though she never says so." ...|$|R
50|$|Neil Kinnock, the Welsh Windbag, <b>talking</b> {{for hours}} <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> other than policies.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She never <b>talks</b> much <b>about</b> <b>anything.</b> But {{you may be}} sure it's true. I'll {{tell you}} who told me first, and he is sure to know, because {{he lives in the}} house. It was Peter Veque.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He's quite right," [...] was Hasluck's comment; [...] "that's what I am undoubtedly. Because I can't <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> but shop myself, I think {{everybody}} else is {{the same sort of}} fool." ...|$|E
