5|$|Continuing {{improvements}} in engineering and economics are enabling {{more of the}} renewable resources to be utilised. Fears regarding peak oil and climate change have driven the subject high up <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> and are also encouraging the use of various biofuels. Although the finances of many projects remain either speculative or dependent on market incentives, {{it is probable that}} there has been a significant, and in all likelihood long-term change, in the underpinning economics.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} events in 2006 pushed {{renewable}} energy up <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda,</b> including the US mid-term elections in November, which confirmed clean energy as a mainstream issue. Also in 2006, the Stern Review made a strong economic case for investing in low carbon technologies now, and argued that economic growth need not be incompatible with cutting energy consumption. According to a trend analysis from the United Nations Environment Programme, climate change concerns coupled with recent high oil prices and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.|$|E
5|$|As President, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened {{to divide the}} Union. Debate over the status of slavery in the Mexican Cession dominated <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push {{for the expansion of}} slavery, and he sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue of slavery, he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting the stage for the Compromise of 1850.|$|E

5|$|During {{most of his}} {{own life}} {{conservationism}} wasn't yet on <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda,</b> and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, he photographed sites {{associated}} with the prominent Marxists Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. He also photographed the signs erected by landowners and religious groups, believing that in doing so he was documenting the traces of capitalist society before they would be swept away by socialism. Both in Britain and {{on a visit to}} Germany he photographed pro-fascist and anti-fascist propaganda and graffiti. Like many leftists at the time, he believed that fascism was a temporary, extreme expression of capitalist society that would soon be overcome by socialism. He nevertheless expressed admiration for the German archaeological establishment under the Nazi government, highlighting that the British state lagged far behind in terms of funding excavations and encouraging the study of archaeology in universities; he refrained from commenting on <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> that the Nazis had in promoting archaeology.|$|E
25|$|Croydon's {{growth in}} the 19th century brought the issue of {{incorporation}} back on to <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda,</b> and in 1883 the ancient parish of Croydon, apart from its exclave of Croydon Crook or Selsdon, was created a municipal borough within Surrey. In 1889, because the population was high enough, it was made a county borough, exempt from county administration.|$|E

25|$|The Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) {{showed up}} {{problems}} of the private railway {{to cope with the}} need to move troops quickly, leading to the second Railway Act of 1872.

25|$|Initially, Italy was the European country most {{interested}} in incorporating Tunisia into its sphere of influence. Italy's strong motivation derived from the substantial number of expatriate citizens already resident there, with corresponding business investment, due to its close geography.

25|$|However, Sir Rod later claimed both to {{the press}} and to a {{parliamentary}} select committee that he was quoted out of context in reports at the time, had aimed his comments specifically at speculative MagLev options, and in fact was in favour of using conventional high-speed rail to relieve congestion once existing main lines reached capacity. Nevertheless, enthusiasm for such projects seemed to wane after the report's publication, at least in Westminster.

Chomsky has repeatedly emphasized that the overall framework of US foreign policy {{can be explained by the}} domestic dominance of US business interests and a drive to secure the state capitalist system. Those interests set <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> and the economic goals that aim primarily at US economic dominance.|$|E
25|$|Secularism {{began to}} be {{discussed}} in Portugal back in the 19th century, during the Casino Conferences in 1871, promoted by Antero de Quental. The republican movement associated the Catholic Church with the monarchy, and opposed its influence in Portuguese society. The secularisation of the Republic constituted {{one of the main}} actions to be taken in <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> of the Portuguese Republican Party and the Freemasonry. Monarchists in a last-ditch effort sought to outflank the republicans by enacting anticlerical measures of their own, even enacting a severe restriction on the Jesuits on the day before the revolution.|$|E

25|$|The film {{industry}} in Argentina reached a pinnacle {{in the late}} 1930s and 1940s when an average of forty-two films were produced annually. The films usually included tango, but even when a tango theme was omitted most cinema from this period still included humble heroes and wealthy villains. In these films, it portrayed hard work and poverty as ennobling and depicted the poor as the primary beneficiaries of Juan Perón's economic policies. These films, in part supported by Perón, were {{seen as part of}} <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> of peronism. By supporting a {{film industry}} that attacked greed and supported the working class, Perón was able to influence the attitudes of his constituency to build public appeal.|$|E
25|$|The two World Wars curbed the {{continuous}} expansion that Wallonia had enjoyed up till that time. Towards {{the end of}} the 1950s, things began to change dramatically.

It was the end of an era, and Wallonia has been making efforts to redefine itself. The restoration of economical development is high on <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda,</b> and the government is encouraging development of industries, notably in cutting edge technology and in business parks.

25|$|Plantations stayed off <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> {{until the}} {{appointment}} of Thomas Wentworth, a Privy Councilor of Charles I, {{to the position of}} Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1632. Wentworth's job was to raise revenue for Charles and to cement Royal control over Ireland – which meant, among other things, more plantations, both to raise money and to break the political power of the Irish Catholic gentry. Wentworth confiscated land in Wicklow and planned a full-scale Plantation of Connacht — where all Catholic landowners would lose between a half and a quarter of their estates. The local juries were intimidated into accepting Wentworth's settlement; when a group of Connacht landowners complained to Charles I, Wentworth had them imprisoned. However, settlement proceeded only in County Sligo and County Roscommon.|$|E
