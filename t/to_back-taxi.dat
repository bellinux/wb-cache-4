5000|$|The Cessna {{had been}} cleared by ground control <b>to</b> <b>back-taxi</b> on runway 31 to the end and wait for takeoff clearance. For reasons unknown it {{continued}} beyond this point on taxiway R to runway 30R and held in position there. TWA 427 was cleared by ground control to taxi to runway 30R by crossing runway 30L then down taxiway P to the end. After receiving permission to take off, the copilot initiated the takeoff roll. When the captain called 80 knots an off-duty crewmember in the jumpseat yelled, [...] "There's an airplane!" [...] Braking was immediately initiated and the captain attempted to use the rudder {{to go around the}} Cessna to the left. The jet struck the Cessna on the right side, shearing {{off the top of the}} small plane. The pilot and passenger on the small plane were instantly killed. The captain immediately asked for safety equipment, and passenger evacuation was initiated, resulting in eight minor injuries. Aircraft continued to land on runway 30L and taxi nearby during passenger evacuation. The captain of TWA 427 was Rick Carr, the first officer was Randy Speed, and the ACM was Randy Richardson.|$|E
