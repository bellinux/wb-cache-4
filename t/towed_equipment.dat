5000|$|Following a {{shakedown}} cruise off the Virginia and Maryland coasts, {{the ship}} proceeded through the Panama Canal and berthed at Pipeline Pier in Long Beach, California. For use in her minesweeping operations, the ship carried, on her fantail, towable finned devices called [...] "pigs" [...] {{because of their}} size and shape, plus cables with cutters, plus other devices used for removing and destroying mines, such as acoustical hammer and hedgehog weapons. After the <b>towed</b> <b>equipment</b> cut a mine cable, the mine floated to the surface, where the mine would be exploded by fire from an on-board 20 mm or 40 mm gun.|$|E
40|$|Euphausiid crustaceans, {{commonly}} referred to as krill, are fast-moving, pelagic, exclusively marine, and found in all oceans generally below 50 m. While restricted to only 86 species in two families, the six largest-size species are abundant in higher latitudes and of commercial interest. Assessment of stocks and collection of specimens generally involves location using active-acoustic surveying and <b>towed</b> <b>equipment</b> from research vessels. Capturing live euphausiids for physiological work requires particular care. The appropriate treatment of specimens obtained depends upon the reason for their collection and a range of options are discussed...|$|E
40|$|High Resolution (220 – 1050 Hz) seismic {{acquisition}} performed {{in deep water}} using deep-towed systems provides unrivalled lateral resolution when compared to conventional surface seismic. The lateral resolution of these acquisitions {{is controlled by the}} width of the first Fresnel zone, taking advantage of their positions close to the sea bottom. No current existing deep <b>towed</b> <b>equipment</b> can benefit from seismic imaging processing techniques to improve this resolution as a consequence of positioning inaccuracies. The technological developments of a digital deep-towed multichannel streamer are presented with a particular attention to positioning: each hydrophone incorporates a pitch, roll and heading sensor in order to monitor the constant deformation of the streamer in operation. The sea trials took place in July 2013 in the Mediterranean Sea. Pre-stack depth migration applied to the deep-towed multichannel data illustrates the potential of this emerging methodology in terms of penetration (12 dB improvement in Signal/Noise) and lateral resolution (mean signal wavelength: 3 m) when compared with deep-towed single-channel acquisition...|$|E

40|$|Geoelectrical {{soil mapping}} using contact sensors with mobile arrays is a {{widespread}} method implemented within Precision Agriculture practices since the 1990 s, but only in recent times has it begun to be used extensively {{in the field of}} archeology. Vehicle <b>towed</b> <b>equipment</b> for the automatic recording of apparent electrical resistivity (ERa) are highly adaptable to land plot structure and are able to cover large areas quickly. In this article we will give an overview of a specific experience of ERa mapping at two archaeological sites with the VERIS 3150 system. This is a contact-sensor that provides georeferenced measurements at two different depths (0 – 30 / 0 – 90 [*]cm). The process of capture, refinement and normalization of raw data is explained. The work also deals with interpolation procedures used for the creation of continuous surfaces. Finally some examples are offered regarding the identification of buried archaeological and geomorphological features. ERa maps are integrated in a geographical information system (GIS) environment, in order to provide a more reliable basis for interpretation. The advantage of the VERIS 3150 sensor is stressed, in terms of cost over traditional electrical resistivity/conductivity mapping techniques for the acquisition of high-quality archaeological information.

40|$|Engineering tlie {{cable route}} into the safest route is a {{subjective}} job {{although there are}} certain standard industry rules {{that need to be}} applied. The cable route is planned using charts produced on the survey vessel. Geophysical and geotechnical datasets are studied in detail, to ensure that the route is optimised with regard to steep slopes, unfavourable seabed, seabed debris, and sediment depth. A survey was carried out {{in the southern part of}} the Red Sea, in order to produce a chart upon which the submarine cable route can be engineered. The Red Sea contains very rough topography, which sometimes hamper the data acquisition, interpretation and ultimately the cable route engineering. The charts produced did allow the cable route to be engineered with confidence that once laid it will survive its operational life. However, the multibeam data was processed using the gridding method, which reduced the quality of the data. Also there is a slight lack of confidence in the interpretation of the lithology as no predictions can be made on the mobility of sediments are the chances of a buried cable becoming exposed. With more accurate data, the route may be refined (even by just a small amount) along a shorter route thereby saving on costs from the shorter length of cable and possible avoidance of expensive armour types. Survey methods, which could be carried out in order to reduce dangers to <b>towed</b> <b>equipment,</b> are also discussed. Faculty of Scienc...|$|E
