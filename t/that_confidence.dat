5|$|Individual {{sketches}} and songs were {{cast by the}} production team, sometimes acting on input from the show's stable of performers themselves. While certain roles naturally lent themselves to a particular actor, Norris said <b>that</b> <b>confidence</b> in the entire cast's ability was such that the producers also experimented with casting against type. The demands of filming thirteen episodes' worth of material in the same timeframe as a standard six-episode sketch show, while coping with the many complex makeup and wardrobe changes required, resulted in casting also being partially dependent on the logistics of moving a performer from one character to another. Recurring characters were {{if at all possible}} played by the actor who had originated the part, leading to the development of several signature roles, as for example Baynton's Charles II, Jim Howick's Shouty Man, Rickard's Bob Hale, Willbond's Henry VIII, Martha Howe-Douglas' Elizabeth I and Simon Farnaby's Death.|$|E
5|$|Lionel {{makes his}} first {{appearance}} outside the television series in the Aspect book Smallville: Strange Visitors. In this title, Lionel is concerned <b>that</b> <b>confidence</b> trickster Donald Jacobi will draw {{too much attention to}} the meteor rocks in Smallville and ruin his plans to use the rocks for experiments. Lionel has the life of Jacobi's partner put in jeopardy when he threatens to alert some mobsters who are looking for Lionel. He makes a brief appearance in Smallville: Dragon, in which he tells Lex he used Lex's ex-girlfriend Renata to get close to Lex to test him for unknown reasons. The Smallville version of Lionel makes a brief appearance in the second volume of the internet series Smallville: Chloe Chronicles; he threatens Chloe after she discovers he is involved with the deaths of several people.|$|E

A direct translation of IBUKA is “remember”, which is {{the objective of the}} umbrella association. It is composed of ten member organisations, which work to perpetuate the memory of genocide and provide support to genocide survivors.

25|$|Opponents contend {{the project}} is based on {{uncertain}} projections about maritime trade and the world economy. Roberto N. Méndez, {{an economist at the}} University of Panama, alleges that the economic and financial projections are based on manipulated data. Independent engineers, most notably Humberto Reynolds and Tomás Drohan Ruiz, the former head of engineering and dredging of the Panama Canal, say that the project will cost much more than currently budgeted and that it is too risky for Panama. M. A. Bernal, a professor at the University of Panama, argues <b>that</b> <b>confidence</b> in the ACP's budget is undermined because of the involvement of engineering and consultancy firm Parsons Brinckerhoff.|$|E
25|$|Another option {{circulated}} {{within the}} party saw {{the balance of power}} to be held by either the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and their 25 seats or Social Credit Party of Canada with their 15 seats. St-Laurent was encouraged by others {{to reach out to the}} CCF and at least four of six independent/small party MPs to form a coalition majority government, which would have held 134 of the 265 seats in Parliament—50.1% of the total. St. Laurent, however, had no desire to stay in office; he believed that the nation had passed a verdict against his government and his party. In any case, the CCF and Socreds had pledged to cooperate with a Tory government. It was very likely that St. Laurent would have been defeated on the floor of the House had he tried to stay in power with a minority government, and would not have stayed in office for long even if he survived <b>that</b> <b>confidence</b> vote. With this in mind, St. Laurent resigned on 21 June 1957—ending the longest uninterrupted run in government for a party at the federal level in Canadian history.|$|E

Another Facebook group allegedly inciting Hong Kong residents to slap police officers was shut down by the site's administrators.

There are references to Furtado's favourite {{groups at the}} period [...] such as Salt-n-Pepa, A Tribe Called Quest and Blackstreet, {{many of whom were}} produced by Jerkins himself [...] and her teenage wardrobe. The song's title references the hoop earrings she liked to wear.

2500|$|The Progressive Party, led by Jim Anderton, {{had served}} as a steady {{coalition}} partner to Labour and the electorate probably expected it to remain so. The Green Party, which abstained from opposing the Labour-led government in supply and confidence votes through the life of the 48th Parliament (2005 to 2008), said on 20 October that the only party of the two main parties it could form a coalition with was Labour. In the light of New Zealand First's run-in with the Serious Fraud Office, John Key ruled out that party as a government support partner on 31 August 2008, saying [...] "the sheer weight of allegations and the actions of Mr Peters {{in the last few months}} means that I have lost <b>that</b> <b>confidence</b> in him".|$|E
2500|$|Yet {{there are}} two views on {{assurance}} within Free Grace thinking. The first is <b>that</b> <b>confidence</b> in one's salvation should be the experience of every Christian {{from the moment of}} faith in Christ, but Christian individuals may or may not immediately or ever in this life experience a sense of such confident assurance. The realization of one's possession of eternal life may come at a later time, as a result of further study of the Gospel or of spiritual growth. [...] Views that insist on 100% assurance may actually impede assurance because there is no biblical metric for assurance and, with no metric, one cannot argue that he has achieved it. [...] Assurance is a measure of certainty, and certainty depends on the completeness of the data supporting the proposition to be believed as true, as well as the intellect of the one weighing the evidence. [...] Neither the data nor the intellect rise to a level that can support certainty, so the position that faith equals assurance creates tension for some.|$|E
2500|$|Edmund Craster {{argued that}} the {{original}} Historia, or rather its [...] "original core", was composed in the mid-10th century soon after the visit of King Edmund (c. 945). He {{argued that the}} text is best represented by Ff. 1.27, which ends at chapter 28, thus omitting material dealing directly with the period of Æthelred and Cnut. He theorised that chapters 29 to 32 were added in the 1030s, sometime after 1016, it was claimed, chapters 14–19½ along with chapter 33 were interpolated, a claim devised to explain the reference to the Battle of Assandun (1016) contained in chapter 16. Craster's arguments were criticised {{in the introduction to}} South's 2002 edition, where it was argued that the alleged Assandun interpolation was in fact {{an important part of the}} narrative, an argument earlier made by historian Luisella Simpson. South was inclined to date the narrative as a whole to the mid- or late 11th century, but adds <b>that</b> <b>confidence</b> can only come from further stylistic analysis. David Rollason, specialist in Durham history, has backed a similar date, though he does not suggest, like South, that the text was part of an Anglo-Norman revival in history writing. South also stressed that the Historia was a composite work, and that different passages used by the compiler probably do have earlier dates.|$|E

[...] McKenzie {{respected the}} Society's mantra of [...] "for Indians and by Indians" [...] and understood Indians' distrust of Whites. McKenzie downplayed {{his role as}} [...] "Local Representative" [...] for the Society and worked behind the scenes. He wrote to Parker, [...] "Whatever I may say is subject to two suspicions: First that my race prevents me understanding the situation. Second, that I may have some ulterior motive." [...] "I am always embarrassed by {{doubt in my mind}} as to whether I shall act and speak, or whether I shall contribute most by silence. Everyone who says anything to me tells me to proceed and that the Indians have confidence in me and I am glad and believe that is so, even though doubtful as to what extent <b>that</b> <b>confidence</b> involves action." [...] While Parker was determined that the Society should be run by Indians, it did not diminish his desire for McKenzie's counsel and assistance in managing the organization. In short time, Parker was overwhelmed with the volume of Society work and contemplated resigning. McKenzie exhorted him to stay with the Society, noting [...] "it is not impossible that you are the only man who can save the situation and that you may have to do it by constant correspondence, keeping all in touch one with the other, and keeping all satisfied that equal justice is being arranged for." [...] Parker teamed with McKenzie to manage the Society and navigate politics. Responsibilities included publications, planning conferences, drafting and lobbying legislation and membership services.|$|E
