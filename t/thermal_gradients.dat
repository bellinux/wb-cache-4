5|$|Silicon nitride {{has long}} been used in {{high-temperature}} applications. In particular, it was identified {{as one of the}} few monolithic ceramic materials capable of surviving the severe thermal shock and <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> generated in hydrogen/oxygen rocket engines. To demonstrate this capability in a complex configuration, NASA scientists used advanced rapid prototyping technology to fabricate a one-inch-diameter, single-piece combustion chamber/nozzle (thruster) component. The thruster was hot-fire tested with hydrogen/oxygen propellant and survived five cycles including a 5-minute cycle to a 1320°C material temperature.|$|E

In case of a difference in salinity, the hypolimnion and epilimnion are separated not by a thermocline but by a halocline, which is sometimes referred to as a chemocline.|$|E

First, {{the impact of}} dominant parameters, such as area occupancy of memory/logic, power density, and floorplan on <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> and clock skew are studied. Important results obtained here are 1) the maximum temperature difference increases with higher memory area occupancy and 2) the difference is very floorplan sensitive. Then, we propose a procedure to amend <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient.</b> A slight floorplan modification using the proposed procedure improves on-chip <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> significantly.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} {{to evaluate the}} process parameters by the solid-liquid interface position, <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> angle and the axial <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient.</b> The effects of the process parameters on the solid-liquid interface position, <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> angle and the axial <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> were simulated by ProCAST using LMC(Liquid Metal Cooling) and HRS(High Rate Solidification) processes. The results show that HRS process is little affected by the mold thickness, the dominant heat transfer factor in HRS is radiation from the mold surface, and the dominant heat transfer factor in LMC either mold thermal conductivity or mold-metal interface heat transfer; increasing furnace temperature is beneficial to increase the axial thermal gradient; the withdrawal rate {{is the most important}} process parameter which significantly affects the thermal field during solidification, as the withdrawal rate increases, the axial <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> first increases and then decreases, therefore, it is necessary to apply different withdrawal rates for different alloys. After holding 10 min at different pouring temperatures, a uniform temperature is achieved, and it has slight influence on the subsequent solidification. It has been put forward that the solid-liquid interface position, <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> angle and the axial <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> can be utilized as a serial of efficient analysis standards for optimization of process conditions independent of casting geometry...|$|R

The long history of volcanism in the area, coupled with continued subduction off the British Columbia Coast, indicates that volcanism has not yet concluded in the area. Because of this magmatic heat, Mount Cayley has been a target for geothermal exploration.

Colleagues at UC Berkeley were better able to utilize the black body radiation and more accurately measure the temperature. The hot spot produced by the laser also created large <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> in between the portions of sample that were hit by the focused laser and those that were not.

Large single crystals (about 80nbsp&mm long and 16nbsp&mm in diameter) can be then grown from molten LiH powder in hydrogen atmosphere by the Bridgman–Stockbarger technique. They often have bluish color owing to the presence of colloidal Li. This color can be removed by post-growth annealing at lower temperatures (~550nbsp&°C) and lower <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients.</b> Major impurities in these crystals are Na (20–200 parts per million, ppm), O (10–100 ppm), Mg (0.5–6 ppm), Fe (0.5-2 ppm) and Cu (0.5-2 ppm).|$|E

25|$|This {{equation}} {{shows that}} in order to achieve sufficient current density it is necessary to heat the emitter, taking care not to cause damage by application of excessive heat. For this reason materials with either a high melting point, such as tungsten, or those with a low work function (LaB6) are required for the gun filament. Furthermore, both lanthanum hexaboride and tungsten thermionic sources must be heated in order to achieve thermionic emission, this can be achieved by the use of a small resistive strip. To prevent thermal shock, there is often a delay enforced in the application of current to the tip, to prevent <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> from damaging the filament, the delay is usually a few seconds for LaB6, and significantly lower for tungsten.|$|E

[...] Due to extreme temperature variations induced by the X-ray exposure, carriers are fabricated from materials with high thermal conductivity to reduce <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients.</b> [...] Currently, vitreous carbon and graphite are considered the best material, as their use significantly reduces side-wall roughness. [...] Silicon, silicon nitride, titanium, and diamond are also in use as carrier substrates but not preferred, as the required thin membranes are comparatively fragile and titanium masks tend to round sharp features due to edge fluorescence. [...] Absorbers are gold, nickel, copper, tin, lead, and other X-ray absorbing metals.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{steady state}} creep in a {{rotating}} FGM disc having linearly varying thickness has been analyzed {{in the presence}} of linear <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient.</b> The disc is made of composite containing silicon carbide particles (SiCp) in a matrix of pure aluminium. The content of SiCp in the disc decreases non-linearly from the inner to the outer radius. The distributions of stresses and strain rates, resulting due to disc rotation, have been estimated by imposing various forms of linear <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> in the FGM disc. The results are also estimated from a similar FGM disc but operating at a constant temperature, estimated by averaging the <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> imposed in the disc. The results indicates that the tangential stress increases near the inner radius but decreases towards the outer radius and the radial stress increases throughout when the FGM disc is assumed to operate under a linear <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient.</b> However, the strain rates in the FGM disc decreases significantly {{in the presence of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> as compared to those observed in the FGM disc operating at a constant average temperature...|$|R
40|$|Mice housed at 30 [deg]C and inoculated with a mouse-adapted {{influenza}} virus show a fall in body temperature (Tb) and {{a decrease in}} food intake to almost 0 grams per day. This study tested whether the fall in Tb could be accounted for by the decreased food intake and whether the fall in Tb was due to a decrease of thermoregulatory set point or to an inability to maintain Tb at set point level. The fall in Tb of influenza-infected mice was greater than that of food-deprived mice. When food deprived, mice given access to a <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> increased their preference for warmer areas in the gradient and, as a result, Tb did not fall as much as Tb of starved mice not given access to a <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient.</b> When infected with {{influenza virus}}, mice given a <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> decreased Tb less and at a slower rate than mice not given a gradient. However, this fall in Tb of influenza-infected mice was greater than that of food-deprived mice given a <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient.</b> Mice given a <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> increased their preference for the warmer temperatures after inoculation; this returned to preinoculation preference for cooler temperatures during the later days of infection despite a continuous fall in Tb. Influenza-infected mice given a <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> survived significantly fewer days than infected mice not given a <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient.</b> We conclude that the influenza-induced fall of Tb in mice cannot be explained solely by the decrease in food intake, and is partially due to a decrease in thermoregulatory set point...|$|R
2500|$|Although no mass extinctions {{of marine}} diatoms have been {{observed}} during the Cenozoic, times of relatively rapid evolutionary turnover in marine diatom assemblages occurred near the Paleocene–Eocene boundary and at the Eocene–Oligocene boundary. [...] Further turnover of assemblages took place at various times between the middle Miocene and late Pliocene, in response to progressive cooling of polar regions {{and the development of}} more endemic diatom assemblages. [...] A global trend toward more delicate diatom frustules has been noted from the Oligocene to the Quaternary. [...] This coincides with an increasingly more vigorous circulation of the ocean’s surface and deep waters brought about by increasing latitudinal <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> at the onset of major ice sheet expansion on Antarctica and progressive cooling through the Neogene and Quaternary towards a bipolar glaciated world. This drove the diatoms into uptaking silica more competitively (i.e., to use less silica in formation of their frustules). Increased mixing of the oceans renews silica and other nutrients necessary for diatom growth in surface waters, especially in regions of coastal and oceanic upwelling.|$|E
2500|$|Likewise, the {{configurations}} of laboratory apparatus involving condensers are many and varied, to cover {{low and high}} boiling solvents, simple and complex separations, etc. Several common process types based on the change of physical state provided by condensers can easily be described, including simple evaporations or [...] "solvent stripping" [...] (the bulk removal of all volatiles to leave behind concentrated solutes present in the original solution being evaporated), reflux operations (where {{the aim is to}} contain all volatiles while providing a constant process temperature established by the boiling point of the solvent system being used), and separation/distillation operations (where high theoretical plates provide for selective delivery of one or more volatile components of a complex [...] "mixture" [...] in a controlled fashion). The direction of vapor and condensate flows in the laboratory condenser chosen for each of these may vary (e.g., being countercurrent in reflux procedures, and concurrent in many simple distillation procedures), as do the optimal flow direction for the cooling fluid, etc. In all processes, condenser selection/design requires that the heat of entering vapor never overwhelm the condenser and cooling mechanism; as well, the <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> and material flows established during the gas-liquid transition are critical aspects, so that as processes increase in scale from laboratory to pilot plant and beyond, the design of condenser systems becomes a precise engineering science.|$|E
2500|$|... where [...] is {{the number}} of {{theoretical}} plates, [...] is the apparent mobility in the separation medium and [...] is the diffusion coefficient of the analyte. [...] According to this equation, the efficiency of separation is only limited by diffusion and is proportional to the strength of the electric field, although practical considerations limit the strength of the electric field to several hundred volts per centimeter. [...] Application of very high potentials (>20-30 kV) may lead to arcing or breakdown of the capillary. [...] Further, application of strong electric fields leads to resistive heating (Joule heating) of the buffer in the capillary. [...] At sufficiently high field strengths, this heating is strong enough that radial temperature gradients can develop within the capillary. [...] Since electrophoretic mobility of ions is generally temperature-dependent (due to both temperature-dependent ionization and solvent viscosity effects), a non-uniform temperature profile results in variation of electrophoretic mobility across the capillary, and a loss of resolution. [...] The onset of significant Joule heating can be determined by constructing an [...] "Ohm's Law plot", wherein the current through the capillary is measured as a function of applied potential. [...] At low fields, the current is proportional to the applied potential (Ohm's Law), whereas at higher fields the current deviates from the straight line as heating results in decreased resistance of the buffer. [...] The best resolution is typically obtained at the maximum field strength for which Joule heating is insignificant (i.e. near the boundary between the linear and nonlinear regimes of the Ohm's Law plot). [...] Generally capillaries of smaller inner diameter support use of higher field strengths, due to improved heat dissipation and smaller <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> relative to larger capillaries, but with the drawbacks of lower sensitivity in absorbance detection due to shorter path length, and greater difficulty in introducing buffer and sample into the capillary (small capillaries require greater pressure and/or longer times to force fluids through the capillary).|$|E
