This test requires subjects to walk at a brisk pace. However the ability to predict V 02 max is unknown when walking at paces slower than a brisk walk. Methods: Healthy adults (N = 35) performed a GXT following a modified Balke protocol to obtain V 02 max and VT. All subjects also completed two 1 -mile walk tests. The first walk test followed the Rockport Fitness Walking Test protocol, completing the test at a brisk pace. Other than walking at a comfortable pace, the second walk test also followed the Rockport Fitness Walking Test protocol. V 02 max from the GXT was compared to the prediction ofV 02 max from the brisk and comfortable walk tests. Results: Total walk <b>time,</b> <b>lap</b> time, and HR were all higher for the brisk pace in comparison to the comfortably paced walk, while RPE was lowest for the comfortable pace walk. The brisk walk was better able to predict V 02 max and VT. Conclusion: The Rockport Fitness Walking Test must be performed at a brisk pace or higher to accurately predict V 02 max...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCharacterization of {{synaptic}} transmission {{between the}} inner ear sensory cells and primary neuron dendrites has been hampered by the limited access to the postsynaptic terminals. Because direct physiological recording of postsynaptic currents are difficult to achieve, no information regarding the synaptic and dendritic events are available. This {{is due to the}} small size of the postsynaptic afferent nerve endings that do not allow a clear identification, and thus compromise direct electrophysiological recordings of the buttons. To study the physiology of afferent nerve endings, we have developed a two-photon imaging technique in cochlear and vestibular slice preparations from neonatal rats and turtles. This technique is based on a retrograde labeling of afferent nerve endings with high-affinity calcium-sensitive dyes. Dye filling was achieved by 6 h application of the dextran-amine conjugate of calcium green- 1. Calcium changes were measured in afferent nerve endings in line scan and <b>time</b> <b>lap</b> mode. To address recording in a near-physiological situation, iontophoretic application of K+ was performed {{in the area of the}} stereocilia whereas glutamate was applied at the basal pole of sensory hair cells. Both types of application cause a reversible and sustained increase of Ca 2 + in the button of afferent nerve fibers. Typical recordings are presented and potential interests for pharmacological studies of inner ear sensory cell synapses are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Sweden is {{entering}} the ageing society. On a national level, {{and in a}} cyclic process with a <b>time</b> <b>lap</b> of 30 to 40 years, three architecture competitions have been realized during the 20 th century in order to renew spatial thinking concerning housing for dependent and frail persons in need of daily care and caring, in the following termed Residential Care Homes, RCH. During {{the first years of}} the 21 st century, the number of available flats in a RCH dropped with 23 per cent. As a result, the matter of appropriate housing for frail older people entered the political agenda. In 2010, the Swedish government launched the governmental program Growing Old, Living well, GOLW, in order to explore residential housing for the emerging ageing society. In the program, architecture competitions were recognized as a method for innovating architecture and the built environment. This study is a parallel case study on three municipal organizers 9 ̆ 2 considerations and preparations for organizing invited architecture competitions with prequalification. The research material consists of written documentation, questionnaires and interviews. All in all, 42 respondents participated, all actors in the municipal process of realizing either a pilot study in view of a subsequent architectural competition, or just the latter option. The assembled research material was submitted to a close reading analysis, which allowed for reconstructing the municipal organizational processes as to their dynamics. The study sheds light on how municipal actors work with the matter of organizing a competition, and gives an estimate of time necessary for planning one. The study lends support to assuming that the ideal time frame for organizing and realizing municipal competitions is approximately 21 months.

40|$|The best racedriver {{is the one}} that, with a given vehicle, is able {{to drive}} on a given track in the {{shortest}} possible time. Thus, the only target is the lap time. A racedrivermodel has to do the same. The first step towards this target is to decide which trajectory to follow. In fact, the optimal trajectory is the best compromise between the shortest track and the track that allows to achieve the highest speeds (least curvature track). Thus, the problem of trajectory planning is a bounded optimisation problem that has {{to take into account}} not only the geometry of the circuit but also the dynamics of the vehicle. A simplified vehicle dynamic model is used for this purpose. Due {{to the fact that the}} vehicle will be driven at its limit performances, although simplified, the model has to correctly reproduce the maximum possible acceleration, a function of the vehicle speed, the maximum possible deceleration, again a function of the vehicle speed, and the maximum lateral acceleration, a function of both the vehicle speed and the steering angle. Knowing the trajectory, the vehicle model allows to determine the lap time. Through an optimisation algorithm it is therefore possible to determine the best compromise between shortest track and track with the minimum curvature, i. e. the trajectory (in terms of track and speed profile) that allows to minimize the <b>time</b> <b>lap.</b> Once the best trajectory has been determined (both in terms of best track and best speed profile), it is necessary to identify the driver’s inputs to follow the given trajectory. This task is carried out by considering the driver as a controller that acts on a nonlinear plant (the vehicle) in order to achieve the desired results. Thus, the driver converts the best trajectory into vehicle’s inputs. The mutual interaction between plant and controller (the driver’s inputs are not only a function of the best trajectory but also of the driver’s reactions due to the vehicle’s dynamics) is not taken into account in this paper...|$|E

40|$|Adhesives are an {{important}} yet often overlooked aspect of human tool use. Previous experiments have shown that compound resin/gum adhesive production by anatomically modern humans was a cognitively demanding task that required advanced use of fire, forward planning, and abstraction among other traits. Yet the oldest known adhesives were produced by Neandertals, not anatomically modern humans. These tar or pitch adhesives are an entirely different material, produced from a distinct, albeit similarly complex process. However, the material properties of these adhesives {{and the influence of}} the production process on performance is still unclear. To this end we conducted a series of laboratory based lap shear and impact tests following modern adhesive testing standards and at three different temperatures to measure the strength of pine and birch pitch adhesives. We tested eight different recipes that contain charcoal as an additive (mimicking contamination) or were reduced by boiling for different lengths of <b>time.</b> <b>Lap</b> shear tests were conducted on wood and flint adherends to determine shear strength on different materials, and we conducted high load-rate tests to understand how the same material behaves under impact forces. Our results indicate that both pine and birch pitch adhesives behave similarly at room temperature. Pine pitch is highly sensitive to the addition of charcoal and further heating. Up to a certain extent charcoal additives increases performance, as does extra seething. However, too much charcoal and seething will reduce performance. Similarly, pine pitch is sensitive to ambient temperature changes and it is strongest at 0 °C and weakest at 38 °C. Adhesive failures occur in a similar manner on flint and wood suggesting the weakest part of a flint-adhesive-wood composite tool may have been the cohesive strength of the adhesive. Finally, pine pitch adhesives may be better suited to resisting high-load rate impacts than shear forces. Our experiments show that pitch production and post-production manipulation are sensitive processes, and to obtain a workable and strong adhesive one requires a deep understanding of the material properties. Our results validate previous archaeological adhesive studies that suggest that the manufacture and use of adhesives was an advanced technological process. Adhesion Institut...|$|E
40|$|Although {{positive}} and expiratory pressure (PEEP) {{is known to}} depress the cardiac output, the mechanism remains debated. Two series of experiments were designed to explore this mechanism. In the first study, the application of 15 cm H 2 O of PEEP to nine anesthetized, ventilated dogs led to a reduction of cardiac index from (mean ± one standard error of the mean) 2. 71 L/min ·m 2 ± 0. 35 to 2. 19 L/min m 2 ± 0. 22 (p <. 05) and a drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 117 mm Hg ± 8 to 91 mm Hg ± 11 (p <. 01). The mean net (vascular minus pleural pressure) pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) rose from 15. 3 mm Hg ± 1. 2 to 20. 6 mm Hg ± 1. 8 (p <. 02). The mean net central venous pressure (CVP) rose from 5. 2 mm Hg ± 0. 9 to 8. 4 mm Hg ± 0. 9 (p <. 05) and the net pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP) rose from 6. 7 mm Hg ± 0. 7 to 9. 5 mm Hg ± 0. 9 (p <. 01). There was a nonsignificant rise in the mean net left atrial pressure (LAP). As PEEP was raised in increments from 0 to 20 cm H 2 O, both LAP and PAWP increased. The rise in PAWP was always greater than the increase in LAP. The difference between PAWP and LAP was strongly correlated {{with the increase in}} MPAP (r = 0. 98). This relationship was useful in correcting the PAWP during PEEP. The problem of cardiac depression was evaluated in a second series of eight dogs. These animals underwent complete chest wall excision to eliminate any possible direct effects of increased pleural pressure on the heart and great vessels. The absence of the chest wall permitted hyperexpansion of the lungs, particularly with positive end expiratory pressure. At 15 cm H 2 O of PEEP, the mean cardiac index fell in these animals from 2. 36 L/min· m 2 ± 0. 26 to 1. 47 L/min·m 2 ± 0. 18 (p <. 01) and the MAP fell from 105 mm Hg ± 16. 2 to 68 mm Hg ± 4. 8 (p <. 001). The CVP rose from a mean of 5. 5 mm Hg ± 0. 4 to 8. 3 mm Hg ± 0. 6 (p <. 01) and the LAP rose from 6. 3 mm Hg ± 0. 8 to 8. 0 mm Hg ± 1. 1 (p <. 05). The MPAP rose from 18. 0 mm Hg ± 0. 6 to 23. 3 mm Hg ± 1. 6 (p <. 01). Comparison of Group I and II showed a significantly greater depression of the cardiac output and MAP in the open-chested animals. At the same <b>time</b> <b>LAP</b> was significantly higher. These data strongly suggest that PEEP and particularly pulmonary hyperinflation induce biventricular failure...|$|E
