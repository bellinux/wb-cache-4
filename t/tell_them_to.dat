When people ask me which E.T. they should look at, I always <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> look at the original 1982 E.T. If you notice, when we did put out E.T. we put out two E.T.s. We put out the digitally enhanced version with the additional scenes and for no extra money, in the same package, we put out the original '82 version. I always tell people {{to go back to the}} '82 version.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{deuterium}} being {{a valuable}} commodity, Archer is {{startled by the}} lack of basic medical supplies and the run-down nature of the colony. The reason becomes apparent when seven Klingons show up to collect deuterium according to their 'regular arrangement'. When Tessic informs Korok (Robertson Dean), the leader of the Klingons, {{that they do not have}} all the deuterium because two pumps were not working, Korok hits him and gives them four days to meet the order. Later, when Tucker and Archer attempt to talk them into fighting against the Klingons, Tessic <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> take their 200 liters and leave. However, leaving does not sit well with Archer and he convinces the leader to resist with their support.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{a backup}} relief party of 77 teams and wagons was {{making its way}} east to provide {{additional}} assistance to the Martin Company. After passing Fort Bridger {{the leaders of the}} backup party concluded that the Martin Company must have wintered east of the Rockies, so they turned back. When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had been lost. On November 18 the backup party met the Martin Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last {{all the members of the}} handcart party were now able to ride in wagons. The 104 wagons carrying the Martin Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company had lost their lives. Many of the survivors had to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated due to severe frostbite.|$|E

25|$|In the afternoon, Thailand's coup leader ordered media {{executives}} to army headquarters to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> stop carrying expression {{of public opinion}} following the military takeover. The move came after the military imposed strict controls on the media and said they would block information deemed harmful to the provisional military council now in control of Thailand. The army official said the normal television programming will be resumed but the council would begin making its own televised announcements every two hours starting from 11:00 am (04:00 GMT).|$|E
25|$|Ireland's fifth {{victim was}} Maltese chef Emanuel Spiteri, aged 41, {{whom he had}} met at the Coleherne pub. Spiteri was persuaded to be cuffed and bound on his bed. Once more, Ireland demanded his PIN number but did not obtain it. He again used a noose to kill. After {{carrying}} out his post-murder ritual of cleaning and clearing the scene, Ireland {{set fire to the}} flat and left. He rang the police later to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> look for a body at the scene of a fire and added that he would probably not kill again.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{other groups}} which formed yeshivas in pre-war Poland, Belz {{maintained}} a unique yoshvim program, developed by Rabbi Yissachar Dov, which produced many outstanding Torah scholars. The yoshvim were married and unmarried men {{who remained in}} the synagogue all day to study the Talmud, pray, and derive inspiration from their Rebbe. They were supported by local businessmen, and their food and other necessities were brought to them so they wouldn't {{have to leave the}} synagogue for even a short time. Some yoshvim even slept in the synagogue on benches. They typically remained in this program until the Rebbe would <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> return home to their wives and families.|$|E
25|$|If {{you wish}} you may tell the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. Of course, I am a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E
25|$|Catastrophe is {{not only}} about a {{political}} situation and {{the place of the}} artist in it. The victim or “protagonist” is also representative of all actors, having to portray what writers write for them in the way directors <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> do it (Beckett is not unaware of his own relationship with actors, particularly those who in the past have resisted his stage directions). The director in the play catches two prototypes, that of the political commissar and of the all-powerful personality director like Peter Brook, Vitez, , who bend a performance to their own interpretation, where often the victim is the author himself; there are many “in” theatrical jokes. The director’s assistant coolly carries out her instructions, and it matters little if we are in a concentration camp or a film studio: all humane considerations are ruled out to achieve the ultimate work of art. The two-pronged metaphor is incredibly effective for all its surface simplicity. In time, as with all of Beckett’s work, more strands and allusions will be discovered.|$|E

500|$|In the evening, tens of {{thousands}} of government supporters, borrowing the anti-government protesters' slogan [...] "no Sunni, no Shia, only Bahraini", gathered in Al Fateh Mosque in Juffair.

500|$|Kraemer, Cassidy, and Schwartz {{argued that}} [...] "Barge of the Dead" [...] {{mirrored}} the [...] episode [...] "Rightful Heir" [...] by not providing a clear answer whether Torres' {{experiences in the}} Klingon afterlife were real or part of a hallucination. The Native American studies scholar Sierra S. Adare was critical of the portrayal of Chakotay—a Native American character—as dismissive of Torres' sincere belief in her experiences, writing that [...] "o Native person would ever dismiss another's visions as hallucinations or <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> ignore their religious beliefs". She cited it as one instance in which the series represented Chakotay as [...] "the quintessential Tonto in outer space".|$|E

500|$|In 1904, {{numerous}} {{newspaper articles}} and editorials were written, mostly in Chicago, about the society. Those articles were often sensationalist {{and tended to}} put the society in a bad light. The views of the society, particularly those against marriage and promoting free love, were not accepted well in the small Ohio village of Lisbon. In fact, a local newspaper reprinted a warning that had been distributed in the community: [...] "Wanted – Fifty good women, over twenty and under fifty years of age; also fifty good honest-hearted men with families, to meet upon the Square when called upon, {{and go to the}} Spirit Fruit farm and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> take their departure at once or take the consequences, as tar is cheap and feathers plentiful." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Harlem's Apollo Theater, where Sims {{had served}} {{for years as}} Amateur Night's [...] "executioner", had been closed for most of a decade. Then, {{following}} an extensive renovation, the venue reopened in 1985, bringing increased attention to both the Apollo and his role there. [...] "I'm their protector, not the executioner," [...] he explained to The Washington Post. [...] "Because that audience can get really hostile." [...] Sims described seeing displeased audiences throw bottles and even horseshoes at performers who he did not hustle off stage fast enough. When The New York Times interviewed him about his [...] "executioner" [...] role, {{he said of the}} acts that got booed off, [...] "I <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> work on their act and come back," [...] encouraging them to try again.|$|E
500|$|While Eddy {{argued that}} reality was entirely spiritual (and {{therefore}} entirely good), it remained true {{that human beings}} were affected by their belief in evil, which meant it had power, even if the power was an illusion. Evil was [...] "like a bankrupt to whom credit is still granted," [...] writes Wilson. To defend herself against it, Eddy organized [...] "watches," [...] during which students (known as mental or metaphysical workers) would give [...] "adverse treatment" [...] to her enemies. This was called [...] "taking up the enemy in thought." [...] According to former students, Eddy would <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> say (often with Richard Kennedy in mind): [...] "You are affected as you wish to affect me.

500|$|Late on {{the night}} of August 15, Stark was awakened by the arrival of Parson Thomas Allen and a band of Massachusetts militiamen from nearby Berkshire County who insisted on joining his force. In {{response}} to the minister's fiery threat that his men would never come out again if they were not allowed to participate, Stark is reported to have said, [...] "Would you go now on this dark and rainy night? Go back to your people and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> get some rest if they can, and if the Lord gives us sunshine to-morrow and I do not give you fighting enough, I will never call on you to come again."

500|$|In an {{interview}} on his career, Baxter was asked if joining the senior ranks {{was the beginning of}} his football education.

Describing McNaught as, ‘a smashing guy’, Baxter explained how instead of thoughtlessly charging forward with the ball, McNaught suggested more considered football – change from running 30 yards to produce a five-yard pass to running five yards and producing a 30-yard pass. This, Baxter then stated, was his football education with Willie McNaught the provider. He later said of his time with the two Fife clubs, [...] "I would never have made it in today's circumstances.
