5|$|Not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>outdone</b> by the Vietnamese {{military}} build-up, the Government of Democratic Kampuchea {{was busy}} strengthening its armed forces with Chinese support. In previous years, China had only provided the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army {{with a limited}} amount of arms and ammunition, but as relations with Vietnam worsened in 1978, Beijing established additional supply routes through Kampuchea and increased the volume of military hardware which travelled down each route. On the eve of the Vietnamese invasion, Kampuchea had an estimated 73,000 soldiers in the Eastern Military Zone bordering Vietnam. At that time, all branches of the Kampuchean armed forces were significantly strengthened by large quantities of Chinese-made military equipment, which included fighter aircraft, patrol boats, heavy artillery, anti-aircraft guns, trucks and tanks. Additionally, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Chinese advisers in both military and civilian capacities, providing their support to the Khmer Rouge regime.|$|E

Facing towards West Berlin was the proclamation DER KLUGE BERLINER KAUFT BEI DER H.O. (The Wise Berliner Buys With The H.O.)

Giants coach Ryan Gregorio used up all of his timeouts but the Realtors managed to convert their inside jumpers. Espino scored 10 points {{in the fourth quarter}} to prevent a Purefoods incursion to assure the Sta. Lucia franchise their first Philippine Cup championship and their second championship overall. Espino was adjudged as the Finals MVP.|$|E
25|$|Arguably, the league's best {{offensive}} game is {{property of}} Jesse Abel of the Explorers. On June 7, 2013, Abel went 3-for-5 with two home runs, a double, and a record six RBIs.

Not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>outdone,</b> Lucas Doerhoff of the Pioneers matched Abel's multi-home-run feat on July 21, 2013. Doerhoff, too, went 3-for-5 on his banner day, but added a triple to go with his pair of home runs. His 11 total bases set an LCBL record for a single game; albeit in a 12-11 loss to the Explorers.|$|E

25|$|The Abbasids {{wasted no}} time in {{continuing}} from Khorosan into Mesopotamia. In August 749, Umayyad commander Yazid ibn Umar al-Fazari attempted to meet the forces of al-Ta'i before they could reach Kufa. Not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>outdone,</b> the Abbasids launched a nighttime raid on al-Fazari's forces before they had a chance to prepare. During the raid, al-Ta'i himself was finally killed in battle. Despite the loss, al-Fazari was routed and fled with his forces to Wasit. The Siege of Wasit took place from that August until July 750. Although a respected military commander had been lost, {{a large portion of the}} Umayyad forces were essentially trapped inside Wasit and could be left in their virtual prison while more offensive military actions were made.|$|E

Harriman placed an order to cover this, but was overridden by his broker, Jacob Schiff, of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. Hill, on the other hand, reached the vacationing Morgan in Italy and managed to place an order for 150,000shares of common stock. Though Harriman might be able to control the preferred stock, Hill knew the company bylaws allowed for the holders of the common stock to vote to retire the preferred.|$|E

The Germans, not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>outdone,</b> marched with 6,000 crusaders on Xerigordos and captured the city to use as a base to raid the countryside. In response, the Turks, led by one of Kilij Arslan's generals, recovered Xerigordos from the crusaders, who were forced to drink the blood of donkeys and their own urine during the siege, since their water supply was cut. Some of the crusaders who were captured converted to Islam and were sent to Khorasan, while others who refused to abandon their faith were killed.|$|E

25|$|In April, the Soviet Union's {{political}} support for North Vietnam materialised with the delivery of MiG fighter planes and SAM-2 anti-aircraft missiles, along with large quantities of food and ammunition. In addition, Soviet pilots and other specialists were dispatched to North Vietnam to train North Vietnamese military personnel {{in the use of}} advanced military hardware. China, not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>outdone</b> by its Soviet rival, increased the delivery of armaments to North Vietnam at rates which surpassed their commitments in 1964. China also offered logistical assistance to the North Vietnamese military by providing seven divisions of Chinese soldiers for road construction and other projects. The logistical support offered by China {{had a significant impact on}} the North Vietnamese military, as North Vietnam needed all its combat divisions to conduct operations, to aide the Pathet Lao in Laos and the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>outdone</b> by his wife, Lieutenant-Governor Franklin {{opened the}} Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery {{a year later}} in October 1843. In 1844 he also founded the Royal Society of Tasmania, the first such Royal Society outside of the United Kingdom. The enlightened {{governorship}} of the Franklins brought much social and cultural improvement to Hobart Town, and culminated in the town's incorporation as a city in 1842. The town had grown from a defensive outpost into a penal settlement, and from there, into a prosperous trading port. Free settlers were outstripping the arrival of convicts, and soon the colonists were clamouring {{for an end to}} transportation, and greater self-representation. The Tasmanian Journal of Natural Science was first published in 1840; however economic depression hit all of the Australian colonies that year, and Hobart Town suffered badly in what was to be the beginning of the first of many economic downturns.|$|E
25|$|The 1960s saw {{important}} {{developments in}} both Welsh and English language music in Wales. The BBC had already produced Welsh language Radio programmes, such as Noson Lowen in the 1940s, {{and in the}} 1960s the corporation followed suite with television shows Hob y Deri Dando and Disc a Dawn giving Welsh acts a weekly stage to promote their sound. A more homely programme Gwlad y Gan was produced by rival channel TWW which set classic Welsh songs in idyllic settings and starred baritone Ivor Emmanuel. The Anglo-American cultural influence was a strong draw on young musicians, with Tom Jones and Shirley Bassey becoming world-famous singers; {{and the growth of}} The Beatles' Apple Records label saw Welsh acts Mary Hopkin and Badfinger join the roster. Not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>outdone,</b> the short lived Y Blew, born out of Aberystwyth University, became the first Welsh language pop band in 1967. This was followed in 1969 with the establishment of the Sain record label, {{one of the most important}} catalyst for change in the Welsh language music scene.|$|E

25|$|In {{the night}} of 22 June, Reijersen sent ashore a {{scouting}} party of three men and a Chinese guide {{to see if the}} 10,000 Chinese residents of the city would remain neutral. They soon returned after finding the Chinese had fled the city ahead of the invasion. In the following morning Reijersen himself boarded a launch with some senior officers to scout for a suitable landing site, and it was decided that the invading army would make their landing on the eastern Cacilhas Beach the next day. To distract the defenders from the intended landing site, three ships – Groeningen, Gallias, and Engelsche Beer – started to bombard the São Franciso battery in the south on 23 June. After an afternoon of cannon volleys and insults (where Dutch seamen threatened to rape Macau's women after killing all men above twenty), the ships withdrew for the night without inflicting any casualties on the Portuguese side. Nonetheless, the Dutch celebrated their expected victory in advance by blowing their trumpets and beating their drums all night. Not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>outdone,</b> the Portuguese retaliated with similar martial festivities in the city's bulwarks.|$|E
25|$|The end of {{the first}} half briefly {{interrupted}} the barrage of scoring, but it quickly resumed in the second. On the second play of the half, Holmes' 48-yard run moved the ball to the Colts 22-yard line. But on the next play, Indianapolis defensive back David Macklin stripped the ball from Holmes and recovered it. After that, the Colts drove to the Chiefs 22-yard line before Kansas City's first key defensive play of the game, defensive tackle Shawn Barber tackling James for a 5-yard loss on third down, forced them to settle for a Mike Vanderjagt field goal, increasing their lead to 24–10. But the Chiefs were not about to go down. Hall returned the ensuing kickoff 26 yards to his own 44-yard line. Then Holmes made up for his earlier mistake by carrying the ball on six of the eight plays of Kansas City's possession, gaining 44 yards and finishing the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. Not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>outdone,</b> Manning responded with five consecutive completions for 57 yards, including a 19-yard touchdown pass to Wayne to put the Colts back up by 14 points. But this margin turned out to be short lived; Hall returned the ensuing kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|The Dolphins had to punt {{early in}} the second quarter {{at the end of their}} next drive, once again forcing their defense to deal with the terror of Kelly, Thomas, and Reed. This time the three players would combine for 67 yards as Thomas rushed twice for eight and caught an 11-yard pass before Kelly's 43-yard {{completion}} to Reed brought up first and goal on the Miami 5-yard line. Thomas ran it across the goal line from there, giving the Bills a 20-3 lead. But on this occasion the Dolphins were ready to respond as Marino completed an 11-yard pass to Mark Duper on third and 5, and then hooked up with him again for a 64-yard touchdown completion that cut the score to 20-10. Not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>outdone,</b> Kelly led the Bills back on a 68-yard scoring drive, starting with a 19-yard pass to Lofton on the first play and a 9-yard run on the next. Later in the drive, he kept it going with a 13-yard pass to Reed on fourth and 3 from the Dolphins 32, and eventually finished it off with a 7-yard touchdown toss to Lofton. With Norwood's extra point, the Bills were up by 17 at 27-10 with five minutes left in the half.|$|E
