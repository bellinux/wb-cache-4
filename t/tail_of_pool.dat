30|$|DEFTL (Jia et al. 2017) {{incorporated}} PDE into FTL. DEFTL {{also has}} two modes, a public and a hidden mode. The deniability of DEFTL {{is achieved by}} using the data (and their behavior) in the public mode to deny the data (and their behavior) in the hidden mode. Most importantly, to prevent the data written in the public mode from over-writing the data written in the hidden mode, DEFTL carefully modifies the block allocation and garbage collection strategies in the FTL such that the two modes can be “stealthily” isolated without being known by the adversary. Specifically, the public volume will allocate flash blocks from the head <b>of</b> the block <b>pool</b> and the hidden volume will allocate flash blocks from the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pool.</b> In addition, garbage collection in the two modes will be modified as: In the public mode, garbage collection will be performed actively to fill {{the head of the}} pool; in the hidden mode, garbage collection will be performed actively to fill the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pool.</b> This can avoid that the public mode has used all the blocks in the head and starts to use the blocks in the tail, over-writing the hidden sensitive data. DEFTL also provides a few attacks on the existing PDE systems for mobile devices.|$|R
60|$|Once {{more the}} lips were projected, {{once again the}} cup was raised, but that salmon seemed {{to know what was}} going on, for, just as the cup and the lips met, it went off in an unusually fierce run down the river. The cup and its {{contents}} were knocked into George's face, and George himself was knocked over by his father as he sprang down the bank, and ran along a dry patch of gravel, which extended to the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pool.</b>|$|R
60|$|Grace's tweed {{dress was}} wet and rather muddy {{when she stood}} with Gerald on a gravel bank at the head <b>of</b> a <b>pool,</b> where the beck from the tarn joined a larger stream that flowed through a {{neighboring}} dale. There had been some rain and the water was stained a warm claret-color by the peat. Bright sunshine pierced the tossing alder branches, and the rapid close by sparkled between belts of moving shade. Large white dogs with black and yellow spots swam uncertainly about the pool and searched the bank; {{a group of men}} stood in the rapid, while another group watched the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pool.</b> Somewhere between them a hard-pressed otter hid.|$|R
60|$|In {{itself the}} work was arduous enough, since four men alone could toil at the winch, {{and some of the}} masses they raised were ponderous. Indeed, there was {{scarcely}} room for four persons on the shelf hewn out above the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pool,</b> and the narrow strip of stone was slippery with ice. Fine spray that froze on all it touched whirled about the workers, {{and every now and then}} a heavy fragment that slipped from the claws fell with a great splash. Nasmyth's wrists grew raw from the rasp of the hide jacket, and wide cracks opened in his fingers.|$|R
60|$|Ingleby {{was close}} beside him, {{and for a}} moment the two men looked into each other's eyes. In less than another minute the object they had seen would swing out with the outflow at the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pool,</b> and the long white rapid would whirl it beyond their reach into the gloom again. Night was close at hand, and, if they let him pass, Trooper Probyn would by morning have {{travelled}} far into the heart of a wilderness where it was scarcely likely that any of them would ever overtake him. The rivers of the North run fast, and that is a country wherein the strongest man must travel slowly. It seemed to Ingleby that it might be better to let him go. Then he was ashamed of the doubt that this implied, and Sewell, who knew what he was thinking, glanced for just a second in Tomlinson's direction.|$|R
60|$|Chatterton, though driving {{sideways}} {{down the}} stream, could apparently swim a little, {{and did not}} appear unduly alarmed. Indeed, Dane had cause for believing he feared nothing except ridicule; {{but he was very}} heavy, and panted stentoriously, while muddy froth beat into the younger man's eyes and nostrils, and the rebound, which surged in a whirling eddy from a central rock, swept them down together toward the white race between the boulders at the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pool.</b> Dane had no intention of being hammered against them if it could be avoided, and did his utmost, thrusting with one hand on Chatterton's shoulder and swimming on his side. Still, the boulders swept up-stream past them, the larches flitted by, and though they drew clear of the fastest rush, it seemed impossible that they could make a landing in time to escape the rapid. Chatterton was apparently swallowing water, and choking badly now.|$|R
60|$|They {{headed for}} the boulder beach, where they landed the half-breed. He made a line fast to the craft and went up-stream {{with the end of}} it, while Carnally thrust the canoe out and, with Andrew's help, forced her up against the current, aided by the line. It was arduous work. The foam stood high about the bows; eddies {{swirling}} up from the rough bottom swung them to and fro and, although they strained every muscle, now and then brought them to a standstill. Angry waves broke on board freely, and Andrew realized that if Lucien lost his footing or slackened his efforts the line would be torn from him and they would be swept back to the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pool.</b> This, however, would be better than being sucked into the cataract close outshore, which would no doubt result in the canoe's capsizing. At last they reached a spot where they must stem the main rush, which swung in nearer the bank.|$|R
3000|$|IDIFs {{had lower}} {{correspondence}} with AIFs for rubidium than water, particularly {{in terms of}} peak activity. Unlike water, rubidium is retained in myocardial tissue, causing the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> the blood <b>pool</b> TAC to fall below that of the myocardium TAC (water IDIFs will have matched activity in the <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> the LV cavity and myocardium TACs). When 82 Rb images are degraded by motion and resolution effects, expected consequences for IDIFs are reduced peak activity (spill-out from LV cavity) and increased tail activity (spill-in from myocardium). Though prior publications’ images [11, 12] were likely of poorer resolution than this study’s, their IDIFs were uncorrected. In the current study, we primarily observed reduced peak activity in 82 Rb IDIFs, with differences in tail activity inconsistent with a strict model of geometric PVC (Eq.  3). In Katoh et al. [13], LV TACs were corrected using a PVC model; that model overcorrected the <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> our 82 Rb IDIFs. A mismatch between 82 Rb IDIFs and AIFs was better described using a two-parameter model (Eq.  4), which provides for signal mixing with background regions. The simpler scale factor correction (Eq.  5), which recovers activity from an unspecified combination of resolution degradation effects, gave comparable results. For half the 82 Rb acquisitions, the AUC-based scale factor β [...]...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{chum salmon}} spawn in small streams and {{intertidal}} zones. Some chum travel more than 3,200 km up the Yukon River. Chum [...] fry migrate {{out to sea}} from March through July, almost immediately after becoming free swimmers. They spend one to three years traveling very long distances in the ocean. These are the last salmon to spawn (November to January) in some regions. In Alaska {{they are the first}} to spawn in June and August and are then followed by pink and coho salmon. They die about two weeks after they return to the freshwater to spawn. They utilize the lower tributaries of the watershed, tend to build nests called redds, really little more than protected depressions in the gravel, in shallow edges of the watercourse and at the <b>tail</b> end <b>of</b> deep <b>pools.</b> The female lays eggs in the redd, the male sprays milt on the eggs, and the female covers the eggs with gravel.
