Hajati has agreed to let Samioen take a second wife as she wants Dasima's money, which she will use for gambling. When Dasima realises that she has been tricked, she begins to {{keep a close eye on}} her remaining wealth. So that he can <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> her remaining funds, Samioen calls the thug Poeasa and together they plan to kill Dasima. One night, as Dasima goes to hear a story-telling, the two accost her, kill her, and throw her body off a bridge. Samioen and Poeasa are later caught and sentenced to hang for their crime.|$|E
5|$|The River Don, which {{flows through}} Sheffield and Doncaster, had {{originally}} {{split into two}} channels below Stainforth, one of which emptied into the River Trent near Adlingfleet, close to its junction with the River Ouse, while the other headed north to join the River Aire near Rawcliffe. Following {{the work of the}} Dutch drainage engineer Cornelius Vermuyden to drain Hatfield Chase, the Adlingfleet outlet was closed off, and the channel to the River Aire, passing through Newbridge, was improved to <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the flow. The scheme was not entirely successful, and after severe flooding near Sykehouse, Fishlake and Snaith, accompanied by riots, a new channel was cut between Newbridge and the River Ouse near what became Goole. The old course of the Don gradually silted up. Navigation on the Don was improved by the construction of cuts and locks, with the lowest lock situated at Stainforth. From there to the Ouse, boats used the Dutch River, Vermuyden's artificial drain, which was hazardous due to its fast flows, its tides and its shallowness at times.|$|E
25|$|The next year, the Romans {{shifted their}} {{attention}} to the north-west. They sent a naval expedition toward Lilybaeum. En route, the Romans seized and burned the Carthaginian hold-out cities of Selinous and Heraclea Minoa. This expedition to Lilybaeum was not successful, but attacking the Carthaginian headquarters demonstrated Roman resolve to <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Sicily. The Roman fleet was defeated by the Carthaginians at Drepana, forcing the Romans to continue their attacks from land. Roman forces at Lilybaeum were relieved, and Eryx, near Drepana, was seized thus menacing that important city as well.|$|E

25|$|On 30 August-1 September, Young {{met with}} Indian {{delegations}} {{and gave them}} permission to <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the livestock then on {{the northern and southern}} trails into California (the Fancher Party was at that time on the southern trail). This meeting may have been Young's attempt to win Indian support against the United States and refrain from raids against Mormon settlements. In sermons on 16 August, and again one month later, Young publicly urged the emigrant wagon trains to keep away from the Territory. Despite Young's efforts, Indians attacked Mormon settlements {{during the course of the}} Utah War, including a raid on Fort Limhi on the Salmon River in Oregon Territory in February 1858 and attacks in Tooele County just west of Great Salt Lake City.|$|E

25|$|Within , the {{destruction}} of the Citadel's reactor has started a chain reaction that will <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> City 17 with it. Aided in part by the G-Man and the Vortigaunt, Freeman and Alyx escape the primary explosions and work to try to slow the reaction, giving the surviving humans the time needed to escape the city. However, they find that the Combine are attempting to accelerate the process, in part to alert the off-world Combine forces to their plight. Freeman and his allies safely make their way out of City 17 in time. In , the massive explosion has created a superportal which could allow the full Combine force onto Earth. G-Man provides Freeman with the appropriate information on how to close the portal, as well as the location of the Borealis, a ship used by Aperture Science used to test humanity's own version of portal technology. Freeman and his allies help to secure safety for the human survivors from City 17, and launch a satellite to shut down the superportal in time. Just as they are about to set off to locate the Borealis, a Combine Advisor appears and kills Eli, leaving Alyx in tears.|$|E
25|$|Ribault {{returned}} {{at once to}} {{the fort}} and, entering the chamber of Laudonnière, who lay there sick, proposed in his presence {{and that of the}} assembled captains and other gentlemen, to embark at once with all of his forces in the four ships which lay in the harbor, for the Trinity had not yet returned, and to seek the Spanish fleet. Laudonnière, who was familiar with the sudden storms to which the region was subject during September, disapproved of his plan, pointing out the danger to which the French ships would be exposed of being driven out to sea, and the defenseless condition in which Fort Caroline would be left. The captains, who had received from a neighboring chief confirmation of the landing of the Spaniards and of the defenses which they were erecting, also advised against Ribault's plan, and counselled him at least to await the return of the Trinity before executing it. But Ribault persisted in his plan, showed the unwilling Laudonnière Coligny's instructions, and proceeded to carry it into effect. Not only did he <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his own men with him, but carried off thirty-eight of the garrison and Laudonnière's ensign, leaving behind his treasurer, the Sieur de Lys, with the sick lieutenant in charge of the depleted garrison.|$|E
500|$|Command then devolved upon Major General Hoàng Thế Thiện. In December 1974 {{the first}} phase of a limited PAVN {{offensive}} in South Vietnam began. Its success inspired Hanoi to try for an expanded but still limited, offensive to improve its bargaining position with Saigon. In March, General Văn Tiến Dũng launched [...] "Campaign 275", the success of which prompted the general to push Hanoi for a final all-out offensive to <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> South Vietnam.

500|$|As part of Why Not? with Shania Twain, she {{arranged}} a session with music producer David Foster, hoping to collaborate on [...] "Today Is Your Day". Although she felt skeptical, Twain visited vocal coach Eric Vetro {{to prepare for}} her session with Foster. Twain and Vetro executed vocal exercises to loosen up the tension and tightness in her vocal chords. [...] "The goal is to free up, to let go. She has to <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> that tension and tightness that she's been feeling for so long, and transform it to free herself from it. And to start singing from her heart again, {{the way she did}} {{when she was a little}} girl, when she started," [...] Vetro stated. He also opined that Twain was ready to return to her music career. Twain learned beneficial vocal techniques and appreciated Vetro's understanding of her psyche.|$|E
500|$|Further, {{in attacking}} the {{distortion}} principle's application, Gozdor also argued against the principle {{as a legal}} concept in the first place. He wrote, [...] "Regardless of the Court's rationale for its distortion principle, determining a First Amendment violation by measuring whether the government used a subsidy 'in ways which distorted the medium's usual functioning' suggests that forum functions become unchangeable once created." [...] He claimed the unworkability of the distortion principle in a hypothetical example, which would moot {{the very existence of}} the Legal Services Corporation. [...] "Taking the Velazquez rationale to its logical ends", he wrote, [...] "the LSC subsidy itself could become an unconstitutional speech restriction. If Congress substantially increased LSC appropriations in order to allow LSC to <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> its cases ... the functioning of the legal system would be distorted because such a subsidy likely would result in a dramatic increase in the federal courts' caseloads." [...] With this in mind, he concluded with a process by which the Court should have decided the case: a process leading to the upholding of the restriction by finding that LSC's purpose was in promoting the government's message, in contrast to a diversity of private views.|$|E
500|$|Joss Whedon {{said that}} his {{previous}} television shows were based on ensembles, with S.H.I.E.L.D. being {{based in part on}} the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode [...] "The Zeppo". That episode highlighted a lesser seen character, which was something he wanted to achieve with the character of Agent Phil Coulson. It was written by Whedon, along with his brother Jed Whedon and sister-in-law Maurissa Tancharoen. At the same time, he was writing the script for , which meant that he could use the series to explain the resurrection of Coulson rather than trying to include it in that film. Whedon revealed that he received notes from ABC on things to change in the pilot, but noted that the network was encouraging and excited about the project, so [...] "you take the notes. You don’t <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them. But you never walk in expecting not to get any." [...] At San Diego Comic-Con 2013, Tancharoen talked about telling a Marvel story on a television budget, calling it a challenge but noting that the series is [...] "looking at it through a different lens", telling the human stories in the superhuman universe, with Coulson, who was the human, grounded character in the films, leading a team of 'real people', albeit extremely skilled people.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{new album}} came back in 2010, as {{frontman}} Dave Grohl was touring Australia with Them Crooked Vultures. Grohl decided that [...] "we should make a documentary about the recording of this new album {{and make it a}} history of the band too. Rather than just record the album in the most expensive studio with the most state-of-the-art equipment, what if Butch and I were to get back together after 20 years and dust off the tape machines and put them in my garage?" [...] Grohl later elaborated that Vig was brought in so the record could be [...] "that one album that kinda defines the band: it might not be their best album, but it's the one people identify the band with the most, like Back In Black or the Metallica Black Album. It's like you <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the things that people consider your band's signature characteristics and just amplify them and make one simple album with that. And that's sorta what I thought we could do with Butch, because Butch has a great way of trimming all the fat and making sense of it all." [...] Grohl also used the tour with the Vultures to turn song ideas into demos, which were then brought to drummer Taylor Hawkins to be further developed. The album would also mark the return of guitarist Pat Smear as a permanent member; Smear left the Foo Fighters after the release of The Colour and the Shape, but {{had been part of the}} touring band since 2006.|$|E
500|$|In 1980, Buczynski and Muto went on {{a package}} holiday to Greece, further inspiring the former's {{interests}} in the region's ancient cultures. Deciding to explore this topic further, he enrolled to study for an undergraduate degree in Classics and Ancient History at Hunter College, {{a part of the}} City University of New York (CUNY) located in Manhattan's Upper East Side, beginning there in September 1980. At the university, he became friends with one of his mentors, the classical archaeologist Clairève Grandjouan, and was saddened by her death before he had completed the course. He devoted himself to his studies, which he greatly enjoyed, and was sufficiently successful to be placed on the Thomas Hunter Honors Program. In June 1982, he returned to Greece in order to take part in his first archaeological excavations, which were run by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (ASCSA). Returning to New York City, he began to <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the modules that he could which were devoted to field archaeology, considering a potential career in the profession. In the winter break between 1982 and 1983, he once more returned to the Mediterranean, [...] touring Greece and Italy with Muto. He would subsequently be laid off from his job, but gained work in the Hunter College Classics Office. His increased interest in academic archaeology came at the expense of his involvement in the occult, and in the Spring of 1981 he stepped down from his leadership of the Knossos Grove coven, handing control over to Tony Fiara. As his studies at Hunter College came to an end, he decided to continue his education to a postgraduate level, and successfully obtained a scholarship from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.|$|E
