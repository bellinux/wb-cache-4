50|$|The {{endocrine}} system is affected largely by many {{internal and external}} stimuli. One internal stimulus that causes hormone release is blood pressure.

50|$|Descartes, {{influenced}} by the Automatons on display throughout the city of Paris, began to investigate {{the connection between the}} mind and body. The main influences for Dualism were theology and physics and how the two interact. Descartes in his Passions of the Soul and The Description of the Human Body suggested that the body works like a machine, that it has material properties. The mind (or soul), on the other hand, was described as a nonmaterial and does not follow the laws of nature. Descartes argued that the mind interacts with the body at the pineal gland. This form of dualism or duality proposes that the mind controls the body, but that <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> influence the otherwise rational mind, such as when people act out of passion.

TB mainly affects lungs of patients but {{other parts of}} <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be affected. It kills approximately 2 million people annually. HIV/AIDS and drug resistance make TB difficult to control. Mtb CarD protein forms a physiological complex with Ribonucleic Acid Polymerase (RNAP). This complex causes Mtb to undergo dormancy rendering it difficult to control using current antibiotics. CarD and a size-reduced subunit β 1 (denoted β 1 m for “minimized”) of Thermus thermophilus RNAP, in which the central domain {{has been replaced by}} a Gly-Gly linker, were produced and purified using affinity nickel nitrilotriaceticacid and glutathione-Stransferase (GST) affinity chromatography techniques respectively. CarD N terminal domain (CarDN) was generated from CarD by inserting a stop codon by site directed mutagenesis. CarD was stabilised by adding 5 % (v/v) glycerol to PBS pH 7. 4 ensuring protein stability of up to 67 days rather than 2 days without glycerol. CarDN was stable in PBS pH 7. 4 without addition of glycerol. This suggests that the CarD C terminal domain may be responsible for CarD instability. To further purify the proteins both anion exchange and gel permeation chromatography techniques were used. CarD and CarDN degrade immediately after anion exchange potentially because of the high ion concentration which partially unfolds the protein making it prone to proteolytic cleavage. GST-pull down assays were used to demonstrate complex formation between RNAP β 1 m and both CarD and CarDN confirming that complex formation is dependent on the N-terminal domain of CarD...|$|E
40|$|The carotid-cardiac baroreflex {{contributes}} {{to the prediction of}} orthostatic tolerance; experimental attenuation of the reflex response leads to orthostatic hypotension in humans and animals. Anecdotal observations indicate that rotational head movements about the vertical axis of <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> induce orthostatic bradycardia and hypotension through increased parasympathetic activity. We therefore measured the chronotropic response to carotid baroreceptor stimulation in 12 men during varying conditions of vestibulo-oculomotor stimulation to test the hypothesis that stimulation of the semicircular canals associated with head movements in the yaw plane inhibits cardioacceleration through a vagally mediated baroreflex. Carotid-cardiac baroreflex response was assessed by plotting R-R intervals (ms) at each of 8 neck pressure steps with their respective carotid distending pressures (mmHg). Calculated baroreflex gain (maximal slope of the stimulus-response relationship) was measured under 4 experimental conditions: 1) sinusoidal whole-body yaw rotation of the subject in the dark without visual fixation (combined vestibular-oculomotor stimulation); 2) yaw oscillation of the subject while tracking a small head-fixed light moving with the subject (vestibular stimulation without eye movements); 3) subject stationary while fixating on a small light oscillating in yaw at the same frequency, peak acceleration, and velocity as the chair (eye movements without vestibular stimulation); and 4) subject stationary in the dark (no eye or head motion). Head motion alone and with eye movement reduced baseline baroreflex responsiveness to the same stimulus by 30 %. Inhibition of cardioacceleration during rotational head movements may have significant impact on functional performance in aerospace environments, particularly in high-performance aircraft pilots during high angular acceleration in aerial combat maneuvers or in astronauts upon return from spaceflight who already have attenuated baroreflex functions...|$|E

Because of its chemical properties 9 ̆ 7 namely, its oxidative potential 9 ̆ 7 iron functions in several biological systems that are crucial to human health. Iron, which is not easily eliminated from <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> cause harm through oxidative stress, interference with the absorption or metabolism of other nutrients, and suppression of critical enzymatic activities. We reviewed 26 randomized controlled trials of preventive, oral iron supplementation in young children (aged 09 ̆ 659 mo) living in developing countries to ascertain the associated health benefits and risks. The outcomes investigated were anemia, development, growth, morbidity, and mortality. Initial hemoglobin concentrations and iron status were considered as effect modifiers, although few studies included such subgroup analyses. Among iron-deficient or anemic children, hemoglobin concentrations were improved with iron supplementation. Reductions in cognitive and motor development deficits were observed in iron-deficient or anemic children, particularly with longer-duration, lower-dose regimens. With iron supplementation, weight gains were adversely affected in iron-replete children; the effects on height were inconclusive. Most studies found no effect on morbidity, although few had sample sizes or study designs that were adequate for drawing conclusions. In a malaria-endemic population of Zanzibar, significant increases in serious adverse events were associated with iron supplementation, whereas, in Nepal, no effects on mortality in young children were found. More research is needed in populations affected by HIV and tuberculosis. Iron supplementation in preventive programs {{may need to be}} targeted through identification of iron-deficient children...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} BA thesis was {{to study}} the {{perception}} of body {{and its relation to}} consumer culture among young urban women in Estonia. Although the thesis relates to many other works that map different dimensions of consumer culture in Estonia – especially Margit Keller’s PhD thesis and Katrin Rahu’s MA thesis - it is the first to connect the subjects of body and consumer culture. The theoretical part gives an overview of the naturalistic and constructivist approaches to the body in current social theory. Consumer culture as a concept is defined and the relations between body and consumer culture are considered. The works of Anthony Giddens, Pierre Bourdieu, Jean Baudrillard, Mike Featherstone, Zygmunt Bauman, Chris Shilling and Michel Foucault form {{a significant part of the}} theoretical basis for the study, as does the research carried out at Tartu University. To tackle the research problem, qualitative approach of data collection and analysis was used. Ten semi-structured in-depth interviews with 18 - 29 year old women living in Tallinn and Tartu formed a basis for empirical analysis. Qualitative content analysis method, drawing mainly on Miles and Huberman, was applied to interpret the interviews. The study aimed to find answers to the following research questions: 1) What are the body-related practices, consumed goods and services and applied strategies of young urban women?; 2) What are the body-related values of young urban women?; 3) Which beliefs and conceptions manifest themselves through what and how young urban women say about their bodies?; 4) Based on the previous, what can be said about the relation of young urban women, their bodies and consumer culture? On the basis of the analysis it can be concluded that body maintenance forms an important part of the lives of young urban women and the scope of body-related practices is very wide. Those practices usually presuppose consumption and may be organized into purposeful and reflexive strategies. Certain care of one’s body is considered elementary; the content of this minimal norm is among other things dependent on the space, options, goals and roles of the person. “Beauty”, “youth” and “health” are important body-related values for the young urban women, but such notions like “harmony”, “balance” and “wholeness” are also given remarkable consideration. In sum, their views are characterized by certain ambiguity concerning which values are considered terminal and which are instrumental. The belief that one’s body can be changed and shaped and that it is one’s responsibility to do so, is widespread among young urban women. The body is often seen as capital that gives access to other types of capital. But <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be interpreted as something “given“ or “natural”, something that one must live with in peace and harmony. This BA thesis describes two ways of giving meaning to the body that exist among the interviewees: “body as a project“ and “natural body“. Those constructions are ideal types that in real life intertwine and form different combinations. Certainly these two types do not include all aspects of how young urban women perceive the body, but represent two clearest patterns of thought that emerged during this study. Both aforementioned ways of constructing the body have its own relation to consumption, based on their inner logic. Neither of them presumes nor excludes consumption, but both determine the reasoning behind consuming or not consuming. Though consumption and thinking about the body cannot be separated, protest against consumption and consumer culture exists. In conclusion it can be said that consumer culture theory can be fruitfully used to study the body and its meaning in contemporary Estonia. But to get an adequate picture of the research subject, other social groups ought to be studied and different theoretical approaches should be used...|$|E
40|$|Problem Pregnancy is a {{sensitive}} {{period in the}} life of a woman. Changes occur to organic, hormonal, and immunologic processes of adaptation prior to the development of the birth of the child. Complications often arise at this stage of pregnancy, such as abort, whose cause is often not medically explainable. It is assumed that psychosocial stress factors such as stress, have a decisive influence on the development of the fetus, especially the biological processes in <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be affected by stress. The aim of this study was to develop a measuring method (screening instrument) and to evaluate its efficiency to show correlations between psychosocial stress and pregnancy complications. With the evidence of an association the stress levels of pregnant women could be measured as a prognostic factor for pregnancy complications, so that in the future physicians could recognize women with high levels of stress, treat and prevent possible pregnancy complications. The developed diagnostic tool consists of in research and practice established questionnaires to capture the potential psychosocial stress, which could be associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications. The questionnaire "Psychosocial well-being in early pregnancy" includes a first section in which the general medical and demographic information is collected and a second part, with the selected standardized instruments, such as the PSQ for stress perception, depression and anxiety module PHQ D and GAD- 7, the PFB for the assessment of the partnership in terms of tenderness, common, communication and conflict, the F-Sozu for the collection of social support, the GSF to pregnancy One´s outlook and fears, and the MEL for the detection of life events. Nine months later, the women were interviewed in the form of a second questionnaire on the outcome of pregnancy. The purpose-designed questionnaire collected general information on the pregnancy and contains questions about the complications that occurred. The working hypothesis was that the developed instrument can identify an increased level of stress and its predictive value can be demonstrated to pregnancy complications. Methods For evaluation of the instrument, a prospective longitudinal study was conducted. 197 pregnant women in the first trimester responded to the developed questionnaire for psychological and social factors, in order to capture stress levels before and during the first weeks of pregnancy occurring [...] Nine months later the women were questioned with the second questionnaire about the outcome of their pregnancy and any pregnancy complications that occurred. To get a maximum audience at the second interview and to clarify medically the responses of women, the treating physicians were also interviewed to their patients' outcome. Using a regression analysis, the categorized exposure levels(low, medium, high) set the individual constructs in relation to the pregnancy outcome and calculates the forecast values. The pregnancy outcomes have been categorized in uncomplicated pregnancies and pregnancies with complications. Result In this study the used measurement instrument could not show a significant predictive value of stress on pregnancy complications. The majority of questions, including the PSQ, the general perception of stress, did not show correlations. There were certain points in each sub-scale which showed significant values. This was true when asked to comment on planning pregnancy, work stress, social support, self-efficacy, anxiety and attitudes toward birth pregnancy. The negative effects of excessive workload, lack of social support, and negative attitudes towards pregnancy are understandable. Irritating was that the majority of the listed psychosocial stress factors, such as commonly perceived stress, partnership deficits, stressful life events and depression, which can also suggest a negative relationship show no correlation. Conclusion The measuring method for the quantification of stress is, in accordance with the present results, not able to predict pregnancy complications, and to initiate appropriate treatment of women. Although individual subscales showing significant associations between psychosocial stress factors and pregnancy complications, there is no reliable overall picture. It can be suspected, that there is a connection, however it does not explain the inconsistent results of this study. This raises the questions whether the measurement of stress with self quantifying questionnaires is an appropriate method to determine the cause of pregnancy complications. There are likely complex factors that are not measurable. Standardized questionnaires, used primarily in psychology, certainly allow the measurement of stress levels. The question is whether stress is perceived positively or negatively and how stress interacts with the individual organism of the pregnant women includes a complexity that can possibly be detected only in a limited way by self-assessment questionnaires. The inclusion of biological parameters could be an alternative method to provide clearer results. It has been shown that exposure to stress, leads to an imbalance of the endocrine, nervous and immunological parameters. Thus, for example, the determination of cortisol or progesterone in combination with an adapted questionnaire based survey may provide more specific medically usable results...|$|E
