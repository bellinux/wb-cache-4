25|$|<b>This</b> <b>Teacher</b> of Righteousness {{does not}} feature at all, however, in the Community Rule, another {{document}} found amongst the Qumran scrolls. To some scholars, {{this suggests that}} the two works are of different Second Temple groups. Most scholars, however, focus on the high degree of shared terminology and legal rulings between the Damascus Document and the Community Rule, including terms like sons of light, and their penal codes and on the likelihood that fragment 4Q265 is a hybrid edition of both documents. They turn {{to the fact that the}} Damascus Document describes the group amongst whom the Document was created as having been leaderless for 20 years before the Teacher of Righteousness established his rule over the group to explain that both works are from the same group under different situations.|$|E
25|$|Typically, primary {{education}} {{is provided in}} schools, where the child will stay in steadily advancing classes until they complete it {{and move on to}} secondary schooling. Children are usually placed in classes with one teacher who will be primarily responsible for their education and welfare for that year. <b>This</b> <b>teacher</b> may be assisted to varying degrees by specialist teachers in certain subject areas, often music or physical education. The continuity with a single teacher and the opportunity to build up a close relationship with the class is a notable feature of the {{primary education}} system. Pursuant to The Education Act, school attendance is compulsory for {{children between the ages of}} 7 and 16 years. In addition, schooling is provided to anyone between the ages of 6 to 21 years.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay has been to {{identify}} {{a couple of different}} factors that matter when a teacher chooses method and raw material for teaching his students. The person interviewed is a man, whose lesson I also observed. The result shows that there are several factors of great importance for his choice. My conclusion of this is that <b>this</b> <b>teacher’s</b> choice depends on the school as institution with all the people that operate there, the composition of the students and the school’s curriculum, but <b>this</b> <b>teacher’s</b> pedagogical basic view also has a great importance for his teaching...|$|R

2500|$|The Gospels may be {{regarded}} as myth or legendary fiction which have imposed [...] "a fictitious historical narrative" [...] on a [...] "mythical cosmic savior figure". According to Wells, a minimally historical Jesus existed, whose teachings were preserved in the Q document. According to Wells, the Gospels weave together two Jesus narratives, namely Paul's mythical Jesus and the Galilean preacher of the Q document. Doherty disagrees with Wells regarding <b>this</b> <b>teacher</b> of the Q-document, arguing {{that he was an}} allegoral character who personified Wisdom and came to {{be regarded}} as the founder of the Q-community. According to Doherty, Q's Jesus and Paul's Christ were combined in the Gospel of Mark by a predominantly Gentile community.|$|E

He recalled his early years of family life as being of [...] "extreme tension" [...] which he noted between his parents, whom he observed to be constantly arguing with each other. At elementary school, he was regarded as both quiet and timid by his peers. On his first grade report card, one teacher described Dahmer as a reserved child whom she sensed felt neglected. <b>This</b> <b>teacher</b> did note that this sense of neglect seemed to stem from his mother's illnesses. Nonetheless, although largely reserved and uncommunicative in grade school, Dahmer did have a small number of friends.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to obtain more {{information}} from a possible chronicles and residual memories, Radivoje Ljubinković, during archeological works, was conducted a questionnaire among the oldest inhabitants of the village.

He recorded the legend, that the main church in the village was the church of St. Jovan the Baptist, once located near the present cemetery and after its demolition, church of St. Petka became a village temple.

2500|$|Cousin {{wanted to}} lecture on {{philosophy}} and quickly obtained {{the position of}} master of conferences (maître de conférences) in the school. The second great philosophical impulse of his life was the teaching [...] of Pierre Paul Royer-Collard. <b>This</b> <b>teacher,</b> he tells us, [...] "by the severity of his logic, the gravity and weight of his words, turned me by degrees, and not without resistance, from the beaten path of Condillac into the way which has since become so easy, but which was then painful and unfrequented, that of the Scottish philosophy." [...] The [...] "Scottish Philosophy" [...] being the [...] "Common Sense" [...] Philosophy of Thomas Reid and others - which taught that both the external world and the human mind (introspection proving the existence of [...] "free will" [...] by the fact of consciousness) had an objective existence.

40|$|Abstract]: This paper traces {{reflective}} practices {{through the}} lens of criticality as a commonality of mindset and action in relation to a teacher’s experience within a Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Brisbane, Australia. This experience spans a period of 13 years, in which the efficacy of <b>this</b> <b>teacher’s</b> praxis was put to the test and personally questioned. The paper highlights the recurrence of the theme “critical” within <b>this</b> <b>teacher’s</b> professional career, along with personally significant ideological beliefs and values. The significance of this journey is that it highlights for others how one’s philosophy of action can keep one afloat in what some would suggest is an oppressive work environment. It also articulates the utility of criticality in one teacher’s struggle within a vocational education and training workplace...|$|R

60|$|Her audacity was as {{the audacity}} of fools. Where wisdom, full-fledged, might have halted, trembling, she swept resolutely onward.

Yet out of the tiny pittance of her knowledge and her little intellectual sight--which was no better than a blindness--must she confidently tell him that he was at fault.|$|E

Then they learned that, unknown {{to any of the}} girls, one of the teachers had been delegated by Miss Garwood, the head of the academy, to make a quiet investigation concerning the proposed sleighing party. And when <b>this</b> <b>teacher</b> had found out who were on the committee of arrangements, Miss Garwood had forbidden any of the young ladies to participate. When this became known, Brassy Bangs had at once concluded that Jack--and perhaps some of his relatives and friends--was responsible for what had occurred. The party had been called off.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>teacher</b> of men, this Oxford pundit, this double-distilled quintessence of {{university}} perfection, this writer of religious treatises, this speaker of ecclesiastical speeches, {{had been like}} a little child in her hands; she had turned him inside out and read his very heart as she might have done that of a young girl. She could not but despise him for his facile openness, and yet she liked him for it, too. It was a novelty to her, a new trait in a man's character. She felt also that she could never so completely {{make a fool of}} him as she did of the Slopes and Thornes. She felt that she never could induce Mr. Arabin to make protestations to her that were not true, or to listen to nonsense that was mere nonsense.|$|E

50|$|Apart from <b>this,</b> <b>teachers</b> {{are often}} not given {{sufficient}} opportunities for professional growth or promotions.

There was an English lady we met in the cars--I think her name was Miss Featherstone; perhaps you know her.

60|$|It will be {{observed}} too, {{that all the}} time <b>this</b> <b>teacher</b> was performing these experiments, and watching, with intense interest, the results, his pupils were going on undisturbed in their pursuits. The exercises in writing were not interrupted or deranged. This is a point of fundamental importance; for, if what I should say on the subject of exercising ingenuity and contrivance in teaching, should be the means, in any case, of leading a teacher to break in upon the regular duties of his school, and destroy the steady uniformity with which the great objects of such an institution should be pursued, my remarks had better never have been written. There may be variety in methods and plan; but through all this variety, the school, and every individual pupil of it, must go steadily forward in the acquisition of that knowledge which is of greatest importance in the business of future life. In other words, the variations and changes, admitted by the teacher, ought to be mainly confined to the modes of accomplishing those permanent objects to which all the exercises and arrangements of the school ought steadily to aim. More on this subject however in another chapter.|$|E
