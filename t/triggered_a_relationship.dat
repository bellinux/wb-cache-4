40|$|We {{present and}} discuss {{a series of}} {{experiments}} designed to test {{one of the most}} promising pragmatic accounts of conditional perfection—the phenomenon according to which conditionals can sometimes be strengthened to biconditionals. We test the idea that conditional perfection is a form of exhaustification triggered by the kind of question that the conditional is used to answer. We uncover evidence that conditional perfection is a form of exhaustification, but not that it is <b>triggered</b> by <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> to <b>a</b> salient question. ...|$|R
40|$|The idea of striving drew me to Alexander Ostrovsky's The Storm. I saw in it a {{community}} in which fear stands between who the characters feel themselves to be and what they might offer the world around them. The core of our production emerged from the question: &ldquoIs it possible to live truthfully in this world?&rdquo We created a space that reflected corrosion, {{the power of the}} natural world, and the potential for connection between this world and something higher. Our long pool {{through the center of the}} space split the audience in two, and created an inescapable presence of water for the characters to contend with. We hung wind chimes made from metal gate pieces to <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> between the natural world and the impact of the actors' own movements. The space was flat, with the exception of a ladder reaching to the balcony level of the theatre, and a telephone pole that stretched up past the grid. These upward-reaching elements suggested the aspiration towards another way of life, or ultimately, another realm. Similarly, Kuligan's machine used the discarded objects of the world, and (without consuming it) the water, to bring light into the space. In the final moments of the play, we saw Katya, climb endlessly up the pole, and watched the wheel on Kuligan's broken perpetual motion machine spin. Watching, we sensed that however ridiculous, dangerous or futile dreams of flying (like Katya's) and of perpetual motion (like Kuligan's) may seem, endeavors like theirs are our vital hope against corrosion...|$|R
5000|$|The {{importance}} of archaeological sites and materials to Indigenous peoples’ case for their uninterrupted occupation of colonized lands cannot be overestimated: [...] "control of cultural property {{is central to}} the struggle of decolonization, aboriginal self-government, and in some areas, First Nations cultural survival" [...] (Walker and Ostrove 1995: 14). As archeology provides incontrovertible material related to past events, First Nations peoples are beginning to consider archeology as a practice they can use, rather than as a colonialist project or bureaucratic obstacle course. Archaeological sites and objects may serve the philosophy and process of decolonization; for instance, being used to negotiate land claims or to promote cultural cohesion. Indigenous groups have begun to insist on control of such resources in their transition toward self-determination (Walker and Ostrove 1995). <b>A</b> <b>relationship</b> is seen between archaeology and nationalism. According to Kohl and Fawcett, as well as <b>Trigger,</b> such <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> is [...] "not necessarily corrupt or intrinsically suspect," [...] any more than it was when European-Americans were making all the decisions about archeological sites and materials.(Kohl and Fawcett 1995: 3; also Trigger 1983).|$|R
50|$|Cram down is barred if {{a junior}} {{interest}} (old equity) holder under a proposed Chapter 11 plan receives or retains property “on account of” such junior interest. 11 U.S.C. 1129(b)(2)(B). The Court, considering whether {{the language of}} the statute implied a new value exception, found “on account of” not to mean “in exchange for” or “in satisfaction of” but rather should be interpreted to mean “because of.” Therefore, the absolute priority rule is <b>triggered</b> by <b>a</b> causal <b>relationship</b> between holding the prior claim or interest and receiving or retaining property. The Court neither decided whether the statute included a new value exception, nor decided whether the exception exists at all.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, Van Eijk {{was sentenced}} to 18 years {{imprisonment}} and TBS. The details of the murders, as revealed during the trial, were so horrifying that several judiciary guards vomited. Psychiatric reports explained that Van Eijk had severe childhood trauma {{as a result of}} bullying and rejection by women. During his therapy at the Van Mesdagkliniek, psychiatrists speculated that his deviant behavior was the result of brain damage sustained during his birth. In 1980, while still in remand, he married his penfriend Adri. In 1990 he was released and together they moved into a house in Harkstede. Psychiatrists believed that his relationship with Adri would prevent him from reoffending, but warned that subsequent female rejections could <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> relapse. The <b>relationship</b> {{turned out to be a}} downward spiral for Van Eijk.|$|R

40|$|Soil {{and plant}} {{environment}} {{is characterized by}} a wide range of microorganisms able to interact with host plants and, in some cases, to differentially induce susceptibility or resistance to pathogens. Plant viruses cause chlorosis and necrosis, so decreasing plant growth and productivity. Differently, many fungi are able to <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> beneficial <b>relationship</b> with plants. Trichoderma spp. are endophytic symbionts able to modify plants metabolism, increasing nutrient uptake by plants and photosynthetic efficiency, and protecting them from pathogens. A biopolymer able to elicit plant-immunity is chitosan, derived by the deacetylation of chitin, a component of some fungal cell walls. Chitosan improves the host hypersensitive response by the expression of pathogenesis-related proteins and the synthesis of secondary metabolites. Trichoderma harzianum T- 22 (T 22) induces defense responses against Cucumber mosaic virus Fny (CMV) in Solanum lycopersicum. On this basis, the aim of this work was to determine if the combination T 22 -chitosan has an antiviral activity against CMV in tomato plants. Plant physiological parameters (gas exchange, chlorophyll content and fluorescence) were followed throughout the experiment. Furthermore, ELISA test was employed to detect CMV. Results indicate that plants treated with T 22 and chitosan had a strong attenuation of viral load, a higher chlorophyll content and a better photosynthetic performance compared to the untreated plants. Further investigations are in progress to determine plant antioxidant responses. In conclusion, combined treatment based on T 22 and chitosan represents a highly effective strategy against CMV, embracing the criteria of sustainable agricultural practice and public health protection...|$|R

40|$|Innovative thinkers {{within the}} access-to-justice (ATJ) {{movement}} have {{been experimenting with}} creative ideas for delivering meaningful legal guidance in {{an efficient way to}} clients struggling with civil legal needs. These efforts respond to the long-standing crisis in the delivery of legal services to disadvantaged persons, and the overwhelming need for legal advice in areas such as debt collection, housing, family, and immigration. One such imaginative proposal is what this Article calls “surrogate lawyering. ” This innovation envisions public interest law firms using some scarce lawyer time to train and advise community-based organization (CBO) staff members to respond, in real time and in context, to the legal problems their constituents encounter. Crafted well, and complemented by technological aids being developed by ATJ entrepreneurs, surrogate lawyering could effect a substantial improvement {{in the lives of the}} clients in need. This Article assesses the ethical implications of the surrogate lawyering venture. It concludes that the lawyers who advise the CBO staffers would not inadvertently <b>trigger</b> <b>an</b> attorney-client <b>relationship</b> with the constituents/clients who benefit from the staffer’s guidance. Nor would those lawyers have agency-driven commitments to the constituent/clients. The public interest law firm likely would, though, have attorney-client duties to the CBO, and would need to account for that reality in its operations. The Article does conclude, though, that the surrogacy model generates a significant concern involving the unauthorized practice of law (UPL), and the lawyers’ assistance with that activity. The Article proceeds to critique the UPL concerns, demonstrating that neither the constituent/clients nor the legal profession would be likely to suffer any appreciable harm by permitting surrogate lawyering ventures to operate. The Article closes with suggestions for some adjustments to the usual UPL constraints that would permit surrogate lawyering strategies while minimizing any risks associated with that means of delivering legal advice...|$|R
