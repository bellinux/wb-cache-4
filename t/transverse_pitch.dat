40|$|In this study, {{an entropy}} {{generation}} minimization procedure is employed {{to optimize the}} overall performance (thermal and hydrodynamic) of isolated fin geometries and pin-fin heat sinks. This allows the combined effects of thermal resistance and pressure drop to be assessed simultaneously as the heat sink interacts with the surrounding flow field. New general expressions for the entropy generation rate are developed using mass, energy, and entropy balances over an appropriate control volume. The formulation for the dimensionless entropy generation rate is obtained in terms of fin geometry, longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>pitches,</b> pin-fin aspect ratio, thermal conductivity, arrangement of pin-fins, Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. It is shown that the entropy generation rate depends on two main performance parameters, i. e., thermal resistance and the pressure drop, which in turn depend on the average heat transfer and friction coefficients. These coefficients can be taken from fluid flow and heat transfer models. An extensive literature survey reveals that no comprehensive analytical model for {{any one of them}} exists {{that can be used for}} a wide range of Reynolds number, Prandtl number, longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>pitches,</b> and thermal conductivity. This study is one of the first attempts to develop analytical models for the fluid flow and heat transfer from single pins (circular and elliptical) with and without blockage as well as pin-fin arrays (in-line and staggered). These models can be used for the entire laminar flow range, longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>pitches,</b> any material (from plastic composites to copper), and any fluid having Prandtl numbers (≥ 0. 71). In developing these models, it is assumed that the flow is steady, laminar, and fully developed. Furthermore, the heat sink is fully shrouded and the thermophysical properties are taken to be temperature independent. Using an energy balance over the same control volume, the average heat transfer coefficient for the heat sink is also developed, which is a function of the heat sink material, fluid properties, fin geometry, pin-fin arrangement, and longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>pitches.</b> The hydrodynamic and thermal analyses of both in-line and staggered pin-fin heat sinks are performed using parametric variation of each design variable including pin diameter, pin height, approach velocity, number of pin-fins, and thermal conductivity of the material. The present analytical results for single pins (circular and elliptical) and pin-fin-arrays are in good agreement with the existing experimental/numerical data obtained by other investigators. It is shown that the present models of heat transfer and pressure drop can be applied for a wide range of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>pitches,</b> aspect ratios, and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, selected numerical simulations for a single circular cylinder and in-line pin-fin heat sink are also carried out to validate the present analytical models.

50|$|The main {{elements}} of the building are the hall (sanctuary, the main area used for worship), a two-storey entrance area with offices and cloakrooms, and a smaller two-storey block at the rear. For Williams, the site had few of the design challenges {{he was used to}} — no industrial processes to accommodate, no difficult city centre location, no long spans, no exceptional heights or other engineering problems. Instead, this building called for a sensitive architectural solution. Concrete was Williams' material of choice and here he used reinforced concrete, generally only 125mm in thickness, cast in situ behind a cork lining left exposed as the internal wall finish. With this system, he created a series of vertical planes, zig-zagged in plan to enclose the hall, with similarly folded planes for its roof. With a span of 18.3m, the roof is of sufficient <b>transverse</b> <b>pitch</b> for rainwater drainage, so asphalt weatherproofing was not needed. The hall or sanctuary is the centrepiece of the building and it consists of three bays each 6.1m wide, delineated by the folded planes described. The concrete is thickened at the folds, allowing enough strength for the walls to carry the cantilevered galleries, which sit in the Vs of the chevron-plan walls. The two-storey parts of the complex are rectilinear in plan with flat roofs.|$|E

The tubes in heat exchanger consist of some tubes either in-line or staggered arrangements. The heat transfer of three circular tubes arranged in single row is studied numerically to observe the effect of <b>transverse</b> <b>pitch.</b> The flow around the tube, the momentum equation in boundary layer is solved by finite volume method to obtain the velocity distribution. The energy equation is discretized by finite different methods and then solved by the iteration of relaxation method to obtain the temperature fields.

The calculation of velocity and temperature are carried out around the cylinder {{in the middle of}} the arrangement in which the number of nodes increase along longitudinal direction. The results show the local drag friction and the local Nusselt number at the tube surfaces change with <b>transverse</b> <b>pitch.</b> Starting from a certain value of <b>transverse</b> <b>pitch,</b> there is no influence on heat transfers and the tube arrays behave as a single tube.

40|$|Laminar, two-dimensional, constant-property {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} flat {{tube heat exchanger}} devices operating in flow regimes in which self-sustained oscillations occur were performed. The unsteady flow regimes were transition flow regimes characterized by cyclic variations of flow parameters such as stream-wise or cross-stream velocity. A computer code was developed to perform the numerical simulations. Spatial discretization was based upon a Control Volume Finite Element Method (CVFEM). Temporal discretization was based upon a semi-implicit Runge-Kutta method. Double Cyclic conditions were used to limit the numerical domains to one repeating geometric module. Nine geometric domains representing flat tube heat exchanger devices were tested over a range of Reynolds numbers. A maximum Reynolds number (Re) of 2000 was established to keep the study within the transition range. For each domain, a critical Reynolds number (Re_crit) was found such that for Re Re_crit the flow exhibited cyclic oscillations. For the cases tested, the variation in longitudinal pitch had little impact on the Re_crit value for a fixed <b>transverse</b> <b>pitch.</b> However, for a fixed longitudinal pitch, the Re_crit was increased for decreasing <b>transverse</b> <b>pitch.</b> The results demonstrate the importance of using unsteady simulation methods for these cases.

40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: A {{comprehensive}} kinematic {{description of}} rider and saddle movements {{is not yet}} present in the scientific literature. OBJECTIVE: To describe saddle and rider movements {{in a group of}} high-level dressage horses and riders. METHOD: Seven high-level dressage horses and riders were subjected to kinematic measurements while performing collected trot on a treadmill. For analysis a rigid body model for the saddle and core rider segments, projection angles of the rider's extremities and the neck and trunk of the horse, and distances between markers selected to indicate rider position were used. RESULTS: For a majority of the variables measured it was possible to describe a common pattern for the group. Rotations around the <b>transverse</b> axis (<b>pitch)</b> were generally biphasic for each diagonal. During the first half of stance the saddle rotated anti-clockwise and the rider's pelvis clockwise viewed from the right and the rider's lumbar back extended. During the later part of stance and the suspension phase reverse pitch rotations were observed. Rotations of the saddle and core rider segments around the longitudinal (roll) and vertical axes (yaw) changed direction only around time of contact of each diagonal. CONCLUSION: The saddles and riders of high-level dressage horses follow a common movement pattern at collected trot. The movements of the saddle and rider are clearly related to the movements of the horse and saddle movements also seem to be influenced by the rider. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Knowledge about rider and saddle movements can further our understanding of, and hence possibilities to prevent, orthopaedic injuries related to the exposure of the horse to a rider and saddle...|$|R
