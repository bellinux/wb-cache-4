40|$|VIRTUAL PROTOTYPING {{has been}} {{generally}} adopted in product development {{in order to}} minimise the traditional reliance on testing of physical prototypes. It thus constitutes a major step towards solving the conflict of actual increasing development cost and time due to increasing customer demands on one side, {{and the need to}} decrease development cost and time due to increasing competition on the other. Particularly challenging for the off-road equipment industry is that its products, working machines, are complex in architecture. Tightly coupled, non-linear sub-systems of different technical domains make prediction and optimisation of the complete system’s dynamic behaviour difficult. Furthermore, in working machines the human operator is essential for the performance of the total system. Properties such as productivity, fuel efficiency, and operability are all not only dependent on inherent machine properties and working place conditions, but also on how the operator uses the machine. This is an aspect that is traditionally neglected in dynamic simulations, because the modelling needs to be extended beyond the technical system. The research presented in this thesis focuses on wheel loaders, which are representative for working machines. The technical system and the influence of the human operator is analysed, and so-called short loading cycles are described in depth. Two approaches to rule-based simulation models of a wheel loader operator are presented and used in simulations. Both operator models control the machine model by means of engine throttle, lift and <b>tilt</b> <b>lever,</b> steering wheel, and brake only – just as a human operator does. Also, only signals that a human operator can sense are used in the models. It is demonstrated that both operator models are able to adapt to basic variations in workplace setup and machine capability. Thus, a “human element” can be introduced into dynamic simulation of working machines, giving more relevant answers with respect to operator-influenced complete-machine properties such as productivity, fuel efficiency, and operability already in the concept phase of the product development process.

40|$|In {{the modern}} society {{with a variety}} of {{information}} electronic devices, human interfaces increase their importance in a boundary of a human and a device. In general, the human is required {{to get used to the}} device. Even if the device is designed as a universal device or a high-usability device, the device is not suitable for all users. The usability of the device depends on the individual user. Therefore, personalized and customized human interfaces are effective for the user. To create customized interfaces, we propose rapid prototyping human interfaces using stretchable strain sensors. The human interfaces comprise parts formed by a three-dimensional printer and the four strain sensors. The three-dimensional printer easily makes customized human interfaces. The outputs of the interface are calculated based on the sensor’s lengths. Experiments evaluate three human interfaces: a sheet-shaped interface, a sliding lever interface, and a <b>tilting</b> <b>lever</b> interface. We confirm that the three human interfaces obtain input operations with a high accuracy...|$|R

40|$|SummaryMuscle force {{results from}} the {{interaction}} of the globular heads of myosin-II with actin filaments. We studied the structure-function relationship in the myosin motor in contracting muscle fibers by using temperature jumps or length steps combined with time-resolved, low-angle X-ray diffraction. Both perturbations induced simultaneous changes in the active muscle force and in the extent of labeling of the actin helix by stereo-specifically bound myosin heads at a constant total number of attached heads. The generally accepted hypothesis assumes that muscle force is generated solely by <b>tilting</b> of the <b>lever</b> arm, or the light chain domain of the myosin head, about its catalytic domain firmly bound to actin. Data obtained suggest an additional force-generating step: the “roll and lock” transition of catalytic domains of non-stereo-specifically attached heads to a stereo-specifically bound state. A model based on this scheme is described to quantitatively explain the data...|$|R
40|$|Energetic, kinetic {{and oxygen}} {{exchange}} {{experiments in the}} mid- 1980 s and early 1990 s suggested that phosphate (Pi) release from actomyosin-adenosine diphosphate Pi (AM. ADP. Pi) in muscle fibres is linked to force generation and that Pi release is reversible. The transition leading to the force-generating state and subsequent Pi release were hypothesized to be separate, but closely linked steps. Pi shortens single force-generating actomyosin interactions in an isometric optical clamp only if the conditions enable them to last 20 - 40 ms, enough time for Pi to dissociate. Until 2003, the available crystal forms of myosin suggested a rigid coupling between movement of switch II and <b>tilting</b> of the <b>lever</b> arm to generate force, {{but they did not}} explain the reciprocal affinity myosin has for actin and nucleotides. Newer crystal forms and other structural data suggest that closing of the actin-binding cleft opens switch I (presumably decreasing nucleotide affinity). These data are all consistent with the order of events suggested before: myosin. ADP. Pi binds weakly, then strongly to actin, generating force. Then Pi dissociates, possibly further increasing force or sliding...|$|R

Snakes may use tongue {{flicking}} and snout touching {{to locate}} the head-end of immobilized prey, but tongue use is limited when snakes are holding prey after a strike. In this condition, how can they differentiate the anterior and posterior ends of the prey so that they still ingest their prey mainly from the anterior end? To answer the question, I analyzed the prey-handling behavior of Trimeresurus stejnegeri stejnegeri (Viperidae: Crotalinae) in the laboratory. Following the capture of a prey, T. s. stejnegeri lifted the prey from the ground. The prey thus hung in the air, with the body <b>tilted,</b> like a <b>lever</b> with the fulcrum {{at the site of}} the bite. In most cases, the snake gradually maneuvered its jaw to the higher end of the prey and began ingesting it. As an adaptation for arboreal feeding, the direction of prey ingestion in T. s. stejnegeri depended largely on the location of the initial bite site, under the proposed action of gravity. A significantly greater proportion of frogs (42. 1 %) were struck in the posterior region than mice (9. 6 %). The ratio of prey ingested from the anterior to the posterior ends was 54 : 19 for mice and 24 : 14 for frogs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMyosin crystal {{structures}} have {{given rise to}} the swinging lever arm hypothesis, which predicts a large axial <b>tilt</b> of the <b>lever</b> arm domain during the actin-attached working stroke. Previous work imaging the working stroke in actively contracting, fast-frozen Lethocerus muscle confirmed the axial tilt; but strongly bound myosin heads also showed an unexpected azimuthal slew of the lever arm around the thin filament axis, which was not predicted from known {{crystal structures}}. We hypothesized that an azimuthal reorientation of the myosin motor domain on actin during the weak-binding to strong-binding transition could explain the lever arm slew provided that myosin’s α-helical coiled-coil subfragment 2 (S 2) domain emerged from the thick filament backbone at a particular location. However, previous studies did not adequately resolve the S 2 domain. Here we used electron tomography of rigor muscle swollen by low ionic strength to pull S 2 clear of the thick filament backbone, thereby revealing the azimuth of its point of origin. The results show that the azimuth of S 2 origins of those rigor myosin heads, bound to the actin target zone of actively contracting muscle, originate from a restricted region of the thick filament. This requires an azimuthal reorientation of the motor domain on actin during the weak to strong transition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractForce {{generation}} and movement in skeletal muscle {{result from a}} cyclical interaction of overlapping myosin and actin filaments that permits the free energy of ATP hydrolysis to be converted into mechanical work. The rapid force recovery that occurs after a step release imposed on a muscle is thought to result from a synchronized <b>tilting</b> of myosin <b>lever</b> arms toward a position of lower free energy (the power stroke). We investigated the power stroke mechanism in intact muscle fibers of Rana esculenta using a fast stretch to detach forcibly cross-bridges. Stretches were applied either {{with or without a}} conditioning step release. Cross-bridge rupture tension was not significantly influenced by the release, whereas sarcomere elongation at the rupture point increased immediately after the release and returned to the prerelease condition within 15 – 20 ms, following a slower time course compared to the recovery of tension. These observations suggest that the rupture force of a bridge is unaltered by a conditioning release, but rupture must first be preceded by a power stroke reversal, which restores the prepower stroke state. The sarcomere extension at the rupture point indicates both the extent of this power stroke reversal and the time course of strained bridge replenishment...|$|R
40|$|How receptors {{catalyze}} {{exchange of}} GTP for GDP {{bound to the}} Gα subunit of trimeric G proteins is not known. One proposal is that the receptor uses the G protein's βγ heterodimer as a <b>lever,</b> <b>tilting</b> it to pull open the guanine nucleotide binding pocket of Gα. To test this possibility, we designed a mutant Gα that would bind to βγ in the tilted conformation. To do so, we excised a helical turn (four residues) from the N-terminal region of αs, the α subunit of GS, the stimulatory regulator of adenylyl cyclase. In the presence, {{but not in the}} absence, of transiently expressed β 1 and γ 2, this mutant (αsΔ), markedly stimulated cAMP accumulation. This effect depended on the ability of the coexpressed β protein to interact normally with the lip of the nucleotide binding pocket of αsΔ. We substituted alanine for an aspartate in β 1 that binds to a lysine (K 206) in the lip of the α subunit's nucleotide binding pocket. Coexpressed with αsΔ and γ 2, this mutant, β 1 -D 228 A, elevated cAMP much less than did β 1 -wild type; it did bind to αsΔ normally, however, as indicated by its unimpaired ability to target αsΔ to the plasma membrane. We conclude that βγ can activate αs and that this effect probably involves both a tilt of βγ relative to αs and interaction of β with the lip of the nucleotide binding pocket. We speculate that receptors use a similar mechanism to activate trimeric G proteins...|$|R
