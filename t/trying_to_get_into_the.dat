500|$|Fagerbakke {{has been}} {{compared}} to Patrick's character, which he concurs with. Kenny said that [...] "Bill [...] is a big guy. The world is almost too small for him. He's a force of nature, like Patrick." [...] Writer Jay Lender said, describing Fagerbakke in the recording studio, [...] "Bill Fagerbakke is the most thoughtful performer I've ever seen in the booth—he was always asking questions and really <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mindset, such as it is, of Patrick." [...] Writer Kent Osborne said of Fagerbakke, [...] "He is this big guy, and he plays Patrick so well. He's just this big guy, and he lumbers around." [...] Fagerbakke said, [...] "I'm clumsy. I'm goofy. I make mistakes all the time" [...] and agreed that [...] "I guess I'm a lot of Patrick." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first game}} {{was to begin}} at 6pm CDT, with the second game to follow. Lorelei, a model who did public {{appearances}} for WLUP and who was very popular in Chicago that summer for her sexually provocative poses in the station's advertisements, threw out the first pitch. As the first game began, Mike Veeck got word that {{thousands of people were}} <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> park without tickets. [...] He sent his security personnel to the stadium gates to keep the would-be gate crashers at bay. This left the field unattended, and fans began throwing the uncollected disco LPs and singles from the stands. [...] Tigers designated hitter Rusty Staub remembered that the records would slice through the air, and land sticking out of the ground. [...] He urged teammates to wear batting helmets when playing their positions, [...] "It wasn't just one, it was many. [...] Oh, God almighty, I've never seen anything so dangerous in my life." [...] Attendees also threw firecrackers, empty liquor bottles, and lighters onto the field. The game was stopped several times because of the rain of foreign objects.|$|E

500|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the [...] season, two 90-minute practice sessions were held on Friday and another 60-minute session was held before qualifying on Saturday. In {{the first session}} on Friday morning, Nico Rosberg set the fastest time at 1:07.373. The projected fast lap times were confirmed as Rosberg's time was faster than the previous fastest time set on the track by Michael Schumacher in 2003. Rosberg finished more than three-tenths of a second clear of teammate Lewis Hamilton, with Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen third and fourth respectively, the only other drivers within a second of Rosberg. There were several minor incidents during the session, including Hamilton spinning at turn 3, causing Romain Grosjean {{to go into a}} spin behind him when trying to avoid hitting him. Rosberg also went off the track at the same corner later in the session. Daniel Ricciardo posted the fifth-fastest time, but was lucky to escape a situation in which Marcus Ericsson got sideways while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pitlane entry at turn 8. The revised kerbs of the track caught several drivers out, among them Max Verstappen who lost parts of his front wing when leaving the track at turn 8. Later on, he made contact with the kerbs again in turn 6, damaging his suspension, causing him to end the session early.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{different}} versions {{on how the}} shooting began: some say it began when [...] "Mama Maquín" [...] -an important peasant leader- pushed a soldier who was in her way; others argue that it started because people kept pushing <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> municipality, which was interpreted by the soldiers as an aggression. The mayor at the time, Walter Overdick, said that [...] "people of {{the middle of the}} group pushed those who in front." [...] A witness says one protester grabbed the gun from a soldier but did not use it and several people argue that a military voice yelled: One, two, three! Fire!" [...] In fact, the lieutenant who led the troops gave orders to open fire on the crowd.|$|E
2500|$|Groucho {{himself was}} no help on this point; he was {{discussing}} the Brothers' names during his Carnegie Hall concert, {{and he said}} of his own, [...] "My name, of course, I never did understand." [...] He goes on to mention the possibility that he was named after his unemployed uncle Julius, who lived with his family. The family believed that he was a rich uncle hiding a fortune, and Groucho claimed that he may have been named after him by the family <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> will. [...] "And he finally died, and he left us his will, and in that will he left three razor blades, an 8-ball, a celluloid dicky, and he owed my father $85 beside." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hancock re-recorded {{the tune}} for Head Hunters (1973), {{combining}} synthesizers with a Sly Stone and James Brown funk influence, adding an eight-bar section. Hancock described his composition [...] "Chameleon", also from Head Hunters, to Down Beat magazine in 1979: [...] "In the popular forms of funk, which I've been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into,</b> <b>the</b> attention {{is on the}} rhythmic interplay between different instruments. The part the Clavinet plays has to fit with the part the drums play and the line the bass plays and the line that the guitar plays. It's almost like African drummers where seven drummers play different parts"; [...] "Watermelon Man" [...] shares a similar construction. A live version was released on the double LP Flood (1975), recorded in Japan.|$|E

2500|$|... "Daddy" [...] is {{the second}} single {{released}} from the album. It was the first song that she and Naughty Boy had worked together on and she {{pointed out that the}} song {{has nothing to do with}} her father. It has the sound of an early 1990s dance hit, and the song has been compared to the music by Seal and Adamski. The track is about her struggle while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> music industry and how people can get fanatical about money, drugs, fame or religion. [...] "Daddy" [...] also represents how that one thing you can keep returning to, like how drug addiction in the music industry and how easy it is to turn to. However, at the same time as she wrote the song she was thinking about The Jeremy Kyle Show, and the fact that people laugh at the people on that show, and that they are desperate enough to go on the show and talk about their problems. She also said that the song was written very quickly in two or three hours.|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{began by}} writing tracks for {{artists such as}} Alesha Dixon, Chipmunk, Professor Green, Devlin, Preeya Kalidas, Cheryl Cole, and Tinie Tempah. While <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> music {{industry}} she was studying Medicine at the University of Glasgow, but she decided to stop in her fourth year. Sandé always said that her education {{was the most important}} thing to her, stating if her music career was to fail, she would have her education to fall back on. Sandé said that her manager, Adrian Sykes, waited patiently since she was 16, saying [...] "Adrian really respects that I want to get an education behind me. He also knows my parents are keen that I finish university." [...] Sandé first performed publicly when she provided guest vocals on Chipmunk's hit single, [...] "Diamond Rings" [...] which she also wrote in 2009. A year later she returned again to the public's attention when she teamed up with Wiley on his comeback single, [...] "Never Be Your Woman", the song became Sandé second top-ten single on the UK Singles Chart. It was later announced that [...] "Never Be Your Woman" [...] was a trail for Sandé with EMI Records to see how well the song charted, with the success the song had, Sandé later signed a record deal with Virgin Records.|$|E
2500|$|Illustrator Benjamin Roman {{made his}} {{professional}} debut {{with the first}} volume of I Luv Halloween; he wanted to create [...] "something that was offbeat and a little gory, but with a kind of humor and playfulness." [...] Having spent years <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> comic book industry, he moved to Los Angeles, California, in 2003, and worked at Kinko's in Hollywood; there, he met a Tokyopop employee, who passed along some of his [...] "rejected proposals" [...] to now-former editor Mark Paniccia. Keith Giffen, an American comic book illustrator and writer who had previously adapted the Tokyopop-licensed manga Battle Royale and Battle Vixens for an English-language audience, joined the project as the writer. Together, they spent three to four years working on the series. Although Roman did not draw the series with any particular influences in mind, he read Calvin and Hobbes and Marvel books as a child. Drawing inspiration from science-fiction and horror films in general, Roman acknowledged that [...] "some of that same kitsch finds itself in I Luv Halloween." [...] For the plot, Roman and Giffen were given [...] "a lot of leeway creatively," [...] and Roman commented: [...] "I think that we were seeing how irresponsible we could go with that story and still get away with it. We were just trying to let loose with the characters, however violent that mentality my have turned at some points." [...] As a way to celebrate the conclusion of the series, Roman gave away more than one hundred pages of I Luv Halloween artwork and five hundred replicas of Finch's mask at the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con International.|$|E
