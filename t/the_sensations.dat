5|$|After {{the success}} of his {{previous}} film The Life of Oharu, Mizoguchi was offered to make a film by his old friend Masaichi Nagata at Daiei Film studios. The deal promised Mizoguchi complete artistic control and a large budget. Despite this, Mizoguchi was eventually pressured to make a less pessimistic ending for the film. Mizoguchi's sceenwriter and long-time collaborator Yoshikata Yoda said that originally, Mizoguchi did not envision making an anti-war film, instead wishing to capture <b>the</b> <b>sensations</b> and lucidity of Ueda's book Ugetsu Monogatari.|$|E
5|$|O'Connell's strict classics-oriented {{education}} in Ireland stood him in good stead for his early career choices of teacher and journalist. In San Francisco, he formed friendships with artists and influential men who joined {{with him in}} presenting and promoting theatrical productions and in publishing books and newspapers. He wrote short stories for magazines and journals, and lived a life rich in food, drink, and the arts. A dedicated family man in America, O'Connell never lost his Irish poet's sense of overarching sadness joined with keen pleasure in <b>the</b> <b>sensations</b> of the physical world.|$|E

5|$|Tests {{exist to}} measure how much {{sensation}} a person has retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize <b>the</b> <b>sensations</b> associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people {{who are able to}} achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap can be added to a vibrator or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function.|$|E
5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's philosophy of <b>the</b> <b>sensations,</b> which {{argued that the}} senses were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} the poem is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of the poem is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited in our ability to understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E
5|$|M. nigrocincta ants have highly venomous stings {{which are}} painful and produce intense burning sensations. <b>The</b> <b>sensations</b> last for many {{days and the}} sting itches. If left untreated, the sting may develop into an ulcer. The venom of a closely related species, M. pilosula is amongst the strongest of the Formicidae and {{contains}} active ingredients such as acid and alkaline phosphatases, hyaluronidase, as well as phospholipases A2 and B. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study, the objective of which was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, it was shown that 265 of the 376 participants taking {{part of the study}} reacted to the sting of several Myrmecia species. Of these, 176 reacted to the M. pilosula, 15 to M. nigrocincta, three to M. ludlowi, and 56 to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis. Besides Myrmecia species, these included the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica).|$|E
5000|$|The {{categories}} of quality all have degrees of reality as their schema. Quality {{is related to}} the content of real being in time. Kant metaphorically explained the schema of quality as the filling up of time with a sensation. Monck paraphrased Kant as saying, [...] "We may speak of time as being more completely filled when <b>the</b> <b>sensation</b> is more vivid, and less completely filled when <b>the</b> <b>sensation</b> is weaker. If <b>the</b> <b>sensation</b> is sufficiently vivid the present moment is so filled with it that it seems impossible to attend to, or even be conscious of any other sensation simultaneously; but when it becomes weaker we have leisure to perceive other sensations also. This occurs by degrees. [...] "We can represent this filling as taking place by a gradual increase from zero (empty time) to any given degree of vividness, or by a similar descent from <b>the</b> <b>sensation</b> of <b>the</b> moment to zero." [...] Reality is <b>the</b> experience of <b>sensation</b> in time. Negation is <b>the</b> absence of <b>sensation</b> in time. Limitation is the range of degrees, between the transition from full to empty, by which things are sensed in time. But Monck stated that [...] "Again Kant does not here give in detail the Schemata of the Categories of Reality, Negation, and Limitation." [...] He qualifiedly suggested that [...] "In the first case Reality, we should, perhaps, represent <b>the</b> <b>sensation</b> as occupying <b>the</b> present moment to the exclusion of everything else; in the second Negation <b>the</b> <b>sensation</b> as entirely absent from the present moment; in the third Limitation <b>the</b> <b>sensation</b> as occupying <b>the</b> present moment along with others.|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo realize indoor thermal environments without {{discomfort}} due to dryness in the airway, {{the relationship}} among <b>the</b> <b>sensation,</b> <b>the</b> hygrothermal state in the airway and environmental conditions should be quantitatively studied. Subject experiments revealed that under conditions with high temperature or low humidity, the exhaled air temperature was higher, and <b>the</b> <b>sensation</b> of dryness was stronger. In addition, {{the results of the}} respiration model that calculated the hygrothermal state in the airway showed agreement with the experimental results. Moreover, the calculated moisture evaporation rate in the airway correlated with <b>the</b> <b>sensation</b> of dryness, which suggested the possibility of predicting a dry <b>sensation</b> based on <b>the</b> proposed model...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>sensations</b> {{registered}} by {{the human}} nose derive from the first two (2) branches of cranial nerve V, the trigeminal nerve (nervus trigeminis).

5000|$|The gothic {{influence}} on <b>the</b> <b>sensation</b> novel {{is described by}} Laurence Talairach-Vielmas thus:secrecy and the body go hand in hand, and <b>the</b> more <b>sensation</b> novels highlight <b>the</b> elusiveness or artificiality of human identity, the more hair-raising Gothic loci appear as the ultimate place where fragment of truth can be recollected and reunited and story rewritten.A common gothic influence seen in <b>the</b> <b>sensation</b> novels is <b>the</b> search for a secret. Moreover, crime scenes at wells or near water are symbolic of the [...] "depth" [...] which {{is a key element}} of gothic fiction. <b>The</b> <b>sensation</b> novel puts a modern spin on the classic gothic ghost stories by placing the stories in contemporary settings and this produces the effect of creating a terror that is real and believable. Le Fanu's story, [...] "Green Tea", is exemplary of <b>the</b> <b>sensation</b> novelists desire to explore the path less trodden. The main character, Jennings, inadvertently opens up an inner eye that can see the spiritual world after consuming too much green tea.|$|R

5|$|Common {{problems}} {{women experience}} post-SCI are pain with intercourse and difficulty achieving orgasm. Around half {{of women with}} SCI are able to reach orgasm, usually when their genitals are stimulated.

25|$|There is {{some debate}} whether {{certain types of}} sexual sensations should be {{accurately}} classified as orgasms, including female orgasms caused by G-spot stimulation alone, and the demonstration of extended or continuous orgasms lasting several minutes or even an hour. The question centers around the clinical definition of orgasm, but this way of viewing orgasm is merely physiological, while there are also psychological, endocrinological, and neurological definitions of orgasm. In these and similar cases, <b>the</b> <b>sensations</b> experienced are subjective {{and do not necessarily}} involve the involuntary contractions characteristic of orgasm. However, <b>the</b> <b>sensations</b> in both sexes are extremely pleasurable and are often felt throughout the body, causing a mental state that is often described as transcendental, and with vasocongestion and associated pleasure comparable to that of a full-contractionary orgasm. For example, modern findings support distinction between ejaculation and male orgasm. For this reason, there are views on both sides as to whether these can be accurately defined as orgasms.|$|E
25|$|The Monitors {{inception}} was, in part, {{a response}} by Eddy to the journalism of her day, which relentlessly covered <b>the</b> <b>sensations</b> and scandals surrounding her new religion {{with varying degrees}} of accuracy. In addition, Joseph Pulitzer's New York World was consistently critical of Eddy, and this, along with a derogatory article in McClure's, furthered Eddy's decision to found her own media outlet.|$|E
25|$|Sensation is used {{to portray}} a character's perceptions.

25|$|One common {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} possibility exists that one might misremember <b>the</b> <b>sensation,</b> and therefore {{one does not have}} any firm criterion for using S in each case. So, for example, I might one day focus on that sensation, and link it to the symbol S; but the next day, I have no criteria for knowing that <b>the</b> <b>sensation</b> I have now {{is the same as the}} one yesterday, except for my memory; and since my memory might fail me, I have no firm criteria for knowing that <b>the</b> <b>sensation</b> I have now is indeed S.|$|R

The results indicated that the stomach and esophagus were more sensitive to temperature and pressure than had been realized.
