5|$|On the left, {{the attacks}} by the 161st Brigade were {{similarly}} weakened by loss of direction when the 1/5th Battalion, The Essex Regiment attacked Rafa Redoubt instead of Zowaiid trench. However, the 1/6th Battalion, The Essex Regiment attacked and captured Beach and Sea Posts before attacking the Rafa Redoubt and trench systems, suffering light casualties. In support, a tank rolled out wire as it drove {{along the front}} line from Sea Post to Beach Post. Cricket Redoubt was captured {{with the help of}} the tank from Beach Post; although the <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> temporarily disabled in the process. After being repaired, the <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> transporting some engineers' stores to Sheikh Hasan when it was hit and disabled again. Two reserve tanks were ordered forward carrying engineers' storesincluding sandbags which were set on fire by hostile fire.|$|E

5|$|Think Tank, {{released}} in May 2003, {{was filled with}} atmospheric, brooding electronic sounds, featuring simpler guitar lines played by Albarn, and largely relying on other instruments to replace Coxon. The guitarist's absence also meant that Think <b>Tank</b> <b>was</b> almost entirely written by Albarn. Its sound {{was seen as a}} testament to Albarn's increasing interest in African and Middle Eastern music, and to his complete control over the group's creative direction. Think <b>Tank</b> <b>was</b> yet another UK number one and managed Blur's highest US position of number 56. It was also nominated for best album at the 2004 Brit Awards. The band did a successful tour in 2003, with former Verve guitarist Simon Tong filling in for Coxon.|$|E
5|$|About 20 minutes later, Bariko {{launched}} a helicopter {{to check on}} the cable winch which was to collect samples. It also lowered boats to test radioactivity levels in the lagoon. B-17 pilotless drone aircraft were flown through the clouds, and a drone light <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> used to recover soil samples from the crater. Unfortunately, it became bogged and had to be towed out ten days later.|$|E
5|$|As the company's only engineer, Bristow rapidly {{developed}} a prototype himself before turning the game over to new hire Lyle Rains {{to develop into}} a finished product, codenamed K2 Tank. Rains added the maze and central minefield to the game design and developed the final hardware, including the simple control scheme. Peter Takaichi designed a large custom cabinet to house it. <b>Tank</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the first}} games to use integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, mask ROM (read-only memory)—to store graphical data, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used; it is sometimes claimed in sources to be the very first, but was preceded at minimum by Atari's Gran Trak 10 (1974). Integrated circuit-based memory thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. Before the game could be completed, in September 1974 Atari announced plans to merge itself and Kee Games back together; <b>Tank</b> <b>was</b> released that November just prior to the merger in December 1974.|$|E
50|$|Development of a tank {{classification}} system started in World War I, when <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> separated into light tanks and tankettes, medium tanks, and heavy tanks, based on size and weight. Heavy <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> {{required to be}} large to cross trenches, and consequently weighed a lot. Medium <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> smaller and had help to cross trenches so weighed less. Light <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> much smaller and lightweight, allowing transport on lorries (trucks).|$|R
50|$|Another {{refinery}} employee {{commented that}} these large oil storage <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> sometimes purposely floated {{in order to}} move them. The containment levees around the <b>tank</b> <b>are</b> generally filled with water and <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> moved in this way around <b>tank</b> farms. This <b>is</b> done on a planned basis with all oil removed from the tank being moved.|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} {{underwater}} scene, {{most of which}} was shot at the water tank at Universal, Lawless had to be seat-belted into a car {{that was supposed to}} be submerged thirteen feet. In actuality, the water <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> four feet deep. Lawless, being six feet tall, had to kneel and breathe into a hookah while filming the scene. For the special effects team, one of the hardest parts of the episode was to hide the fact that Lawless was wearing a swimming suit.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the museum}} building, an ex-Iraqi Army T-55 <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> put {{on display at}} the main {{entrance}} in August 2008. This vehicle was captured by the Royal Engineers during the opening stages of the Iraq War in 2003. The spot had previously been occupied by an Iraqi ZSU-23-4 Shilka anti-aircraft gun. Captured by the Royal Artillery after the 1991 Gulf War, it was moved from Imperial War Museum Duxford and displayed to mark the museum's fifth anniversary in July 2007.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Water <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> liquid storage {{containers}}. These containers {{are used}} for storing water. Water <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> traditionally designed by working stress method. As per revised IS 3370 water <b>tank</b> can also <b>be</b> designed by limit state method. In this dissertation water <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> designed by both working stress method and limit state method. Circular and square water <b>tank</b> <b>are</b> considered. Detailed analysis and design is done. Working drawings are prepared for all conditions. For understanding the financial implications quantities for concrete and steel were calculated. Exact amount of steel required is calculated for each case as per working drawings. It was observed that in case of limit state design cost required is less. Obviously circular water <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> more economical compare to square tank. Index Terms-Water tanks, working stress, limit state. Water <b>tank</b> <b>are</b> liquid storage containers. These containers are usually storing water for human consumption. The need for water <b>tank</b> systems <b>is</b> as old as civilized man. A ground water tank provide...|$|R
5|$|T-26 mod. 1933 in the Museum of the Northwestern Front in Staraya Russa, Novgorod Oblast (Russia): this <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> {{raised from}} the Lovat River in 1981 {{and became a}} {{monument}} to Soviet tankers in Korovitchino village (Novgorod Oblast).

5|$|The 722 Sunshields were {{carefully}} pre-positioned in the Martello tank-holding area near El Imayid railway station. Each was numbered. The crew of each <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> brought to Martello, told their number, shown {{where they would}} be parked and taught how to put up and take down the Sunshield, which they would have to do at night.|$|E
5|$|The AM-1Q was {{developed}} for electronic countermeasures (ECM) duties. The fuselage fuel <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> removed {{to make room for}} the ECM operator and his equipment in a windowless compartment. The aircraft carried several radio and radar receivers, transmitters and a signal analyzer. The operator could also drop bundles of chaff through a chute to block radar signals.|$|E
50|$|The T-72M4 CZ is an {{upgraded}} Czech {{version of}} the Soviet-made main battle tank T-72. The only user of this <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> the Czech Army. Between 2003 and 2006, 30 <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> produced. The main armament is a 125 mm gun 2A46M. The crew comprises a gunner, driver and commander. Maximum speed on the road is 61 km/h, and in terrain 44 km/h. This <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> comparable with third generation MBT. All <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> still in active service.|$|R
50|$|The {{outer shell}} of the water <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> a {{cylindrical}} stainless-steel tank 39 m in diameter and 42 m in height. The <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> self-supporting, with concrete backfilled against the rough-hewn stone walls to counteract water pressure when the <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> filled. The capacity of the tank exceeds 50 ktons of water.|$|R
50|$|Petrol is {{supplied}} by gravity from the tank {{at the rear}} of the car but once the car is under way exhaust gases maintain a pressure within this tank. A lubricating oil <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> pressurised the same way. The petrol <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> in two compartments separated by a partial partition. Both sections are filled when the <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> filled above that partition but when the larger <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> empty the second tank provides a fresh supply and a timely warning to the driver.|$|R
5|$|The T-26 was a Soviet {{development}} of the British Vickers 6-Ton (Vickers Mk.E) (the Polish 7TP <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> another {{development of}} Vickers E 6-Ton) tank, which was designed by the Vickers-Armstrongs company in 1928–29. The simple and easy-to-maintain Vickers 6-Ton was intended for export to less technically advanced countries: the Soviet Union, Poland, Brazil, Argentina, Japan, Thailand, China, and many others. Vickers advertised the tank in military publications, and both the Soviet Union and Poland expressed interest in the Vickers design.|$|E
5|$|The T-26 was {{exported}} {{and used}} extensively by Spain, China and Turkey. Captured T-26s {{were used by}} the Finnish, German, Romanian and Hungarian armies. The <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> reliable and simple to maintain, and its design was continually modernised between 1931 and 1941. No new models of the T-26 were developed after 1940.|$|E
5|$|Calculations {{show that}} the tank would have begun to {{overflow}} at about 05:20. There is evidence suggesting that a high-level switch, which should have detected that the <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> full and shut off the supply, failed to operate. The switch failure should have triggered an alarm, but it too appears to have failed. Forty-one minutes later, an estimated 300tonnes of petrol would have spilled {{down the side of}} the tank through the roof vents onto the ground inside a bund walla semi-enclosed compound surrounding several tanks.|$|E
50|$|Vehicles {{are often}} fitted {{with only one}} tank, but {{multiple}} <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> used in a some applications. In passenger car applications, the <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> typically either a cylindrical tank, made from steel, mounted in the boot of the vehicle or a toroidal tank (also steel) or set of permanently interconnected cylinders placed in the spare wheel well. In commercial vehicle applications, the <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> generally cylindrical <b>tanks</b> mounted either in the cargo space or on the chassis underneath the body. Increasingly, the <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> an aluminium Conformable <b>Tank,</b> which <b>is</b> lighter, has more capacity and cannot rust.|$|R
50|$|At {{least three}} <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> {{deployed}} from Chernihiv on 22 January 2014. Officially the <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> being {{transferred to the}} Odessa Oblast and not be going to Kiev. On January 23, 2014 {{it was announced that}} due to the complicated situation in the country all <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> returned to their place of permanent base.|$|R

5|$|December 44 Museum, La Gleize, Belgium. A cosmetically {{restored}} Tiger II (production turret) Hull number 280273, {{built in}} October 1944. Turret number 213 from s.SS Pz.Abt 501. Displayed {{at the entrance}} to DECEMBER 44 MUSEUM Collections, a museum devoted entirely to the Battle of the Bulge. This <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> abandoned in La Gleize on 24 December 1944, where the advance of Kampfgruppe Peiper was halted. The front part, about 1/3, of the gun barrel is restored with a Panther gun barrel and muzzle brake. It also has restored mudguards. It is stripped of exterior and internal fittings and most of the torsion bars are broken, but it still has its gearbox and engine in place.|$|E
5|$|Firefighting {{operations}} were resumed at about 20:00, {{and it was}} anticipated that all fires could be extinguished during the night. Further damage occurred {{to one of the}} storage tanks {{in the early hours of}} Tuesday morning, causing firefighters to be withdrawn once again, but operations resumed at 08:30. By midday on 13 December, all but three fires had been extinguished, although the largest <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> still burning. Bronze commandoperations on the groundwas visited by the Bishop of St Albans, the local vicar, and the industrial chaplain supporting the fire crews, to see how they were coping.|$|E
5|$|Further {{armament}} was {{to consist}} of a 128mm anti-tank gun of the type used in the Jagdtiger or Maus, two 15mm Mauser MG 151/15 autocannons, and eight 20mm Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns, probably with at least four {{of them as a}} Flakvierling quad mount. The 128mm anti-tank gun's precise location on the Ratte is a point of contention among historians, most believing {{that it would have been}} mounted within the primary turret, with some others thinking a smaller secondary turret at the rear of the Ratte more logical. Some concept drawings exist to suggest a flexible mount on the glacis plate. The <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> to be provided with a vehicle bay that could hold two BMW R12 motorcycles for scouting, and several smaller storage rooms, a compact infirmary area, and a self-contained lavatory system.|$|E
40|$|One key {{to clean}} {{freshwater}} {{is to prevent}} hazardous liquid spills from {{taking place in the}} first place. An important element to spill prevention is the safe storage of hazardous liquids in tanks that comply with national standards. Tanks come in many shapes and forms. Large <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> erected in the field. Smaller <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> produced in a factory and shipped to the site for installation. Shop-built <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> made for underground installations and for aboveground installations. Aboveground <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> either oriented for horizontal or vertical installation, and are produced in either cylindrical form or rectangular form. The <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> capable of being designed and fabricated as pressure vessels, but are more typically vented to atmosphere. The tank can have compartments internal to the <b>tank.</b> <b>Tanks</b> <b>are</b> often secondarily contained. The <b>tank</b> can <b>be</b> insulated for fire safety or temperature control. Corrosion protection can be given to exterior tank bottoms in contact with soil or to the tank interior with special coatings and linings.

5000|$|Required {{daily and}} weekly stored energy: The {{cost of the}} storage <b>tanks</b> <b>is</b> a {{significant}} factor in the total cost of a pumpable ice system.
