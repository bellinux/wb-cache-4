25|$|Mueller {{increasingly}} {{believed that}} {{to move up}} {{in the hierarchy of}} the Labs he would need a PhD, and he began working towards this goal on a part-time basis at Princeton University, getting up every morning at around 5 o'clock and driving to Princeton <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of courses before driving back down to Holmdel to work all day at Bell Labs. In 1946 a colleague at the Labs, Milton Boone, a professor from Ohio State University on leave at Bell Labs during the war, encouraged Mueller to help set up a vacuum tube lab and run the communications group at Ohio State.|$|E
25|$|One of nine {{changes to}} the {{starting}} eleven, Redmond produced an outstanding performance as Birmingham outclassed Maribor in the last group stage fixture. Apart from Jovan Vidović's early header that went wide, the attacking play was all Birmingham's. After 24 minutes, Rooney scored his first European goal, a close-range header from a Redmond cross, then Žigić failed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of chances, Davies failed {{to make contact with}} a Redmond corner when {{it would have been easier}} to score, and Redmond himself hit a half-volley against the post from distance. His marker, Arghus, was perhaps fortunate to escape a red card for a high tackle born of frustration. But ten-man Braga could only draw with Brugge, so Birmingham's ten points were not enough.|$|E
500|$|In 1854, Maxwell {{graduated}} from Trinity {{with a degree}} in mathematics. He scored second highest in the final examination, coming behind Edward Routh and earning himself the title of Second Wrangler. He was later declared equal with Routh in the more exacting ordeal of the Smith's Prize examination. Immediately after earning his degree, Maxwell read his paper [...] "On the Transformation of Surfaces by Bending" [...] to the Cambridge Philosophical Society. This {{is one of the few}} purely mathematical papers he had written, demonstrating Maxwell's growing stature as a mathematician. Maxwell decided to remain at Trinity after graduating and applied for a fellowship, which was a process that he could expect <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of years. Buoyed by his success as a research student, he would be free, apart from some tutoring and examining duties, to pursue scientific interests at his own leisure.|$|E

500|$|After {{his brief}} stay in Pittsburgh, the Pirates sent Clarke to Greenville in 1920. He played next for Toledo and Winston-Salem, {{and then for}} the Reading Aces in the International League during the 1922 and 1923 seasons. In 1924, he played for both Reading and Harrisburg. [...] In 1925, he played for the Salisbury Indians in the Eastern Shore League. In the spring of 1925, The Sporting News wrote: [...] "Nig Clarke not only led the league with the bat and the mitt and the arm, he was the very picture of a {{baseball}} player. I rather suspect that Nig put away as much corn juice as the next man. In the days of his greatness he was wont <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of snifters every morning before breakfast. Never seemed to hurt Nig any." [...] At {{the end of the}} season, he was given most valuable player honors for his performance with Salisbury. Clarke concluded his professional baseball career in 1927 with Tulsa.|$|E
500|$|On March 13, 2006, Hayes {{announced}} that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices." [...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement. Later in an interview on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, [...] "Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not like that. I know that's your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing.

I know that’s your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know?" [...] He then told them <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of Scientology courses to understand what they do.

[...] He also stated: [...] "They wanted to do a retro movie. I don't like that. Every movie, I worked very hard to make them different… I made them completely different—different planets, different spaceships to make it new." [...] In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told The Hollywood Reporter that Lucas had seen the movie and [...] "liked it". In the same month, at the Kennedy Center Honors, Lucas said: “I think the fans are going to love it, It’s very much the kind of movie they’ve been looking for." [...] Abrams felt that, as the first in a new trilogy, the film had [...] "needed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of steps backwards into very familiar terrain" [...] and use plot elements from previous Star Wars films.|$|E

Shortly after this a diversion occurred, for the clergyman, Mr. Jeffries, a pleasant little man, with a round and shining face and a most unclerical eyeglass, came up to consult the Squire upon some matter of parish business, and was shown into the dining-room. Ida took advantage of his appearance to effect a retreat to her own room, and there for the present we may leave her to her meditations.|$|E

60|$|After a {{great deal}} of {{deliberation}} it had been decided that James Morris should start for the west about the first of May. Dave and Henry were to go with him, and likewise Sam Barringford and three other frontiersmen named Lukins, Sanderson, and Jadwin. The party was likewise to contain four Indians of the Delaware tribe under White Buffalo. The whites were all to go mounted and were to take six pack-horses in addition. At first James Morris thought <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of wagons, {{at least as far as}} Fort Pitt, but this plan was at the last moment abandoned, for wagons were scarce and high in price, and there was no telling if they could be sold when the last fort on the frontier was gained, and further progress with anything on wheels became out of the question.|$|E
50|$|These birds {{breed in}} colonies, their eggs being laid {{directly}} amongst tree roots or in rock crevices.

50|$|Though unquestionably a Swedish victory {{the battle}} had little {{influence}} {{on the outcome of}} the war.

60|$|They made a {{long journey}} that night, slept within seven or eight miles of Helpmakaar, and started late in the afternoon. When near the town they left the main road, passed through some fields, and came into the place that way, as had they entered by the road they {{were likely to be}} questioned. Once in the little town, they walked about at their ease. It did not seem that there were any great number of Boers there, but the town was well within the {{district}} held by them, and such loyalists as remained were sure to be keeping as much as possible without their houses. In front of the principal inn were nearly a score of Boer ponies, but the lads considered it would be altogether too risky to attempt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of these, as their owners might issue out while they were doing it; however, they stood watching. For some time there was a sound of singing and merriment within, and for {{a quarter of an hour}} no one came out.|$|E
60|$|The Fives Court was {{opposite}} our window; {{and here}} I used, very unwillingly at first, but afterwards, I do confess, with much eagerness, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of hours' daily sport. Ah! {{it was a}} strange place. There was an aristocracy there as elsewhere,--amongst other gents, a son of my Lord Deuce-ace; and many {{of the men in the}} prison were as eager to walk with him, and talked of his family as knowingly, as if they were Bond Street bucks. Poor Tidd, especially, was one of these. Of all his fortune he had nothing left but a dressing-case and a flowered dressing- gown; and to these possessions he added a fine pair of moustaches, with which the poor creature strutted about; and though cursing his ill fortune, was, I do believe, as happy whenever his friends brought him a guinea, as he had been during his brief career as a gentleman on town. I have seen sauntering dandies in watering-places ogling the women, watching eagerly for steamboats and stage-coaches as if their lives depended upon them, and strutting all day in jackets up and down the public walks. Well, there are such fellows in prison: quite as dandified and foolish, only a little more shabby--dandies with dirty beards and holes at their elbows.|$|E
60|$|Major Hackett was now ordered <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of {{companies}} of the 90th, and to advance up the slope, round {{the rear of}} the cattle-laager. Taking post here, they opened a deliberate and deadly fire upon the enemy, and then advancing drove back the Zulus with great loss. The Zulu general, however, led a party of his best marksmen round to his right, and opened a heavy fire upon the 90th, as they fell back upon their intrenchments. Lieutenant Bright fell mortally wounded, and in running forward to pick him up Major Hackett was struck by a ball sideways, which passed through both eyes and destroyed his sight for ever. Meanwhile, from the works on the heights, Captain Nicholson was doing great execution with his two 7-pounders. The Zulu main body had now come within range, and grape and canister were poured into their heavy masses. As Nicholson was standing on the parapet, field-glass in hand, directing the pointing of two guns, a bullet struck him on the temple and he fell dead. He was seen from the laager to fall, and Major Vaughan was sent to take his place. Major Tremlett, R.A., now took the four guns, hitherto held in reserve, to a small piece of rising ground outside the laager, and opened fire upon the masses of the enemy with immense execution. From time to time Buller and Russell, as they saw openings for a charge, swept down and drove the enemy's skirmishers back on to their main body; the Zulus, altogether unaccustomed to cavalry, always falling back precipitately at these assaults.|$|E
50|$|In May 1997, Alice was {{approached}} by a mystery woman, who introduced herself as Nick's girlfriend, Karen. Karen kept coming to see Alice and told Kathy that when Nick was released, they and Alice would be moving to Boston. Kathy was annoyed at Karen for getting Alice's hopes up about Nick being released, knowing {{there was very little}} chance he would get off. Kathy went to see Nick who confirmed that what Karen was saying was true and that even if he went to prison, he wanted Karen <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Alice. <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> of weeks later, Nick was sentenced to 10 years in prison and Karen left for Boston alone. Kathy, meanwhile, was left to tell Alice, then aged just six, that her dad was not coming home and it would just be the two of them from now on. Kathy, who had grown very close to Alice, was relieved that she could keep Alice, but was upset at the thought of her brother spending so long in prison.|$|R
50|$|While Williams {{was able}} <b>to</b> compete and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of {{victories}} home in recent years, the FW27 proved {{not to be}} up to the same performance levels as some of the other teams' cars. New drivers Mark Webber and Nick Heidfeld scored points quite frequently, but a Grand Prix win was not within their reach. The highlight was the second and third places in Monaco. Heidfeld also scored a second place at the European race, where he started from pole. From the Italian Grand Prix onwards, Heidfeld, who was injured, was replaced by Antônio Pizzonia, who had previously been Webber's team-mate at Jaguar in 2003. The team ended the season in fifth place in the Constructors' Championship, failing to meet their own high expectations.|$|R

Soon, Sam, the man of the house, starts to sexually assault her and, having discovered her skills, which were learned from her experiences with Wale her father, begins to play pimp.

60|$|As time rolled on, in {{the first}} place, {{the number of the}} colony had begun to augment by natural means. Friend Martha had {{presented}} Friend Robert with a little Robert; and Bridget made Mark the happy parent of a very charming girl. This last event occurred about the commencement of the summer, and just a twelvemonth after the happy reunion of the young couple. According to Mark's prophecy, Jones had succeeded with Joan, and they were married even before the expiration of the six months mentioned. On the subject of a marriage ceremony there was no difficulty, Robert and Martha holding a Friends' meeting especially to quiet the scruples of the bride, though she was assured the form could do no good, since the bridegroom did not belong to meeting. The governor read the church service on the occasion, too, which did no harm, if it did no good. About this time, poor Peters, envying the happiness of all around him, and still pining for his Petrina, or Peggy, as he called her himself, begged of the governor the use of the Dido, in order that he might make a voyage to Wally's group in quest of his lost companion. Mark knew how to feel for one in the poor fellow's situation, and he could not think of letting him go alone on an expedition of so much peril. After deliberating on the matter, he determined to visit Rancocus Island himself--not having been in that direction, now, for months--and to go in the Neshamony, in order <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of hogs over; it having long been decided to commence breeding that valuable animal, in the wild state, on the hills of that uninhabited land.|$|E
60|$|Leaving Umslopogaas to {{hold the}} horses, I hobbled to the spring and drank deep of its sweet waters. I had had nothing but a single mouthful of wine since midday, when the battle began, and I was parched up, though my fatigue was too great {{to allow me to}} feel hungry. Then, having laved my fevered head and hands, I returned, and the Zulu went and drank. Next we allowed the horses <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of mouthfuls each -- no more; and oh, what a {{struggle}} we had to get the poor beasts away from the water! There were yet two minutes, and I employed it in hobbling up and down to try and relieve my stiffness, and in inspecting the condition of the horses. My mare, gallant animal though she was, was evidently much distressed; she hung her head, and her eye looked sick and dull; but Daylight, Nyleptha's glorious horse -- who, if he is served aright, should, like the steeds who saved great Rameses in his need, feed {{for the rest of his}} days out of a golden manger -- was still comparatively speaking fresh, notwithstanding the fact that he had had by far the heavier weight to carry. He was 'tucked up', indeed, and his legs were weary, but his eye was bright and clear, and he held his shapely head up and gazed out into the darkness round him in a way that seemed to say that whoever failed he was good for those five-and-forty miles that yet lay between us and Milosis. Then Umslopogaas helped me into the saddle and -- vigorous old savage that he was! -- vaulted into his own without touching a stirrup, and we were off once more, slowly at first, till the horses got into their stride, and then more swiftly. So we passed over another ten miles, and then came a long, weary rise of some six or seven miles, and three times did my poor black mare nearly come to the ground with me. But on the top she seemed to gather herself together, and rattled down the slope with long, convulsive strides, breathing in gasps. We did that three or four miles more swiftly than any since we had started on our wild ride, but I felt it to be a last effort, and I was right. Suddenly my poor horse took the bit between her teeth and bolted furiously along a stretch of level ground for some three or four hundred yards, and then, with two or three jerky strides, pulled herself up and fell with a crash right on to her head, I rolling myself free as she did so. As I struggled to my feet the brave beast raised her head and looked at me with piteous bloodshot eyes, and then her head dropped with a groan and she was dead. Her heart was broken.|$|E
