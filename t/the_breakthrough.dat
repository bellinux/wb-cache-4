30|$|For <b>the</b> {{incomplete}} steam <b>breakthrough</b> well, <b>the</b> mature <b>breakthrough</b> channel has {{not been}} formed. So for some calculating methods of blocking agent volume, this kind of well is not taken into consideration. Such design may not be appropriate because the motion and distribution of the blocking agent among complete breakthrough channels and incomplete breakthrough channels is a dynamic balance process. This phenomenon is especially obvious in the injection process of particle blocking agent (Alvarez et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2012 b). So if the blocking volume between the injector and <b>the</b> incomplete steam <b>breakthrough</b> producer is ignored, the designed blocking agent will partly flow to <b>the</b> incomplete <b>breakthrough</b> well. As a result, the designed blocking volume may not be sufficient enough to block <b>the</b> main <b>breakthrough</b> channel and <b>the</b> whole blockage effect will be weakened. In this article, the channel between the injector and incomplete producer is considered.|$|R

5|$|Gangsta rap {{is a kind}} of hip hop, most {{importantly}} characterized by a lyrical focus on macho sexuality, physicality and a dangerous, criminal image.

This West Coast rap scene spawned the early 1990s G-funk sound, which paired gangsta rap lyrics with a thick and hazy tone, often relying on samples from 1970s P-funk; the best-known proponents of this sound were <b>the</b> <b>breakthrough</b> rappers Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eastern}} battles {{during the first}} two weeks of September, the South Korean troops, {{demoralized}} though they were, did most of the ground fighting. American tanks, artillery, and ground units supported them. Uncontested UN aerial supremacy and naval gunfire from offshore also supported the South Korean troops, and probably were the factors that tipped the scales in their favor. After the initial phase of their September offensive, the North Koreans labored under what proved to be insurmountable difficulties in supplying their forward units. The North Korean system of supply could not resolve the problems of logistics and communication necessary to support and exploit an offensive operation in this sector of the front. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>breakthrough</b> was severe enough that the Eighth Army considered pulling back for several days, eventually deciding to stand its ground.|$|E
