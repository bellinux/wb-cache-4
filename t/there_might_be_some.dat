5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The Bafours were {{primarily}} agricultural, {{and among the}} first Saharan people to abandon their historically nomadic lifestyle. With the gradual desiccation of the Sahara, they headed south. Many of the Berber tribes claimed Yemeni (and sometimes other Arab) origins. There is little evidence to support such claims, but a 2000 DNA study of Yemeni people suggested <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> ancient connection between the peoples.|$|E
25|$|The bog {{in which}} the man was found {{is close to the}} border between Himle and Faurås {{hundreds}}. It is also close to the border between Rolfstorp, Sibbarp, Köinge and Svartrå parishes. The hundreds were responsible for the handling of murders, which meant that in this case <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> confusion over the correct hundred to handle the case, to the advantage of the killer(s). It has therefore been assumed that the killer(s) had good local knowledge.|$|E
25|$|In {{the post}} {{apartheid}} South Africa, {{construction of new}} schools in poorer townships often failed to include the construction of both indoor and outdoor sporting facilities. <b>There</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> space set aside for a netball court or a soccer field, though {{that may be the}} only substitute available. The problems of getting facilities for women's sports like netball is still difficult because of Zulu gender constructions, where men are the dominant cultural force. Some schools in coloured areas do not offer physical education classes. To address this need, they have school teams. Most schools only offer netball for girls, soccer for boys and athletics for both genders. For coloured children, boys rank sport as the most important for things to do in their free time. In contrast, coloured girls rank playing sport as fourth in their list of priorities.|$|E

500|$|Augustus {{was granted}} sole imperium {{within the city}} of Rome itself, in {{addition}} to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular [...] "imperium" [...] when they crossed the Pomerium – the sacred boundary of Rome – and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that, {{when he was in the}} city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or auctoritas, his wishes would usually be obeyed, but <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.|$|E
500|$|The cast was {{receptive}} to the finale storyline. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, actor John Noble noted he liked how the story ultimately ended with having the two Walters [...] "perhaps negotiate a truce and put their minds together" [...] through a [...] "very inventive intervention by Peter, who basically took control of destiny and forced his two fathers to look {{each other in the}} eye, as if telling them: Sort it out, gentlemen.'" [...] He later noted, [...] "We finish [...] in a very dramatic place." [...] Joshua Jackson praised the role-reversal of his character with Walter's, [...] "You had Peter wracked with guilt over the circumstances tied to the decision he made [...] and clinging to hope that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> way out. I can’t have made a cosmically bad decision! There must be some way to put this right! Which is fascinating, because that’s basically been Walter for as long as we’ve known him. So I loved how Peter ceases to be so stubborn when it comes to Walter, comes to understand him and even begins to see things the way he does." ...|$|E

2500|$|In model theory, a {{complete}} theory [...] is called stable {{if it does}} not have too many types. One goal of classification theory is to divide all complete theories into those whose models can be classified and those whose models are too complicated to classify, and to classify all models in the cases where this can be done. Roughly speaking, if a theory is not stable then its models are too complicated and numerous to classify, while if a theory is stable <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> hope of classifying its models, especially if the theory is superstable or totally transcendental.|$|E
2500|$|Modern Western square dance, like {{traditional}} square dance, {{is directed}} by a square dance caller. [...] In modern Western square dance the caller strings together a sequence of individual square dance calls to make a figure or sequence. [...] These calls are {{the building blocks of}} the choreography that is danced by the individuals, square dancers, in the squares. [...] There are eight people (four couples) in each square; at a dance there may be many squares. [...] Generally speaking, each of these squares dances independently of each other, with the exception of specialty or [...] "gimmick" [...] dances, where <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> crossover of dancers from one square to another.|$|E
2500|$|Finnish {{authorities}} {{dismissed the}} possibility that the Arctic Sea was bearing a cargo of nuclear material. Jukka Laaksonen, head of the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority, said radiation tests had been conducted on the ship at a port in Finland before it began its voyage. He also dismissed as [...] "stupid rumours" [...] reports in British and Finnish newspapers that the ship could be carrying a nuclear cargo that could explain its disappearance and the purported hijacking. According to Laaksonen the radioactivity test in Finland took place without any reason: [...] "Some fireman for some reason thought that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> radioactivity involved in this shipment and that was a very stupid idea. There was no basis for that," [...] Laaksonen was quoted by AFP.|$|E

2500|$|The underage {{depiction}} of Kasumi and a feature in Dead or Alive: Dimensions called Figure Modewhich allows players to capture {{images of the}} characters from all angles and store themwere linked to Nintendo's decision to not sell the game in Sweden, allegedly due to the country's strict child pornography laws. Hearing of the Nordic ban and that Dimensions was being sold in Australia with a PG classification, the Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O'Connor and the Australian Classification Board re-examined the game and revoked its classification, although Nintendo Australia assured the board that the game contained no material which could be considered child pornography. Upon re-submission, the game was awarded the stronger (but not age-restricted) M classification and was re-released shortly after. The game's cover art, which featured a high-kicking Kasumi, was slightly altered for the United States release. Reports indicating it was done to appease the ESRB appeared, but a Tecmo Koei spokesperson claimed that [...] "this whole thing is getting blown way out of proportion. The truth {{is that when we}} submitted the box art as-is from Japan, there were a few parties both internal and external who thought <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> issue with the image. Nobody 'demanded' anything be changed, it was just pointed out. You have to pick your battles, and covering up that small bit of the image seemed to be harmless." ...|$|E
2500|$|Leader of the Bloc Québécois Gilles Duceppe {{declared}} that he considered the editorial an attempt at justification. [...] "It even suggests <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> problems in Quebec because of the language laws. It's unacceptable and it's deplorable and it's shameful for a newspaper of that stature", he said. [...] "Try imagining the opposite — If I'd made such nonsensical, absurd remarks (about English Canada). Then all the editorial writers across Canada would get involved." [...] Premier of Quebec Jean Charest {{was said to be}} disappointed by the Globe and Mail response. He was also said to be offended by the little consideration the paper gave his open letter, that was published in the readers' opinion page (like the one from Prime Minister Harper). [...] "The (House of Commons) motion is totally ignored", said the Premier's press attaché. On September 23, 2006, the Canadian Press reported that Edward Greenspon, editor of The Globe and Mail, expressed regrets. In a Globe and Mail column, without making formal apologies, he wrote that the personal opinions of Wong should have been excised from the piece, not because they were unacceptable, but because they constituted a [...] "thesis", not a [...] "statement of fact". He wrote that [...] "they should have been put into a separate piece clearly marked opinion". He however believed the reaction to be clearly disproportionate. Despite Greenspon's insinuation that the piece was not [...] "clearly marked opinion", it had in fact been accompanied by a headshot of Wong, the traditional means of designating opinion pieces.|$|E
