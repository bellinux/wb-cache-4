5|$|Furthermore, despite {{changes to}} the {{campaign}} finance laws, there was no perceptible decrease in campaigning activity. One reason was a compensatory expansion of advertising by way of internet search engines such as Facebook and other social media which were relatively inexpensive. Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts, excluding the Åland Islands, to ask for their assessments of the electoral campaigns. They reported that while the NCP's campaign was the most visible, the Centre Party and the Social Democrats also had high-profile campaigns with some variations across districts. The NCP were also said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>spending</b> more {{of their own money}} than in the past.|$|E

25|$|In addition, in {{the recent}} decade a growing {{minority}} from within the Israeli Jewish conscripts have denounced the mandatory enrollment, and refused to serve (see also Refusal {{to serve in the}} Israeli military), many claiming that due to financial insecurities they feel that they need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>spending</b> their time more productively pursuing their chosen studies or career paths. Some individual resentment may also be compounded by the typically low wages paid to conscripts—the current Israeli policies see National Service as a duty rendered to the country and its citizens, and therefore the Israeli army does not pay any wages to conscripts, but instead grants a low monthly allowance to the full-time national service personnel, {{depending on the type of}} their duty.|$|E

2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{notes in}} her {{assessment}} of the review: [...] "From Camelot to Neverland, the show has never quite been able to sustain itself when it’s simply Storybrooke, as much {{as some of the}} better stories have been rooted there. So it’s not a shock to find out that, after tonight, we’re probably going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>spending</b> some time in the Underworld next month. We already know we’re meeting Hercules and Megara; given tonight’s events, does that also mean we’re meeting Hades? The bigger (and more interesting) question at stake is the fact that now that we’re in the Underworld, how many previously dead characters {{are going to get a}} chance to return? We’ve already had confirmations of past-dead characters like Cruella and Cora, though both of those characters are supposedly strictly for the show’s 100th episode. Regardless, moving to the Underworld opens up a host of options for 5B in terms of characters and plot, and I’m curious to see what those options are." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Emperor Yizong was {{immediately}} met with two military crises. [...] Tang and Nanzhao {{had gotten into}} a diplomatic row over {{the name of the}} Nanzhao king Qiulong (酋龍)—as it violated naming taboo for Emperor Yizong's ancestor Emperor Xuanzong (Li Longji). [...] Emperor Yizong thus refused to issue an edict formally bestowing Qiulong his kingly title. [...] Qiulong responded by changing his state's name to Dali and declaring himself emperor (thus positioning himself as an equal to Emperor Yizong) and by attacking a number of Tang outposts. [...] Meanwhile, the agrarian rebel Qiu Fu (裘甫) and his followers were overrunning Zhedong Circuit (浙東, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang). [...] Qiu's rebellion was suppressed by the imperial general Wang Shi in 860, but the Dali attacks would become more intense, and Dali briefly captured the important city Yong Prefecture (邕州, in modern Nanning, Guangxi) in 861 and then captured Jiao Prefecture (交州, in modern Hanoi, Vietnam) in 862, retaining it. [...] Despite these crises, Emperor Yizong was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>spending</b> much of his time in feast and games, ignoring the affairs of state, despite his officials' urging to attend to them, although he was sending generals to the Dali front (including Kang Chengxun and Gao Pian), without initial success.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, the Mulroney {{government}} announced {{the purchase of}} 35 EH-101 helicopters to replace the CH-124 Sea King. However, {{by the end of}} the 1980s, the CF had another problem at its hands; the fleet of CH-113 Labrador search-and-rescue helicopters needed replacing. In 1991, the Mulroney government tacked on CH-113 Labrador replacement to the purchase, in effect merging the New Shipboard Aircraft Project and the New SAR Helicopter Project. Such a move had economic benefits including the lower unit price per aircraft and for spare parts which accompany larger orders. The training of maintenance personnel and flight crews is simplified. However, such a move also increased the total costs of the program; now up to C$5.8 billion for 50 helicopters (broken down into 35 ASW Sea King replacements and 15 SAR types, dubbed CH-148 Petrel for the former, and CH-149 Chimo for the latter). However, the country at the time was in no position <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>spending</b> billions of dollars, as the government was facing a mounting deficit, and growing unemployment. In 1993, the new leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, Kim Campbell, in an attempt to deflect mounting criticism from the population over the unexpectedly large purchase price announced that the actual order was being reduced to 28 Petrels and 15 Chimos, reducing the purchase price down to C$4.4 billion. However, the political damage was done, and it did not help Tory credibility that when Campbell suggested that an ASW capability could be vital if submarines were used to run the blockade of Haiti, as the very idea that submarines might run this blockade in support of the Haitian junta was absurd. [...] The Liberal leader, Jean Chrétien then the leader of the Opposition, had disparagingly referred to the EH-101 (CH-149 Cormorant) as a [...] "Cadillac" [...] during a time of government restraint and deficit fighting. Terminating the new helicopters was one of the top priorities in the party's election platform for the federal election.|$|E
