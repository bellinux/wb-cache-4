5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Georgian</b> scripts are {{the three}} writing systems used to write <b>the</b> <b>Georgian</b> language: Asomtavruli, Nuskhuri and Mkhedruli. Although the systems differ in appearance, all three are unicase, their letters share the same names and {{alphabetical}} order, and are written horizontally from left to right. Of the three scripts, Mkhedruli was once the civilian royal script of the Kingdom of Georgia mostly used for the royal charters {{and is now the}} standard script for modern Georgian and its related Kartvelian languages, whereas Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri are used only in ceremonial religious texts and iconography by <b>the</b> <b>Georgian</b> Orthodox Church.|$|E

50|$|In June 2004, <b>the</b> new <b>Georgian</b> president, Mikheil Saakashvili, became <b>the</b> first <b>Georgian</b> {{politician}} to have visited <b>the</b> Iranian <b>Georgian</b> community in Fereydunshahr.

5|$|Among the {{remarkable}} events of Tamar's reign was {{the foundation of}} the Empire of Trebizond on the Black Sea coast in 1204. This state was established by Alexios I Megas Komnenos (r. 1204–1222) and his brother, David, in the northeastern Pontic provinces of the crumbling Byzantine Empire with the aid of Georgian troops. Alexios and David, Tamar's relatives, were fugitive Byzantine princes raised at <b>the</b> <b>Georgian</b> court. According to Tamar's historian, the aim of <b>the</b> <b>Georgian</b> expedition to Trebizond was to punish the Byzantine emperor Alexios IV Angelos (r. 1203–1204) for his confiscation of a shipment of money from <b>the</b> <b>Georgian</b> queen to the monasteries of Antioch and Mount Athos. However, Tamar's Pontic endeavor can better be explained by her desire {{to take advantage of the}} Western European Fourth Crusade against Constantinople to set up a friendly state in Georgia's immediate southwestern neighborhood, as well as by the dynastic solidarity to the dispossessed Komnenoi.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1190s, <b>the</b> <b>Georgian</b> {{government}} began {{to interfere in}} the affairs of the Ildenizids and of the Shirvanshahs, aiding rivaling local princes and reducing Shirvan to a tributary state. The Ildenizid atabeg Abu Bakr attempted to stem <b>the</b> <b>Georgian</b> advance, but suffered a defeat at the hands of David Soslan at the Battle of Shamkor and lost his capital to a Georgian protégé in 1195. Although Abu Bakr was able to resume his reign a year later, the Ildenizids were only barely able to contain further Georgian forays.|$|E

5|$|Georgian {{artillery}} units launched smoke bombs into South Ossetia at 23:35 on 7 August. This {{was followed}} by a 15-minute intermission, which purportedly enabled the civilians to escape, before <b>the</b> <b>Georgian</b> forces began bombarding enemy targets. Georgian military intentionally targeted South Ossetian military objects, not civilian ones. Although Georgian military had promised safety to the Russian peacekeepers for their neutrality, the Russian peacekeepers had to follow the Russian command to attack <b>the</b> <b>Georgian</b> troops.|$|E
5|$|Georgian forces {{started moving}} towards Tskhinvali {{following}} {{several hours of}} bombardment and engaged South Ossetian forces and militia near the town at 04:00 on 8 August, with Georgian tanks remotely shelling South Ossetian positions.

By the morning, the South Ossetian authorities had reported that <b>the</b> <b>Georgian</b> shelling had killed at least 15 civilians.|$|E

25|$|Like with <b>the</b> <b>Georgians,</b> once a {{very large}} {{minority}} in Iran {{all the way from}} the Safavid to the Qajar era, the vast majority of the Circassians have been assimilated into the population nowadays.

5|$|In the 10th century AD, Georgia for {{the first}} time emerged as an ethnic concept in the territories where <b>the</b> <b>Georgian</b> {{language}} was used to perform Christian rituals. After the Mongol invasions of the region, the Kingdom of Georgia eventually was broken up into several kingdoms and principalities. In the 19th century, the Russian Empire gradually annexed <b>the</b> <b>Georgian</b> lands. In the aftermath of the Russian revolution, Georgia declared its independence on 26 May 1918.|$|E
5|$|Kumaritashvili grew up {{in nearby}} Bakuriani, which {{is known for its}} many ski slopes. He enjoyed several winter sports and started luge when he was 13 years old. While {{attending}} <b>the</b> <b>Georgian</b> Technical University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics in 2009, Kumaritashvili maintained a rigorous training and competition schedule. Though his family endured economic hardship, Kumaritashvili attended as many luge events as he could, often driving for days to reach World Cup events. As a devout member of <b>the</b> <b>Georgian</b> Orthodox Church, he prayed at church before every competition.|$|E
5|$|Kumaritashvili, {{who first}} began to {{participate}} in luge when he was 13, came {{from a family of}} seasoned lugers: his grandfather had introduced the sport to the Soviet republic of Georgia, and both his father and uncle had competed when they were younger, with his uncle later serving as the head of <b>the</b> <b>Georgian</b> Luge Federation. Kumaritashvili himself began competing in the 2008–09 Luge World Cup. Kumaritashvili had also been a student at <b>the</b> <b>Georgian</b> Technical University, where he earned an economics degree in 2009.|$|E

50|$|The {{passage of}} Russian forces {{through the narrow}} Roki Tunnel and along the {{mountain}} roads was slow and the Russians had difficulties in concentrating their troops, forcing them to bring their forces into battle battalion by battalion. In the afternoon of 9 August, <b>the</b> regrouped <b>Georgian</b> troops tried to regain their control of position in Tskhinvali. <b>The</b> <b>Georgians</b> launched several attacks, including some with tanks. The assault was met with resistance and <b>the</b> <b>Georgians</b> suffered losses, forcing them to withdraw. Because of the gradual increase in troops, the amassed Russian forces in South Ossetia outnumbered <b>the</b> <b>Georgians</b> by nearly two to one on 9 August. In total, the Russians moved between 5,500 and 10,000 troops to South Ossetia through the Roki Tunnel, according to Der Spiegel.|$|R
