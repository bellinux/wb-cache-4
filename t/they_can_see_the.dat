Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa plan {{a trip to}} the Springsonian Museum so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian Treasures of Isis exhibit and the Orb of Isis. Marge has to take Bart to {{a doctor}} instead, since he has superglued various novelty items to his face. Since this is Lisa's last chance to see the exhibit, she phones Homer to ask him if she can take the bus. He seems uncertain, which prompts her to trick him into letting her take the bus.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the native computer software, there are online JavaScript IDEs, debugging aids that are themselves written in JavaScript and built to run on the Web. An example is the program JSLint, developed by Douglas Crockford {{who has written extensively}} on the language. JSLint scans JavaScript code for conformance to a set of standards and guidelines. Many libraries for JavaScript, such as three.js, provide links to demonstration code that can be edited by users. They are also used as a pedagogical tool by institutions such as Khan Academy to allow students to experience writing code in an environment where <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> output of their programs, without needing any setup beyond a Web browser.|$|E

2500|$|... "For too long, we...were {{imbued with}} the {{ideology}} of a 'united' workers' movement. Only after the revolution did the split become unavoidable. There was a sharp polarization. The bourgeois dictatorship in Finland gave the extreme {{right wing of the}} old Social Democracy 'freedom' of organization and of the press {{for the express purpose of}} pacifying the workers. These traitors did their best to defeat the revolution the Finnish proletariat had made the previous year and to propagandize for a peaceful workers' movement functioning through parliament, trade unions, and cooperatives.... But the admonitions of those bourgeois lackeys are alien to the masses, who are tormented by prison, hunger, and poverty. The workers' memories of the White Terror are still fresh, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> living example of the proletarian dictatorship in Russia." ...|$|E
