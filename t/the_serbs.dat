5|$|After O'Grady {{was shot}} down, {{tensions}} increased greatly between NATO and the Bosnian Serbs. A number of US commanders called for immediate retaliatory air strikes; however, <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> still held {{the majority of}} the hostages seized after the bombing of Pale. The threat to the hostages prevented NATO from acting more forcefully, and <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> released 121 hostages immediately after the incident in an effort to cool tensions. Nonetheless, the situation remained explosive for the next six days until O'Grady was rescued on 8 June by the 3rd Battalion 8th Marines 2nd Marine Division, ending the calls for immediate offensive action. Shortly thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> released the remaining hostages. As a result of the incident, NATO ordered that all further sorties be accompanied by aircraft designed for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD).|$|E
5|$|On his {{northern}} frontier Manuel expended considerable {{effort to}} preserve the conquests made by Basil II over one hundred years earlier and maintained, sometimes tenuously, ever since. Due to distraction from his neighbours on the Balkan frontier, Manuel was kept from his main objective, the subjugation of the Normans of Sicily. Relations had been good with <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> and Hungarians since 1129, so the Serb rebellion came as a shock. <b>The</b> <b>Serbs</b> of Rascia, being so induced by Roger II of Sicily, invaded Byzantine territory in 1149.|$|E
5|$|A {{war with}} Serbia in 1331–1334 proved less {{successful}} for the Emperor when several towns in Macedonia were captured by <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> {{led by the}} renegade Syrgiannes Palaiologos. These gains were only curtailed when the assassination of Syrgiannes {{and the threat of}} a Hungarian invasion forced the Serbian ruler, Stefan Dušan, to seek a negotiated settlement. The subsequent peace treaty concluded between Andronikos III and Dušan was important for the future of Byzantine-Serbian relations. For the first time, the Byzantines recognized the extensive gains <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> had made at the Empire's expense in the central Balkans during Andronikos II's reign. In the aftermath of the pact, Dušan also moved his seat, and with it his realm's centre of gravity, south to Prilep.|$|E

5|$|Around 23:00 on 15 August, {{elements}} of the Serbian 1st Combined Division encountered outposts {{set up by the}} invading Austro-Hungarian army on the slopes of Cer Mountain and fighting erupted. The Austro-Hungarian positions were lightly held, and their defenders were driven back away from the mountain. By midnight, fierce clashes between the Austro-Hungarians and <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> were underway and chaos ensued in the darkness. By the morning of 16 August, the Serbians had seized the Divača Range and dislodged the Austro-Hungarians from their positions in the village of Borino Selo. The Austro-Hungarians, who had suffered heavy casualties during the fighting, retreated in some disorder. As the day progressed, <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> drove the 21st Infantry Division off the slopes of Cer to prevent it from linking with the 2nd Army in Šabac.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic {{groups within}} the American diocese began to re-align {{themselves}} with other national churches. In 1918, a group of Ukrainians in Canada formed the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church in Canada, and in 1922, the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America was established. In 1926, <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> aligned with the Serbian Orthodox Church.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 18 August, the Austro-Hungarians {{launched}} another attack, {{with the intention of}} pushing the 1st Šumadija Division off the Šabac bridgehead to allow the 5th Army to advance. However, the attack failed as <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> defeated the Austro-Hungarians at the Dobrava River, forcing their surviving soldiers to withdraw. Elsewhere, the Serbian 2nd Army's counter-offensive continued along the Cer and Iverak, with the 1st Combined Division attacking the village of Rašulijača and coming under severe pressure at Kosanin Grad. The first Serbian assault was fought off, but a wave of further attacks followed throughout the night. In {{the early morning}} of 19 August, <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> finally defeated the Austro-Hungarians and seized the small town. The 1st Morava Division drove the 9th Infantry Division from its position and fought off the division's subsequent counterattack, inflicting heavy losses. The 4th Corps renewed its attack against the Šumadija Division, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> to withdraw having only sustained light casualties. Because the 4th Corps did not break <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> the Austro-Hungarian division was unable to alter the direction of its advance towards Cer Mountain, since doing so would have put the Šumadija Division in a position to attack the 4th Corps from the rear. As a result, the 4th Corps was unable to join other Austro-Hungarian forces fighting at Cer.|$|E

5|$|The Balkan Wars {{had only}} just {{concluded}} and Serbia was still recovering. Over 36,000 Serbian soldiers had been killed and 55,000 seriously wounded. Few recruits had been gained from the newly acquired territories, and the Serbian Army had been stretched {{by the need to}} garrison them against Albanian insurgents and the threat of Bulgarian attack. To compound matters, <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> were dangerously short of artillery, and {{had only just}} begun to replenish their ammunition stocks. Their supply problems also extended to more basic items. Many soldiers lacked any uniform other than a standard issue greatcoat and a traditional Serbian cap known as a šajkača. Rifles were also in critically short supply. It was estimated that full mobilization would see some 50,000 Serbian soldiers with no equipment at all. The Austro-Hungarians, on the other hand, possessed an abundance of modern rifles and had twice as many machine guns and field guns as <b>the</b> <b>Serbs.</b> They also had better stocks of munitions, as well as much better transport and industrial infrastructure behind them. <b>The</b> <b>Serbs</b> had a slight advantage over the Austro-Hungarians as many of their soldiers were experienced veterans of the Balkan Wars and better trained than their Austro-Hungarian counterparts. Serb soldiers were also highly motivated, which compensated in part for their lack of weaponry.|$|E
5|$|According to the 1991 census, the {{municipality}} of Bijeljina had approximately 97,000 inhabitants.

5|$|Although Operation Backstop {{was within}} the UNPROFOR mandate (since the peacekeepers were {{authorised}} {{to use force to}} prevent armed incursions into the UNPAs), Croatian authorities resented the operation.

5|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{success of the}} First Serbian Uprising, by 1813 the Ottomans had reoccupied vast areas of Serbia {{that had once been}} under rebel control and {{captured}} Belgrade. Once Serbia was firmly in their control, the Ottomans carried out numerous revenge killings throughout the countryside. Following these attacks, the Grand Vizier declared an amnesty, and many Serbs who had gone into hiding returned to their homes. Given Serbia's lack of good roads, the Ottomans had to rely on some of the former Serb rebels, such as Stanoje Glavaš and Miloš Obrenović, to maintain order and collect taxes on their behalf. This arrangement remained unchanged until early 1815, when the Ottomans turned on some of the former rebels and killed them. Rumours of an impending Ottoman assault spread quickly throughout Serbia. In April 1815, on Palm Sunday, Serb elders and leaders met in the village of Takovo and elected Obrenović their leader. Shortly afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> rose in revolt, inflicting a series of humiliating defeats on the Ottomans, in what {{came to be known as}} the Second Serbian Uprising. In subsequent peace treaties, <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> were granted autonomy, and Obrenović was recognized as the Prince of Serbia.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Serb</b> Democratic Forum did not invite <b>the</b> Independent Democratic <b>Serb</b> Party to {{sign the}} open letter, taking the view that, {{as part of the}} government, they hold some {{responsibility}} for the marginalization of the Serbian minority.

5|$|In May 1992, {{intensive}} shelling and infantry {{attacks on}} Bosniak {{areas in the}} municipality caused the Bosniak survivors to flee their homes. The majority of them surrendered or were captured by Serb forces. As the Serb forces rounded up the Bosniak and Croat residents, they forced them to march in columns bound for {{one or another of}} the prison camps that the Serb authorities had established in the municipality. On about 25 May 1992, about three weeks after <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> took control of the municipal government, and two days after the start of large scale military attacks on Bosniak population centers, Serb forces began taking prisoners to the Omarska camp. During the next several weeks, <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> continued to round up Bosniaks and Croats from Kozarac near Prijedor, and other places in the municipality and send them to the camps. Many Bosniak and Croat intellectuals and politicians were sent to Omarska. While virtually all of the prisoners were male, there were also 37 women detained in the camp, who served food and cleaned the walls of the torture rooms, and were repeatedly raped in the canteen; bodies of five of them have been exhumed.|$|E
5|$|In early 1804, {{following}} a massacre of Serb chieftains by renegade Ottoman janissaries known as Dahis, <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> of the Pashalik rebelled. Karađorđe was unanimously elected {{to lead the}} uprising against the Dahis at an assembly of surviving chiefs in February 1804. Within six months, most of the Dahi leaders had been captured and executed by Karađorđe's forces, and by 1805, the final remnants of Dahi resistance had been crushed. Karađorđe and his followers now demanded far-reaching autonomy, a move which Sultan Selim interpreted as but the first step towards complete independence. Selim promptly declared jihad against the rebels and ordered an army to march into the Pashalik. The Ottomans suffered a string of defeats {{at the hands of}} Karađorđe's forces. By 1806, the rebels had captured all the major towns in the Pashalik, including Belgrade and Smederevo, and expelled their Muslim inhabitants. Burdened by the demands of the Russo-Ottoman War of 1806–1812, Selim offered to grant <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> extensive autonomy but Karađorđe refused in light of Russia's avowal to provide extensive aid to the rebels should they continue fighting.|$|E
