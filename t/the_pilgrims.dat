They looked at the eventual failure of the Wessagussett settlement as Divine Providence against a sinful people.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pilgrims</b> were Brownist English Dissenters; {{they sought}} {{a version of}} the Christian {{religion}} without things they deemed nonessential, such as bishops or Christmas.

5|$|The Pilgrim {{settlers}} {{realized that}} they did not have a patent to settle in the region, so they signed the Mayflower Compact prior to disembarking. <b>The</b> <b>Pilgrims</b> explored various parts of Cape Cod, and eventually sought a suitable location for a permanent settlement to the westward in Cape Cod Bay. <b>The</b> <b>Pilgrims</b> eventually came across the sheltered waters of Plymouth Harbor on December 17.

A party of ten men {{under the leadership of}} Myles Standish set out to find and execute Corbitant. While hunting for Corbitant, they learned that Squanto had escaped and Massasoit was back in power. Several Native Americans had been injured by Standish and his men and were offered medical attention in Plymouth. They had failed to capture Corbitant, but the show of force by Standish had garnered respect for <b>the</b> <b>Pilgrims</b> and, as a result, nine of the most powerful sachems in the area signed a treaty in September, including Massasoit and Corbitant, pledging their loyalty to King James.|$|E
