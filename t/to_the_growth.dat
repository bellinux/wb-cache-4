5|$|After the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was {{ratified}} in 1920, the Russian SFSR recognized Lithuanian {{claims to}} the Vilnius Region and continued to support them. In its responses to the 1938 ultimatum, the Soviet Union expressed concerns over Lithuania's independence and threatened to abrogate the Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1932. It made it clear, though, {{that it did not}} wish to be drawn into an armed conflict. This stance has been attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> of a threat from Japan; armed assistance to Lithuania would have required the Red Army to invade either Poland or Latvia and could have resulted in a war on two fronts. The Soviets urged France, a major ally of Poland at the time, to de-escalate the conflict and encourage a more moderate version of the ultimatum. France and the United Kingdom, preoccupied with the Anschluss, pressured Lithuania to normalize the relationship with Poland as soon as possible. They feared that the ultimatum had been approved by Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the bark}} {{functions}} as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew {{their way through the}} cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were killed by this disease.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this study}} we have {{provided}} simple analytical formulae <b>to</b> estimate <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> rate of a nucleation mode due <b>to</b> self-coagulation and <b>the</b> apparent <b>growth</b> rate due to coagulation scavenging by larger particles. These formulae were used {{on a set of}} simulations covering a wide range of atmospheric conditions. <b>The</b> modal <b>growth</b> rates were deter-mined from the simulation results by summing the contribu-tion of each process, by calculating the increase rate in the count mean diameter of the mode and by following the peak concentration of the mode. The results of these three meth-ods were compared with each other and <b>the</b> means used <b>to</b> estimate <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> rate due <b>to</b> self-coagulation and coagu-lation scavenging were found to give accurate values. We also investigated the role of charged particles and electric interactions in <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> of a nucleation mode. Charged particles were found <b>to</b> increase <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> rate due <b>to</b> both self-coagulation and coagulation scavenging by a factor of ∼ 1. 5 to 2. In case of increased condensation onto charged particles, <b>the</b> total condensational <b>growth</b> rate of a nucleation mode may increase significantly in the very early steps of <b>the</b> <b>growth.</b> <b>The</b> analytical formulae provided by this paper were designed <b>to</b> provide <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> rates due <b>to</b> different processes from aerosol dynamic simulations, but the same principles can be used <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> rates from measurement data. ...|$|R

5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{has not been}} levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> of the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s, a {{political}} debate started concerning {{whether or not}} a new main airport should be built for Oslo and Eastern Norway. A government report launched in 1970, suggested surveys for five locations: Gardermoen, Hurum, Askim, Nesodden and Ås. Hobøl was preliminarily selected and areas reserved for a future airport. During the 1970s, the Labour Party became concerned that Hobøl was located too centrally in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> areas around Oslo, and instead wanted to use Gardermoen, in an attempt to force the population growth further north. Commercial interests and the airlines supported Hobøl. In 1983, Parliament decided to abandon the plans for Hobøl and continue with a divided solution. Fornebu would be expanded, and all charter traffic be moved to Gardermoen. From 1988, all international traffic would also be moved, making Fornebu a purely domestic airport.|$|E

Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro-organisms, a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes.
