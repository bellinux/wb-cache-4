5|$|Spatial {{economics}} {{deal with}} distance and area, {{and how these}} may affect a market through <b>transportation</b> <b>costs</b> and geographical limitations. The development of spatial economics is usually ascribed to German economist Johann Heinrich von Thünen; however, Cantillon addressed spatial economics nearly a century earlier. Cantillon integrated his advancements in spatial economic theory into his microeconomic analysis of the market, describing how <b>transportation</b> <b>costs</b> influence the location of factories, markets and population centres—that is, individuals strive to lower <b>transportation</b> <b>costs.</b> Conclusions on spatial economics were derived from three premises: cost of raw materials of equal quality will always be higher near the capital city, due to transportation costs; <b>transportation</b> <b>costs</b> vary on transportation type (for example, water transportation was considered cheaper than land-based transportation); and larger goods that {{are more difficult to}} transport will always be cheaper closer to their area of production. For example, Cantillon believed markets were designed as they were to decrease costs to both merchants and villagers in terms of time and transportation. Similarly, Cantillon posited that the locations of cities were the result in large part of the wealth of inhabiting property owners and their ability to afford transportation costs—wealthier property owners tended to live farther from their property, because they could afford the <b>transportation</b> <b>costs.</b> In Essai, spatial economic theory was used to derive why markets occupied the geographical area they did and why costs varied across different markets.|$|E

The experience gave him {{a sense of the}} vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep <b>transportation</b> <b>costs.</b> In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one, but that it went the deepest.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} on the joint vendor-buyer problem focused on the production shipment schedule in terms of number {{and the size of}} batches transferred between two parties. It is a fact that <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> is {{a major part of the}} total <b>cost.</b> However, the <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> is only considered implicitly as a part of fixed setup or ordering cost and thus the <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> is assumed to be independent of the size of the shipment. As such, the effect of the <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> is not adequately reflected in final planning decisions. There is a need for models involving <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> explicitly for better decision-making. In this study we analyze the vendor buyer lot-sizing problem under equal-size shipment policy. We introduce the complete solution of the problem in an explicit and extended manner that has not existed in the literature. We also consider the case where <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> is taken into account. The structure of the <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> is assumed to be an all-unit-discounted format.

30|$|If {{we think}} {{practically}} {{the meaning of}} safety factor in the transportation problem, it is very large because the total <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> varies if the safety factor increases or decreases in some transportation problem. In this manuscript, we formulated five models with numerical example and solved these models using three methods, namely expected value modeling, chance-constrained programming, and an approach using interval approximation of fuzzy number. We have seen that if we introduce a safety factor in a transportation problem, the <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> for the whole transportation system increases, which was found in these five models. The <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> for the second, third, fourth, and fifth models were more than the <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> of the first model due to the safety factor.|$|R

The high cost of the film was attributed to the <b>transportation</b> <b>costs</b> incurred to move chariots from Chennai to Kurukshetra, where the war sequences were filmed. Permission from the government was sought, cavalry and infantry from the Indian Army {{were brought to the}} locations at Kurukshetra and the first rows of the charging armies on horses and elephants had soldiers from the Indian Army. The battle scenes were shot with troupes of the 61 Cavalry Regiment, using 80 elephants, 400 horses and three cameras. Other scenes were shot at palaces in Jaipur. Shooting for Karnan also took place at the Bangalore Palace in the Cantonment area, making it the first film to be shot there.|$|E

A {{microchip}} contained within the card stores its value, {{as well as the}} rider’s most recent entry and exit points, and a unique identifier. However, the unique identifier is not linked to a person’s name or identity, unless one registers the card online. Registering SmarTrip cards allows riders to recover their remaining balance (minus a $5 replacement fee), should the card be lost, stolen, or damaged. The unique identifier also allows workers enrolled in the SmartBenefits program, which allows employers to subsidize employee <b>transportation</b> <b>costs</b> tax-free, to credit their monthly benefits to their cards.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} {{choosing}} an open register are varied and include tax avoidance, {{the ability to}} avoid national labor and environmental regulations, {{and the ability to}} hire crews from lower-wage countries. National or closed registries typically require a ship be owned and constructed by national interests, and at least partially crewed by its citizens. Conversely, open registries frequently offer on-line registration with few questions asked. The use of flags of convenience lowers registration and maintenance costs, which in turn reduces overall <b>transportation</b> <b>costs.</b> The accumulated advantages can be significant, for example in 1999, 28 of the American company SeaLand's fleet of 63 ships were foreign-flagged, saving the company up to 3.5 million dollars per ship every year.|$|E

5|$|The {{series of}} taxes levied on oil {{production}} in Alaska has changed several times since 1977, {{but the overall}} form remains mostly the same. Alaska receives royalties from oil production on state land. The state also has a property tax on oil production structures and transportation (pipeline) property—the only state property tax in Alaska. There is a special corporate income tax on petroleum companies, and the state taxes the amount of petroleum produced. This production tax is levied {{on the cost of}} oil at Pump Station 1. To calculate this tax, the state takes the market value of the oil, subtracts <b>transportation</b> <b>costs</b> (tanker and pipeline tariffs), subtracts production costs, then multiplies the resulting amount per barrel of oil produced each month. The state then takes a percentage of the dollar figure produced.|$|E

5|$|Having recovered, {{the company}} worked to expand {{geographically}} into markets like Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., {{and by the}} end of 1998 reported that revenue had surpassed pre-crisis levels. Growth continued over subsequent years, in part through the $29million acquisition of Fresh Samantha, a large juice company based in Saco, Maine, in 2000. This allowed Odwalla to expand into additional East Coast markets, but incurred high <b>transportation</b> <b>costs</b> as products had to be shipped across the United States from California. To address this problem the company announced plans to build a second production facility in Palm Beach County, Florida. However, facing difficulties in obtaining building permits and allocating sufficient funds, the project was first delayed and eventually cancelled.

40|$|Transportation models play an {{important}} role in logistics and supply chain management for reducing cost and improving service. In this paper two new fuzzy transportation linear programming models are developed: one with equality constraints and other with inequality constraints using L-R fuzzy numbers. The membership functions of L-R fuzzy numbers of fuzzy <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> are consider being linear and exponential. This paper develops a procedure to derive the fuzzy objective value of the fuzzy transportation problem, in that the cost coefficients and the supply and demand are L-R fuzzy numbers. The two models are illustrated with an example. The optimal fuzzy <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> for the two models slightly varies when linear membership functions are equal and the optimal fuzzy <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> is same in case of different membership functions i. e., either linear or exponential membership functions defined on L-R fuzzy numbers. Most of the fuzzy transportation problems reviewed in literature have the negative optimal fuzzy <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> but in our proposed method we obtain positive optimal fuzzy <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> in all most all cases.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a location model that assigns online demands to the capacitated regional warehouses currently serving in-store demands in a multi-channel supply chain. The model explicitly considers the trade-off between the risk pooling effect and the <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> in a two-echelon inventory/logistics system. Keeping the delivery network of the in-store demands unchanged, the model aims {{to minimize the}} <b>transportation</b> <b>cost,</b> inventory cost, and fixed handling cost in the system when assigning the online demands. We formulate the assignment problem as a non-linear integer programming model. Lagrangian relaxation based procedures are proposed to solve the model, both the general case and an important special case. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of our algorithms. Furthermore, we find {{that because of the}} pooling effect the variance of in-store demands currently served by a warehouse is an important parameter of the warehouse when it is considered as a candidate for supplying online demands. Highly uncertain in-store demands, as well as low <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> per unit, can make a warehouse appealing. We illustrate with numerical examples the trade-off between the pooling effect and the <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> in the assignment problem. We also evaluate the cost savings between the policy derived from the model, which integrates the <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> with the pooling effect, and the commonly used policy, which is based only on the <b>transportation</b> <b>cost.</b> Results show that the derived policy can reduce 1. 5 - 7. 5 % cost in average and in many instances the percentage of cost savings is more than 10 %.
