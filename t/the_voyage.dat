5|$|The {{passengers}} and crew of both vessels consulted on whether to continue southwards or turn back and await better weather. According to one source, missionary W.P.

As Houstoun was the nominal commander of <b>the</b> <b>voyage</b> his view prevailed and Integrity and Contest returned to Port Jackson together, arriving on 13 July.|$|E

25|$|During {{the course}} of <b>the</b> <b>voyages,</b> Ming China had become the {{pre-eminent}} naval power of the early 15th century. The Yongle Emperor had extended imperial control over foreign lands during the span of <b>the</b> <b>voyages.</b> However, in 1433, <b>the</b> <b>voyages</b> ceased and Ming China {{turned away from the}} seas. It is not exactly known why <b>the</b> <b>voyages</b> completely ended in 1433. Duyvendak suggested that the complete cessation of the expeditions was partly due to the considerable expenses. Whatever it may be, the costs for undertaking <b>the</b> <b>voyages</b> had not overburdened the Ming treasury. The trade was still flourishing long after <b>the</b> <b>voyages</b> had ceased. Chinese ships continued to control the Eastern Asian maritime trade. They also continued trading around India and East Africa.|$|R

5|$|Aside {{from the}} probe, <b>The</b> <b>Voyage</b> Home {{required}} no new starship designs. The USS Saratoga, the first Federation starship disabled by the probe, was the USS Reliant model from The Wrath of Khan. The Bird-of-Prey model from The Search for Spock was reused, but ILM built additional sturdy versions for <b>The</b> <b>Voyage</b> Homes action sequences. The {{inside of the}} Bird-of-Prey was represented by a different set than The Search for Spock, but the designers made sure to adhere to a sharp and alien architectural aesthetic. To give the set a smokier, atmospheric look, the designers rigged display and instrumentation lights to be bright enough that they could light the characters, {{rather than relying on}} ambient or rigged lighting. While Paramount had instructed ILM to trash the large Spacedock model created for The Search for Spock, the team had been loath to discard the complicated model and its miles of fiber optic lighting. When <b>The</b> <b>Voyage</b> Home called for the return of Spacedock, ILM had only to reassemble the model from storage.|$|E

5|$|His tasks {{included}} finding {{experts to}} examine and report on his collections from <b>the</b> <b>voyage.</b> Darwin proposed to edit these reports, writing his own forewords and notes, and used his contacts to lobby for government sponsorship of publication of these findings as a large book. When a Treasury grant of £1,000 was allocated {{at the end of}} August 1837, Darwin stretched the project to include the geology book that he had conceived in April 1832 at the first landfall in <b>the</b> <b>voyage.</b> He selected Smith, Elder & Co. as the publisher, and gave them unrealistic commitments on the timing of providing the text and illustrations. He assured the Treasury that the work would be good value, as the publisher would only require a small commission profit, and he himself would have no profit. From October he planned what became the multi-volume Zoology of <b>the</b> <b>Voyage</b> of H.M.S. Beagle on his collections, and began writing about the geology of volcanic islands.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 15th century, the {{countries}} of the Iberian peninsula began to sponsor exploration beyond the boundaries of Europe. Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal (d. 1460) sent expeditions that discovered the Canary Islands, the Azores, and Cape Verde during his lifetime. After his death, exploration continued; Bartolomeu Dias (d. 1500) went around the Cape of Good Hope in 1486 and Vasco da Gama (d. 1524) sailed around Africa to India in 1498. The combined Spanish monarchies of Castile and Aragon sponsored <b>the</b> <b>voyage</b> of exploration by Christopher Columbus (d. 1506) in 1492 that discovered the Americas.

5|$|The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs, Being {{the first}} part of the geology of <b>the</b> <b>voyage</b> of the Beagle, under the command of Capt. Fitzroy, R.N. during the years 1832 to 1836, was {{published}} in 1842 as Charles Darwin's first monograph, and set out his theory of the formation of coral reefs and atolls. He conceived of the idea during <b>the</b> <b>voyage</b> of the Beagle while still in South America, before he had seen a coral island, and wrote it out as HMS Beagle crossed the Pacific Ocean, completing his draft by November 1835. At the time there was great scientific interest in the way that coral reefs formed, and Captain Robert FitzRoy's orders from the Admiralty included the investigation of an atoll as an important scientific aim of <b>the</b> <b>voyage.</b> FitzRoy chose to survey the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean. The results supported Darwin's theory that the various types of coral reefs and atolls could be explained by uplift and subsidence of vast areas of the Earth's crust under the oceans.|$|E
