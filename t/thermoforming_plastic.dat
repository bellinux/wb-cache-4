40|$|During <b>thermoforming,</b> <b>plastic</b> {{sheets are}} heated and {{subsequently}} deformed {{through the application}} of mechanical stretching and/or pressure. This process directly impacts sheet properties such as material thickness in walls, corners, and bottom, crystallinity in the constituent layers, and particularly the oxygen gas permeability. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the impact of thermoforming on thickness and oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of selected packaging materials (polypropylene (PP); PP/ethylene-vinyl alcohol co-polymer/PP (PP/EVOH/PP); polystyrene/EVOH/polyethylene (PS/EVOH/PE); amorphous polyethylene terephtalate/PE (APET/PE); APET/PE/EVOH/PE; polyamide/PE (PA/PE); and (PE/) PA/EVOH/PA/PE). These materials were extruded in two different thicknesses and thermoformed into trays with the same top dimensions and variable depths of 25, 50, and/or 75 mm and a 50 mm tray with a variable radius of the corners. The distribution of the material thickness in the trays was visualized, showing the locations that were most affected by the deep drawn process. The OTR results indicate that the calculated OTR, based on a homogeneous material distribution, can be used as a rough approximation of the measured OTR. However, detailed analysis of crystallization and unequal thinning, which is also related to the tray design, remains necessary to explain the deviation of the measured OTR as compared to the predicted one...|$|E

Salah satunya adalah penyusutan. Penyusutan sering terjadi pada proses pembentukan plastik, terutama pembentukan dengan sistem {{mechanical}} thermoforming. Sehingga perlu dianalisis hal-hal yang menyebabkan penyusutan pada produk yang dihasilkan. Beberapa hal yang diidentifikasi mempengaruhi terjadinya penyusutan adalah bentuk mold, temperatur, dan jenis plastik yang digunakan. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah membuat alat uji mechanical thermoforming dan  membuat  mold  yang  akan  digunakan  untuk  menganalisis  penyusutan.   Mold yang digunakan ada 2 macam, yaitu mold telapak kaki atas dan mold telapak kaki bawah. Selain variasi pada mold, analisis juga ditujukan pada temperatur plastik polypropylene (PP) dan plastik PVC yang akan diproses. Variasi temperatur yaitu: 1000 C,  1200 C,  dan  140 oC.   Sedangkan  jenis  plastik  yang  diujikan  adalah  plastik polypropylene (PP) dan plastik PVC. Dari data hasil pengujian dan pembahasan pada proses mechanical thermoforming untuk plastik polypropylene (PP) dengan ketebalan 1, 0 mm tidak dapat dianalisis persentase penyusutan yang terjadi karena sifat viskos pada plastik rendah. Pada plastik jenis PP ini meskipun membentuk pola, tetapi tidak sempurna. Bahan plastik PP setelah proses penekanan dengan temperatur 100 ºC- 120 ºC plastik tidak mengalami pemuaian yang cukup baik, karena plastik masih bersifat elastik. Pada temperatur 140 ºC plastik mengalami pemuaian, tetapi saat proses penekanan plastik mengalami bentuk pola yang tidak sempurna, karena temperatur terlalu tinggi. Sedangkan pada plastik PVC didapatkan hasil bahwa pada mold telapak kaki atas dengan ketinggian 2 cm dan tebal plastik 1, 0 mm menghasilkan persentase penyusutan rata-rata 7, 85 % dengan temperatur 100 ºC, 9, 80 % dengan temperatur 120 ºC dan 12, 11 % dengan temperatur 140 ºC. Pada mold telapak kaki bawah dengan ketinggian 2 cm dan tebal plastik 1, 0 mm menghasilkan persentase penyusutan rata-rata 10, 01 % dengan temperatur 100 ºC, 10, 96 % dengan temperatur 120 ºC dan 12, 08 % dengan temperatur 140 ºC.   Kata Kunci: Mechanical thermoforming, penyusutan plastik, mold   ABSTRACT   The growing {{of industry}} {{has the effect}} to the increase of plastic need.  However, the application of plastic forming process often experiences constraints. One of them is depreciation. Depreciation often occurs in the plastic forming process, especially forming with mechanical thermoforming system. So {{it is necessary to}} analyze the things that cause shrinkage on the product. Some {{of the things that are}} identified to influence the shrinkage are the molds, temperatures and types of used plastics. The used method is to make mechanical thermoforming test and make mold which will be used to analyze depreciation. There are 2 kinds of molds, namely upper foot sole mold and bottom foot sole mold. In addition to the variations of the mold, the analysis is also aimed at the temperature of polypropylene plastic (PP) and PVC plastic which will be processed. The temperature variations are 1000 C, 1200 C and 140 oC and the types of plastics that are tested is polypropylene plastic (PP) and PVC plastic. The results show that on mechanical thermoforming process for polypropylene (PP) plastic with 1. 0 mm thickness, the percentage of shrinkage can not be analyzed because of the low viscous nature of plastic. PP type plastic can form a pattern, but not perfect. PP plastic material does not experience a good expansion after pressing process with 100 ºC- 120 ºC plastic temperature. This is because the plastic is still elastic. At 140 ºC, the plastic undergoes expansion, but when the plastic pressing process, it undergoes an imperfect pattern. The reason is the temperature is too high. Meanwhile for the PVC plastic, it was found that in the upper foot sole mold with height of 2 cm and 1. 0 mm plastic thickness, the percentages of shrinkage average are 7. 85 % with temperature 100 ºC, 9. 80 % with temperature 120 ºC and 12. 11 % with temperature of 140 ºC. In the bottom foot sole mold with 2 cm height and 1. 0 mm plastic thickness, the percentages of shrinkage average are 10. 01 % with temperature 100 ºC, 10. 96 % with temperature 120 ºC and 12. 08 % with temperature 140 ºC.   Keywords: Mechanical <b>thermoforming,</b> <b>plastic</b> shrinkage, mol...|$|E

The technique could also be used to produce items for special terrestrial uses in which minimization of weight is a primary design consideration. Although the inherent strengths of thermoplastics are clearly inferior to those of metals and composite materials, thermoplastics offer a distinct advantage in that they can be shaped, at elevated temperatures, to replicate surfaces (e. g., prescribed mirror surfaces) precisely. Furthermore, multiple elements can be bonded into structures of homogeneous design that display minimal thermal deformation aside from simple expansion. The design aspect of the present technique is based on the principle that the deflection of a plate that has internal structure depends far more on the overall thickness than on the internal details; thus, a very stiff, light structure can be made from thin plastic that is heatformed to produce a sufficiently high moment of inertia. General examples of such structures include I beams and eggcrates...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} work {{details the}} design and fabrication of a tabletop thermoform machine {{with the goal of}} making this machine cheaper than the ones on the market, yet able to fulfill specific requirements. These functional requirements include creating parts that have dimensions within. 05 " of the original part; <b>thermoforming</b> <b>plastics</b> that range between a 3 " x 3 " and 12 " x 12 " size; and having the ability to heat the plastic to at least 150 °C in order to <b>thermoform</b> <b>plastics</b> such as polycarbonate. In addition, this machine had to be simple to manufacture and use. In order to achieve these requirements, a top to bottom drape forming architecture with a four bar linear slider and carriage, was constructed. In order to constrain the plastics of different sizes, two similar, modular wooden plates were used such that the plastic was held in between them via t-nuts and screws. When the user clamps the plastic onto the carriage, he or she slides the carriage upwards to an oven that radiates heat via nichrome wire on a mica sheet. Once the desired temperature is reached, the user then slides the carriage down onto a vacuum box platform, where a mold is present, and forms the plastic over the mold. While that happens, a negative pressure is applied inside the box via a standard commercial vacuum, so that the plastic adheres more closely to the mold. For the testing process, this work focuses on two manufacturing strategies for thermoforming parts: heating the air to the glass transition temperature before thermoforming, and heating the plastic to the glass transition temperature before thermoforming. Once this test was performed, the dimension of each plastic part was examined in order to see if the tolerance levels were reached. In addition, this test determined {{whether or not there was}} a statistical significance between the qualities of parts made by either of these processes. In the end, the thermoform machine was only able to reach an average tolerance of. 07 " for the created parts. In addition, there was no statistical significance between the part qualities of either one of the tested manufacturing processes. Some of the main reasons behind this include having an ineffective vacuum box and clamp design issues, which will be focused on in the future iteration of this project. by Akwasi Owusu-Akyaw.

A motion analysis system with two video cameras placed on the lateral and rear sides of the subject together with one force platform was used to investigate the immediate effects of the orthotic treatment. The force platform collected force data and the two cameras captured two-dimensional displacement data of the lower limb. Eight subjects, all having an arch index (AI) larger than 3. 0, participated in the study. For each subject, three successful steps on the force platform were videotaped for both the shod (with shoe only) and the orthotic (with shoe and orthosis) conditions. The kinetic variables were normalized to individual body weight and averaged for each subject. A Paired t-test was conducted to analyse sample means of matched pairs between the shod and the orthotic conditions.

40|$|Compound {{semiconductors}} are {{the basis}} of modern optoelectronics due to their intrinsically superior optical and electronic properties compared with elemental semiconductors. However, their applications remain limited due to a prohibitive substrate cost. This limitation has driven the development of epitaxial lift-off (ELO) technology that separates the thin-film epitaxial layer from the substrate by selectively removing a sacrificial layer between them. However, ELO has its own limitations including a long process time, complicated transfer to a secondary, low cost host substrate, and wafer surface degradation which prevents wafer recycling. In this thesis, we address all of these limitations by developing a new, non-destructive ELO (ND-ELO) process. When combined with adhesive-free cold-weld bonding of the wafer directly to a plastic substrate, ND-ELO provides an approximately 100 times reduction in process time, and a considerably simplified transfer process compared with conventional ELO. Furthermore, it allows indefinite wafer reuse by employing the epitaxial protection layers, eliminating surface degradation of the parent wafer encountered in conventional ELO. We demonstrate the feasibility and generality of this process by applying it to optoelectronic devices including photovoltaic cells, LEDs, MESFETs and photodetectors on two compound semiconductor systems, InP and GaAs. Furthermore, we present an approach that can achieve an estimated cost of only 3 % that of conventional GaAs solar cells using an accelerated ND-ELO wafer recycling process, and integrated with lightweight, <b>thermoformed</b> <b>plastic,</b> truncated mini-compound parabolic concentrators (CPC) that avoid the need for active solar tracking. Using solar cell/CPC assemblies, without daily solar tracking, the annual energy harvesting is increased by 2. 8 times compared with planar solar cells. This represents a drastic cost reduction in both the module and balance of systems costs compared with heavy, rigid conventional modules and trackers that are subject to wind loading damage and high installation costs. The demonstration of cost-efficient and high performance compound semiconductor-based flexible thin-film optoelectronics is a critical step toward allowing their widespread deployment in mainstream state-of-the-art applications including wearable, flexible and conformal devices...|$|R

There are numerous efforts underway to improve duct system efficiency. Most of these involve modifications to current technology such as air sealing techniques like mastic and aeroseal, snap together duct connections, and greater levels of insulation. This project sought to make a more significant stride forward by introducing a duct system of a material that can be more readily sealed and can exhibit lower friction losses.
