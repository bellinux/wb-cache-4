50|$|CFM {{has been}} {{primarily}} developed by Charles Lieber at Harvard University in 1994. The method was demonstrated using hydrophobicity where polar molecules (e.g. COOH) {{tend to have}} the strongest binding to each other, followed by nonpolar (e.g. CH3-CH3) bonding, and a combination being the weakest. Probe tips are functionalized and substrates patterned with these molecules. All combinations of functionalization were tested, both by <b>tip</b> <b>contact</b> and removal as well as spatial mapping of substrates patterned with both moieties and observing the complementarity in image contrast. Both of these methods are discussed below. The AFM instrument used {{is similar to the}} one in Figure 1.|$|E
50|$|In some three-conductor TRS phone inserts, {{the concept}} is {{extended}} by using specially designed phone jacks that will accept a mono phone plug partly inserted to the first click and will then connect the tip to the signal path without breaking it. Most standard phone connectors {{can also be used}} in this way with varying success, but neither the switch contact nor the <b>tip</b> <b>contact</b> can be relied upon unless the internal contacts have been designed with extra strength for holding the plug tip in place. Even with stronger contacts, an accidental mechanical movement of the inserted plug can interrupt signal within the circuit. For maximum reliability, any usage involving first click or half-click positions will instead rewire the plug to short tip and ring together and then insert this modified plug all the way into the jack.|$|E
50|$|When {{used for}} POTS, the first wire {{is known as}} the tip or A-leg (U.K.) {{conductor}} and is usually connected to the positive side of a direct current (DC) circuit, while the second wire {{is known as the}} ring lead or B-leg (U.K.), and is connected to the negative side of the circuit. Neither of these two sides of the line has a connection to the local ground. This creates a balanced audio circuit with common-mode rejection, also known as a differential pair. The tip and ring convention is based on the ″ (6.5 mm) TRS phone connectors, which were employed in telephone switchboards in the 19th and 20th centuries, where the <b>tip</b> <b>contact</b> of the connector is separated from the ring contact by a spacer of insulation. The connection furthest from the cable is known as the tip, the middle connection is the ring, and the (largest) connection closest to the wire is the sleeve.|$|E

40|$|Resistance {{spot welding}} process {{comprises}} of electric, thermal and mechanical phenomenon, which makes this process complex and highly non-linear and thus, it becomes difficult to model it. In {{order to obtain}} good weld nugget during spot welding, hit and trial welds are usually done which is very costly. Therefore the numerical simulation {{research has been conducted}} to understand the whole process. In this paper three different cases were analyzed by varying the <b>tip</b> <b>contact</b> area and it was observed that, with the variation of <b>tip</b> <b>contact</b> area the nugget formation at the faying surface is affected. The <b>tip</b> <b>contact</b> area of the welding electrode becomes large with long welding cycles. Therefore in order to maintain consistency of nugget formation during the welding process, the current compensation in control feedback is required.

40|$|AbstractWe {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} model {{to examine the}} combined effect of gravity and microvillus length heterogeneity on <b>tip</b> <b>contact</b> force (Fzm) during free rolling in vitro, including the initiation of L-, P-, and E-selectin tethers and the threshold behavior at low shear. Fzm grows nonlinearly with shear. At shear stress of 1 dyn/cm 2, Fzm is one to two orders of magnitude greater than the 0. 1 pN force for gravitational settling without flow. At shear stresses > 0. 2 dyn/cm 2 only the longest microvilli contact the substrate; hence at the shear threshold (0. 4 dyn/cm 2 for L-selectin), only 5 % of microvilli can initiate tethering interaction. The characteristic time for <b>tip</b> <b>contact</b> is surprisingly short, typically 0. 1 – 1 ms. This model is then applied in vivo to explore the free-rolling interaction of leukocyte microvilli with endothelial glycocalyx and the necessary conditions for glycocalyx penetration to initiate cell rolling. The model predicts that for arteriolar capillaries even the longest microvilli cannot initiate rolling, except in regions of low shear or flow reversal. In postcapillary venules, where shear stress is ∼ 2 dyn/cm 2, tethering interactions are highly likely, provided {{that there are some}} relatively long microvilli. Once tethering is initiated, rolling tends to ensue because Fzm and contact duration will both increase substantially to facilitate glycocalyx penetration by the shorter microvilli...|$|E
40|$|A pre-vocalic {{connected}} speech {{context is}} said to enable the resyllabification of word-final consonants into an onset, thus conditioning alternations. We present EPG data on English word-final /l/, measuring the extent of alveolar contact {{and the rate of}} vocalisation, the extent of dorsal retraction (representing “darkness”), and the timing of alveolar contact relative to dorsal retraction. Two dialects of British English are considered, namely Scottish Standard English and Southern Standard British English. Results are that /l/ alternation is systematic: the tongue <b>tip</b> <b>contact</b> of word-final /l/, quite categorically for some speakers, is more onset-like in pre-vocalic and more coda-like in pre-consonantal contexts. This alternation is not along the lines predicted by a segmental resyllabification account, however. First, the segmental identity of the following consonant (/b/ or /h/) may be as powerful a factor in conditioning {{the presence or absence of}} alveolar contact for some speakers. Second, glottalisation of lexically vowel-initial words regularly occurs, but does not seem to condition the appearance (or otherwise) of tongue <b>tip</b> <b>contact.</b> Third, the tongue dorsum remains retracted and does not adopt an onset-like form or timing even when /l/ is pre-vocalic. Thus categorical resyllabification of a word-final /l/ segment based on phonotactic acceptability is rejected as a mechanism controlling English L-sandhi in connected speech. Instead, we propose a gestural-episodic model, in which individual gestures display different levels of coherence in lexical syllable roles, while in connected speech, segmental sequences are influenced by similarity to well-rehearsed lexical sequences, if they exist...|$|E

40|$|A biomechanical {{model is}} presented, and {{combined}} with measurements of tip press force, to estimate total user hand force associated with two pneumatic nail gun trigger systems. The contact actuation trigger (CAT) can fire a nail when the user holds the trigger depressed {{first and then}} "bumps" the nail gun tip against the workpiece. With a full sequential actuation trigger (SAT) the user must press the tip against the workpiece prior to activating the trigger. The SAT is demonstrably safer in reducing traumatic injury risk, but increases the duration (and magnitude) of tip force exertion. Time integrated (cumulative) hand force was calculated for a single user from measurements of the <b>tip</b> <b>contact</b> force with the workpiece and transfer time between nails as inputs to a static model of the nail gun and workpiece in two nailing task orientations. The model shows the hand force dependence upon {{the orientation of the}} workpiece in addition to the trigger system. Based on standard time allowances from work measurement systems (i. e. Methods-Time Measurement - 1) it is proposed that efficient application of hand force with the SAT in maintaining <b>tip</b> <b>contact</b> can reduce force exertion attributable to the sequential actuation trigger to 2 - 8 % (horizontal nailing) and 9 - 20 % (vertical nailing) of the total hand/arm force. The present model is useful for considering differences in cumulative hand/arm force exposure between the SAT and CAT systems and may explain the appeal of the CAT trigger in reducing the user's perception of muscular effort.

As long as the fiber <b>tip</b> does not <b>contact</b> tissue, it remains in near pristine condition and transmits the laser light to cause a photocoagulative tissue effect. Once the <b>tip</b> <b>contacts</b> tissue; however, degradation of the tip occurs and transmission of the laser energy is decreased. The laser energy is absorbed at the <b>contact</b> <b>tip</b> causing it to heat up. In this condition the tip can only be used for tissue incision or ablation.
