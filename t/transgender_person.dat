40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{reported}} high rates of HIV infection among male-to-female <b>transgender</b> <b>persons,</b> but little research has examined how male-to-female <b>transgender</b> <b>persons</b> manage living with HIV. We compared demographic and health characteristics of 59 male-to-female <b>transgender</b> <b>persons</b> who were HIV positive with 300 nontransgender control subjects who were HIV positive. We found several demographic {{differences between the groups}} but no significant differences in HIV-related health status.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{described}} HIV prevalence, risk behaviors, {{health care}} use, {{and mental health}} status of male-to-female and female-to-male <b>transgender</b> <b>persons</b> and determined factors associated with HIV. METHODS: We recruited <b>transgender</b> <b>persons</b> through targeted sampling, respondent-driven sampling, and agency referrals; 392 male-to-female and 123 female-to-male <b>transgender</b> <b>persons</b> were interviewed and tested for HIV. RESULTS: HIV prevalence among male-to-female <b>transgender</b> <b>persons</b> was 35 %. African American race (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5. 81; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 2. 82, 11. 96), a history of injection drug use (OR = 2. 69; 95 % CI = 1. 56, 4. 62), multiple sex partners (adjusted OR = 2. 64; 95 % CI = 1. 50, 4. 62), and low education (adjusted OR = 2. 08; 95 % CI = 1. 17, 3. 68) were independently associated with HIV. Among female-to-male <b>transgender</b> <b>persons,</b> HIV prevalence (2 %) and risk behaviors were much lower. Most male-to-female (78 %) and female-to-male (83 %) <b>transgender</b> <b>persons</b> had seen a medical provider in the past 6 months. Sixty-two percent of the male-to-female and 55 % of the female-to-male <b>transgender</b> <b>persons</b> were depressed; 32 % of each population had attempted suicide. CONCLUSIONS: High HIV prevalence suggests an urgent need for risk reduction interventions for male-to-female <b>transgender</b> <b>persons.</b> Recent contact with medical providers was observed, suggesting that medical providers could provide an important link to needed prevention, health, and social services...|$|R

25|$|The first ordained {{minister}} {{of a major}} religious sect in the U.S. or Canada to come out as gay was the UU Minister James Stoll in 1969.

25|$|A {{person may}} be {{considered}} to be a <b>transgender</b> <b>person</b> if their gender identity is inconsistent or not culturally associated with the sex they were assigned at birth, and consequently also with the gender role and social status that is typically associated with that sex. They may have, or may intend to establish, a new gender status that accords with their gender identity. Transsexual is generally considered a subset of transgender, but some transsexual people reject being labelled transgender.|$|E

25|$|With the {{legalisation}} {{of same-sex}} marriage in England and Wales, existing marriages will continue where {{one or both}} parties change their legal gender and both parties wish to remain married. However, civil partnerships continue where only both parties change their gender simultaneously and wish to remain in their civil partnership. This restriction remains as effectively it would legalise a small category of opposite-sex civil partnerships. The legislation also does not restore any of the marriages of transgender people that were forcibly annulled as a precondition for them securing a GRC and states that a GRC will not be issued unless the spouse of the <b>transgender</b> <b>person</b> has consented. If the spouse does not consent, the marriage must be terminated before a GRC may be issued.|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} of two {{articles}} on the law relating to <b>transgender</b> <b>persons</b> in Hong Kong. This article examines the current administrative and legal status of Hong Kong's <b>transgender</b> <b>persons.</b> It argues that, whilst various policies and practices adopted by the authorities undoubtedly facilitate the every day lives of certain <b>transgender</b> <b>persons,</b> the legal situation (which perpetually condemns them to their biological sex as designated at birth) is inhumane and should no longer be tolerated. The second article, Robyn Emerton, 'Time for Change: A Call for the Legal Recognition of Transsexual and Other <b>Transgender</b> <b>Persons</b> in Hong Kong', also intended for publication in the Hong Kong Law Journal, will consider how the current position could be challenged by way of judicial review under the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, or, ideally, changed through legislative reform. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

25|$|Two scandals {{were also}} hurting the department. The city {{was forced to}} pay $1.75 million to settle a lawsuit by {{the family of a}} <b>transgender</b> <b>person</b> after firefighters {{ridiculed}} the person rather than treating her after an automobile accident. The death led to allegations by D.C.'s large LGBT population that the department was plagued by widespread homophobia. As well, it came to light that D.C. fire department radio equipment did not work on the same frequencies as the Washington Metro, and for years firefighters' radios had not worked in subway tunnels. The public also learned that the fire department was encouraging wealthy, mostly white, citizens in upper Northwest to call the Bethesda-Chevy Chase Rescue Squad for emergency medical services instead of serving the area with its own ambulances (which took much longer to respond). Members of the D.C. City Council criticized this as giving wealthy residents better service than poor ones.|$|E
500|$|In a 2005 essay {{published}} in the online journal Flow, Shana Agid, a transgender student at Sarah Lawrence College, wondered whether programs like TransGeneration [...] "take away from other possibilities for change" [...] if—in {{an effort to make}} queer subject matter [...] "straight-friendly" [...] and [...] "consumable"—they only represent transgender people who fit a certain narrative and adhere to a gender binary. Like Agid, Todd Ramlow of PopMatters lamented the production's fixation on binary gender, but he found positive qualities in its presentation of some of the struggles and anxieties a <b>transgender</b> <b>person</b> might experience. [...] "It prods us to think seriously about transgender issues, and to… create more inclusive communities." [...] In his final analysis, he gave the series three stars out of ten.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Beautiful" [...] {{was directed by}} Jonas Åkerlund and premiered on December 9, 2002. It opens with Aguilera speaking the line [...] "Don't look at me", followed by scenes of her singing alone in a room intercut with self-image-related sequences of other people. An anorexic girl examines herself in a mirror, eventually punching through it; a thin teenage boy stands lifting weights in a room plastered with images of bodybuilders; and an African-American girl rips out pages of women's magazines including photos of only white women and throws them into a fire. In one sequence, a girl is physically bullied by several peers, and in another, a goth man sits {{at the back of}} a bus while several people get up and move. The video also touches on LGBT issues; one scene features a gay couple, portrayed by Jordan Shannon and Justin Croft, kissing on a bench and ignoring the stares of people who pass them. Another shows a <b>transgender</b> <b>person,</b> played by Robert Sherman, putting on makeup, a wig, and women's clothing. The music video debuted at number 2 on Total Request Live, spending a total of fifty days on the chart and retiring at number 6. It topped MuchMusic's Countdown for two consecutive weeks and remained on the countdown for fifteen weeks. The video received a Special Recognition award, presented by David LaChapelle, from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation at its 14th GLAAD Media Awards. After an a cappella performance of the song, Aguilera stated in her acceptance speech that [...] "this song is definitely a universal message that everybody can relate to– anyone that's been discriminated against or unaccepted, unappreciated or disrespected just because of who you are." ...|$|E

2500|$|These {{mental health}} facts are {{informed}} by {{a history of}} anti-LGBT bias in health care. [...] The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) listed homosexuality as a disorder until 1973; transgender status was listed as a disorder until 2012.

2500|$|Transgender-specific speech {{patterns}} that are gender non-specific include [...] "decoupl the specific corporeal characteristics of [...] from the masculinity [...] entailed by words like dick [...]" [...] Referring to genitals as a <b>transgender</b> <b>person</b> requires a {{suspension of the}} gendered reality of traditional Eurocentric anatomical standards; describing clitorises as 'cocks,' vaginas as 'front holes,' penises as 'girl dicks' or 'clits' both subverts societal expectations of the genitals themselves, and deconstructs the binarism of genital descriptions. This in turn helps normalize intersex experiences, as genital, reproductive, endocrine, and secondary sexual characteristics do not always follow binary, easily categorizable rules, and blurring the line between [...] "vagina" [...] and [...] "penis" [...] both allows transgender individuals to describe themselves more comfortably and validly and intersex individuals {{to make their own}} decisions about intersex surgery, or genital reconstructive surgery, as consenting adults and to be more visible and accepted in medical and social communities as non-conforming to binary sex descriptors.|$|E
