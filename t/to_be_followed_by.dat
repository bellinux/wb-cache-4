5|$|Some hymns narrate that Chinnamasta likes {{blood and}} thus is offered blood sacrifices at some shrines. The Shaktisamgama Tantra says that only brave souls (viras) should follow Vamamarga worship to the goddess. The Shakta Pramoda warns that {{improper}} worship brings severe consequences, with Chhinnamasta beheading the person and drinking his blood. Further, it explains the worship rituals <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> householders and those <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> renouncers. The Todala Tantra mentions that, as part of Chhinnamasta's worship, Shiva or his fierce form, Bhairava, be worshipped as Kabandha ("headless trunk") as the goddess's consort.|$|E

While the party was legitimized first and foremost by its defense of Flemish interests, its voters were mainly motivated by anti-immigration and anti-establishment protest.|$|E

5|$|Aram Avakian was {{initially}} selected {{to be the}} film's director, but when he continually refused to do a sentimental-type dog story, he was replaced by Leslie H. Martinson. Lillie Hayward and Roberta Hodes wrote the screenplay for the film, adapting several of the short stories from the novel to create a single narrative, and adding in an all-purpose villain. The film was released on June 6, 1962. The studio {{hoped it would be}} successful enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> a second film and a television series. Though praised by fans and modern reviewers, contemporary critiques felt Terhune's work did not translate well to film and it was considered a low budget, B-movie. It was released to home video in 1995.|$|E

5|$|But the Parthian Empire, {{weakened}} by internal strife and wars with Rome, was soon <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> the Sassanid Empire. Indeed, shortly afterward, Ardashir I, the local Iranian ruler of Persis (modern Fars Province, Iran) from Estakhr began subjugating the surrounding territories {{in defiance of}} Arsacid rule. He confronted Artabanus V at the Battle of Hormozdgān on 28 April 224AD, perhaps at a site near Isfahan, defeating him and establishing the Sassanid Empire. There is evidence, however, that suggests Vologases VI continued to mint coins at Seleucia as late as 228AD.|$|E
5|$|Cane toads pose {{a serious}} threat to native species when {{introduced}} to a new ecosystem. Classified as an invasive species in over 20 countries, there are multiple reports of the cane toad moving into a new area <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> a decline in the biodiversity in that region. The most documented region of the cane toad's invasion and subsequent effect on native species is Australia, where multiple surveys and observations of the toad's conquest have been completed. The best way to illustrate this effect is through the plight of the northern quoll, as well as Mertens' water monitor, a large lizard native to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Edgar was {{concerned}} about different interpretations of the Benedictine Rule in different monasteries in his kingdom, and wanted to impose uniform rules <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> all. The rules were {{set out in the}} key document of the English reform, the Regularis Concordia, which was adopted by the Council of Winchester in around 970. The Concordia was written by Æthelwold, who had sought advice from Ghent and Fleury Abbeys. A major aim of the Concordia was the regularisation of the form of church services, and Æthelwold tried to synthesise what he regarded as the best Continental and English practice.|$|E

The Padres lost the series three games to one. Young's 6–0 road {{performance}} in 2006 was one of 49 undefeated road seasons with at least five victories by a pitcher since post-season play began in 1903. However, {{it was the first}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> a postseason road victory.|$|E

5|$|In India, {{unaware of}} the delayed {{shipment}} and confident {{of being able to}} rally the Indian sepoy, the plot for the mutiny took its final shape. Under the plans, the 23rd Cavalry in Punjab was to seize weapons and kill their officers while on roll call on 21 February. This was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> mutiny in the 26th Punjab, which was to be the signal for the uprising to begin, resulting in an advance on Delhi and Lahore. The Bengal cell was to look for the Punjab Mail entering the Howrah Station the next day (which would have been cancelled if Punjab was seized) and was to strike immediately.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{administration}} of justice at village level was the responsibility of village assemblies, which usually consisted of the elders of the village. However, {{towards the end of}} the Anuradhapura Kingdom a group of ten villages, known as dasagam, was responsible for upholding justice in that area. The laws and legal measures <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> them were proclaimed by the king. Several rock inscriptions that record these proclamations have been found in archaeological excavations. Punishments differed from ruler to ruler. Some kings, such as Sanghabodhi (247–249) and Voharika Tissa (209–231) were lenient in this aspect, while rulers like Ilanaga (33–43) and Jetthatissa I (263–273) were harsher. However, crimes such as treason, murder and slaughter of cattle were generally punishable by death.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} Chōdō-in that Accession Audiences were held, {{the emperor}} was {{supposed}} to preside over early morning deliberations on major state affairs by the bureaucracy, receive monthly reports from officials, hold New Year Congratulations and receive foreign ambassadors.
