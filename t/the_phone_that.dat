5|$|Several {{more people}} are {{attacked}} and reduced to ash. A search of Eastern European employees leads them to Russian night nurse Tomas (Ravil Isyanov), but he is gone when they search his apartment. Despite being ordered to end the investigation and that the suspect is wanted by the Russian government and the CIA, Broyles tells Olivia (Anna Torv) to continue the case. Walter posits the entity needs radiation, and chooses its victims based on their exposure levels. They learn that Tomas stole his comatose brother, a former cosmonaut, and has been moving him around to both protect him and contain the entity. Fearing capture, Tomas removes his brother from the hospital; Walter speculates that the cosmonaut brought the entity back with him upon returning from space. Walter is finally able to solve the formula, and Broyles sadly tells Tomas over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>that</b> his brother and the entity cannot be separated. However, during their conversation, the entity escapes his brother's body and kills Tomas. The Fringe team is able to trace the call, and Broyles shoots the host (Tomas' brother) in the head to stop the entity from attacking another victim.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} <b>the</b> {{number of}} <b>phones</b> <b>that</b> can {{be supported by}} a packet-based multiplexing node, we study the MMBP/D/ 1 queuing model. Similar as in the circuit-switched case, where the Engset formula is used to determine <b>the</b> number of <b>phones</b> <b>that</b> can be supported by a switch, the fact <b>that</b> not all <b>phones</b> are active and talking {{all of the time}} can be exploited in the packet-based case. We investigate the impact of the link rate, the activity grade, the codec bit rate and the silence suppression factor on <b>the</b> number of <b>phones</b> <b>that</b> can be supported. We also compare <b>the</b> number of <b>phones</b> <b>that</b> can be supported by the node according to the MMBP/D/ 1 model with <b>the</b> number of <b>phones</b> <b>that</b> can be supported according to the M/D/ 1 model. If the activity grade of <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> is low, <b>the</b> M/D/ 1 model overestimates <b>the</b> number of <b>phones</b> <b>that</b> can be supported, even for high link rates. Only in the case where <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> are active all the time, the M/D/ 1 model gives accurate results. Reducing the codec bit rate yields a larger gain than expected because aggregating more sources of lower bit rate decreases the burstiness. Activating silence suppression on each phone normally results in the expected gain, because the additional burstiness introduced by silence suppression is negligible, if the activity grade of <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> is not too high. 1...|$|R

[...] As Lennon had initiated divorce proceedings, it prompted her to exclaim: [...] "Suing me for divorce? On what grounds is he suing me?" [...] When the news of Ono's pregnancy broke, Cynthia started her own divorce proceedings against Lennon on 22 August 1968. The financial settlement was hampered by Lennon's refusing to offer any more than £75,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., telling her on <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>that</b> the payment was akin to winning the football pools and that she was not worth any more.
