5|$|Further east, off the Whitby Road, is the Monks' Pond, the canons' fish pond. It {{presents}} a dramatic vista {{in which the}} priory arch is reflected and has often been photographed and painted. In 1908, the pond was <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elaborate water tableau organised by Lady Gisborough {{to raise funds for}} the restoration of St Nicholas' Church. The pond was home to a number of exceptionally large fish, but pollution in 2000 caused by a sewage leak led to the death of more than 5,000 fish.|$|E
5|$|Kroonland was <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{attempted}} murder-suicide in October 1908. Two acquaintances in steerage had {{an argument}} over a young female second-class passenger that both men knew. One man threw a knife at the other—only slightly wounding him—and then fled and jumped {{over the railing}} into the English Channel near Dover. U.S. Senator Benjamin Tillman {{and his wife were}} aboard the liner at the time and saw the young man jump overboard. Although the ship lowered a boat to look for him, no trace of him was found, and he was presumed drowned.|$|E
5|$|In New Zealand, Malone's {{death was}} widely {{reported}} and keenly felt, {{particularly in the}} Taranaki region. The soldiers of the Wellington Regiment held their former commander in high regard and paid {{for the construction of}} the Malone Memorial Gate, white marble gates at the entrance to King Edward Park in Stratford. The gate, one of New Zealand's largest war memorials that commemorates an individual soldier, was officially opened on 8 August 1923 in front of a large crowd. The gate is <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> annual ceremony held on 8 August to commemorate the memory of Malone. A fictionalised colonel based on Malone was a major character in a 1982 play written by Maurice Shadbolt, Once on Chunuk Bair, which told the story of the Wellington Battalion's battle of 8 August. In 1992, the play was filmed as Chunuk Bair. A plaque in his honour was unveiled in the New Zealand Parliament's Grand Hall in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in 2004 the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board {{conducted}} a study into the risks presented by dust explosions after three fatal accidents in the year before. The West Pharmaceutical Services explosion killed six persons, the CTA Acoustics fiberglass insulation manufacturing plant explosion killed seven, and the Hayes Lemmerz automotive parts plant explosion killed one, prompting the report. Their report showed that between 1980 and 2005, there had been 281 explosions involving combustible dust, resulting in 119 deaths and 718 injuries. The Board found that dust explosions posed a severe risk and {{made a number of}} recommendations to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. These had been partly implemented by 2008. The Board continued {{to be concerned about the}} potential for further fatal accidents up until Imperial's refinery was <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> explosion.|$|E
5|$|She, Charlie (Kirk Acevedo), and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) {{are called}} to <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{accident}} where a pedestrian has been {{run over by a}} bus, nearly duplicating events of a similar bus accident the day before, a statistical impossibility according to Astrid (Jasika Nicole). Olivia finds a ball-point pen at the scene, a rarity in the parallel universe because of the adoption of digital interfaces. Evidence suggests that the discovery of the pen by a bystander created a sequence of reactions that led to the victim's death. The next day, another pedestrian is wounded in a bus accident. As the Fringe team investigates the scene, finding another pen, a bystander is struck and killed by an ambulance. Olivia spots a suspicious man in the crowds, but he uses a seemingly random series of happenstance events to get away.|$|E
5|$|Ted Kennedy was 30 {{years old}} when he first entered the Senate {{following}} a November 1962 special election to fill the vacant seat previously held by his brother, John, who was now the President. He was elected to a full six-year term in 1964 and was later re-elected seven more times. The Chappaquiddick incident in 1969 resulted in the death of his automobile passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. Kennedy pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accident and later received a two-month suspended sentence. The incident and its aftermath hindered his chances of ever becoming President. His only attempt, in the 1980 election, resulted in a Democratic primary campaign loss to incumbent President Jimmy Carter, who later lost the general election to Republican candidate Ronald Reagan.|$|E

5|$|By 1779, Haider Ali had {{captured}} parts of modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala in the south, extending the Kingdom's area to about 80,000mi² (205,000km²). In 1780, he befriended the French and {{made peace with}} the Marathas and the Nizam. However, Haider Ali was betrayed by the Marathas and the Nizam, who made treaties with the British as well. In July 1779 Haider Ali headed an army of 80,000, mostly cavalry, descending through the passes of the Ghats amid burning villages, before laying siege to British forts in northern Arcot starting the Second Anglo-Mysore War. Haider Ali had some initial successes against the British notably at Pollilur, the worst defeat the British suffered in India until Chillianwala, and Arcot, until the arrival of Sir Eyre Coote, when {{the fortunes of the}} British began to change. On 1 June 1781 Sir Eyre Coote struck the first heavy blow against Haider Ali in the decisive Battle of Porto Novo. The battle was won by Sir Eyre Coote against odds of five to one, and is {{regarded as one of the}} greatest feats of the British in India. It was followed up by another hard-fought battle at Pollilur (<b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> earlier triumph of Haider Ali over a British force) on 27 August, in which the British won another success, and by the rout of the Mysore troops at Sholinghur a month later. Haider Ali died on 7 December 1782, even as fighting continued with the British. He was succeeded by his son Tipu Sultan who continued hostilities against the British by recapturing Baidanur and Mangalore.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Taylor {{started having}} {{troubles}} {{in his personal}} life again. On November 8, {{he was arrested in}} Miami-Dade County, Florida for leaving <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accident after striking another vehicle with his Cadillac Escalade. He had already committed the same offense in 1996 when he totaled his Lexus in a one-car accident and left the scene, saying he did not think the law required the reporting of a single driver incident. He was released on a $500 bond, and the other driver later sued him, seeking $15,000. He was arrested six months later for having sex with a 16-year-old girl at a Holiday Inn located in Montebello, New York. He was charged with felony third-degree statutory rape, for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone under 17. He was also charged with third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage girl $300 to have sex with him. The girl was represented by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred when Taylor pleaded guilty on March 22, 2011 and was sentenced to six years probation as part of a plea agreement, in which he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanors of sexual misconduct and patronizing a prostitute. He will also have to register as a low-risk level one sex offender. On October 26, 2012, a court rejected the victim's claims that Taylor assaulted her.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday February 24, 2007 {{at about}} 6:55a.m., Brown's Chevrolet Equinox {{was stolen from}} an on-street parking {{location}} by someone with key access and crashed into three parked vehicles before being abandoned {{a few blocks from}} the family home. Brown had driven his son to play in a basketball tournament in Jamestown, New York on Friday February 23. They returned home at approximately 10:30p.m. from the tournament. In interviews at the end of March 2007, Brown claimed that all members of his family with known key access had alibis. At the time Brown III possessed a learner's permit. Canisius College security cameras recorded parts of the accident, including the driver leaving the scene of multiple accidents. In April a second video recording with more fluid movement was revealed in contrast to the original recording of 36 frames per minute. In a news conference Brown announced that Byron Brown III took the senior Brown's car without permission and drove about the area near his house and Canisius College campus. Brown III admitted to the damage and was charged with driving without a driver's license and leaving the scenes of multiple accidents. Brown III was scheduled to appear on April 16, 2007 in Buffalo City Court on the charges. He pleaded guilty to unlicensed driving and leaving <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accident. In 2010, his son was charged with petit larceny for leaving a store with goods that were not paid for. Byron Jr. was spared a criminal conviction when a judge granted him a delayed dismissal on shoplifting charges, as recommended by prosecutors. Buffalo City Judge David M. Manz warned him and Xavier Jemison that they have to complete a four-hour shoplifting class and stay out of trouble for the next six months. He granted each an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal, meaning their petit larceny charges will be dismissed if they comply with his orders.|$|E
