Adsorption capacities of <b>thiophenic</b> <b>compounds</b> decrease significantly with the introduction of Qu, In, or water due to their strong competitive adsorptions over the coordinatively unsaturated Cu sites on Cu-BTC.

A fractional factorial design of experiments was employed to evaluate the effects and possible interactions of several process variables. Analysis of variance tests indicated {{that the number of}} extraction steps and the IL/gasoline volume ratio were of statistically highly significant, but none of the interactions were significant. The results showed that the desulfurization efficiency of the model gasoline by the ILs could reach 95.2  % under the optimal conditions.

The IL extraction was successfully applied as a complementary process to the adsorptive desulfurization with activated Raney nickel and acetonitrile solvent.

30|$|The {{removal of}} sulfur {{compounds}} from liquid fuels {{is carried out}} industrially via catalytic hydrodesulfurization (HDS), which converts sulfur compounds into H 2 S (and subsequently into elementary sulfur) and hydrocarbons at high temperature (350  °C) and pressure range of 35 – 270 bars [2]. This extraction takes place in two common extraction pathways. The first pathway is the direct removal of sulfur (hydrogenolysis) which occurs in linear sulfur compounds. The second extraction path is mainly for <b>thiophenic</b> <b>compounds</b> wherein the aromatic ring is hydrogenated first and then sulfur is removed [2].|$|R
30|$|The ionic liquids (ILs) {{have been}} {{recognized}} as promising alternatives to conventional non-desirable organic solvents and have received considerable attention as extractants for desulfurization of liquid fuels (Li et al. 2010; Mochizuki and Sugawara 2008; Kedra-Krolik et al. 2011; Hansmeier et al. 2011), {{or at least as}} a complementary technology to the HDS process (Nie et al. 2008). The ILs are environmentally friendly solvents with unique physicochemical properties, such as negligible vapor pressure, high chemical and thermal stabilities, nonflammability, and recyclability. These properties together with high affinity for sulfur-containing compounds, especially aromatic sulfur components, and immiscibility with fuels make ILs desirable extractants for desulfurization of liquid fuels (Wang et al. 2007; Kedra-Krolik et al. 2011). However, although ILs are highly effective for the extraction of some aromatic sulfur components, that is, they can lower the concentrations to desirable low levels (especially <b>thiophenic</b> <b>compounds),</b> they do not provide adequate efficiency for decreasing the total sulfur concentration to acceptable levels for many gasoline samples. Activated Raney nickel adsorbent combined with IL extraction is regarded as a promising strategy to achieve very low sulfur levels and is currently receiving increasing attention because it avoids the use of hydrogen and allows the process to be conducted at ambient conditions. This process is also appealing because the sulfur contaminants that are most resistant to HDS, such as <b>thiophenic</b> <b>compounds,</b> are the most reactive components under ambient conditions.|$|R

For this reason, biodesulfu-rization of <b>thiophenic</b> <b>compounds</b> has been studied exten-sively. However, studies on the sulfide compounds are scarce. In this paper, we describe desulfurization of a model sulfidic compound, dibenzyl sulfide (DBS) by an isolated Gordonia sp. IITR 100. The reaction was accom-panied with the formation of metabolites dibenzyl sulfox-ide, dibenzyl sulfone and benzoic acid. Studies with recombinant E. coli revealed that enzyme DszC of this isolate metabolizes DBS into dibenzyl sulfoxide and dibenzyl sulfone, but the reaction downstream to it is mediated by some enzyme other than its DszA. In reactions where DBS and dibenzothiophene (DBT) were present together, both IITR 100 and recombinant E. coli exhibited preference for the desulfurization of DBS over DBT. The newly identified capability of IITR 100 for desulfurization of both <b>thiophenic</b> and sulfidic <b>compounds</b> suggests its potential use in improved desulfurization of petroleum fractions...|$|R
30|$|In recent years, {{alkylation}} of thiophenic sulfur, {{invented by}} BP [6], also has attracted some attention. This process includes two steps: First, under {{the action of}} some acidic catalysts, the <b>thiophenic</b> sulfur <b>compounds</b> were alkylated with diene or olefins in the gasoline. Second, the alkylated heavy thiophenes are separated from gasoline by distillation. This technology could accept Euro IV and V gasoline standards and avoid the octane number loss in the desulfurization process [7]. Ke et al. [8] showed that <b>thiophenic</b> sulfur <b>compounds</b> react preferentially with diene rather than mono-olefins in the gasoline over a weak acidic catalyst under mild reaction condition. Meanwhile, the weak acidity reduced some side reactions during the alkylation process, such as polymerization of olefins and alkylation between olefins and aromatics.|$|R

So, the HDS-treated crude oil was selected for testing performance of the catalyst. By using EtOH, MeCN and DMF as extractants at optimum conditions, the conversion of S-compounds of 300  ppm HDS crude oil only reached 41  %, 38  % and 39  %, respectively (Fig.  6). Indeed, when crude oil was first desulfurized with HDS process, thiols, sulfides and disulfides were removed but aromatic S-compounds (<b>thiophenic</b> <b>compounds)</b> were remained in crude oil.

30|$|To {{achieve this}} goal, most sulfur-containing {{compounds}} are easily desulfurized by hydrodesulfurization (HDS), in which H 2 gas {{is used to}} remove the S-compounds through the formation of hydrocarbons and H 2 S.

Due to the high capital and operating costs of the HDS process due to factors such as reduced catalyst lifetime, higher hydrogen consumption, high temperature and pressure, oxidative desulfurization (ODS) is proposed as an appropriate substitute for the traditional HDS process and complementary method with ambient pressure, relatively low temperature, high selectivity and no consumption of hydrogen (Khenkin and Neumann 2011; Caero et al. 2005).

50|$|Within {{gasoline}} and diesel, the government requires sulfur levels {{to be reduced}} from 300 - 500 ppm to 30 ppm and 15 ppm respectively. For fuel cell applications sulfur must be under 1 ppm to avoid poisoning the fuel cell. Cu(I) Y zeolite catalyst is typically used to reduce the sulfur in both situations. The hydrodesulfurization technique can remove thiols and sulfides, but cannot efficiently remove thiophenes, therefore the catalyst is used because it selectively adsorbs the sulfur compounds at ambient temperature and pressure. They selectively bind to the <b>thiophenic</b> <b>compounds</b> by pi complexation. The pi complexation involves the donation of electron charges from the thiophene pi-orbital to the vacant s orbital of the copper. At the same time, the d-orbitals of the metals donate electron charges to the anti-bonding pi-orbital. This donation to the s orbital of copper is important in adsorbing thiophene. The downfall of using the Cu(I) Y zeolite catalyst for desulfurization is that moisture exhibits strong inhibiting effects on the adsorption process because the water molecule is preferred over sulfur.|$|R

The type of IL was not significant and showed the least effect estimate. At the optimized conditions, the extraction process was applied to the desulfurization of several real gasoline samples. The results indicated that the ionic liquid provides a high tendency to extract some aromatic constituents such as <b>thiophenic</b> <b>compounds</b> in both model and real gasoline samples. Due to the inability of the ionic liquid to lower total sulfur compounds in real gasoline samples to a desirable level, an IL extraction was applied as a complementary process to the ADS, which was performed by activated Raney nickel adsorbent and acetonitrile solvent. The sulfur content of the samples after treatment with the combined desulfurization scheme presented a considerable reduction and reached to > 71  % for all of the samples. The results indicated that the ADS + IL extraction provides high efficiency and selectivity and can be regarded as a promising energy efficient desulfurization strategy for the production of low-sulfur gasoline. It is expected that the desulfurization efficiency can be further improved by optimizing the ADS operating parameters, such as reaction temperature, reaction time, and the amount and proportion of reactants, to obtain ultra-low-sulfur gasoline.|$|R

SCD is a sulfur specific detector that allowed detailed analysis of the reactions that occur during SCW treatment of real fuel mixtures. It was shown that SCW treatment had two effects on sulfur compounds: cracking of heavy sulfur compounds into smaller compounds, mainly benzothiophenes (BT) and dibenziophenes (DBT), and cracking of long alkyl chains on these BTs and DBTs causing a shift to lower molecular weight BTs and DBTs. SCW was found to be ineffective in breaking the stable aromatic rings of these <b>thiophenic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Work in this thesis shed light into molecular level reactions during SCW treatment rather than changes in bulk properties which are often reported in work in the field of SCW desulfurization. by Yuko Kida.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} development of new analytical techniques to characterize shale oil, with emphasis on the heteroorganic compounds. ^ A class separation precedure using preparative liquid chromatography on an amino-bonded silica support was developed to allow separation of shale oil into four chemical classes, namely: (1) hydrocarbons (alkanes/alkenes), (2) polynuclear aromatics, (3) acids and neutral polars, and (4) bases. This procedure was applied to the analysis of two different types of shale oil, Tosco II and In-Situ. All four classes of compounds were then characterized by capillary gas chromatography with flame ionization detection and some were also examined with the thermionic nitrogen specific detector. The acids and bases were further characterized by capillary gas chromatography with interfaced mass spectroscopy. Comparison of the two oils showed that although the level of heteroorganic compounds is different, the distribution of compounds within the same class is very similar. ^ An argentation liquid chromatographic procedure was developed for isolation of the <b>thiophenic</b> <b>compounds</b> in shale oil. This is an important class of compounds to study since it encompasses approximately 80 % of the organic sulfur content. Existing methods for isolation of thiophenes depend on a chemical reaction step. These methods fail to maintain the integrity of the thiophenes due either to discrimination dependent on the alkyl substituents present or to chemical alteration of some of the compounds. The argentation procedure avoided this discrimination since the retention time on the liquid chromatographic column was almost independent of the number and type of alkyl substituents on the thiophene ring. From direct comparison with the existing chemical methods, the argentation procedure was shown to be superior in recovering the thiophenes without discrimination. ...|$|R
40|$|Rhodococcus erythropolis I- 19, {{containing}} multiple {{copies of}} key dsz genes, {{was used to}} desulfurize alkylated dibenzothiophenes (Cx-DBTs) found in a hydrodesulfurized middle-distillate petroleum (MD 1850). Initial desulfurization rates of dibenzothiophene (DBT) and MD 1850 by I- 19 were 5. 0 and 2. 5 μmol g dry cell weight− 1 min− 1, more than 25 -fold higher than that for wild-type bacteria. According to sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analysis, <b>thiophenic</b> <b>compounds</b> accounted for > 95 % of the total sulfur found in MD 1850, predominantly Cx-DBTs and alkylated benzothiophenes. Extensive biodesulfurization resulted in a 67 % reduction of total sulfur from 1, 850 to 615 ppm S. XANES analysis of the 615 -ppm material gave a sulfur distribution of 75 % thiophenes, 11 % sulfides, 2 % sulfoxides, and 12 % sulfones. I- 19 preferentially desulfurized DBT and C 1 -DBTs, followed by the more highly alkylated Cx-DBTs. Shifting zero- to first-order (first-order) desulfurization rate kinetics were observed when MD 1850 was diluted with hexadecane. Apparent saturation rate constant (K 0) and half-saturation rate constant (K 1) values were calculated to be 2. 8 μmol g dry cell weight− 1 min− 1 and 130 ppm, respectively. However, partial biocatalytic reduction of MD 1850 sulfur concentration followed by determination of initial rates with fresh biocatalyst led to a sigmoidal kinetic behavior. A competitive-substrate model suggested that the apparent K 1 values for each group of Cx-DBTs increased with increasing alkylation. Overall desulfurization rate kinetics with I- 19 were affected by the concentration and distribution of Cx-DBTs according to the number and/or lengths of alkyl groups attached to the basic ring structure...|$|R
30|$|Benzenesulfonic acid as a {{catalyst}} for the thiophene alkylation with 2, 5 -dimethyl- 1, 5 -hexadiene was studied and its reaction condition was optimized. As expected, benzenesulfonic acid demonstrated good catalytic performance. The mono- and di-alkyl-thiophene was confirmed by GC–MS. The order of the alkylation performance of the <b>thiophenic</b> sulfur <b>compounds</b> with 2, 5 -dimethyl- 1, 5 -hexadiene was obtained over benzenesulfonic acid was as follows: 3 -methyl-thiophene ≈ 2 -methyl-thiophene >Thiophene > 2, 5 -dimethyl-thiophene > 2 -methyl- 5 -ethyl-thiophene. The optimal reaction condition was that temperature was 85  °C, catalyst/feed weight ratio was 10  % and time is 80  min. Under the optimized condition, the conversion was nearly 73  %. The catalyst had some recycle-use performance. The catalytic activity could be maintained by addition of the fresh catalyst periodically and quantitatively.|$|R
40|$|Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) unit {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} conversion processes used in petroleum refineries. Nowadays, petroleum refineries, and specifically FCC units, have to be improved. New technologies must be developed to increase the refineries revenues as well to comply with environmental regulations. One area of significant concern is the necessary in-situ FCC gasoline sulfur reduction. In this respect, this PhD dissertation proposes a new Zn-Offretite (Zn-OFF) additive for gasoline sulfur reduction via selective adsorption in FCC units. The PhD research developed covers the preparation of the Zn-OFF zeolites and their physicochemical characterization. This physicochemical characterization leads to the demonstration that zinc species are most likely included in the OFF framework. Furthermore, it is also shown that the Zn in the OFF zeolites, may considerably increase acidity as well as the abundance of Lewis acid sites. As a result, it is found that the Zn in the OFF is tailored for thiophenic species selective adsorption. Regarding the Zn-OFF performance, it is proven in this PhD dissertation, that the Zn-OFF additive displays an excellent performance for 2 -methylthiophene (2 MTh) selective adsorption. The best sulfur removal was found using the Zn(3. 5 wt%) -OFF additive and 2 MTh at 530 °C and 5 s. On the basis of the results obtained, it is anticipated that the Zn(3. 5 wt%) -OFF additive can provide a valuable in-situ sulfur selective adsorption for the <b>thiophenic</b> <b>compounds.</b> It is also established that the used Zn(3. 5 wt%) -OFF additive, when blended with a FCC commercial catalyst reduces both coke production and sulfur in coke. It is thus, demonstrated that under typical FCC unit operating conditions, the Zn(3. 5 wt%) -OFF additive can selectively adsorb sulfur contained species. This additive can also decrease sulfur in coke with this leading to a mitigation of SOx emissions in the FCC regenerator, where coke is combusted and catalyst reactivated...|$|R
30|$|The {{commonly}} used catalysts are the sulfide Co–Mo/Al 2 O 3 or Ni–Mo/Al 2 O 3 catalysts [11]. It {{has been shown}} that substituted dibenzothiophene (DBT) species are less reactive {{because of the presence of}} the methyl groups that create steric hindrance during the interaction of sulfur with catalysts’ active sites [12]. It has also been shown that the reactivity of the aromatics decreases with the substituent’s addition to the DBT structure [12]. The HDS process faces several challenges i.e., (i) its inability to achieve ultra-deep desulfurization level (< 10  ppm) due to the fact that the refractory <b>thiophenic</b> sulfur <b>compounds</b> remain in the treated stream [16], (ii) the catalysts used need to be replaced more frequently due to deactivation and loss of activities [22], iii) the similar boiling point range of diesel and sulfur compounds make the separation process challenging. The boiling point of diesel is in the range of 163 – 357  °C which is very close to that of the refractory sulfur compounds.|$|R
40|$|Characterization of {{petroleum}} cuts constitutes a necessary stage to perfect {{understanding of the}} reaction mechanisms and to {{the description of the}} kinetics of certain refining processes such as hydrotreating or catalytic cracking. Mass spectrometry (MS), thanks to group-type quantitative analysis methods, enables to access detailed description of complex hydrocarbon mixtures such as middle distillates or heavy cuts such as vacuum distillates. But these methods are also subject to some drawbacks and we shall expose, thereunder, two examples of improvements. In a first part, the accuracy of MS quantification of <b>thiophenic</b> sulphured <b>compounds</b> in middle distillates is studied by intertechnique comparison with the results obtained by gas phase chromatography coupled to sulphur-specific detection by chemiluminescence (GC/SCD). Improving on the MS method is suggested. In the second part, a new system for introducing the sample in the spectrometer source, dedicated to group-type analysis of heavy cuts is described. Its validation, by comparison of the MS results to those of liquid chromatography (LC) as well as its performances, is exposed...|$|R
40|$|Strains DBVPG 6662 and DBVPG 6739 of Rhodosporidium toruloides, a {{basidiomycete}} yeast, grew on thiosulfate as a sulfur {{source and}} glucose (2 g liter− 1 or 10. 75 mM) as a carbon source. DBVPG 6662 has a defective sulfate transport system, whereas DBVPG 6739 barely grew on sulfate. They were compared for {{the ability to}} use dibenzothiophene (DBT) and related organic sulfur compounds as sulfur sources. In the presence of glucose as a carbon source and DBT as a sulfur source, strain DBVPG 6662 grew better than DBVPG 6739. In the presence of thiosulfate as a sulfur source, the two yeast strains did not use DBT, DBT-sulfone, benzenesulfonic acid, biphenyl, and fluorene. When the two strains were grown in the presence of glucose, strain DBVPG 6662 transformed 27 % of the DBT present (10 μM) at a rate of 0. 023 μmol liter− 1 h− 1 in 36 h. Traces of 2, 2 ′-dihydroxylated biphenyl were transiently accumulated under these conditions. When the same strain was grown on glucose {{in the presence of a}} higher concentration of DBT (0. 5 g liter− 1), mainly in an insoluble form, the whole surface of the DBT crystals was colonized by a thick mycelium. This adherent structure was imaged by confocal microscopy with fluorescent concanavalin A, a lectin that specifically binds glucose and mannose residues. When DBVPG 6662 was grown on glucose in the presence of a commercial emulsion of bitumen, i. e., orimulsion, 68 % of the benzo- and dibenzothiophenes and DBTs was removed after 15 days of incubation. The fungus adhered by hyphae to orimulsion droplets. When cultivated in the presence of commercial emulsifier-free fuel oil containing alkylated benzothiophenes and DBTs and having a composition similar to that of orimulsion, strain DBVPG 6662 removed only 11 % of the total organic sulfur that occurs in the medium and did not adhere to the oil droplets. These results indicate that strain DBVPG 6662 is able to utilize the organic sulfur of DBT and a large variety of <b>thiophenic</b> <b>compounds</b> that occur extensively in commercial fuel oils by physically adhering to the organic sulfur source...|$|R
