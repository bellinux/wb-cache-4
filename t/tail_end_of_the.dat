5|$|Through {{the first}} months of 1918, the {{composition}} of Battleship Division Nine changed to reflect the lessons learned from operating in a war zone with the Grand Fleet. It soon became apparent that with only four ships, the division could not maintain the level of preparedness required by the constant need to be ready to sail at limited notice. The inevitable result was machinery breakdowns that reduced the squadron to three ships, a development considered unacceptable given the Division's important position at the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle line. The British—faced with the same problem—responded by allocating a spare battleship to each of their squadrons. In this way, each squadron always remained at full strength even when a ship was being repaired.|$|E

5|$|Despite its {{radical and}} unusual shape, the {{airframe}} was built along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy. The airframe was broken down {{into a number of}} major assemblies: the centre section, a rectangular box containing the bomb-bay and engine bays bounded by the front and rear spars and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre fuselage; the front fuselage, incorporating the pressure cabin; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing trailing edge and <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage; the wings were not sealed and used directly as fuel tankage, but carried bladders for fuel in the void spaces of the wings; and there was a single swept tail fin with a single rudder on the trailing edge.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, a new fastest lap of the track ever at 1:36.006. However, he also came under investigation of the stewards as he failed to obliged the rules set for turn 2, rejoining the track earlier than allowed after running wide. After being summoned to the stewards at the end of qualifying, he walked away with a reprimand, but was not penalised. Behind Rosberg in second place, the two Ferrari cars of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen were third and fourth respectively. At the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field, three pairs of cars were eliminated: both Sauber, Manor and Renault drivers missed Q2.|$|E
5|$|These {{events are}} at the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long GRB {{duration}} distribution, lasting more than 10,000 seconds. They have been proposed to form a separate class, caused {{by the collapse of}} a blue supergiant star, a tidal disruption event or a new-born magnetar. Only a small number have been identified to date, their primary characteristic being their gamma ray emission duration. The most studied ultra-long events include GRB 101225A and GRB 111209A. The low detection rate may be a result of low sensitivity of current detectors to long-duration events, rather than a reflection of their true frequency. A 2013 study, on the other hand, shows that the existing evidence for a separate ultra-long GRB population with a new type of progenitor is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength observations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion.|$|E
50|$|With the Class 16A, Hendrie {{experimented with}} four-cylinder simple {{expansion}} (simplex) steam power. All four cylinders were arranged in line below the smokebox. The Walschaerts valve gear had rocker arms attached to <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer piston valves which {{passed through the}} frames and then actuated the adjacent inner piston's valves. It operated in the simplex configuration, whereby steam is fed directly to all four cylinders and spent steam is exhausted by all cylinders directly through the smokebox and up the chimney.|$|R
50|$|SPAs {{have not}} been shown to {{directly}} modify DNA or have activity other than direct blocking of other factors or processes. However, modifying agents can be bound to <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hairpin structure. <b>The</b> specific binding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SPA to DNA allows for site-specific targeting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conjugated modifying agent. SPAs have been paired with the DNA-alkylating moieties cyclopropylpyrroloindole and chlorambucil that were able to damage and crosslink SV40 DNA. This effect inhibited cell cycling and growth. Chlorambucil, a chemotherapeutic agent, was more effective when conjugated to an SPA than without.|$|R
5000|$|Express trains (also {{sometimes}} referred to as fast trains, though this is a relative term, usually meaning [...] "faster than some other trains on the line in question") are a form of rail service. Express trains make {{only a small number of}} stops, instead of stopping locally. In some cases, trains run express where there is overlapping local train service available, and run local at <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line, where there is no supplemental local service. During overnight hours, or other times where it is practical, express trains may become local, but still running to where an express train would terminate.|$|R
5|$|In general appearance, {{the current}} {{operating}} line of SIR looks somewhat like an outdoor {{line of the}} New York City Subway. Since the 1960s, it has been grade separated from all roads, but it runs more or less at street level for a brief stretch north of Clifton, between the Grasmere and Old Town stations, and from south of the Pleasant Plains station to Tottenville, {{the end of the}} line. It uses NYC Transit-standard 600 V DC third rail power. Its equipment are R44 subway type cars that are specially modified with headlight dimmers, electric windshield defrosters, FRA Compliant cab signals and horns, and FRA regulation 223 required shatterproof glazing, and exterior mounted grab rails near the side doors. The cars were built in early 1973, at the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> R44 order of subway cars for New York City Transit (the Staten Island R44s being the last cars built by the St. Louis Car Company). Heavy maintenance of the equipment is performed at NYCT's Clifton Shops. Any work that cannot be performed at Clifton requires the cars to be trucked over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the subway's Coney Island Complex shops in Brooklyn. The right-of-way also includes elevated, embankment and open-cut portions, and a tunnel near St. George.|$|E
5|$|In {{what was}} Moss's first {{pre-season}} as coach, he {{did little to}} change what Arnold had built at the club. The only {{major changes in the}} side were with the addition of Senegalese international Malick Mané and Hungarian Richárd Vernes, and Marcos Flores leaving the club, with Mile Sterjovski retiring. Mariners began the season on a high, progressing to the semi-finals of the 2014 FFA Cup and defeating local rivals Newcastle Jets 1–0 at home in the opening round of the A-League. However the season soon turned with the team failing to secure a win {{for the remainder of the}} year. After their elimination from the 2015 AFC Champions League qualifying play-off by Chinese side Guangzhou R and a continued poor league record after a short mid-season break, the club stood down Moss as head coach. The decision was made on 6 March 2015, with Mariners appointing technical director Tony Walmsley in an interim capacity and captain John Hutchinson in a dual player-coach role, until the end of the season. Portuguese player Fábio Ferreira also joined the team at the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season. On 15 April Walmsley was announced as Mariners' permanent technical director and head coach for the 2015–16 season. The announcement came despite an end to the season in which the club finished the league in eighth position.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{running in}} {{practice}} and a wet qualifying session meant that teams had to improvise their strategies at the Hockenheimring. Fernando Alonso controlled much of the race from pole position, only relinquishing the lead when he pitted, {{and he went on}} to take his third victory of the season. Lewis Hamilton's one hundredth Grand Prix started with a disaster when he picked up a puncture on the third lap and spent most of the race at the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field before retiring on lap 56 with a suspension problem. Confusion briefly reigned when Hamilton, in seventeenth place at the time, began lapping faster than the leaders and sought to unlap himself. Sebastian Vettel later claimed that this was a ploy by McLaren to force both him and Alonso to drive defensively against Hamilton, slowing them down enough to allow team-mate Jenson Button to leap-frog them at the second round of stops; Vettel lost a position to Button, but Alonso was unaffected, as Ferrari pitted him before Hamilton could interfere with his race. Button briefly {{looked as if he had}} the pace to pass Alonso for the race lead, but the race was deadlocked in the final twenty laps, and Button began to fade in the final five laps of the race. The race was marked by another technical dispute regarding Red Bull Racing, who were referred to the stewards by FIA Technical Delegate Jo Bauer for what he felt was an illegal engine map in use on the Red Bull RB8. The stewards elected to take no action against Red Bull, stating that the team had not violated any of the technical regulations, but noted that they did not accept all of the arguments presented by the team when asked to explain. The stewards were less forgiving of Vettel, who ran wide at the hairpin while trying to pass Button and could only complete the pass outside the limits of the circuit. Vettel had twenty seconds added to his race time as a penalty, demoting him to fifth overall. With Button promoted to second, Kimi Räikkönen inherited third place and Kamui Kobayashi was classified a career-best fourth.|$|E

50|$|Some helmets {{retain a}} {{symbolic}} ribbon at the back, which dates from mounted hunting. Traditionally, black ribbon {{was used for}} fox hunting or general hunting, with red ribbon used when stag hunting or arme blanche hunting. The ribbon was “sewn up” (i.e. with a bow at <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helmet and <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ribbon either cut off or glued pointing upwards on <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helmet) for “common” riders. The ribbon was “sewn down” (i.e. with the <b>tail</b> <b>ends</b> dangling from the bow, below <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helmet) for hunt masters and hunt staff. Because any rider is entitled to wear a sewn up black ribbon, this is the standard for modern helmets retaining the ribbon. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> “sewn down” ribbons by those not entitled to them sometimes occurs in the United States but is considered a serious transgression by traditionalists.|$|R

40|$|Because of {{contributions}} due to reflection, <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turbulence refractive index structure constant may be affected. For pure scattering from turbulence in the inertial subrange, the radar echo {{power can be}} used to calculate the refractive index structure constant.

The tilted antenna also may be pick up reflected components from near the zenith through the sidelobes. This can be tested by <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> correlation function. This method applies a time domain filtering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intensity time series but needs a very careful selection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high pass filters...|$|R
