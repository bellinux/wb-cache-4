2500|$|Avicenna generalizes youth {{as having}} a [...] "hot" [...] temperament, but {{comments}} that there is controversy over which periods of youth are hotter. The general notion that youth are [...] "hot" [...] in temperament is due to youth's supposed relationship {{to members of the}} body that are hot. For example, blood was considered [...] "hot" [...] as was mentioned earlier, therefore youth is assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hot</b> partially due to blood being more [...] "plentiful" [...] and [...] "thicker", according to Avicenna. Evidence for youth having an excess of blood is suggested by Avicenna's observation that nose bleeds are more frequent within youth. Other contributing factors are the youth's association with sperm and the consistency of their bile. Further description of youth in regards to heat and moisture is given with respect to sex, geographical location, and occupation. The Canon says, for example, that females are colder and more moist.|$|E

2500|$|Summer daytime {{temperatures}} in the Southwestern Interior <b>are</b> the <b>hottest</b> in Canada. During July and August, the average daily maximum temperature around Osoyoos and Spences Bridge is over 29°C (84.2°F), though Lillooet and Lytton erroneously claim <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hotter</b> and vie {{for the title of}} [...] "Canada's <b>Hot</b> Spot". This <b>is</b> because their summertime temperature extremes tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hotter</b> than Osoyoos and Spences Bridge (despite a slightly cooler average temperature). This heat combined with little precipitation means that arid animals and vegetation thrive. Although winter temperatures are much colder than Coastal British Columbia, this area is still milder than almost anywhere else in Canada. Southern Interior valleys, including the Okanagan Valley, are spared the incessant precipitation found on the coast, but they receive some of the lowest amounts of bright sunshine in Canada during the winter months. This is a result of winter temperature inversions that leave the valleys in a layer of thick cloud {{while the rest of the}} province basks in sunshine.|$|R
