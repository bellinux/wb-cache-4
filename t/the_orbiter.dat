5|$|STS-125 {{was first}} {{assigned}} to Discovery with a launch date no earlier than May 2008. This originally moved the mission ahead of STS-119, ISS Assembly flight 15. Delays to several shuttle missions {{resulted in a}} change in mission ordering, and <b>the</b> <b>orbiter</b> was changed to Atlantis on 8 January 2007. The crew of Atlantis went to the Kennedy Space Center for the Crew Equipment Interface Test in early July 2008. This allowed the STS-125 crew to get familiar with <b>the</b> <b>orbiter</b> and the hardware they would be using during the flight.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>orbiter</b> {{carried the}} Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI) pallet in its forward payload bay; this had {{previously}} flown on Columbia to carry test equipment. The pallet was not outfitted with any flight instrumentation, but {{was used to}} mount two experiments. The first studied the interaction of ambient atomic oxygen with the structural materials of <b>the</b> <b>orbiter</b> and payload, while the second tested {{the performance of a}} heat pipe designed for use in the heat rejection systems of future spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>orbiter</b> carried two EMUs {{for use in}} case of an {{emergency}} spacewalk; if needed, they would be used by Truly and Gardner.|$|E
40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{measure the}} orientation error of the ARID end-frame {{as well as}} linear displacements in <b>the</b> <b>Orbiter's</b> y- and z-axes. In each experiment {{the position of the}} ARID on the trolley is fixed and the manipulator extends and retracts along <b>the</b> <b>Orbiter's</b> y-axis. A sensor platform consisting of four sonars arranged in a '+' pattern measures the platform pitch about <b>the</b> <b>Orbiter's</b> y-axis (angle b) and yaw about <b>the</b> <b>Orbiter's</b> x-axis (angle alpha). Corroborating measurements of the yaw error were performed using a carpenter's level to keep the platform perpendicular to the gravity vector at each ARID pose being measured...|$|R
50|$|While all of <b>the</b> <b>orbiters</b> were {{externally}} practically identical, {{they had}} minor {{differences in their}} interiors. New equipment for <b>the</b> <b>Orbiters</b> was installed {{in the same order}} that they underwent maintenance work, and <b>the</b> newer <b>orbiters</b> were constructed by Rockwell International, under NASA supervision, with some more advanced, lighter in weight, structural elements. Thus, <b>the</b> newer <b>orbiters</b> (Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour) had slightly more cargo capacity than Columbia or Challenger.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Viking <b>Orbiters</b> {{discovered}} {{much about}} water on Mars. Branched streams, studied by <b>the</b> <b>Orbiters</b> in <b>the</b> southern hemisphere, suggested that rain once fell.|$|R
5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five inches of <b>the</b> <b>Orbiter</b> Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on <b>the</b> <b>Orbiter</b> Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|During the post-launch news conference, NASA {{managers}} {{said the}} initial early {{review of the}} launch video showed no obvious debris events, but a thorough analysis would be performed to ensure <b>the</b> <b>orbiter</b> sustained no significant damage during ascent.|$|E
5|$|One of two {{missions}} {{considered for}} the 2003 Mars launch window, the MRO proposal lost against {{what became known as}} the Mars Exploration Rovers. <b>The</b> <b>orbiter</b> mission was rescheduled for launch in 2005, and NASA announced its final name, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, on October 26, 2000.|$|E

5|$|The Spaceflight Meteorology Group at Johnson Space Center was {{predicting}} {{less than}} favorable weather for Friday's landing, so managers asked {{the crew to}} power down some non-critical systems to help conserve power, {{in the event that}} <b>the</b> <b>orbiter</b> is not able to land until Saturday.|$|E
5|$|The crew of Atlantis had six {{possible}} landing opportunities on Saturday. Managers {{evaluated the}} best three opportunities {{of the day}} to try bring <b>the</b> <b>orbiter</b> home. Saturday's first landing opportunity at Kennedy Space Center was waived due to poor weather forecasts, and observed weather violations for the landing criteria. After further evaluating weather patterns around Florida, managers on the ground chose to waive the second opportunity as well, and wait one more day to attempt to get <b>the</b> <b>orbiter</b> into Florida on Sunday. Weather in California had excellent forecasts, so if the attempts on Sunday to land in Florida were not successful, the shuttle would be able to land at Edwards Air Force Base without weather being an issue.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>orbiter</b> {{continued}} to experience recurring problems in 2009, including four spontaneous resets, {{culminating in a}} four-month shut-down of the spacecraft from August to December. While engineers have not determined {{the cause of the}} recurrent resets, they have created new software to help troubleshoot the problem should it recur.|$|E

40|$|Two Viking orbiters are {{currently}} in Mars orbit. In the nearly two years since they were launched, <b>the</b> <b>orbiters</b> have successfully performed many functions including transportation of the Viking landers to Mars. <b>The</b> <b>orbiters</b> have for <b>the</b> last year provided relay links for lander-earth communications, and they have carried out from orbit their own scientific exploration of the planet. Crucial {{to the success of}} <b>the</b> <b>orbiters</b> has been <b>the</b> performance of the on-board attitude control system, which has provided <b>the</b> required <b>orbiter</b> stabilization and orientation throughout the missions. A comprehensive spacecraft and attitude control system dynamic analysis was necessary to certify the control system before launch and to evaluate its flight performance. This paper contains an outline of the analysis and of some of its results...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{experiments}} were to be performed inside <b>the</b> <b>orbiter</b> crew compartment. Among these was the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System, being flown for the fourth time. This separated solutions of biological materials by passing electric fields through them; the experiment aimed at supporting research into diabetes treatments. A small animal cage was flown containing six rats; no animal experiment was carried out on the flight, but a student involvement project was planned for a later mission which would use the cage, and NASA wanted to ensure it was flight-tested. The student involvement project carried out on STS-8 involved William Thornton using biofeedback techniques, to try {{to determine if they}} worked in microgravity. A photography experiment would attempt to study the spectrum of a luminous atmospheric glow which had been reported around <b>the</b> <b>orbiter,</b> and determine how this interacted with firings of the reaction control system.|$|E
5|$|After each flight {{the engines}} would {{be removed from}} <b>the</b> <b>orbiter</b> and {{transferred}} to the Space Shuttle Main Engine Processing Facility (SSMEPF), {{where they would be}} inspected and refurbished in preparation for reuse on a subsequent flight. A total of 46 reusable RS-25 engines, each costing around US$40 million, were flown during the Space Shuttle program, with each new or overhauled engine entering the flight inventory requiring flight qualification on one of the test stands at Stennis Space Center prior to flight.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) was a {{partially}} developed fission-powered spacecraft with ion thrusters that was cancelled in 2006. It {{was part of}} Project Prometheus. The Europa Lander Mission proposed a small nuclear-powered Europa lander for JIMO. It would travel with <b>the</b> <b>orbiter,</b> which would also function as a communication relay to Earth.|$|E

50|$|The SCAs {{were used}} to ferry Space Shuttles from landing sites back to the Shuttle Landing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center. <b>The</b> <b>orbiters</b> were placed {{on top of the}} SCAs by Mate-Demate Devices, large gantry-like {{structures}} that hoisted <b>the</b> <b>orbiters</b> off <b>the</b> ground for post-flight servicing then mated them with the SCAs for ferry flights.|$|R
5|$|On 22 August 2008, after a delay {{following}} Tropical Storm Fay, Atlantis was rolled from <b>the</b> <b>Orbiter</b> Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building, {{where it}} was mated to the external fuel tank and solid rocket booster stack. Problems were encountered during the mating process, and poor weather due to Hurricane Hanna caused a delay in the rollout of Atlantis to the launch pad, which is normally done seven days after rollover.|$|E
5|$|Preparation for {{the mission}} began on June 3, with the {{assembly}} of the shuttle's solid rocket boosters (SRB) on the Mobile Launcher Platform. The boosters were stacked on June 20, 1983, and the external tank mated to the assembly on June 23. Challenger arrived at Kennedy Space Center on June 29, and was transferred to <b>the</b> <b>Orbiter</b> Processing Facility on June 30. After post-flight maintenance and preparation for the new mission, including the installation of most flight payloads, the shuttle {{was transferred to the}} Vehicle Assembly Building on July 27, and mated to the booster/tank stack. The stack was checked out on July 29 and 30, and moved to Launch Complex 39A on August 2, 1983. INSAT-1B was loaded into <b>the</b> <b>orbiter</b> when on the pad; the overall processing time from Challenger arriving at KSC to being ready for launch was only sixty-two days, a record for the program at the time.|$|E
5|$|Preparation of Atlantis {{itself for}} mission STS-74 {{began with the}} {{replacement}} of three thrusters in Atlantiss right-hand Orbital Maneuvering System pod in bay 2 of <b>the</b> <b>Orbiter</b> Processing Facility on 25 August 1995. Installation of the three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) on Atlantis was completed on 5 September 1995, as were closeout operations on the Russian docking module.|$|E

5|$|The crew's {{preparation}} for the mission had begun some thirteen months earlier in 1994, with the crew being trained {{in the operation of}} the space shuttle, the mating and docking procedures that would be required as Atlantis approached Mir later in the mission, and the management of the various scientific experiments being carried on <b>the</b> <b>orbiter</b> during the mission.|$|E
5|$|The day's {{schedule}} {{also included}} the installation and {{alignment of the}} centerline camera in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>Orbiter</b> Docking System. The camera later assisted Commander Ken Cameron in final piloting tasks as Atlantis moved towards and docked with Mir. At 5:00am CST (11:00UTC) on day 2, Atlantis was about 4,000statute miles behind Mir, and was closing in {{to the space station}} {{at a rate of about}} 380statute miles per orbit.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} also {{scheduled}} {{to carry out}} a series of tests with the TDRS-1 satellite which had been deployed by STS-6, to ensure the system was fully operational before it was used to support the Spacelab 1 program on the upcoming STS-9 flight. <b>The</b> <b>orbiter</b> furthermore carried equipment to allow for encrypted transmissions, to be tested for use in future classified missions.|$|E
