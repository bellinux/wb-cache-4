25|$|The shelters {{are made}} from aluminum, steel, and glass. Air {{ventilation}} works through fins on the aluminum part of the shelters. Floors {{are made from}} <b>tread</b> <b>plate,</b> although newer shelters now use concrete. The shelters are equipped with platform screen doors. Some of the connecting elevated bridge ramps have gentle slopes (with some exceptions) to accommodate the disabled. One disadvantage {{of some of the}} ramps is that passengers need to walk a relatively long way up the ramps and then double back to reach the boarding shelters. The floors of the bridge are mostly tread plates although some are made from concrete. One problem with the <b>tread</b> <b>plate</b> is that considerable noise is generated by the movement of passengers across the <b>tread</b> <b>plate</b> surfaces. Another problem {{is that some of the}} <b>tread</b> <b>plate</b> surfaces can become very slippery during the rainy season. There are no sanitary facilities in most of the shelters.|$|E
50|$|Diamond plate, {{also known}} as checker plate, <b>tread</b> <b>plate</b> and Durbar floor plate, {{is a type of}} metal stock with a regular pattern of raised {{diamonds}} or lines on one side, with the reverse side being featureless.

40|$|A {{study of}} tyre inner trim {{as a method}} for {{reducing}} tyre cavity resonance noise is presented. The tyre is modelled as a rectangular toroid where only the outside shell is flexible. A modal series solution of the sound pressure frequency response inside the tyre cavity {{is derived from the}} wave equation using modal superposition. In the solution with the rigid and flexible wall boundary condition, the effect of placing a trim layer onto the inner surface of the tyre <b>tread</b> <b>plate</b> wall is reflected by adding a damping loss term in the sound pressure frequency response function. The numerical simulation result was then compared with the result obtained from a roving impact test performed on a tyre. The results show that selective trim material may be effective for reducing the structure-borne noise magnitude resulting from the tyre cavity resonance...|$|E

5000|$|The {{entrance}} to the system was like a very wide escalator, with broad metal <b>tread</b> <b>plates</b> of a parallelogram shape. After a short distance the <b>tread</b> <b>plates</b> were accelerated to one side, sliding past one another to form progressively into a narrower but faster-moving track which travelled at almost a right angle to the entry section. The passenger was accelerated through a parabolic path to a maximum design speed of [...] km/h ( [...] mph). The experience was unfamiliar to passengers, who needed {{to understand how to}} use the system {{to be able to do}} so safely. Developing a moving hand-rail for the system presented a challenge, also solved by the Battelle team. The Speedaway was intended to be used as a stand-alone system over short distances or to form acceleration and deceleration units providing entry and exit means for a parallel conventional (but fast-running) Starglide walkway which covered longer distances. The system was still in development in 1975 but never went into commercial production.|$|R
