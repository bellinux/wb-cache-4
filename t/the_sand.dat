5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the video, soil crumbles down, as Björk appears, buried to her waist in <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> wearing a golden dress (by Michael van der Ham), a brooch on her shoulder designed by the singer herself and a blue wig, holding a rock. As she starts singing, she divides the rock into two pieces. As she waves the pieces, <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> around her stirs. She then lays the two pieces on <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> and they become part of two rock sprites, that come out of <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> and start writhing around Björk, while strata emerges from them. In {{the end of the first}} verse, the strata of the two rocky sprites try to unite, as Björk grabs <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> and let it slips out from her fingers. During the second verse other rocks emerge from <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> and revolve around Björk, who dances in <b>the</b> <b>sand.</b> Other rocky sprites spring out of the new rocks and link to the main two, which are still spinning around the singer's head. The two parts are irresistibly attracted to each other and try to unite as they are stroked by Björk. The strata of the rocks morph to form a face, similar to that of the singer. As the chorus begins, Björk disappears in the darkness. The two rocky parts, now united, start to bestir themselves, whilst various rocks on <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> start to erupt. Lava, magma, smoke and fire storm while Björk's face appears in the lava. Every rock erupts noisily, causing a rain of volcanic ash.|$|E

25|$|By {{the events}} of , seven years after <b>The</b> <b>Sands</b> of Time, he has become callous and {{depressed}} due to being deprived of proper food and sleep by the Dahaka's pursuit. He decides {{to travel to the}} island where <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> of Time were found and prevent their creation. Travelling to the time when <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> were created, he encounters Kaileena, the Empress of Time who was created by the gods and is destined to create <b>the</b> <b>Sands.</b> <b>The</b> Prince kills Kaileena, but he unknowingly creates <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> in doing so. Using an artifact called the Mask of the Wraith, the Prince travels back in time and forces Kaileena into his time, hoping to kill her there and create <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> while saving himself. In the game's canon ending, the Prince obtains a magical sword and uses to kill the Dakaha when it attacks Kaileena after he brings her to his time. In The Two Thrones, the Prince returns to Babylon with Kaileena and finds that his actions in Warrior Within undid the death of the Vizier. The Vizier kills Kaileena, absorbing <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> and turning into a god-like monster. The Prince is also partially infected by <b>the</b> <b>Sands,</b> which turns him into a Sand Monster hybrid and helps manifests an alternate Dark Prince personality. During his adventure, he reunites with Farah and struggles against his Dark Prince persona. Upon finding his father's body, the Prince decides to accept the consequences of his actions, gaining control over his Dark Prince self. He kills the Vizier and frees Kaileena's spirit, who purges <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> from him and leaves with <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> for another world. When the Dark Prince makes a final attack, Farah helps the Prince finally overcome his dark self.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{attempts}} to dismantle or tow the stern to sea failed, the State of Oregon still intended {{to see the}} remainder of the vessel removed from the beach. In 2006, the state's lawsuit against the ship's owners was settled, clearing the legal obstacles that prevented removal and providing the funds necessary to finance the project. Removal plans were {{complicated by the fact that}} the stern had become deeply embedded in <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> in the seven years since the wreck, with some portions of the stern estimated to be 2030feet (69m) below <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> line.|$|E

Such products are emitted both from <b>the</b> <b>sands</b> of I generation, meaning sands bound by bentonite, especially those containing carbon forming additives, as well as from <b>the</b> <b>sands</b> of II generation, meaning <b>the</b> <b>sands</b> with <b>the</b> binding materials or even <b>the</b> <b>sands</b> without any binders, such as the forms produced by using the LOST FOAM technology. The literature often refers to the negative effects of nitrogen emitted from <b>the</b> <b>sands</b> with <b>the</b> urea resins on the tendency to create surface defects.

5|$|Barchans or {{crescent}} dunes {{are produced}} by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the slip face point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to the angle of repose of <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the angle of repose, <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> avalanches, which is a nonlinear behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then {{the addition of a}} further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche. Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like solitary waves.|$|E

5|$|The game follows {{an unnamed}} Prince whose father sacks a Maharaja's {{city at the}} {{instigation}} of its treacherous Vizier. During the attack, the Prince obtains an artifact called the Dagger of Time, while his army captures an hourglass containing <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> of Time. Visiting Azad to present <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> {{as a gift to}} the city's ruler, the Vizier tricks the Prince into releasing <b>the</b> <b>Sands,</b> transforming <b>the</b> city's population into savage monsters. Together with the Maharaja's daughter Farah, the Prince works to correct his mistake and return <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> to <b>the</b> hourglass. The gameplay revolves around the Prince's platforming abilities, broken up by fights with the creatures created by <b>the</b> <b>Sands.</b> A key mechanic in the game is using the Dagger to rewind time if the Prince makes a mistake platforming, and using it to kill and freeze enemies.|$|R

5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass have an {{important}} function in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass help to bind <b>the</b> <b>sand.</b> Sea holly, sand sedge, bird's-foot trefoil and pyramidal orchid are other specialists of this arid habitat. Some specialised mosses and lichens are found on the dunes, and help to consolidate the sand; a survey in September 2009 found 41 lichen species. The plant distribution {{is influenced by the}} dunes' age as well as their moisture content, the deposits becoming less alkaline as calcium carbonate from animal shells is leached out of <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> to be replaced by more acidic humus from plant decomposition products. Marram grass is particularly discouraged by the change in acidity. A similar pattern is seen with mosses and lichens, with the various areas of the dunes containing different species according to the acidity of <b>the</b> <b>sand.</b> At least four moss species have been identified as important in dune stabilization, since they help to consolidate <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> add nutrients as they decompose, and pave the way for more exacting plant species. The moss and lichen flora of Blakeney Point differs markedly from that of lime-rich dunes on the western coasts of the UK. Non-native tree lupins have become established near the Lifeboat House, where they now grow wild.|$|E

5|$|Like all flounders, Peacock flounders, Bothus mancus, have {{excellent}} adaptive camouflage. They use cryptic coloration {{to avoid being}} detected by both prey and predators. Whenever possible rather than swim, they crawl on their fins along the bottom while constantly changing colours and patterns to match their background. In a study, some flounders demonstrated the ability to change pattern in eight seconds. They were able to match the pattern of checkerboards that they were placed on. Changing pattern is an extremely complex process involving the flounder's vision and hormones. If one of the fish's eyes is damaged, or covered by <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> the flounder has difficulties in matching its pattern to its surroundings. Whenever the fish is hunting or hiding from predators, it buries itself into <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> leaving only the eyes protruding.|$|E
