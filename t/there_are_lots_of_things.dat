So <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that need to be done addressing those kinds of cultural issues also.|$|E

Vocalist Brandon Boyd noted, [...] "It's not that we were burned out being in a band or being in this band; I think that we, collectively, were feeling like if we didn't step away from this monster that we created then it would begin to consume us. [...] We had to plant some roots, lest we start to write songs about living on a tour bus. So we had to fall in love, we had to fall out of love, we had to make homes." [...] Guitarist Michael Einziger elaborated further, [...] "It just got to this point where we had been going strong for such {{a long period of time}} that we really accomplished all of our goals. [...] It was like, 'Ok, well what do we do now?' Obviously <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> to do but I think we wanted to take some time, each of us personally, to explore a little bit and find out what the rest of the world was like."
