5|$|Kauri gum {{formed when}} resin from kauri trees leaked out through {{fractures}} or {{cracks in the}} bark, hardening with the exposure to air. Lumps commonly fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> became covered with soil and forest litter, eventually fossilising. Other lumps formed as branches forked or trees were damaged, which released the resin.|$|E

5|$|The melampittas are insectivores, {{although}} {{in the case of}} the greater melampitta, this statement is inference as their diet isn't described. All that is known is that it sticks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> understory. The lesser melampitta feeds on insects as well as worms, snails, small frogs and even small fruit. It forages on the ground, probing through leaves by flipping them with its bill.|$|E
5|$|According to {{generally}} accepted standards of respect, the national flag {{should never be}} dipped to any person or thing.

The flag should never be flown dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, it should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate the colors and then, burning.|$|E

Another threat to the birds is from humans; many nests are trampled on (even by the occasional bird watcher) during breeding season because the nests are hidden close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> therefore difficult for passers-by to spot.|$|E
5|$|After Peach's castle is {{sent back}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> Mario defeats Bowser, he recounts his tale to Luigi, who had {{remained}} at home while Mario {{went on the}} adventure.

5|$|Ale were {{believed}} {{to be able to make}} men insane; in eastern Serbia there is a special term for such a man: alosan. When people encountered an ala on a road or field, they could get dangerous diseases from her. Ale are also responsible for dogsâ€™ rabies, although indirectly: a skylark that reaches the clouds and encounters an ala there goes mad (alosan), plunges <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>and</b> so kills itself; a dog that finds and eats the bird goes mad too.|$|E

5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from the road, and the huge windows in the hall, reaching down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E

Buhmaid was taken to Salmaniya hospital where attempts to revive him failed over the course of three days. He died on the afternoon of 21 February.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{patterns}} of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The three body scatter spike is an example. This {{is the result}} of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground, where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar. The energy took more time to go from the hail <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> back, as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the radar, and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.|$|E
