40|$|The {{safety of}} {{vulnerable}} road users at traffic intersections is critical. Driver assistance systems can improve safety but {{have to rely}} on accurate detection of hazardous situations. Given the complexity of pedestrian movement, detection of pedestrian presence and prediction of their behaviour are not always without error. Drivers' attitude towards such errors is an important issue for the effectiveness of the system. An online questionnaire survey has been carried out to investigate drivers' acceptance of the system under different reliability and accuracy configurations. The results show that safety <b>warnings</b> <b>of</b> pedestrians are generally found to be useful, although false positives and false negatives tend to reduce its pleasantness. The system is found to be most useful for right turn movement at a busy intersection, compared to through movements and quiet intersections.

Roson argued that this had made evacuation impossible in the limited time available. For their part, ETA-pm accused the authorities of not acting on the warnings, in order to discredit the organisation.|$|R

The HMI design has been demonstrated at the Helmond test site. Experts have evaluated two applications (intersection and a lane-change application). The acceptance was rated positive for both systems, the trust in the systems was rated as adequate and the visual and acoustic warnings were rated as fairly easy to understand. In addition, the tactile and haptic warnings were rated as easier to understand compared to the visual/acoustic warnings.

40|$|A Driver's Warning Assistant(DWA) {{differs from}} an {{automatic}} co-pilot by only presenting warning {{messages to the}} driver,instead of acting upon the vehicle or the environment. It {{is an open question}} whether combinations of both types of assistance system are feasible with automatic intervention if the driver has been warned without success, or if there is no chance for a warninq message leading to an appropriate action by the driver in due time. In this case difficult questions of task allocation and of responsibility have to be answered. The evaluation has begun and will continue with DWAs dedicated to special driving tasks, e. g. parking, lane keeping, overtaking, crossing. These DWAs have a competence limited to one of the driver's tasks, so that the driver can only expect support for this single task. In a car equipped with such a specialized DWA the driver has to learn the limits of the DWA's competence. Additionally, the case has to be considered in which a specialized DWA has limit ed competence for its task. This means that the support of a driver by the DWA is limited to a subset of all possible situations (e. g. to situations with good sight conditions). Under certain circumstances (e. g. hidden obstacles) the driver might not be supported. It has to be clarified whether this can be learned and will be accepted by the driver. A crucial topic {{in the development of a}} DWA is the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> messages for the driver. The moment <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> on the one hand has to be chosen early enough to enable the driver to react appropriately. This means that the inevitable reaction time, which the driver needs to receive and process the DWA's message and to prepare a reaction, has to be considered. On the other hand the warning message should not be presented too early as this would annoy the driver and result in poor acceptance of the DWA. Therefore, it is important to integrate a time-budget analysis in the development phase and in the run-time version of a DWA, leading t...|$|R
40|$|Taking the antidepressant, nomifensine, {{this article}} focuses on the {{discovery}} and management of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) manifested in doctors' spontaneous post-marketing reports. Company-friendly experts, free-lancer research scientists, public servant physicians and regulatory scientists are shown to have made distinct contributions to ADR discovery.

Qualitative and quantitative interpretative standards of what counted as ADR discovery affected regulatory warning systems and decisions about when to withdraw a drug from the market.

40|$|Do {{politicians}} {{appeal to}} fear, and if so, {{how does the}} public respond to potentially fear-inducing messages? I reason that changes in the political environment necessitate entrepreneurial efforts if politicians hope to maximize positive attention. Scholarship indicates that presidents can often shape press coverage or move public opinion, particularly {{in the domain of}} foreign policy or during national crises. In this dissertation I conceptualize government-issued terrorism warnings as a type of fear appeal. Specifically, I examine the relationship between changes in aggregate presidential approval and the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> terrorism <b>warnings</b> over the two and one-half years after the 9 / 11 attacks, and whether warnings were related to changes in the overall tone of news coverage for the Bush administration and select policies. On balance, the evidence suggests that strategic considerations informed the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> terrorism <b>warnings</b> as presidential approval was negatively associated with publicly disseminated terrorism warnings, and the tone of coverage tended to become more positive following each alert. ^ I then use experimental methods to examine patterns of individual-level responses to mediated messages about terrorism. Drawing insights from the fear appeals literature and political science research, I reason that cognitive (threat perceptions and confidence in government) and affective (fear and anger) responses to news coverage about terrorism-related threats should relate to policy preferences and presidential approval. Further, because terrorist threats target the national group, I consider how one 2 ̆ 7 s sense of identification with the American people relates to cognitive and affective responses. The experimental results are mixed as cognitive and affective responses relate to policy attitudes in meaningful ways, but are unrelated to presidential approval, and national identity is largely unrelated to the outcomes of interest. In sum, this dissertation contributes to a more robust understanding of the types of strategic considerations salient at the elite level as politicians strive to maintain approval. Moreover, it extends our understanding of how people respond to terrorism-related messages by moving beyond 9 / 11 specifically. This study provides valuable insights for future research seeking to examine the use of emotional appeals in the political realm. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} European {{research}} project SAFESPOT is to prevent road accidents by developing a Safety Margin Assistant that extends the drivers´ awareness in space and time. One application of the Safety Margin Assistant is the Intelligent coopeRative Intersection Safety system (IRIS). IRIS will identify safety critical situations at intersections and generate warning messages to support road users. This paper addresses the interaction of IRIS with the driver. In order to gain knowledge about the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>warning</b> messages, a driving simulator experiment was performed before implementing and testing the application in a real-life environment. The objective of the experiment was to gain insight in the time <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> {{and the way to}} warn. The examined IRIS scenarios where a normal or police car that violates the red light and a warning for a conflict with a scooter when turning right. The time <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> and the approaching velocities of the red-light violating cars were varied in the study. The study showed that the safety margin increased when the driver was warned for a red-light violator and a possible conflict with a scooter. The earliest moment <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> for the red-light violating cars was preferred when these cars both drove 30 km/h. Two moments <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> have been compared. Furthermore, the study showed perceived differences between the police car and the normal car: a normal car violating the red light was perceived as more dangerous than a police car when both drove 60 km/h, and the perceived warning time for the police car came later than for the normal car when they both drove 30 km/h. Participants indicated that they had a look at the display in 74 % of the critical situations, and indicated that they understood the icon a little.

40|$|Flooding {{and flash}} floods that cause {{significant}} {{economic and social}} damage have been widely studied {{in the last few}} decades. The European Commission Flood Directive 2007 / 60 Flood Risk Management Plans require the assessment of potential damage to give an appreciation of the magnitude of the consequences of a flood event and so help stakeholders to use a cost benefit approach to planning flood mitigation measures. This paper evaluates the direct tangible flood damage applying the JRC water depth-damage functions for the European territory to estimate the potential economic damage. Intangible damage is evaluated with the Life Safety Model (LSM) to study the dynamic interactions among people, vehicles, buildings and the flood wave. LSM assesses potential flood damage and allows the development of a Flood Evacuation Plan in case of an emergency, underlining the evacuation routes adopted by people and vehicles. This enables emergency managers to avoid evacuation bottleneck problems and identify areas of potential high mortality. The impact of changes such as road network improvements, the location of safe havens and <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> flood <b>warnings</b> can be assessed in terms of potential loss of life.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Aura {{is a brief}} {{subjective}} symptom {{that may}} represent the initial manifestation of a partial epileptic seizure with objective signs or constitute the entire epileptic attack (focal sensory seizure (FSS)). We studied the electro-clinical features of FSSs recorded in 28 patients. Methods: Using long-term surface video-EEG recordings, we examined 28 patients (from a consecutive series of 64) with stereotyped FSSs and complex partial seizures (CPS) preceded {{in at least one}} instance by identical subjective manifestations (overall 255 FSSs and 39 CPS were recorded). FSSs were subdivided according to the type of sensation into somatosensory, visual or oculosensory, viscerosensory, experiential, cephalic and diffuse warm sensations. The EEG discharges accompanying FSSs were examined by two of the authors either blinded as to the type and <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the seizure, or unblinded, i. e. after receiving complete clinical information including <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the patient’s <b>warning.</b> Results: The ictal pattern accompanying FSSs was identified blind in 13 patients and unblind in 8 patients. In seven patients, the ictal discharge remained undetected. In the cases with recognizable ictal abnormalities, two main patterns could be distinguished, static and dynamic. FSSs whose ictal discharge could be recognized by blind EEG examination more frequently consisted of somatosensory and visual or oculosensory manifestations, and the discharge generally involved the centro-parieto-occipital regions. The ictal discharge of viscerosensory and experiential FSSs more easily remained undetected; when identified, it generally involved the fronto-temporal regions. Conclusions: FSSs are often accompanied by ictal abnormalities recognizable on surface EEG.

Thirty-six participants, twelve each in one of three age groups, participated in the study. A visual <b>warning</b> system capable <b>of</b> providing four different <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> was installed on a continuous mining machine that is used to mine coal. The speed of detecting various machine movements was recorded with and without the visual warning system. The average speed of detection for forward and reverse machine movements was reduced by 75 % when using the flashing <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> the visual <b>warning</b> system. This translated to 0. 485 m of machine travel for the fast speed condition of 19. 8 m/min, which is significant {{in the context of the}} confined spaces of a mine.

40|$|Anthrax is endemic {{throughout}} Africa, causing considerable {{livestock and}} wildlife losses and severe, sometimes fatal, infection in humans. Predicting {{the risk of}} infection is therefore important for public health, wildlife conservation and livestock economies. However, because of the intermittent and variable nature of anthrax outbreaks, associated environmental and climatic conditions, and diversity of species affected, the ecology of this multihost pathogen is poorly understood. We explored records of anthrax from the Serengeti ecosystem in north-west Tanzania where the disease has been documented in humans, domestic animals {{and a range of}} wildlife. Using spatial and temporal case-detection and seroprevalence data from wild and domestic animals, we investigated spatial, environmental, climatic and species-specific associations in exposure and disease. Anthrax was detected annually in numerous species, but large outbreaks were spatially localized, mostly affecting a few focal herbivores. Soil alkalinity and cumulative weather extremes were identified as useful spatial and temporal predictors of exposure and infection risk, and for triggering the onset of large outbreaks. Interacting ecological and behavioural factors, specifically functional groups and spatiotemporal overlap, helped to explain the variable patterns of infection and exposure among species. Synthesis and applications. Our results shed light on ecological drivers of anthrax infection and suggest that soil alkalinity and prolonged droughts or rains are useful predictors of disease occurrence that could guide risk-based surveillance. These insights should inform strategies for managing anthrax including prophylactic livestock vaccination, <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> public health <b>warnings</b> and antibiotic provision in high-risk areas. However, this research highlights the need for greater surveillance (environmental, serological and case-detection-orientated) to determine the mechanisms underlying anthrax dynamics. </p...|$|R
40|$|YesOver {{the past}} few decades, {{the number of women}} having their first babies over the age of thirty-five in most {{developed}} societies has steadily increased. Concerns have been raised over this trend amidst <b>warnings</b> <b>of</b> both the increased risk of fertility problems and health risks to mother and child. Despite this, research into the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy in the context of decreasing fertility has been somewhat neglected, with research typically framed in biomedical rather than social terms. However, this area merits closer attention given the contradictory nature of societal messages that simultaneously encourage women to pursue careers and enhance lifestyle, whilst <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> ‘risks’ of infertility and problems in ‘delaying’ motherhood. This article is based on a small-scale qualitative study that uses data drawn from eleven in-depth interviews with ‘older mothers’ about their transition to motherhood.

40|$|Comparing {{the safety}} of {{prescription}} drugs over time is difficult due to the paucity of reliable quantitative measures of drug safety. Both the academic literature and popular press have focused on drug withdrawals {{as a proxy for}} breakdowns in the drug safety system. This metric, however, is problematic because withdrawals are rare events, and they may be influenced by factors beyond a drug's safety profile. In the current paper, we propose a new measure: the incidence and <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> Black Box <b>Warnings</b> (BBWs). BBWs are warnings placed on prescription drug labels when a drug is determined to carry a significant risk of a serious or life-threatening adverse event. Using a unique data set, one that includes all new molecular entities (NMEs) submitted to the FDA between May 1981 and February 2006, and subsequently approved and marketed, we analyze the <b>timing</b> and incidence <b>of</b> BBWs. Our analyses also use data on several drug characteristics likely to affect the probability a new drug will receive a BBW. We draw several conclusions from our analyses. For example, drugs receiving priority FDA review {{are more likely to have}} BBWs at the time of approval than NMEs receiving standard review. We also find that early prescription volume and orphan drug status are associated with an increased likelihood of receiving a BBW. We do not, however, find a significant difference in the rate of BBWs across time cohorts. A comparison of NMEs approved before and after the 1992 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), which authorized the payment of user fees from drug manufacturers to the FDA in an effort to expedite new drug application (NDAs) review times, did not reveal a statistically significant difference in the rate of BBWs. Critics of PDUFA maintain that reduced FDA-approval times under PDUFA have compromised drug safety. We do not find empirical support for this contention. ...|$|R

The surge models for the RDSPS and RESPS have grid spacings of 1 / 30 ° and 1 / 12 ° respectively. The models are driven by surface air pressure and 10 m winds generated by operational global deterministic and ensemble prediction systems that are run operationally by the Canadian Meteorological Centre. Surge forecasts are evaluated for the period 1 March, 2013 to 31 March 2014. Based on traditional statistics (e. g., standard deviation {{of the difference between}} observations and predictions) both systems are shown to have skill in forecasting surges six days into the future.
