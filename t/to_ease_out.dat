50|$|The book {{details the}} {{everyday}} life of Mildred Lathbury, a spinster {{in her thirties}} in 1950s England. Perpetually self-deprecating, but with the sharpest wit, Mildred keeps busy with near-romances (her own and those of others), church jumble sales, {{and of course the}} ubiquitous cup of tea. Mildred's life grows more exciting with the arrival of new neighbours, anthropologist Helena Napier and her handsome, dashing husband, Rocky - with whom Mildred fancies herself in love. Through the Napiers, she meets another anthropologist, Everard Bone, and it is with him that Mildred will eventually form a relationship. A sub-plot revolves around the activities of the local vicar, Julian Malory, who becomes engaged to a glamorous widow, Allegra Gray. Allegra proceeds <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>out</b> Julian's sister, Winifred, a close friend of Mildred's. Eventually matters come to a head and Allegra leaves the vicarage after a quarrel. In the meantime, Helena, who has been on the verge of leaving Rocky for Everard, accepts that Everard does not care for her and leaves the neighbourhood, along with Rocky.|$|E

50|$|For {{some years}} from 1315 the king made {{persistent}} efforts to equip his faithful servant Northburgh with further ecclesiastical benefices {{to provide a}} steady income {{in keeping with his}} status. Initially he tried to place Northburgh in canonries with lucrative prebends at various cathedrals. On 11 June 1315 the king granted him the predend of Wistow in the Archdiocese of York. This was already the subject of a succession battle that had gone on for two years. The king was forced to make the grant again on 10 December, allowing Northburgh <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>out</b> John Nassington, the victor of the earlier struggle, in the following year. On 26 July 1315 the king granted Northburgh the prebend of Farndon-cum-Balderton in the Diocese of Lincoln. This attempt proved unsuccessful as the prebend was already occupied by an absentee Italian cleric. However the grant of the prebend of Stoke, also in Lincoln Diocese, on 1 November 1315 proved more fruitful. The incumbent, possibly the same Italian cleric, proved vulnerable here, as the prebend had been declared vacant during the reign of Edward I, and he was canonically removed by bishop on 29 July 1316.|$|E

We characterize a Malthusian corner regime which is characterized by strong gender inequality in education and high fertility. We find both in theory and in the data that reducing the social and institutional gender gap does not help to escape from this regime while reducing the wage gender gap lowers fertility only in countries which have already escaped from it. The key policies <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>out</b> {{the countries in the}} Malthusian regime are to promote mother’s longevity and to curb infant mortality.

40|$|Multipath routing {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} preferred over single path routing to provide parallel fail safe paths and to maximize throughput.

Towards this, <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>out</b> congestion and improve network resource utilization we devise a load balancing strategy that splits the load among multiple paths according to link quality.

30|$|Adopting an {{inductive}} theory building approach through {{qualitative research}} methodology {{of data collection}} and analysis spread across six months, followed by inter-rater reliability testing using quantitative technique, this empirical study researches the meaning of the ‘social enterprise’ construct in the Indian context, and develops a conceptual framework that represents the construct. This sets an orientation needed for aspiring social entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurship researchers <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>out</b> their understanding of the ‘social entrepreneurship’ phenomenon within the boundaries of an Indian context. The contested nature of the phenomenon in discourses across the globe is largely due to local/regional/national variations in practice. ‘Market Orientation’, ‘Social Value Creation’, ‘Social Entrepreneur’, and ‘Balanced Impact’ emerged as key constructs comprising Indian social enterprises. The principle philosophical paradigms for this theory construction are Social Constructionism and Interpretivism, which give impetus to reflective and analytical thought trials for extracting the conceptual framework interwoven in textual data. The study sets course for further research to refine the vocabulary list, identify conceptual densities, create scales for statistical inquiries, and enable further inclusiveness of the conceptual framework.|$|E
