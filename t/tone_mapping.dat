25|$|<b>Tone</b> <b>mapping</b> {{reduces the}} dynamic range, or {{contrast}} ratio, {{of an entire}} image while retaining localized contrast. Although it is a distinct operation, <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> is often applied to HDRI files by the same software package.|$|E
25|$|An {{even more}} {{sophisticated}} group of <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> algorithms {{is based on}} contrast or gradient domain methods, which are 'local'. Such operators concentrate on preserving contrast between neighboring regions rather than absolute value, an approach motivated {{by the fact that}} the human perception is most sensitive to contrast in images rather than absolute intensities. Those <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> methods usually produce very sharp images, which preserve very well small contrast details; however, this is often done at the cost of flattening an overall image contrast, and may as a side effect produce halo-like glows around dark objects. Examples of such <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> methods include: gradient domain high dynamic range compression and A Perceptual Framework for Contrast Processing of High Dynamic Range Images (a <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> is one of the applications of this framework).|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of color photography, <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> in the {{darkroom}} was no longer possible due to the specific timing needed during the developing process of color film. Photographers looked to film manufacturers to design new film stocks with improved response, or continued to shoot {{in black and white}} to use <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> methods.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn Power Line Networks, a link {{adaptation}} {{is realized}} by combining Multi-Carrier modulations techniques and bit-loading algorithms, {{resulting in the}} creation of <b>tone</b> <b>maps.</b> A <b>tone</b> <b>map</b> defines, for each subcarrier on a particular transmission path, the appropriate constellation that has to be applied based on a link quality criterion. Now, a frequently encountered situation happens when one station is requested to forward simultaneously multiple services to several stations of the network. Considering the fact that current PLC networks only work in a Time Division Multiplexing mode, the transmission efficiency in a point-to-multipoint scenario is not optimal. In this paper, we present a novel and practical algorithm, called TMSA (<b>Tone</b> <b>Maps</b> Splitting Algorithm), meant to split already defined point-to-point <b>tone</b> <b>maps.</b> It results in the definition of a Frequency Division Multiplexing mode to handle point-to-multipoint transmissions, efficiently exploiting the frequency diversity naturally present in the <b>tone</b> <b>maps.</b> Note that the proposed solution could work with other technologies, as long as quasi-static channels can be assumed and bit-loading algorithms are used...|$|R

25|$|Forms of <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> long precede digital photography. The {{manipulation}} {{of film and}} development process to render high contrast scenes, especially those shot in bright sunlight, on printing paper with a relatively low dynamic range, is effectively a form of <b>tone</b> <b>mapping,</b> {{although it is not}} usually called that. Local adjustment of tonality in film processing is primarily done via dodging and burning, and is particularly advocated by and associated with Ansel Adams, as described in his book The Print; see also his Zone System.|$|E
25|$|The normal {{process of}} {{exposure}} compensation, brightening shadows and altering contrast applied globally to digital images {{as part of}} a professional or serious amateur workflow is also a form of <b>tone</b> <b>mapping.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Tone</b> <b>mapping</b> is a {{technique}} used in image processing and computer graphics to map one set of colors to another to approximate the appearance of high-dynamic-range images in a medium that has a more limited dynamic range. Print-outs, CRT or LCD monitors, and projectors all have a limited dynamic range that is inadequate to reproduce {{the full range of}} light intensities present in natural scenes. <b>Tone</b> <b>mapping</b> addresses the problem of strong contrast reduction from the scene radiance to the displayable range while preserving the image details and color appearance important to appreciate the original scene content.|$|E
25|$|For this method, {{models for}} the Human Visual System (HVS) and the display are first generated, along with a simple <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> operator. The {{contrast}} distortions are weighted according to their individual visibilities approximated by the HVS. With these models, an objective function that defines the tone curve can be created and solved using a fast quadratic solver.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} local <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> is used {{even though the}} dynamic range of the source image could be {{captured}} on the target media, either to produce the distinctive appearance of a locally tone mapped image, or to produce an image closer to the photographer's artistic vision of the scene by removing sharp contrasts, which often look unattractive. In some cases, tone mapped images are produced from a single exposure which is then manipulated with conventional processing tools to produce the inputs to the HDR image generation process. This avoids the artifacts that can appear when different exposures are combined, due to moving objects in the scene or camera shake. However, when <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> is applied to a single exposure in this way, the intermediate image has only normal dynamic range, {{and the amount of}} shadow or highlight detail that can be rendered is only that which was captured in the original exposure.|$|E

25|$|Modern HDR imaging uses a {{completely}} different approach, based on making a high-dynamic-range luminance or light map using only global image operations (across the entire image), and then <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> the result. Global HDR was first introduced in 1993 resulting in a mathematical theory of differently exposed pictures of the same subject matter that was published in 1995 by Steve Mann and Rosalind Picard.|$|E
25|$|Georges Cornu√©jols and licensees of his patents (Brdi, Hymatom) {{introduced}} {{the principle of}} HDR video image, in 1986, by interposing a matricial LCD screen {{in front of the}} camera's image sensor, increasing the sensors dynamic by five stops. The concept of neighborhood <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> was applied to video cameras by a group from the Technion in Israel led by Dr. Oliver Hilsenrath and Prof. Y.Y.Zeevi who filed for a patent on this concept in 1988.|$|E
25|$|The {{goals of}} <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> can be {{differently}} stated {{depending on the}} particular application. In some cases producing just aesthetically pleasing images is the main goal, while other applications might emphasize reproducing as many image details as possible, or maximizing the image contrast. The goal in realistic rendering applications might be to obtain a perceptual match between a real scene and a displayed image even though the display device {{is not able to}} reproduce the full range of luminance values.|$|E

In this paper, we aim at showing how point-to-multipoint communications could take advantage of the definition of a Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) transmission mode, considering the context of IEEE P 1901 networks. To do so, this new mode has been integrated in a PLC network simulator and the packet-level performance is assessed, using UDP flows. The first results exhibited in this paper show that, when associated with a recently released allocation algorithm, called the TMS (<b>Tone</b> <b>Maps</b> Splitting) algorithm, this solution could greatly improve data rates in future PLC networks...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTone mapping {{operators}} (TMOs), {{employed to}} fit the dynamic range of High Dynamic Range (HDR) visual signals {{to that of the}} display, are generally non-transparent and modify the visual appearance of the scene. Despite this, <b>tone</b> <b>mapped</b> content generally tends to have more visual details as compared to a single exposure scene. It is however not clear if the extra details in <b>tone</b> <b>mapped</b> HDR affect user preferences over a single exposure content in terms of scene appearance and to what extent. This paper aims to shed light on this issue via a comprehensive subjective study. Our results reveal that there is no statistical evidence to establish if the users preferred <b>tone</b> <b>mapped</b> content over the single exposure version as closer representation of the corresponding HDR scene. We present those results as well as outline the possible factors contributing to this somewhat unexpected findin...|$|R
40|$|High Dynamic Ranges (HDR) {{displays}} {{can show}} images with higher color contrast levels and peak luminosities than the commonly used Low Dynamic Range (LDR) displays. Although HDR displays are still expensive, they are reaching the consumer {{market in the}} coming years. Unfortunately, most video content is recorded and/or graded in LDR format. Typically, dynamic range expansion by using an Inverse <b>Tone</b> <b>Mapped</b> Operator (iTMO) is required to show LDR content in HDR displays. The {{most common type of}} artifact derived from dynamic range expansion is false contouring, which negatively affects the overall image quality. In this paper, we propose a new fast iterative false-contour removal method for inverse <b>tone</b> <b>mapped</b> HDR content. We consider the false-contour removal as a signal reconstruction problem, and we solve it using an iterative Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS) minimization algorithm. Unlike most other false-contour removal techniques, we define reconstruction constraints taking into account the iTMO used. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to remove false contours while preserving details in the image. In order speed-up the execution time, the proposed method was implemented to run on a GPU. We were able to show that {{it can be used to}} remove false contours in real-time from an inverse <b>tone</b> <b>mapped</b> High-definition HDR video sequences at 24 fps...|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{limitations}} of printing and display contrast, the extended luminosity range of an HDR image has to be compressed to be made visible. The method of rendering an HDR image to a standard monitor or printing device is called <b>tone</b> <b>mapping.</b> This method reduces the overall contrast of an HDR image to facilitate display on devices or printouts with lower dynamic range, and {{can be applied to}} produce images with preserved local contrast (or exaggerated for artistic effect).|$|E
25|$|The high {{dynamic range}} image is passed to a <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> operator, {{in this case a}} local operator, which {{transforms}} the image into a low dynamic range image suitable for viewing on a monitor. Relative to the church interior, the stained-glass window is displayed at a much lower brightness than a linear mapping between scene radiance and pixel intensity would produce. However, this inaccuracy is perceptually less important than the image detail, which can now be shown in both the window and the church interior simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Computer graphic {{techniques}} {{capable of}} rendering high-contrast scenes shifted the focus from color to luminance {{as the main}} limiting factor of display devices. Several <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> operators were developed to map high dynamic range (HDR) images to standard displays. More recently, this work has branched away from utilizing luminance to extend image contrast and towards other methods such as user-assisted image reproduction. Currently, image reproduction has shifted towards display-driven solutions since displays now possess advanced image processing algorithms that help adapt rendering of the image to viewing conditions, save power, up-scale color gamut and dynamic range.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{well-known}} allocation technique, called bit-loading, {{results in}} the creation of <b>tone</b> <b>maps</b> which define, for each subcarrier on a particular transmission path, the appropriate constellation that has to be applied based on a link quality criterion. If this technique allows to efficiently optimize point-to-point transmissions in the network, it poses several challenges when transmitting the same information to multiple stations, i. e. Multicast/Broadcast data streams. In this paper, an efficient algorithm that smartly merges similar <b>tone</b> <b>maps</b> is presented, in order to better handle Multicast/Broadcast data streams. The demonstration of its efficiency will be made placing ourselves in the context of power line communications networks following the HPAV specification. However, our merging principle itself remains applicable to any system associating multicarrier modulations and bit-loading algorithms, as it could be in an indoor wireless environment...|$|R
30|$|The first kind of {{inter-layer}} {{prediction is}} from the high bit-depth layer to the low bit-depth layer, where the motion information derived in the high bit-depth layer is shared by the low bit-depth layer.

25|$|One of the {{original}} goals of <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> was {{to be able to}} reproduce a given scene or image onto a display device such that the brightness sensation of the image to a human viewer closely matches the real-world brightness sensation. However, a perfect match for this problem is never possible and thus the output image on a display is often built from a tradeoff between different image features. Choosing between features is often based on the necessary application, and given appropriate metrics for the application, one possible solution is to treat the issue as an optimization problem.|$|E
25|$|Manual <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> was {{accomplished}} by dodging and burning‚Äì selectively increasing or decreasing the exposure of regions of the photograph to yield better tonality reproduction. This was effective because the dynamic range of the negative is significantly higher than would be available on the finished positive paper print when that is exposed via the negative in a uniform manner. An excellent example is the photograph Schweitzer at the Lamp by W. Eugene Smith, from his 1954 photo essay A Man of Mercy on Dr. Albert Schweitzer and his humanitarian work in French Equatorial Africa. The image took 5 days to reproduce the tonal range of the scene, which ranges from a bright lamp (relative to the scene) to a dark shadow.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{commonly}} used <b>tone</b> <b>mapping</b> algorithms is the iCAM06 {{which is based}} on both the color appearance model and hierarchical mapping. After bilateral filtering, the image is broken into a base layer and a detail layer. White point adaptation and chrominance adaptation are applied to the base layer, while detail enhancement is applied to the detail layer. Eventually the two layers are merged and converted to the IPT color space. In general, this method is good but has some shortcomings, specifically in how computationally heavy the filtering method is. A proposed solution to this involves performance optimization of the filter. The base layer of the image is also converted to the RGB space for tone compression. This method also allows for more output adjustment and saturation enhancement, making it be less computationally intensive and better at reducing the overall halo effect.|$|E
