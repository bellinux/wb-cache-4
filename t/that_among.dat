5|$|According to the 1993 book by Russian {{psychiatrist}} Mikhail Buyanov, {{the harm}} inflicted by Soviet punitive psychiatry {{on the image}} of domestic medicine is, of course, great, but bears no comparison to the crimes of the Nazi doctors. Now, when all the passions have cooled, one {{can say that the}} zeal of Soviet psychiatrists inflicted suffering on up to 100 or 120 people of all 280 million citizens of the former Soviet Union, Buyanov writes. He adds <b>that</b> <b>among</b> the persons were many fanatical nationalists, religious sectarians, and political paranoiacs who after escaping to freedom corrupted the masses, сrammed their heads with nonsense, carried away immature people with their ideas through the connivance of the so-called progressive intelligentsia, and a result of it is wars, blood, and reciprocal hatred.|$|E

He was called for the draft in the United States Army in August 1942, but was rejected on medical grounds. He had been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1942–43 but did not use it, choosing instead to teach at Swarthmore College in 1942–45.|$|E

5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} a major {{contributor}} to female mortality in India. Indians account for 60% of the world's heart disease burden, despite accounting for less than 20% of the world's population. Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue. Women have higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular disease than men in India because of differential access to health care between the sexes. One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care. For example, it was found <b>that</b> <b>among</b> patients with congenital heart disease, women {{were less likely to be}} operated on than men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable.|$|E
5|$|Dinheirosaurus {{is one of}} {{relatively}} few sauropods for which gastroliths were found obviously alongside the type specimen. In 2007, an experiment using Dinheirosaurus, Diplodocus (=Seismosaurus), and Cedarosaurus tested if sauropods used their gastroliths in an avian-style gastric mill. The analysis took into account <b>that</b> <b>among</b> the hundreds of sauropods found, gastroliths are only known from a few associated specimens. Authors chose to use the three sauropods with the most associated gastroliths, Dinheirosaurus, Diplodocus, and Cedarosaurus, {{because of the large}} amount of gastroliths found in birds. When birds were typically found to have 1.05% of their body weight gastroliths, the sauropod Diplodocus, which had the highest amount of gastroliths, only amassed to 0.03% body weight. This means that since the other sauropods Dinheirosaurus and Cedarosaurus had less gastroliths to body mass, an avian-style gastric mill is unlikely to have evolved in sauropods, and they instead might have used gastroliths to absorb minerals.|$|E
5|$|Discovery of the Kiger Mustang was {{the result}} of a BLM Mustang roundup in the Beatys Butte area in Harney County in 1977. During the roundup, it was noticed <b>that</b> <b>among</b> the horses {{collected}} from the area, there was a group with similar color and markings. DNA testing by the University of Kentucky showed close relation to the Spanish horses brought to the Americas in the 17th century. These distinct horses were separated from the other horses and the BLM placed two groups in separate areas of Steens Mountain to preserve the breed. Seven horses were placed in the Riddle Mountain Herd Management Area (HMA) and twenty in the Kiger HMA.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the Graceland tour, she worked with journalist James Hall to write an autobiography titled Makeba: My Story. The book contained descriptions of her experience with apartheid, and was also critical of the commodification and consumerism she experienced in the US. The book was translated into five languages. She {{took part in the}} Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute, a popular-music concert staged on 11 June 1988 at London's Wembley Stadium, and broadcast to an audience of 600 million across 67 countries. Political aspects of the concert were heavily censored in the US by the Fox television network. The use of music to raise awareness of apartheid paid off: a survey after the concert found <b>that</b> <b>among</b> people aged between 16 and 24, three-quarters knew of Mandela, and supported his release from prison.|$|E

He went on to post 35 wins, breaking Vanbiesbrouck's 27-win single-season Panthers mark, set in 1996–97. Set to become a free agent {{for the second consecutive}} off-season, he could not come to an agreement with the Panthers, having formally turned down a five-year, $30million contract offer in January 2006. It was also reported <b>that</b> <b>among</b> Luongo's demands were that backup goaltender Jamie McLennan be re-signed, his long-time goaltending coach François Allaire be hired and that a public statement be released {{that he would not be}} traded until the no-trade clause of his contract took effect.|$|E
5|$|One poll {{reported}} in the journal Nature showed <b>that</b> <b>among</b> American scientists (across various disciplines), about 40 percent believe in both evolution and an active deity (theistic evolution). This {{is similar to the}} results reported for surveys of the general American public. Also, about 40 percent of the scientists polled believe in a God that answers prayers, and believe in immortality. While about 55% of scientists surveyed were atheists, agnostics, or nonreligious theists, atheism is far from universal among scientists who support evolution, or among the general public that supports evolution. Very similar results were reported from a 1997 Gallup Poll of the American public and scientists.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Baghdadi Jews in India, the Jews {{residing}} in Bombay — the name then used for Mumbai — had settled in the towns of India, living peacefully with other communities in India. Harry D. Wall, in an interview to the New York Times, has said <b>that</b> <b>among</b> the Jews who now remain in Mumbai are a group of Jews known as Bene Jews or Bene Israel who were reportedly descendants of seven tribes of Israel who, in the 2nd century BC, were shipwrecked on India's Konkan coast while escaping persecution in the Galilee. They found that living in India, amidst a cosmopolitan community consisting of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and, much later, Muslims, was a very cordial environment, totally free of anti-Semitic feelings.|$|E
5|$|R.C. Hazra {{suggests}} that the Mudgala Purana is older than the Ganesha Purana, which he dates between 1100 and 1400. However, Phyllis Granoff finds problems with this relative dating and concludes that the Mudgala Purana {{was the last of}} the philosophical texts concerned with Ganesha. She bases her reasoning on the fact <b>that,</b> <b>among</b> other internal evidence, the Mudgala Purana specifically mentions the Ganesha Purana as one of the four Puranas (the Brahma, the Brahmanda, the Ganesha, and the Mudgala Puranas) which deal at length with Ganesha. While the kernel of the text must be old, it was interpolated until the 17th and 18th centuries as the worship of Ganapati became more important in certain regions. Another highly regarded scripture, the Ganapati Atharvashirsa, was probably composed during the 16th or 17th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Scorsese {{has stated}} in {{interviews}} <b>that</b> <b>among</b> {{the most difficult}} aspects of the film to represent were the spiritual themes presented in Endo's original book used for the film. The first version of the script he attempted to write with his co-writer Jay Cocks only managed to get midway through the material, before being set aside as insufficiently sensitive to the spiritual aspects of the book. It took Scorsese many years to envision a way to approach an accurate and informed filming of the scenes, involving spiritual transitions among the actors in the film.|$|E
