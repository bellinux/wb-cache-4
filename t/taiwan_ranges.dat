30|$|The {{climate of}} <b>Taiwan</b> <b>ranges</b> from {{subtropical}} {{in the northern}} and central regions to tropical {{in the south and}} temperate in the mountainous regions. East Asian winter monsoons bring precipitation to the east and north of Taiwan while the south has little rain in the winter. Conversely, East Asian summer monsoons bring typhoons that can be damaging to south-western Taiwan (Executive Yuan 2014). For example, typhoon Morakot deposited 2965  mm of rain over a 4 -day period in August 2009, with a peak 24 -h rainfall of 1623.5  mm (Wu 2013). Taiwan experiences many typhoons each year and {{has one of the highest}} frequencies of tropical typhoons globally (Lin et al. 2017). Climate strongly affects forest types in Taiwan. Broadleaf forests are generally found at lower elevations but graduate into coniferous forests at higher elevations. Climate change poses a considerable threat to these ecosystems due to the influence of temperature and moisture gradients on forests (Li et al. 2013).|$|E

30|$|Japanese cedar (Chrytomeria japonica D. Don) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} plantation species in Taiwan, representing 10 % of the total plantation area (Forestry Bureau, 1994). It was first introduced in Xitou in 1910. Due to the robust growth performance and the suitable climatic and soil properties (Young, 1975), Japanese cedar was commercially grown over wide areas in the northern and central mountainous areas of Taiwan. The establishment of Japanese cedar plantations reached its peak between 1950 and 1980, but dramatically declined when the focus of national forest management policy shifted from planting exotic species (e.g., Japanese cedar) to native species in 1980. Current stand age for most Japanese cedar plantations in <b>Taiwan</b> <b>ranges</b> between 30 and 50 years and reaches or even exceeds their normal rotation period (40 – 45 years; Wang 1977). This situation has been effectuated partly by a ban on logging in natural forests, which began in 1990, and partly by unfavorable economics in the cedar industry that led to reductions in harvesting. Because the old plantation forests have generally been thought as a carbon-neutral state (Odum, 1969), it is of interest to quantify if the “aging” processes of the current Japanese cedar plantations could be able for future C accumulation.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDown {{syndrome}} {{is the most}} common autosomal chromosome aneuploidy. The prenatal Down syndrome screening protocol has been known in Taiwan for the past 20 years. The maternal serum double markers required for the screening test was first implemented into the general prenatal check-up back in 1994, where it had around a 60 % detection rate at a 5 % false positive rate. The first trimester combined test was started in 2005, and the maternal serum quadruple test was introduced in 2008 to replace the previous double test. The overall detection rate for the current screening strategies (first trimester combined or second trimester quadruple test) in <b>Taiwan</b> <b>ranges</b> between 80 % and 85 % at a fixed 5 % false positive rate. Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is the latest powerful fetal aneuploidy detection method and has become commercially available in Taiwan starting from 2013. The sensitivity and specificity for NIPT are very high (both over 99 %) according to large worldwide studies. Our preliminary data for NIPT from 11 medical centers in Taiwan have also shown a 100 % detection rate for Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome, respectively. Invasive chromosome studies such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling cannot be replaced by NIPT, and all prenatal screening and NIPT results require confirmation using invasive testing.

To address this, we surveyed the geometry of several deformed strata and geomorphic surfaces, which recorded different cumulative amounts of shortening. These units were dated to ages 2 ranging from ~ 19 ka to ~ 340 ka using Optical Stimulated Luminescence (OSL). We collected shallow seismic profiles and used previously published seismic profiles to constrain the deep structure of the fold. These data show that the anticline has formed {{as a result of}} pure shear with subsequent limb rotation. The cumulative shortening along the direction of tectonic transport (N 118 E) is estimated to be 1010 +/- 160 m.

This study analyzed three foreign laborers who had contracted enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-confirmed A cantonensis infection while working in Taiwan. All three workers had consumed either roasted snails or raw snails flavored with seasoning while drinking wine. This study investigated possible risk factors for A cantonensis, including naturally occurring A cantonensis in A canaliculatus snails, viability of third-stage A cantonensis larvae in raw seasoned snails and in roasted snails, infectivity of larvae, and effects of alcohol while consuming snails. Positive infection rates in snails from five different irrigation canals in south <b>Taiwan</b> <b>ranged</b> from 12. 3 % to 29. 4 % and the average number of motile larvae per infected snail ranged from 36 to 65. The number of motile and coiled larvae in snail meat after 120 minutes seasoning was 93 (27. 7 %) and 233 (69. 3 %), respectively. After 20 minutes of roasting, most larvae in the snail meat were dead. The infectivities of motile and coiled larvae from snail meat after 60 minutes seasoning were 53. 2 % and 33. 2 %, respectively, and those from snail meat after 5 minutes roasting were 33. 2 % and 7. 0 %, respectively. Eating Taiwan A canaliculatus snails raw is extremely risky given their high infection rates and infection intensities. Even after 120 minutes seasoning or after 20 minutes roasting, snail meat should be considered unsafe for human consumption.

40|$|National audienceThe <b>Taiwan</b> <b>range</b> {{results from}} the {{collision}} between the Chinese continental margin and the Luzon volcanic arc. It has been key {{in the development of}} a popular model of mountain-building, in which a range can be considered as a critical wedge growing by frontal accretion of material. In this case, shortening is expected to be distributed within the whole range to compensate the loss of material due to erosion. However the kinematics of deformation, crucial to test this model, has remained up to now unresolved. To address this issue, we have first conducted morphotectonic investigations on the active faults of the western foothills to assess their contribution to crustal shortening over time scales of ~ 10 s to ~ 100 s kyr. From deformed fluvial terraces and geomorphic markers, dated using OSL and radiocarbon, we derive the slip rates on the Changhua and Chelungpu thrust faults, at the front of the range (Simoes et al, symposium 7). We get that most of (if not all) the shortening is absorbed within the western foothills, leaving little (if any) internal shortening within the range. These findings contradict the model previously proposed for mountain-building in Taiwan. Indeed, shortening localized at the front requires that the range growth is sustained by underplating rather than by frontal accretion. To test this scenario on the longer term, we implement this kinematics into a thermo-kinematic model, which is adjusted to fit available structural, thermometric (RSCM) and low-temperature thermochronological data [FT and (U-TH) /He]. All these geological constraints provide a consistent picture of the kinematics of deformation in Taiwan, and indicate that our previous results also hold over at least the last 2 Myr. The thermal model also allows for quantifying vertical deformation and exhumation rates over the whole range. Our study provides quantitative constraints on mountain-building processes in Taiwan that ought to be considered in future mechanical models...|$|R
