5|$|Bovista pila, {{commonly}} known as the tumbling puffball, is a species of puffball fungus in the family Agaricaceae. A temperate species, it is widely distributed in North America, where it grows on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>on</b> road sides, in pastures, grassy areas, and open woods. There are few well-documented occurrences of B.pila outside North America. B.pila closely resembles the European B.nigrescens, from which it can be reliably distinguished only by microscopic characteristics.|$|E

5|$|The Tudor Revival-style Briarcliff Lodge {{was opened}} in 1902 as a premier resort hotel.

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Podoserpula pusio grow on <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>on</b> well-rotted stumps, or among {{decaying}} tussock grass. They are {{presumed to be}} saprobic, and obtain nutrients by breaking down larger organic molecules found in the soil or in decaying wood. P.miranda in contrast, {{is thought to be}} ectomycorrhizal, as it appears to associate with Arillastrum gummiferum, the predominant canopy tree in the forests where it is found.|$|E
5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} whirlwind) resembles a tornado {{in that it is}} a {{vertical}} swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>on</b> a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.|$|E
5|$|After an {{erroneous}} scouting {{report of}} approaching Mexican troops, Baker burned San Felipe de Austin to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>on</b> March 30. When Baker claimed Houston {{had given him}} an order to do so, Houston denied it. Houston's account was that the residents burned their own property {{to keep it out}} of the hands of the Mexican army. San Felipe de Austin's residents did as those before them in escaping the Mexican army, and fled to the east.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they had}} {{initially}} {{been told that}} they would be withdrawn from the front within 48 hours, the strategic situation called that they remained at the front holding <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>on</b> the eastern flank. In late July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large wooded area, as the Germans began to withdraw. Nevertheless, little progress was made, and, after a brief move which saw No. 6 Commando advance to Bavent, they went on the defensive again.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{left the}} Centralia area on September 27, pursued {{for the first}} time by Union forces {{equipped}} with artillery. Anderson evaded the pursuit, leading his men into ravines that the Union troops would not enter for fear of ambush. In the aftermath of the attacks, Union soldiers committed several revenge killings of Confederate-sympathizing civilians. They burned Rocheport to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>on</b> October 2; the town was under close scrutiny by Union forces, owing to the number of Confederate sympathizers there, but General Fisk maintained that the fire was accidental. Anderson watched the fire from nearby bluffs.|$|E
5|$|At its 1902 opening, the Briarcliff Lodge was {{a premier}} resort hotel. The Tudor Revival-style {{building}} {{was surrounded by}} dairy barns and greenhouses (built by Law), and hosted numerous distinguished guests, including Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. The hotel declined during the 1930s but the lodge remained in use, housing the Edgewood Park School (1936–1954) and The King's College (1955–1994). The original 1902 Briarcliff Lodge building burned to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>on</b> September 20, 2003, and contemporary portions of the lodge and other campus buildings were later demolished.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} and risk of meeting the Huaorani on the ground, the missionaries chose to drop gifts to the Huaorani by fixed-wing aircraft. Their drop technique, developed by Nate Saint, involved flying around the drop location in tight circles while lowering the gift from the plane on a rope. This kept the bundle in roughly {{the same position as}} it approached <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>On</b> October 6, 1955, Saint made the first drop, releasing a small kettle containing buttons and rock salt. The gift-giving continued during the following weeks, with the missionaries dropping machetes, ribbons, clothing, pots, and various trinkets.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{started a}} {{pineapple}} plantation on Key Biscayne; six acres (two-and-a-half hectares) {{had been cleared}} and planted in pineapples in 1893–94. Davis also directed his caretaker to plant one-half to one acre (two-tenths to four-tenths of a hectare) of bananas. By 1898, {{a great variety of}} tropical fruit trees had been planted on the island. Davis also had a large dwelling built for his use. It was a two-story cottage with five bedrooms and verandas on three sides, raised ten feet above <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>on</b> pilings to protect against storm surges.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{undertook}} {{a wave of}} castle-building during his visit in 1171 to protect his new territories—the Anglo-Normans had superior military technologies to the Irish, and castles gave them a significant advantage. Henry hoped for a longer term political solution, however, similar to his approach in Wales and Scotland, and in 1175 he agreed to the Treaty of Windsor, under which Rory O'Connor would be recognised as the high king of Ireland, giving homage to Henry and maintaining stability on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>on</b> his behalf. This policy proved unsuccessful, as O'Connor was unable to exert sufficient influence and force {{in areas such as}} Munster: Henry instead intervened more directly, establishing a system of local fiefs of his own through a conference held in Oxford in 1177.|$|E

5|$|In 1902 {{the club}} {{required}} a larger ground {{and moved to}} Edgeley Park, then home of the rugby league club Stockport, who {{went out of business}} three years later. Green Lane was retained for use by the club's reserve team, and one further first team game was played at <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>on</b> 18 April 1903 when Edgeley Park was being used by the rugby club. The site was later used for housing. Stockport County have played home games at Edgeley Park {{since the start of the}} 1902–03 season, celebrating the centenary in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, Gus Mears {{acquired}} the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium {{with the aim}} of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered. Chelsea were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook), opposite the present-day main entrance to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>on</b> Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish army, led by Francisco Verdugo, with Lieutenant-Colonel Johann Baptista von Taxis {{as second}} in command, was {{deployed}} before {{the village of}} Noordhorn and behind broken ground with only one access point that was covered by a wide ravine and flanked on its left {{by a series of}} muddy ditches. Aiming to create a trap for Norreys' army, the Spanish had smoothed <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>on</b> their right in order to funnel English units and draw Norrey's troops into an engagement area where a crossfire effect could be created. Verdugo himself drove two stakes into the ground to mark the point that his cavalry was to charge upon the English vanguard.|$|E

5|$|The diet of {{the bird}} can be varied. They eat various forms of foliage and other grassy {{material}} that they find on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>on</b> in trees and shrubs. Dusky woodswallows have been seen eating termites, butterflies and other insects. They also eat nectar from flowers. One notable aspect of their feeding habits {{is the way they}} hunt flying insects, which is done by picking them up on their wing. They do, however, also eat their prey from the ground, and they often find inconspicuous places to perch while waiting for prey, such as utility lines and the like. They have also been observed engaging in kleptoparasitism, working as a group to rob a restless flycatcher of its prey. Kleptoparasitism is extremely unusual in passerine birds, as is cooperative kleptoparasitsim in general.|$|E

Another video obtained by The Guardian on 21 April shows Tomlinson standing by a bicycle rack, hands in his pockets, when the police approach him. After he is hit, he can be seen scraping along <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>on</b> {{the right side of}} his forehead; eyewitnesses spoke of hearing a noise as his head hit the ground.|$|E
