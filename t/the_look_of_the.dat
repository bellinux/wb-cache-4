It was awarded an Emmy Award for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to {{its status}} as a {{first-class}} fortification, Fort Stanton continued to receive regular maintenance and was continually garrisoned even after the final armistice. Work was even done to strengthen the defenses, as a stockade was added in the summer of 1865, and the parapets of the fort were re-sodded with fresh grass for better traction and to improve <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fortification.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} filmed on sets that are an exact {{replica of the}} house.

The house became available for rent on Airbnb for six months, beginning February 2016, before being unlisted.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Roger Deakins {{discussed}} <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{film with}} the Coens during pre-production. They {{told him that}} they wanted {{some parts of the}} film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look. Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.|$|E

5|$|Contracting out to {{independent}} studios, Philips subsequently used the characters to create three {{games for the}} CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give input on <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters based on the artwork from Nintendo's original two titles and that of their respective instruction booklets. Philips insisted that the development studios utilize {{all aspects of the}} CD-i's capabilities including FMV, high-resolution graphics, and CD-quality music. Because the system had not been designed as a dedicated video game console, there were several technical limitations, such as laggy controls (especially for the standard infrared controller), and numerous problems in streaming-audio, memory, disc access, and graphics.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of the PlayStation 2, Sony {{reported}} that the new system had compatibility issues with the Final Fantasy V half of Final Fantasy Anthology. The game experienced a bug where if players attempted to save their games, a graphical error would occur. Square then released a statement that only <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> save screen was corrupted, and saving was still possible, and if players wished, repeatedly going {{into and out of the}} save screen would make a normal screen eventually appear. This incompatibility was fixed for the PAL and Greatest Hits releases of Final Fantasy Anthology.|$|E
5|$|Green {{also took}} photos of a {{prepared}} list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio. These included many real estate offices and homes {{such as those}} belonging to Marion and her sister. He also found a girl who looked just like he imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bates house was modeled on Edward Hopper's painting The House by the Railroad, a fanciful portrait of the Second Empire Victorian home at 18 Conger Avenue in Haverstraw, New York.|$|E

5|$|In {{over one}} or more sittings, a highly skilled {{sculptor}} from Madame Tussauds Studios who is given {{direct access to the}} celebrity will record the colours of the hair and eyes, and over 500 precise body measurements are referenced. Most important is to capture <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task is to make a clay model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{had never}} been happy with the brightly lit {{corridors}} and feel of the Enterprise, a dissatisfaction that extended to his work on The Wrath of Khan. For The Undiscovered Country, Meyer wanted the Enterprise interiors to feel grittier and more realistic; the metal was worn around the edges to look used without looking beat up. Narita's plans to transform <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enterprise on a scale not seen since The Wrath of Khan were complicated by the necessary use of existing sets.|$|E
5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower masts in {{wood was}} not feasible, {{so they were}} made of steel tube cut and welded to shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the {{platforms}} on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. Warriors engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron to duplicate <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they might have looked in operation.|$|E

5000|$|Bus {{and coach}} {{industry}} graphic designer Ray Stenning praised <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Panorama Elite III {{in an article}} for Buses Annual 1981. He described it as Plaxton's [...] "zenith", adding that it [...] "looked just right and still looks just right".|$|R
5|$|The {{originally}} scheduled {{start date}} was mid-August 1995, but filming was delayed until February 26, 1996. Director Tim Burton hired Peter Suschitzky as the cinematographer, {{because he was}} a fan of his work in David Cronenberg's films. Production designer Thomas Wynn (A Beautiful Mind, Malcolm X) intended to have the war room pay tribute to Dr. Strangelove (1964). During production, Burton insisted that the art direction, cinematography and costume design of Mars Attacks! incorporate <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1960s trading cards.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{episode was}} shot on {{location}} {{in a house in}} Country Club Park, Los Angeles, California, which serves as the haunted house and crime scene in the series. Designed and built around 1908 by Alfred Rosenheim, the president of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Institute of Architects, the Tudor or Collegiate Gothic-style single family home was previously used as a convent. The series is filmed on sets that are an exact replica of the house. Details such as Lewis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows, and hammered bronze light fixtures, were re-created to preserve <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house.|$|E
5|$|To {{recreate}} the art style {{used in the}} manga, Capcom developed a graphics technique called Artistoon, with which the game renders cel-shaded graphics; additionally, Araki's art was featured in the game. Capcom planned to release the game in North America and Europe, but after delays, it ended up not getting released outside Japan. Critics praised the game's visuals and presentation, commenting on how it recreated <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manga well, while the gameplay was met by mixed opinions.|$|E
50|$|As was {{the case}} with the E46 M3 Concept and E60 M5 Concept, the M3 Concept had almost no {{differences}} from <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production version, that had its world premiere on the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show IAA (Germany, 12 to 23 September).|$|R
50|$|In 1982, {{the first}} Birchfield Sports was {{produced}} {{but it was}} only intended to be a one-off. A company called Shapecraft in Northampton, UK, then developed the concept further as a (small) production-run vehicle using Jaguar XJ6 mechanicals, with <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS Jaguar.|$|R
5000|$|Popsugar of Buzzsugar gave a good {{review to}} the episode stating: [...] "From <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preview, I {{definitely}} thought this week {{would just be}} a filler episode, but it managed to keep up <b>the</b> pace <b>of</b> last week's super intense and amazing Haunted." ...|$|R
5|$|Two {{months of}} {{pre-production}} {{were required to}} create hundreds of shields, spears, and swords, {{some of which were}} recycled from Troy and Alexander. Creatures were designed by Jordu Schell, and an animatronic wolf and thirteen animatronic horses were created. The actors trained alongside the stuntmen, and even Snyder joined in. Upwards of 600 costumes were created for the film, as well as extensive prosthetics for various characters and the corpses of Persian soldiers. Shaun Smith and Mark Rappaport worked hand in hand with Snyder in pre-production to design <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual characters, and to produce the prosthetic makeup effects, props, weapons and dummy bodies required for the production.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Trumbull was {{the visual}} effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi {{designed}} the aliens. Trumbull joked that the visual effects budget, at $3.3million, {{could have been}} used to produce an additional film. His work helped lead to advances in motion control photography. The mother ship was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and built by Greg Jein. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship was inspired by an oil refinery Spielberg saw at night in India. Instead of the metallic hardware look used in Star Wars, the emphasis was on a more luminescent look for the UFOs. One of the UFO models was an oxygen mask with lights attached to it, used because of its irregular shape. As a subtle in-joke, Dennis Muren (who had just finished working on Star Wars) put a small R2-D2 model onto the underside of the mothership. The model of the mothership is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Annex at Washington Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In May 1991, {{following}} an unsuccessful attempt with Sony {{to develop a}} CD-ROM-based add-on for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo signed a deal with Philips to develop the aforementioned add-on. However, witnessing the poor reception of the Sega Mega-CD, Nintendo no longer considered the add-on profitable, and the project was scrapped entirely. As part of dissolving the deal, Nintendo gave Philips the license to use five of their characters, including Mario, Luigi and Princess Toadstool, to be featured in their games for the CD-i. The games were given little time to be developed and little funding, and Nintendo only gave cursory input. Philips used the characters to create games for the CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give input on <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters. Apart from Hotel Mario, the Mario characters were intended {{to be used in}} Super Mario's Wacky Worlds, but the game was cancelled with only some prototype versions being programmed. While Wacky Worlds was planned as a CD-i adaptation of the side-scrolling platformer Super Mario World, Hotel Mario was made into a puzzle game in which stage areas were restricted to a single screen. Unlike the Legend of Zelda-related games, the game was not developed by a third-party company, but by Philips' development team Fantasy Factory.|$|E
