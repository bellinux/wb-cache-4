5|$|Groups of anti-Rwandan {{government}} rebels {{like the}} FDLR, {{and other foreign}} fighters remain inside the DRC. The FDLR which is the greatest concern, was some 6,000 strong, in July 2007.

50|$|Out-group-directed {{emotions}} can {{be expressed}} both verbally and non-verbally, {{and according to the}} stereotype content model, are dictated by two dimensions: the perceived warmth (How friendly and sincere is <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>group?)</b> and competence of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> (How skillful is <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>group?).</b> Depending on <b>the</b> perceived degree of warmth and competence, the stereotype content model predicts four basic emotions that could be directed toward the out-group (Forsyth, 2006).|$|R
40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{research}} examining how the proportion of women and men in a group effects both the group member’s perception of group climate and the aggregated perceptions of <b>group</b> climate for <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members. We adapted the group actor–partner interdependence model (GAPIM; Kenny & Garcia, 2012) to examine how the perception of the group’s climate by a group member and by <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members are related to the group member’s sex and the sex of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members. In addition, we examined how similar the group member’s sex was to the sex of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members by analyzing the interaction between the two sex variables. A total of 110 Italian graduate students (96 women, 87 %; 14 men, 13 %) were studied in six 10 -session training groups. Group members filled out the Group Climate Questionnaire–Short Form after the fifth group session. Contrary to hypotheses derived from Kanter’s (Kanter, 2006) theory about the experience of tokens in groups, male group members did not perceive a more therapeutic group climate (i. e., higher engagement and lower conflict) as the proportion of women in a group decreased. There were, however, consistent and large effects for the sex composition of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members. Specifically, as the proportion of women in the group increased, both the <b>group</b> member and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members perceived <b>the</b> group climate as more engaging and as having less conflict. In addition, a group member’s perception of group climate was positively related to the aggregated climate perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members. Additionally, group size was related to less engagement and more conflict, as rated by <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members, and less engagement, as rated by the group member. The findings suggest that the GAPIM is a useful approach for examining group composition...|$|R

5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} head, {{with a pair}} of large {{compound}} eyes, and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and sucking in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>groups.</b> Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their source of their food. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.|$|E
5|$|Four {{different}} types of male flowers exist. On {{the basis of these}} flower types, the genus has often been split into four genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea. The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have coiled anthers, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>groups</b> have straight ones. The petals of those placed in Maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens, while those placed in Scheelea and a more narrowly defined Attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens. Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus.|$|E
5|$|In 1930 or 1931, al-Qassam had {{recruited}} numerous hand-picked {{followers and}} organized them into {{about a dozen}} different circles, each group of supporters unaware {{of the existence of}} <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>groups.</b> The majority of his men were peasants and urban laborers. The majority of al-Qassam's circles were based in northern Palestine, but he had disciples throughout the country, including in Gaza in the south. In contrast to traditional Palestinian leaders who campaigned against Zionist settlement while avoiding confrontation with the British authorities, al-Qassam saw it as a priority to fight against both. He also saw the brewing conflict in Palestine as a religious struggle, unlike most Palestinian leaders who advocated a secular and nationalist response. Al-Qassam advocated a moral, political and military jihad as the solution to end British rule and Zionist aspirations in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two studies}} on the {{incidence}} of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample {{were significantly more likely}} to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>groups,</b> however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD. The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in maltreated rather than neglected toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD. This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.|$|E
5|$|When dinosaurs appeared, {{they were}} not the {{dominant}} terrestrial animals. The terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of archosauromorphs and therapsids, like cynodonts and rhynchosaurs. Their main competitors were the pseudosuchia, such as aetosaurs, ornithosuchids and rauisuchians, which were more successful than the dinosaurs. Most of these other animals became extinct in the Triassic, in one of two events. First, at about 215million years ago, a variety of basal archosauromorphs, including the protorosaurs, became extinct. This was followed by the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event (about 200million years ago), that saw the end of most of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>groups</b> of early archosaurs, like aetosaurs, ornithosuchids, phytosaurs, and rauisuchians. Rhynchosaurs and dicynodonts survived (at least in some areas) at least as late as early-mid Norian and early Rhaetian, respectively, and the exact date of their extinction is uncertain. These losses left behind a land fauna of crocodylomorphs, dinosaurs, mammals, pterosaurians, and turtles. The first few lines of early dinosaurs diversified through the Carnian and Norian stages of the Triassic, possibly by occupying the niches of the groups that became extinct.|$|E
