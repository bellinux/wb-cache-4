Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes {{to be placed in}} the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without the need for provocation, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. <b>The</b> <b>crate</b> opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in a bathroom, and a man using another bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX.|$|E
25|$|Another of Houdini's {{most famous}} {{publicity}} stunts was {{to escape from}} a nailed and roped packing crate after it had been lowered into water. He first performed the escape in New York's East River on July 7, 1912. Police forbade him from {{using one of the}} piers, so he hired a tugboat and invited press on board. Houdini was locked in handcuffs and leg-irons, then nailed into <b>the</b> <b>crate</b> which was roped and weighed down with two hundred pounds of lead. <b>The</b> <b>crate</b> was then lowered into the water.

25|$|The Doctor and Stark {{run down}} to the room where Rivesh and Seruba are, but find that Seruba is cradling Rivesh. She reveals that Azlok has mortally injured him and he is dying. However, Surbua says there was {{something}} in the ship that could revive him, but Stark says that anything found in the ship was stored in the Area 51 vault, which hasn't been entered for some time as something got loose in there. The Doctor, Cassie, Jimmy, Seruba and Stark arrive at the vault, and the Doctor asks Jimmy and Cassie to find the TARDIS back at Dry Springs. Inside the vault, the Doctor and Seruba go and look for the device they need. Meanwhile, in the Viperox lair Azlok gets the Viperox Queen to release her newly hatched brood, so that they will destroy the whole town. Back in the vault, the Doctor comes across a swarm of Skorpius Flies, a carnivorous alien species that form a group mind. Seruba tells the Doctor she has found the device that could revive Rivesh, but the Skorpius Flies chase after them until the Doctor finds a crate and hides inside. He helps Seruba escape inside <b>the</b> <b>crate</b> by working out how many steps he took on the way in. At the Area 51 base Stark is informed that they are getting reports of Viperox attacks. He orders a row of tanks to block the Viperox off. The Doctor and Seruba shuffle out of the vault inside <b>the</b> <b>crate</b> so the flies won't notice. Meanwhile, Cassie and Jimmy are driving along with the TARDIS on the back of Jimmy's pickup truck when the Viperox burst out of the ground into their path.|$|E

500|$|... "Bart on the Road" [...] is {{the twentieth}} episode of The Simpsons seventh season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on March 31, 1996. In the episode, Bart makes his own fake driver's license. He rents a car with it and takes Milhouse, Martin, and Nelson on a road trip to Knoxville, Tennessee.

To get Bart home, Homer orders equipment for the power plant and ships it via courier from Knoxville, with the boys stowed away inside <b>the</b> <b>crate.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lane, Wheeler, and an {{employee}} of Adams named John Loud examined Adams' ledgers for any transactions involving Colt {{and went to the}} mayor of New York City, Robert Hunter Morris, with the evidence. Other witnesses said that Adams was last seen entering Colt's apartment on September 17 and that Colt had a crate delivered by a carman the next day.

The cylindrical wound which Whiting and Gilman thought was made by a ball fired from a revolver was actually caused {{by one of the}} nails used by Colt to seal <b>the</b> <b>crate.</b> [...] Gilman conceded that the wound was caused by a nail and admitted that no foreign object such as a ball from a revolver was found in the victim's head.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} television sources and critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode 7.5/10 and said: [...] "While it featured more than [...] {{a couple of}} genuinely unfunny ideas, this episode succeeds for the most part. [...] While this episode definitely won't make anyone's top ten list of great Family Guy, there was a much better balance between random humor and storytelling in this outing". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, and said that Family Guy [...] "started things out {{on the wrong foot}} with an oh-so-relevant Jackass storyline. [...] Most of the Jackass stuff was way too stale–Peter jackknifing Quagmire into <b>the</b> <b>crate</b> of bees notwithstanding–but thankfully it was just setup for a far superior storyline, the introduction of a younger 'New Brian'".|$|E
500|$|Bickerton {{began work}} on the air-tractor sledge on 14 April 1912. His first job was to repair the sledge, which had been damaged in transit when a violent storm hit the Aurora. A giant wave had slammed into <b>the</b> <b>crate</b> {{containing}} the sledge, driving the fuselage [...] through its side. With the repair completed, Bickerton began the serious work of converting the plane into a sledge. He constructed brakes {{from a pair of}} geological drills, and a steering system from the landing gear. Bickerton painted the engine and fuel tank black to absorb heat better and protect them from freezing. By June he had the engine running properly, and during a lull in the winds in early September he fitted the skis. Finally, he raised the fuselage [...] off the ground to allow the propeller free movement.|$|E

500|$|Ellen's {{body was}} {{examined}} by five physicians: police surgeon Charles Templeman, his colleague Alexander Stalker, Edinburgh surgeon Henry Littlejohn and two local doctors, David Lennox and William Kinnear. They concluded that Ellen had been strangled from behind. Her right leg was broken {{in two places}} {{so it could be}} crammed into <b>the</b> <b>crate.</b> Incisions, made by the penknife, ran downwards along her abdomen and had been made [...] "within at most ten minutes of the time of death" [...] according to Templeman, Stalker and Littlejohn. Lennox disagreed and thought the wounds were made later on the basis that when he examined the body the wound was not everted, but Templeman and Stalker said the wound was everted when they examined the body. Littlejohn explained that as Lennox made his examination three days after the others, the shape of the wounds could have changed, to which Lennox agreed.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} before the execution, Bury confessed to Reverend Gough that he had killed Ellen. At the urging of Gough, William wrote a {{confession}} on 22 April 1889, which he asked to be withheld until after he was dead. William claimed that he had strangled Ellen without premeditation on the night of 4 February 1889 during a drunken row over money, and that he had tried to dismember the body for disposal the next day but was too squeamish to continue. The latter part of this confession does not match the expert testimony of the physicians, who said that the incisions were made [...] "within at most ten minutes of the time of death" [...] rather than the next day. William stated he had stuffed Ellen's body into <b>the</b> <b>crate</b> as part of a later plan for disposal, but instead concocted the suicide story when he realised that Ellen's absence would be noted.|$|E
