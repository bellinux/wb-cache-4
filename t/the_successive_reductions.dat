A study of oxidizing products by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in NaOH solution showed ten anodic and eight cathodic peaks which are described in the present paper. The behaviour of these alloy electrodes is some-where between pure silver and pure copper electrodes. Differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV) was used to measure zinc, cadmium and lead in ultrapure water only (18 MΩcm), and good linearity was found for all metals (r 2 = 0. 998) in the range of 0. 5 to 5 ppb with a 600 -to 1, 200 -s plating time. It was additionally found that cadmium and lead were better separated on the alloy electrodes compared to pure silver electrodes. Measure-ments of nickel were carried out on alloy electrodes by use of adsorptive differential pulse cathodic stripping voltam-metry (Ad-DPCSV), and good linearity (r 2 = 1. 000) was found in the range from 0. 5 to 5 ppb with an adsorption time of 120 s. The alloy electrodes were also found to be sensitive to nitrate, and good linearity (r 2 = 0. 997) was found in the range from 1 mg L − 1 to 100 mg L − 1 using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) scanning from − 450 mV to − 1, 500 mV.

The jet's axisymmetric mode is excited at the nozzle lip through a sinusoidal modulation of the flow rate at amplitudes ranging from 0. 1 % to 100 %. The instantaneous flow field is measured via particle image velocimetry and decomposed into a mean and periodic part utilizing proper orthogonal decomposition. Local linear stability analysis {{is applied to}} the measured mean flow adopting a weakly nonparallel flow approach. The resulting global perturbation field is carefully compared to the measurements in terms of spatial growth rate, phase velocity, and phase and amplitude distribution. It is shown that the stability wave model accurately predicts the excited flow oscillations during their entire growth phase and during a large part of their decay phase. The stability wave model applies over a wide range of forcing amplitudes, showing no pronounced sensitivity to the strength of nonlinear saturation. The upstream displacement of the neutral point and <b>the</b> <b>successive</b> <b>reduction</b> of gain with increasing forcing amplitude is very well captured by the stability wave model. At very strong forcing (> 40 %), the flow becomes essentially stable to the axisymmetric mode. For these extreme cases, the prediction deteriorates from the measurements due to an interaction of the forced wave with the geometric confinement of the nozzle. Moreover, the model fails far downstream in a region where energy is transferred from the oscillation back to the mean flow. This study supports previously conducted mean flow stability analysis of self-excited flow oscillations in the cylinder wake and in the vortex breakdown bubble and extends the methodology to externally forced convectively unstable flows.
