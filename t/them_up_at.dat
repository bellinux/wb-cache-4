5|$|On 2 September 2013 on Raw, Cody Rhodes {{was fired}} from the WWE after failing to defeat the WWE Champion Randy Orton, a non-title match into which Rhodes was forced after he {{questioned}} the company's chief operating officer Triple H's authoritarian rule. Goldust returned the following week and similarly lost to Orton in a non-title match, thus failing to get his half-brother rehired. Eventually, their father Dusty Rhodes returned to Raw {{in an attempt to}} convince Stephanie McMahon to give his sons their jobs back. Instead, McMahon propositioned that Dusty could choose either one of his sons to receive a job, but not both. Dusty refused and Big Show knocked out Dusty as per McMahon's orders. In return, the Rhodes Brothers ambushed Triple H's henchmen the Shield on Raw. The next week, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon (later known as the Authority) offered the brothers their jobs back if they could defeat the Shield's Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns (the WWE Tag Team Champions) at Battleground. If they lost, they would never work in WWE again and Dusty would lose his job as a trainer at the WWE Performance Center. All three members of the Rhodes family were then attacked by the Shield, including United States Champion Dean Ambrose. On October 6 at Battleground, the Rhodes Brothers made their debut match as a tag team with Dusty backing <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> ringside. Ambrose attempted to interfere, and was taken out by Dusty. Soon after, Cody pinned Rollins in the non-title match to earn the brothers' jobs back. Various WWE wrestlers and agents came out to celebrate with the Rhodes family, including Arn Anderson, Dean Malenko, and Dave Finlay.|$|E
5|$|With {{the start}} of the fire preparation, tank hunting detachments—groups of ten {{equipped}} with RPG-7 rockets, RPG-43 grenades, and AT-3 Sagger missiles—crossed the canal to deploy one kilometer deep, quickly occupying the tank ramparts, and proceeded to set up ambushes and lay mines. When the first barrage ended, Egyptian artillery began a second, 22 minute-long barrage, against targets at a depth of 1.5–3kilometers. At this time, 14:20, the first wave of assault infantry, 4,000 men, began crossing the canal. Around 2,500 dinghies and wooden boats were used to transport the troops. Smoke canisters were used at the crossing points to provide cover. During the night of October 5, engineers had blocked the underwater pipes on the opposite bank, preventing the Israelis from releasing flammable oil into the canal and igniting it. The first wave was lightly equipped, armed with RPG-7s, Strela 2 AA missiles and rope ladders to deploy on the sand wall. Among the first wave were combat engineers and several units of Sa'iqa (lightning; these were commando forces), who were tasked with setting up ambushes on reinforcement routes. The Sa'iqa attacked command posts and artillery batteries in order to deny the Israelis control over their forces, while the engineers breached the minefields and barbed wire surrounding Israeli defenses. Immediately following them, military engineers transported the water pumps to the opposite bank and began setting <b>them</b> <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> this time Egyptian aircraft involved in the air strike began returning. Five aircraft were lost, although {{by the end of the}} day this rose to ten. The air strike put the Bir Gifgafa and Bir Thamada air bases out of operation for 48 hours, and damaged the Ras Nasrani and Bir Hasanah airbases. Around ten HAWK batteries, at least two 175mm artillery batteries, an electronic jamming center at Umm Khashib, and various radar stations were destroyed. This allowed the Egyptian Air Force to operate for the rest of the war without any ground-based communications interference, as the only other jamming center in the Sinai was located at el-Arish, considerably behind the front. Over a dozen AS-5 Kelt missiles were fired from Tu-16 bombers as well. Several were shot down, but at least five hit their targets, including two missiles fitted with anti-radiation seekers that knocked out Israeli radars. The success of the air strike caused the Egyptians to cancel a planned second air strike. Another account however states that 18 Egyptian aircraft were lost, and these losses prompted the canceling of a second wave of airstrikes.|$|E

25|$|In summer 1933, Essinger {{arrived in}} England with the 13 pupils {{prohibited}} {{from taking the}} abitur (schooling completion exam). She set <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Bunce Court, where they had {{just a few weeks}} to prepare for a British matriculation exam; nine of them passed. In autumn 1933, three different groups of children and staff set out on an educational trip for the Netherlands, leaving from the south, the north and the east of Germany. Anna Essinger boarded a train with one group; her sister Paula took a group through Switzerland, where they picked up two pupils who had been on vacation with their mother. All three groups arrived on the ferry in Dover and were picked up in red buses and brought to Kent, where classes began the next day. In addition, there were three children from a Berlin family fleeing Germany that had pre-arranged for their children to meet the ferry and continue on to the school.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, Ryu Hayabusa is {{approached}} by Hayate and joins him and Ayane. Helena informs {{them that the}} Phase Four will see a mass production of Kasumi clones to sell them to top militaries in the world. Feeling {{that something is wrong}} with Kasumi, Hayate orders Ayane to follow her and discover her real intentions. Frustrated with her failure to track down Alpha, Kasumi returns to Helena, demanding to be told the truth, and Helena directs her to the platform. There, Hayate wins the right to follow her from Bayman. Kasumi discovers the lab, with Alpha-152 in it, and appears to destroy her clone. However, she is then attacked and mortally wounded by Hayate and Ayane, and dies in Ryu's arms. This Kasumi is revealed to be merely a clone herself, but Ryu regrets her death anyway. Ryu destroys attacking helicopters (of the kind that attacked the rig earlier), while Hayate is captured in the lab by Rig, who turns out to be working with Donovan. Ryu sends a falcon with a message for the true Kasumi, who has been sheltering with Murumasa all that time; she immediately joins <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the platform. In the lab, they defeat Rig, who escapes after saying it was a plan to lure them there. Lisa, dismayed to find out that Project Epsilon has been reactivated, frees Hayate. Alpha-152 then appears, taking forms of not only Kasumi but also of Hayate and Ryu, but Hayate and Ayane, Ryu and ultimately Kasumi succeed in destroying her along with the lab.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} morning of 2 November, Diệm agreed to surrender. The ARVN {{officers}} had intended to exile Diệm and Nhu, having promised the Ngô brothers safe passage out of the country. At 06:00, just before dawn, the officers held a meeting at JGS headquarters to discuss {{the fate of the}} Ngô brothers. According to Lucien Conein, the US Army officer and CIA operative who was the American liaison with the coup, most of the officers, including Minh, wanted Diệm to have an [...] "honorable retirement" [...] from office, followed by exile. Not all of the senior officers attended the meeting, with [...] having already left to make arrangements for the arrival of Diệm and Nhu at JGS headquarters. General Lê, a former police chief under Diệm in the mid-1950s, strongly lobbied for Diệm's execution. There was no formal vote taken at the meeting, and Lê attracted only minority support. One general was reported to have said [...] "To kill weeds, you must pull <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the roots". Conein reported that the generals had never indicated that assassination was in their minds, since an orderly transition of power was a high priority in achieving their ultimate aim of gaining international recognition.|$|E
500|$|On the October 25 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Natalya competed against Bella in a losing {{effort to be}} {{the captain of the}} SmackDown women's team at the Survivor Series pay-per-view. At Survivor Series, she {{replaced}} Bella in the traditional elimination tag team match against Team Raw after Bella was mysteriously attacked backstage, where Natalya's team was defeated. At the [...] pay-per-view, Carmella revealed that Natalya was Bella's attacker at Survivor Series, which Natalya later denied. After weeks of denying these accusations, on the December 20 episode of SmackDown, Natalya attacked Carmella and admitted to being Bella's attacker, revealing her pent-up jealousy of Bella's success over the years. Natalya and Bella were set to compete in a match on the January 10, 2017, episode of SmackDown, but the match never officially started due a brawl between the two, where referees came in to break <b>them</b> <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> the Royal Rumble pay-per-view on January 29, Natalya competed in a six-woman tag team match alongside Bliss and Mickie James against Bella, Naomi, and Lynch, where her team was defeated after Naomi pinned Bliss. On February 12 at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, Natalya faced Bella in singles competition, which ended in a double count-out. The feud culminated in a Falls Count Anywhere match on the February 21 episode of SmackDown, where Natalya defeated Bella after an interference from Maryse.|$|E
