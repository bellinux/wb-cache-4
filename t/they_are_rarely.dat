5|$|Leaves : Simple, entire (smooth and even), linear, oval to {{filiform}} (thread-like), {{mostly with}} parallel veins, but occasionally net-veined. They are alternate (single and alternating direction) and spiral, {{but may be}} whorled (three or more attached at one node, e.g. Lilium, Fritillaria), cauline (arranged along the aerial stem) or sheathed in a basal rosette. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> petiolate (stem attached before apex), and lack stipules. The aerial stem is unbranched.|$|E
5|$|Its hairless, splotchy gray or gray-brown skin {{falls in}} folds to the shoulder, back and rump. The skin has a natural mosaic pattern, which lends the rhino an armored appearance. The neck {{folds of the}} Javan {{rhinoceros}} are smaller {{than those of the}} Indian rhinoceros, but still form a saddle shape over the shoulder. Because of the risks of interfering with such an endangered species, however, the Javan rhinoceros is primarily studied through fecal sampling and camera traps. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> encountered, observed or measured directly.|$|E

50|$|The {{limited number}} of these heavy tanks, plus their {{specialized}} role in either offensive or defensive missions, meant <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> permanently assigned to a single division or corps; but shuffled around according to war circumstances.|$|R
50|$|From 1968, the SB series used {{computer}} classification codes from Bedford's parent company General Motors, with the petrol-engined SB3 variant becoming NFM, and the diesel-engined SB5 variant becoming NJM. However, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> referred to under these codes.|$|R
5|$|Mole crickets are {{relatively}} common, {{but because they}} are nocturnal and spend nearly all their lives underground in extensive tunnel systems, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> seen. They inhabit agricultural fields and grassy areas. They are present in every continent with the exception of Antarctica; by 2014, one hundred and seven species had been described and more species are likely to be discovered, especially in Asia. Neoscapteriscus didactylus is a widespread pest species, originating in South America it has spread to the West Indies and New South Wales in Australia. Gryllotalpa africana is a major pest in South Africa; other Gryllotalpa species are widely distributed in Europe, Asia and Australia. They are native to Britain (as to western Europe), but the former population of G. gryllotalpa may now be extinct in mainland Britain, surviving in the Channel Islands.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the tombs}} are {{not open to}} the public (18 of the tombs can be opened, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> open at the same time), and {{officials}} occasionally close those that are open for restoration work. The number of visitors to KV62 has led to a separate charge for entry into the tomb. The West Valley has only one open tomb—that of Ay—and a separate ticket is needed to visit this tomb. The tour guides are no longer allowed to lecture inside the tombs, and visitors are expected to proceed quietly and in single file through the tombs. This is to minimize time in the tombs and prevent the crowds from damaging the surfaces of the decoration. Photography is no longer allowed in the tombs.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{of giant}} mouse lemurs include the Madagascar buzzard, Madagascar owl, fossa, and the narrow-striped mongoose. Giant mouse lemurs {{reproduce}} once a year, with two offspring born after a 90-day gestation. Babies are initially {{left in the}} nest while the mother forages, but are later carried by mouth and parked in vegetation while she forages nearby. In captivity, giant mouse lemurs will breed year-round. Their lifespan in the wild {{is thought to be}} five to six years. Both species are listed as endangered due to habitat destruction and hunting. Like all lemurs, they are protected under CITES Appendix I, which prohibits commercial trade. Despite breeding easily, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> kept in captivity. The Duke Lemur Center coordinated the captive breeding of an imported collection of the northern species, which rose from six individuals in 1982 to 62individuals by 1989, but the population fell to six by 2009 and was no longer considered a breeding population.|$|E
5000|$|Brodszky was a tunesmith {{who always}} needed {{the help of}} arrangers and assistants to turn his ideas into {{finished}} compositions. These assistants included Roy Douglas, Mischa Spoliansky and Charles Williams, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> credited. Lionel Salter termed Brodszky a 'near-illiterate.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Regardless of {{prescriptive}} or orthographical concerns, types {{for capital}} ß were designed in various typefaces in the 1920s and 1930s even though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> used.

50|$|Portsmouth won the Division One title by some distance, passing manager Harry Redknapp's old club, West Ham, on the {{way down}} and ending their own 15-year exile from the top flight. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> outside the top two at any point of the season.|$|R
5|$|The {{forewings}} {{are short}} oblong leathery plates {{used to cover}} the hindwings like the elytra of a beetle, rather than to fly. Most species have short and leather-like forewings with very thin hindwings, though species in the former suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina (epizoic species, sometimes considered as ectoparasites) are wingless and blind with filiform segmented cerci (today these are both included merely as families in the suborder Neodermaptera). The hindwing is a very thin membrane that expands like a fan, radiating from one point folded under the forewing. Even though most earwigs have wings and are capable of flight, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> seen in flight. These wings are unique in venation and {{in the pattern of}} folding that requires the use of the cerci.|$|E
5|$|Although sharks rarely bite humans, {{the tiger}} shark is {{reported}} to be responsible for a large percentage of fatal shark bite incidents, and is sometimes {{regarded as one of the}} most dangerous shark species. They often visit shallow reefs, harbors, and canals, creating the potential for encounter with humans. The tiger shark also dwells in river mouths and other runoff-rich water. While the tiger shark is considered to be one of the sharks most dangerous to humans, its bite rate is low. It is second on the list of number of recorded bites on humans, with the great white shark being first. On average, three to four shark bites occur per year in Hawaii, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> fatal. This bite rate is very low considering thousands of people swim, surf, and dive in Hawaiian waters every day. Human interactions with tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between September and November, when tiger shark females are believed to migrate to the islands to give birth.|$|E
5|$|Among Chacoan mammals are the {{plentiful}} coyote (Canis latrans); mule deer, elk, and pronghorn also {{live within}} the canyon, though <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> encountered by visitors. Important smaller carnivores include bobcats, badgers, foxes, and two species of skunk. The park hosts abundant populations of rodents, including several prairie dog towns. Small colonies of bats are present during the summer. The local shortage of water means that relatively few bird species are present; these include roadrunners, large hawks (such as Cooper's hawks and American kestrels), owls, vultures, and ravens, though they are less abundant in the canyon than in the wetter mountain ranges to the east. Sizeable populations of smaller birds, including warblers, sparrows, and house finches, are also common. Three species of hummingbirds are present: one is the tiny but highly pugnacious rufous hummingbird, which compete intensely with the more mild-tempered black-chinned hummingbirds for breeding habitat in shrubs or trees located near water. Western (prairie) rattlesnakes are occasionally seen in the backcountry, though various lizards and skinks are far more abundant.|$|E
50|$|The DB {{preferred}} to employ these two-coach sets on relatively level routes. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> used on hilly lines {{due to the}} resultant high current consumption and hence limited range. In the main this only affected those vehicles stationed at Wanne-Eickel, and which {{were used in the}} Wuppertal area.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaders of}} Nazi {{political}} districts (known as the Gauleiter) were empowered to bestow Gau Badges {{for a variety}} of services rendered to the local political organization. The badges were issued in Silver and Gold with some issuance in Bronze. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> issued in Gold with Diamonds.|$|R
50|$|Wunderlich {{refers to}} a series of vacuum tubes {{introduced}} in the early 1930s. Wunderlichs were designed to be used as full-wave detectors in AM radio receivers. However, because of their unusual design, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> used in commercially manufactured receivers. The tube is named for its inventor, Norman Wunderlich.|$|R
5|$|Unlike other Novomessor species, workers forage {{early in}} the morning and late {{afternoon}}, whereas N. cockerelli and N. albisetosus forage during the afternoon and evening. However, it is unknown whether or not these ants are active during the night. Foragers first emerge from their nests at 9 A.M. and return by 5 P.M. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> seen during the middle of the day when temperatures reach 95–100°F (35–38°C), although the ground temperature is considerably higher. Workers are commonly seen foraging between 9 and 11 A.M. and 3 to 5 P.M. Most workers forage on the ground, but sometimes they can be seen walking on low herbage without feeding on the plants or collecting any seeds. Excavated nests showed no evidence that these ants collect seeds, and no workers were seen collecting them or carrying them back to the nest. N. ensifer ants are solitary foragers that work 25 ft (7 m) away from their home nest. N. ensifer predominately feeds on insects they prey on, consuming dead insects such as ichneumon wasps, bembicine wasps and small moths. When a worker discovers a dead insect, it will start to pull and carry it back to the nest immediately, and other nestmates will join once they detect it. Workers do not cooperate with each other and pull the insect from all directions, accidentally tearing it apart. However, the workers will eventually have a piece of the insect left and return it to the nest. The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard (Phrynosoma asio). Mites and Springtail arthropods are known to dwell inside nests, but their function or purpose within a colony is unknown.|$|E
25|$|These {{birds are}} not often spotted. In the summer, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> seen {{because they are}} in such an obscure {{breeding}} location. Similarly, in the winter <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> seen because they travel too far south for many birdwatchers. Therefore, the majority of sightings occur during the spring or fall in temperate regions and are generally in small numbers around water.|$|E
25|$|Lyrics {{that were}} written by Albert Gamse are set to James Sanderson's music, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> sung.|$|E
25|$|Ents {{are similar}} in that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> expensive, <b>rarely</b> used warriors.|$|R
50|$|A choirbook {{was a major}} investment. Many of {{them were}} stark and {{utilitarian}} and show signs of heavy and constant use. At larger cathedrals choir books were sometimes lavishly decorated and illuminated. Since they represent an important expense <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> owned by single people, but rather by families or institutions.|$|R
50|$|Crinoid “arms” {{are long}} organs {{that came out}} of the crinoid ball. They {{filtered}} food particles from the water and are the rarest part of the crinoid. They looked like feathery arms, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the reason that crinoid are often called sea lilies. These arms were extremely delicate, and as a result <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> preserved.|$|R

50|$|Each mill engine {{manufacturer}} {{had their own}} style of barring engine. Unlike other smaller components, such as feed water pumps, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> bought-in from other makers. Usually, though, a standard design was used for all sizes of engine, with additional gearing if it was required to bar a particularly large engine.|$|R
50|$|During the British Raj, English Foxhounds were {{exported}} to India {{for the purpose}} of jackal coursing, though due to the comparatively hotter weather, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> long lived. Foxhounds were preferred for this purpose over greyhounds, as the former was not as fast, and could thus provide a longer, more sporting chase.|$|R
50|$|The movie The Frogmen {{also made}} this mistake, using three-cylindered aqualungs, {{including}} on its movie poster. DESCO were making three-cylinder constant flow sets that lacked the demand valve of the aqualung, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> {{used in the}} war, and the preferred system was the rebreather developed by Dr. Christian J. Lambertsen.|$|R
25|$|The first disk {{recordings}} {{were invented}} by Emile Berliner and were pressed as 7 inch approx. 78rpm recordings between 1887 and 1899. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> found today.|$|E
25|$|Supercapacitors vary {{sufficiently}} that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> interchangeable, {{especially those}} with higher specific energy. Applications range from low to high peak currents, requiring standardized test protocols.|$|E
25|$|It {{is entirely}} {{possible}} {{that there are a}} number of components not listed below, either because of oversight, because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> used, or because no simple Unicode representation for the component exists.|$|E
50|$|British sceptics started {{regarding}} {{the system as}} proof that the German pilots were {{not as good as}} their own, who they believed could do without such systems. The Butt Report proved this to be wrong; aerial reconnaissance returned photographs of the RAF bombing raids, showing that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>rarely,</b> if ever, anywhere near their targets.|$|R
