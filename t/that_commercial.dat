Meanwhile, the community station C31 received no government assistance or funding to make the transition; this still remains a source of controversy.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} calculation {{starts with}} the fact <b>that</b> <b>commercial</b> building lighting consumes in excess of 81.68 terawatts (1999 data) of electricity, according to the U.S. DOE. Thus commercial lighting alone consumes about four to five {{million barrels per day}} (equivalent) of petroleum, in line with the alternate rationale above to estimate U.S. lighting energy consumption. Even among developed countries there are large differences in patterns of light use. American cities emit 3–5 times more light to space per capita compared to German cities.|$|E
25|$|Bloom's {{critique}} of contemporary social movements {{at play in}} universities or society at large is derived from his classical and philosophical orientation.

Bloom argues <b>that</b> <b>commercial</b> pursuits had become more highly valued than love, the philosophic quest for truth, or the civilized pursuits of honor and glory.|$|E
