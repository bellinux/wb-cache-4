5|$|After the Israeli {{invasion}} of Lebanon in 1982, Israel occupied {{a strip of}} south Lebanon, which was controlled by the South Lebanon Army (SLA), a militia supported by Israel. Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass the Israeli occupation. Its leaders were followers of Ayatollah Khomeini, and its forces were trained and organized by a contingent of 1,500 Revolutionary Guards that arrived from Iran with permission from <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> <b>government,</b> which was in occupation of Lebanon at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights {{reported}} on 11 February 2013 that the dam {{was captured by}} the Syrian opposition in their fight against the government. As of December 2016 the village near the dam, Al-Thawrah, is occupied by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In 2013, four of the dam's eight turbines were operational and the original staff continued to manage the dam. Workers at the dam still received pay from <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> <b>Government</b> and fighting in the area temporarily ceased if repairs were needed. January 2017 saw a raid against ISIS by combined SDF and US special forces between the dam and nearby Al-Thawrah.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds {{of members}} of the Bosnian Muslim SS {{divisions}} volunteered to fight in the 1948–1949 Arab–Israeli War. Many were recruited by agents of al-Husayni, who achieved political leadership of the Palestinian Arabs following the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine. <b>The</b> <b>Syrian</b> <b>government</b> also made a request for the transfer of 8,000 Bosnian Muslim refugees to Syria, many for recruitment into the Syrian Armed Forces. Iraq sent representatives to Europe and invited 2,500 Bosnian Muslims to settle in their nation. Frantzman and Culibrk estimate that approximately 1,000 former Bosnian Muslim SS members fought in Palestine, but say it is possible that Bosnian Muslim participation was much more extensive. Contemporary Haganah intelligence records suggest that up to 4,000 Bosnian Muslim volunteers took part. Many of the volunteers served in the Arab Liberation Army's Ajnaddin Battalion, as well as the Army of the Holy War.|$|E

Thereafter, occasional U.S. attacks on government-aligned forces continued in what was billed as self-defence of the U.S.-led coalition-partnered forces. The U.S. move prompted Russia to announce on June 18 that it would henceforth track jets and drones of the U.S.-led coalition and halt an incident-prevention hotline with the U.S. military.|$|R

5|$|On 21 August 2013, rockets {{containing}} the chemical agent sarin struck several opposition-controlled or disputed {{areas of the}} Ghouta suburbs of Damascus, resulting {{in the death of}} more than 300 people and injury to thousands in the Ghouta chemical attack. The United States and other Western countries blamed <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> <b>government</b> for the attacks, while Syria blamed civil war opposition forces. In response to Ghouta, a coalition of countries led by the United States and France, which support the rebels, threatened air strikes on Syria. Russia, a key ally of Syria, along with China had earlier blocked efforts by the United States, France, and the UK to secure United Nations Security Council approval for military intervention. The United States and France headed a coalition of countries on the verge of carrying out air strikes on Syria.|$|E
5|$|Al-Razzaz, Aflaq's {{successor}} as Secretary General, {{came from}} the pro-Aflaq faction. With the defection of al-Hafez, he ordered that the National Command was the de jure ruling body of the Ba'ath Party. He appointed al-Bitar Prime Minister, Umran defence minister, Mansur al-Atrash as Chairman of the National Council of the Revolutionary Command and al-Hafiz retained his post as President of Syria. Salah Jadid, the Military Committee's strongman, responded by arresting several Umran supporters. Umran responded by dismissing a handful of pro-Jadid officials. The {{most important of these}} dismissals was the removal of Ahmad Suwaydani from the post of head of the country's military intelligence to head of the Officer Administration. On 23 February a coup d'état led by Jadid and Hafez al-Assad overthrew <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> <b>Government</b> and the Ba'ath Party leadership. Aflaq was exiled from Syria, and ordered never to return his homeland. Members of the party's other factions fled; Aflaq was captured and detained, along with other pro-Aflaq supporters, in a government guest house. When the new rulers launched a purge in August that year, Aflaq managed to make his escape, with the help of Nasim Al Safarjalani and Malek Bashour, both closely trusted friends and colleagues, and hence was able to flee to Beirut, Lebanon, and later to Brazil.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1929 there were {{suggestions}} that the castle {{should be taken}} under French control. On 16November 1933 Krak des Chevaliers was given into {{the control of the}} French state, and cared for by the Académie des Beaux-Arts. The villagers were moved and paid F1million between them in compensation. Over the following two years a programme of cleaning and restoration was carried out by a force of 120workers. Once finished, Krak des Chevaliers was one of the key tourist attractions in the French Levant. Pierre Coupel, who had undertaken similar work at the Tower of the Lions and the two castles at Sidon, supervised the work. Despite the restoration, no archaeological excavations were carried out. The French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon, which had been established in 1920, ended in 1946 with the declaration of Syrian independence. The castle was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, along with Qal’at Salah El-Din, in 2006, and is owned by <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E

5|$|Having worked {{together}} for communist {{organizations in the}} mid-1980s, Faeq al-Mir and Elias Atallah boasted a close relationship {{at the time of}} the arrest. Al-Mir, a human rights activist, led the left-wing People’s Democratic Party, an unauthorized party critical of <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> <b>government.</b> Atallah was the leader and sole parliamentarian of the Democratic Left Movement, a leftist Lebanese party. He was also a senior figure in the March 14 Alliance, a Lebanese parliamentary coalition critical of Syrian policies. The two conversed over the phone several times prior to the arrest. They often lamented the assassinations of anti-Syrian Lebanese figures like Samir Kassir. Al-Mir, who was released from a previous ten-year prison sentence related to political activism in 1999, visited Lebanon in 2006 to mourn the killing of George Hawi, a former leader of the Lebanese Communist Party. According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, this contributed to al-Mir's arrest at the end of the year.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, when Syria was a French mandate, it was {{proposed}} {{to build a}} dam in the Euphrates near the Syro–Turkish border. After Syria became independent in 1946, the feasibility of this proposal was re-investigated, but the plan was not carried out. In 1957, <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> <b>government</b> reached {{an agreement with the}} Soviet Union for technical and financial aid {{for the construction of a}} dam in the Euphrates. Syria, as part of the United Arab Republic (UAR), signed an agreement with West Germany in 1960 for a loan to finance the construction of the dam. After Syria left the UAR in 1961, a new agreement about the financing of the dam was reached with the Soviet Union in 1965. A special government department was created in 1961 to oversee the construction of the dam. In the early 1960s Swedish geomorphologist Åke Sundborg worked as advisor in the dam project with the task of estimating the amount and fate of sediments that would enter into the dam. Sundborg developed for this purpose a mathematical model on the prognosed growth of a river delta in the dam.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of Syria's chemical weapons began in September 2013 {{on the basis}} of several international agreements with Syria that stipulated an initial destruction deadline of 30 June 2014. United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118 of 27 September 2013 required Syria to assume responsibility for and follow a timeline for the {{destruction of}} its chemical weapons and its chemical weapon production facilities. The resolution bound Syria to the implementation plan presented in a decision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). On 23 June 2014, the last declared chemical weapons were shipped out of Syria for destruction. The destruction of the most dangerous chemical weapons was performed at sea aboard the Cape Ray, a vessel of the United States Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force, crewed with U.S. civilian merchant mariners. The actual destruction operations, performed by a team of U.S. Army civilians and contractors, destroyed 600 metric tons of chemical agents in 42 days. However, despite these efforts, the use of chemical weapons in Syria have continued to be reported, with the latest being the chemical attack on Khan Shaykhun in April 2017, which has been alleged to have been perpetrated by <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E

An IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Center database analysis confirmed that only 6% of Syrian government forces attacks were targeted at ISIL from January to November 2014, while {{in the same period}} only 13% of all ISIL attacks targeted government forces. The National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces has stated that <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> <b>government</b> has operatives inside ISIL, as has the leadership of Ahrar ash-Sham.
