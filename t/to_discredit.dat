5|$|Beauchamp's {{defense team}} {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>discredit</b> Patrick Darby by stressing {{his association with}} the Old Court and suggesting the murder was politically motivated. They also presented witnesses who testified that they knew of no hostility between Beauchamp and Sharp, and questioned whether Darby and Beauchamp's 1824 meeting ever occurred.|$|E
5|$|Lavoisier {{conducted}} the first adequate quantitative experiments on oxidation {{and gave the}} first correct explanation of how combustion works. He used these and similar experiments, all started in 1774, <b>to</b> <b>discredit</b> the phlogiston theory and {{to prove that the}} substance discovered by Priestley and Scheele was a chemical element.|$|E

50|$|Because the Vice is aggressively tied to Catholicism {{from the}} outset of the play, when the Vice is reprimanded and damned, so are his Catholic beliefs.

2500|$|The {{rejection}} of Semmelweis's empirical observations is often traced to belief perseverance, the psychological tendency of clinging <b>to</b> <b>discredited</b> beliefs.

5|$|During closing arguments, {{defense counsel}} John Pope {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>discredit</b> Darby; the latter reacted by assaulting one of Pope's co-counselors with a cane. The trial lasted thirteen days, {{and despite the}} absence of any physical evidence, including a murder weapon, the jury returned a guilty verdict after only an hour of deliberation on May 19. Beauchamp was sentenced to be executed by hanging on June 16, 1826.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald died in 640, and {{according}} to most versions of the Kentish Royal Legend was succeeded solely by his son Eorcenberht. However, an early text (Caligula A.xiv) refers to Eormenred as 'king', suggesting either he was a junior king under Eorcenberht, or had a shared kingship. One suggestion is that the some other version {{of events in the}} 'legend', which give him no title, may have been an attempt <b>to</b> <b>discredit</b> royal claimants from Eormenred's line.|$|E

5|$|On February 28, Garza's {{half-brother}} Moya {{testified against}} him and said Garza admitted he had received US$3,000 for Fischer's murder {{while he was in}} Brownsville. Garza's defense tried <b>to</b> <b>discredit</b> Moya's statements by saying he was facing drug offenses in Dallas, and was cooperating with prosecutors by testifying against Garza to receive a reduced sentence. Moya denied such arrangements were in place. He said the gun used at the murder scene was bought in Dallas while he was there, and he remembered seeing it in Garza's home in San Antonio. Records from the gun shop in Dallas showed Garza bought the same type of gun on February 1, 1993. In addition, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigator testified he helped record the suspect's conversations, while a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) technician helped improve the clarity of the tapes. The defense attorneys brought in experts <b>to</b> <b>discredit</b> the recordings, and to prove they had been tampered with.|$|E
5|$|The {{real purpose}} of Đôn asking for martial law was to {{maneuver}} troops in readiness for a coup, {{and he had}} no concrete plans to send the regular army into the pagodas. Nhu sidestepped him and took the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>discredit</b> the army by using Tung's Special Forces and the combat police to attack the pagodas. Đính, the officer most trusted by the Ngô family, was the only general who was given advance notice of the raids.|$|E
5|$|The site {{is known}} for its use of Internet memes, which have been likened to the imageboard 4chan and cited as attractions for a younger and more ideologically diverse audience.

5|$|White South African {{critics of}} apartheid, such as liberal {{politician}} Alex Boraine and Afrikaner anti-apartheid activist Beyers Naudé, were labelled unpatriotic Boerehaters by Nationalists and the Afrikaans press {{in an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>discredit</b> them. White dissidents were also associated with the rooi gevaar ("communist threat"). South African poet and writer Guy Butler was called a Boerehater by Afrikaners for his promotion of English-language literature and his opposition to Afrikaner nationalism and the National Party.|$|E
5|$|A major {{corrective}} opportunity {{this year}} involved the rerelease {{of one of}} the earliest malicious biographies of Mrs. Eddy, The Life of Mary Baker G.

The current publisher, after much correspondence with our office, instead issued a statement accurately characterizing its bias. The book has received almost no attention in the public, proving if Truth isn't spoken, nothing is said.|$|E
5|$|An {{internal}} {{attempt was}} made <b>to</b> <b>discredit</b> Gomułka's leadership, but there were aspects of the ongoing witch hunt which he found to be to his advantage and he tolerated it until the societal damage wrecked by the Moczar movement had become irreversible. Gomułka's regime reasserted itself and was saved {{by a combination of}} international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus. The Soviet Union, now led by Leonid Brezhnev, was preoccupied with the crisis in Czechoslovakia and not inclined to support personal changes in the Polish leadership.|$|E

5|$|Charles Cardell (1892–1977) was {{the founder}} of a Pagan Witchcraft {{tradition}} that rivalled that of Gerald Gardner's in southern England during the 1950s. A psychologist and stage conjurer, Cardell ran a company named Dumblecott Magick Productions {{from his home in}} Charlwood, Surrey, from where he also controlled a local coven that was spied on by the press, leading to a well-publicised court case. Having been involved with Spiritualism as well as Pagan Witchcraft, Cardell initially befriended Gardner, but in 1958 they had an argument, and in 1964 Cardell tried <b>to</b> <b>discredit</b> him by publishing much of the then-secret Gardnerian Book of Shadows.|$|E

5|$|He {{drew from}} his medical {{training}} <b>to</b> <b>discredit</b> popular ideas about {{differences among the}} races. In 1843 he gave a lecture series, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Races, to demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so-called scientific practice {{of the time that}} was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. He rejected the practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E

After Sékou Touré convinced Nkrumah to support the secessionist Sanwi in Côte d'Ivoire, Houphouët-Boigny began a campaign <b>to</b> <b>discredit</b> the Ghanaian regime. He accused Nkrumah of trying to destabilise Côte d'Ivoire in 1963, and called for the Francophone states to boycott the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) conference scheduled {{to take place in}} Accra. Nkrumah was ousted from power in 1966 in a military coup; Houphouët-Boigny allowed the conspirators to use Côte d'Ivoire as a base to coordinate the arrival and departure of their missions.|$|E
