However, with the onset of the global financial crisis and recession, <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> economy may experience a dramatic reorganization and even decline. Given the attention many cities place on <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>sectors</b> it is important to examine how they fare following this major economic event. To do so, this article examines the occupational distribution and geographic structure of <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> economy in <b>the</b> 30 largest US metropolitan areas during recession and captures the changes that have occurred over the last decade. Based on this analysis, we identify a set of key trends, which highlight that while the boom period is generally characterized by widespread and, in some places, extreme growth in <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>sectors,</b> <b>the</b> recession is a period of selective growth and not a period of total decline. These findings have implications for determining the relevance of <b>the</b> arts and <b>cultural</b> <b>sectors</b> as targets of urban economic development policy in the post-recession era...|$|R
