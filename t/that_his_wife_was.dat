5|$|Arriving in Colorado, McDonald {{found himself}} at the centre of another power struggle. Sympathetic to the fact <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>was</b> {{less than two weeks}} away from giving birth, head coach Don Cherry gave McDonald {{permission}} to leave the team on off-days to return to his wife in Toronto. But he did so without gaining the approval of general manager Ray Miron, who disagreed frequently with Cherry and fired him following the season. On the ice, McDonald scored 35goals with the Rockies and finished with a total of 40 between the two teams.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, Anna Eliza Corwin {{divorced}} Brannan. They {{had grown}} apart as Eliza lived in Europe {{for quite some}} time while Brannan remained in California. Because of the divorce he lost much of his personal fortune, as it was ruled <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>was</b> entitled to half of their holdings, payable in cash. Because the vast majority of Brannan's holdings were in real estate, he had to liquidate the properties to pay the full divorce settlement.|$|E
5|$|MacBride married {{early in}} his career, but no details are known, other than <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>was</b> the {{daughter}} of a naval officer. She is presumed to have died, for MacBride married Ursula Folkes, eldest daughter of William Folkes of Hillington Hall, Norfolk on 14 July 1774. Their son, John David MacBride, became principal of Magdalen Hall, Oxford. MacBride's daughter, Charlotte, married Admiral Willoughby Lake in 1795.|$|E

5|$|All {{accounts}} {{agree that}} Pain married in 1115 and <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>was</b> named Sybil, although {{the identity of}} Sybil's parents is unclear. Pain's Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry states that he married Sybil Talbot, the niece of Hugh de Lacy. The Complete Peerage states that he married Sybil, the daughter of Geoffrey Talbot and Talbot's wife Agnes, who was herself probably the daughter of Walter de Lacy. The historian K. S. B. Keats-Rohan states that Pain married Sybil de Lacy, the daughter of Hugh de Lacy, a view shared by fellow historians Judith Green and Paul Dalton. Others such as Bruce Coplestone-Crow and David Crouch agree with the Oxford Dictionary of National Biographys designation of Sybil as Hugh's niece, and daughter of Geoffrey Talbot and Agnes, the sister of Hugh de Lacy.|$|E
5|$|Rosebery's {{frequent}} absences {{from his}} wife fuelled gossip {{that he was a}} secret homosexual. It has been claimed that the inscrutable air that Rosebery wore was a mask to disguise his secret homosexual life. The worry of this illegal secret, it was claimed, and fear of exposure, caused his insomnia and bouts of depression. It was even whispered that his Barnbougle Castle retreat was really a venue for clandestine assignations with young men. Rosebery's possible homosexuality has been much discussed in recent times. Nothing conclusive has ever been found one way or the other, but it is possible that he had homosexual experiences while in the care of a paedophile housemaster at Eton in his youth. No evidence exists <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>was</b> aware of these rumours against her husband, or even that she would have understood them, bearing in mind her sheltered upbringing and limited education. Sex education was not part of a 19th-century upper-class girl's schooling. The more public and precise accusations of Rosebery's homosexuality by the Marquess of Queensberry did not occur until three years after Lady Rosebery's death.|$|E
5|$|In Bethany, Vermont, a raven frightens {{a little}} girl, Michelle Crittendon, at a park while a neighbor, Jenny Uphouse, watches. The bird is later found at her home. Her mother, Martha Crittendon, is then {{attacked}} {{and killed by}} an unseen monster. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are on a stakeout looking {{for a woman who}} is possibly killing prostitutes. Mulder believes she has the power to disappear because every time police attempt to arrest her she cannot be found. While on lookout, Mulder gets a call about the attack and leaves. Back at the office, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) tells Mulder that Crittendon disappeared and asks him what he knows about ravens. Mulder believes that the bird is usually associated with evil. Skinner tells Mulder that this case is a top priority because Crittendon is the wife of a powerful judge. At the Crittendon home, Martha's husband, Howard, tells Mulder <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>was</b> cheating on him because he found birth control pills, which is suspicious because Howard has had a vasectomy. Another neighbor, Ellen Adderly, the wife of Sheriff Phil Adderly, is approached by Jenny and then sees a raven before the window of a nearby car shatters. At the Crittendon home, Michelle sees the raven outside her window again and Howard leaves to check it out, leading him to find a hand sticking out above the flower bushes. Later the police dig up Martha's body, with claw marks all over her face.|$|E

5|$|Wheelbarrow: The {{earliest}} wheelbarrows with {{archaeological evidence}} {{in the form of}} a one-wheel cart come from 2nd century Han Dynasty Emperor Hui's tomb murals and brick tomb reliefs. The painted tomb mural of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in a tomb at Chengdu, Sichuan province, dated precisely to 118 CE. The stone carved relief of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in the tomb of Shen Fujun in Sichuan province, dated circa 150 CE. And then there is the story of the pious Dong Yuan pushing his father around in a single-wheel lu che barrow, depicted in a mural of the Wu Liang tomb-shrine of Shandong (dated to 147 CE). However, there are even earlier accounts than this that date back to the 1st century BCE and 1st century CE. The 5th century Book of Later Han stated that the wife of the once poor and youthful imperial censor Bao Xuan helped him push a lu che back to his village during their feeble wedding ceremony, around 30 BCE. Later, during the Red Eyebrows Rebellion (c. 20 CE) against Xin dynasty's Wang Mang (45 BCE23 CE), the official Zhao Xi saved his wife from danger by disguising himself and pushing her along in his lu che barrow, past a group of brigand rebels who questioned him, and allowed him to pass after he convinced them <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>was</b> terribly ill.|$|E

25|$|On April 16—one {{day after}} the Braintree robbery-murders—the Federal Immigration Service (FIS) called Chief Stewart to discuss Galleanist and anarchist Coacci, whom Stewart had arrested on their behalf two years earlier.

The FIS asked Stewart to investigate Coacci's excuse for failing to report for deportation on April 15. On April 16, officers discovered Coacci at home and determined that he had given a false alibi for not showing up for deportation. They offered him another week, but Coacci declined and left for Italy on April 18, 1920.|$|E
25|$|Christie {{was asked}} {{to go to the}} hotel to {{identify}} his wife. She apparently did not recognise him until later, when she was recovering at her sister's house, Abney Hall. Christie issued a statement to the press saying <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>was</b> suffering from a nervous disorder and that she had complete loss of memory. The 1979 dramatic film Agatha was based on this event with Agatha and Archie portrayed by Vanessa Redgrave and Timothy Dalton. After this, the couple separated. Agatha went to live in a flat in London, and Christie remained at Styles so that he could sell it. In 1928, Christie married Nancy Neele in St George's, Hanover Square, with just a few close friends present at the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Despite Beckham's {{achievements}} in the 1998–99 season, {{he was still}} unpopular among some opposition fans and journalists, and he was criticised after being sent off for a deliberate foul in Manchester United's World Club Championship match against Necaxa. It was suggested in the press <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>was</b> a bad influence on him, and {{that it might be}} in United's interests to sell him, but his manager publicly backed him and he stayed at the club. During the 1999–2000 season, there was a talk of a transfer to Juventus in Italy, but this never happened. Beckham helped United retain the Premier League title in 1999–2000 by an 18-point margin – after being pushed by Arsenal and Leeds United for much of the season. United won their final 11 league games of the season, with Beckham scoring five goals during this run, with his last goal coming from a swerving shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area in their final home game against Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E

25|$|After Ryan {{was sentenced}} to Pentridge Prison, he was placed in B Division where he met fellow {{prisoner}} Peter John Walker (who was serving a 12-year sentence for bank robbery). When Ryan was informed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>was</b> seeking a divorce, he made a plan to escape from prison. Walker decided {{to go along with}} him. Ryan planned to take himself and his family and flee to Brazil, which did not have an extradition treaty with Australia. At around 2:07pm on Sunday, 19 December 1965, Ryan and Walker put the escape plan into effect. As prison officers were taking turns attending a staff Christmas party in the officers' mess hall, Ryan and Walker scaled a five-metre prison wall with the aid of two wooden benches, a hook and blankets. Running {{along the top of the}} wall to a prison watch tower, they overpowered prison warder Helmut Lange and took his M1 carbine rifle. Ryan threatened Lange and demanded he pull the lever to open the prison tower gate. Lange, however, deliberately pulled the wrong lever. Ryan, Walker and Lange then proceeded down the steps to the tower gate, but it would not open. At the bottom of the stairs was the night officers' lodge. Warder Fred Brown was returning from lunch to relieve Lange when he was confronted by the escapees. Brown did not resist. When Ryan realised Lange had tricked him, he jabbed the rifle into Lange's back and marched him back up the stairs so Lange could pull the correct lever to open the tower gate. The two escapees then exited through the gate into the prison car park. To the escapees' dismay there were only two cars in the car park and one had a flat tyre.|$|E
