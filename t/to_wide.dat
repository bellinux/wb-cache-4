5|$|After Tech's kickoff, Air Force went {{three and}} out {{and was forced to}} punt. The Hokies took over at their 34-yard line after the kick. Bryan Randall {{completed}} two quick passes <b>to</b> <b>wide</b> receiver Shawn Witten for a total of 26yards before time in the quarter ran out. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, Air Force had a 10–7 lead, but Virginia Tech was in possession of the ball and driving deeper into Air Force territory.|$|E

The motor launches ML 802 and ML 827 remained at Jacquinot Bay and conducted patrols {{along the south}} coast of the island in search of Japanese barges. ML 827 ran aground during a patrol on 17 November, and sank three days later while under tow to an Allied base; all of her crew survived. A Japanese air raid was conducted against Jacquinot Bay on 23 November.|$|E

On 4th-and-1 from the Virginia Tech 30-yard line, Ryan attempted a pass that fell incomplete, turning {{the ball over}} on downs. As a result of pressure applied by the Boston College defense, the Hokies continued to have difficulty moving the ball.|$|E

On September 16, 2007, Favre and the Packers defeated the New York Giants to give Favre his record setting 149th win, passing John Elway. On September 30, Favre threw a 16-yard touchdown pass <b>to</b> <b>wide</b> receiver Greg Jennings in a game against the Vikings. This was his 421st NFL touchdown pass, and set a new all-time record, surpassing Dan Marino's 420.|$|E
5|$|From their one-yard line, the Hurricanes ran a short rush up the middle, then Kelly {{connected}} on a 28-yard pass {{to tight}} end Mark Cooper {{for a first}} down. Three short rushes by fullback Speedy Neal resulted in 12 yards and a first down. With time running out in the quarter, Kelly attempted and completed a 27-yard pass <b>to</b> <b>wide</b> receiver Rocky Belk, driving the Hurricanes to the Tech 30-yard line and bringing the quarter to an end.

In addition, Favre completed an 81-yard touchdown pass <b>to</b> <b>wide</b> receiver Antonio Freeman {{in the second quarter}} (then a Super Bowl record for longest touchdown catch). Favre rushed for 12yards and another touchdown, as the Packers won Super Bowl XXXI over the New England Patriots, 35–21. In their 19 games of the season, the Packers had a turnover ratio of plus 24, and outscored their opponents 100–48 in the playoffs.

5|$|In {{the third}} {{game of the}} 1992 season, Majkowski injured a {{ligament}} in his ankle against the Cincinnati Bengals, an injury severe enough {{that he would be}} out for four weeks. Favre replaced Majkowski {{for the remainder of the}} game. Favre fumbled four times during the course of the game, a performance poor enough that the crowd chanted for Favre to be removed in favor of another Packers backup quarterback at the time, Ty Detmer. However, down 23–17 with 1:07 left in the game, the Packers started an offensive series on their own 8-yard line. Favre then completed a 42-yard pass <b>to</b> <b>wide</b> receiver Sterling Sharpe. Three plays later, Favre threw the game–winning touchdown pass <b>to</b> <b>wide</b> receiver Kitrick Taylor with 13 seconds remaining.|$|E

Expected to start, Kolb had a decent preseason debut for the Cardinals in preseason play against the Oakland Raiders, going 4-for-7 for 68yards; among the four completions was a 43-yard pass <b>to</b> <b>wide</b> receiver Larry Fitzgerald.|$|E
5|$|On Tech's first {{offensive}} {{play of the}} game, a pass by Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller was dropped. During {{the next}} play, Tech picked up four yards on a running play.

Texas returned the kick to its 22-yard line, and with 11:49 remaining in the quarter, the Longhorns began their second possession of the game.|$|E
