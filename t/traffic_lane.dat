5|$|Exxon Valdez {{departed}} {{the port}} of Valdez, Alaska at 9:12 p.m. March 23, 1989 with 53 million gallons of crude oil bound for California. A harbor pilot guided the ship through the Valdez Narrows before departing the ship and returning control to Hazelwood, the ship's master. The ship maneuvered out of the outbound <b>traffic</b> <b>lane</b> in the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) to avoid icebergs. Following the maneuver and sometime after 11 p.m., Hazelwood departed the navigation bridge and was in his stateroom {{at the time of}} the accident.|$|E
5|$|He left Third Mate Gregory Cousins {{in charge}} of the {{navigation}} bridge and Able Seaman Robert Kagan at the helm with instructions from the third mate to return to the southbound <b>traffic</b> <b>lane</b> in the TSS at a prearranged point. Exxon Valdez failed to return to the shipping lanes and struck Bligh Reef at around 12:04 a.m. March 24, 1989. The accident resulted in the discharge of around 11 million gallons of oil, 20% of the cargo, into Prince William Sound.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, the Department of Transportation {{looked into}} the {{expansion}} of NY347 and NY454. The studies suggested that the state would add one additional <b>traffic</b> <b>lane</b> in each direction, giving most of the highway six lanes with eight travel lanes along the concurrency in Hauppauge. The new lanes would also be capable of holding rapid-commute vehicles for the Long Island Rapid Commute. The interchange where Routes 347 and 454 fork in Hauppague is slated to go from an at-grade fork to a grade-separated interchange. The project, which will cost $359 million (2009 USD) {{was scheduled to be}} completed between 2012 and 2015.|$|E

50|$|Cycle Action Waikato {{complained in}} 2014, after the 2 <b>traffic</b> <b>lanes,</b> cycle tracks and {{footpath}} {{were converted to}} 3 <b>traffic</b> <b>lanes</b> and a footpath in 2006. The City's 1972 design brief, required up to 4 <b>traffic</b> <b>lanes.</b> The bridge carries about 200 cyclists {{a day and a}} clip-on cycle lane has been considered.|$|R
5|$|The only {{significant}} alteration {{to the structure}} of the bridge itself since the addition of the sculptures in 1907 came in 1973, when the Greater London Council (GLC) decided to add an extra <b>traffic</b> <b>lane</b> by reducing the width of the pavements. To counter the increased load of extra traffic, the council announced the replacement of the cast-iron balustrades with low box-girder structures. Despite formal objections from both Lambeth and Westminster Councils, the GLC ignored the objections. In 2015, the extra lane of motor traffic was removed in favour of a kerb-protected two-way cycle track, on the north-east side of the bridge. This forms part of Cycle Superhighway 5.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the {{southern}} regions of Perth to easier central business district access {{changed the nature of}} the metropolitan area, prompting dramatic population growth south of the river. This led to increased traffic on the bridge, causing regular traffic jams in peak hour. Over the years, governments suggested various ideas to reduce the traffic using the bridge, including introducing congestion pricing similar to that used in Singapore, charging vehicles to enter the central business district during peak periods. The government also encouraged voluntary car sharing. These efforts were largely unsuccessful, and by the 1990s, the bridge had become the city's worst traffic bottleneck, despite the addition of an extra <b>traffic</b> <b>lane,</b> bringing the total number of lanes to seven.|$|E
25|$|A bike box or an {{advanced}} stop line is a designated area {{at the head of}} a <b>traffic</b> <b>lane</b> at a signalized intersection that provides bicyclists with a safer and more visible way to get ahead of queuing traffic during the red signal phase.|$|E

25|$|The {{bridge is}} popular with {{pedestrians}} and bicyclists, and was built with walkways {{on either side}} of the six vehicle <b>traffic</b> <b>lanes.</b> Initially, they were separated from the <b>traffic</b> <b>lanes</b> by only a metal curb, but railings between the walkways and the <b>traffic</b> <b>lanes</b> were added in 2003, primarily as a measure to prevent bicyclists from falling into the roadway.|$|R
50|$|To {{accommodate}} the new Southern Suburbs Railway (now the Mandurah railway line), {{the bridge was}} widened and strengthened between 2004 and 2006. Under the new arrangement, the original bridge carries three southbound <b>traffic</b> <b>lanes</b> and the two railway tracks. The new structure carries the three northbound <b>traffic</b> <b>lanes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Right turns are {{permissible}} {{only when}} one's lane has {{the green light}} signal and the opposing <b>traffic</b> <b>lane,</b> travelling in the opposite direction, is clear and favourable to execute a right turn. However, green turning signals (the outline of a right-pointing arrow) are installed onto some traffic lights.|$|E
25|$|Motor vehicle tires {{can become}} {{permanently}} damaged if a flat {{occurs in the}} <b>traffic</b> <b>lane</b> and the driver pulls over onto the shoulder with the flat tire passing over the rumble strip.

500|$|On May 29, 2017, Woods {{was arrested}} near Jupiter, Florida by the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office at about 3:00 am EDT for {{driving under the}} {{influence}} of alcohol or drugs. He was asleep in his car, which, although running, was stopped in a <b>traffic</b> <b>lane.</b> [...] He later stated that he was taking drugs prescribed to him and did not realize how they might interact together. On July 3, 2017 Tiger tweeted that he had completed an out of state intensive program to tackle an unspecified issue. On August 9, 2017, Woods, who skipped his arraignment, entered a not guilty plea through his attorney Douglas Duncan and agreed to take part in a first time DUI offender program and hold another arraignment on October 25. At a hearing on October 27, Woods pled guilty to reckless driving. He received a year of probation, was fined $250, and ordered to undergo 50 hours of community service along with regular drug tests, and was not allowed to drink alcohol during his time of probation. If he violated his probation, he would have been sentenced to 90 days in jail with an additional $500 fine.|$|E
2500|$|A {{previous}} signal may direct {{you into}} an adjacent lane. More than one lane may be closed to traffic. If all lanes display a red cross, the motorway ahead is closed.

2500|$|In Nov. 2008 {{the current}} Council, which {{advocated}} widening the bridge, was defeated {{and replaced by}} a new mayor and Council opposed to the widening but supportive of lane reallocation from vehicles to cyclists. In late January 2009, in an economic downtown and anticipating the 2010 Winter Olympics, the City announced plans for trials of three kinds of auto <b>traffic</b> <b>lane</b> closings, allowing bicycle use of the road surface.

2500|$|In the United States and Canada, several expressways have {{a special}} lane (called an [...] "HOV Lane" [...] – High Occupancy Vehicle Lane) {{that can only be}} used by cars {{carrying}} two (some locations-three) or more people. Also, many major cities have instituted strict parking prohibitions during rush hour on major arterial streets leading to and from the central business district. During designated weekday hours, vehicles parked on these primary routes are subject to prompt ticketing and towing at owner expense. The purpose of these restrictions is to make available an additional <b>traffic</b> <b>lane</b> in order to maximize available traffic capacity. Additionally, several cities offer a public telephone service where citizens can arrange rides with others depending on where they live and work. The purpose of these policies is {{to reduce the number of}} vehicles on the roads and thus reduce rush-hour traffic intensity.|$|E
2500|$|On an April 1 show in 2008, both Dennis and Callahan {{during a}} top ten April fools prank list made mention to a prank done by Opie and Anthony that {{caused them to}} be fired from WAAF, a Boston radio station. [...] The [...] "prank" [...] which they {{referred}} to was done because Opie & Anthony hated radio April fools pranks and felt they are only done by hack radio jocks. As a result, they made five false statements and admitted 4 of them were fake except for the fifth one in which they said the mayor had died after flipping his car on a bridge, the airborne car then went over the dividing jersey barrier and landed into the oncoming <b>traffic</b> <b>lane</b> where it {{was hit by a}} tractor trailer truck. They also said there was a hooker of African American descent in the passenger seat {{at the time of the}} accident. [...] During the Dennis and Callahan segment, Dennis asked [...] "Whatever happened to those guys?" [...] Callahan then said that they were working at McDonald's with a pedophile. [...] At the time Opie & Anthony had taken over Howard Stern's syndicated terrestrial radio spot (which was heard in basically every major city in the US), and was also broadcasting at the same time on Satellite radio. This insulted Opie & Anthony, which caused them to play the Dennis & Callahan clip on their air. [...] This ended up bringing national attention to the Ryen Russillo voicemail situation and also caused WEEI to take very few callers during all their shows because of the massive volume of Opie & Anthony fans calling in for weeks to let the station know where Opie & Anthony currently worked. Callers would also complain about the comments and disrespect [...] Dennis and Callahan show for a national show and would pester on air talent by swearing or pranking them causing them to dump out of many calls.|$|E
6000|$|Now imagine, not a pistol-shot {{from these}} crowded quays, a little Office hung round with charts that are pencilled and noted over various shoals and soundings. There is a movable {{list of the}} boats at work, with quaint and {{domestic}} names. Outside the window lies the packed harbour--outside that again the line of traffic up and down--a stately cinema-show of six ships to the hour. For the moment the film sticks. A boat--probably a [...] "common sweeper"--reports an obstruction in a <b>traffic</b> <b>lane</b> a few miles away. She has found and exploded one mine. The Office heard the dull boom of it before the wireless report came in. In all likelihood there is a nest of them there. It is possible that a submarine may have got in last night between certain shoals and laid them out. The shoals are being shepherded in case she is hidden anywhere, but {{the boundaries of the}} newly discovered mine-area must be fixed and the traffic deviated. There is a tramp outside with tugs in attendance. She has hit something and is leaking badly. Where shall she go? The Office gives her her destination--the harbour is too full for her to settle down here. She swings off between the faithful tugs. Down coast some one asks by wireless if they shall hold up their traffic. It is exactly like a signaller [...] "offering" [...] a train to the next block. [...] "Yes," [...] the Office replies. [...] "Wait a while. If it's what we think, there will be a little delay. If it isn't what we think, there will be a little longer delay." [...] Meantime, sweepers are nosing round the suspected area--"looking for cuckoos' eggs," [...] as a voice suggests; and a patrol-boat lathers her way down coast to catch and stop anything that may be on the move, for skippers are sometimes rather careless. Words begin {{to drop out of the}} air into the chart-hung Office. [...] "Six and a half cables south, fifteen east" [...] of something or other. [...] "Mark it well, and tell them to work up from there," [...] is the order. [...] "Another mine exploded!" [...] "Yes, and we heard that too," [...] says the Office. [...] "What about the submarine?" [...] "Elizabeth Huggins reports...." ...|$|E
