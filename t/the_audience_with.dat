5|$|Among {{the local}} {{television}} {{stations in the}} city, TVR Cluj (public) and One TV (private) broadcast regionally, while the others are restricted to the metropolitan area. Napoca Cable Network is available through cable, and broadcasts local content throughout the day. Other stations work as affiliates of national TV stations, only providing <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> local reports {{in addition to the}} national programming. This situation is mirrored in the radio broadcasting companies: except for Radio Cluj, Radio Impuls and the Hungarian-language Paprika Rádió, all other stations are local affiliates of the national broadcasters. Casa Radio, situated on Donath Street, is one of the modern landmarks of the media and communications industry; it is, however, not the only one: Palatul Telefoanelor ("the telephone palace") is also a major modernist symbol of communications in the city centre.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August, Li and her {{teammates}} gained Singapore {{a silver medal}} in women's table tennis after losing to China in three matches. Li won {{the first game of}} her singles match, but was then defeated by her former Beijing Sports School teammate Zhang Yining. In the doubles match, China's Zhang and Guo Yue bested Singapore's Li and Wang Yuegu. This marked the first time that Singapore had won an Olympic medal since the nation's independence in 1965. The medal came 48years after Tan Howe Liang won the country's first medal, a silver in weightlifting in the lightweight category at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong requested that the live English-language broadcast of his National Day Rally speech, which coincided with the table tennis finals, be postponed by a day. He also provided <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> updates on the score, and made a conference call to Tan Eng Liang, Team Singapore's chef de mission, to congratulate the team.|$|E

In between the discovery of the clues, Steve plays a series of games — mini-puzzles — with the audience that are thematically related to the overall puzzle... As the show unfolds, Steve and Blue move from one animated set to another, jumping through magical doorways, leading viewers on a journey of discovery, until, {{at the end of the}} story, Steve returns to the living room. There, at the climax of the show, he sits down in a comfortable chair to think — a chair known, of course, in the literal world of Blue's Clues, as the Thinking Chair. He puzzles over Blue's three clues and attempts to come up with the answer.|$|E

Ben Browder and Beau Bridges joined the main cast as Lieutenant-Colonel Cameron Mitchell and Major General Hank Landry, respectively. At the same time, the producers re-introduced Vala in a six-episode story arc to cover for the maternity leave of SG-1 regular Amanda Tapping (Lieutenant-Colonel Samantha Carter). The producer intended to use Vala's unpredictability and wildcard status to break the bigger story arc and to acquaint <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> the new characters. Claudia Black wished to broaden her horizon in comedic acting and agreed to the recurring role, but declined the producers' offer of a permanent role for personal reasons.|$|E

25|$|The {{literary}} reunions {{attracted interest}} and became noisy banquets, {{the atmosphere of}} which is documented by Negruzzi's memoirs. He notes that Carp hardly ever consumed alcohol in public, but that, when he did, he was a sentimental drunk. The Junimea debates were lively and sprinkled with biting ad hominems. Young Carp casually addressed <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> the insult gogomani ("dopes"), {{and it became a}} badge of pride for the oldest Junimists to have been identified as such. The inside joke was replicated among the more minor Junimists. They casually misspelled Carp's surname as Chirp (pretending to follow the obscure lexical theories of folklorist Ioan D. Caragiani); also, during one Junimea party, novelist Nicolae Gane staged a puppet show in which Carp and Maiorescu were the main characters.|$|E

25|$|Although critic Dennis Harvey {{found the}} script full of plot holes, {{they were no}} {{more so than in}} the average slasher film.

Laura Kern found the dialogue corny, but had very positive words for the way each character was brought to life (which, she felt, made it all the more difficult to watch each person die). Critics Jeff Shannon and Peter Hartlaub also found the characters well-developed, and Hartlaub thought the performances by Dylan Fergus and Matt Phillips were the best in the film. Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Wilmington similarly enjoyed the way the film presented <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> various stereotypes (drag queen, leatherman, sex addict) and then killed them off, leaving the most fully realized character alive.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{format for}} {{contemporary}} Let's Play videos is vague, {{and at times}} may be compared or considered {{the same as a}} player completing a game via streaming video for an audience. According to Patrick Lee of The A.V. Club, a good Let's Play video distinguishes itself from straightforward streaming playthroughs when the player has sufficiently familiarized themselves with the game as to be able to offer better commentary and show off more of the game to their audience, is able to provide <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> personal recollections about the game, or can play through a game they have already completed under self-imposed challenges, such as completing a game without killing any enemy. Through this approach, Lee states, such Let's Play videos serve to help memorialize these games, helping those who may not have access to the titles (due to age or regional restrictions) to appreciate more obscure games.|$|E
