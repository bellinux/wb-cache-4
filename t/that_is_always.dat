5|$|Alan Tudyk had {{the idea}} for an episode about a planet <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> day on one side, and night on the other. On the night side, Jayne accidentally spills a type of {{pheromone}} on himself and the crew, which attracts a species of dogs. The crew are chased {{back to the ship}} by these dogs. There River uses her mind powers to domesticate the dogs.|$|E
5|$|Nelson's love {{interest}} is Destiny (Canis selfabsorbedb*tchicus), an Afghan hound. However, Destiny {{has no interest}} in Nelson. She is the pet dog of Gary (Tony Way), the landlord of The Lord Nelson. However, like the other humans that appear in the series, he cannot understand what Destiny or what the other animals are saying. Elsewhere there is Marion (Felis retardicus), an idiotic cat to whom Nelson acts as a father-figure. Marion has been abandoned by several owners and is very corruptible. Then there is Kali (Aves aggravaticus), a pigeon who likes to revel in the misfortune of others. She has several grudges, including a hatred of all humans and foxes for the way they treat birds. Lastly, there is Vince, Nelson's older brother (Vulpus c***itcus), a violent, foul-mouthed fox who considers himself a proper animal. Almost all his lines contain at least one swear word <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> bleeped over.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, a hyphen <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> {{displayed}} {{and printed}} {{is called a}} hard hyphen (although some use this term {{to refer to a}} non-breaking hyphen; see below). Soft hyphens are inserted into the text at the positions where hyphenation may occur. It can be a tedious task to insert the soft hyphens by hand, and tools using hyphenation algorithms are available that do this automatically. Current modules of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) standard provide language-specific hyphenation dictionaries.|$|E
25|$|Although their {{appearance}} varies from region to region, {{the most consistent}} features are a beak, a shell, and a plate (sara), a flat hairless region {{on the top of}} the head <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> wet, and that is regarded as the source of the kappas power. This cavity must be full whenever a kappa is away from the water; if it ever dries out, the kappa loses its power and may even die.|$|E

25|$|Polynomial {{interpolation}} can estimate local maxima and minima {{that are}} outside {{the range of the}} samples, unlike linear interpolation. For example, the interpolant above has a local maximum at x ≈ 1.566, f(x) ≈ 1.003 and a local minimum at x ≈ 4.708, f(x) ≈ −1.003. However, these maxima and minima may exceed the theoretical range of the function—for example, a function <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> positive may have an interpolant with negative values, and whose inverse therefore contains false vertical asymptotes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of a {{switched-mode}} power supply, a boost converter is inserted between the bridge rectifier and the main input capacitors. The boost converter attempts to maintain a constant DC bus voltage on its output while drawing a current <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> in phase with and at the same frequency as the line voltage. Another switched-mode converter inside the power supply produces the desired output voltage from the DC bus. This approach requires additional semiconductor switches and control electronics, but permits cheaper and smaller passive components. It is frequently used in practice.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} relative state formulation, Everett proposed {{that there is}} one universal wavefunction that describes the objective reality of the whole universe. He stated that when multiple subsystems interact, the total system becomes a superposition of these subsystems. This includes observers and measurement systems, which become part of one universal state (the wavefunction) <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> described via the Schrödinger Equation (or its relativistic alternative). That is, they become entangled such that one cannot define one without the other. Thus, each subsystems state can only be described relative to each subsystem with which it interacts (hence the name relative state).|$|E

25|$|A cricket cap {{is a type}} of soft cap, {{often made}} from felt, that is a {{traditional}} form of headwear for players of the game of cricket, regardless of age or gender. It is usually a tight-fitting skullcap, usually made of six or eight sections, with a small crescent shaped brim that points downwards over the brow to provide shade for the eyes. It is often, but not always, elasticised at the rear to hold it in place upon the wearer's head. Sometimes, rather than tight-fitting, the cricket cap comes in a baggy variety, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> kept in place by elastic.|$|E
25|$|Some {{elongated}} protists have distinctive {{ends of the}} body. In such organisms, the {{end with}} a mouth (or equivalent structure, such as the cytostome in Paramecium or Stentor), or the end that usually points {{in the direction of}} the organism's locomotion (such as the end with the flagellum in Euglena), is normally designated as the anterior end. The opposite end then becomes the posterior end. Properly, this terminology would apply only to an organism <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> planktonic (not normally attached to a surface), although the term can also be applied to one that is sessile (normally attached to a surface).|$|E
25|$|Something Wicked This Way Comes can be {{interpreted}} as an allegory of the struggle between good and evil, with the human characters Will, Jim, and Charles on the side of morality, and Mr. Dark and his carnival on the side of sin and temptation. As in many other fictional works revolving around the same concept, good prevails in the end, not with supernatural or physical powers, but with purity of heart. Jim represents good <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> on the verge of giving into temptation, while Will, though he has crises and doubts, is the part of us that resists giving in.|$|E

25|$|Dharma traditions do {{not hold}} history central to their faith. Gautama Buddha {{emphasized}} that his enlightenment was merely a discovery of a reality <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> there. He was not bringing any new covenants from any God. The history of the Buddha is not necessary for Buddhist principles to work. In fact, Buddha stated that he was neither the first nor {{the last person to}} have achieved the state of enlightenment. He also asserted that he was not God nor sent by any God as a prophet, and whatever he discovered was available to every human to discover for himself. This makes Buddhism not History-Centric.|$|E
25|$|While {{objective}} truths are {{final and}} static, subjective truths are continuing and dynamic. The truth of one's existence is a living, inward, and subjective experience <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> {{in the process}} of becoming. The values, morals, and spiritual approaches a person adopts, while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs, can only become truly known when they have been inwardly appropriated through subjective experience. Thus, Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality. As Kierkegaard claims, human truth is something that is continually occurring, and a human being cannot find truth separate from the subjective experience of one's own existing, defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one's way of life.|$|E
25|$|A {{gyroscope}} is a wheel {{mounted in}} two or three gimbals, which are a pivoted supports that allow the rotation of the wheel about a single axis. A set of three gimbals, one mounted on the other with orthogonal pivot axes, may be used to allow a wheel mounted on the innermost gimbal to have an orientation remaining independent of the orientation, in space, of its support. In the case of a gyroscope with two gimbals, the outer gimbal, which is the gyroscope frame, is mounted so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane determined by the support. This outer gimbal possesses one degree of rotational freedom and its axis possesses none. The inner gimbal is mounted in the gyroscope frame (outer gimbal) so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> perpendicular to the pivotal axis of the gyroscope frame (outer gimbal). This inner gimbal has two degrees of rotational freedom.|$|E

25|$|Advantages of {{long-term}} use include rider {{familiarity with the}} bicycle and a mode of travel <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> nearby and instantly ready for use. The bicycle can be checked out like a library book, a liability waiver can be collected at check-out, and the bike can be returned any time. A Library Bike in a person's possession can be chosen for some trips instead of a car, thus lowering car usage. The long-term rental system generally results in fewer repair costs to the scheme administrator, as riders are incentivised to obtain minor maintenance {{in order to keep}} the bike in running order during the long rental period. Most of the long-term systems implemented to date are funded solely through charitable donations of second-hand bicycles, using unpaid volunteer labour to maintain, and administer the bicycle fleet. While reducing or eliminating the need for public funding, such a scheme imposes an outer limit to program expansion. The Arcata Bike Library, in California, has loaned over 4000 bicycles using this system.|$|E

Reviewers have {{suggested}} the year 4870 AD, based on extrapolation of events in other works, and commentary on her writing by Le Guin. The protagonist of the novel, the envoy Genly Ai, is on a planet called Winter ("Gethen" [...] {{in the language of}} its own people) to convince the citizens to join the Ekumen. Winter is, as its name indicates, a planet <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> cold.|$|E
500|$|Sustainability is {{studied and}} managed over many scales (levels or frames of reference) {{of time and}} space and in many {{contexts}} of environmental, social and economic organization.

In short, it can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it.
