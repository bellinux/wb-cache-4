5|$|There {{has been}} debate over <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> the air {{campaign}} against Japan since World WarII. During the war the American public approved of the bombing of Germany and Japan, and {{the few people who}} criticized the raids were seen as unrealistic or even traitors. Some United States government and military personnel believed that the bombing campaign was morally ambiguous, however, but rarely voiced their views publicly.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{struggle}} {{began in}} India when the Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence. Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the Ghadar Conspiracy ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts. This led to tension, {{particularly in the}} Punjab region, where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre. In Britain public opinion was divided over <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> the massacre, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion. The subsequent Non-Co-Operation movement was called off in March 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident, and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years.|$|E
5|$|A typical Robinsonade– a {{genre of}} fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe– {{and one of}} the most popular of its type, the book first went on sale in late 1857 and has never been out of print. Among the novel's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century British imperialism in the South Pacific, and the importance of hierarchy and leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel Lord of the Flies (1954), which inverted <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in Lord of the Flies evil is within them.|$|E

Delta subsequently meet CIA agent Jeff Riggs, who is leading a raid on the city's last water supply.

5|$|Martin's inspirations {{included}} the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon. A Song of Ice and Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal {{of women and}} religion, {{as well as its}} realism. An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader, and the success or survival of point of view characters is never assured. Within the often morally ambiguous world of A Song of Ice and Fire, questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> violence frequently arise.|$|E

5|$|The Allied bombing {{campaign}} {{was one of}} the main factors which influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender in mid-August 1945. However, there has been a long-running debate over <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> the attacks on Japanese cities, and the use of atomic weapons is particularly controversial. The most commonly cited estimate of Japanese casualties from the raids is 333,000 killed and 473,000 wounded. There are a number of other estimates of total fatalities, however, which range from 241,000 to 900,000. In addition to the loss of mostly civilian life, the raids contributed to a large decline in industrial production.|$|E
5|$|The Amazing Jeckel Brothers is {{the fifth}} studio album by American hip hop group Insane Clown Posse, {{released}} on May 25, 1999, by Island Records, in association with Psychopathic Records. Recording sessions for the album took place from 1998 to 1999. The album {{is the fifth}} Joker's Card in the group's Dark Carnival mythology. The album's lyrics focus on the 9 circles of hell, and <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> man as he is torn between righteousness and evil. The album's titular Jeckel Brothers are spirits who juggle balls of fire, representing the sins committed during the mortal life of the dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventional}} {{level of}} moral reasoning {{is typical of}} adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E

5|$|The one {{exception}} to the general rule of concealment and obfuscation was that of border guards who died on duty. Most were killed either deliberately or accidentally by escapees or escape helpers. The dead guards were hailed by East German government propaganda as heroes, but West German public opinion was divided about <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> killing border guards. Some took the view that escapees were entitled to use force {{in the course of}} crossing the border, but (as in one case tried in a West Berlin court) others saw the guard's life as taking priority over an escapee's freedom.|$|E
5|$|The pre-conventional {{level of}} moral {{reasoning}} is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit {{this level of}} reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists {{of the first and}} second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.|$|E

5|$|French-speaking naturalists {{in several}} {{countries}} showed appreciation of the much modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> Darwin's views.|$|E
5|$|During the 1880s, Moore {{began work}} {{on a series of}} novels in a realist style. His first novel, A Modern Lover (1883) was a three-volume work, as {{preferred}} by the circulating libraries, and deals with the art scene of the 1870s and 1880s in which many characters are identifiably real. The circulating libraries in England banned the book because of its explicit portrayal of the amorous pursuits of its hero. At this time the British circulating libraries, such as Mudie's Select Library, controlled the market for fiction and the public, who paid fees to borrow their books, expected them to guarantee <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> the novels available. His next book, a novel in the realist style, A Mummers Wife (1885) was also regarded as unsuitable by Mudie's and W H Smith refused to stock it on their news-stalls. Despite this, during its first year of publication the book was in its fourteenth edition mainly due to the publicity stirred up by its opponents. The French newspaper Le Voltaire published it in serial form as La Femme du cabotin in July–October 1886. His next novel A Drama in Muslin was banned by Mudie's and Smith's. In response Moore declared war on the circulating libraries by publishing two provocative pamphlets; Literature at Nurse and Circulating Morals. In these, he complained that the libraries profit from salacious popular fiction while refusing to stock serious literary fiction.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, {{the first}} Polish talkies premiered, using sound-on-disc systems: Moralność pani Dulskiej (<b>The</b> <b>Morality</b> <b>of</b> Mrs. Dulska) in March and the all-talking Niebezpieczny romans (Dangerous Love Affair) in October. In Italy, whose once vibrant film {{industry}} had become moribund {{by the late}} 1920s, the first talkie, La Canzone dell'amore (The Song of Love), also came out in October; within two years, Italian cinema would be enjoying a revival. The first movie spoken in Czech debuted in 1930 as well, Tonka Šibenice (Tonka of the Gallows). Several European nations with minor positions in the field also produced their first talking pictures—Belgium (in French), Denmark, Greece, and Romania. The Soviet Union's robust film industry came out with its first sound features in December 1930: Dziga Vertov's nonfiction Entuziazm had an experimental, dialogueless soundtrack; Abram Room's documentary Plan velikikh rabot (The Plan of the Great Works) had music and spoken voiceovers. Both were made with locally developed sound-on-film systems, two of the two hundred or so movie sound systems then available somewhere in the world. In June 1931, the Nikolai Ekk drama Putevka v zhizn (The Road to Life or A Start in Life), premiered as the Soviet Union's first true talking picture.|$|E

40|$|This study explores {{how human}} beings became moral beings. Are we the only creatures that {{engage in this}} way of thinking, doing and discerning? The {{ultimate}} focus {{of this study is}} to present an integrated perspective on <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>morality,</b> taking its lead from evolutionary biology. It further stresses the notion that a firmer grip on <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> can provide us with a clearer understanding of what it means to be human. In the discussion of important ethical issues, it is of utmost importance to have a clear understanding of embodied existence. The study commences by gaining a more comprehensive understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>morality,</b> which is achieved by exploring the modern discourse on the origin thereof. It consists of an exposition of three perspectives on <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> – theological, philosophical and evolutionary biological – in which the contribution of influential representatives of each perspective are in focus. The study continues with a more in-depth study of the evolutionary biological perspective on <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>morality.</b> This is accomplished through an in-depth study of primatologist Frans de Waal’s perspective on <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>morality.</b> De Waal posits that morality is built into our species. Rather than coming to us top-down from God, or any other external source, morality for De Waal arises bottom-up from our emotions and our day-to-day social interactions, which themselves evolved from foundations in animal societies. De Waal’s opinion on <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> is assessed by means of a discussion of contemporary responses on his particular view. This research is undertaken from the basic conviction that an exclusive theological perspective on <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> does not represent a comprehensive genesis <b>of</b> <b>morality.</b> Theology engaging with the evolutionary biology will, therefore, result in a more comprehensive understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>morality.</b> Dissertation (MTh) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has seen a}} vibrant debate about <b>the</b> <b>moralities</b> <b>of</b> trade and <b>the</b> {{possibility}} of reconnecting consumers and producers {{in an age of}} globalisation. Fair trade, in particular, has attracted attention as the source of a new international moral economy. In this paper, I seek to widen the frame of discussion, bringing history, geography, and ethics into closer conversation. Looking beyond a conventional progressive narrative, I retrieve <b>the</b> ambivalent <b>moralities</b> <b>of</b> trade and consumption in the modern period. I highlight the role of empire shopping movements as well as of popular free trade and international distributive justice, putting imperialist consumers as well as liberals back into the picture. I offer a critique of a sequential view of traditional `moral economy' being replaced by a modern demoralised `political economy', which underlies current notions of `remoralising' trade. Modern commerce has generated and been shaped by diverse <b>moralities</b> <b>of</b> consumption. Greater attention to the diverse social and ideological lineages of phenomena like fair trade will be useful to scholars reflecting on caring at a distance today...|$|R
