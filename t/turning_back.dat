5|$|Extensive European {{exploration}} {{near the}} confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers began nearly a century before the city was officially founded. Explorer Louis Joliet and Jesuit priest Jacques Marquette traveled south on the Mississippi River in June 1673, passed the future site of St. Louis and reached the mouth of the Arkansas River before <b>turning</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 7:40pm, the 727 {{took off}} with only Cooper, pilot Scott, flight attendant Mucklow, copilot Rataczak, and flight engineer H. E. Anderson aboard. Two F-106 fighter aircraft scrambled from nearby McChord Air Force Base followed behind the airliner, one above it and one below, out of Cooper's view. A Lockheed T-33 trainer, diverted from an unrelated Air National Guard mission, also shadowed the 727 before running low on fuel and <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> near the Oregon–California state line.|$|E
5|$|H-58 meets M-77 in Grand Marais. This town is the {{location}} of a small harbor that was once the home of a lumber shipping port. H-58 turns south to run concurrently along M-77 for about two blocks before <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> eastward. The county road runs along the southern edge of the harbor past the township's school and out of town. The pavement ends when the road leaves Alger County for Luce County.|$|E
5000|$|The album version {{contains}} an opening with a backwards message. When {{the song is}} played in reverse, the message, in a masked heavy voice (performed by ELO drummer, Bev Bevan), can be heard stating, [...] "The music is reversible but time is not. <b>Turn</b> <b>back.</b> <b>Turn</b> <b>back.</b> <b>Turn</b> <b>back.</b> <b>Turn</b> back." [...] — ostensibly Jeff Lynne's shot at backmasking hysteria, after satanic allegations were made against their song [...] "Eldorado" [...] by Fundamentalist Christianity members. Snippets of Messiah by Handel can be heard during the album opening as well.|$|R

5|$|SH-132 turns {{east and}} {{overlaps}} the U.S. routes for one mile (1.6km), before splitting back {{off to the}} north. In Carrier, it briefly overlaps State Highway 45. North of Carrier, the highway crosses another railroad track, this one operated by Burlington Northern Santa Fe, before running {{to the west of}} Hillsdale. At the Garfield–Grant County line, the highway curves to the northwest before <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> to a due north heading in order to line up with Grant County's road grid.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{data from}} the JTWC {{suggests}} that Gerimena weakened as it turned southeast. Then, it turned east-southeast. On February 24, Gerimena briefly level off in intensity while <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> to south. Furthermore, the JTWC stopped {{keeping an eye on}} Gerimena at 0000 UTC on February 26 as the storm re-curved east. However, MFR continued to track Gerimena until March 4 as it fluctuated in intensity.|$|E
5|$|Solomon Taylor {{ordered the}} group of locals not to fire. It is unclear which group fired first, but three shots were heard, one of which hit Lieutenant Robinson. When the deserters fled the scene the Lincoln Midnight Riders chased them {{approximately}} a quarter mile before <b>turning</b> <b>back.</b> The shooting was mentioned in the Columbia Democrat which also wished Robinson a full recovery. Robinson died from peritonitis on November 3, 1864.|$|E
50|$|In 1980, {{the road}} was <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> south of Highway 100. It was rolled back further in 1984, with the Brooklyn Boulevard section {{becoming}} CSAH 152. The remainder was <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> in the 1988 highway swap with Hennepin County, becoming CSAH 81.|$|R
5000|$|... "Fire on High" [...] {{contains}} a backwards {{message in the}} beginning. When the song is played backwards, drummer Bev Bevan can be heard saying [...] "The music is reversible, but time is not. <b>Turn</b> <b>back,</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back,</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back,</b> <b>turn</b> back...". This was, ostensibly, Jeff Lynne's response to accusations that the song [...] "Eldorado" [...] contained Satanic messages that could be heard when played backwards. [...] "Down Home Town" [...] begins with the chorus of [...] "Waterfall" [...] played backwards. A portion of the string crescendo from [...] "Nightrider" [...] was used backwards on [...] "Evil Woman".|$|R
5000|$|... "Heart of Stone" [...] and [...] "If I Could <b>Turn</b> <b>Back</b> Time" [...] {{were both}} {{slightly}} remixed for the single. The [...] "Heart of Stone" [...] remix {{is available on}} CD on the compilation If I Could <b>Turn</b> <b>Back</b> Time: Cher's Greatest Hits issued by Geffen Records.|$|R
5|$|The July 1, 1919, {{incarnation}} of M-89 was much shorter relative to today's road. Its western terminus {{was at a}} junction with M-11 (later US31, now A-2) near Ganges. It traveled east to Fennville then turned south to Pearl before <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> to the east towards Allegan on an alignment that is a few {{miles south of the}} present day configuration. The highway then left Allegan on present day M-222 and terminated at M-13, which is now A-45 east of the US131 freeway.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the brigade's glider units, forty Waco gliders {{carrying}} the 64th Airlanding Light Battery Royal Artillery and their 75mm pack howitzers, landed at 09:20. The thirty-five larger Horsa gliders, transporting the 300th Airlanding Anti-Tank Battery and its equipment, failed to arrive, <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> to Italy due to an overcast sky at the landing zone. The Horsas returned with the afternoon's second wave landing at 15:04.|$|E
5|$|Washington State Route 221 (SR221) {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with SR14 in the unincorporated community of Paterson. After leaving Paterson the highway travels north through rural farm land as a two-lane highway. A few minor roads are intersected before the roadway {{turns to the}} west after about , before <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> to the north. After the highway resumes its northerly course it climbs into the Horse Heaven Hills, gaining a passing lane through the uphill segments, before finally terminating at SR22 in south Prosser.|$|E

5|$|When {{they reach}} the {{coordinates}} shown on the parchments, there is no island in sight. Frustrated, Haddock ponders <b>turning</b> <b>back,</b> but Tintin soon realizes the problem: If Sir Francis had used a French chart instead of an English chart to calculate the position, the coordinates would have been measured on the Paris Meridian rather than the Greenwich Meridian. As they have been using the Greenwich Meridian, they realise that they are too far west.|$|E
5|$|Augustine was {{the prior}} of a monastery in Rome when Pope Gregory the Great chose him in 595 {{to lead a}} mission, usually known as the Gregorian mission, to Britain to Christianize King Æthelberht and his Kingdom of Kent from Anglo-Saxon paganism. Kent was {{probably}} chosen because Æthelberht had married a Christian princess, Bertha, daughter of Charibert I the King of Paris, who was expected to exert some influence over her husband. Before reaching Kent, the missionaries had considered <b>turning</b> <b>back,</b> but Gregory urged them on, and in 597, Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet and proceeded to Æthelberht's main town of Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Bligh reached England in April 1790, whereupon the Admiralty {{despatched}} HMS Pandora {{to apprehend}} the mutineers. Fourteen were captured in Tahiti and imprisoned on board Pandora, which then searched without success for Christian's party that had hidden on Pitcairn Island. After <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> toward England, Pandora ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, {{with the loss of}} 31 crew and 4 prisoners from Bounty. The 10 surviving detainees reached England in June 1792 and were court martialled; 4 were acquitted, 3 were pardoned, and 3 were hanged.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day of the strike, which has spread to Buffland's rival city of Clearfield , the mood among the laborers has turned ugly. Temple warns that the attacks on Algonquin Avenue are imminent, and aids Farnham's force in <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> assaults on the captain's house and on the Belding residence. Bott and Sleeny are {{captured}} by the force; the former is sent to prison but Farnham has pity on Sleeny as a good workman, and the carpenter serves only a few days. The settlement of the strike in Clearfield takes the wind out of the Buffland action, and soon most are back at work, though some agitators are dismissed.|$|E
5|$|During the day, {{the storm}} crossed 180°, {{entering}} the western Pacific basin and being re-designated as a typhoon. The storm tracked steadily northwestward, attaining a peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), a high-end Category 3 storm, before <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> towards the east. The storm gradually weakened, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September17 and again crossing the International Date Line. The system dissipated shortly thereafter over open waters. Throughout its existence, Hurricane/Typhoon Della traveled roughly , the longest known track of any Pacific hurricane at the time.|$|E
5|$|Early on November 20, the JTWC {{reported}} that a tropical depression had developed. Shortly thereafter, MFR {{reported that}} a tropical disturbance had formed. The low moved west-southwest while gradually deepening. Late on November 20, MFR upgraded the system into a moderate tropical storm. The storm failed to intensify further as it had moved onshore northern Madagascar. By November 21, MFR estimated that the storm weakened back into a disturbance. After emerging into the Mozambique Channel, Anety reportedly re-intensified back to moderate tropical storm status. While making its closest approach to the African mainland, the storm resumed weakening while <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> southeast. On November 23, both agencies stopped monitoring the system.|$|E

50|$|April 1, 1997 saw a huge {{change in}} Ontario's provincial highway network: over 4000 km of {{highways}} were <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> to county, city, and local authorities. Highway 40 was largely spared, although south of Highway 401, {{the road was}} <b>turned</b> <b>back,</b> shortening the road by the 17 km it gained in the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|According to Skylitzes, {{the death}} of Botaneiates {{alongside}} most of his men greatly disheartened Basil, so that the emperor, despite his victory at Kleidion, halted his campaign and <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> to his base, Mosynopolis. It was only after reaching Mosynopolis and learning of Samuel's death that he <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> and continued his campaign.|$|R
5|$|In the {{resulting}} battle, both sides lost numerous warships in two extremely destructive surface engagements at night. Nevertheless, the U.S. succeeded in <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> {{attempts by the}} Japanese to bombard Henderson Field with battleships. Allied aircraft also sank most of the Japanese troop transports and prevented {{the majority of the}} Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal. Thus, the battle turned back Japan's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby Tulagi, resulting in a strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies and deciding the ultimate outcome of the Guadalcanal campaign in their favor.|$|E
5|$|Maximilian held out, making {{another attempt}} to invade Lombardy; his army failed to reach Milan before <b>turning</b> <b>back,</b> and by December 1516, he had entered into {{negotiations}} with Francis. The resulting Treaty of Brussels not only accepted French occupation of Milan, but also confirmed Venetian claims to {{the remainder of the}} Imperial possessions in Lombardy (except for Cremona), effectively ending the war with a return to the status quo of 1508. The peace, however, would last only four years; the election of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 caused Francis, who had desired the position for himself, to begin the Italian War of 1521–26. The Italian Wars, thus reignited, would then continue until 1530 without significant interruption.|$|E
5|$|Resistance {{against the}} Spanish continued, and hostile Ch'ol killed several newly baptised Christian Indians. In early March 1696 {{such was the}} success of the friars that captain Jacobo de Alzayaga and the Mercederians decided to try to reach Lake Petén Itzá. They headed eastwards towards the Pasión River with 150 heavily armed {{soldiers}} plus native guides, travelling in five large canoes. They got as far as the savannah to the southeast of the lake before <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> for unknown reasons. Antonio Margil remained in Dolores del Lakandon until 1697. The Ch'ol of the Lacandon Jungle were resettled in Huehuetenango in the early 18th century.|$|E
