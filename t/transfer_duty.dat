40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is mainly}} {{a study of}} the nature of trusts and their daily operational limitations, which are frequently misunderstood and/or misused. My research question was whether a trust could be sold, and if so, what the tax implications of such a ‘sale’ would be. The overall approach was to perform a literature review and a critical analysis of current information available on South African trust law and the <b>Transfer</b> <b>Duty</b> Act 40 of 1949. Many studies have been undertaken in the past on various aspects of my subject, but the subject has never been studied as a cohesive whole. These studies formed the basis of the literature review. To arrive at an answer, an analysis of the available literature and South African judgments was undertaken. My concluding chapter gives an indication of whether a trust can be ‘sold’, what the current <b>transfer</b> <b>duty</b> implications are and what it is submitted they should be.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2005. Chapter 1 Introduction In {{his budget}} speech of 23 February 2000 the {{minister}} of finance Mr Trevor Manuel announced the introduction of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) in South Africa. Internationally, the idea of such tax is uncommon, with many ofour trading partners having implemented CGT decades ago. In order to give effect on the proposal relating to CGT, an Eighth Schedule {{has been added to}} the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962. The Eighth Schedule determines a taxable gain or loss and a new section 26 A of the principal Act provides that the taxable gain is included in taxable income. The date from which capital gains tax started was 1 October 2001. Chapter 2 The transfer ofprimary residence from private individuals The Department of Inland Revenue makes a distinction between what it calls Property Investors and Property Traders. This is a very important distinction; A Property Investor will be liable to pay Income Tax, on rental income and Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on profits made when selling the property in the normal way, however, a Property Dealer (also known as a trader) will find that all his or her profits made on the sale of a property are taxed as Income Tax and not taxed as Capital Gains. So, the key to deciding your tax minimising strategy is figure out whether you will be treated as a dealer or an investor. The Eighth Schedule to th~ Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 provides that only natural persons (individuals) are entitled to exclude the first R 1 million of gains on disposal of their primary residences. Chapter 3 & 4 The transfer of primary residence from Trusts, Companies and Close Corporations Many individuals have historically purchased their residence in companies for a variety of reasons, including protection from creditors, avoidance of <b>transfer</b> <b>duty</b> and estate duty and circumvention of the repealed Group Areas Act. These persons now face a potential Capital Gains Tax (CGT) liability when their company, close corporation or trust disposes of the residence. ~ The Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act 2004 provides that only natural persons (individuals) and special trusts are entitled to exclude the first R 1 million of gains on disposal of their primary residence. This exclusion does not apply where a company, close corporation or trust owns the residence.

In general, these techniques {{can be divided into}} two groups: active and passive techniques. The active techniques require external forces, e. g. electric field, acoustic or surface vibration etc. The passive techniques require fluid additives or special surface geometries. Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) techniques have been introduced as one of the types of active heat transfer enhancement techniques. This paper presents a review of research works on electrohydrodynamic heat transfer enhancement.

It is shown that for heat exchanger with constant wall temperature (i. e., condensers and evaporators), there does exist a particular number of transfer units which minimizes the dimensionless rate of entropy generation. An algebraic expression for the optimum heat exchanger effectiveness, based on the working conditions, heat exchanger geometry and fluid properties, is also presented. The theoretical analysis led to the conclusion that a high effectiveness heat exchanger does not necessarily provide the best thermal-hydraulic design...|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish between types of commercial and residential property for value-added tax (VAT) purposes. The {{reason for this is}} because the supply of residential property may be exempt from VAT in certain cases, whereas the supply of commercial property is a taxable supply. One of the aims of this treatise was to generate some characteristics that can assist vendors to distinguish between types of commercial and residential property for VAT purposes. SARS proposed numerous changes to the VAT Act with regards to fixed property in 2011. This treatise explains the reason for the changes made and also comments on them. Firstly, property developers previously had to account for an output tax adjustment when they changed the use of their property i. e. from a taxable use (selling the completed units) to a non-taxable use (renting the completed units as a residential dwelling). This „output tax adjustment‟ sometimes places developers in a financial dilemma, especially in times of an economic depression. SARS therefore provided „developers‟ as defined with a short term solution. This short term solution provides property developers with a 36 month temporarily relief period, before they have to account for the „output tax adjustment‟. Therefore, the new section 18 B was proposed to assist property developers in times of an economic recession. Secondly, in the past a vendor who acquired a property from a non-vendor to make taxable supplies was allowed a notional input tax deduction, limited to the <b>transfer</b> <b>duty</b> paid. SARS has however "delinked VAT from transfer duty‟, which means that the notional input tax deduction will no longer be limited to the <b>transfer</b> <b>duty</b> paid. This change may benefit vendors as they may now be allowed a bigger input tax deduction. Furthermore, the treatise also compares the VAT treatment of the above issues to that of the goods and services tax treatment in New Zealand. The treatise concludes with a summary of all distinguishing characteristics identified and other findings noted...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} in energy cost and energy consumption has required more {{effective use of}} energy. The problem of dissipating high heat fluxes has received much attention due to its importance in applications such as heat exchanger. The heat <b>transfer</b> <b>duty</b> of heat exchangers can be improved by heat transfer enhancement techniques. In recent years, Considerable efforts {{have been made to}} increase heat transfer rates in heat exchangers by implementing passive enhancement methods that require no direct consumption of external power. On the basis of a theoretical and experimental analysis the conclusion derived was that the best heat transfer enhancement can be reached by the use of porous material as an inexpensive technique to extend the heat transfer area, improve effective thermal conductivity, and mix fluid flow. This paper presents a brief discussion on the application of using porous media to heat exchangers by means of heat transfer enhancement...|$|E

40|$|A {{model for}} {{predicting}} heat and mass transfer and pressure drops occurring inside a tube-in-tube refrigerant cooled absorber (RCA) is developed. This heat exchanger {{is used as}} a low pressure absorber in a half-effect water-ammonia absorption chiller. The two-phase stream, resulting from the mixing at low pressure of the weak solution coming from the generator and the refrigerant leaving the evaporator, flows in the tube-in-tube annulus, while the stream of condensed refrigerant, throttled to a pressure level intermediate between condenser and evaporator pressures, flows counter-current in the internal tube. The RCA model is validated by comparing overall heat <b>transfer</b> <b>duty,</b> pressure drops on each stream and temperature axial profile in the annulus with experimental data. Results are in reasonable agreement with experiments in most of the analyzed cases, although some deviations exist in off-design operations.
