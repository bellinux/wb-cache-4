40|$|Purpose: <b>The</b> <b>accountant</b> {{has been}} characterised {{in popular culture}} as dull and boring. Accounting {{scholarship}} consistently describes this stereotype as negative. The purpose {{of this research is}} to enhance our understanding of this stereotype by comparing the characterisation of <b>the</b> <b>accountant</b> found in contemporary jokes with a similar characterisation found in commedia dell'arte, which is a form of improvisational theatre. Design/methodology/approach: This research employs netnography to identify the stereotype of <b>the</b> <b>accountant</b> portrayed in jokes on social networking sites. To enrich our understanding of the stereotype of the characterisation of <b>the</b> <b>accountant</b> in contemporary jokes, it is compared with the characterisation of il dottore, the stock character of the professional man in commedia dell'arte. Findings: The characterisation of <b>the</b> <b>accountant</b> in contemporary jokes is consistent with characterisations of <b>the</b> <b>accountant</b> in other areas of popular culture, confirming that the stereotype is widely entrenched in popular culture. Contemporary jokes provide a more detailed characterisation than previously identified in accounting scholarship. Since the stereotype of il dottore in commedia dell'arte resembles the stereotype of <b>the</b> <b>accountant</b> as portrayed in contemporary jokes, studying commedia dell'arte provides an approach that enhances our understanding of the characterisation of <b>the</b> <b>accountant</b> in popular culture. Originality/value: The contribution of this research to accounting scholarship is the deployment of commedia dell'arte to capture the essence of the stereotype of <b>the</b> <b>accountant</b> as portrayed in popular culture. Extending the definition of popular culture to include contemporary jokes brings a unique use of netnography to accounting scholarship...|$|R

5|$|The Singapore case Chew Kia Ngee v. Singapore Society of Accountants (1988), {{though not}} a {{judicial}} review application, illustrates how a decision-maker acts incorrectly if it fails {{to take into account}} relevant considerations. The Disciplinary Committee of the Singapore Society of Accountants had found the appellant, an auditor, guilty of an act or default discreditable to an accountant within the meaning of section 33(1)(b) of <b>the</b> <b>Accountants</b> Act because an incomplete auditor's report form that he had signed in advance had accidentally been submitted to the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The Committee had ordered that he be suspended from practice for five years. The appellant appealed the decision to the High Court on the basis that the Committee had not taken into account all the relevant considerations of the case in arriving at its decision. The Court concurred, holding that the Committee had not properly considered that the appellant had reviewed the incomplete form with his audit manager and had instructed him how to fill in the rest of it. Therefore, this was not a case of an accountant recklessly signing a blank form without regard to his duties as an auditor. Accordingly, the Court allowed the appeal and set aside the Committee's order.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{commonwealth}} countries, the word chartered does {{not refer to}} a royal charter, since India is a republic. At the time of passing the Chartered Accountants Act, various titles used for similar professionals in other countries were considered, such as Certified Public Accountant. However, many accountants had already acquired membership of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and other Chartered Societies of Great Britain and were practising as Chartered Accountants. This had created some sort of brand value. This designation inherited a public impression that Chartered Accountants had better qualifications than Registered Accountants. Hence <b>the</b> <b>accountants</b> were very stern in their stand that, the Indian accountancy professionals should be designated only as Chartered Accountants. After much debate in the Indian Constituent Assembly, the controversial term, chartered was accepted. When the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 came into force on 1 July 1949, the term Chartered Accountant superseded the title of Registered Accountant. This day is celebrated as Chartered Accountants day every year.|$|E

These companies that are started before 2010 faced a choice to either keep <b>the</b> <b>accountant</b> or not {{and that is why}} {{the purpose of this study}} is to contribute with a deeper understanding of why small businesses choses to hire an accountant or not, and if this choice differs between livelihood- and growth companies. This is achieved by explaining how small businesses acted and reasoned after the deregulation of the mandatory auditing. This study has a qualitative method where twelve personal interviews were conducted in order to acquire the empiricism. The result of this study shows that the factors behind the choice to keep <b>the</b> <b>accountant</b> or not, differs between livelihood- and growth companies. The factors that matters to growth companies who keeps <b>the</b> <b>accountant</b> is time, quality <b>the</b> <b>accountant</b> profession. To <b>the</b> growth companies that don’t keep <b>the</b> <b>accountant</b> <b>the</b> factors are the cost, saving for growth and the accounting consultant.

Conclusions to be drawn from the results of the study, is that small businesses in both emerging and subsistence businesses mainly affected by <b>the</b> auditor, or <b>accountant</b> in their choice. Those small business owners who choose to retain the auditor do this even though they have the knowledge, but not the time to do all the economic work, while they values the auditor's knowledge and thus experience a higher quality of the accounts.

2500|$|The {{establishment}} of a duty of care is usually broken up into a three-step test. The first case to establish a general duty of care was Donoghue v Stevenson. Famously, Mrs Donoghue claimed compensation for illness, after she consumed a ginger beer containing a decomposed snail, in a public house in Paisley, Scotland. The bottle was opaque so Mrs Donoghue, nor the shopkeeper, could see a snail, {{and at the time}} she could not sue the shopkeeper for breach of contract or consumer rights. The House of Lords, by a majority held that the manufacturer, Mr Stevenson, was liable in tort. Lord Atkin held liability was [...] "based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay" [...] and people [...] "must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour." [...] By contrast, Lord Macmillan suggested that the law should protect Mrs Donoghue by incremental analogy to previous cases. Nevertheless, Lord Atkin's speech was widely followed, and understood to contain three main points for establishing a duty of care. Firstly, the concept of reasonable foreseeability of harm; secondly, the claimant and the defendant being in a relationship of proximity; and thirdly, and more loosely, it being fair, just and reasonable to impose liability on the defendant for his careless actions. This three step scheme (also known as the tripartite or threefold test) [...] however, did not crystallise until the case of Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman. A company called Caparo took over another company, by buying up a majority of its shares. It did this because it sneakily obtained word from a company audit that the target was financially sound. The audit was prepared by a group of accountants (Dickman) and was intended for shareholders, not outsiders. Once Caparo owned the company it found that the finances were in fact pretty shoddy, and so it sued <b>the</b> <b>accountants</b> for being negligent in its audit preparation. The House of Lords found against Caparo, and established the current threefold test. Although it was [...] "reasonably foreseeable" [...] that outsiders might learn of the carelessly prepared information, it was not the case that Caparo and Dickman were in a relationship of [...] "proximity". This the court used as a term of art (note, this is different from the American use of the word), to say that it should not be the case that absolutely anyone hearing something said that was stupid and acted on it can sue. The court was reacting to its concern that to allow a claim here might open the floodgates of litigation. The third element, whether liability would be [...] "fair, just and reasonable" [...] was an extra hurdle added, as a catch all discretionary measure for the judiciary to block further claims.|$|E
