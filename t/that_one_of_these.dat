5|$|Several {{of these}} {{installations}} were identified from Royal Air Force (RAF) aerial reconnaissance photographs during 1941, but their exact purpose {{and the nature}} of the equipment that they possessed was not known. Some British scientists believed that these stations were connected with the heavy losses being experienced by RAF bombers conducting bombing raids against targets in Occupied Europe. The scientists requested <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> installations be raided and the technology it possessed be studied and, if possible, extracted and brought back to Britain for further examination.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, 76T {{was part of the}} 1st Torpedo Group of the 3rd Torpedo Craft Division of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Torpedo Craft Flotilla. During the war, 76T was used for convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, anti-submarine operations, and shore bombardment missions. She also conducted patrols and supported seaplane raids against the Italian coast. On 24 May 1915, 76T and seven other 250t-class boats were involved in the shelling of various Italian shore-based targets known as the Bombardment of Ancona, with 76T involved in the operation against Ancona itself. In late November 1915, the Austro-Hungarian fleet deployed a force from its main fleet base at Pola to Cattaro in the southern Adriatic; this force included six of the eight T-group torpedo boats, so it is possible <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> was 76T. This force was tasked to maintain a permanent patrol of the Albanian coastline and interdict any troop transports crossing from Italy.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{departure}} of No.1 FTS in 1947, no flying was conducted at Uranquinty until 1951, when the newly formed No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS) inherited the base facilities. No.1 BFTS transferred to Point Cook in 1958, at which point Uranquinty was closed. The RAAF units that operated at the base formed a close connection with the local community. In 1999, a memorial to No.5 SFTS was erected at Wirraway Park, Uranquinty. An additional panel to the memorial was unveiled in September 2002 by the Governor-General of Australia, Peter Hollingworth; the proceedings included an aerial display by a Pilatus PC-9 of the Roulettes aerobatic team, {{and the arrival of}} a Wirraway from Temora Aviation Museum, the first time in 45 years <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> trainers had landed at Uranquinty.|$|E
