40|$|Background: <b>The</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> fatigue {{has been}} {{described}} {{in a variety of}} ways but absence of a single taxonomy may be hindering research into this prevalent symptom.

5|$|If {{the disease}} is {{associated}} with cancer, direct treatment of the cancer often relieves <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> LEMS. Other treatments often used are steroids, azathioprine, which suppress the immune system, intravenous immunoglobulin, which outcompetes autoreactive antibody for Fc receptors, and pyridostigmine and 3,4-diaminopyridine, which enhance the neuromuscular transmission.

40|$|The {{experience}} of fatigue {{has been a}} common problem among community populations for decades. <b>The</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> fatigue is also a frequent health complaint in primary care practices. Fatigue patients {{have been shown to}} be significantly high users of health care resources, particularly when compared to non-fatigued patient populations. To date, an understanding of the presence and <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> fatigue within <b>the</b> context of the Canadian health care system has been understudied. The objective of this research was to determine the number of patients who were suffering from <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> fatigue within a primary care setting and to explore the determinants of their health care utilization patterns. Furthermore, these patterns of health care use were compared to a non-fatigue symptom patient population, who were also from a primary care setting. The data were extracted from a longitudinal electronic medical record database, which captures details of primary care encounters throughout Southwestern Ontario. <b>The</b> fatigue <b>symptom</b> patients were found to experience a large complex of co-occurring morbidity and a markedly high level of referral following their visit with <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> fatigue. As well, <b>the</b> fatigue <b>symptom</b> patients were found to have an increased number of subsequent visits to their primary care provider and an increased number of investigations during a one year follow-up period, when compared to <b>the</b> non-fatigue <b>symptom</b> group. These findings begin to create an understanding <b>of</b> fatigue <b>symptom</b> patients, their complex of morbidity, and their subsequent health care use patterns. This information will help to improve <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> fatigue <b>symptom</b> patients in Canadian primary care practices and in the Canadian health care system more broadly...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Generalized anxiety {{disorder}} (GAD) is a commonly occurring {{anxiety disorder}} {{that many times}} is characterized by an onset in adolescence and symptoms that increase in severity Into adulthood Due to the persistent nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disorder's primary <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> worry, which appears more related to a personality trait than an anxiety state, the current DSM-IV nosology of GAD has been debated. Recently, evidence is accumulating that suggests that <b>the</b> GAD <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> worry is strongly related to the personality trait of neuroticism. This study investigates whether <b>the</b> GAD <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> worry and neuroticism are best explained as 1 general factor or as 2 distinct entities in adolescents.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> {{the common}} cold are {{believed}} to be primarily related to the immune response to the virus. The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to human ICAM-1 receptors through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract. RSV does cause epithelium damage. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. In young children when it affects the trachea it may produce <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> croup due to the small size of their airways.|$|E

5|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract. When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody.

5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. <b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is poisonous. A case of {{poisoning}} {{was reported}} from Finland, where three individuals {{believed they had}} consumed the edible parasol mushroom Macrolepiota procera. <b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> poisoning, which began 1–2hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, were gastrointestinal—nausea and heavy vomiting. Two had central nervous system manifestations and cholinergic symptoms, including hallucinations, confusion, or loss of consciousness as well as profuse salivation and sweating. All three individuals recovered within 4–24hours without any damage to liver, kidneys or the central nervous system. As this incident demonstrates, cooking the mushrooms does not completely neutralize the toxic components of Amanita regalis. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains ibotenic acid and muscimol, the same toxic constituents as Amanita muscaria.|$|E
