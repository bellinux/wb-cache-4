25|$|The comptometer, {{introduced}} in 1887, {{was the first}} machine to use a keyboard which consisted of columns of nine keys (from 1 to 9) for each digit. The Dalton adding machine, manufactured from 1902, {{was the first to}} have a 10 key keyboard. Electric motors were used on some mechanical calculators from 1901. In 1961, a comptometer type machine, the Anita mk7 from Sumlock comptometer Ltd., became the first desktop mechanical calculator to receive an all electronic calculator engine, creating the link in between these two industries and marking the beginning of its decline. The production of mechanical calculators came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the 1970s closing an industry that had lasted for 120 years.|$|E
25|$|A {{commutator}} is {{a mechanism}} used to switch {{the input of}} most DC machines and certain AC machines consisting of slip ring segments insulated {{from each other and}} from the electric motor's shaft. The motor's armature current is supplied through the stationary brushes in contact with the revolving commutator, which causes required current reversal and applies power to the machine in an optimal manner as the rotor rotates from pole to pole. In absence of such current reversal, the motor would brake <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop.</b> <b>In</b> light of significant advances {{in the past few decades}} due to improved technologies in electronic controller, sensorless control, induction motor, and permanent magnet motor fields, electromechanically commutated motors are increasingly being displaced by externally commutated induction and permanent-magnet motors.|$|E
25|$|Although Roosevelt Island {{is located}} {{directly}} under the Queensboro Bridge, it is not directly accessible from the bridge itself. A trolley used to connect passengers from Queens and Manhattan <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of the}} bridge, where passengers took an elevator down to the island. The trolley operated from the bridge's opening in 1909 until April 7, 1957. Between 1930 and 1955, the only vehicular access to the island was provided by an elevator system in the Elevator Storehouse that transported cars and commuters between the bridge and the island. The elevator was closed to the public after the construction of the Roosevelt Island Bridge between the island and Astoria in Queens in 1955; the elevator was demolished in 1970, but a similar elevator ran from the Queensboro Bridge to the island as late as 1973.|$|E

25|$|On lap 173, Earnhardt {{drove his}} {{familiar}} black No. 3 car in third place, {{with two of}} his team's cars, the blue No. 15 Chevrolet driven by Michael Waltrip and the red No. 8 Chevrolet driven by his son Dale Earnhardt, Jr., running first and second in front of him. On that lap, a huge crash on the back straightaway eliminated 18 cars in a spectacular fashion. Those involved in the crash were Jason Leffler, Steve Park (another of Earnhardt's drivers), both Rusty (who would rally back to finish third) and Kenny Wallace, Jeff and Robby Gordon, both Bobby (the defending Cup Champion) and Terry Labonte, Mark Martin, Tony Stewart, Elliott Sadler, Jeff and Ward Burton (who had led the most laps in the race so far with 53), Jerry Nadeau, John Andretti, Buckshot Jones, Dale Jarrett (the defending Daytona 500 winner), and Andy Houston. The crash began when R. Gordon turned W. Burton at the exit of turn 2. Stewart got hit by W. Burton, turned backwards against the outside wall, and was pushed airborne over R. Gordon. Stewart then flipped over twice, hooking to B. Labonte's hood, and stood on his front wheels before coasting <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> the infield, while W. Burton's car turned sideways and collected most of the field behind him. Earnhardt, Ron Hornaday, Jr., Ricky Rudd and Ken Schrader were four of the few drivers who escaped the crash scene. The race was red-flagged to remove cars from the racetrack, and clean up debris.|$|E
500|$|The lower {{reaches of}} the Irwell have flooded many times in its history, the most well {{documented}} being the floods of 1866, 1946, 1954, 1980, 2007 and 2015. [...] In December 1816 rapidly thawing snow caused the river to flood, sweeping away {{a considerable amount of}} property including building materials and livestock. [...] Locals reported the height of the river to have been almost as great as a more serious flood of 1768. [...] A local public house, the Black Boy, suffered extensive damage as the water caused the rear wall to collapse, a local brewery was flooded with the loss of all its stock, and a Mersey Flat came free of its moorings, hitting Regent Bridge. In 1866, the [...] "year of the great Flood", rain fell for three continuous days commencing on Tuesday 13 November. By {{the end of the first}} day, the river had risen [...] above normal at Peel Park, street lamps could not be lit and mills were brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop.</b> <b>In</b> all, £1million of property was damaged, 450 hectares of land was flooded, 700people had to be rescued from wrecked homes, but only one man died by drowning. The height of the flood was marked by an obelisk erected in Peel Park. The construction of the ship canal is said to have reduced the risk of flooding, by providing [...] a larger outlet below Regent bridge. In 1946 in Salford 5,300properties were flooded, and 600 were flooded in 1954.|$|E

50|$|Before the 1970s, Mersin {{was used}} <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> {{scheduled}} sea voyages of Turkey. But after the maritime operators shortened their cruise destinations, Mersin {{is no more}} <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> scheduled voyages. Instead, it is now planned <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> international yachting tourism. The old marina, which was actually {{a part of the}} Mersin Harbour, is found to be insufficient for yacht traffic. While the old marina is now reserved for fishing boats, the new marina was constructed after 1994. In 2006, the operating rights were awarded to ERS İnşaat company within the scope of a build-operate-transfer project.|$|R

The park hosted a [...] "moderate number" [...] of visitors during the 1960s and 70s. Visitation came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> 1983 when floodwaters washed out the southern causeway.
