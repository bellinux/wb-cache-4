5|$|The {{day after}} the tournament closes, The Bobby Jones Scholars from The University of St Andrews in Scotland play a four-ball round on the course – the last people to do so before the greenkeepers start the process of {{repairing}} and restoring <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>to</b> pre-tournament standard.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} aspect of race preparation is grooming <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>to</b> provide a surface for skate-skiing and setting tracks for classic events. This takes into account snow physics, methods for packing snow and surface shaping, and the equipment used for these functions. Also key is the layout of grooming and track setting in the stadium with various formats for starts, finishes and intermediate functions for relays and pursuits.|$|E
5|$|As a {{preparation}} for the World Championships in Tuscany Van Dijk went during the season {{a few times to}} Italy to practise the time trial course. She trained at five in the morning to avoid traffic and made video recordings of <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>to</b> get to know the turns. In the week before the World Championships she won the French time trial Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen. All the preparations paid off and the World Championships were very successful for Van Dijk. With her team she won for the second consecutive year the world title in the team time trial. Because Van Dijk had won almost all the time trials this year she was also the main favourite for the individual time trial. Despite the pressure she won the time trial with a convincing victory and became the second Dutch women to win this title. At the end of the championships, Van Dijk finished 16th on a non-preferable hilly road race course.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2009 race, {{officials}} {{decided to}} advance the competition's start date by one week to better accommodate mushers also participating in the Iditarod. The 2010 race started in Fairbanks on February 6, 2010, and the early start date was kept for the 2011 competition. Hans Gatt won the 2010 race with the fastest finish in Yukon Quest history: 9days and 26minutes. That race was marked by good weather, and few mushers dropped out. In 2011, conditions returned to normal, as violent storms blasted the trail and mushers {{during the second half}} of the race. Only 13 of the 25 competitors completed the race, tying the record for fewest finishers. In 2013, poor trail conditions over American Summit forced the Dawson to Eagle section of <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>to</b> be rerouted over the Yukon River.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 Trump {{tried to}} move the Sybase Classic, a LPGA tournament, from Wykagyl Country Club to Trump's club for 2007; the Wykagyl lease would run out in that year. Briarcliff Manor's mayor Peter Chatsky was opposed to the plan; Trump {{attempted}} to persuade the mayor {{to talk to his}} wife, Jean Chatzky, about the financial benefit of hosting the tournament, adding that village residents would be hired for the event. A Trump Organization vice president suggested donating some proceeds to the Briarcliff Manor Public Library's then-proposed expansion or toward improving a village baseball field. The club's special-use permit with the village restricted <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>to</b> 300 people and banned large-scale tournaments from taking place there. The discussion between the Trump Organization and village government stopped that year, however in 2004, Trump submitted a new request to bring a LPGA or PGA tournament to the club.|$|E
5|$|The race's only {{individual}} {{time trial}} of an extensive length was held as an out-and-back loop around Villars-les-Dombes in the Ain department. The parcours of the -long stage was almost entirely flat. The stage finished at the Parc des Oiseaux, {{one of the}} largest ornithological parks in Europe. Race organisers had expected the quickest times for <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>to</b> be around forty minutes. Several of the general classification leaders regarded the time trial as a test for an individual time trial of similar length due to be held in July, at the Tour de France. As is customary in time trial stages, cyclists set off in reverse order from where they were ranked in the general classification {{at the end of the}} previous stage. Thus, Larry Warbasse of the , who was in 172nd place of the 176 starters, trailing overall leader David Veilleux by thirty-five minutes and fourteen seconds, was the first rider to set off on the stage.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the {{delivery}} of Australia's first C-17s, RAAF personnel received training on the aircraft in the United States. From May 2006 a group of pilots and loadmasters led by Wing Commander Linda Corbould, the commanding officer designate of No. 36 Squadron, undertook conversion training with the USAF's C-17 units at Altus Air Force Base and Charleston Air Force Base. A group of 48 technical personnel also received training at Charleston and McChord Air Force Base from September that year. No. 36 Squadron began a period of intensive training once Corbould delivered A41-206 to Amberley on 7 December 2006, and the unit achieved initial operating capability status in September 2007. Also in 2007, the RAAF's No. 1 Air Operations Support Squadron was expanded by 80 personnel to provide air load teams to support the Globemasters. A project to acquire the equipment needed to allow the RAAF's C-17s {{to be used in}} the aeromedical evacuation role and develop associated crew procedures began in late 2007. The first Globemaster aeromedical evacuation sortie was flown on 5 September 2008, the day after the type was certified to operate in this role. On 8 December 2008, Corbould led the RAAF's first all-female aircrew during a training flight over South East Queensland to mark the second anniversary of the entry of the Globemaster into service. A team of USAF trainers was posted to Amberley until the RAAF had sufficient C-17 pilots who were qualified to instruct others. The RAAF began training new C-17 pilots in early 2010 after the flight simulator was delivered, and the first Australian-trained pilots graduated in early May that year. No. 36 Squadron achieved final operating capability status in December 2011. The components for a simulated C-17 cargo compartment were delivered to Amberley in early 2013, and this facility was commissioned in November that year. The simulator is used to train air movements and medical staff as well as to develop and trial new cargo carrying techniques for the C-17s. The first Australian-trained Globemaster loadmasters graduated in mid-2014. The final element of C-17 aircrew training to be routinely conducted in the United States was <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>to</b> qualify co-pilots as aircraft captains. This course was relocated to Australia in mid-2017.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} raise {{awareness}} prior to the championships, the city and Polish athletics association organised a weekly cross country run (the Cross Bydgoski) every Sunday on the race course from 25 October onwards.

25|$|Some African American {{students}} have reported feeling that their self-esteem {{has been raised}} by the class.

The class does not always relate the topics of <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>to</b> issues related to race and racism that are present today. Some students praise the course because it adds representation in an otherwise fairly Euro-centric curriculum.|$|E

If a player is marked with paint, they will call him out, but competitors may also be expected to follow the honor code; a broken ball means elimination. Field operators may specify variations to this rule, such as requiring a tag to certain body locations only – such as the head and torso only. There are game rules that can be enforced depending on the venue, to ensure safety, balance the fairness of the game or eliminate cheating.|$|E
