Focused on music and fashion, the subculture {{has its roots in}} a small group of stylish London-based young men in the late 1950s who were termed modernists because they listened to modern jazz.|$|E
500|$|An {{article in}} the American Criminal Law Review, {{published}} in 2011 by Stacey Kime, disagreed with some of Hewett's arguments. Kime argued that [...] "it is well settled that criminal defendants have {{a constitutional right to}} present exculpatory evidence", disagreeing with the idea that the basis for a robust defense had been gutted. Instead, she blamed the [...] "incoherent" [...] standard <b>today</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lack of understanding of where the [...] "source of this constitutional right" [...] to have a strong defense lies. Unlike Hewett, who targeted post-Washington decisions, Kime believed that there were flaws in the Washington opinion itself. Specifically, she argued that [...] "the Court's reasoning was not only unnecessary, but the Washington doctrine itself is inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment's history and text".|$|E
500|$|Christopher Reeve, {{star of the}} Superman films, {{expressed}} his approval of the show:I {{was a little bit}} skeptical when I heard about [...] at first, but I must say the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology <b>today</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when I first heard about the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom {{is doing a good job}} following the tradition.|$|E

2500|$|Fort Hawkins {{guarded the}} Lower Creek Pathway, an {{extensive}} and well-traveled American Indian network later improved by the United States as the Federal Road from Washington, D.C., to the ports of Mobile, Alabama and New Orleans, Louisiana. A gathering {{point of the}} Creek and U.S. cultures for trading, {{it was also a}} center of state militia and federal troops. The fort served as a major military distribution point during the War of 1812 against Great Britain and also during the Creek War of 1813. Afterward, the fort was used as a trading post for several years and was garrisoned until 1821. It was decommissioned about 1828 and later burned to the ground. A replica of the southeast blockhouse was built in 1938 and stands <b>today</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> hill in east Macon. [...] Part of the fort site is occupied by the Fort Hawkins Grammar School. In the twenty-first century, archeological excavations have revealed more of the fort's importance, and stimulated planning for additional reconstruction of this major historical site.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was as a}} {{rewrite man}} for the Daily News in 1947 that Smith had what he later called [...] "perhaps my finest hour as a newspaperman": his stories on the infamous Elizabeth Short murder case. The police beat {{reporter}} phoned in the bulletin to Smith, who recounted the moment this way in his book Jack Smith's L.A.: [...] "Within the minute I had written {{what may have been}} the first sentence ever written on the Black Dahlia case. I can't remember it word for word, but my lead went pretty much like this: 'The nude body of a young woman, neatly cut in two at the waist, was found early <b>today</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> vacant lot near Crenshaw and Exposition Boulevards.'" [...] His editor added one adjective, making Short [...] "a beautiful young woman ... Our city editor, of course, no more knew what the unfortunate young woman had looked like than I did ... But the lesson was clear. On the Daily News, at least, all young women whose nude bodies were found in two pieces on vacant lots were beautiful. I never forgot it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Redlining {{is related}} to {{steering}} because it is denying financial support and services to neighborhoods based on race, ethnicity, or economic status. Rather than subtly steering individual families towards certain areas or only giving them information on certain racial areas, redlining was a blatant but legally tolerated criterion for financial institutions to decide where to invest. Originating in the New Deal, this procedure was a protocol for deciding where federal, state and city funds would go for financial services. Affluent middle- and upper-middle-class white areas were outlined in green on a map, meaning that financial services were clear to be rendered and these areas were desirable for investment. [...] Racial areas, specifically African-American neighborhoods, were outlined in red, meaning they were undesirable neighborhood whose denizens were poor and racially mixed. These maps were used by banking institutions to construct guidelines for lending money. As a consequence, many of these redlined areas, which were also typically located in urban environments as whites tended to move out to the suburbs of America, experienced deterioration on a rapid scale. Since these areas have been neglected and redlined and cannot receive funds from banks to revitalize, they cannot attract businesses, which perpetuates the cycle of poverty. The poverty often leads to crime, and neighborhoods become further neglected because {{they continue to be}} unattractive to outside investment, and continue to be redlined by banks. Thus private banks and financial institutions as well as the U.S. government are accused of being responsible for these practices in several instances, which before the Fair Housing Act were widespread and blatant throughout the United States. [...] Redlining is still practiced <b>today</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> more subtle level. Instead of having official maps circulated to institutions, which is illegal, the public domain may tend to ignore poor neighborhoods by denying basic public services.|$|E
