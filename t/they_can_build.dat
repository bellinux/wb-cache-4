5|$|At {{the funeral}} parlour, Rose wakes up {{along with the}} newly-reanimated corpses of Mrs. Peace and Mr. Redpath. The Doctor and Dickens arrive and break into the parlour {{just in time to}} rescue Rose. After hearing about the trouble with the corpses, the Doctor convinces Gwyneth to help him hold a séance to attempt to {{communicate}} with the dead. The blue vapors fill the room and reveal that they are the remains of the Gelth, a once-corporeal alien race until they were devastated by the Time War. They plead with the Doctor to open the rift that exists {{in the basement of the}} parlour and allow them to cross over. The Doctor offers the Gelth temporary use of the corpses until he can transport them to a place where <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>build</b> new bodies, using Gwyneth as a bridge to cross the Rift.|$|E
5|$|Cryptum {{takes place}} {{approximately}} 100,000 {{years before the}} present day in the Halo universe, {{telling the story of}} the Forerunners before their disappearance. It revolves around the journey of a young Forerunner, Bornstellar, and two humans, Chakas and Morning Riser, and how their lives change when they meet a Forerunner warrior, the Didact. The Forerunners are a type-three civilization on the Kardashev scale; <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>build</b> artificial planets and control stars. Forerunners are divided into classes by occupation, they are (in order of rank): Builders, the architects of the Forerunners' megastructures, Miners, Lifeworkers, experts in medicine and biology, and Warriors. Bornstellar's family are politically important Builders and particularly wealthy, enabling them to own an entire planet. Warriors introduced in this book called Prometheans were later featured as antagonists in the video game Halo 4.|$|E
5|$|The Venezuelan intern Jhonny (JC Gonzalez) {{falls in}} love with April (Aubrey Plaza), who convinces him she is feared and very powerful. Jhonny is crazy and fell in love for April and sent her his car to pick her up but she used his car to go to movies with her friends. Meanwhile, Leslie tells the Venezuelans that she is seeking to raise $35,000 to fill in a pit to make a park. Raul and his colleagues start to laugh, telling her they have so much money from oil, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>build</b> {{whatever}} they want. Leslie, who is growing increasingly annoyed with the Venezuelans, decides to take them to Pawnee's nicest park with hopes of impressing them. Instead, they are disgusted, and Raul mistakes the park for the aforementioned pit. Leslie later takes them to a public meeting to show them democracy in action, but all of the citizens shout angry and annoyed questions at Leslie. An unimpressed Raul wonders where are the armed guards to take the protestors to jail. When Raul tells Leslie they live like kings in Venezuela and answer to nobody, she explodes in anger, insulting their uniforms and Hugo Chavez. The Venezuelans storm out.|$|E

25|$|Since reviewers are {{normally}} selected from {{experts in the}} fields discussed in the article, the process of peer review helps to keep some invalid or unsubstantiated claims out {{of the body of}} published research and knowledge. Scholars will read published articles outside their limited area of detailed expertise, and then rely, to some degree, on the peer-review process to have provided reliable and credible research that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>build</b> upon for subsequent or related research. Significant scandal ensues when an author is found to have falsified the research included in an article, as other scholars, and the field of study itself, may have relied upon the invalid research.|$|E
500|$|Military {{buildings}} include unit-producing buildings such as barracks, archery ranges, stables, and castles, {{as well as}} defensive buildings such as {{walls and}} towers. Military buildings can perform research to improve the abilities of military units, increasing their strength, defensive capabilities, or other attributes. Castles are a key offensive and defensive building as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>build</b> trebuchets, train the civilization's [...] "unique unit/s", and a hail of arrows at enemy units within range, with garrisoned units firing extra arrows.

[...] Instead of finding those values in the writings of contemporary theorists, Satin says they are just new versions of the values that inspired 18th-century American revolutionaries: liberty, equality, pursuit-of-happiness, and fraternity, respectively.

Russell Earl, ILM visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "The character that we did the most work on was Falcon. We {{knew we were going}} to do CG wings. We also did some shots with wires and some with stunt doubles and head replacement. And we needed a very good digital double." ...|$|E
500|$|Footage {{from the}} first episode was {{screened}} at New York Comic Con in October 2015, while the first trailer for the season was released in November.

Vanilla Ice stated that [...] "I wanted to express myself in a very intense way, and there was no way it was going to happen with a drum machine.

[...] Many critics have noticed a similarity between the style of music present on Hard to Swallow and that of bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Vanilla Ice stated that although he knew of the bands, he [...] "didn't even listen to [...] any of them" [...] before he made the album, and he was not trying to imitate the musical style of the bands. [...] "It's just we have the same producer, and some of the guitars between that and Limp Bizkit are gonna sound similar. That's what happens when you've got the same guy producing them.

Also in multiplayer, when all three player controlled characters are fighting a strong enemy, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>build</b> up a combo chain. When the chain is sufficiently long, the players enter [...] "Hero Mode," [...] which results in much stronger attacks. To build up the combo chain, the player must continuously land successful attacks without being hit.

50|$|A polyrotaxane {{is a type}} of {{mechanically}} interlocked molecule (MIM) {{consisting of}} strings and rings, in which multiple rings are threaded onto a molecular axle and prevented from dethreading by two bulky end groups. More interestingly, as oligomeric or polymeric species of rotaxanes, polyrotaxanes are also capable of converting energy input to molecular movements because the ring motions can be controlled by external stimulus. Polyrotaxanes have attracted much attention for decades, because <b>they</b> <b>can</b> help <b>build</b> functional molecular machines with complicated molecular structure.|$|R

2500|$|In resting cells, axin {{molecules}} oligomerize {{with each}} other through their C-terminal DIX domains, which have two binding interfaces. Thus <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>build</b> linear oligomers or even polymers inside the cytoplasm of cells. DIX domains are unique: the only other protein known to have a DIX domain is Dishevelled. (The single Dsh protein of Drosophila corresponds to three paralogous genes, Dvl1, Dvl2 and Dvl3 in mammals.) Dsh associates with the cytoplasmic regions of Frizzled receptors with its PDZ and DEP domains. When a Wnt molecule binds to Frizzled, it induces a poorly known cascade of events, that result in the exposure of dishevelled's DIX domain {{and the creation of}} a perfect binding site for axin. Axin is then titrated away from its oligomeric assemblies – the β-catenin destruction complex – by Dsh. Once bound to the receptor complex, axin will be rendered incompetent for β-catenin binding and GSK3 activity. Importantly, the cytoplasmic segments of the Frizzled-associated LRP5 and LRP6 proteins contain GSK3 pseudo-substrate sequences (Pro-Pro-Pro-Ser-Pro-x-Ser), appropriately [...] "primed" [...] (pre-phosphorylated) by CKI, as if it were a true substrate of GSK3. These false target sites greatly inhibit GSK3 activity in a competitive manner. [...] This way receptor-bound axin will abolish mediating the phosphorylation of β-catenin. Since beta-catenin is no longer marked for destruction, but continues to be produced, its concentration will increase. Once β-catenin levels rise high enough to saturate all binding sites in the cytoplasm, it will also translocate into the nucleus. Upon engaging the transcription factors LEF1, TCF1, TCF2 or TCF3, β-catenin forces them to disengage their previous partners: Groucho proteins. Unlike Groucho, that recruit transcriptional repressors (e.g. histone-lysine methyltransferases), beta-catenin will bind transcriptional activators, switching on target genes.|$|E

25|$|People {{are more}} likely to {{cooperate}} on a task if <b>they</b> <b>can</b> communicate with one another first.

Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population.
