5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense <b>things</b> <b>before</b> they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon {{be taken off the}} ship.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Rihanna walking towards a white Jeep Wrangler, but stops {{due to her}} mobile phone ringing. As Rihanna answers, she converses with a male friend, presumably her boyfriend. As she tells him {{that she needs to}} do some <b>things</b> <b>before</b> meeting with him, Rihanna hangs up and the screen cuts to a black screen. As a visual of Rihanna driving along a bridge in the Florida Keys, the song begins to play. During the first verse, {{different}} scenes are intercut of Rihanna, including a close-up shot of the singer driving behind the wheel is shown, walking along the beach and dancing in a black dress against a white backdrop, as she sings about how her boyfriend has been seeing another girl without Rihanna knowing. For the first chorus, in addition to the other three scenes, one shot is shown of Rihanna dancing with a man in a nightclub. During the second verse, Rihanna is shown lying down on the beach and playing in the water, as well as dancing with a male dancer against a white backdrop, this time wearing a lace dress.|$|E

25|$|The {{worn-out}} {{fabric of}} old clothing {{was used for}} baby clothes because soft cloth {{was good for the}} skin of babies and worn-out material protected babies from gods of illness and demons due to these gods' abhorrence of dirty <b>things.</b> <b>Before</b> a baby was breast-fed, he/she was given a decoction of the endodermis of alder and the roots of butterburs to discharge impurities. Children were raised almost naked until about the ages of four to five. Even when they wore clothes, they did not wear belts and left the front of their clothes open. Subsequently, they wore bark clothes without patterns, such as attush, until coming of age.|$|E

500|$|A tightly-fought {{match against}} Chelsea {{at home was}} settled by a second half error by goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini, which {{presented}} Henry with his seventh league goal in nine matches. Both teams up until that point were level on points {{at the top of}} the table and unbeaten. Wenger noted after the match that Chelsea's bigger squad would serve them well as the season progressed, but stressed his smaller squad had stability: [...] "We have been together for years and have the comfort of knowing we have won <b>things</b> <b>before.</b> When we are challenged, we become even more united." [...] Arsenal ended October with a 1–1 draw against Charlton Athletic. After 10 games, Arsenal garnered 24 points. The point earnt at Charlton was enough for the team to move back into first position, which had been occupied by Chelsea.|$|E
500|$|Seeing {{that his}} initial {{pronouncement}} {{did nothing to}} quell the controversy surrounding the faults of popular nature writing, Roosevelt finally responded to Long's ongoing criticism {{in the fall of}} 1907. His article, which was written under his own name and simply titled [...] "Nature Fakers", was published in the September issue of Everybody's Magazine. Beginning with a list of nature writers that the President admired and felt best represented the genre (Burroughs, Muir, and Olive Thorne Miller, among others), he soon fell into criticizing the [...] "yellow journalists of the woods" [...] who [...] "can easily believe three impossible <b>things</b> <b>before</b> breakfast; and they do not mind in the least if the impossibilities are mutually contradictory". While he focused on the [...] "nature fakers", especially Long, he shifted the focus of his attack to place responsibility not on the authors, but on their publishers and the school boards who regularly accepted their works for reading material. He wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|A {{rough cut}} of the premiere was leaked onto the {{internet}} {{three weeks before the}} scheduled series premiere. This attracted much media attention and discussion amongst fans, and caused interest in the show to skyrocket. The BBC released a statement that the source of the leak appears to be connected to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which responded by stating that they [...] "are looking into it. That's all I can say at this point because we don't know exactly what happened. It certainly wasn't done intentionally." [...] Asa Bailey, founder of the Viral Advertising Association, said that the BBC hired them for viral marketing strategies, and that he told them [...] "they should release <b>things</b> <b>before</b> their time", to create a [...] "cool factor". Both the BBC and CBC denied any involvement, but Bailey believes that to be disingenuous, saying that it is [...] "the best viral advert they could have done". The leak was ultimately traced to a third party company in Canada which had a legitimate preview copy. The employee responsible was fired by the company.|$|E

500|$|Michael Tedder of Vulture {{awarded the}} episode—along with [...] "Junior Salesman"—four stars out of five. He enjoyed Kevin's telling off the Senator for his poor {{treatment}} {{of his friends}} and family, and said [...] "that it came with Kevin's halting delivery just made it better." [...] However, he was critical of the Brian subplot, calling it [...] "the least interesting way this camera crew reveal could have gone". Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode a 7 out of 10, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode. Despite noting that the show itself was still good in comparison to much of television, Cornet wrote that the episode {{is an example of the}} [...] "danger of needlessly dragging things out, as we have seen the waste of ending <b>things</b> <b>before</b> they have had the opportunity to reach their full potential in the past." [...] Cornet praised Kevin's [...] "truth bomb", writing that it [...] "worked beautifully", but she called [...] "the 'man behind the curtain' reveal ... a bitter disappointment" [...] and a [...] "cop-out" [...] to engage the audience.|$|E
500|$|After the Seven Network dropped Neighbours in 1985, rival channel Network Ten {{picked the}} series up. It {{initially}} attracted low ratings and Ten began {{working hard to}} publicise the series. They revamped the show and added several new cast members. Kylie Minogue had had a fairly successful career as a child actress, having appeared in various television dramas, including Skyways and The Henderson Kids, but she was considering giving up acting after failing to find further work. After finishing her school exams in 1985, Minogue then auditioned {{for the role of}} Charlene. She attended the audition dressed as the character and won the role. Of hiring Minogue, Neighbours casting director Jan Russ commented [...] "Kylie had done a couple of <b>things</b> <b>before</b> I saw her, but she was only 18 and as shy as a mouse. She really hadn't evolved into anything at that stage, but the camera loved her and I knew I had my Charlene." [...] Minogue initially signed up to play Charlene for one week, this was then extended to 13 weeks and then through to mid-1988. She made her debut screen appearance in the episode broadcast on 17 April 1986.|$|E
500|$|On 21 June 1941, {{while he}} was in the middle of playing a game of cricket, Wodehouse {{received}} a visit from two members of the Gestapo. He was given ten minutes to pack his <b>things</b> <b>before</b> he was taken to the Hotel Adlon, a top luxury hotel in Berlin. He stayed there at his own expense; royalties from the German editions of his books had been put into a special frozen bank account at the outset of the war, and Wodehouse was permitted to draw upon this money he had earned whilst [...] staying in Berlin. He was thus released from internment a few months before his sixtieth birthday—the age at which civilian internees were released by the Nazis. Shortly afterwards Wodehouse was, in the words of Phelps, [...] "cleverly trapped" [...] into making five broadcasts to the US via German radio, with the Berlin-based correspondent of the Columbia Broadcasting System. The broadcasts—aired on 28 June, 9, 23 and 30 July, and 6 August—were titled How to be an Internee Without Previous Training, and comprised humorous anecdotes about Wodehouse's experiences as a prisoner, including some gentle mocking of captors. The German propaganda ministry arranged for the recordings to be broadcast to Britain in August. The day after Wodehouse recorded his final programme, Ethel joined him in Berlin, having sold most of her jewellery to pay for the journey.|$|E

500|$|While walking home, Marty {{experiences}} {{a vision of}} Gotts attacking Forester. Marty eventually makes {{her way to the}} crime scene where she finds the victim's body. She returns to the police station and confesses to the murders. To convince the police that she is the murderer, Marty tells Pennock where Gotts hid the heroin he stole from the first victim, but none of the prints on the heroin belong to Marty, furthering Mulder's argument that she is, in fact, innocent. Mulder approaches Marty and tells her that he researched her mother's murder—she died from a stab wound to the kidney, the same way Gotts kills his victims. Mulder concludes that Marty was given her ability when her then-pregnant mother was killed by Gotts; it is revealed that Gotts is actually Marty's father and that he had spent thirty years (her whole life) in prison until being paroled. Marty sends Mulder and Scully to the bar that Gotts was last seen at, while Pennock takes her back to her apartment to pick up some <b>things</b> <b>before</b> entering protective custody. While packing, Marty has a vision of Gotts in the apartment lobby; she knocks Pennock out, takes his gun and waits. [...] Mulder figures out that Marty had been experiencing Gotts' sight for the thirty years he was in prison; in effect spending her whole life in prison. Mulder and Scully arrive at Marty's apartment to find Gotts dead by his daughter's hands. Marty is convicted of his murder and is sentenced to prison, but she is finally free of her father's vision.|$|E
