5|$|From {{the core}} {{out to about}} 0.7 solar radii, thermal {{radiation}} is the primary means of energy transfer. The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core. This temperature gradient {{is less than the}} value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through <b>this</b> <b>zone</b> <b>is</b> by radiation instead of thermal convection. Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions. The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm3 to 0.2 g/cm3) from 0.25 solar radii to the 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.|$|E
5|$|KAL007's {{divergence}} {{prevented the}} aircraft from transmitting its position via shorter range {{very high frequency}} radio (VHF). It therefore requested KAL015, also en route to Seoul, to relay reports to air traffic control on its behalf. KAL007 requested KAL015 to relay its position three times. At 14:43UTC, KAL007 directly transmitted a change of {{estimated time of arrival}} for its next waypoint, NEEVA, to the international flight service station at Anchorage, but it did so over the longer range high frequency radio (HF) rather than VHF. HF transmissions are able to carry a longer distance than VHF, but are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference and static; VHF is clearer with less interference, and preferred by flight crews. The inability to establish direct radio communications to be able to transmit their position directly did not alert the pilots of KAL007 of their ever-increasing divergence and was not considered unusual by air traffic controllers. Halfway between Bethel and waypoint NABIE, KAL007 passed through the southern portion of the North American Aerospace Defense Command buffer zone. <b>This</b> <b>zone</b> <b>is</b> north of Romeo 20 and off-limits to civilian aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Elevation rise {{across the}} park results from land uplift along the Burnside-Eden fault zone. <b>This</b> <b>zone</b> <b>is</b> a major land fault {{separating}} the Adelaide Plains from the Mount Lofty Ranges and runs north-north-east across the park from its southwest corner. The park is underlain by neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Burra Group overlying a Precambrian crystalline basement. Sediments were formed approximately 700million years ago (mya) from sand washed into a shallow sea. Sand layers were then folded and slightly metamorphosed during the delamerian orogeny, {{a period of}} mountain building caused by tectonic plate movements and resulting east–west compression of Australia. This pushed up a mountain range, {{on the site of}} the present Mount Lofty Ranges, approximately 450mya. The range was eroded to a level plain over the following 350million years. Approximately 40mya, the location of today's ranges and plains were flat, with a hard sedimentary capping. About 2mya, block faulting raised the Mount Lofty Ranges, and much of the former land surface west of the ranges eroded away. The Gun Emplacement is a small remnant of this pre-erosion surface. It is a raised semi-circular flat area and has views over much of Adelaide from the southwestern corner of the park. The Emplacement is seen as an important regolith deposit, particularly for its role in understanding Adelaide's landscape's evolution. The Emplacement was declared a Geological Monument in 1978 for this geologic importance as well as its aesthetic and recreational value.|$|E

25|$|Zone 2: Peristome and trap entrance. <b>This</b> <b>zone</b> <b>is</b> {{composed}} {{mainly of}} the peristome, which produces copious amounts of nectar, luring insect prey to land or crawl onto the perilous footing surrounding the pitcher trap. This zone {{also includes the}} waxy upper portion of the pitcher tube.

25|$|In the {{far eastern}} part of the state the Chihuahuan Desert dominates due to low {{precipitation}} and extremely high temperatures; some areas of the {{eastern part of}} the state are so dry no vegetation is found like the Sand Dunes of Samalayuca. There are two distinctive climate zones found in the {{eastern part of the}} state: Hot Desert (BWh) and Cool Desert (BWk) which are differentiated by average annual temperature due to differences in elevation. There is a transition zone in the middle of the state between the two extremely different climates from the east and west; <b>this</b> <b>zone</b> <b>is</b> the Steppe characterized by a compromise between juxtaposed climate zones.|$|E

50|$|Riparian <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> {{transition}} <b>zones</b> {{between an}} upland terrestrial environment and an aquatic environment.

500|$|Coastal lowlands, or wet prairies, are {{salt water}} marshes that absorb marine water {{when it gets}} high or fresh water when rains are heavy. Floods occur during {{hurricane}} and tropical storm surges when ocean water can rise several feet over the land. Heavy wet seasons also cause floods when rain from the north flows into the Everglades. Few trees can survive in the conditions of this region, but plants—succulents like saltwort and glasswort—tolerate salt, brackish water, and desert conditions. [...] Animal life in <b>this</b> <b>zone</b> <b>is</b> dependent upon {{the amount of water}} present, but commonly found animals include Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), Everglades snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis), [...] wood stork (Mycteria americana), eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi), and small mammals such as rats, mice, and rabbits.|$|E
500|$|Two such terranes {{that now}} {{form part of}} the Canadian shield {{collided}} about [...] These were the Superior province and the large Minnesota River Valley terrane, the former composed mainly of granite and the latter of gneiss. This led to the mountain-building episode known as the Algoman orogeny in the U. S. [...] (named for Algoma, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin), and the Kenoran orogeny in Canada. Its duration is estimated at 50 to 100million years. The current boundary between these terranes {{is known as the}} Great Lakes tectonic zone (GLTZ). <b>This</b> <b>zone</b> <b>is</b> [...] wide and extends in a line roughly 1,200kilometers long from the middle of South Dakota, east through the middle of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, into the Sudbury, Ontario region.

500|$|Purkinje cells {{also receive}} {{input from the}} {{inferior}} olivary nucleus on the contralateral side of the brainstem via climbing fibers. Although the inferior olive lies in the medulla oblongata and receives input from the spinal cord, brainstem and cerebral cortex, its output goes entirely to the cerebellum. A climbing fiber gives off collaterals to the deep cerebellar nuclei before entering the cerebellar cortex, where it splits into about 10 terminal branches, each of which gives input to a single Purkinje cell. In striking contrast to the 100,000-plus inputs from parallel fibers, each Purkinje cell receives input from exactly one climbing fiber; but this single fiber [...] "climbs" [...] the dendrites of the Purkinje cell, winding around them and making a total of up to 300 synapses as it goes. The net input {{is so strong that}} a single action potential from a climbing fiber is capable of producing an extended complex spike in the Purkinje cell: a burst of several spikes in a row, with diminishing amplitude, followed by a pause during which activity is suppressed. The climbing fiber synapses cover the cell body and proximal dendrites; <b>this</b> <b>zone</b> <b>is</b> devoid of parallel fiber inputs.|$|E
