Some pseudohalides of chlorine are also known, such as cyanogen chloride (ClCN, linear), chlorine cyanate (ClNCO), chlorine <b>thiocyanate</b> (ClSCN, unlike its oxygen counterpart), and chlorine azide (ClN3).|$|E
5|$|However, {{the most}} {{important}} oxidation state for silver in complexes is +1. The Ag+ cation is diamagnetic, like its homologues Cu+ and Au+, as all three have closed-shell electron configurations with no unpaired electrons: its complexes are colourless provided the ligands are not too easily polarized such as I−. Ag+ forms salts with most anions, but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water: the exceptions are the nitrate, perchlorate, and fluoride. The tetracoordinate tetrahedral aqueous ion + is known, but the characteristic geometry for the Ag+ cation is 2-coordinate linear. For example, silver chloride dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form +; silver salts are dissolved in photography due {{to the formation of}} the thiosulfate complex 3−; and cyanide extraction for silver (and gold) works by the formation of the complex −. Silver cyanide forms the linear polymer {Ag–C≡N→Ag–C≡N→}; silver <b>thiocyanate</b> has a similar structure, but forms a zigzag instead because of the sp3-hybridized sulfur atom. Chelating ligands are unable to form linear complexes and thus silver(I) complexes with them tend to form polymers; a few exceptions exist, such as the near-tetrahedral diphosphine and diarsine complexes +.|$|E

[3, 3]-Sigmatropic shifts (hetero-Cope rearrangements) of the corresponding allyl, propargyl, benzyl, and aryl derivatives causes allylic rearrangements, propargyl allenyl rearrangement, conversion of benzyl cyanates to o-isocyanatotoluenes, and conversion of N-cyanatoarylamines to o-isocyanatoanilines, etc. The corresponding rearrangements of allyl <b>thiocyanates,</b> arylamino <b>thiocyanates</b> and isothiocyanates, and arylsulfenyl <b>thiocyanates</b> and isothiocyanates are also described...|$|R

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of moscovium {{in aqueous solution}} should essentially be that of the Mc+ and Mc3+ ions. The former should be easily hydrolyzed and not be easily complexed with halides, cyanide, and ammonia. Moscovium(I) hydroxide (McOH), carbonate (Mc2CO3), oxalate (Mc2C2O4), and fluoride (McF) should be soluble in water; the sulfide (Mc2S) should be insoluble; and the chloride (McCl), bromide (McBr), iodide (McI), and <b>thiocyanate</b> (McSCN) should be only slightly soluble, so that adding excess hydrochloric acid would not noticeably affect the solubility of moscovium(I) chloride. Mc3+ should be about as stable as Tl3+ and hence should also be {{an important part of}} moscovium chemistry, although its closest homolog among the elements should be its lighter congener Bi3+. Moscovium(III) fluoride (McF3) and thiozonide (McS3) should be insoluble in water, similar to the corresponding bismuth compounds, while moscovium(III) chloride (McCl3), bromide (McBr3), and iodide (McI3) should be readily soluble and easily hydrolyzed to form oxyhalides such as McOCl and McOBr, again analogous to bismuth. Both moscovium(I) and moscovium(III) should be common oxidation states and their relative stability should depend greatly on what they are complexed with and the likelihood of hydrolysis.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} tests {{can be used to}} detect the {{presence}} of a peroxide in an ether; one is to use a combination of iron(II) sulfate and potassium <b>thiocyanate.</b> The peroxide is able to oxidize the Fe2+ ion to an Fe3+ ion, which then forms a deep-red coordination complex with the <b>thiocyanate.</b>|$|E
25|$|An older cyanide {{antidote}} kit included {{administration of}} three substances: amyl nitrite pearls (administered by inhalation), sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate. The {{goal of the}} antidote was to generate a large pool of ferric iron (Fe3+) to compete for cyanide with cytochrome a3 (so that cyanide will bind to the antidote rather than the enzyme). The nitrites oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which competes with cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion. Cyanmethemoglobin is formed and the cytochrome oxidase enzyme is restored. The major mechanism to remove the cyanide from the body is by enzymatic conversion to <b>thiocyanate</b> by the mitochondrial enzyme rhodanese. <b>Thiocyanate</b> is a relatively non-toxic molecule and is excreted by the kidneys. To accelerate this detoxification, sodium thiosulfate is administered to provide a sulfur donor for rhodanese, {{needed in order to}} produce <b>thiocyanate.</b>|$|E

25|$|Haloalkanes {{react with}} ionic nucleophiles (e.g. cyanide, <b>thiocyanate,</b> azide); the halogen is {{replaced}} by the respective group. This is of great synthetic utility: chloroalkanes are often inexpensively available. For example, after undergoing substitution reactions, cyanoalkanes may be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids, or reduced to primary amines using lithium aluminium hydride. Azoalkanes may be reduced to primary amines by the Staudinger reduction or lithium aluminium hydride. Amines may also be prepared from alkyl halides in amine alkylation, the Gabriel synthesis and Delepine reaction, by undergoing nucleophilic substitution with potassium phthalimide or hexamine respectively, followed by hydrolysis.|$|E

Iodine, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and peracetic acid also fail this test (one hour treatment). Only chlorine, phenolic compounds, guanidinium <b>thiocyanate,</b> and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) reduce prion levels by more than 4 logs; chlorine (too corrosive to use on certain objects) and NaOH are the most consistent.

25|$|Several {{mutations}} in the CFTR gene can occur, and different mutations cause different defects in the CFTR protein, sometimes causing a milder or more severe disease. These protein defects are also targets for drugs which can sometimes restore their function. ΔF508-CFTR, which occurs in >90% {{of patients in}} the U.S., creates a protein that does not fold normally and is not appropriately transported to the cell membrane, resulting in its degradation. Other mutations result in proteins that are too short (truncated) because production is ended prematurely. Other mutations produce proteins that do not use energy (in the form of ATP) normally, do not allow chloride, iodide, and <b>thiocyanate</b> to cross the membrane appropriately, and degrade {{at a faster rate}} than normal. Mutations may also lead to fewer copies of the CFTR protein being produced.|$|E
25|$|A sample {{containing}} {{inorganic cyanide}} is purged with air from a boiling acid solution into a basic absorber solution. The cyanide salt {{absorbed in the}} basic solution is buffered at pH 4.5 and then reacted with chlorine to form cyanogen chloride. The cyanogen chloride formed couples pyridine with barbituric acid to form a strongly colored red dye that {{is proportional to the}} cyanide concentration. This colorimetric method following distillation is the basis for most regulatory methods (for instance EPA 335.4) used to analyze cyanide in water, wastewater, and contaminated soils. Distillation followed by colorimetric methods, however, {{have been found to be}} prone to interferences from <b>thiocyanate,</b> nitrate, thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfide that can result in both positive and negative bias. It has been recommended by the USEPA (MUR March 12, 2007) that samples containing these compounds be analyzed by Gas-Diffusion Flow Injection Analysis—Amperometry.|$|E
25|$|The protein spans this {{membrane}} {{and acts}} as a channel connecting the inner part of the cell (cytoplasm) to the surrounding fluid. This channel is primarily responsible for controlling the movement of halogens from inside to outside of the cell; however, in the sweat ducts, it facilitates the movement of chloride from the sweat duct into the cytoplasm. When the CFTR protein does not resorb ions in sweat ducts, chloride and <b>thiocyanate</b> released from sweat glands are trapped inside the ducts and pumped to the skin. Additionally hypothiocyanite, OSCN, cannot be produced by the immune defense system. Because chloride is negatively charged, this modifies the electrical potential {{inside and outside the}} cell that normally causes cations to cross into the cell. Sodium is the most common cation in the extracellular space. The excess chloride within sweat ducts prevents sodium resorption by epithelial sodium channels and the combination of sodium and chloride creates the salt, which is lost in high amounts in the sweat of individuals with CF. This lost salt forms the basis for the sweat test.|$|E
