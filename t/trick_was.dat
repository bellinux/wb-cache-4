5|$|Another common <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> {{to swallow}} 30 to 50 unshelled {{hazelnuts}} (although {{one of his}} posters advertised 40 pecans), followed by another nut of a different variety, such as an almond. Ali then brought them up one by one with the odd-nut-out produced at a mark called out by the audience. In another trick, Ali swallowed three to six handkerchiefs of different hues and then produced them in a color order requested by audience members.|$|E
5|$|A hat-trick in cricket {{is when a}} bowler {{takes three}} wickets on {{consecutive}} deliveries, dismissing three different batsmen. It is a relatively rare event in One Day International (ODI) cricket with only 43 occurrences in more than 3,800 matches since the first ODI, between Australia and England on 5 January 1971. The first ODI hat-trick was taken by Jalal-ud-Din of Pakistan, playing against Australia in Hyderabad, Sindh in September 1982 and the first world cup hat <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> taken by Chetan Sharma of India against New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|By 11:04, Lindmayr's Dorniers {{had reached}} Calais. Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, Park’s senior fighter controller, watched with the Prime Minister and Park as the Germans moved closer. De Broke {{had a problem}} of his own. He {{had no way of}} knowing which plots {{represented}} bombers and fighters. Bombers had to be intercepted, fighters could be ignored. The <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> to strike a balance and time the interception as well as possible. On one hand he must scramble early and allow enough time to get into a favourable attack position; but on the other hand he had to avoid scrambling them too early lest the fighters run short of fuel before they met the enemy. Park joined de Broke. After a brief discussion he decided to commit several squadrons from RAF Biggin Hill. Park realised the raid could be a trap. Though the target seemed to be London, the aircraft, comprising 120–150 in number, may be an advanced guard of Bf 109s sent to clear the skies or disrupt fighter defences. Still, he gambled and sent nine squadrons into action at 11:15.|$|E

25|$|Mawari-butai (revolving stage) {{developed}} in the Kyōhō era (1716–1735). The <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> originally accomplished by the on-stage pushing of a round, wheeled platform. Later a circular platform was embedded in the stage with wheels beneath it facilitating movement. The kuraten (“darkened revolve”) technique involves lowering the stage lights during this transition. More commonly the lights are left on for akaten (“lighted revolve”), sometimes simultaneously performing the transitioning scenes for dramatic effect. This stage was first built in Japan in the early eighteenth century.|$|E

25|$|While each playwright {{will take}} {{his or her}} own approach, Kenneth Cavander, the playwright who {{undertook}} and completed this task for Timon of Athens felt that the <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> to leave what is immediate and alive to our ears in the original untouched and only elsewhere to unpack whatever might hinder the free flow of the story {{in a way that is}} clear, not over-reverent, and above all, actable, so that the result is clear and compelling to a contemporary audience while preserving the spirit of the original.|$|E
25|$|Already in the 1920s Thoralf Skolem {{showed that}} any Diophantine {{equation}} {{is equivalent to}} one of degree 4 or less. His <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> to introduce new unknowns by equations setting them equal to the square of an unknown or the product of two unknowns. Repetition of this process results {{in a system of}} second degree equations; then an equation of degree 4 is obtained by summing the squares. So every Diophantine set is trivially of degree 4 or less. It is not known whether this result is best possible.|$|E
25|$|To deceive the Americans {{into believing}} {{there were more}} British troops than there {{actually}} were, Brock's force carried out several bluffs. At the suggestion of Major Thomas Evans, the Brigade Major at Fort George, Brock gave his militia the cast-off uniforms of the 41st Regiment to make Hull believe most of the British force were regulars. The troops were told to light individual fires instead of one fire per unit, thereby creating {{the illusion of a}} much larger army. They marched to take up positions in plain sight of the Americans then quickly ducked behind entrenchments, and marched back out of sight to repeat the manoeuvre. The same <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> carried out during meals, where the line would dump their beans into a hidden pot, then return out of view to rejoin the end of the queue.|$|E

5000|$|An [...] "ollie impossible" [...] {{involves}} the vertical 360-degree {{rotation of the}} board around the skater's back or front foot—the board rolls around the foot similar to the spinning of a baton around one's hand.

When the <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> executed with the front foot, the <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> named a [...] "front-foot impossible".

25|$|The rat {{trick is}} a celebration popularized by fans of the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League (NHL) during their 1995–96 season and trip to the 1996 Stanley Cup Finals. The term, a play on hat <b>trick,</b> <b>was</b> coined by Panthers goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck after {{teammate}} Scott Mellanby killed a rat {{in the locker room}} prior to the team's home opener with his stick, then scored two goals with the same stick. Fans immediately picked up on the idea and began throwing plastic rats on the ice to celebrate goals. By the time the Panthers reached the 1996 playoffs, thousands of rats hit the ice after every Panthers goal, resulting in an off-season rule change by the NHL that allowed for referees to penalize the home team if fans disrupt the game by throwing objects onto the ice.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{itself was}} smaller in scale when {{compared}} to the Battle of Ticinus. Although Fabius was not duped by Hannibal’s moves, his blocking force at the pass was. Leonard Cottrell, in his book “Hannibal: Enemy of Rome", wrote that the <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> designed to be recognized by Fabius as a trick. Hannibal had studied the mind of his opponent, and devised a plan to make him do exactly what Hannibal needed him to do. Fabius thought Hannibal was {{trying to get him to}} fight a night action over broken, uneven ground, where Roman infantry would lose their greatest advantages of discipline and teamwork, as their formations would become disorganized. Since Hannibal was choosing the battle ground and the hour, he might have sprung other surprises to gain further advantages on the Romans. Fabius predictably did what Hannibal had anticipated: nothing. The Romans guarding the pass, with no Fabius to keep them in check, thought they were doing their job when they rushed out, preventing a Carthaginian escape. Again, they acted as Hannibal had anticipated, and the Carthaginians took advantage of their actions to escape.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{was constructed in}} three sections to fulfill the established criteria. The first section, projecting outwards, had various workshops, cloakrooms and the foyer {{on the ground floor}} while upstairs it had a restaurant and a scenography studio. The second section housed the theatre proper. The boxes contained separate dressing rooms while the audience area was flat so that the hall could also be used as a ballroom. The third section, the stage, was designed in three sweeps with two lateral compartments large enough for backstage requirements. In his design for the horseshoe-shaped auditorium, Piermarini was inspired by the architecture of the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples but changed the degree of curvature so as to improve visibility and the acoustics. The acoustics were further enhanced by a number of subsequent modifications. For the ceiling, a finely decorated wooden facing served as a natural sounding board, ensuring almost perfect sound in every part of the hall. It was considered to be among the best of the times. Another little <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> to reduce significantly the size of the usually huge columns separating the various stages. For the hall's decor, Piermarini worked with prominent artists such as Giuseppe Levati and Giocondo Albertolli while also consulting the poet Giuseppe Parini. The theatre underwent many alterations during the Napoleonic period after which it lost its Neoclassical interiors as a result of work carried out by artists such as Francesco Hayez.|$|E

500|$|Remembering his {{experience}} with Shaoweng, the emperor turned cautious and tested Luan Da; he requested the mystic to display his power. Luan Da set down a chess board and, while chanting, caused the chess pieces to charge at one another. The emperor was reassured that Luan Da truly had power. The <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> achieved by coating the pieces {{in a mixture of}} rooster's blood, iron shavings, and [...] "magnetic dust". In Science and Civilisation in China (1986), Joseph Needham discusses the details of this feat and proposed that lodestone was likely used: powdered magnetite would not have been very effective.|$|E
