5|$|Departure from Beirut {{was delayed}} by about one hour. Originally {{scheduled}} to depart at 05:45, take-off took place only at 06:01. Less than 15 minutes later, two Arab passengers threatened <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> up the aircraft using explosives {{that had been}} hidden in the first class cabin (and which likely had been smuggled there in Damascus) if the members of Black September were not released from the German prison.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though all}} {{military}} activities ceased by 6 August 1933, exaggerated stories of atrocities {{committed by the}} Assyrians at Dirabun and the persistent anti-Christian propaganda and rumours insisted that the Christians were planning <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> bridges up and to poison drinking water in major Iraqi cities. According to some historians, the agitation against the Assyrians was also encouraged by Rashid Ali al-Gaylani's Arab nationalist government, which {{saw it as a}} distraction to the continuous Shiite revolt {{in the southern part of}} the country.|$|E
5|$|In Dead or Alive 4 (2005), Ayane {{has pledged}} {{her life to}} her {{half-brother}} and Mugen Tenshin clan leader Hayate, in his cause to destroy the DOATEC for the suffering the company has caused the ninja clans. Ayane has a threefold stake in this plot: she wants revenge for Raidou being changed into a monster, for Hayate being brainwashed {{in their attempt to}} realize Project Epsilon, and for the manipulation and death of Genra. At the end of the game, Ayane uses her ninpo ("ninja arts") spell <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> up the DOATEC Tri-Tower.|$|E

5|$|Over the {{remaining}} {{months of the}} year the division carried out patrols of the rail and road networks, which were being mined. Some of the mines killed men from the division attempting to disarm them, until orders were issued <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> the mines up rather than disarm them. Then on 2December a road mine killed four men from the 2nd Forward Observation Unit (Airborne).|$|E
5|$|The {{captain of}} a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> {{in the direction of}} travel. During the Age of Sail, the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access, and therefore had a direct effect on European empire-building and thus on modern political geography. For example, Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all.|$|E
5|$|A celebration {{broke out}} among the miners, who broke into liquor {{warehouses}} and saloons. That night, some of the miners loaded a flatcar with dynamite and attempted to roll it toward the deputies' camp. It overturned short of its goal and killed a cow. Other miners wanted <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> up every mine in the region, but Johnson quickly discouraged them. Frustrated, several drunken miners then stole a work train and steamed into Victor. They {{caught up with the}} group of fleeing deputies, and a gun battle broke out. One deputy and one miner died, a man on each side was wounded, and six strikers were captured by the deputies. The miners subsequently captured three officials of the Strong mine who had been present when the shafthouse was blown up. A formal prisoner exchange later freed all prisoners on both sides.|$|E

5|$|After Keen finds Molly tied up at {{the back}} of the Bloog Control Center on the space station, she {{explains}} to him that she was kidnapped on the orders of her younger brother, who Keen knows to be his nemesis Mortimer McMire. Mortimer convinced the Bloogs to kidnap her by offering them the Stupendous Sandwich of Chungella IV. Keen is surprised, as he thought Mortimer was dead (he was apparently killed at the end of the Vorticon trilogy), and is dismayed to find out that Mortimer plans <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> up the entire universe. This conclusion is also revealed in an encoded note at the end of the Galaxy. The game ends by asking the player to play the next installment, where Keen would again fight Mortimer.|$|E
5|$|Almost simultaneously, an {{explosion}} devastated the north {{wing of the}} Bath Consolidated School building, killing 36 schoolchildren and two teachers. Kehoe had used a timed detonator to ignite hundreds of pounds of dynamite and incendiary pyrotol, which he had secretly planted inside the school {{over the course of}} many months. As rescuers began working at the school, Kehoe drove up, stopped, and used a rifle to detonate dynamite inside his shrapnel-filled truck, killing himself, the school superintendent, and several others nearby, as well as injuring more bystanders. During rescue efforts at the school, searchers discovered an additional 500pounds (230kg) of unexploded dynamite and pyrotol connected to a timing device set to detonate {{at the same time as}} the first explosions; the material was hidden throughout the basement of the south wing. Kehoe had apparently intended <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> up and destroy the entire school.|$|E
5|$|Ambitious {{reporter}} Amy Harkin (Nancy McKeon) {{is stuck}} {{reporting on the}} heat wave while trying to find proof behind the scenes that Lexer and Midwest {{are responsible for the}} lack of sufficient power. The Secretary of Energy, Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president that the power grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters and that it is too vulnerable to attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of Lexer, has also repeatedly warned Lexer that their systems are too vulnerable to hackers, but the company is only interested in going with the cheapest options. He decides <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> the whistle on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the piece to air.|$|E

5|$|An {{elephant}} uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting {{its skin}} from ultraviolet light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular mud baths {{to protect it}} from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.|$|E
5|$|By morning, the UFO {{crash site}} has been sealed {{off by the}} government, who has put out a cover-story that claims a Taco Bell is being built. Douchebag visits Kupa Keep and learns that the Stick has again been stolen by the elves. Cartman and Kyle task Douchebag with {{recruiting}} the Goth kids for their respective sides, each claiming that the other has the Stick. Randy agrees to help Douchebag recruit the Goths after Douchebag infiltrates the crash site and discovers that government agents are plotting <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> up the town in order to destroy an alien goo released from the ship. The goo turns living creatures into Adolf Hitler-esque Nazi Zombies; an infected person escapes government containment, unleashing the virus on South Park.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to files}} {{recovered}} by Fisher in London (and made public by the president), the American public and Congress both believe that Iran is funding the Blacklist, and The United States and Iran are headed towards war. Looking for more solid proof of Iran's involvement, Fisher infiltrates Quds Force headquarters in Tehran(previously a U.S embassy). Inside, he discovers that Iran {{has nothing to}} do with the Blacklist, and that the files he recovered were planted by The Engineers in order to lure The United States into a war. Fisher narrowly escapes Tehran by using a Predator Drone <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> up the Iranian vehicles chasing him, causing an international incident.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{similarities}} between the perpetrators, the murders were compared by Czech media and experts to a mass murder that took place two years before in Frenštát pod Radhoštěm, another Moravian town lying 90km northwards. In the attack, a 57-year-old man, Antonín Blažek, attempted <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> up a block of flats after having been ordered to vacate his flat that had been foreclosed by creditors. He first blocked both exits from the building, and then removed and opened the main gas supply into the building's corridor. Interrupted, Blažek set the gas on fire before the gas could spread throughout the whole building. The explosion and subsequent fire, however, were large enough to demolish part of the building, killing Blažek and five other people immediately and wounding eleven others, one of whom died on 17 February 2015.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division {{arrive with}} {{infantry}} and armor. Although they inflict heavy casualties on the Germans, {{most of the}} paratroopers, along with Jackson, Mellish, and Horvath are killed, while Upham avoids fighting. Miller attempts <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> the bridge, but is shot and mortally wounded by Steamboat Willie, who has rejoined the Germans. Just before a Tiger tank reaches the bridge, an American P-51 Mustang flies overhead and destroys the tank, followed by American armored units which rout the remaining Germans. Witnessing Miller's shooting, Upham confronts Steamboat Willie and his group {{as they attempt to}} retreat. Steamboat Willie raises his hands in surrender, believing that Upham will accept because of their earlier encounter. Instead, Upham kills him, but lets the other Germans flee.|$|E
5|$|Frank and {{the group}} reach the sub, and they take control of it. After betraying the Man in Black, Widmore's men attack, but they manage to submerge. Jack then discovers the Man in Black planted the C4 in Jack's bag. Sayid sacrifices himself and runs off with the C4 {{as far away from}} the others as he could until it explodes. The {{explosion}} causes the submarine to sink, and Frank is knocked out after a door hits him. Frank revives and makes it {{to the surface of the}} water. He is found by Richard and Miles as they head for Hydra Island <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> up the Ajira plane. Frank convinces them to steal the plane and let him fly it. After much repair work and picking up Kate, Claire, and Sawyer, the plane takes off and heads for home.|$|E
