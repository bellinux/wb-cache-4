40|$|The human breast {{comprises}} three lineages: the luminal epithelial lineage, the myoepithelial lineage, and the mesenchymal lineage. It {{has been}} widely accepted that human breast neoplasia pertains only to the luminal epithelial lineage. In recent years, however, evidence has accumulated that neoplastic breast epithelial cells may be substantially more plastic in their differentiation repertoire than previously anticipated. Thus, along with an increasing availability of markers for the myoepithelial lineage, at least a partial differentiation towards this lineage is being revealed frequently. It has also become clear that conversions towards the mesenchymal lineage actually occur, referred to as epithelial to mesenchymal transitions. Indeed, some of the so-called myofibroblasts surrounding the <b>tumor</b> may <b>have</b> an <b>epithelial</b> <b>origin</b> rather than a mesenchymal origin. Because myoepithelial cells, epithelial to mesenchymal transition-derived cells, genuine stromal cells and myofibroblasts share common markers, we now need to define a more ambitious set of markers to distinguish these cell types in the microenvironment of the tumors. This is necessary because the different microenvironments may confer different clinical outcomes. The aim of this commentary is to describe some of the inherent complexities in defining cellular phenotypes in the microenvironment of breast cancer and to expand wherever possible on the implications for tumor suppression and progression...|$|R

40|$|Epithelial tumour or {{carcinoma}} is {{the most}} common cause of death in individual with cancer worldwide. Molecular basis of epithelial tumor is poorly understood. To elucidate the mechanism behind the abstractness of epithelial tumor, “Molecular Signature” is the more accurate and effective than possible standard approach. Microarray data analysis has made it possible to obtain high feature molecular snapshot of genes of an organism at various disease state and experimental conditions. In this study, we discussed the uncovering of molecular signature from epithelial tumor (Brain, Stomach, Cervical cancer) on the basis of relative fold change and potential biomarker ability in cancer. To explore the molecular signature in epithelial tumor, we compared the gene expression profile of brain, stomach, cervical cancer. From microarray analysis we found 201 exclusive set of common genes in <b>epithelial</b> <b>origin</b> tumor and from 201 genes, we are able to identify 10 genes that can be used as molecular signature for all types of cancer which <b>has</b> <b>epithelial</b> <b>origin.</b> Selected two genes (SERPINA 3, SH 3 GL 3) were experimentally validated by qRT-PCR in HeLa cell line. qRT-PCR established that these two genes are showing their up regulation with respect to Beta-Actin, which is a housekeeping gene. The identification of molecular signature has promising application for accurate detection, promote early diagnosis and screening of cancer...|$|R

Newman, and two Spermatophyta, Juniperus communis L. (J. communis) and Cotinus coggygria Scop. (C. coggygria), were screened against four human cells lines (A 549, MCF 7, TK 6 and U 937). Only the extracts of J. communis and C. coggygria showed marked cytotoxic effects, affecting both cell morphology and growth. A dose-dependent {{effect of these}} two extracts was also observed on the cell cycle distribution. Incubation of all the cell lines in a medium containing J. communis extract determined a remarkable accumulation of cells in the G 2 /M phase, whereas the C. coggygria extract induced {{a significant increase in}} the percentage of G 1 cells. The novelty of our findings stands on the observation that the two extracts, consistently, elicited coherent effects on the cell cycle in four cell lines, independently from their phenotype, as two of them <b>have</b> <b>epithelial</b> <b>origin</b> and grow adherent and two are lymphoblastoid and grow in suspension. Even the expression profiles of several proteins regulating cell cycle progression and cell death were affected by both extracts. LC-MS investigation of methanol extract of C. coggygria led to the identification of twelve flavonoids (compounds 1 – 11, 19) and eight polyphenols derivatives (12 – 18, 20), while in J. communis extract, eight flavonoids (21 – 28), a α-ionone glycoside (29) and a lignin (30) were found. Although many of these compounds have interesting individual biological activities, their natural blends seem to exert specific effects on the proliferation of cell lines either growing adherent or in suspension, suggesting potential use in fighting cancer...|$|R

40|$|The {{intermediate}} filament protein {{types of}} normal choroid plexus and ependymal tissue and their putative tumors were investigated. In normal human choroid plexus tissue, {{but not in}} ependyma, keratin could be demonstrated immunohistochemically. By immunoblotting, keratins 8, 18, and 19 were found, but glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was absent. In mouse and rat, choroid plexus epithelium and ependymal lining cells were keratin-positive. In addition, many ependymal cells were vimentin-positive. Keratin was immunohistochemically found in three of four choroid plexus papillomas, two of two choroid plexus carcinomas, and the lining cells of three neuroepithelial cysts. GFAP-positive cells were present in some choroid plexus tumors. In contrast, none of the eight ependymomas contained keratin, but all were strongly positive for GFAP. The results show that choroid plexus lining cells and choroid plexus <b>tumors</b> <b>have</b> true <b>epithelial</b> characteristics in their cytoskeleton, in contrast to ependymomas, which do not show keratin positivity but show glial filaments, as would be seen in astrocytic tumors...|$|R
40|$|Tumors {{produced}} by 2 -acetylaminofluorene occur with differing frequencies in various organs. The squamous-cell carcinomas of the auditory canal region, {{reported in the}} original experiment of Wilson, De Eds, and Cox (23), appear to be of particular interest. There has been considerable discussion in the literature as to their site of origin and mode of development. In our experiment this type of tumor was the most frequent one. This stimulated our interest in further investigation of the factors involved in their pathogenesis. Wilson, De Eds, and Cox (23) introduced 2 -acetylaminofluorene (hereafter referred to as 2 -AAF) as an experimental carcinogen in 1941. Their report included descriptions of tumors produced in the bladder, kidney, liver, lungs, and head, although the {{emphasis was placed on}} bladder tumors. In the experimental studies by Bielschowsky (2, 6), Harris (12), Cantarow, Paschkis, and Stasney (7), and Engel and Copeland (11), tumors developed in additional sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and reproductive organs.

40|$|The {{epithelium}} of {{the human}} fallopian tube (oviduct) and cervix were studied by histological, immunohistological, and ultrastructural methods {{with a view to}} establishing the nature of the so called "basal" and "reserve" cells. The results indicated that the "basal" cells of the oviductal epithelia were T lymphocytes, with a predominance of T cytotoxic and suppressor cells. A more heterogeneous inflammatory cell population was present in cervical epithelium, although once again T cytotoxic and suppressor cells were the most numerous subtype. The intraepithelial inflammatory cells were quite distinct from the cells commonly referred to as "reserve" cells (reserve cell hyperplasia), which <b>have</b> <b>epithelial</b> characteristics. The <b>origin</b> of the "reserve" cells is unclear, but they seem to arise within the epithelium. They probably represent an early sign of squamous metaplasia.

40|$|Abstract Background Plexiform angiomyxoid myofibroblastic tumor (PAMT) is a {{very rare}} mesenchymal tumor of the stomach. Here we report a case of pathologically {{confirmed}} PAMT with an unique cyst formation. Case presentation A 55 -year-old male with a 10 -year history of a gastric subepithelial tumor underwent computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Two cysts were observed in the tumor, and the cyst wall showed moderately high intensity on T 2 -weighted images compared with the gastric wall. On dynamic study, the cyst wall showed a gradual enhancement pattern, and prominent enhancement was observed in the delayed phase. Laparoscopic partial gastric resection was performed, and a pathological diagnosis of PAMT was rendered. Conclusion We present a rare case of gastric PAMT, which was uniquely presented as cysts. One of the cysts in the <b>tumor</b> <b>had</b> an <b>epithelial</b> wall lining, which had never been reported before in gastric mesenchymal tumor, in addition to partial glandular structure. We reviewed our case, focusing on radiologic-pathologic correlation, and suggested hypothesis of cyst formation.

40|$|Radionuclide {{injury to}} the lung has been studied in rats, hamsters, dogs, mice and baboons. Exposure of the lung to high dose levels of {{radionuclides}} produces a spectrum of progressively more severe functional and morphological changes, ranging from radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis to lung tumors. These changes are somewhat similar for different species. Their severity {{can be related to}} the absorbed radiation dose (measured in rads) produced by alpha, beta or gamma radiation emanating from various deposited radionuclides. The chemicophysical forms of radionuclides and spatial-temporal factors are also important variables. As with other forms of {{injury to the}} lung, repair attempts are highlighted by fibrosis and proliferation of pulmonary epithelium. Lung tumors are the principal late effect observed in experimental animals following pulmonary deposition of radionuclides at dose levels that do not result in early deaths from radiation pneumonitis or fibrosis. The predominant lung <b>tumors</b> described <b>have</b> been of <b>epithelial</b> <b>origin</b> and <b>have</b> been classified, in decreasing frequency of occurrence, as adenocarcinoma, bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, epidermoid carcinomas and combined epidermoid and adenocarcinoma.

The median survival was 6. 75 years in the seven patients treated with extensive surgery (orbital exenteration, possibly associated with osseous resections) and nine years in the 12 cases treated with eye-saving procedures (tumor excision, possibly followed by radiotherapy). Our data demonstrated that extensive surgery for lacrimal gland malignancies does not improve survival. Therefore, a therapeutic protocol is suggested, in which all suspected epithelial tumors (discriminated from inflammatory and lymphoid lesions by computed tomographic scan findings) undergo dacryoadenectomy, without a previous biopsy. Subsequently, {{in the case of}} carcinomas, the choice between extensive and eye-saving procedures is based on the extent and aggressiveness of the tumor and clinical findings...|$|R
40|$|Five to ten {{per cent}} of all breast carcinomas are of {{hereditary}} origin. Many {{of them have}} been associated to mutations in the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 susceptibility genes.

40|$|Sixteen choroid plexus <b>tumors</b> (CPTs) <b>have</b> been {{investigated}} for the localization of different immunocytochemical markers of epithelial and nonepithelial nature, namely, simple epithelial-type cytokeratins, vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a panepithelial antigen {{defined by the}} lu- 5 monoclonal antibody (lu- 5 antigen), S- 100 protein, and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Intermediate filament proteins {{have been identified in}} paraffin sections of 14 of 16 cases (87. 5 %). In all these tumors, cytokeratins and vimentin were constantly coexpressed by the neoplastic cells, {{in a manner similar to}} that of the cells lining normal choroid plexus. In 7 of these 14 cases, in addition to cytokeratins and vimentin, the neoplastic cells were shown to coexpress GFAP, which is not synthesized by their normal cell counterpart. The appearance of GFAP immunoreactivity in CPTs might be related to an ependymal differentiation of the neoplastic cells, because normal ependyma and ependymomas constantly coexpress GFAP and vimentin. The simultaneous expression of three distinct intermediate filament proteins by the same neoplastic cells is an exceedingly rare phenomenon, which has never been reported by double labeling technique in neoplasms of the central nervous system. Despite the complex antigenic profile of the CPT, which includes immunoreactivity for lu- 5 antigen, S- 100 protein, and EMA in most of the cases, positivity for three different epithelial markers indicates that these <b>tumors</b> <b>have</b> an <b>epithelial</b> nature. Moreover, the immunocytochemical typing of CPT with the panel of antibodies used in the current investigation allows differentiation from other primary and metastatic central nervous system tumors...|$|R
40|$|Cnidaria is {{the sister}} group of Bilateria and thus phylogenetically {{at the base}} of the Metazoa. The {{characteristic}} trait of the phylum is the presence of nematocysts or cnidae. These unique extrusive organelles are used for prey capture, feeding, defense and partly locomotion. Cnidae or nematocysts consist of a capsule wall, a tubule with or without spines, and an opercular structure. They are produced in specialized cells (nematocytes) as secretory products in a giant post-Golgi vesicle. These stinging organelles can resist extremely high pressure and their discharge is one of the fastest mechanisms in animal kingdom. In the last decade the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (Anthozoa) became an emerging model organism alongside Hydra (Hydrozoa) for developmental and evolutionary biology. Nevertheless basic data on histology and the nematocyst repertoire (cnidom) of Nematostella vectensis are still missing. In my thesis, I characterized the Nematostella vectensis cnidom based on morphological classification. For that matter an isolation technique for intact capsules was established and the different nematocysts were analyzed using electron and light microscopy. The three capsule types (basitrichous haplonema, microbasic mastigophores and spirocysts) were quantitatively analyzed along the body axis and in the different developmental stages. Besides the morphological characterization, three molecular capsule components, minicollagen 1, 3 and 4 were isolated and in situ hybridization was performed to see their expression patterns. Antibody stainings revealed a partly abundant and partly nematocyst specific patterns of the minicollagens. The second part of the work was focused on the cellular identification of nematocysts in Nematostella vectensis. Thus, all cell types were characterized qualitatively and a cell cycle analysis was performed. Nematocytes were identified to be cuboidal epithelial cells using antibody stainings on macerates.

30|$|Carcinosarcoma is a <b>tumor</b> that <b>has</b> <b>epithelial</b> {{components}} (cancer) and non-epithelial components (sarcoma) intermingled {{into one}} lesion [18]. For the sarcomatous components in carcinosarcoma, various tissue images are generally observed {{from the one}} which indicates differentiation to bone, cartilage, muscle, or fat. Those that do not indicate clear mesenchymal differentiation are classified as “true carcinosarcomas”; these show differentiations into specific interstitial tissues in the sarcoma portion of the tumor such as rhabdomyosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and “so-called carcinosarcoma.” In these lesions, the sarcoma-like tissue is mainly composed of spindle-shaped cells but does not differentiate into the clear interstitial tissue [19]. True carcinosarcoma has three features. The first {{is the presence of}} a genuine sarcomatous component including chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma. The second {{is that there is no}} transitional zone between the carcinomatous and sarcomatous components. The third is that the sarcomatous component is positive for mesenchymal markers and negative for epithelial markers. However, it remains controversial as to whether the lesion must satisfy all the above histological features to be diagnosed as true carcinosarcoma. The tumor in this case had for a large portion of sarcomatous components that was based on spindle shape cell proliferation and cytokeratin. The tumor was positive for vimentin and was diagnosed as a so-called carcinoma. Because the epithelial components and non-epithelial components are intermingled, chemotherapy has not been successful in cases of metastasis and relapse. The development of an appropriate chemotherapy regimen is essential to improve the prognosis of carcinosarcoma.|$|R

The Dutch nation-wide pathology database PALGA (Pathologisch Anatomisch Landelijk Geautomatiseerd Archief) identified the various histopathological subtypes of ovarian cancer in 824 patients diagnosed in 1996 - 2003, and recorded the presence of epithelial tumor conditions around the ovarian tumors. In addition, a PALGA database of all 153 consecutive patients referred to the Nijmegen University Medical Centre in 2007 for histopathological work-up was analyzed. Results.

If neoplastic is it benign or malignant? If malignant what is the degree of differentiation and whether {{it is likely to}} metastasize or not? In this presentation I discuss the importance of molecular biology for the pathologist engaged in rendering histopathology services and performing research. In particular, the presentation addresses cancer and its differential diagnosis using modern immunohistochemical technology. I looked for some gene products that help in confirming a cancer, its type, degree of differentiation and whether it is expressing genes that are associated with a metastasizing potential. The other important area to be discussed is the phenomenon of Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in which the <b>tumor</b> <b>has</b> both <b>epithelial</b> as well as mesenchymal tissue even in the H&E stained routine sections.

As examples we tested esophageal squamous cell carcinomas with different degrees of differentiation and a rare carcinoma variant known as basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. We showed for the first time that the squamous and basaloid components are of different histogenesis.

For comparison, we also explored the gene expression patterns of 15 cell lines derived from lymphoid, endothelial, stromal and other epithelial cancers. Expression levels of specific genes were validated through comparison to protein expression by immunohistochemistry using cell block arrays.
