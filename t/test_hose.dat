On December 26, 1929, City Council authorized {{construction of a}} fire drill tower on a parcel of land along the Colorado River downtown, where the river could provide water for <b>testing</b> fire <b>hoses</b> and extinguishing training fires. The tower was built in 1930 {{at a cost of}} $6,200, and immediately began to be burned and flooded regularly during training exercises and the testing of equipment. It also served as a backdrop for fire department photographs, social events, and public firefighting demonstrations.|$|R
25|$|Watertight {{subdivision}} limits loss of buoyancy and freeboard in {{the event}} of damage, and may protect vital machinery from flooding. Most ships have some pumping capacity to remove accumulated water from the bilges, but a steel ship with no watertight subdivision will sink if water accumulates faster than pumps can remove it. Standards of watertight subdivision assume no dewatering capability, although pumps kept in working order may provide an additional measure of safety {{in the event}} of minor leaks. The most common watertight subdivision is accomplished with transverse bulkheads dividing the elongated hull into a number of watertight floodable lengths. Early watertight subdivision <b>tested</b> with <b>hoses</b> sometimes failed to withstand the hydrostatic pressure of an adjoining flooded compartment. Effective watertight subdivision requires these transverse bulkheads to be both watertight and structurally sound.|$|R

40|$|Hydraulic hoses {{are used}} in {{industrial}} machines to transmit power. These hoses have a physical stiffness that depends upon the hose size and type. If a computer model is used to predict the path a hose will take through a machine, accurate physical stiffness properties are required for the hose.

40|$|On this study, {{usefulness}} of new various sizes in girth of panty hoses was examined with wearing <b>test</b> of panty <b>hoses</b> (of new size and present size) and measurement of body size. The reserch about consciousness for panty hoses (for example, the price, {{the way of}} buying, and so on) was also carried out to {{women who have been}} wearing the panty hoses in daily life. The results were summarized as follows. 1. New vafious sizes in circumference of panty hoses is prefered to present size of them, and usefullness of new size is proved. 2. It is recognized that the discontent with the length of panty hoses is still remaind under the new size products. Therefore, the development of various sizes toward the length of panty hoses is desired. 3. The good fitness is precious factor for the consumer next to the price and color. 4.

40|$|While at the KSC, I {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} of assisting the Satellite Servicing Capabilities Office (SSCO) specifically the Propellant Transfer System (PTS) lead by my mentor, Brian Nufer. While waiting to test different components in the PTS, I was able to assist with <b>testing</b> for the <b>Hose</b> Management Assembly (HMA) {{and was able to}} work on a simulation in Labview. For the HMA, I was able to help with testing of a coating as well as to help test the durability of the pinch rollers in space. In Labview, I experimented with building a simulation for the PTS, to show where fluids and gases were flowing depending on which valves in the PTS were opened. Not all of the integrated parts required assembly level testing, which allowed me to test these parts individually by myself and document the results. I was also able to volunteer to assist project NEO, allowing me to gain some knowledge of cryogenic fluid systems...|$|R
5000|$|Window Installation: In the episode's first challenge, {{each team}} is {{required}} to remove the old single-pane windows from the kitchen area of their cabin, and install a double-glazed replacement. Since the new windows are larger than the ones they are replacing, each team will have to cut larger holes to fit the windows in. The installations will be tested by the experts spraying the window with a fire hose. The Pink Team prove to be by far the worst performers in this challenge, as uncertainty over how they should proceed and arguments between Danielle and Tyler see the project rapidly descend into total chaos. Matters nearly come to a head when Tyler comes dangerously close to slicing through a live electrical cable, and his carelessness and Danielle's screaming reaction causes an argument between the duo and Hillary. They take so long to cut their hole that the challenge ends before they can even attempt to install the window, and Danielle and Tyler are forced to take {{the full force of}} the fire hose through the empty hole as punishment for their failure. The Blue, Green and Purple teams all complete the job to a reasonable standard (albeit with Jake and Nicole on the Green Team continuing to argue fiercely during their project), but their windows leak due to inadequate usage of the expanding spray foam. At first sight the Red Team's window seems badly askew, but the experts are shocked to find that the window itself is actually perfectly level; the rest of their hut is in fact what's not level. The window itself holds up perfectly to the fire <b>hose</b> <b>test,</b> and so the team are named the winners of this challenge.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} {{contributes to}} the LNG supply chain {{by the development of}} a validated calculation model for corrugated flexible hoses or pipes developed for LNG Transfer. The model builds upon experience gained by TNO Technical Sciences (Fluid Dynamics) in a large number of flow tests carried out on hoses in a large range of diameters from 4 to 18 -inch. LNG transfer rates are in general relatively high as the time involved should be limited from economical point of view. In large scale offshore LNG transfer, flow rates up to 5000 m 3 /h are applied and in future flow rates up to 10. 000 m 3 /h are foreseen. Typical values mentioned for offshore operations in tandem transfer range from 50 to 150 meters hose length and hose diameter up to 20 -inch. The pressure losses in LNG offshore transfer, but also in smaller scale applications, can be considerable. The pressure loss depends on flow rate, length of the hose, internal diameter and internal hose corrugation geometry. High pressure losses will impose additional requirements on LNG pumps and might result in cavitation at the downstream end of the hose as the average pressure drops below vapor pressure. Furthermore the impact of local boiling phenomena due to heat-ingress and cavitation, possibly effected by vortex shedding along the internal corrugations, is not known. Once the gaps in the data base are filled a validated prediction model is available, which can be used in guidelines and standards. So far the EN 1474 (part 2 : Design and <b>testing</b> of transfer <b>hoses)</b> does not specify a maximum allowable pressure loss and the prescription of the requirement for the test is limited: "Flow rate testing (ambient or cryogenic) : demonstrate that the hose is capable of operating at its maximum flow rate and confirm the predicted head loss " The final goal of the project is to obtain a validated prediction model for the calculation of pressure losses in LNG transfer with flexible multi-composite and metal hoses based on input of parameters as operating conditions and hose geometry. Also input for guidelines and standards in LNG transfer with flexibles such as EN 1474 will be generated, which can be used in for qualification of LNG equipment...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} and supramolecular {{origins of}} the superior nonlinear optical (NLO) properties observed in the organic phenolic triene material, OH 1 (2 -(3 -(4 -hydroxystyryl) - 5, 5 -dimethylcyclohex- 2 -enylidene) malononitrile), are presented. The molecular charge-transfer distribution is topographically mapped, demonstrating that a uniformly delocalized passive electronic medium facilitates the charge-transfer between the phenolic electron donor and the cyano electron acceptors which lie {{at opposite ends of}} the molecule. Its ability to act as a "push-pull" pi-conjugated molecule is quantified, relative to similar materials, by supporting empirical calculations; these include bond-length alternation and harmonic-oscillator stabilization energy (<b>HOSE)</b> <b>tests.</b> Such tests, together with frontier molecular orbital considerations, reveal that OH 1 can exist readily in its aromatic (neutral) or quinoidal (charge-separated) state, thereby overcoming the "nonlinearity-thermal stability trade-off". The HOSE calculation also reveals a correlation between the quinoidal resonance contribution to the overall structure of OH 1 and the UV-vis absorption peak wavelength in the wider family of configurationally locked polyene framework materials. Solid-state tensorial coefficients of the molecular dipole, polarizability, and the first hyperpolarizability for OH 1 are derived from the first-, second-, and third-order electronic moments of the experimental charge-density distribution. The overall solid-state molecular dipole moment is compared with those from gas-phase calculations, revealing that crystal field effects are very significant in OH 1. The solid-state hyperpolarizability derived from this charge-density study affords good agreement with gas-phase calculations as well as optical measurements based on hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) and electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation. This lends support to the further use of charge-density studies to calculate solid-state hyperpolarizability coefficients in other organic NLO materials. Finally, this charge-density study is also employed to provide an advanced classification of hydrogen bonds in OH 1, which requires more stringent criteria than those from conventional structure analysis. As a result, only the strongest OH center dot center NC interaction is so classified as a true hydrogen bond. Indeed, it is this electrostatic interaction that influences the molecular charge transfer: the other four, weaker, nonbonded contacts nonetheless affect the crystal packing. Overall, the establishment of these structure?property relationships lays a blueprint for designing further, more NLO efficient, materials in this industrially leading organic family of compounds. © 2013, American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Background: High grade serous {{carcinoma}} whether ovarian, tubal or primary peritoneal, {{continues to}} be the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in the USA. Although combination chemotherapy and aggressive surgical resection has improved survival in the past decade the majority of patients still succumb to chemo-resistant disease recurrence. It has recently been reported that amplification of 5 q 31 - 5 q 35. 3 is associated with poor prognosis in patients with high grade serous ovarian carcinoma. Although the amplicon contains over 50 genes, it is notable for the presence of several members of the fibroblast growth factor signaling axis. In particular acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF 1) has been demonstrated {{to be one of the}} driving genes in mediating the observed prognostic effect of the amplicon in ovarian cancer patients. This study seeks to further validate the prognostic value of fibroblast growth receptor 4 (FGFR 4), another candidate gene of the FGF/FGFR axis located in the same amplicon. The emphasis will be delineating the role the FGF 1 /FGFR 4 signaling axis plays in high grade serous ovarian carcinoma; and test the feasibility of targeting the FGF 1 /FGFR 4 axis therapeutically. Materials and Methods: Spearman and Pearson correlation studies on data generated from array CGH and transcriptome profiling analyses on 51 microdissected tumor samples were used to identify genes located on chromosome 5 q 31 - 35. 3 that showed significant correlation between DNA and mRNA copy numbers. Significant correlation between FGF 1 and FGFR 4 DNA copy numbers was further validated by qPCR analysis on DNA isolated from 51 microdissected tumor samples. Immunolocalization and quantification of FGFR 4 expression were performed on paraffin embedded tissue samples from 183 cases of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. The expression was then correlated with clinical data to assess impact on survival. The expression of FGF 1 and FGFR 4 in vitro was quantified by real-time PCR and western blotting in six high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma cell lines and compared to those in human ovarian surface epithelial cells to identify overexpression. The effect of FGF 1 on these cell lines after serum starvation was quantified for in vitro cellular proliferation, migration/invasion, chemoresistance and survival utilizing a combination of commercially available colorimetric, fluorometric and electrical impedance assays. FGFR 4 expression was then transiently silenced via siRNA transfection and the effects on response to FGF 1, cellular proliferation, and migration were quantified. To identify relevant cellular pathways involved, responsive cell lines were transduced with different transcription response elements using the Cignal-Lenti reporter system and treated with FGF 1 with and without transient FGFR 4 knock down. This was followed by western blot confirmation for the relevant phosphoproteins. Anti-FGF 1 antibodies and FGFR trap proteins were used to attempt inhibition of FGF mediated phenotypic changes and relevant signaling in vitro. Orthotopic intraperitoneal tumors were established in nude mice using serous cell lines that have been previously transfected with luciferase expressing constructs. The mice were then treated with FGFR trap protein. Tumor progression was then followed via bioluminescent imaging. The FGFR 4 gene from 52 clinical samples was sequenced to screen for mutations. Results: FGFR 4 DNA and mRNA copy numbers were significantly correlated and FGFR 4 DNA copy number was significantly correlated with that of FGF 1. Survival of patients with high FGFR 4 expressing tumors was significantly shorter that those with low expression(median survival 28 vs 55 month p 3 ̆c 0. 001) In a multivariate cox regression model FGFR expression significantly increased risk of death (HR 2. 1, p 3 ̆c 0. 001). FGFR 4 expression was significantly higher in all cell lines <b>tested</b> compared to <b>HOSE,</b> OVCA 432 cell line in particular had very high expression suggesting amplification. FGF 1 was also particularly overexpressed in OVCA 432. FGF 1 significantly increased cell survival after serum deprivation in all cell lines. Transient knock down of FGFR 4 caused significant reduction in cell migration and proliferation in vitro and significantly decreased the proliferative effects of FGF 1 in vitro. FGFR 1, FGFR 4 traps and anti-FGF 1 antibodies did not show activity in vitro. OVCA 432 transfected with the cignal lenti reporter system revealed significant activation of MAPK, NFkB and WNT pathways, western blotting confirmed the results. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis also showed activation of MAPK, AKT, WNT pathways and down regulation of E Cadherin. FGFR trap protein significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo in an orthotopic mouse model. Conclusions: Overexpression and amplification of several members of the FGF signaling axis present on the amplicon 5 q 31 - 35. 3 is a negative prognostic indicator in high grade serous ovarian carcinoma and may drive poor survival associated with that amplicon. Activation of The FGF signaling pathway leads to downstream activation of MAPK, AKT, WNT and NFkB pathways leading to a more aggressive cancer phenotype with increased tumor growth, evasion of apoptosis and increased migration and invasion. Inhibition of FGF pathway in vivo via FGFR trap protein leads to significantly decreased tumor growth in an orthotopic mouse model...|$|R
