Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents.

No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who were free <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> border line, and {{there were no}} physical obstacles to stop their crossing it.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the year 1915, (before Zimmerwald), Nerman {{travelled}} around in the USA for several months. To finance the trip he wrote articles for several Swedish newspapers. He arrived by boat in New York City where he stayed only for a short time but took the chance <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the Woolworth Building, the highest skyscraper in the world at the time. He took the express train across the continent to San Francisco where he visited the World's Fair on opening day.|$|E

25|$|With results {{having gone}} their {{way at the}} weekend, Reading went into their Monday night game with Norwich City knowing that only a win would keep their hopes of {{automatic}} promotion alive. Shane Long inspired Reading to a 2–0 win with both goals, both of them headers from Jimmy Kebe crosses. Reading, 4th, needed to win going into a clash with Birmingham City, 2nd. Reading lost 2–1 and Birmingham went up. Reading need to win <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Premier League at the first attempt, and Sheffield United didn't win against Crystal Palace. United drew 0–0. If the Royals had won they would have gone up on Goal-Difference.|$|E
25|$|Socrates {{then returns}} to {{the myth of the}} chariot. The charioteer is filled with warmth and desire as he gazes into the eyes of the one he loves. The good horse is {{controlled}} by its sense of shame, but the bad horse, overcome with desire, does everything it can <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boy and suggest to it the pleasures of sex. The bad horse eventually wears out its charioteer and partner, and drags them towards the boy; yet when the charioteer looks into the boy's face, his memory is carried back to the sight of the forms of beauty and self-control he had with the gods, and pulls back violently on the reins. As this occurs over and over, the bad horse eventually becomes obedient and finally dies of fright when seeing the boy's face, allowing the lover's soul to follow the boy in reverence and awe.|$|E
500|$|... "The Mission" [...] {{then looks}} at how Jesus may have been viewed by the {{religious}} leaders of the time. The canonical gospels report over one hundred cases of Jesus healing or performing exorcisms, and [...] "making the unclean clean again". Jesus told lepers <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Temple Mount, where they were usually excluded, and claimed that he could forgive sins without going through the ordinary channels. Jesus met and ate with sinners, the disabled and prostitutes, and fulfilled Old Testament prophecy by riding into the Temple Mount through the Golden Gate on a donkey at Passover. Bowen concludes that all these reasons would have meant that the Pharisees of the time would have seen him as threatening.|$|E

500|$|Soon after, UMNO backbencher Mahathir bin Mohamad {{attacked}} Lee in Parliament: [...] " [...] {{have never}} known Malay rule and cannot bear {{the idea that the}} people they have so long kept under their heels should now {{be in a position to}} rule them." [...] Lee responded with an unscripted speech made entirely in Malay opposing the government's pro-Malay policies: [...] "Of course there are Chinese millionaires in big cars and big houses. Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses? ... If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, where are we going to end up? You let people in the villages believe that they are poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place [...] The moment we all start speaking Malay, he is going to have an uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what happens then? Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." ...|$|E

2500|$|On the West German side {{there were}} no {{barriers}} of any kind, nor even any patrol roads in most areas. Warning signs (Grenzschilder) with messages such as Achtung! Zonengrenze! ("Danger!

Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents. Signs in English and German provided notifications of the distance to the border to discourage accidental crossings. No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who were free <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> border line. There were no physical obstacles to stop them actually crossing it, and there were incidents of West Germans crossing the border to steal East German border markers as souvenirs (at considerable risk, since the East German border guards sought to prevent such [...] "provocations").|$|E
2500|$|Also unique are [...] "Payback is a Grandmother" [...] and [...] "A Song for Assata." [...] "Payback is a Grandmother" [...] is a {{continuation}} of the series of [...] "Stolen Moment" [...] songs that appeared on One Day It'll All Make Sense, whereby Common weaves a fictional tale in which he pursues a thief (on this occasion the thugs who have robbed his grandmother). Amidst the intricate caper, the song emphasizes the importance of family values. As Common says in the song's intro [...] "I don't know what was on y'all niggaz birds <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boat - and start robbin old folks". The song ends in a skit involving police officers at the scene of a crime where, breaking out of character, one of the officers can be heard saying [...] "the skit definitely needs more added to it... Someone get Prince Paul on the phone please" [...] - the last remark being a recognition of Prince Paul's reputation as a pioneer of the album skit.|$|E

2500|$|Noting {{that the}} words [...] "in the wilderness" [...] {{appeared}} both in [...] (where Zelophehad's daughters noted that their father Zelophehad had not taken part in Korah's rebellion) and in [...] (which {{tells the story of}} the Sabbath violator), Rabbi Akiva taught in a Baraita that Zelophehad was the man executed for gathering sticks on the Sabbath. Rabbi Judah ben Bathyra answered Akiva that Akiva would have to give an account for his accusation. For either Akiva was right that Zelophehad was the man executed for gathering sticks on the Sabbath, and Akiva revealed something that the Torah shielded from public view, or Akiva was wrong that Zelophehad was the man executed for gathering sticks on the Sabbath, and Akiva cast a stigma upon a righteous man. But the Gemara answered that Akiva learned a tradition from the Oral Torah (that went back to Sinai, and thus the Torah did not shield the matter from public view). The Gemara then asked, according to Rabbi Judah ben Bathyra, of what sin did Zelophehad die (as his daughters reported in [...] that [...] "he died in his own sin")? The Gemara reported that according to Rabbi Judah ben Bathyra, Zelophehad was among those who [...] "presumed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the mountain" [...] in [...] (to try and fail to take the Land of Israel after the incident of the spies).|$|E
