5|$|Commenting on {{the usage}} of Tantrism, The New Indian Express Kruthi Grover found {{the death of the}} sorcerer similar to the story of Bhasmasur, a demon in Indian mythology to whom Shiva gives the power to reduce a person to ashes by {{touching}} her or his head. When Bhasmasur tries to touch Shiva's head, Vishnu assumes the form of Mohini and makes Bhasmasur <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> own head, killing him. According to Malathi Rangarajan, the film's themes of Tantrism and black magic are reminiscent of the use of the occult as a plot device in films directed by B. Vittalacharya.|$|E
5|$|Ian Richardson {{was booked}} {{within a minute}} {{of the second half}} {{starting}} for bringing down Kiwomya. Notts County started to come back into the game; Martindale headed wide, Agana and Richardson both had shots blocked during a goalmouth scramble and Tony Battersby had a shot saved over the crossbar by Jonathan Gould, as County tried to equalise during a 20-minute spell of pressure. Between County's chances, Stallard had the opportunity to double City's lead when he capitalised on a slip from Strodder, but Ward saved his effort. However, City went on to double their advantage on 75 minutes. Ormondroyd, who had replaced the injured Hamilton, flicked on a long pass from Richard Huxford with his first <b>touch.</b> <b>His</b> header went across goal to Stallard who volleyed home. Two minutes after the goal, Martindale fired wide for County after a pass from Agana, and with time running out Finnan's long-range shot was deflected for a corner, but from the resulting set-piece, Richardson shot over the crossbar.|$|E

He later brings the brooch to Helen, who he realizes {{for the first time}} is blind. Hal learns she needs $3,000 for surgery that would restore her eyesight. When Helen tries to <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> face, Hal angrily storms out. He then goes to the Scott residence and demands money from Clifford and Virginia, whom he blames for his disfigurement. Clifford draws a gun and shoots Hal twice in the stomach, but the weakened Hal manages to strangle Clifford to death before escaping with Virginia's jewels. He brings them to Helen, who is concerned about Hal's injuries, but he flees before she can learn he is shot.|$|E

25|$|For a batsman the popping crease – {{which can}} be {{referred}} to as the batting crease in the context of batting – determines whether they have been stumped or run out. This is described in Laws 29, 38, and 39 of the laws of cricket. Both involve the wicket being put down before a batsman can <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> body or bat to the ground behind the popping crease and make his ground and return safely from his run. A 2010 amendment to Law 29 clarified the circumstance where the wicket is put down while a batsman has become fully airborne after having first made his ground; the batsman is regarded to not be out of his ground.|$|E

She decides to test Arjuna's love by giving him a test. At this moment, Durga, the queen of demons, chooses to possess her body and, {{controlling}} Srikandi's voice, demands to see Arjuna even though tradition forbids it. With the support of Arjuna's two other wives, Sumbadra and Larasasti, she succeeds in meeting Arjuna and tells him to provide a lock (kuncur) of Semar's hair as proof of his devotion. Arjuna reluctantly does the deed and the ceremony goes as scheduled. However, Semar is unable to accept the humiliation, stating that not even gods dare <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> head. The family does not attend Arjuna's wedding, despite being palace servants, and Semar cries at home {{for the remainder of}} the day. Meanwhile, Arjuna's brothers, including King Yudistira, leave the kingdom to meditate; Arjuna is left to rule over Amarta.|$|E

25|$|On 12 May 2002, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church canonized schema monk Amphilochius (Amfilohiy) of Pochayiv. Amphilochius of Pochayiv (in world Yakiv Holovatyuk 1894 - 1971) {{was born}} on November 27, 1894 in the village Mala Ilovytsya, in Shumsk raion of Ternopil oblast in western Ukraine. In 1925 he became a monk and joined the {{community}} of Pochayiv Lavra. In 1936, Amphilochius {{had been given the}} rank of hieromonk (priest-monk). His healing gifts attracted the attention of many people. Archimandrite of Lavra blessed the monk in this work and allowed him to settle in a little hut near the cemetery. In the summers, the pilgrimage to Amphilochius (then called father Joseph) was increasing, reaching 500 people daily. On the 11 / 12 May 2002, he was canonized by the Orthodox Church after the church commission researched his life. Just before Easter his relics were uncovered fully intact. Over 20.000 Orthodox pilgrims arrived {{to take part in the}} veneration of Saint Amphilochius. Many healings took place when people come to <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> relics.|$|E

500|$|As a {{very private}} man, Longfellow did not often add autobiographical {{elements}} to his poetry. Two notable exceptions are dedicated {{to the death of}} members of his family. [...] "Resignation" [...] was written {{as a response to the}} death of his daughter Fanny in 1848; it does not use first-person pronouns and is instead a generalized poem of mourning. The death of his second wife Frances, as biographer Charles Calhoun wrote, deeply affected Longfellow personally but [...] "seemed not to <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> poetry, at least directly". His memorial poem to her was the sonnet [...] "The Cross of Snow" [...] and was not published in his lifetime.|$|E
500|$|In October Robert Dudley {{returned}} to court, many believed, [...] "in great hope {{to marry the}} Queen". Elizabeth's affection and favour towards him was undiminished, and, importuned by unsolicited advice against a marriage with Lord Robert, she declared the inquest had shown [...] "the matter … to be contrary to which was reported" [...] and to [...] "neither <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> honesty nor her honour." [...] However, her international reputation and even her position at home were imperilled by the scandal, {{which seems to have}} convinced her that she could not risk a marriage with Dudley. Dudley himself had no illusions about his destroyed reputation, even when he first got notice of the jury's decision: [...] "God's will be done; and I wish he had made me the poorest that creepeth on the ground, so this mischance had not happened to me." [...] In September 1561, a month after the coroner's verdict was officially passed, the Earl of Arundel, one of Dudley's principal enemies, studied the testimonies in the hope of finding incriminating evidence against his rival.|$|E
500|$|Hope's playing was {{strongly}} {{based in the}} blues-influenced jazz tradition. He employed dissonant harmonies and spiky, contrasting lines and phrases. Rosenthal observed that Hope's playing {{on one of his}} compositions for the 1953 Donaldson–Brown recording illustrated [...] "many elements of the pianist's emerging style: somber, internally shifting chords in the introduction; punchy, twisting phrases in the solo; and the smoldering intensity that always characterized his best work." [...] Hope's sense of time meant that his note placement was unpredictable, falling at various points either side of the beat but not exactly on it. His use of keyboard dynamics was similarly flexible, as the listener could not predict when in a performance the level would change. The Billboard reviewer of Hope's final recordings, as reissued in 1996, wrote that [...] "he's dynamically smoother than Monk, with a spidery, spacy <b>touch.</b> <b>His</b> harmonic and compositional approach is intricate in design and almost eerie in execution." [...] Coda critic Stuart Broomer also commented on Hope's touch, suggesting that it was unusual and light, and created a combination of delicacy and boldness that was all his own. Leonard Feather and Ira Gitler summarized Hope's abilities: he had [...] "a style that parallels Powell, [...] was a pianist and composer of rare harmonic acuity and very personal interpretation." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first two}} {{volumes of the}} Japanese edition were {{described}} by Anime News Network (ANN) as [...] "quietly brilliant" [...] and [...] "the slice-of-life genre at its best", saying that despite some [...] "storytelling goofs", there is [...] "no matching the pleasant feelings that come from reading this series." [...] The French edition was praised by Manga News as a [...] "great success" [...] and [...] "a pure delight as usual," [...] citing as key ingredients the [...] "appealing and funny characters" [...] put in funny situations, accessible drawing style, and Adachi's talent for staging baseball scenes; Adachi was praised {{for his ability to}} mix [...] "the sports world which he cherishes so much and the love relationships that are not yet real but so much implied and awaited" [...] and his skill at rendering moving scenes without dialogue. The reviewer noted that while Adachi's art style has not changed much since <b>Touch,</b> <b>his</b> layouts are cleaner and his action scenes more dynamic than before. Anime Land praised Adachi for his [...] "sense of the elliptical and staging", the verisimilitude of his stories, appealing secondary characters, and ability to develop comedy in just one panel. The reviewer claimed Adachi's handling of Wakaba's death is [...] "remarkable" [...] and that the event [...] "gave real meaning" [...] to the story.|$|E
500|$|By May 1941, Sinatra {{topped the}} male singer polls in Billboard and Down Beat magazines. His appeal to bobby soxers, as teenage girls {{of that time}} were called, {{revealed}} a whole new audience for popular music, which had been recorded mainly for adults up to that time. The phenomenon became officially known as [...] "Sinatramania" [...] after his [...] "legendary opening" [...] at the Paramount Theatre in New York on December 30, 1942. According to Nancy Sinatra, Jack Benny later said, [...] "I thought the goddamned building was going to cave in. I never heard such a commotion... All this for a fellow I never heard of." [...] Sinatra performed for four weeks at the theatre, his act following the Benny Goodman orchestra, after which his contract was renewed for another four weeks by Bob Weitman due to his popularity. He became known as [...] "Swoonatra" [...] or [...] "The Voice", and his fans [...] "Sinatratics". They organized meetings and sent masses of letters of adoration, {{and within a few}} weeks of the show, some 1000 Sinatra fan clubs had been reported across the US. Sinatra's publicist, George Evans, encouraged interviews and photographs with fans, and was the man responsible for depicting Sinatra as a vulnerable, shy, Italian–American with a rough childhood who made good. When Sinatra returned to the Paramount in October 1944 only 250 persons left the first show, and 35,000 fans left outside caused a near riot, known as the Columbus Day Riot, outside the venue because they were not allowed in. [...] Such was the bobby-soxer devotion to Sinatra that they were known to write Sinatra's song titles on their clothing, bribe hotel maids for an opportunity to <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> bed, and accost his person in the form of stealing clothing he was wearing, most commonly his bow-tie.|$|E
