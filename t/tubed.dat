5|$|The {{technique}} of building lightweight domes with interlocking hollow ceramic tubes further developed in North Africa and Italy {{in the late}} 3rd and early 4th centuries. By the 4th century, the thin and lightweight <b>tubed</b> vaulting had become a vaulting technique in its own right, rather than simply serving as a permanent centering for concrete. It was used in early Christian buildings in Italy. Arranging these terracotta tubes in a continuous spiral created a dome that was not strong enough for very large spans, but required only minimal centering and formwork. The later dome of the Baptistry of Neon in Ravenna is an example.|$|E

His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery. When tripped, a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head. His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank, a catch device, a pivot on a projection, a sling suspending the pendulum, an attachment for the sling, and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum. Wang Zhenduo (王振鐸) argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.|$|E

40|$|Responses of [beta]-tubulin gene {{expression}} to low-temperature exposure (4 [deg]C) {{have been investigated}} in leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana. During low-temperature exposure, the patterns of both [alpha]- and [beta]-tubulin isoforms are altered; the effect is smaller for the [alpha]-tubulins than for the [beta]-tubulins, however. An examination of [beta]-tubulin {{gene expression}} revealed that during low-temperature exposure, transcript levels of <b>TUB</b> 2, <b>TUB</b> 3, <b>TUB</b> 6, and <b>TUB</b> 8 decrease, whereas those of <b>TUB</b> 4, <b>TUB</b> 5, and <b>TUB</b> 7 remain constant, and the <b>TUB</b> 9 transcript level increases. The changes in transcript levels of <b>TUB</b> 6, <b>TUB</b> 8, and <b>TUB</b> 9 were detectable after 6 h of low-temperature treatment. As shown by transcription-blocking experiments, the in vivo decay rates at 25 [deg]C are comparable to those at 4 [deg]C for <b>TUB</b> 5, <b>TUB</b> 6, and <b>TUB</b> 8 mRNAs, whereas <b>TUB</b> 9 mRNA {{appears to be more}} stable at 4 [deg]C than at 25 [deg]C. Thus, decreases in transcript levels of <b>TUB</b> 6 and <b>TUB</b> 8 in response to low temperature appear to be regulated at the transcriptional level, and the increase in <b>TUB</b> 9 transcript level that results from lowering the temperature from 25 [deg]C to 4 [deg]C may be due in part to its slower rate of decay at 4 [deg]C. When a chimeric gene containing 1061 base pairs of <b>TUB</b> 8 5 [prime] flanking DNA fused to the [beta]-glucuronidase coding region was used to produce transgenic Arabidopsis plants, the chimeric gene expression was down-regulated in response to low temperature as assayed by histochemical localization and RNA gel blots.

2500|$|The tube ride is {{considered}} to be the ultimate maneuver in surfing.

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Mutations in the Tubby gene (<b>TUB)</b> cause late-onset {{obesity and}} insulin {{resistance}} in mice and syndromic obesity in humans. Although <b>TUB</b> gene function {{has not yet}} been fully elucidated, studies in rodents indicate that <b>TUB</b> is involved in the hypothalamic pathways regulating food intake and adiposity. Aside from the function in central nervous system, <b>TUB</b> has also been implicated in energy metabolism in adipose tissue in rodents. We aimed to determine the expression and distribution patterns of <b>TUB</b> in man as well as its potential association with obesity. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In situ hybridization was used to localize the hypothalamic regions and cells expressing <b>TUB</b> mRNA. Using RT-PCR, we determined the mRNA expression level of the two <b>TUB</b> gene alternative splicing isoforms, the short and the long transcript variants, in the hypothalami of 12 obese and 12 normal-weight subjects, and in biopsies from visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissues from 53 severely obese and 24 non-obese control subjects, and correlated <b>TUB</b> expression with parameters of obesity and metabolic health. RESULTS: Expression of both <b>TUB</b> transcripts was detected in the hypothalamus, while only the short <b>TUB</b> isoform was found in both VAT and SAT. <b>TUB</b> mRNA was detected in several hypothalamic regions involved in body weight regulation, including the nucleus basalis of Meynert and the paraventricular, supraoptic and tuberomammillary nuclei. We found no difference in the hypothalamic <b>TUB</b> expression between obese and control groups, while the level of <b>TUB</b> mRNA was significantly lower in adipose tissue of obese subjects as compared to controls. Also, <b>TUB</b> expression was negatively correlated with indices of body weight and obesity in a fat-depot-specific manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate high expression of <b>TUB</b> in the hypothalamus, especially in areas involved in body weight regulation, and the correlation between <b>TUB</b> expression in adipose tissue and obesity.
