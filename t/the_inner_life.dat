25|$|As {{part of her}} {{original}} patent, Teresa was given permission to set up two houses for men who wished to adopt the reforms; she convinced John of the Cross and Anthony of Jesus to help with this. They founded the first convent of Discalced Carmelite Brethren in November 1568 at Duruello. Another friend, Jerónimo Gracián, Carmelite visitator of the older observance of Andalusia and apostolic commissioner, and later provincial of the Teresian reforms, gave her powerful support in founding convents at Segovia (1571), Beas de Segura (1574), Seville (1575), and Caravaca de la Cruz (Murcia, 1576), while the deeply mystical John, by his power as teacher and preacher, promoted <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>life</b> of the movement.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time Schleiermacher {{prepared}} his chief theological work Der christliche Glaube nach den Grundsätzen der evangelischen Kirche (1821–1822; 2nd ed., greatly altered, 1830–1831; 6th ed., 1884). The fundamental principle is that religious feeling, the sense of absolute dependence on God as communicated by Jesus through the church, and not the creeds or the letter of Scripture or the rationalistic understanding, is the source and basis of dogmatic theology. The work is therefore simply {{a description of the}} facts of religious feeling, or of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>life</b> of the soul in its relations to God, and these inward facts are looked at in the various stages of their development and presented in their systematic connection. The aim of the work was to reform Protestant theology, {{to put an end to}} the unreason and superficiality of both supernaturalism and rationalism, and to deliver religion and theology from dependence on perpetually changing systems of philosophy.|$|E

500|$|Disraeli's early [...] "silver fork" [...] novels Vivian Grey (1826) and The Young Duke (1831) {{featured}} romanticised {{depictions of}} aristocratic life (despite his ignorance of it) with character sketches of well-known public figures lightly disguised. [...] In {{some of his}} early fiction Disraeli also portrayed himself and what he felt to be his Byronic dual nature: the poet and the man of action. His most autobiographical novel was Contarini Fleming (1832), an avowedly serious work that did not sell well. The critic William Kuhn suggests that Disraeli's fiction {{can be read as}} [...] "the memoirs he never wrote", revealing <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>life</b> of a politician for whom the norms of Victorian public life appeared to represent a social straitjacket—particularly with regard to what Kuhn sees as the author's [...] "ambiguous sexuality".|$|E
500|$|In {{the latter}} essay, Long insisted {{that there was}} a {{difference}} between the study of nature and the study of science; whereas science concerned itself with laws and generalizations, the study of nature was far more complex as it allowed for the recognition of individual life forms. He wrote, [...] "The difference between Nature and Science is the difference between a man who loves animals, and so understands them, and the man who studies Zoology; it is the difference between the woman who cherishes her old-fashioned flower-garden and the professor who lectures on Botany in a college class-room." [...] Long's intention was to divide the old school naturalists (which included Burroughs among its members) from what he saw as the newly formed school, of which he was part, whose members were capable of seeing animals as individuals. Because he wrote personal nature essays, and not scientific reports, Long believed that his readers required from him [...] "not simply eyes and ears and a note-book; but insight, imagination, and, above all, an intense human sympathy, by which alone <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>life</b> of an animal becomes luminous, and without which the living creatures are little better than stuffed specimens".|$|E
500|$|According to Fedor Kondratev, {{an expert}} of the Serbsky Center and {{supporter}} of Snezhnevsky {{and his colleagues}} who developed the concept of sluggish schizophrenia in the 1960s, those arrested by the KGB under RSFSR Criminal Code Article 70 ("anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda"), 190-1 ("dissemination of knowingly false fabrications that defame the Soviet state and social system") made up, in those years, the main group targeted by the period of using psychiatry for political purposes. It was they who began to be searched for [...] "psychopathological mechanisms" [...] and, therefore, mental illness which gave the grounds to recognize an accused person as mentally incompetent, to debar him from appearance and defence in court, and then to send him for compulsory treatment to a special psychiatric hospital of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The trouble (not guilt) of Soviet psychiatric science was its theoretical overideologization {{as a result of}} the strict demand to severely preclude any deviations from the [...] "exclusively scientific" [...] concept of Marxism–Leninism. This showed, in particular, in the fact that Soviet psychiatry under the totalitarian regime considered that penetrating <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>life</b> of an ill person was flawed psychologization, existentionalization. In this connection, one did not admit the possibility that an individual can behave [...] "in a different way than others do" [...] not only because of his mental illness but on the ground alone of his moral sets consistently with his conscience. It entailed the consequence: if a person different from all others opposes the political system, one needs to search for [...] "psychopathological mechanisms" [...] of his dissent. Even in cases when catamnesis confirmed the correctness of a diagnosis of schizophrenia, it did not always mean that mental disorders were the cause of dissent and, all the more, that one needed to administer compulsory treatment [...] "for it" [...] in special psychiatric hospitals. What seems essential is another fact that the mentally ill could oppose the totalitarianism as well, by no means due to their [...] "psychopathological mechanisms", but as persons who, despite having the diagnosis of schizophrenia, retained moral civic landmarks. Any ill person with schizophrenia could be a dissident if his conscience could not keep silent, Kondratev says.|$|E
