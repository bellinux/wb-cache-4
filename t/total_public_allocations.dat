30|$|The {{rest of the}} {{analysis}} is structured as follows. Section  2 discusses the theoretical impact of the Internet on the share of resource revenue to <b>total</b> <b>public</b> revenue. Section  3 presents the model specification that allows examining empirically {{the impact of the}} Internet on the share of resource revenue to <b>total</b> <b>public</b> revenue. Section  4 discusses the empirical strategy. Section  5 interprets the estimations’ results. Section  6 deepens {{the analysis}}, while Sect.  7 concludes.|$|R
30|$|Turning {{specifically}} to results in Table  2, we obtain from column (1) of this table that the coefficient {{associated with the}} variable INTERNET is not statistically significant at the 10 % level, whereas in column (2) which includes the variable “DUMRES”, we obtain a negative and significant effect (at the 1 % level) of the Internet usage intensity on the share of resource revenue in <b>total</b> <b>public</b> revenue. This clearly suggests that the Internet facilitates the shift from reliance on resource revenue to an increasing dependence on non-resource revenue in the overall public revenue. In particular, we note that a 1 -percentage point increase in the Internet usage intensity {{is associated with a}} 0.056 -percentage point decline in the share of resource revenue in <b>total</b> <b>public</b> revenue for countries contained in the sub-sample of “ResCountries”. In the light of these findings, our baseline model would henceforth be the one that contains the dummy variable “DUMRES” along with its interaction with the “INTERNET” variable. Moving on to results related to control variables in column (2) of Table  2, we observe that trade policy liberalization and the population size exert no significant effect on the share of resource revenue in <b>total</b> <b>public</b> revenue. Higher oil prices, lower inflation rate and lower institutional and governance quality induce a rise in the share of resource revenue in <b>total</b> <b>public</b> revenue. As expected, countries with higher real per capita income (higher development level) tend to mobilize higher share of resource revenue in <b>total</b> <b>public</b> revenue compared to less developed countries: this is exemplified by the positive and statistically significant coefficient of the variable capturing the real per capita income. The coefficient associated with the “Trend” variable is negative and statistically significant, therefore suggesting a decline in the share of resource revenue in <b>total</b> <b>public</b> revenue over time.|$|R
