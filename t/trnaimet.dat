40|$|The yeast {{retrotransposon}} Ty 1 transposes {{through an}} RNA intermediate by a mechanism {{similar to that}} of retroviral reverse transcription and integration. Ty 1 RNA contains a putative minus strand primer binding site (-PBS) that is complementary to the 3 ' acceptor stem of the initiator methionine tRNA (<b>tRNA(iMet)).</b> Here we demonstrate that the <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> is used as a primer for Ty 1 reverse transcription. Mutations in the Ty 1 element that alter 5 of 10 nucleotides that are complementary to the <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> abolish Ty 1 transposition, even though they are silent with regard to Ty 1 protein coding. We have constructed a yeast strain lacking wild-type <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> that is dependent on a mutant derivative of <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> that has an altered acceptor stem sequence, engineered to restore homology with the Ty 1 -PBS mutant. The compensatory mutations made in the <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> alleviate the transposition defect of the Ty 1 -PBS mutant. The mutant and wild-type <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> are enriched within Ty 1 virus-like particles irrespective of complementarity to the Ty 1 -PBS. Thus, complementarity between the Ty 1 -PBS and <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> is essential for transposition but is not necessary for packaging of the tRNA inside virus-like particles...|$|E
40|$|Control of {{cellular}} tRNA repertoires can drive specific programmes of translation to favour {{the maintenance of}} proliferative or differentiated phenotypes. <b>tRNAiMet</b> is the initiator methionine tRNA, responsible for recognising the start codon and initiating translation. We have investigated how increased expression of <b>tRNAiMet</b> can influence cell behaviour, using both immortalised cell lines in vitro and mouse models in vivo. Levels of <b>tRNAiMet</b> are increased in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts compared to normal fibroblasts. To understand the cellular effects of <b>tRNAiMet</b> overexpression in more detail we generated immortalised mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs) that overexpressed <b>tRNAiMet</b> (iMEF. <b>tRNAiMet)</b> or an empty vector as control (iMEF. Vector). Full characterisation of iMEF. Vector and iMEF. <b>tRNAiMet</b> cell lines showed that overexpression of <b>tRNAiMet</b> did not affect cell size, energy metabolism, cell spreading, rate {{of cellular}} protein synthesis or proliferation. Increased expression of <b>tRNAiMet</b> did, however, have marked effects on cell migration; with iMEF. <b>tRNAiMet</b> cells migrating approximately 1. 5 fold faster than iMEF. Vector controls when assessing both directional and random migration. This tRNAiMet-driven increase in cell speed was dependent on the levels of phosphorylated eIF 2 α, indicating that fibroblast migration might be influenced by <b>tRNAiMet</b> in the ternary complex. Furthermore, the ability of <b>tRNAiMet</b> to increase cell migration depended {{on the ability of}} integrin α 5 β 1 to bind its extracellular ligand fibronectin. However, despite the robust and reproducible role of both phospho-eIF 2 α and integrin α 5 β 1 in this process, the way in which these are mechanistically linked to <b>tRNAiMet</b> levels is yet to be determined. To investigate whether increased stromal <b>tRNAiMet</b> expression may contribute to tumour progression, we utilised a mouse that expressed additional copies of the <b>tRNAiMet</b> gene (2 +tRNAiMet mouse), and performed syngeneic allografts into these animals. Subcutaneous allograft tumours of a number of different cancer cell lines became more vascularised and grew significantly more rapidly in 2 +tRNAiMet mice by comparison with tumours grown in littermate control animals. The extracellular matrix (ECM) that was deposited by fibroblasts from 2 +tRNAiMet mice was found to support enhanced endothelial cell and fibroblast migration. We used SILAC mass spectrometry to compare the secretome of iMEF. Vector and iMEF. <b>tRNAiMet</b> cell lines and found that overexpression of <b>tRNAiMet</b> significantly increased synthesis and secretion of certain types of collagen, in particular collagen II. Moreover, knockdown of collagen II using siRNA and CRISPR approaches opposed the ability of <b>tRNAiMet</b> overexpressing fibroblasts to deposit a pro-migratory ECM. We used the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, ethyl- 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoate (DHB), to determine whether collagen synthesis contributed to the ability of <b>tRNAiMet</b> to drive a pro-tumorigenic stroma in vivo. Administration of DHB had no effect on the growth of syngeneic allografts in wild-type mice, but opposed the ability of 2 +tRNAiMet animals to support increased angiogenesis and tumour growth. Collectively these data indicate that increased expression of <b>tRNAiMet</b> contributes to tumour progression by enhancing the ability of stromal fibroblasts to synthesise and secrete a collagen II-rich ECM that supports endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. Taken together these data provide evidence that the tRNAome, and in particular cellular levels of <b>tRNAiMet,</b> influence both the migration of fibroblasts and the composition of their secretome in a way that promotes the generation of a microenvironment supportive of endothelial cell migration, angiogenesis and tumour growth...|$|E
40|$|Two nonallelic human <b>tRNAiMet</b> genes were {{assigned}} to chromosome 6 by filter hybridization of DNA from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids by using probes containing unique sequences from the regions flanking each <b>tRNAiMet</b> gene. These unique sequence probes thus allowed each <b>tRNAiMet</b> gene to be analyzed individually in cell hybrids. Both <b>tRNAiMet</b> genes segregated in the hybrid cells with the chromosome 6 enzyme markers, soluble malic enzyme and the mitochondrial form of superoxide dismutase, and also with a karyotypically normal chromosome 6. By using hybrid clones containing translocations that divide chromosome 6 into five segments, both <b>tRNAiMet</b> genes {{were assigned}} to the p 23 leads to q 12 region. These results raise the possibility that other <b>tRNAiMet</b> genes may be syntenic with the two described in this study and illustrate the utility of using unique flanking sequences to identify members of a multigene family...|$|E

The 10 -nucleotide PBS is complementary {{to the last}} 10 nucleotides of the acceptor stem of <b>tRNA(iMet).</b> A structural probing study of the interactions between the Ty 1 RNA template and the <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> primer showed that besides interactions between the PBS and the 3 ' end of <b>tRNA(iMet),</b> three short regions of Ty 1 RNA, named boxes 0, 1, and 2. 1, interact with the T and D stems and loops of <b>tRNA(iMet).</b> To determine if these sequences are important for the reverse transcription pathway of the Ty 1 retrotransposon, mutant Ty 1 elements and <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> were {{tested for the ability}} to support transposition. We show that the Ty 1 boxes and the complementary sequences in the T and D stems and loops of <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> contain bases that are critical for Ty 1 retrotransposition. Disruption of 1 or 2 bp between <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> and box 0, 1, or 2. 1 dramatically decreases the level of transposition. Compensatory mutations which restore base pairing between the primer and the template restore transposition. Analysis of the reverse transcription intermediates generated inside Ty 1 virus-like particles indicates that initiation of minus-strand strong-stop DNA synthesis is affected by mutations disrupting complementarity between Ty 1 RNA and primer <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Reverse {{transcription}} of {{the yeast}} retrotransposon Ty 1 is primed by the cytoplasmic initiator methionine tRNA (<b>tRNA(iMet)).</b> The primer <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> is packaged inside virus-like particles (VLPs) and binds to a 10 nucleotides minus-strand primer binding site, the (-) PBS, complementary to its 3 ' acceptor stem. We {{have found that}} three short sequences of the Ty 1 RNA (box 1, box 2. 1 and box 2. 2) located 3 ' to the (-) PBS are complementary to {{other regions of the}} primer <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> (T psi C and DHU stems and loops). Reconstitution of reverse transcription in vitro with T 7 transcribed Ty 1 RNA species and <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> purified from yeast cells shows that the boxes do not affect the efficiency of reverse transcription. Thus the role of the boxes on packaging of the primer <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> into the VLPs was investigated by analysing the level of <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> packaged into mutant VLPs. Specific nucleotide changes in the (-) PBS or in the boxes that do not change the protein coding sequence but disrupt the complementarity with the primer <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> within the VLPs. We propose that base pairing between the primer <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> and the Ty 1 RNA is of major importance for <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> packaging into the VLPs. Moreover the intactness of the boxes is essential for retrotransposition as shown by the transposition defect of a Ty 1 element harboring an intact (-) PBS and mutated boxes...|$|E
40|$|The role of 2 '-ribosylated {{adenosine}} 64 in <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> from yeast in initiation/elongation discrimination was investigated. As {{measured by}} {{in vitro translation}} in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, the specific removal of the 2 '-ribosylphosphate at adenosine 64 via periodate oxidation allows <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> to read internal AUG codons of the globine messenger RNA. Yeast Met-tRNA(iMet) lacking the modification of nucleoside 64 forms ternary complexes with GTP and elongation factor Tu from Escherichia coli. The lack of modification at position 64 does not prevent <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> from participating in the initiation process of in vitro protein synthesis. Wheat germ <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> has a 2 '-ribosylated guanosine at position 64. Removal of this modification from the wheat germ <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> enables it to read internal AUG codons of globine and tobacco mosaic virus messenger RNA in reticulocyte and wheat germ translation systems, respectively...|$|E

To understand the molecular {{basis of the}} <b>tRNAi(Met)</b> -Ty 1 RNA interaction the secondary structure of the binary complex was analysed. Enzymatic probes were {{used to test the}} conformation of <b>tRNAi(Met)</b> and of Ty 1 RNA in the free form and in the complex. A secondary structure model of the <b>tRNAi(Met)</b> Ty 1 RNA complex consistent with the probing data was constructed {{with the help of a}} computer program. The model shows that besides interactions between the primer binding site and the last 10 nt at the 3 '-end of <b>tRNAi(Met),</b> three short regions of Ty 1 RNA named boxes 0, 1 and 2. 1 interact with the T and D stems and loops of <b>tRNAiMet.</b> Mutations were made in the boxes or in the complementary sequences of <b>tRNAi(Met)</b> to study the contribution of these sequences to formation of the complex. We find that interaction with at least one of the two boxes 0 or 1 is absolutely required for efficient annealing of the two RNAs. Sequence comparison showing that the primary sequence of the boxes is strictly conserved in Ty 1 and Ty 2 elements and previously published in vivo results underline the functional importance of the primary sequence of the boxes and suggest that extended interactions between genomic Ty 1 RNA and the primary <b>tRNAi(Met)</b> play a role in the reverse transcription pathway...|$|E

Despite this fact, it is {{not currently}} known how <b>tRNAiMet</b> expression levels influence tumor progression. We have found that <b>tRNAiMet</b> expression is increased in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts, implicating deregulated expression of <b>tRNAiMet</b> in the tumor stroma as a possible contributor to tumor progression. To investigate how elevated stromal <b>tRNAiMet</b> contributes to tumor progression, we generated a mouse expressing additional copies of the <b>tRNAiMet</b> gene (2 +tRNAiMet mouse). Growth and vascularization of subcutaneous tumor allografts was enhanced in 2 +tRNAiMet mice compared with wild-type littermate controls. Extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited by fibroblasts from 2 +tRNAiMet mice supported enhanced endothelial cell and fibroblast migration. SILAC mass spectrometry indicated that elevated expression of <b>tRNAiMet</b> significantly increased synthesis and secretion of certain types of collagen, in particular type II collagen. Suppression of type II collagen opposed the ability of tRNAiMet-overexpressing fibroblasts to deposit pro-migratory ECM. We used the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor ethyl- 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoate (DHB) to determine whether collagen synthesis contributes to the tRNAiMet-driven pro-tumorigenic stroma in vivo. DHB had no effect on the growth of syngeneic allografts in wild-type mice but opposed the ability of 2 +tRNAiMet mice to support increased angiogenesis and tumor growth. Finally, collagen II expression predicts poor prognosis in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma.

40|$|Stress {{response}} {{mechanisms that}} modulate {{the dynamics of}} tRNA degradation and accumulation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus have been studied in yeast, the rat hepatoma and human cells. In the current study, we investigated tRNA degradation and accumulation in HeLa cells under various forms of stress. We found that initiator tRNAMet (<b>tRNA(iMet))</b> was specifically degraded under heat stress. Two exonucleases, Xrn 1 and Xrn 2, {{are involved in the}} degradation of <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, respectively. In addition to degradation, we observed accumulation of <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> in the nucleus. We also found that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which regulates tRNA trafficking in yeast, is partially phosphorylated at Ser 2448 in the presence of rapamycin and/or during heat stress.

To function as primer for this reverse transcription, the Drosophila <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> must be cleaved in vivo at the site between nucleotides 39 and 40. When a synthetic Drosophila <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> precursor was incubated with M 1 RNA, the catalytic RNA of Escherichia coli RNase P, other cleavages within the mature tRNA sequence were detected {{in addition to the}} efficient removal of the 5 ' leader sequence of this tRNA precursor.

40|$|The tRNA m 1 A 58 methyltransferase is {{composed}} of two subunits encoded by the essential genes TRM 6 and TRM 61 (formerly GCD 10 and GCD 14). The trm 6 - 504 mutation results in a defective m 1 A methyltransferase (Mtase) and a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype that is attributable {{to the absence of}} m 1 A 58 and consequential <b>tRNAiMet</b> instability. We used a genetic approach to identify the genes responsible for <b>tRNAiMet</b> degradation in trm 6 cells. Three recessive extragenic mutations that suppress trm 6 - 504 mutant phenotypes and restore hypomodified <b>tRNAiMet</b> to near normal levels were identified. The wild-type allele of one suppressor, DIS 3 /RRP 44, encodes a 3 ′- 5 ′ exoribonuclease {{and a member of the}} multisubunit exosome complex. We provide evidence that a functional nuclear exosome is required for the degradation of <b>tRNAiMet</b> lacking m 1 A 58. A second suppressor gene encodes Trf 4 p, a DNA polymerase (pol σ) with poly(A) polymerase activity. Whereas deletion of TRF 4 leads to stabilization of <b>tRNAiMet,</b> overexpression of Trf 4 p destabilizes the hypomodified <b>tRNAiMet</b> in trm 6 cells. The hypomodified, but not wild-type, pre-tRNAiMet accumulates as a polyadenylated species, whose abundance and length distribution both increase upon Trf 4 p overexpression.

Here we show that increased <b>tRNAiMet</b> within cancer cells does not influence tumour growth, but drives cell migration and invasion via a mechanism that is independent from ECM synthesis and dependent on α 5 β 1 integrin and levels of the translation initiation ternary complex. In vivo and ex vivo migration (but not proliferation) of melanoblasts is significantly enhanced in transgenic mice which express additional copies of the <b>tRNAiMet</b> gene. We show that increased <b>tRNAiMet</b> in melanoma drives migratory, invasive behaviour and metastatic potential without affecting cell proliferation and primary tumour growth, and that expression of RNA polymerase III-associated genes (which drive tRNA expression) are elevated in metastases by comparison with primary tumours.

Since the domain of the template RNA encodes a portion of protein TyA, we have calculated its amino acid profile and its nucleotide profile to evaluate the role played by nucleotide sequence conservation in the selection for TyA function and in the maintenance of base pairing interactions for the priming function of Ty 1 RNA. Our results show that the nucleotide sequence conservation of Ty 1 RNA is constrained not only by selection for Ty 1 function but also by maintenance of a given nucleotide sequence able to base pair with the <b>tRNAiMet</b> in the primer-template initiation complex...|$|E

Here we show that protein kinase C α (PKCα) interacts with TRM 61, the catalytic subunit of the TRM 6 / 61 tRNA methyltransferase. The TRM 6 / 61 complex is known to methylate the adenosine 58 of the initiator methionine tRNA (<b>tRNAiMet),</b> a nuclear post-transcriptional modification associated with the stabilization of this crucial component of the translation-initiation process. Depletion of TRM 6 / 61 reduced proliferation and increased death of C 6 glioma cells, effects that can be partially rescued by overexpression of <b>tRNAiMet.</b> In contrast, elevated TRM 6 / 61 expression regulated the translation of a subset of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in the tumorigenic process and increased the ability of C 6 cells to form colonies in soft agar or spheres when grown in suspension. In TRM 6 / 61 /tRNAiMet-overexpressing cells, PKCα overexpression decreased <b>tRNAiMet</b> expression and both colony- and sphere-forming potentials. A concomitant increase in TRM 6 /TRM 61 mRNA and <b>tRNAiMet</b> expression with decreased expression of PKCα mRNA was detected in highly aggressive glioblastoma multiforme as compared with Grade II/III glioblastomas, highlighting the clinical relevance of our findings. Altogether, we suggest that PKCα tightly controls TRM 6 / 61 activity to prevent translation deregulation that would favor neoplastic development...|$|E
40|$|The conserved {{positions}} of the eukaryotic cytoplasmic initiator tRNA have been suggested to be important for the initiation of protein synthesis. However, the role of these positions is not known. We describe in this report a functional analysis of the yeast initiator methionine tRNA (<b>tRNA(iMet)),</b> using a novel in vivo assay system which is not dependent on suppressor tRNAs. Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with null alleles of the four initiator methionine tRNA (IMT) genes were constructed. Consequently, growth of these strains was dependent on <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> encoded from a plasmid-derived gene. We used these strains to investigate {{the significance of the}} conserved nucleosides of yeast <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> in vivo. Nucleotide substitutions corresponding to the nucleosides of the yeast elongator methionine tRNA (tRNA(MMet)) have been made at all conserved positions to identify the positions that are important for <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> to function in the initiation process. Surprisingly, nucleoside changes in base pairs 3 - 70, 12 - 23, 31 - 39, and 29 - 41, as well as expanding loop I by inserting an A at position 17 (A 17) had no effect on the tester strain. Nucleotide substitutions in positions 54 and 60 to cytidines and guanosines (C 54, G 54, C 60, and G 60) did not prevent cell growth. In contrast, the double mutation U/rT 54 C 60 blocked cell growth, and changing the A-U base pair 1 - 72 to a G-C base pair was deleterious to the cell, although these tRNAs were synthesized and accepted methionine in vitro. From our data, we suggest that an A-U base pair in position 1 - 72 is important for <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> function, that the hypothetical requirement for adenosines at positions 54 and 60 is invalid, and that a U/rT at position 54 is an antideterminant distinguishing an elongator from an initiator tRNA in the initiation of translation...|$|E

Purified Flag-tagged Gcd 14 p alone had no enzymatic activity and was severely impaired for tRNA-binding compared with the wild-type complex, suggesting that Gcd 10 p is required for tight binding of the tRNA substrate. Our results provide a demonstration of a two-component tRNA MTase and suggest that binding of AdoMet and tRNA substrates depends on different subunits of the complex...|$|E
40|$|Retroviruses, {{including}} HIV- 1 and the distantly related yeast retroelement Ty 3, all encode a nucleoprotein {{required for}} virion structure and replication. During an in vitro comparison of HIV- 1 and Ty 3 nucleoprotein function in RNA dimerization and cDNA synthesis, we discovered a bipartite primer-binding site (PBS) for Ty 3 composed of sequences located {{at opposite ends}} of the genome. Ty 3 cDNA synthesis requires the 3 ' PBS for primer <b>tRNAiMet</b> annealing to the genomic RNA, and the 5 ' PBS, in cis or in trans, as the reverse transcription start site. Ty 3 RNA alone is unable to dimerize, but formation of dimeric <b>tRNAiMet</b> bound to the PBS was found to direct dimerization of Ty 3 RNA-tRNAiMet. Interestingly, HIV- 1 nucleocapsid protein NCp 7 and Ty 3 NCp 9 were interchangeable using HIV- 1 and Ty 3 RNA template-primer systems. Our findings impact on the understanding of non-canonical reverse transcription {{as well as on the}} use of Ty 3 systems to screen for anti-NCp 7 drugs...|$|E
40|$|Translation is a {{multi-stage}} process comprising initiation, elongation and termination. It {{has been}} suggested that the initiation phase is the rate limiting step of this process. In this thesis the contributions of how changes in initiation and elongation rates lead to overall alterations in gene expression pathways were investigated {{in a number of different}} systems. It has been shown previously that increased expression of <b>tRNAiMet</b> is associated with tumourigenesis however the precise role of <b>tRNAiMet</b> in this process was unclear. Data obtained from cells with increased <b>tRNAiMet</b> copy number show that the associated increase in proliferation is transient and unlikely to play a major role in cancer. In collaboration with Dr Owen Samson’s group, it was shown that early dysplastic changes in intestinal tumourigenesis are driven by increased translation elongation via mammalian target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC 1). It was found that constitutively active mutant K-Ras confers resistance to mTORC 1 inhibition, and combined mTORC 1 / 2 inhibition but that these tumours are acutely sensitivity to loss of the mTORC 2 component, Rictor. Interestingly, changes in translation elongation rate were also identified in cells cooled to 32 oC and this was associated with the reprogramming of gene expression under these conditions. Finally, the use of the next-generation sequencing technique ribosome profiling illustrated some potential challenges of using this approach to infer biologically relevant conclusions. These include: biases in fragment and library generation, limited read depth and statistical inference from low-count data. An alternate library generation method reduced bias, but reads predicted to be highly structured were still over-represented. The use of a newly developed thermostable ligase did not remedy this problem, but this may be due to additional biases associated with the particular ligase used.

40|$|A {{combination}} of hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose and reversed phase HPLC {{was used to}} purify individual tRNAs with high specific activity. The efficiency of chromatographic separation was enhanced by biochemical manipulations of the tRNA molecule, such as aminoacylation, formylation of the aminoacyl moiety and enzymatic deacylation. Optimal combinations are presented for three different cases. (i) tRNAPhe from Escherichia coli. This species was isolated by a {{combination of}} low pressure phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic chromatography with RP-HPLC. (ii) tRNAIle from E. coli. Aminoacylation increases the retention time for this tRNA in RP-HPLC. The recovered acylated intermediate is deacylated by reversion of the aminoacylation reaction and submitted to a second RP-HPLC run, in which deacylated tRNAIle is recovered with high specific activity. (iii) <b>tRNAiMet</b> from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The aminoacylated form of this tRNA is unstable. To increase stability, the aminoacylated form was formylated using E. coli enzymes and, after one RP-HPLC step, the formylated derivative was deacylated using peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase from E. coli. The <b>tRNAiMet</b> recovered after a second RP-HPLC run exhibited electrophoretic homogeneity and high specific activity upon aminoacylation. These combinations of chromatographic separation and biochemical modification can be readily adapted to the large-scale isolation of any particular tRNA...|$|E
40|$|RNA {{processing}} and turnover play {{important roles in}} the maturation, metabolism and quality control of a large variety of RNAs thereby contributing to gene expression and cellular health. The TRAMP complex, composed of Air 2 p, Trf 4 p and Mtr 4 p, stimulates nuclear exosome-dependent RNA {{processing and}} degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Mtr 4 protein structure is composed of a helicase core and a novel so-called arch domain, which protrudes from the core. The helicase core contains highly conserved helicase domains RecA- 1 and 2, and two structural domains of unclear functions, winged helix domain (WH) and ratchet domain. How the structural domains (arch, WH and ratchet domain) coordinate with the helicase domains and what roles they are playing in regulating Mtr 4 p helicase activity are unknown. We created a library of Mtr 4 p structural domain mutants {{for the first time}} and screened for those defective in the turnover of TRAMP and exosome substrate, hypomodified <b>tRNAiMet.</b> We found these domains regulate Mtr 4 p enzymatic activities differently through characterizing the arch domain mutants K 700 N and P 731 S, WH mutant K 904 N, and ratchet domain mutant R 1030 G. Arch domain mutants greatly reduced Mtr 4 p RNA binding, which surprisingly did not lead to significant defects on either in vivo <b>tRNAiMet</b> turnover, or in vitro unwinding activities. WH mutant K 904 N and Ratchet domain mutant R 1030 G showed decreased <b>tRNAiMet</b> turnover in vivo, as well as reduced RNA binding, ATPase and unwinding activities of Mtr 4 p in vitro. Particularly, K 904 was found to be very important for steady protein levels in vivo. Overall, we conclude that arch domain plays a role in RNA binding but is largely dispensable for Mtr 4 p enzymatic activities, however the structural domains in the helicase core significantly contribute to Mtr 4 p ATPase and unwinding activities...|$|E
40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a two-subunit methyltransferase (Mtase) encoded by the {{essential}} genes TRM 6 and TRM 61 {{is responsible for}} the formation of 1 -methyladenosine, a modified nucleoside found at position 58 in tRNA that is critical for the stability of <b>tRNAiMet.</b> The crystal structure of the homotetrameric m 1 A 58 tRNA Mtase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, TrmI, has been solved and was used as a template to build a model of the yeast m 1 A 58 tRNA Mtase heterotetramer. We altered amino acids in TRM 6 and TRM 61 that were predicted to be important for the stability of the heteroligomer based on this model. Yeast strains expressing trm 6 and trm 61 mutants exhibited growth phenotypes indicative of reduced m 1 A formation. In addition, recombinant mutant enzymes had reduced in vitro Mtase activity. We demonstrate that the mutations introduced do not prevent heteroligomer formation and do not disrupt binding of the cofactor S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Instead, amino acid substitutions in either Trm 6 p or Trm 61 p destroy the ability of the yeast m 1 A 58 tRNA Mtase to bind <b>tRNAiMet,</b> indicating that each subunit contributes to tRNA binding and suggesting a structural alteration of the substrate-binding pocket occurs when these mutations are present...|$|E
40|$|A third nonallelic {{locus of}} the human methionyl-tRNA multigene family (tRNA(iMet- 3) was isolated. This gene, unlike two other <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> loci, lacks a {{remarkable}} run of T and C residues which functions as a termination of transcription signal. Instead, three tandem termination signals, each containing {{no more than four}} thymidylate residues, function as relatively inefficient termination signals. As a result, polymerase readthrough generates at least three transcripts in vitro. The efficiency of apparent termination varies significantly at these sites. All resulting transcripts appear to be processed in vitro...|$|E

We have noted that the sequences corresponding to nuclear rDNA interon-flanking regions show an intriguing complementarity to <b>tRNAiMet.</b> This suggests possible models for tRNA-rRNA interactions in protein synthesis and/or rRNA splicing...|$|E
40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} translation initiation, the eIF 2 ·GTP/Met-tRNAiMet ternary complex (TC) binds the eIF 3 /eIF 1 /eIF 5 {{complex to}} form the multifactor complex (MFC), whereas eIF 2 ·GDP binds the pentameric factor eIF 2 B for guanine nucleotide exchange. eIF 5 and the eIF 2 Bɛ catalytic subunit possess a conserved eIF 2 -binding site. Nearly half of cellular eIF 2 forms a complex with eIF 5 lacking Met-tRNAiMet, and here we investigate its physiological significance. eIF 5 overexpression increases the abundance of both eIF 2 /eIF 5 and TC/eIF 5 complexes, thereby impeding eIF 2 B reaction and MFC formation, respectively. eIF 2 Bɛ mutations, but not other eIF 2 B mutations, enhance the ability of overexpressed eIF 5 to compete for eIF 2, indicating that interaction of eIF 2 Bɛ with eIF 2 normally disrupts eIF 2 /eIF 5 interaction. Overexpression of the catalytic eIF 2 Bɛ segment similarly exacerbates eIF 5 mutant phenotypes, supporting the ability of eIF 2 Bɛ to compete with MFC. Moreover, we show that eIF 5 overexpression does not generate aberrant MFC lacking <b>tRNAiMet,</b> suggesting that <b>tRNAiMet</b> is a vital component promoting MFC assembly. We propose that the eIF 2 /eIF 5 complex represents a cytoplasmic reservoir for eIF 2 that antagonizes eIF 2 B-promoted guanine nucleotide exchange, enabling coordinated regulation of translation initiation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting {{multifunctional}} proteins (AIMPs) are nonenzymatic scaffolding {{proteins that}} comprise multisynthetase complex (MSC) with nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in higher eukaryotes. Among the three AIMPs, AIMP 3 /p 18 is strongly anchored to methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MRS) in the MSC. MRS attaches methionine (Met) to initiator tRNA (<b>tRNAiMet)</b> and {{plays an important}} role in translation initiation. It is known that AIMP 3 is dispatched to nucleus or nuclear membrane to induce DNA damage response or senescence; however, the role of AIMP 3 in translation as a component of MSC and the meaning of its interaction with MRS are still unclear. Herein, we observed that AIMP 3 specifically interacted with Met-tRNAiMet in vitro, while it showed little or reduced interaction with unacylated or lysine-charged <b>tRNAiMet.</b> In addition, AIMP 3 discriminates Met-tRNAiMet from Met-charged elongator tRNA based on filter-binding assay. Pull‐down assay revealed that AIMP 3 and MRS had noncompetitive interaction with eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF 2) γ subunit (eIF 2 γ), which is in charge of binding with Met-tRNAiMet for the delivery of Met-tRNAiMet to ribosome. AIMP 3 recruited active eIF 2 γ to the MRS–AIMP 3 complex, and the level of Met-tRNAiMet bound to eIF 2 complex was reduced by AIMP 3 knockdown resulting in reduced protein synthesis. All these results suggested the novel function of AIMP 3 as a critical mediator of Met-tRNAiMet transfer from MRS to eIF 2 complex for the accurate and efficient translation initiation...|$|E
40|$|Retroviruses {{and long}} {{terminal}} repeat-containing retroelements use host-encoded tRNAs as primers for {{the synthesis of}} minus strong-stop DNA, the first intermediate in reverse transcription of the retroelement RNA. Usually, one or more specific tRNAs, including the primer, are selected and packaged within the virion. The reverse transcriptase (RT) interacts with the primer tRNA and initiates DNA synthesis. The structural and sequence features of primer tRNAs important for these specific interactions are poorly understood. We have developed a genetic assay in which mutants of <b>tRNA(iMet),</b> the primer for the Ty 1 retrotransposon of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, can be {{tested for the ability}} to serve as primers in the reverse transcription process. This system allows any tRNA mutant to be tested, regardless of its ability to function in the initiation of protein synthesis. We find that mutations in the T psi C loop and the acceptor stem regions of the <b>tRNA(iMet)</b> affect transposition most severely. Conversely, mutations in the anticodon region have only minimal effects on transposition. Further study of the acceptor stem and other mutants demonstrates that complementarity to the element primer binding site is a necessary but not sufficient requirement for effective tRNA priming. Finally, we have used interspecies hybrid initiator tRNA molecules to implicate nucleotides in the D arm as additional recognition determinants. Ty 3 and Ty 1, two very distantly related retrotransposons, require similar molecular determinants in this primer tRNA for transposition...|$|E
40|$|RNA {{processing}} and turnover {{plays an important}} role in RNA maturation, metabolism and quality control, which contribute to gene regulation and cell health. The TRAMP complex, composed of an RNA binding protein Air 2 p, a poly-A polymerase Trf 4 p, and a RNA helicase Mtr 4 p, assist nuclear exosome-dependent RNA {{processing and}} degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, like <b>tRNAiMet</b> turnover, 52 ̆ 7 ETS degradation and rRNA processing. Mtr 4 p structure reveals a novel protruding arch domain, which contains the recognizable KOW domain and a stalk domain. Except for the two conserved RecA-like helicase domains, the helicase core contains two other structural domains, a winged helix that connects arch to the core and a ratchet domain of unknown function. The role of how structural domains assist Mtr 4 p function remains unclear. In this study, I created a library of Mtr 4 p structural domain mutants that were defective in <b>tRNAiMet</b> turnover. KOW domain mutations K 700 N, P 731 S, S 672 N and P 802 S, winged helix mutation K 904 N, and ratchet domain mutation R 1030 G were characterized in cells and biochemically. Mtr 4 - 904 p and Mtr 4 - 1030 p showed significant defects in <b>tRNAiMet</b> turnover in vivo, while the arch domain mutants didn 2 ̆ 7 t cause detectable growth phenotypes. Consistently, Mtr 4 - 904 p and Mtr 4 - 1030 p exhibited decreased in vitro unwinding activities. However, the modest unwinding defect of K 700 N was not reflected in cell. It suggests that structural domains in helicase core are more essential for Mtr 4 p function than that of the arch domain. KOW domain and ratchet domain contributed to RNA binding activities of Mtr 4 p in vitro. Winged helix mutant K 904 N had modest effects on RNA binding in vitro, but showed greater effects on protein stability. Structural domain mutants affected ATPase activities. K 700 N and R 1030 G mutations reduced Mtr 4 p ATP affinity. Overall, the results revealed that residues in structural domains affect Mtr 4 p enzymatic activities from different aspects. In addition, I showed that single-stranded RNA is a preferred substrate for Mtr 4 p binding, and activates higher enzymatic activity of Mtr 4 p. My results also demonstrate that, as a helicase, Mtr 4 p is able to modulate the balance between unwinding and re-annealing in a concentration and ATP dependent manner...|$|E
40|$|We {{identified}} a mutation in the 60 S ribosomal protein L 33 A (rpl 33 a-G 76 R) that elicits derepression of GCN 4 translation (Gcd− phenotype) by allowing scanning preinitiation complexes to bypass inhibitory upstream {{open reading frame}} 4 (uORF 4) independently of prior uORF 1 translation and reinitiation. At 37 °C, rpl 33 a-G 76 R confers defects in 60 S biogenesis comparable to those produced by the deletion of RPL 33 A (ΔA). At 28 °C, however, the 60 S biogenesis defect is less severe in rpl 33 a-G 76 R than in ΔA cells, yet rpl 33 a-G 76 R confers greater derepression of GCN 4 and a larger reduction in general translation. Hence, it appears that rpl 33 a-G 76 R has a stronger effect on ribosomal-subunit joining than does a comparable reduction of wild-type 60 S levels conferred by ΔA. We suggest that rpl 33 a-G 76 R alters the 60 S subunit {{in a way that}} impedes ribosomal-subunit joining and thereby allows 48 S rRNA complexes to abort initiation at uORF 4, resume scanning, and initiate downstream at GCN 4. Because overexpressing <b>tRNAiMet</b> suppresses the Gcd− phenotype of rpl 33 a-G 76 R cells, dissociation of <b>tRNAiMet</b> from the 40 S subunit may be responsible for abortive initiation at uORF 4 in this mutant. We further demonstrate that rpl 33 a-G 76 R impairs the efficient processing of 35 S and 27 S pre-rRNAs and reduces the accumulation of all four mature rRNAs, indicating an important role for L 33 in the biogenesis of both ribosomal subunits...|$|E
