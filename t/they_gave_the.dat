In this {{instance}} <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> rights to El Espantito ("The Little Terror"), a Mini-Estrella. In the early 2000s he worked for AAA in their Mini division. In 2009 Espantito and Octagoncito wrestled for the vacant NWA World Midget's Championship, which Octagoncito won.|$|E

5|$|Following World War I (a {{period when}} the Machine Gun Corps was based in the park, as {{referred}} to in Henry Williamson's Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight), the Brownlows, like many of their peers, were faced with mounting financial problems. In 1984 <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> house away—complete with most of its contents. The recipients of their gift, the National Trust, today fully open Belton to the public.

5|$|The local legend {{suggests}} that the Cailleach and her family were given shelter in the glen by the locals and while they stayed there the glen was always fertile and prosperous. When they left <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> stones to the locals with the promise {{that as long as}} the stones were put out to look over the glen at Bealltainn and put back into the shelter and made secure for the winter at Samhainn then the glen would continue to be fertile.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Desmond goes nude {{swimming}} {{was not included in}} the same form in Etheridge's version of the episode; however, Thomas enjoyed the take that was eventually used more, so he put it in the final cut. Because the show could not show full nudity, <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> stunt performer who was filling in for Rudd flesh-colored swim briefs and put him out of focus so they could notify the network that the man out of focus was indeed clothed. The lights that can be seen in the distant background of the scene illuminating the bay were placed nearly ten miles away by grips.|$|E
5|$|When {{the auction}} closed, it had {{received}} the third highest number of viewers of Trade Me auctions, at 459,420 views. The winning bid was $26,000, placed by a consortium of eight demolition contractors who currently undertake demolitions in the Christchurch Central City (D Construction, Dormer Construction, Jurgens Demolition, March Construction, Pro Tranz Contracting, Clampet Developments, Shilton and Brown Demolition, and Ward's Demolition). <b>They</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> right to choose a person to push the button to the Child Cancer Foundation, who nominated a six-year-old boy from Queenstown.|$|E

5|$|The conference {{failed to}} produce a settlement, {{breaking}} up {{on the same day}} it began with each side blaming the other for its unsuccessful outcome. Smith believed the nationalists were being unreasonable by requesting preconditions for talks—which they had previously agreed not to do—and asking for diplomatic immunity for their leaders and fighters. The nationalists contended that Smith was being deliberately intransigent and that they did not believe he was sincere in seeking an agreement if he was so adamant about not giving diplomatic immunity. Direct talks {{between the government and the}} Zimbabwe African People's Union followed in December 1975, but these also {{failed to produce}} any significant progress. The Victoria Falls Conference, the détente initiative and the associated ceasefire, though unsuccessful, did affect the course of the Rhodesian Bush War, as <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> nationalist guerrillas significant time to regroup and reorganise themselves following the decisive security force counter-campaign of 1973–74. A further conference would follow in 1976, this time in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{most people}} in the western world know the planets by names derived from the Olympian pantheon of gods. Although modern Greeks still use their ancient names for the planets, other European languages, because of the {{influence}} of the Roman Empire and, later, the Catholic Church, use the Roman (Latin) names rather than the Greek ones. The Romans, who, like the Greeks, were Indo-Europeans, shared with them a common pantheon under different names but lacked the rich narrative traditions that Greek poetic culture had given their gods. During the later period of the Roman Republic, Roman writers borrowed much of the Greek narratives and applied them to their own pantheon, {{to the point where they}} became virtually indistinguishable. When the Romans studied Greek astronomy, <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> planets their own gods' names: Mercurius (for Hermes), Venus (Aphrodite), Mars (Ares), Iuppiter (Zeus) and Saturnus (Cronus). When subsequent planets were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, the naming practice was retained with Neptūnus (Poseidon). Uranus is unique in that it is named for a Greek deity rather than his Roman counterpart.|$|E
5|$|Both Acts were {{unusual in}} that <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> bodies powers to borrow money, {{but did not}} create the {{companies}} to do the work. Nor were the financial arrangements clearly laid down, and both groups resorted to issuing shares to fund the improvements, although they were not actually empowered to do so. In October 1730, the two groups decided to amalgamate, but a 1731 Act to formalise the agreement and legalise the issuing of shares was defeated because it also included powers to make further changes to the river, including the section below Barnby Dun. Finally an Act of 1733 created The Company of the Proprietors of the Navigation of the River Don, with powers {{to create a new}} cut from Bromley Sands above Rotherham to Ickles Dam. The problems presented by the river below Wilsick House, including shallows and fords at Bramwith and Stainforth, and bridges on the Dutch River that were difficult to navigate, resulted in the proprietors trying again to obtain powers to improve the lower river in 1737, but again the petition was defeated in a parliamentary committee. Work continued, and it appears that Aldwarke was the head of navigation for some years, but Rotherham was reached in 1740.|$|E

If the perjurers testified that a priest was {{a son of a}} divorcee (thus disqualifying the son as a priest) or the son of a woman who had been declined in Levirate marriage (a woman who had received halizah, once again disqualifying the son as a priest), they did not order that each perjurer be stigmatized as born of a divorcee or a woman declined in Levirate marriage. Rather, <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> perjurer 40 lashes. If the perjurers testified that a person was guilty of a charge punishable by banishment, they did not banish the perjurers.
