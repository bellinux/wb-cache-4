5|$|In 1978, the {{building}} likely used asbestos shingles {{for the front}} roofing, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have been removed by later renovations.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{involves}} monitoring as well {{as physical}} and cognitive rest (reduction of such activities as school work, playing video games and text messaging). Symptoms usually resolve within three weeks, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> persist or complications may occur.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the baths {{served as}} {{community}} spaces for gay men. Even now, some men {{choose to go}} to the baths with their friends (even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not necessarily have sex with each other). While many men talk to each other at the baths, even forming long-lasting friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, anonymity.|$|E
50|$|Formal {{symbols are}} usually {{thought of as}} purely {{syntactic}} structures, composed into larger structures using a formal grammar, <b>though</b> sometimes <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be associated with an interpretation or model (a formal semantics).|$|R
50|$|The term Polyanthus, or P. polyantha, {{refers to}} various tall-stemmed and multi-coloured strains of P. vulgaris x P. veris hybrids. <b>Though</b> perennial, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be {{short-lived}} and are typically grown from seed or from young plants as biennials.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that married men {{feel as if they}} are expected to pursue fatherhood as a part of their marriage <b>though</b> <b>they</b> personally <b>may</b> not want to have children. On the other hand, men who are single and younger do not feel the same desire because they are not [...] "prepared" [...] to emotionally and financially support a child.|$|R
5|$|Zinc {{supplements}} {{may help}} to reduce the frequency of colds. Routine vitamin C supplements do not reduce the risk or severity of the common cold, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> reduce its duration. Gargling with water was found useful in one small trial.|$|E
5|$|A {{brain tumor}} is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, {{and can be}} cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary brain tumors are malignant; the rest are benign, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more common than primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E
5|$|Bats may avoid flying {{during the}} day to prevent {{overheating}} in the sun, since their dark wing-membranes absorb solar radiation. Bats {{may not be able}} to dissipate heat if the ambient temperature is too high. Unlike birds which have air sacs or other mammals which have sweat glands, bats have no means to cool themselves by evaporation, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> use saliva to cool themselves in an emergency.|$|E
60|$|I {{know that}} this queer {{adventure}} of the Gay-Header's will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> themselves <b>may</b> have either seen or heard of some one's falling into a cistern ashore; an accident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than the Indian's, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale's well.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "cod war" [...] {{was coined}} by a British {{journalist}} in early September 1958. None of the Cod Wars meets {{any of the}} common thresholds for a conventional war, <b>though,</b> and <b>they</b> <b>may</b> more accurately be described as militarized interstate disputes. There is only one confirmed death during the Cod Wars: an Icelandic engineer killed in the Second Cod War.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There at {{any rate}} you are wrong. Their {{marriage}} laws {{are not the same}} as ours, <b>though</b> how <b>they</b> <b>may</b> differ you and I probably do not accurately know. And <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be altered at any time as <b>they</b> <b>may</b> please. Let the laws be what they will, it is quite possible, after what you have told me, that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> bring up evidence which you would find it very difficult to refute. I don't think it will be so. If I did I should use all my influence to remove my sister at once.' ...|$|R
5|$|Reconstructions of ankylosaur forelimb {{musculature}} made by Coombs in 1978 {{suggest that}} the forelimbs bore {{the majority of the}} animal's weight, and were adapted for high force delivery on the front feet, possibly for food gathering. In addition, Coombs suggested that ankylosaurs may have been capable diggers, though the hoof-like structure of the manus would have limited fossorial activity. Ankylosaurs were likely to have been slow-moving and sluggish animals, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have been capable of quick movements when necessary.|$|E
5|$|The diet of Pteranodon {{is known}} to have {{included}} fish; fossilized fish bones have been found in the stomach area of one Pteranodon, and a fossilized fish bolus has been found between the jaws of another Pteranodon, specimen AMNH 5098. Numerous other specimens also preserve fragments of fish scales and vertebrae near the torso, indicating that fish made up a majority of the diet of Pteranodon (<b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> also have taken invertebrates).|$|E
5|$|The eggs of Lepidoptera {{are usually}} rounded and small (1mm) <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be {{as large as}} 4mm {{in the case of}} Sphingidae and Saturniidae. They are {{generally}} quite plain in colour, white, pale green, bluish-green, or brown. Butterfly and moth eggs come in various shapes; some are spherical, others hemispherical, conical, cylindrical or lenticular (lens-shaped). Some are barrel-shaped or pancake-shaped, while others are turban or cheese-shaped. They may be angled or depressed at both ends, ridged or ornamented, spotted or blemished.|$|E
6000|$|The dying exclamation of the Emperor Augustus, [...] "Has it {{not been}} well acted?" [...] An essay on the misery of being always under a mask. A veil may be needful, but never a mask. Instances of people who wear masks in all classes of society, and never take them off {{even in the most}} {{familiar}} moments, <b>though</b> sometimes <b>they</b> <b>may</b> chance to slip aside.|$|R
2500|$|The group's first {{recorded}} attack was against Fox.com's website, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> still <b>may</b> {{have been using}} the name Internet Feds at the time. It claimed responsibility for leaking information, including passwords, altering several employees' LinkedIn profiles, and leaking a database of X Factor contestants containing contact information of 73,000 contestants. They claimed to do so because the rapper Common had {{been referred to as}} [...] "vile" [...] on air.|$|R
5|$|A dolphinarium is an {{aquarium}} for dolphins. The dolphins are usually {{kept in a}} large pool, <b>though</b> occasionally <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be kept in pens in the open sea, either for research or for public performances. Some dolphinariums consist of one pool where dolphins perform for the public, others are part of larger parks, such as marine mammal parks, zoos or theme parks, with other animals and attractions as well.|$|R
5|$|The superb fairywren is a {{cooperative}} breeding species, with pairs {{or groups of}} 3–5 birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. The group consists of a social pair {{with one or more}} male or female helper birds that were hatched in the territory, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not necessarily be the offspring of the main pair. These birds assist in defending the territory and feeding and rearing the young. Birds in a group roost side-by-side in dense cover as well as engaging in mutual preening.|$|E
5|$|These species {{live in a}} {{wide variety}} of habitats, ranging from dry {{deciduous}} forests to rainforests, and run quadrupedally across branches. Their diet consists primarily of tree gum and other exudates, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> obtain some of their protein and nitrogen by hunting small arthropods later at night. Three of the four species are endangered and the other is listed as vulnerable. Their populations are in decline due to habitat destruction. Like all lemurs, they are protected against commercial trade under CITES Appendix I.|$|E
5|$|Whitetip reef {{sharks are}} rarely {{aggressive}} towards humans, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> investigate swimmers closely. However, spear fishers {{are at risk}} of being bitten by one attempting to steal their catch. This species is caught for food, though ciguatera poisoning resulting from its consumption has been reported. The IUCN has assessed the whitetip reef shark as Near Threatened, noting its numbers are dwindling due to increasing levels of unregulated fishing activity across its range. The slow reproductive rate and limited habitat preferences of this species renders its populations vulnerable to overfishing.|$|E
5000|$|Chinese export {{porcelain}} {{includes a}} wide range of Chinese porcelain that was made (almost) exclusively for export to Europe and later to North America between the 16th and the 20th century. Whether wares made for non-Western markets are covered by the term depends on context. Chinese ceramics made mainly for export go back to the Tang dynasty if not earlier, <b>though</b> initially <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not be regarded as porcelain.|$|R
50|$|According to Malcolm Guthrie, Kikongo {{is in the}} {{language}} group H10, the Kongo languages. Other languages in the same group include Bembe (H11). Ethnologue 16 counts Ndingi (H14) and Mboka (H15) as dialects of Kongo, <b>though</b> it acknowledges <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be distinct languages.|$|R
50|$|Finalists are {{selected}} {{during the final}} session {{at the end of}} workshops week. Dancers perform their final choreographed routine (usually in groups of 5 or 6) in front of the judges panel and the guest choreographer. After all groups have performed, the judges panel addresses each remaining contestant individually and reveals whether they will remain in the competition for the live shows, <b>though</b> sometimes <b>they</b> <b>may</b> ask for one last solo before making this determination.|$|R
5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. <b>Though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E
5|$|In towns, the Cape sparrow {{competes with}} both the native {{southern}} grey-headed sparrow and house sparrow, which was introduced to southern Africa in the 19thcentury. Since it is more established around humans in its range than either, it successfully competes with both species, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> exclude it from nesting in holes. A survey by birdwatchers completed in 2000 found the Cape sparrow increasing in abundance in some suburban areas of South Africa (the northern Johannesburg area, and Pietermaritzburg) and decreasing in others (the southern Cape Town area). The house sparrow was reported decreasing in several urban areas, {{as it has in}} parts of Europe, declines which are attributed to factors including the increasing density of garden plantings and increases in predation.|$|E
5|$|Like wolves, coyotes use a den (usually {{the deserted}} holes of other species) when gestating and rearing young, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> {{occasionally}} give birth under sagebrushes in the open. Coyote dens can {{be located in}} canyons, washouts, coulees, banks, rock bluffs, or level ground. Some dens have been found under abandoned homestead shacks, grain bins, drainage pipes, railroad tracks, hollow logs, thickets, and thistles. The den is continuously dug and cleaned out by the female until the pups are born. Should the den be disturbed or infested with fleas, the pups are moved into another den. A coyote den can have several entrances and passages branching out from the main chamber. A single den can be used year after year.|$|E
50|$|The Rotoitidae are a {{very small}} family of rare, relictual {{parasitic}} wasps in the superfamily Chalcidoidea. Only two species are known, each in its own genus, one from New Zealand and one from Chile. They are the most recently discovered family of chalcidoids (<b>though,</b> ironically, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be the most ancient lineage), and nothing is known about their biology. Females of the Chilean species, Chiloe micropteron, have their wings reduced to tiny bristles.|$|R
50|$|The Legislative Assembly {{consists}} of eight elected members, two ex officio members (the Chief Executive and the Director of Finance), and the Speaker. Although they {{take part in}} proceedings, the ex officio members {{do not have the}} right to vote in the Legislative Assembly. The Commander British Forces and the Attorney General also have the right to take part in the proceedings of the Legislative Assembly, <b>though</b> again <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not vote.|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} Hyphaene species, H. petersiana is dioicous {{and the female}} plants produce copious fruit of some 60 mm diameter. Up to 2,000 fruit may be found on a tree, the {{combined}} yield of about four seasons. The seeds germinate with difficulty but find saline conditions beneficial. They develop massive tap-roots which draw saline water deep underground. <b>Though</b> slow-growing, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> attain a maximum height of 18m. Typical adult plants are {{in the order of}} 5-7m high.|$|R
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} characteristic of Pteranodon is its cranial crest. These crests consisted of skull bones (frontals) projecting upward and backward from the skull. The {{size and shape}} of these crests varied due to a number of factors, including age, sex, and species. Male Pteranodon sternbergi, the older species of the two described to date (and sometimes placed in the distinct genus Geosternbergia), had a more vertical crest with a broad forward projection, while their descendants, Pteranodon longiceps, evolved a narrower, more backward-projecting crest. Females of both species were smaller and bore small, rounded crests. The crests were probably mainly display structures, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have had other functions as well.|$|E
5|$|The typical summer {{weather pattern}} is for heat-produced thermals, powered {{by either the}} Gulf or Atlantic sea breeze (and {{occasionally}} both simultaneously), to build puffy white cumulus clouds into threatening thunderheads over {{the interior of the}} Florida peninsula. Usually, the resulting storms drift slowly westward to the bay area, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> rain themselves out before reaching Tampa if the easterly winds are light or the sea breeze from the Gulf of Mexico is too strong. Occasionally, the storms survive to move out over the Gulf of Mexico, where they can be seen at night from the beaches as spectacular light shows. Nighttime storms offshore are driven by the land-breeze front which is the dermal counterpart of the daytime sea-breeze front.|$|E
5|$|Turquoise parrots are {{encountered}} in pairs or small groups consisting {{of parents and}} several offspring, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> congregate into larger flocks of up to 75 predominantly juvenile birds outside the breeding season. As the breeding season nears, pairs separate out from these flocks. Turquoise parrots roost together communally in autumn and winter. At night they roost among the foliage of trees such as gums or wattles, anywhere from 1 to 8m (3–25ft) above the ground. They retreat to trees near their feeding areas during the day. The calls of the turquoise parrot have been little-studied; birds give a high-pitched soft contact call when feeding or in flight, while the alarm call {{has been described as}} a high-pitched zitting call. Turquoise parrots also chatter when settling to roost in the evening.|$|E
2500|$|Females usually attach their egg sacs on {{vegetation}} and other surfaces near {{the edges of}} their webs (including grass blades, leaves, and twigs). They are usually bound longitudinally with loose lengths of silk, but they can sometimes be found dangling. The egg sacs are around [...] in length and can vary in shape from circular to pointed at both ends. They are reddish brown to golden brown in colour, <b>though</b> rarely <b>they</b> <b>may</b> also be bright yellow. They are made from closely woven silk.|$|R
5000|$|Capital Metro's Express {{services}} are limited stop services that run between Downtown Austin {{and the far}} suburbs. Express routes are designated as routes 900-999, and are served exclusively by buses in the red [...] "MetroExpress" [...] livery (<b>though</b> on occasions <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be served by buses in the regular Capital Metro livery as well). Commuter fares apply.|$|R
5000|$|Maruya (...) {{is a type}} of fritter {{from the}} Philippines. It is usually made from saba bananas. The most common variant is {{prepared}} by coating thinly sliced and [...] "fanned" [...] bananas in batter and deep frying them. They are then sprinkled with sugar. <b>Though</b> not traditional, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> also be served with slices of jackfruit preserved in syrup or ice cream.|$|R
