The 1st Puerto Rican Provisional Battalion, composed of the Talavera Cavalry and Krupp artillery, was sent to Santiago de Cuba where they battled the American forces in the Battle of San Juan Hill. After the battle, the Puerto Rican battalion suffered a total of 70 casualties which included their dead, wounded, MIA's and prisoners. The Spanish appointed Governor of Puerto Rico, Manuel Macías y Casado, declared martial law, resolving to resist the American forces. He declared: 'Providence will not permit that in these countries which were discovered by the Spanish nation <b>the</b> <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> our language should ever cease to be heard, nor that our flag should disappear before the eyes…. Long live Puerto Rico, always Spanish. Long live Spain." [...] Macías y Casado hoped that a grant of autonomy would ensure that Puerto Ricans would remain loyal to the Spanish crown.|$|E

Down late, Florida went 80 yards in eight plays, including a 31-yard pass to Anthony, down to the 3-yard line. A short pass to Anthony brought Florida within a field goal with just over a minute left. The subsequent onside kick went out of bounds, and the game was sealed when Dunn ran for a first down.

It chanced that I had written a tale about Indian Forestry work which included a boy who had been brought up by wolves. In the stillness, and suspense, of the winter of ’92 some memory of the Masonic Lions of my childhood's magazine, and a phrase in Haggard's Nada the Lily, combined with <b>the</b> <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> this tale. After blocking out the main idea in my head, the pen took charge, and I watched it begin to write stories about Mowgli and animals, which later grew into the two Jungle Books [...] ".

2500|$|Beyond the Symbolist context, Theodorescu-Sion's primitivism {{was a form}} {{of social}} investigation. G. Duma was among the early ones to {{describe}} Sion as the voice of a specific Romanian sensibility: [...] "Theodorescu-Sion's art is <b>the</b> <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> a people's feelings [...] It is the atavism of our purest art [...] The artist creates, and the people he represents lives on through him, making it known to all other nations with definitive characteristics that [...] the sources of its own dreams are coming to light under a creative power. [...] One feels spiritually connected to Theodorescu-Sion, because one finds, buried into his pastures, the labor and suffering of a race that has produced the painter himself." [...] According to Anca Gogîltan, the Tinerimea art show of 1910 was a watershed moment in the relationship between urban modern art and the rural majority of Romania, as both Theodorescu-Sion and Camil Ressu tackled rural life without idyllic conventionalism or moral indignation. She refers in particular to Sion's Transylvanian-themed Arat în Munții Abrudului ("Ploughing in the Mountains of Abrud"), [...] "underlining man's civilizing action" [...] rather than expressing [...] "social critique". Prior to World War I, Gogîltan argues, Sion and Ressu were the visual partners of Romanian agrarianism (or Poporanism), seeking to emphasize, like Mihail Sadoveanu in the literary field, the [...] "dignity", [...] "resilience" [...] and economic importance of the Romanian peasantry.|$|E
