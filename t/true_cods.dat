5000|$|The Gadidae are {{a family}} of marine fish, {{included}} in the order Gadiformes, known as the cods, codfishes or <b>true</b> <b>cods.</b> [...] It contains several commercially important fishes, including the cod, haddock, whiting, and pollock.|$|E
50|$|The {{saffron cod}} (Eleginus gracilis), is a commercially {{harvested}} fish {{closely related to}} <b>true</b> <b>cods</b> (genus Gadus). It is dark grey-green to brown, with spots on its sides and pale towards the belly. It may grow to 60 cm and weigh up to 1.3 kg.|$|E
50|$|The pelagic cod {{is found}} in subantarctic and {{temperate}} waters, occasionally being caught in the tropics. It may be found at depths between 150 and 3600 m. It is from the order Gadiformes, related to <b>true</b> <b>cods.</b> It may grow up to 19 cm in length. It has no commercial value.|$|E

50|$|USS Pollack (SS-180), a , was {{the first}} ship of the United States Navy to be named for the pollack, a food fish {{resembling}} the <b>true</b> <b>cod,</b> but with the lower jaw projecting and without the barbel.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The {{proteolytic}} enzymes in {{the muscle}} fluid of Pacific whiting (Merluccius productus) were studied and {{compared to those}} found in muscle fluid of <b>true</b> <b>cod</b> (Gadus macrocephalus). Preliminary studies indicated three pH optima of activity for whiting, pH 3. 5 - 3. 9, 4. 3 - 4. 6 and 7. 1 - 7. 2. Only two pH optima were found for the proteolytic activity of <b>true</b> <b>cod,</b> pH 3. 2 - 3. 6 and 7. 7 - 8. 0. The sarcoplasmic fluid of whiting and cod muscle was studied in more detail. For both whiting and cod, no hydrolysis of the substrates hippuryl-L-phenylalanine, hippuryl-L-arginine, α-N-benzoyl-D,L-arginine p-nitroanilide (BAPA), or toluene sulfonyl arginine methyl ester (TAMA) at neutral pH's could be detected, indicating the absence of trypsin and carboxypeptidases A and B. Neither whiting nor cod contained elastase and only whiting was shown to have activity similar to that of cathepsin B. <b>True</b> <b>cod</b> was found to contain higher chymotrypsin activity than whiting at pH 7. 15 using the substrate glutaryl-L-phenylalanine p-nitroanilide. Hydrolysis of the substrate glutaryl-L-phenylalanine β-naphthylamide (Gly-Phe- 2 -naphthylamide) from pH 5 to 8 occurred to a greater extent in Pacific whiting than in <b>true</b> <b>cod.</b> Various inhibitors and activators were used to characterize the enzymes in whiting and cod muscle hydrolyzing the substrates GPNA and Gly-Phe- 2 -naphthylamide. The responses to the chemicals were compared with the effects reported in the literature on the hydrolysis of the substrates by enzymes found in other animal sources...|$|R
5000|$|The sleepy cod (Oxyeleotris lineolata) is a {{medium-sized}} sleeper goby, native to tropical fresh waters of northern Australia and questionably from New Guinea. It {{is a member}} of the order Perciformes, thus is unrelated to the <b>true</b> <b>cods</b> in the order Gadiformes. Neither are they closely related to the Australian freshwater cods such as the Murray cod of the family Maccullochella.|$|E
50|$|The rock cod (Lotella rhacina) is a {{temperate}} fish found off {{the coasts}} of southeastern Australia, Tasmania, the Great Australian Bight and northwards up the south western Australia coasts. They are also found around {{the coasts of}} New Zealand and California. They belong to the family Moridae and {{are not related to}} the <b>true</b> <b>cods</b> (genus Gadus). They are also known as beardie in Australia.|$|E
50|$|The East Siberian cod (Arctogadus borisovi) {{also known}} as the toothed cod, is an Arctic fish closely similar to the Arctic cod Arctogadus glacialis and also related to <b>true</b> <b>cods</b> (genus Gadus). It has been {{differentiated}} in appearance from the Arctic cod by having pronounced chin barbel. Their sides and back are dark olive and the belly are light grey with dark spots. They may grow up to 60 cm.|$|E
50|$|USS Pollack (SSN-603), a Permit-class attack submarine, was {{the second}} ship of the United States Navy to be named for the pollack, a food fish {{resembling}} the <b>true</b> <b>cod,</b> but with the lower jaw projecting and without the barbel.|$|R
50|$|Boreogadus saida, {{known as}} the polar cod or as the Arctic cod, is a fish of the cod family Gadidae, related to the <b>true</b> <b>cod</b> (genus Gadus). Another fish species for which both the common names Arctic cod and polar cod are used is Arctogadus glacialis.|$|R
50|$|Arctogadus glacialis, known {{also with}} {{ambiguous}} common names Arctic cod and polar cod, is an Arctic {{species of fish}} in the cod family Gadidae, related to the <b>true</b> <b>cod</b> (genus Gadus). Arctogadus glacialis is found in icy water. They grow to about 30 cm long, and are favorite food of narwhals and other arctic whales.|$|R
50|$|The tadpole cod is {{a member}} of the family Moridae, the morid cods, related to the <b>true</b> <b>cods</b> (of genus Gadus, family Gadidae). Like the {{familiar}} Atlantic cod, it has small whiskers (barbels) on its mouth. Specimens have been measured up to 18 cm. It has no commercial value, and is not currently believed to be endangered. Not much is known about this species, being discovered in 1986.|$|E
50|$|The small-headed cod or long-finned cod, Lepidion microcephalus, is a {{deepwater}} fish {{belonging to}} the morid cod family (Moridae), and related to the <b>true</b> <b>cods</b> (genus Gadus). It {{is found in the}} Tasman Sea, including Bass Straits, and is commercially harvested by both Australia and New Zealand. It has been found on the continental shelf, but typically its depth range is from 750 to 1000 m. It grows to 48 cm in total length.|$|E
5000|$|The Maori cod (Paranotothenia magellanica), {{also known}} as Magellanic rockcod, blue notothenia or orange throat notothen, is a species of cod icefish native to the Southern Ocean. [...] "Maori chief" [...] and [...] "black cod", {{sometimes}} used for this species, usually refer to fishes from the related genus Notothenia. It occurs at depths of from near the surface to 255 m, though it is usually found at less than 20 m This species can reach a length of 38 cm SL. Being a perciform fish it is unrelated to the <b>true</b> <b>cods</b> of the order Gadiformes. This species is commercially important as a food fish.|$|E
50|$|Initially {{described}} by French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1802, the Coral trout {{belongs to a}} family of fish known as the Serranidae. This family includes groupers and coral cod (not related to <b>true</b> <b>cod),</b> which are all characterised by having three spines on the gill cover and a large mouth lined {{with more than one}} row of sharp teeth.|$|R
5000|$|Being a sub-Antarctic species, {{the black}} cod has special adaptations such as {{antifreeze}} proteins in its blood, {{as well as}} adipose tissues to offset its lack of swim bladders, giving it neutral buoyancy. Sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, is occasionally called black cod as well, {{but it is not}} a <b>true</b> <b>cod.</b> In New Zealand, Maori cod is also known as [...] "black cod".|$|R
25|$|Almost all coral cod, reef cod or rock cod {{are also}} in order Perciformes. Most are better known as groupers, and belong to the family Serranidae. Others belong to the Nototheniidiae. Two {{exceptions}} are the Australasian red rock cod, which belongs to a different order (see below), and the fish known simply as the rock cod and as soft cod in New Zealand, Lotella rhacina, which as noted above actually {{is related to the}} <b>true</b> <b>cod</b> (it is a morid cod).|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{effects of}} ambient {{temperature}} storage on {{the chemical and}} nutritional characteristics of phosphoric and sorbic acid-stabilized fish autolysates were determined. Variations in sample composition due to autolysis, deboning, and acidification were also evaluated. Autolysates of English sole (Parophrys vetulus), <b>true</b> <b>cod</b> (Gadus macrocephalus), Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus), and orange rockfish (Sebastodes pinniger) carcass wastes, whole Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) and dogfish shark (Squalis acanthias), and a hake/tuna viscera (70 / 30 wt/wt) mixture were utilized in the investigation.

500|$|The name Tiktaalik is an Inuktitut {{word meaning}} [...] "burbot", a {{freshwater}} fish related to <b>true</b> <b>cod.</b> The [...] "fishapod" [...] genus received this name after a suggestion by Inuit elders of Canada's Nunavut Territory, where the fossil was discovered. The specific name roseae cryptically honours an anonymous donor. Taking a detailed {{look at the}} internal head skeleton of Tiktaalik roseae, in the October 16, 2008, issue of Nature, researchers show how Tiktaalik was gaining structures that could allow it to support itself on solid ground and breathe air, a key intermediate step in {{the transformation of the}} skull that accompanied the shift to life on land by our distant ancestors.|$|R
50|$|Suspicion {{has arisen}} {{that the writer}} of the Reactor Mailer program might be the same person {{responsible}} for the Srizbi trojan, as code analysis shows a code fingerprint that matches between the two programs. If this claim is indeed <b>true,</b> then this <b>coder</b> might well {{be responsible for the}} trojan behind another botnet, named Rustock. According to Symantec, the code used in the Srizbi trojan is very similar to the code found in the Rustock trojan, and could well be an improved version of the latter.|$|R
40|$|In a study {{aimed at}} {{improving}} {{the reliability of the}} Norwegian bottom sampling trawl, comparative fishing between standard bobbins gear and rockhopper ground gear were carried out in the Barents Sea. The catch ratios bobbins/ rockhopper (B/R) for cod and haddock show a higher efficiency for rockhopper than for bobbins, especially for small fish. The catch ratio B/R for cod varied by time of day. Rockhopper seemed to have a higher efficiency compared to bobbins during daytime. The same trend was not found for haddock. These experiments confirm earlier experiments that rockhoppper is more effective than bobbins gear in catching fish close to the bottom. This is particulary <b>true</b> for small <b>cod...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the survival of}} gadoid fish in the Barents Sea escaping from a demersal trawl during commercial fishing conditions, with and without a sorting grid, at high {{and low levels of}} fishing intensity. The mortality of cod and saithe was negligible and unrelated to experimental conditions. Haddock mortality was generally greater than observed in earlier experiments and inversely related to fish length. Any possible effects of experimental conditions were hidden by large variability in the observed rates of mortality. We conclude that the observed mortality of haddock is confounded by methodological problems, particularly the instability of the observation cages, and does not reflect the <b>true</b> escape mortality. <b>Cod</b> and saithe are capable of surviving the stress of passage through, and escape from, the trawl, whereas haddock are more vulnerable, despite being a closely related species...|$|R
40|$|Change of {{direction}} (COD) ability {{is an important}} physical fitness capacity required in conjunction with cognitiveperceptual ability to perform effective and efficient agility manoeuvres in many sports. Although, the physical capacity to change direction is often measured by strength and conditioning professionals, the ability of these common COD tests (presented as time to complete a running task) to truly measure one’s ability to decelerate and subsequently reaccelerate {{in a new direction}} is often tangled within one’s ability to perform straight line running. This has been demonstrated with large to very large correlations found between COD tests and straight-line sprint speed in various studies. The reason for continuing to use these common COD tests, such as the T-test, 505 and proagility is often due to existing data to compare athlete performances and ease of data collection. Some researchers have used the velocity of the centre of mass as a <b>true</b> measure of <b>COD</b> ability. Although assessing COD ability by measuring athlete COM out of a COD step provides a direct measure of COD ability, the scope for strength and conditioning professionals {{to be able to use}} this type of assessment is small due to time and equipment constraints. A proposed method, termed “change {{of direction}} deficit”, to assess COD ability was calculated to assess if this measure could better isolate COD ability independent of one’s straight-line sprint ability...|$|R
