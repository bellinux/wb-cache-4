The property included an 18-hole golf course which hosted <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> Tournament of Champions from 1953 to 1966.

5|$|The Desert Inn's {{most famous}} guest, {{businessman}} Howard Hughes, arrived on Thanksgiving Day 1966, renting the hotel's entire top two floors. After staying past his initial ten-day reservation, {{he was asked}} to leave in December so that the resort could accommodate the high rollers who were expected for New Year's Eve. Instead of leaving, Hughes started negotiations to buy the Desert Inn. On March 27, 1967, Hughes purchased the resort from Dalitz for $6.2 million in cash and $7 million in loans. This was the first of many Las Vegas resort purchases by Hughes, including the Sands Hotel and Casino ($14.6 million) and the Frontier Hotel and Casino ($23 million). However, Hughes refused to include <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> Tournament of Champions in the deal, so Dalitz moved the tournament to his Stardust Resort and Casino in 1967 and 1968.|$|E

5|$|Woods {{began his}} 2012 season with two tournaments (the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship and the AT Pebble Beach National Pro-Am) {{where he started}} off well, but {{struggled}} on the final rounds. Following the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, where he was knocked out {{in the second round}} by missing a 5-foot putt, Woods revised his putting technique and tied for second at the Honda Classic, with the lowest final round score in his PGA Tour career. After a short time off due to another leg injury, Woods won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, his first win on <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> since the BMW Championship in September 2009. Following several dismal performances, Woods notched his 73rd PGA Tour win at the Memorial Tournament in June, tying Jack Nicklaus in second place for most PGA Tour victories; a month later, Woods surpassed Nicklaus with a win at the AT National, to trail only Sam Snead, who accumulated 82 PGA tour wins.|$|E

5|$|Woods' {{performance}} {{continued to}} suffer in 2011, {{taking its toll}} on his ranking. After falling to No. 7 in March, he rebounded to No. 5 with a strong showing at the 2011 Masters Tournament, where he tied for fourth place. Due to leg injuries incurred at the Masters, he missed several summer stops on <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour.</b> In July, he fired his longtime caddy Steve Williams (who {{was shocked by the}} dismissal), and replaced him on an interim basis with friend Bryon Bell. After returning to tournament play in August, Woods continued to falter, and his ranking gradually fell to a low of #58. He rose to No. 50 in mid-November after a third-place finish at the Emirates Australian Open, and broke his winless streak with a victory at December's Chevron World Challenge.|$|E
5|$|Woods had a poor showing at the 2013 U.S Open as {{a result}} of an elbow injury {{sustained}} at The Players Championship. In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score ever as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner Justin Rose. After a prolonged break because of the injury, during which he missed the Greenbrier Classic and his own AT National, he returned at the Open Championship at Muirfield. Despite being in contention all week and beginning the final round only two strokes behind Lee Westwood, he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 that left him tied for 6th place, five strokes behind eventual winner Phil Mickelson. Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history. His second round 61 matched his record score on <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes. This gave him a seven stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. Woods would never contend at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club and would come short of winning a major for the 5th full season, only contending in two of the four majors in 2013.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} widely known tour is <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour,</b> which tends to attract the strongest fields, outside the four Majors and the four World Golf Championships events. This is due mostly {{to the fact that}} most PGA Tour events have a first prize of at least 800,000 USD. The European Tour, which attracts a {{substantial}} number of top golfers from outside North America, ranks second to <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> in worldwide prestige. Some top professionals from outside North America play enough tournaments to maintain membership on both <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> and European Tour. Since 2010, both tours' money titles have been claimed by the same individual three times, with Luke Donald doing so in 2011 and Rory McIlroy in 2012 and 2014. In 2013, Henrik Stenson won the FedEx Cup points race on <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> and the European Tour money title, but did not top <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> money list (that honour going to Tiger Woods).|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{multiplicity}} of names, there is often confusion as to what <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> organization does and does not run. Of the events in <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> schedule, it does not run {{any of the four}} major championships (the Masters Tournament, the U.S. Open, The Open Championship and the PGA Championship), or the Ryder Cup. The PGA of America, not <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour,</b> runs the PGA Championship, the Senior PGA Championship, and co-organizes the Ryder Cup with Ryder Cup Europe, a company controlled by the PGA European Tour. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> is not involved with the women's golf tours in the U.S., which are mostly controlled by the LPGA. <b>The</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> is also not the governing body for the game of golf in the United States; this, instead, {{is the role of the}} United States Golf Association (USGA), which organizes the U.S. Open. What <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> does organize are the remaining 43 (in 2009) week-to-week events, including The Players Championship and the FedEx Cup events, as well as the biennial Presidents Cup. It also runs the main tournaments on five other tours: PGA Tour Champions, the Web.com Tour, PGA Tour Canada, PGA Tour China, and PGA Tour LatinoamÃ©rica.|$|E

25|$|There {{is also a}} PGA European Tour, {{which is}} {{separate}} from either <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> or the PGA of America; this organization runs a tour, mostly in Europe but with events throughout the world outside of North America, that {{is second only to}} <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour</b> in worldwide prestige. There are several other regional tours around the world. However, <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Tour,</b> European Tour, and many of the regional tours co-sponsor the World Golf Championships.
