50|$|A typical CDI module {{consists}} of a small transformer, a charging circuit, a triggering circuit and a main capacitor. First, the system voltage is raised up to 250 to 600 volts by a power supply inside the CDI module. Then, the electric current flows to <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> <b>circuit</b> and charges the capacitor. The rectifier inside <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> <b>circuit</b> prevents capacitor discharge before the moment of ignition. When the triggering circuit receives the triggering signal, the triggering circuit stops the operation of <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> <b>circuit,</b> allowing the capacitor to discharge its output rapidly to the low inductance ignition coil. In a CD ignition, the ignition coil acts as a pulse transformer rather than an energy storage medium {{as it does in}} an inductive system. The voltage output to the spark plugs is highly dependent on the design of the CD ignition. Voltages exceeding the insulation capabilities of existing ignition components can lead to early failure of those components. Most CD ignitions are made to give very high output voltages, but this is not always beneficial. When there's no triggering signal, <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> <b>circuit</b> is re-connected to charge the capacitor.|$|E

30|$|In Fig.  1, {{the switch}} (1) is an {{electronic}} SPST which controls the charging {{status of the}} lithium battery. It maintains the switch-off status as default, {{which means that the}} battery is not charged. If and only if the battery voltage is underneath the predefined level, the voltage comparator (1) triggers the switch (1) on, and the battery is charged at once if the solar panel could afford it. As soon as the charging starts for a few seconds, the battery voltage rises rapidly and changes the state of the comparator (1). That is why a RS trigger is required to keep the charging status.

The proposed approach is particularly {{suitable for the}} constant-current constant-voltage (CC-CV) charging method, {{which is the most}} commonly utilized one. Since the PRC is operated at two different frequencies for each CC and CV charging modes, this approach eliminates the need for complicated control techniques such as the frequency-control and phase-shift-control. The proposed method not only simplifies the design and implementation processes of the converter unit but also simplifies the design of output filter configuration and decreases the number of the required components for the control of <b>the</b> <b>charger.</b> <b>The</b> proposed method is confirmed by two experimental setups. The results show that <b>the</b> designed <b>charger</b> <b>circuit</b> ensured a very stable constant current in CC <b>charging</b> phase, where <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> current is fixed to 1.75 A.
