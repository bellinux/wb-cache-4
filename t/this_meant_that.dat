5|$|Athletes with a {{disability}} were then first included in exhibition events at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia, and, at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, they were included as full members of their national teams, making them the first fully inclusive international multi-sport games. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> results {{were included in the}} medal count.|$|E

5|$|Cardiff Blues {{had been}} the only team to finish the pool stage of the Heineken Cup unbeaten during the 2008–09 season, which saw them given top seeding for the quarter-finals. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> they would have a home quarter-final against the second-best runners-up from the pool stage, Toulouse. Cardiff won the quarter-final 9–6.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Government of Tasmania {{allocated}} $2million {{to erect}} a roof above 6,000terrace seats, in readiness for the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup; <b>this</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> {{almost all of the}} seating area was protected from the weather. In 2004, the ground became known as Aurora Stadium as the result of six-year naming rights sponsorship deal with Aurora Energy.|$|E
5|$|MLS clubs {{were first}} {{included}} in the U.S. Open Cup tournament in 1996. D.C. United won the tournament that year, and repeated their success in 2008. In 2009, the club began its title defense in the MLS qualification rounds. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> they had to win six games instead of the four needed to obtain the cup in 2008.|$|E

5|$|More {{efficient}} {{weapons would}} require less efficient initiators. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> less polonium would be required. At {{the time of}} Sandstone, the national stockpile of polonium-beryllium initiators consisted of 50 A-Class initiators, with more than 25 curies of polonium, and 13 B-Class initiators with 12 to 25 curies. During Sandstone, at least one test would be conducted with a B-Class initiator.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to {{the time}} bonus on the finish line, Kristoff was now in third place overall, just 11 seconds behind Terpstra. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Kristoff could win the overall victory in the race if {{he was able to}} win the final stage and take time bonuses at the {{intermediate}} sprints.|$|E
5|$|The 1865 decree for the revamp of {{secondary}} education brought about major developments for UST. It was tasked as a Bureau of Education with the Rector as its director. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> UST was {{to handle all}} matters pertaining to secondary education from the appointment of the school professors; the submission of grades, and {{the signing of the}} awarding of diplomas to the bachelor of arts graduates.|$|E
2500|$|<b>This</b> {{arrangement}} <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> {{once again}} the ogham alphabet was without a letter for the [...] sound, making necessary the creation of Peith (see below).|$|R

5|$|The 1992 Winter Olympics {{were the}} last Winter Games to be run before the {{introduction}} of more strenuous qualification standards. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> at the 1994 Winter Olympics, Senegal was unable to field a second skier, and Guèye {{would be limited to}} competing in a single event.|$|E
5|$|The FIDE rankings in January 2010 {{recorded}} Carlsen's rating at 2810, {{which made}} him No. 1 rated player in the world. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Carlsen became, {{at the age of}} 19 years and 32 days, the youngest ever world No. 1, as well as the first player from a Western nation to reach the top of the FIDE rankings since Bobby Fischer in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav {{emphasis}} on anti-aircraft defense meant that Split {{could only have}} a single funnel to allow the guns as much freedom to fire as possible, which dictated that the boiler rooms were adjacent to the engine room. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> a single torpedo hit in the machinery spaces could immobilize the ship.|$|E
5000|$|The {{result of}} <b>this</b> match <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the All Blacks took the 2010 Tri-Nations title with one match remaining, {{as well as}} the Freedom Cup.|$|R

5000|$|The season's home-and-away draw was {{extended}} from 18 to 20 rounds. <b>This</b> now <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> each team met {{nine of the}} other eleven teams twice in a season.|$|R
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> his pyramid {{was out of}} the {{alignment}} formed by the preceding ones, limited its size and constrained the layout of his mortuary complex. This would explain why, despite having enjoyed one of the longest reigns of the Fifth Dynasty, Nyuserre's pyramid was smaller than that of his father and closer in size to that of his grandfather Sahure.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> {{the fate}} of the Ashes would be {{determined}} by the final match at The Oval. Hassett warmed up with consecutive half-centuries against Surrey and Warwickshire. In the second innings of the latter match, he made 21 not out, holding the team together as Australia stumbled to 5/53 in pursuit of 166 for victory when time ran out.|$|E
5|$|After winning two Five Nations {{games in}} 1992, {{and one in}} 1993, Wales won the Championship in 1994 on points difference. But without {{defeating}} one of Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa, during the inter-World Cup period, Wales was not considered a major tournament contender. At the 1995 World Cup, after comprehensively beating Japan, Wales lost to New Zealand; <b>this</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> they needed to defeat Ireland {{to qualify for the}} quarter-finals. Wales lost 24–23 and so failed to progress beyond the pool stage for the second time, and later that year Kevin Bowring replaced Alex Evans to become Wales' first full-time coach.|$|E
50|$|In May 2006, B.A.T. ry {{published}} a press-release regarding producing a new Client Platform for BatMUD. <b>This</b> effectively <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> BatMUD shifted towards tackling {{the onslaught of}} the MMORPG.|$|R
50|$|The format {{employed}} for <b>this</b> tournament <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> players could still {{qualify for the}} quarter-finals even if they lost either of their first two matches. The format was thus.|$|R
5000|$|McIntyre's final {{development}} {{expanded the}} concept to an eight-team playoff. <b>This</b> expansion <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> no team received a [...] "second chance" [...] {{after the first}} week of the playoffs.|$|R
5|$|Although Hitler had {{terminated}} his Austrian {{citizenship in}} 1925, {{he did not}} acquire German citizenship for almost seven years. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> he was stateless, legally unable to run for public office, and still faced the risk of deportation. On 25 February 1932, the interior minister of Brunswick, Dietrich Klagges, {{who was a member}} of the NSDAP, appointed Hitler as administrator for the state's delegation to the Reichsrat in Berlin, making Hitler a citizen of Brunswick, and thus of Germany.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1960s, the power stations' {{operating}} hours were decreased due {{to the opening of}} the much larger Blyth power station in Northumberland. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> less ash was produced by the Stella and Dunston stations; so {{by the end of the}} 1960s, the CEGB sold Hexhamshire Lass and Bobby Shaftoe. The former went to a firm in Fareham, Hampshire, where it worked as a sand dredger until scrapped in 1993; the latter to a French dredging company.|$|E

Pieter de Kam was captaining the ship.|$|E
50|$|On 3 November 2014, the Araz-Naxçıvan {{announced}} their {{withdrawal from the}} league due constant biased referee decisions, which <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> all of their results were annulled. <b>This</b> also <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> no club will be relegated by end of the season.|$|R
25|$|Steven's {{defeat in}} <b>this</b> task <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> {{he had lost}} one task as Project Manager, making him the joint least {{successful}} Project Manager in this series, along with Sean and Alice.|$|R
5000|$|DNA {{cannot be}} totally {{prevented}} from undergoing somatic replication corruption; <b>this</b> has <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> cancer, {{which is caused}} by somatic mutations, has not (so far) been completely eliminated by natural selection.|$|R
