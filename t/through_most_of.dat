5|$|One of Edward's {{persistent}} challenges <b>through</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{his reign}} was {{a shortage of}} money; of the debts he inherited from his father, around £60,000 was still owing in the 1320s. The King {{worked his way through}} many treasurers and other financial officials, few of whom stayed long, raising revenues through often unpopular taxes, and requisitioning goods using his right of prise. He also took out many loans, first through the Frescobaldi family, and then through his banker Antonio Pessagno. Edward took a strong interest in financial matters towards the end of his reign, distrusting his own officials and attempting to increase revenues directly by cutting back on the expenses of his own household.|$|E

At a public meeting held in October 1920, users complained about the poor service and the lack of trucks to carry goods. The chairman of the Isle of Axholme Rural District Council was particularly exasperated {{by the fact that the}} trains arrived at Haxey Junction shortly after the trains on the other line had departed.|$|E
5|$|Pierce fully {{expected}} to be renominated by the Democrats. In reality his chances of winning the nomination were slim, let alone re-election.

Nevertheless, his supporters began to plan for an alliance with Douglas to deny James Buchanan the nomination. Buchanan had solid political connections and had been safely overseas <b>through</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Pierce's term, leaving him untainted by the Kansas debacle.|$|E
