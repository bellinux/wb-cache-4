40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} elastic lateral {{buckling}} of simply <b>supported</b> <b>tee</b> beams under moment gradient. Solutions are obtained via the energy approach, assuming a general Fourier sine {{series for the}} buckled shapes. It is found that buckling capacity of tee beams is greatly influenced by {{the inability of the}} web to resist compressive bending stresses. Although uniform moment is the most severe loading condition for inverted tee beams, this is not true in the case of tee beams. This study shows that a high moment gradient is generally a more critical form of loading for tee beams. Formula for the buckling moment modification factor for doubly symmetric I-beams found in design specifications and standard texts could be unsafe when applied to tee beams...|$|R

40|$|Background—In {{patients}} with acute pulmonary embolism, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) often reveals presumably thrombotic lesions within the central pulmonary arteries (CPAs). These CPA lesions, when found in {{patients with}} primary pulmonary hypertension, {{have been attributed to}} in situ thrombosis or atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that similar CPA lesions may also develop {{in patients with}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the absence of pulmonary embolism. Methods and Results—We examined by TEE 25 patients with COPD and 27 control patients with left heart disease. None of the patients had previous pulmonary embolism or ileofemoral and popliteal vein thrombosis. By use of TEE, CPA lesions were found in 12 COPD patients (48 %) and 2 control patients (7. 4 %) (P, 0. 01). When CPA lesions were subdivided into types 1 (protruding and mobile) and 2 (wall-adherent), type 1 lesions proved to be uncommon, being found within the pulmonary trunk in 12 % and 3. 7 % of COPD and control patients, respectively (P 5 NS). Conversely, type 2 lesions, which were always localized in the right pulmonary artery, were frequent in COPD patients (36 %) and rare in control patients (3. 7 %) (P, 0. 01). When available, helical CT and MR angiography confirmed <b>TEE</b> findings, <b>supporting</b> an atherosclerotic origin of type 2 lesions, which were different from typical thrombotic lesions. FEV 1 /FVC ratio, RV/TLC ratio, PaO 2, hematocrit value, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure were not significantly different in COPD patients with and without CPA lesions. At TEE, however, COPD patients with CPA lesions showed a larger size of the main and right pulmonary arteries...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of an}} {{international}} major research initiative, dealing with the behaviour of long span cellular beams in steel framed buildings under fire, a large-scale fire test incorporating 15 m long cellular beams was carried out. The test incorporated unprotected secondary cellular steel beams acting compositely with the supporting floor slab. The floorplate in its entirety was designed {{to carry the load}} with unprotected beams, when subjected to a severe fire, by utilising membrane action of the floor slab. The overall structure performed very well supporting the full applied static load {{for the duration of the}} test. The unprotected cellular steel beams were subjected to distortional buckling, with only the top <b>tee</b> providing any <b>support</b> through catanary action. The test supported the assumptions adopted in the structural design approach and provided an accurate estimate of the strength of the floorplate. Comparison of the recorded time-temperature relationship of the fire with the design method presented in the Eurocodes shows that the code under-predicts the severity of the fire, although this was compensated to some extent by the conservative assumptions embedded within the structural model.

40|$|Context: Use of {{perioperative}} {{transesophageal echocardiography}} (TEE) has expanded in India. Despite attempts to standardize {{the practice of}} TEE in cardiac surgical procedures, variation in practice and application exists. This is the first online survey by Indian College of Cardiac Anaesthesia, research and academic wing of the Indian Association of Cardiovascular Thoracic Anaesthesiologists (IACTA). Aims: We hypothesized that variations in practice of intraoperative TEE exist among centers and this survey aimed at analyzing them. Settings and Design: This is an online survey conducted {{among members of the}} IACTA. Subjects and Methods: All members of IACTA were contacted using online questionnaire fielded using SurveyMonkey™ software. There were 21 questions over four pages evaluating infrastructure, documentation of TEE, experience and accreditation of anesthesiologist performing TEE, and finally impact of TEE on clinical practice. Questions were also asked about national TEE workshop conducted by the IACTA, and suggestions were invited by members on overseas training. Results: Response rate was 29. 7 % (382 / 1222). 53. 9 % were from high-volume centers (> 500 cases annually). TEE machine/probe was available to 75. 9 % of the respondents and those in high-volume centers had easier (86. 9 %) access. There was poor documentation of preoperative consent (23. 3 %) as well as TEE findings (66 %). Only 18. 2 % of responders were board qualified. Almost 90 % of the responders felt surgeons respected their TEE diagnosis. Around half of the responders felt that new intraoperative findings by TEE were considered in decision-making in most of the cases and 70 % of the responders reported that surgical plan was altered based on TEE finding more than 10 times in the last year. Despite this, only 5 % of the responders in this survey were monetarily awarded for performing impactful skill of TEE. Majority (57 %) felt that {{there is no need for}} overseas training for Indian cardiac anesthesiologists. Conclusions: In this survey of members of the IACTA, use of TEE has increased substantially, but still a lot of variations in practice patterns exist in India. There is urgent need for improving TEE certification and upgrade documentation standards, motivate use of TTE across all centers, promote awareness and usefulness of TEE use among surgical fraternity, monitor impact of <b>TEE,</b> and <b>support</b> separate remuneration policy in India...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{experiments}} and finite element simulations on the structural response of piping systems to internal detonation loading. Specifically, the work described in this paper focuses on the forces that are produced at tee-junctions that lead to axial and bending structural responses of the piping system. Detonation experiments were conducted in a 2 -in. (50 mm) diameter schedule 40 piping system that was fabricated using 304 stainless steel and welded to ASME B 31. 3 standards. The 4. 1 m (162 -in.) long piping system included one <b>tee</b> and was <b>supported</b> using custom brackets and cantilever beams fastened to steel plates that were bolted to the laboratory walls. Nearly-ideal detonations were used in a 30 / 70 H 2 -N 2 O mixture at 1 atm initial pressure and 300 K. Pressure and hoop, axial, and support strains were measured using a high-speed (1 MHz) digital data acquisition system and calibrated signal conditioners. It was concluded that detonations propagate through the run of a 90 ° tee with relatively little disturbance in either direction. The detonation load increases by approximately a factor of 2 when the detonation enters through the branch. The deflections of the cantilever beam supports and the hoop and axial pipe strains could be adequately predicted by finite element simulations. The support loads are adequately predicted {{as long as the}} supports are constrained to the piping. This paper shows that with relatively simple models, quantitative predictions of tee forces can be made for the purposes of design or safety analysis of piping systems subject to internal detonations...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveChoice of {{cannulation}} site (femoral, axillary) for cardiopulmonary bypass for thoracic aortic {{surgery is}} controversial. We review a single-center consecutive experience with femoral cannulation {{in the era}} of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). MethodsFemoral artery cannulation is our preference for both aneurysms and dissections. If intraoperative TEE (or preoperative computed tomography) shows mobile atheroma, we avoid femoral cannulation and use the right axillary artery. Charts were reviewed to detect any cannulation- or perfusion-related complications. ResultsEight hundred eighty patients underwent cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass for thoracic aortic surgery: 767 femoral (87 %) and 113 other (13 %, 87 aortic, 22 axillary, 4 innominate). Among the femoral cases, 673 (87. 7 %) were elective and 94 (12. 2 %) urgent or emergency. Hospital survival was 723 of 767 (94 %) : 654 of 673 (97 %) for elective cases and 69 of 94 (73 %) for urgent or emergency cases. Survivals were 549 of 572 (95 %) for ascending and arch, 91 of 97 (93 %) for descending, and 83 of 98 (84 %) for thoracoabdominal. Stroke (fixed neurologic deficit) occurred in 14 of 767 cases (1. 8 %) : 9 ascending or arch and 5 descending or thoracoabdominal. There were 5 paraplegias in the descending or thoracoabdominal group. There was 1 instance of intraoperative descending dissection (well tolerated), no arterial ruptures, and 6 instances (0. 7 %) of local femoral arterial narrowing requiring surgical correction (patch graft). One patient (0. 1 %) had postoperative ischemia of the cannulated limb, and 25 patients (3. 2 %) had local wound problems (infection 21, seroma 4) treated conservatively. ConclusionsThis large experience in the <b>TEE</b> era strongly <b>supports</b> femoral cannulation for aortic surgery, with good survival, low stroke rate, minimal perfusion-related rupture or dissection, and minimal limb ischemia. If intraoperative TEE shows mobile atheroma, axillary cannulation is preferred...|$|R
