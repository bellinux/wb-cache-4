The resulting image can be detected directly by the eye, imaged on a photographic plate, or captured digitally. The single lens with its attachments, or the system of lenses and imaging equipment, along with the appropriate lighting equipment, sample stage, and support, makes up the basic light microscope. The most recent development is the digital microscope, which uses a CCD camera {{to focus on the}} exhibit of interest. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> on a computer screen, so eye-pieces are unnecessary.|$|E

The wounds and crown of thorns allude to the manner of Jesus' death, while the fire represents the transformative power of divine love.|$|E

5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{contrast sensitivity}} describes {{the ability of}} the visual system to distinguish bright and dim components of a static image. Visual acuity can be defined as the angle with which one can resolve two points as being separate, given that <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> with 100% contrast and is projected onto the fovea of the retina. [...] Thus, when an optometrist or ophthalmologist assesses a patient’s visual acuity using a Snellen chart or some other acuity chart, the target image is displayed at high contrast, e.g., black letters of decreasing size on a white background. A subsequent contrast sensitivity exam may demonstrate difficulty with decreased contrast (using, e.g., the Pelli-Robson chart, which consists of uniform-sized but increasingly pale grey letters on a white background).|$|E
50|$|The {{charge-coupled}} devices (CCDs) in the WFPC2 (designed at JPL {{and manufactured}} by Loral) detected electromagnetic radiation {{in a range}} from 120 nm to 1000 nm. This included the 380 nm to 780 nm of the visible spectrum, all of the near ultraviolet (and {{a small part of}} the extreme ultraviolet band) and most of the near infrared band. The sensitivity distribution of these CCDs is roughly normal, with a peak around 700 nm and concomitantly very poor sensitivity at the extremes of the CCDs' operating range. WFPC2 featured four identical CCD detectors, each 800x800 pixels. Three of these, arranged in an L-formation, comprise Hubble's Wide Field Camera (WFC). Adjacent to them is the Planetary Camera (PC), a fourth CCD with different (narrower-focused) optics. This afforded a more detailed view over a smaller region of the visual field. WFC and PC images are typically combined, producing the WFPC2's characteristic stairstep image. When distributed as non-scientific JPEG files the PC portion of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> with the same resolution as the WFC portions, but astronomers receive a raw scientific image package which presents the PC image in its native, higher detail.|$|E

30|$|The HNT {{is a kind}} of layered aluminosilicate, {{associated}} with the chemical properties of halloysite tubule’s outermost surface with the properties of SiO 2 and properties of the inner cylinder core with Al 2 O 3. So the HNTs templates could be etched with HCl/HF solution. Furthermore, the two acids cannot dissolve the polyaniline coatings.

However, the image shows some agglomeration of Pt and Ru nanoparticles. To see the distribution of Pt and Ru, the mapping is shown in Fig.  10 b for Pt and Fig.  10 c for Ru. The results of the mapping illustrated that both metals were uniformly dispersed on the nanofiber; however, some agglomeration occurred for Pt due to an error during the deposition process. The agglomeration of nanoparticles was a reaction result because of overusing the NaOH solution during the pH adjustment for the deposition process [24].|$|E

50|$|It {{was during}} this period that many design houses began to hire artists to sketch or paint designs for garments. <b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>were</b> <b>shown</b> to clients, which was much cheaper than {{producing}} an actual sample garment in the workroom.
