5|$|On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium {{under the}} {{operational}} plan Fall Gelb (Case Yellow). The Allied armies attempted {{to halt the}} German Army in Belgium, believing {{it to be the}} main German thrust. After the French had fully committed the best of the Allied armies to Belgium between 10 and 12 May, the Germans enacted the second phase of their operation, a break-through, or sickle cut, through the Ardennes, and advanced toward the English Channel. The German Army (Heer) reached the Channel after five days, encircling the Allied armies. The Germans gradually reduced <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> Allied forces, forcing them back to the sea. The Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May 1940, ending the battle.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> La Rochelle ("Poche de La Rochelle"), {{one of the}} Atlantic pockets, was a zone {{extending}} to {{a distance of about}} 10 kilometers around La Rochelle, reinforced by an anti-tank trench. After the allied landing in Normandy in June 1944, a large number of German troops had regrouped in the area.|$|E
25|$|After {{the police}} arrive, Archie notices that an object has been stashed in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> his topcoat.

Back at Wolfe's house, {{the object is}} found to be a bloodstained fencing glove, in which a col de mort has been wrapped. A col de mort, it turns out, is a sharp metal fitting that can be attached to the end of an épée, so as to turn a relatively safe weapon into a deadly one.|$|E

25|$|The allied {{siege of}} <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> La Rochelle lasted from September 1944 to May 1945, without heavy bombardment. La Rochelle {{remained}} in German hands {{until the end}} of the war, much as other Atlantic harbours such as Brest, Saint-Nazaire, Lorient, Gironde-Nord, Gironde-Sud because the main thrust of the war was more concerned with focusing on Germany itself. Just surrounding the city was considered wiser than conducting a frontal attack, as the city would ultimately fall anyway with the end of the war. The German command also wished to keep control of the coastal garrisons and rejected evacuation in order to maintain a threat on Allied shipping in the Atlantic.|$|E

He is given the video camera which he placed in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> his tweed jacket. He is shocked when he hears the footage and becomes desperate {{to head back to}} the Vatican. The video shows the camerlengo branding himself with the Illuminati diamond and confessing that he himself is Janus, and who set in motion the night's chain of events in order to sabotage the Vatican. He also confesses that he killed the Pope with an overdose of heparin, a powerful anticoagulant because the Pope revealed he had fathered a child.|$|E

25|$|Wooden cages made of tiny {{rods and}} planks were once {{the most common}} type of insect house. The people of Shanghai and Hangzhou areas still use stool-shaped cages for keeping captive grasshoppers. Elsewhere, cages were {{historically}} used for keeping captive cicadas. They were suspended outdoors, at the eaves of the houses and from tree branches. Their use declined when the Chinese concentrated on keeping crickets. Small cages are still used for transporting crickets. Some are curved to follow the shape of a human body; crickets need warmth and prefer to be kept close to the body. The cage is placed in a tao, a kind of protective silk bag, and is ideally carried in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> a shirt. A special type of funnel-shaped wire mesh cage is used to temporarily contain the cricket while its main home is being cleaned.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his protective equipment, a catcher usually also adopts practices that minimize his risk of injury. For instance, unlike fielders elsewhere on the field, a catcher tries, to the extent possible, to catch the ball with his gloved hand alone. An outfielder may catch a fly ball by covering the ball, once it strikes <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> his glove, with his bare hand {{in order to secure}} it. The catcher, however, tries to keep his bare hand, which is highly vulnerable to injury, out of harm's way by presenting the pitcher with a target (the large round glove) while hiding his unprotected throwing hand behind his back. By doing so, the bare hand cannot be struck by a foul tip. Many broken fingers, split fingernails, and grotesque dislocations are avoided by adherence to this simple expedient.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Stoltenberg {{went into}} more detail {{about how she}} {{started out as a}} drug addict, to TV {{journalist}} Tonje Steinsland–the second time her life as an addict {{was the subject of a}} television special. It started in 1991, when she was 27. She witnessed two drug addicts in a fight in a cafe in Oslo when something fell out of <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> one of them. She picked it up and saw that it was heroin. Together with her boyfriend she went home and decided to snort the drug. For the next three years she was an intravenous drug user. By the end of the 1990s, she was close to dying. In the interview, Stoltenberg also tells of a boyfriend who subjected her to punishments, psychological terror and much fear, however, the heroin turned all of that into a feeling of freedom and made her perceive their relationship as simply wonderful, for a while.|$|E

25|$|On 6 July, it was {{reported}} widely that the Cambridge store of Boots and also the Edinburgh Woolen Mill in {{the centre of the}} city had caught on fire. The Boots branch burnt for four hours completely destroying the building and the wool clothing store was badly damaged with the entire stock ruined. Two more devices were then found, both leather shops, one of which was in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> a sheepskin coat. The ARM claimed all four devices, causing Cambridge city centre to be cordoned off whilst officers searched for two more devices that the cell claimed would explode the following day at 12pm. After an extensive search, it was concluded that the additional two devices claimed were a hoax, with no further devices exploding the following day. A month later, another leather shop was destroyed and the same wool mill suffered minor damage after devices went off, with two more recovered in leather shops and one in a fur shop.|$|E
25|$|Hutchinson {{made another}} {{movement}} on the 21st and invested the town of Giza with the Anglo Ottoman force encamped close to the French advanced works {{on the other side}} of the river. By this time the force besieging Cairo had swelled to 20,000 men. An important letter had been found in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> a French General named Roiz who was killed in the action on the 21st written by Menou expressing an apprehension that the British would cut the embankment which formed the canal of Alexandria and thereby to let the waters of the sea into Lake Mariout cutting off any chance of escape for the French. This was subsequently done by the engineers and water rushed in flooding the area and making the canal unusable and making the French with no escape route whatsoever. Some slight skirmishing took place in the evening on both banks of the Nile wherein the Mamelukes forced back a French sortie. On the 22nd preparations were made to besiege Cairo and its different forts by the allied forces.|$|E
25|$|With the Bolshevik victory, Swenson {{found not}} just two schooners but his entire Siberian {{business}} and stock impounded and a warrant {{out for his}} arrest. The issues besides alcohol (if that was really an issue) were taxes and his perceived close association with the Whites. He briefly discusses allegations of selling guns to the Whites, suggesting they were inflated, and attributes some allegations to disgruntled competitors. (Hunting arms and ammunition were {{a regular part of}} his business.) He does not mention an allegation of a check for $500,000 found in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> an executed White officer. Swenson reports he declined an offer from a former White officer to raid the coast and recover the furs by force. Instead he and R.S. Pollister (Vice President of Olaf Swenson & Co.) went to China to obtain a Soviet visa and began a long slow process of negotiation to release the furs, trading stock, and books. The ultimate resolution was a contract entered in 1925 to deliver goods in Siberia to Moscow's specification on a cost-plus basis and export furs. This contract was renewed for five years in 1926 and expanded in 1928 after negotiations {{with the head of the}} Soviet fur trust in London. Other associates in this venture were Maurice Cantor and Irving W. Herskovits of New York. In this period, the business name often appears as Swenson Trading Company or Swenson Fur Trading Company. Local trade was handled by a Soviet government trading organization which specified the goods and set fur prices. Swenson reports prices paid to the trappers were reduced in this period and the range of trade goods narrowed to necessities.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics to}} the song chronicle a long-distance relationship. It {{contains}} detailed imagery such as the protagonist remembering his girlfriend kissing him [...] "under the lamppost, back on 6th street", and keeping {{a picture of him}} [...] "in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> [...] ripped jeans". These lyrics were inspired by Sheeran's own experience on a long-distance relationship. He dated Nina Nesbitt, a Scottish singer/songwriter, for more than a year. While on this relationship, Sheeran spent five months away from Nesbitt: three months while on a concert tour with Snow Patrol and further two months on his own tour. At his concert in Kansas City on June 29, 2017, Sheeran noted that he wrote the song Photograph at Kansas City's Intercontinental Hotel during a previous tour.|$|E
500|$|A three-page {{letter was}} found in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> his jacket. The letter was never officially made public, but was leaked in November 1990 to Francine Pelletier, and {{published}} in the newspaper La Presse. In his suicide letter, Lépine claimed political motives, blaming feminists for ruining his life. He considered himself rational and expressed admiration for Denis Lortie, who had mounted {{an attack on the}} Quebec National Assembly in 1984 for political reasons, killing three Quebec government employees. The letter also contained a list of nineteen Quebec women whom Lépine apparently wished to kill because of their feminism. [...] Another letter, written to a friend, promised the explanation to the massacre lay by following clues left in Lépine's apartment. The hunt led only to a suitcase of computer games and hardware.|$|E
500|$|Most male crickets make a loud {{chirping}} sound by stridulation. The stridulatory organ {{is located}} on the tegmen, or fore wing, which is leathery in texture. A large vein runs along the centre of each tegmen, with comb-like serrations on its edge forming a file-like structure, and at the rear edge of the tegmen is a scraper. The tegmina are held at an angle to the body and rhythmically raised and lowered which causes the scraper on one wing to rasp on the file on the other. The central part of the tegmen contains the [...] "harp", an area of thick, sclerotinized membrane which resonates and amplifies the volume of sound, as does <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> air between the tegmina and the body wall. Most female crickets lack the necessary adaptations to stridulate, so make no sound.|$|E
