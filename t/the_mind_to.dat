5|$|The New Thought movement, {{which emerged}} in the 1880s, was {{responsible}} for popularizing belief {{in the power of}} <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> achieve prosperity. While initially focused on achieving mental and physical health, New Thought teachers such as Charles Fillmore made material success a major emphasis of the movement. By the 20th century, New Thought concepts had saturated American popular culture, being common features of both self-help literature and popular psychology.|$|E

Original Stories begins with a frame story that sketches out the education of two young girls by their maternal teacher Mrs. Mason, followed {{by a series of}} didactic tales. The book was first published by Joseph Johnson in 1788; a second, illustrated edition, with engravings by William Blake, was released in 1791 and remained in print for around a quarter of a century.|$|E

50|$|In the Chabad presentation, every {{intellectual}} process must incorporate three faculties: Chochma, Binah, and Daat. Chochma (lit. wisdom) is <b>the</b> <b>mind's</b> ability <b>to</b> {{come up with}} a {{new insight}} into a concept that one did not know before. Binah (lit. understanding) is <b>the</b> <b>mind's</b> ability <b>to</b> take a new insight (from Chochma), analyze all of its implications and simplify the concept so it is understood well. Daat (lit. knowledge), the third stage, is <b>the</b> <b>mind's</b> ability <b>to</b> focus and hold its attention on the Chochma and the Binah.|$|R

25|$|Simple hedonism is {{the view}} that {{physical}} pleasure is the ultimate good. However, the ancient philosopher Epicurus used the word 'pleasure' in {{a more general sense}} that encompassed a range of states from bliss to contentment to relief. Contrary to popular caricature, he valued pleasures of <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> bodily pleasures, and advocated moderation as the surest path to happiness.|$|E
25|$|Will Wright {{has also}} stated that The Sims was {{actually}} meant as a satire of U.S. consumer culture.

50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> begins <b>to</b> fray or {{is lost in}} shadows, a {{sharp pain}} slices through the skull.

25|$|The {{practice}} of Svadhyaya as a Niyama is perfected in many forms. One form of Svadhyaya is mantra meditation, where certain sound constructs pregnant with meaning are recited, anchoring <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> one thought. This practice helps draw the mind away from outward-going tendencies, silencing the crowding of thoughts, and ultimately towards inward feeling of resonance. It can alternately be any music, sermon, chant, inspirational book that absorbs {{the person to}} a state of absorption, trance, unifying oneness.|$|E
25|$|Sbyong ba is {{a variety}} of teachings for {{training}} (sbyong ba) the body, speech and mind. The training of the body entails instructions for physical posture. The training of speech mainly entails recitation, especially of the syllable hūm. The training of the mind is a Madhyamaka-like analysis {{of the concept of}} <b>the</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>to</b> make clear that mind cannot arise from anywhere, reside anywhere,or go anywhere. They are in effect an establishment of emptiness by means of the intellect.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} book Schleiermacher gave {{religion}} an unchanging place among the divine mysteries of human nature, distinguished it from what he regarded as current caricatures of religion, and described the perennial forms of its manifestation. This established the programme of his subsequent theological system. In the Monologen he revealed his ethical manifesto, in which he proclaimed his ideas on the freedom and independence of the spirit, and {{on the relationship of}} <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> the sensual world, and sketched his ideal of the future of the individual and of society.|$|E

25|$|However, {{cognitive}} science and psychology {{do not require}} <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> be irreducible, and operate {{on the assumption that}} it has physical basis. In fact, it is common in science to presuppose a complex system; while fields such as chemistry, biology, or geology could be verbosely expressed in terms of quantum field theory, it is convenient to use levels of abstraction like molecules, cells, or the mantle. It is often difficult to decompose these levels without heavy analysis and computation. Sober has also advanced philosophical arguments against the notion of irreducibility.|$|E
25|$|Information {{visualization}} {{focused on}} the creation of approaches for conveying abstract information in intuitive ways. Visual representations and interaction techniques take advantage of the human eye’s broad bandwidth pathway into <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> allow users to see, explore, and understand large amounts of information at once. The key difference between scientific visualization and information visualization is that information visualization is often applied to data that is not generated by scientific inquiry. Some examples are graphical representations of data for business, government, news and social media.|$|E
25|$|One open {{question}} regarding {{the nature of}} the mind is the mind–body problem, which investigates the relation of <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> the physical brain and nervous system. Pre-scientific viewpoints included dualism and idealism, which considered the mind somehow non-physical. Modern views center around physicalism and functionalism, which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity. Another question concerns which types of beings are capable of having minds. For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all animals, by all living things, whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of human-made machines.|$|E

25|$|They land on Schar's World {{and search}} for the Mind in the Command System, a complex of {{subterranean}} train stations. They soon discover that the Mind is being hunted {{by a pair of}} Idiran soldiers who have killed all the Changers stationed on the planet, and who regard Horza and his crew as enemies, having no knowledge of the Changers' alliance with the Idirans. Horza has kept Balveda alive, and she is taken into the complex. The CATs crew encounter the Idirans in one of the Command System stations, and after a firefight apparently kill one and capture the other. After tracking <b>the</b> <b>Mind</b> <b>to</b> another station, the drone Unaha-Closp discovers it hiding in the reactor car of a Command System train. The second Idiran, who had been mortally wounded but not killed, sets one of the trains for a collision course to the station. The captured Idiran, Xoxarle, frees himself and in the ensuing impact and firefight the remaining members of the Clear Air Turbulence are killed. Horza pursues Xoxarle and is fatally injured, but the Idiran is killed by Unaha-Closp and Balveda.|$|E

500|$|Philosophy of mind [...] is {{a branch}} of {{philosophy}} that studies {{the nature of the}} mind. The mind–body problem is a paradigm issue in philosophy of mind, although other issues are addressed, such as the hard problem of consciousness, and the nature of particular mental states.
