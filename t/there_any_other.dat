25|$|Diagnosis of post-polio {{syndrome}} can be difficult, since {{the symptoms are}} hard to separate from complications due to the original poliomyelitis infection, and from the normal infirmities of aging. There is no laboratory test for {{post-polio syndrome}}, nor are <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> specific diagnostic criteria. Three important criteria are recognized, including: previous diagnosis of polio, long interval after recovery and the gradual onset of weakness.|$|E
25|$|Censure is {{the public}} reprimanding of a public {{official}} for inappropriate conduct or voting behavior. When the president is censured, it serves only as a condemnation and has no direct effect on the validity of presidency, nor are <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> particular legal consequences. Unlike impeachment, censure has no basis in the Constitution or in {{the rules of the}} Senate and House of Representatives. It derives from the formal condemnation of either congressional body of their own members.|$|E

Paul Clinton {{wrote that}} Azaria was [...] "brilliant as the tortured (is <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> kind) artist Blitzstein." [...] The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon {{in the television}} film Tuesdays with Morrie, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the [...] "best work [...] done." [...] These {{were two of the}} first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: [...] "all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was so happy to get what I got. And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's time to get a dramatic role.'" [...] His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. [...] "I know [...] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in , and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why." [...] His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be [...] "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" [...] material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film [...] "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s and prior to {{long-term}} dialysis becoming available, Keith Reemtsma {{and his colleagues}} at Tulane University in New Orleans attempted transplants of chimpanzee kidneys into 13 human patients. [...] Most of these patients only lived one to two months. [...] However in 1964, a 23-year-old woman lived for nine months and even returned to her job as a school teacher until she suddenly collapsed and died. [...] It was assumed that she died from an acute electrolyte disturbance. [...] At autopsy, the kidneys had not been rejected nor was <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> obvious cause of death. One source states this patient died from pneumonia. [...] Tom Starzl and his team in Colorado used baboon kidneys with six human patients who lived one or two months, but with no longer term survivors. [...] Others in the United States and France had limited experiences.|$|E
2500|$|The {{popularity}} of Just Sniffing Around brought requests for a companion poem for cat lovers. In response, Brodsky wrote Purrsnikkity, {{and held a}} contest to find a cat {{to be the main}} character. For every three pictures they submitted of their cat, children were encouraged to donate $5 to a local rescue shelter. The winning cat was selected by illustrator Cameron Bennett to be the model for the illustrations in the book. The Midwest Book Review writes, [...] "Told from the cat's point of view (is <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>other?),</b> Pursnikitty presents many recurring themes in tales of pet care and responsible pet ownership." [...] Reviewer Steve McEvoy writes, [...] "this book captures the essence and spirit of a cat and the cat's relationship to the family and the environment it lives in." [...] Brodsky said in a 2010 interview about the book, [...] "the book's messages deal with family interaction and tolerance," [...] noting [...] "how important it is to look beyond first impressions." ...|$|E
