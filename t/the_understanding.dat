5|$|The {{government}} began purchasing church run boarding {{schools in the}} 1920s. During this period capital {{costs associated with the}} schools were assumed by the government, leaving administrative and instructional duties to church officials. The hope was that minimizing facility expenditures would allow church administrators to provide higher quality instruction and support to the students in their care. Although the government was willing to, and did, purchase schools from the churches, many were acquired for free given that the rampant disrepair present in the buildings resulted in their having no economic value. Schools continued to be maintained by churches in instances where they failed to reach an agreement with government officials with <b>the</b> <b>understanding</b> that the government would provide support for capital costs. <b>The</b> <b>understanding</b> ultimately proved complicated {{due to the lack of}} written agreements outlining the extent and nature of that support or the approvals required to undertake expensive renovations and repairs.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore what {{understandings}} of disability {{are evident in the}} literature used at Bachelor programs in Occupational Therapy in Norway. A therapist’s understanding of disability can be assumed to affect how they work, consequently affecting disabled people as their clients. This, coupled with financial saving measures in the healthcare sector (such as utilising different professionals according to their expertise) makes it relevant to know what understanding of disability is present within a profession. Two research questions have been formulated to explore <b>the</b> <b>understandings</b> in <b>the</b> literature: How is disability represented in occupational therapy literature used at Bachelor programs in Occupational Therapy in Norway? and Which is the dominant discourse concerning disability conveyed through course literature at Bachelor programs in Occupational Therapy in Norway? This thesis is a literature study and the method used to explore the subject is Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis. Literature lists were collected from the five schools that offer Bachelor programs in occupational therapy in Norway. The most frequently used literature/chapters at all schools are included in <b>the</b> study. Two <b>understandings</b> of disability were found in the texts; a traditional OT (occupational therapy) understanding and an understanding based on ICF. Three discourses were found, the medical, relational and individual, which all explain different aspects of <b>the</b> <b>understandings.</b> Within <b>the</b> traditional OT <b>understanding,</b> disability is understood as a problem, defined by the individual, with performing an activity or participating. It is caused by or in the interaction between the activity, the environment and the person. Within <b>the</b> ICF <b>understanding</b> disability is understood as resulting from the relationship between a person’s possible impairment and their level of activity and participation. Disability is positively or negatively affected by the person’s health, the environment and personal factors. <b>The</b> traditional OT <b>understanding</b> is stronger within the analysed literature. <b>The</b> <b>understandings</b> cannot replace one another, and with support from other research, the conclusion is drawn that <b>the</b> <b>understandings</b> should complement and learn from each other while they continue to develop. </p...|$|R

5|$|Ethology is {{the study}} of animal {{behavior}} (particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and <b>the</b> <b>understanding</b> of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, influenced many ethologists to come.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{an online}} {{discussion}} is certainly collaborative, mass collaboration differs {{from a large}} forum, email list, bulletin board, chat session or group discussion in that the discussion's structure of separate, individual posts generated through turn-taking communication means the textual content does not {{take the form of}} a single, coherent body. Of course the conceptual domain of the overall discussion exists as a single unified body, however the textual contributors can be linked back to <b>the</b> <b>understandings</b> and interpretations of a single author. Though <b>the</b> author's <b>understandings</b> and interpretations are most certainly a negotiation of <b>the</b> <b>understandings</b> of all who read and contribute to the discussion, the fact that there was only one author of a given entry reduces the entry's collaborative complexity to the discursive/interpretive as opposed to constructive/‘negotiative’ levels ...|$|R
