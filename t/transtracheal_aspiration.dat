40|$|A {{retrospective}} analysis of 193 renal transplant recipients yielded 15 patients who developed pulmonary mycosis posttransplantation and one {{case in which}} mycotic lung infection existed {{at the time of}} transplant surgery. Agent responsible for infection included Nocardia asteroides in 8 cases, Asperigillus flavus in 5 cases, Cryptococcus neoformans in 4 patients and Candida albicans in 2 cases. Two cases had mixed mycotic infections. Ten patients died, of which 7 had diagnosis established antemortem. Two cases had diagnosis established by thoracotomy and 1 case by <b>transtracheal</b> <b>aspiration.</b> Problems in establishing accurate diagnosis are discussed with emphasis placed on the need for more frequent use of <b>transtracheal</b> <b>aspiration</b> and thoracotomy for precise diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|Summary: <b>Transtracheal</b> <b>aspirations</b> were cultured in 120 sputum {{positive}} (on smear ex-amination) {{patients of}} pulmonary tuberculosis. Concomitant non-tuberculous bacterial in-fection (aerobic and anaerobic) {{was found in}} 61. 67 %. Out of these, pure anaerobic growth was obtained in 14. 86 % and a mixed growth (anaerobic + aerobic) was noted in 12. 16 %. Predominant anaerobic isolate was bacteroides melaninogenicus (30 %). All anaerobic bac-terial isolates except bacteroides fragilis {{were found to be}} most sensitive to penicillin. However, metronidazole was found to be effective against most anaerobic isolates and gentamycin was ineffective against most anaerobic organisms. Patients having mucopurulent, purulent and foul smelling sputum yielded statistically higher percentage of anaerobes. Yield of anaerobes was higher in patients having far advanced and fibrocavitary tuberculosis...|$|R
40|$|Branhamella catarrhalis was {{suggested}} {{by the presence of}} gram-negative intracellular diplococci and confirmed by quantitative culture of the expectorated sputa of 11 patients with clinical evidence of lower respiratory tract infection. In quantitative culture, more than 20 colonies of B. catarrhalis were seen in each of the liquefied expectorated sputa at a dilution of 10 (- 7). <b>Transtracheal</b> <b>aspirations</b> were then performed on these 11 patients, and B. catarrhalis was isolated from the lower respiratory tract secretions of 10 of the patients. Of the 10 isolates, 5 produced beta-lactamase. None of the isolates grew on modified Thayer-Martin medium. The presence of gram-negative intracellular diplococci and the growth of B. catarrhalis on quantitative culture of expectorated sputum reliably indicates the presence of B. catarrhalis in the lower respiratory tract...|$|R

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of 10, 10 methylene blue (MB) and squamous epithelial cells as oropharyngeal markers in <b>transtracheal</b> <b>aspiration</b> was prospectively evaluated.

In specimens of transtracheal aspirate obtained from 10 bronchitic patients, quantitative bacteriology ruled out even minute contamination in nine. Cytologic-morphometric examination revealed that 700, 10 of both sterile and colon-ized specimens of transtracheal aspirate contained squamous epithelial cells that were indistinguishable, except by electron microscopy, from buccal mucosal cells.

40|$|Ammonia can {{accumulate}} in highly stocked sheep accommodation, for example during live export shipments, and could affect sheep health and welfare. Thus, {{the objective of}} this experiment was to test the effects of 4 NH 3 concentrations, 4 (control), 12, 21, and 34 mg/m(3), on the physiology and behavior of wether sheep. Sheep were held for 12 d under a micro-climate and stocking density similar to shipboard conditions recorded on voyages from Australia to the Middle East during the northern hemispheric summer. Ammonia increased macrophage activity in <b>transtracheal</b> <b>aspirations,</b> indicating active pulmonary infl ammation; however, it had no effect (P > 0. 05) on hematological variables. Feed intake decreased (P = 0. 002) in proportion to ammonia concentration, and BW gain decreased (P < 0. 001) at the 2 greatest concentrations. Exposure to ammonia increased (P = 0. 03) the frequency of sneezing, and at the greatest ammonia concentration, sheep were less active, with less locomotion, pawing, and panting. Twenty-eight days after exposure to NH 3, the pulmonary macrophage activity and BW of the sheep returned to that of sheep exposed to only 4 mg/m(3). It was concluded that NH 3 induced a temporary inflammatory response of the respiratory system and reduced BW gain, which together indicated a transitory adverse effect on the welfare of sheep...|$|R
25|$|In {{patients}} {{incapable of}} producing a sputum sample, common alternative sample sources for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis include gastric washings, laryngeal swab, bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial washings, and/or transbronchial biopsy), and fine needle <b>aspiration</b> (<b>transtracheal</b> or transbronchial). In some cases, a more invasive technique is necessary, including tissue biopsy during mediastinoscopy or thoracoscopy.|$|R
40|$|A {{retrospective}} study of laboratory reports of sputums {{examined in the}} first 3 months of 1977 and of 1978 showed some interesting findings, which were similar in these 2 years.

Probable causes of such unhelpful results and some ways {{to overcome these problems}} were discussed, along with reviews of relevant literature. A conclusion drawn {{at the end of the}} discussion was that, under present circumstances, it was not expected that sputum cultures would produce totally reliable aetiological agents, unless attempts were made to obtain a better quality of specimen, e. g. those obtained by <b>transtracheal</b> or bronchoscopic <b>aspirations...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{use of the}} Gram stain for {{determination}} {{of the presence of}} bacteria in respiratory secretions is described. Success of the procedure depends on the use of fresh samples of high cellular quality.

This paper also discusses the use of sputum samples for bacteriologic culture and the value of bacterial counts in expectorated sputum, and describes the use of <b>transtracheal</b> <b>aspiration</b> and transthoracic aspiration puncture.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Use of the {{flexible}} needle via the fibreoptic bronchoscope to aspirate mediastinal nodes or masses has largely superseded {{the use of}} the rigid needle via the rigid bronchoscope. However, the yield at fibreoptic bronchoscopy is relatively low, although this improves {{with the use of a}} wider gauge needle. In this study the sensitivity and the safety of rigid needle sampling of the mediastinum in the diagnosis of lung cancer is evaluated. METHODS: <b>Transtracheal</b> needle <b>aspiration</b> (TTNA) was performed with the rigid bronchoscope and a rigid aspiration needle under general anaesthesia using a previous computed tomographic (CT) scan as a guide to the sample site. A cytopathologist immediately examined the specimens for adequacy and preliminary diagnosis, thus determining the number of aspirations. RESULTS: Twenty four patients were evaluated. The diagnostic sensitivity of TTNA was 88 %. This led to a management decision in 21 patients. There were no false positives and no complications. CONCLUSIONS: TTNA using the rigid bronchoscope with CT scanning and a cytopathologist present is a sensitive and safe way of diagnosing lung cancer in patients with a mediastinal mass or enlarged mediastinal nodes...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{anaerobic}} infections of the lung is usually {{limited to the}} use of invasivetechniques such as <b>transtracheal</b> <b>aspiration</b> (TTA) to avoid contamination by oral flora. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been used successfully {{in the study of the}} etiology of pneumonia in immuno-compromised patients. This study evaluated the role of the quantitative culture of BAL in the diagnosis of lung abscess. Four episodes of lung abscess in three patients were studied, and the results of quantitative culture of BAL were compared with those of the standard technique of TTA. Nineteen anaerobic bacterial species were recovered from the BAL fluid, all but one at concentrations> 103 cfu/ml. Culture of BAL fluid yielded 18 of 22 of the isolates cultured from TTA, including 12 of 16 of the anaerobic bacteria. This study suggests that quantitative culture of BAL fluid may be useful in the bronchoscopic evaluation of lung abscess. Lung abscesses usually result from aspiration of oral flora as well as from other anaerobic pulmonary infections such as pneumonitis, empyema, and necrotizing pneumonia [1].

40|$|A {{mouse model}} system was {{employed}} to investigate the temporal pattern of pulmonary clearance of Haemophilus influenzae and to evaluate {{the effect of the}} type b polysaccharide capsule on this clearance pattern. The lungs of BALB/c mice were inoculated with boluses of several different H. influenzae strains via an endobronchial catheter. A fully encapsulated H. influenzae type b strain multiplied readily in the lungs for at least 6 h and then was eventually cleared from the lungs over the next 18 h. The pulmonary clearance pattern obtained with an unencapsulated variant of this H. influenzae type b strain was identical to that obtained with the fully encapsulated parent strain. Two nontypable H. influenzae strains isolated by <b>transtracheal</b> <b>aspiration</b> of patients with acute H. influenzae pneumonia also multiplied in the lung and resisted significant clearance for at least 6 h after inoculation. Bolus deposition of either H. influenzae type b or nontypable H. influenzae in the lungs resulted in an eventual influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the alveoli. The observed delay in clearance of all these strains suggests that resident host defense mechanisms must be augmented for clearance to occur. Furthermore, these data indicate that one or more factors other than the Haemophilus capsule are important bacterial determinants of pulmonary clearance of H. influenzae...|$|E
40|$|Among 749 {{patients}} that required mechanical ventilation {{during the period}} from September 2000 through March 2003, 408 patients have been included in this project after 48 h of mechanical ventilation, only if the CPIS score was greater than 6, a widely accepted clinical sign of ventilator associated pneumonia. Subsequently, these 408 patients have been randomised into two groups: group A (N= 208) and group B, in which we have taken quantitative cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage and trantracheal aspiration respectively. According to cultures results the initial empiric therapy, that was started immeadeatly after protected protected <b>transtracheal</b> <b>aspiration</b> were taken, was modified appropriately. When the initial empiric therapy was not appropriate for {{at least one of the}} grown pathogens, it was modified according to antibiogram. In case that was feasible the initial empiric therapy was reduced as far as the number of antibiotics and spectrum of them was concerned, applying the deescalation practice, even when a clinically succesfull result was observed. When the culture was negative the empiric therapy was continued as before. Pneumonia was characterised as early or late when it was developed before or after 7 days of mechanical ventilation. In group A median age was 61 years, range 21 to 87. The distribution of sex was 125 males (60 %) and 83 females(40 %). In group B median age was 59 years, range 24 to 87. The distribution of sex was 131 males(66 %) and 69 females(34 %). The group A included 136 medical patients(65 %) and 72 surgical patients (35 %), whereas group B included 119 medical patients (60 %) and 81 surgical (41 %). No difference was detecetd in sex distribution (p= 0, 26), in median age (p= 0, 18), in ApacheII score (p= 0, 14),in white blood cells number (p= 0, 61), in duration of mechanical ventilation until cultures were taken(p= 0, 60), in pO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (p= 0, 73),in medical versus surgical patients ratio(p= 0, 13). In group A 169 cultures (81 %) of bronchoalveolar lavage were positive and in group B 175 cultures (88 %) of <b>transtracheal</b> <b>aspiration.</b> Mortality in group A was 24 % (50 patients) and in group B 45 % (90 patients) (x²= 19, 87, p 7 d) modification of therapy and 4 {{patients that}} succumb after early (< 7 d) modification.

40|$|Forty-six {{episodes of}} {{pulmonary}} infection occurred in 41 patients during a seven year {{period in which}} 187 renal transplants were performed in 168 patients. Thirty-seven episodes followed 152 cadaveric transplants (24. 39 %), and four episodes followed 35 living related donor transplants (11. 4 %). Five patients had two episodes of pulmonary infection. Twenty-four patients recovered, and 17 died (41. 5 %). Pulmonary infections appeared from two days to three years after transplantation, but predominated {{in the first four}} months (32 / 46). They were caused primarily by bacterial agents (74 %) with protozoa, fungi, and viruses appearing less frequently. In 35 episodes, a single etiologic agent was found, but 11 were caused by two or more agents. When compared with noninfected recipients, {{there was no significant difference}} with regard to number of rejection crises, maintenance prednisone dosage, or blood glucose. However, subnormal renal function was significantly associated with the development of infection. Azathioprine dosages were actually higher for the noninfected patients, reflecting a tendency to lower the dose of azathioprine in the presence of decreased renal function.

40|$|Transtracheal {{puncture}} {{has long}} been known as a safe, low-cost procedure. However, with the advent of bronchoscopy, it has largely been forgotten. Two researchers have suggested the use of α-amylase activity to diagnose salivary aspiration, but the normal values of this enzyme in tracheobronchial secretions are unknown. We aimed to define the normal values of α-amylase activity in tracheobronchial secretions and verify the rate of major complications of transtracheal puncture. From October 2009 to June 2011, we prospectively evaluated 118 patients without clinical or radiological signs of salivary aspiration who underwent transtracheal puncture before bronchoscopy. The patients were sedated with a solution of lidocaine and diazepam until they reached a Ramsay sedation score of 2 or 3. We then cleaned the cervical region and anesthetized the superficial planes with lidocaine. Next, we injected 10 mL of 2 % lidocaine into the tracheobronchial tree. Finally, we injected 10 mL of normal saline into the tracheobronchial tree and immediately aspirated the saline with maximum vacuum pressure to collect samples for measurement of the α-amylase level. The α-amylase level mean ± SE, median, and range were 1914 ± 240, 1056, and 24 - 10, 000 IU/L, respectively. No major complications (peripheral desaturation, subcutaneous emphysema, cardiac arrhythmia, or hemoptysis) occurred among 118 patients who underwent this procedure. <b>Transtracheal</b> <b>aspiration</b> is a safe, low-cost procedure.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{addressed}} to analyze the clinical features of chronic lower respiratory tract infections (CLRTI) due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in relation to bacteriological findings as determined by <b>transtracheal</b> <b>aspiration</b> (TTA), and also to evaluate clinically and basically a long-term chemotherapy of erythromycin (EM) or clarithromycin (CAM) against CLRTI. The following results were obtained; 1. The isolation rate of P. aeruginosa among the total isolates from CLRTI patients by TTA increased year by year. As predisposing factors to exacerbate in CLRTI caused by P. aeruginosa alone, the early colonization by P. aeruginosa in the airway or immunological status of patients was very important. Mucoid P. aeruginosa was more important as a persistent infection in CLRTI than nonmucoid P. aeruginosa. 2. A Long-term treatment of EM benefited patients with CLRTI due to P. aerzaginosa from improvement of purulent sputum, dyspnea on effort, and decreased PaO₂. CAM was able to substitute for EM when EM was not effective for CLRTI deu to P. aeruginosa. 3. EM inhibited biofilm formation in culture of human epithelial cells and P. aeruginosa. In patients with CLRTI, the administration of EM or CAM enhanced the IL- 2 producing ability of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) and also elevated serum IL- 4 levels in the early phase of treatment. Thereafter, the IL- 2 producing ability of PBMC gradually decreased and returned to the levels of healthy controls.

40|$|The author {{clinically}} evaluated {{patients with}} bronchopulmonary infections in whom any pathogens were isolated upon <b>transtracheal</b> <b>aspiration</b> (TTA) and the clinical criterion of respiratory infection was satisfied. The subjects were patients with bronchopulmonary infections which included acute bronchitis (77 cases, 82 episodes), pneumonia (130 cases, 136 episodes) and chronic {{lower respiratory tract}} infection (41 cases, 152 episodes). Major pathogens isolated upon TTA were H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis in patients with acute bronchitis. S. pneumoniae was the most clinically significant pathogen in pneumonia without the prior administration of antibiotic agents. The organisms isolated upon TTA included S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and fungi in patients with nosocomial pneumonia after the prior administration of antimicrobial agents. The isolates detected most frequently were H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa during the stable phase of chronic lower respiratory tract infection. H. influenzae {{was the most common}} pathogen in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic lower respiratory tract infection. The symptoms of acute bronchitis included fever, developed in 91. 5 % in patients, purulent sputa and cough suffered by all patients. Prior episodes of upper respiratory inflammation related to the development of acute bacterial bronchitis in 46. 3 % of patients. Antibiotic agents therapy cured acute bacterial brochitis in 96. 3 %. Analysis of host factors showed that the number of underlying diseases per patient was greater, and that general condition was poorer in the elderly group. The prognosis was poorer and incidence of adverse reactions to antimicrobial agents tended to be greater in the elderly group.

This study included an attempt to isolate the active moiety of cytotoxity against bronchial epithelial cells from H. influenzae. The following results were obtained : (1) In acute respiratory tract infection due to H. influenzae, polymicrobial infection with Streptococcus pneumonae (S. Pneumonae) and Neisseria sp., as well as immunological status of patients were involved in contraction of pneumonia. In bronchitis cases, although many cases were monomicrobial infection, polymicrobial with α-streptococcus was found in some cases. (2) In patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infection (CLRTI) due to H. influen- zae, changes in OMP of this pathogen were closely associated with acute exacerbation of CLRTI. (3) In patients with CLRTI due to H. influenzae, the administration of clarithromycin (CAM) resulted in decrease in serum IL- 6 levels during the early phase of treatment. This effect lasted as long as treatment of CAM was continued. (4) The protein with a molecular weight of 14 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE, was purified by ion-exchange chromatography, gel-filtration and chromatofocusing, and was found to exhibit cytotoxity against cultured normal human bronchial epithelial cells. These results suggest that respiratory infection caused by H. influenzae includes a variety of clinicopathological features, and that this pathogen may directly cause bronchial epith- elial damage by releasing a cytotoxic protein. Moreover, treatment of CAM may relieve CLRTI patients from sustained inflammation in the airway by supressing IL- 6 production...|$|E
