5|$|On 13 June the {{following}} year, at Euro 2016 Rosický became the oldest player to represent Czech Republic {{in the competition}} {{at the age of}} 35. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> unique for Rosický as he also holds the record for being the youngest player to have done so, having featured at Euro 2000 for his nation as a 19-year old.|$|E
5|$|The hill {{record in}} the large hill is 134.0metres, set by Germany's Jörg Ritzerfeld in 2002. However, in the summer <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> 137.0metres, set by Poland's Kamil Stoch in 2011. For the normal hill, the record of 100.5metres was {{recorded}} by Nicolas Mayer in 2010.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> {{primarily}} {{based on}} DeLonge's post-hardcore influences, such as Fugazi and Refused. The recording sessions were particularly difficult for him, {{as he had}} recently undergone back surgery. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> a concept album detailing {{the end of the}} world, and features dark, moody tracks mulling over confusion. Blink-182 bassist Mark Hoppus—the only member of that band not involved in the project—felt betrayed over his lack of inclusion, which evolved into tensions between him and DeLonge. It contributed to the band's 2005 breakup.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{being produced}} by Joe Julian, but after <b>recording</b> <b>the</b> drums, the band decided to replace him, and Beggars Banquet suggested John Brand. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>was</b> ultimately produced by Brand, but guitarist Billy Duffy {{has said that}} the drum tracks used on <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>were</b> those produced by Julian, as band drummer Nigel Preston had become too unreliable by that time.|$|R
50|$|Como's version <b>was</b> <b>recorded</b> for RCA Victor <b>Records.</b> <b>The</b> <b>recording</b> <b>was</b> made on March 19, 1963. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>was</b> {{issued by}} RCA Victor as a track on the album, The Songs I Love.|$|R

5|$|As {{with most}} small birds, {{mortality}} {{in the first}} year of life is high, but adults aged three to four years are regularly recorded, and <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> more than seven years. Eggs, chicks and fledglings of this ground-nesting species are taken by stoats, weasels and crows such as the European magpie, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey, particularly the sparrowhawk. Small birds are also at the mercy of the weather, particularly when migrating, but also on the breeding and wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Unlocked in 2014, Stan {{commenced}} working on Alesta the subsequent year at a Romanian music camp organized by Romanian composer Marius Moga; there she collaborated with three recording studios simultaneously. The title of <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> an abbreviation of Stan's stage name, also meaning 'ready' in Turkish. The accompanying artwork for the Japanese and other versions of the album show Stan posing {{in front of a}} black backdrop, with lettering displayed in white or red above her head. Editions of Alesta released by Ego Records and Warner Bros. Records featured a photograph with her laying over a motorcycle sporting a blonde wig, white underwear and a distorted pair of blue jeans.|$|E
5|$|Homer buys a book {{on world}} records {{published}} by Duff at a library sale. After boring everyone with world record trivia, Homer decides to break a record himself. He gathers the whole town to build the world's tallest human pyramid. After Jimbo and Kearney move their hands just before <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> claimed, the pyramid collapses into a giant sphere that rolls through town, taking in Agnes Skinner, Hans Moleman, and a suicidal man about to jump from a ledge onto the street. The entire town rolls to a truck weighing station and the Duff record book officials say that Springfield is the world's fattest town, ahead of Milwaukee.|$|E
5000|$|In 1989, <b>the</b> first <b>recorded</b> version <b>was</b> by <b>the</b> Maranatha! Singers on {{the label}} Maranatha!

50|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> <b>was</b> finished, Anna {{left the}} band, {{and the other}} members took turns filling in for her on the CD. Jackson Maier {{replaced}} her shortly before the CD was released, but after <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> <b>was</b> finished.|$|R
5000|$|The Delgados' {{evolution}} {{continued with}} The Great Eastern in 2000. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>was</b> produced by Dave Fridmann.

5|$|No Depression was {{critically}} acclaimed and sold well {{for an independent}} release. Selling over 15,000 copies {{within a year of}} its release, the album's success inspired the roots music magazine No Depression. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> {{considered one of the most}} important alternative country albums, and its title is often used as a synonym for the alternative country genre after being popularized by No Depression magazine. After regaining the rights to the album through a lawsuit, Uncle Tupelo released a remastered version in 2003 through Legacy Records, expanded to include six bonus tracks.|$|E
5|$|Of eggs laid, 65–93% hatch successfully, and 75–92% of {{the chicks}} {{go on to}} fledge. The {{productivity}} (young fledged per nest) varies with location, level of predation and quality of habitat, but the national figure for the UK was 2.5. The adult annual survival rate is 43% (males 46%, females 29%), and 36% of juveniles live through their first year. The typical life expectancy is two years, but <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> 13years and 10months for a bird in the Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|Of the 14 players {{eligible}} for the Hall of Fame who have hit four home runs in a game, five have been elected. Players are {{eligible for}} the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10 major league seasons and have been either retired for five seasons or deceased {{for at least six}} months. These requirements leave two players ineligible who are living and have played in the past five seasons and one (Seerey) who did not play 10 seasons in MLB. No player has ever hit four home runs in a postseason game (<b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> three).|$|E
50|$|The {{making of}} <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>was</b> a {{collaborative}} process. The members of Warrant got together {{for one week}} in November 1995 and one week in January 1996 and wrote songs together. <b>The</b> <b>recording</b> process lasted a further two weeks, and <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>was</b> mixed in seven days.|$|R

5|$|Promoted by {{the music}} press for a melodic pop-influenced sound, the Strokes {{garnered}} critical acclaim and commercial attention. Is This It was praised for its charisma and rhythm, which often referenced the works of 1970s garage rock bands. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> considered crucial {{in the development of}} other alternative bands and of the post-millennial music industry. It has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 2000s and of all time.|$|E
5|$|Some Anglo-Saxon kings {{are known}} to have been killed by their {{households}} or in open warfare against rivals, but overall <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> very sparse. The evidence as regards the deposition of kings is equally limited. Only two eighth-century depositions offer any context, those of Æthelwald Moll in Northumbria and Sigeberht of Wessex. In both cases the decision is presented as that of some form of council.|$|E
5|$|The BBRC {{conducted}} a detailed review into the controversial {{identification of a}} curlew seen at Druridge Bay in Northumberland in 1998, coming {{to the conclusion that}} it was, as had been believed by many observers, a first-summer slender-billed curlew. This identification was accepted by the British Ornithologists Union's Records Committee, leading to the addition of this species to the British List. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> currently being reviewed again by BBRC to establish whether this earlier decision should be upheld.|$|E
50|$|Cheruiyot {{broke the}} 5000 metres Kenyan record in 1996, timing 14:46.41. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>was</b> beaten in September 2000 by Leah Malot, <b>the</b> new <b>record</b> <b>was</b> 14:39.83.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> best-selling <b>recorded</b> version <b>was</b> done by Vaughn Monroe and The Sons of the Pioneers in 1948. <b>The</b> <b>recording</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} by RCA Victor as catalog number 20-2923. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>was</b> on <b>the</b> Billboard chart for 13 weeks beginning on August 6, 1948, peaking at number 9.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>records</b> <b>were</b> {{distributed}} {{four times}} a year, in boxes of seven. The operator was supposed to replace <b>records</b> in <b>the</b> system with new <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> same number (e.g. MM-125). Each box was labeled with the library type, date to place in service, and instructions for the operator (including that each <b>record</b> <b>was</b> {{to be returned to}} Seeburg after use). Upon return, <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>were</b> destroyed. A Basic library box from 1971 states that <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> property of [...] "Seeburg Music Library, Inc., 1510 N. Dayton St, Chicago 22, Ill".|$|R
5|$|The {{legs are}} {{composed}} of seven segments, and attach {{on the underside of}} the body. The legs of an individual are generally rather similar to each other, although often longer in males than females, and males of some species may have a reduced or enlarged first pair of legs. The most conspicuous leg modifications are involved in reproduction, discussed below. Despite the common name, no millipede has been discovered with 1,000 legs: common species have between 34 and 400 legs, and <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> held by Illacme plenipes, with individuals possessing up to 750 legs – more than any other creature on Earth.|$|E
5|$|According to {{box office}} {{analysis}} sites, the film set American records for highest gross {{in a given}} number of days for each of its first 12 days of release except for the seventh and eighth, where <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> narrowly held by Spider-Man 2. On its fifth day, it became the highest-grossing film of 2005, surpassing Hitch ($177.6million). The film earned $158.5million in its first four-day period, surpassing the previous four-day record held by The Matrix Reloaded ($134.3million), and joining Spider-Man, The Matrix Reloaded and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire as one the only films to make $100million in three days. In eight days, it reached the $200million mark (a record tied with Spider-Man 2) and by its 17th day, the film had passed $300million (surpassing the record of 18 days of Shrek 2). It was eventually the third-fastest film (after Shrek 2 and Spider-Man) to reach $350 million.|$|E
5|$|Antichrist Superstar is a rock opera concept album, and {{its title}} {{is based on}} the 1971 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Jesus Christ Superstar. It is {{primarily}} an industrial metal record, and contains material which has been described as industrial rock and death metal, as well as progressive metal, new wave and gothic rock. The album's central storyline revolves around a supernatural being who seizes power in order to initiate an apocalyptic end event. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> a social critique which utilizes this premise {{as a metaphor for the}} fascist elements of the Christian right in North America. The band's frontman has said that the underlying concept of Antichrist Superstar was both inspired by and a tribute to the work of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, specifically his philosophical concept of an Übermensch.|$|E
5000|$|In August, 1962 <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} as <b>the</b> B-side of [...] "Bad Boy" [...] on larger New York label Brent. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>was</b> discovered by George Harrison and <b>recorded</b> by <b>the</b> Beatles in 1963 retitled as [...] "Devil in Her Heart".|$|R

5|$|In July 2016 García, who was Real Sociedad's only {{representative}} in the squad, captained Spain to {{a silver medal}} at the UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship, losing 2–1 in the final to hosts France. She had two opportunities to draw Spain level but found herself {{the victim of a}} waterlogged pitch, missing a penalty in the opening half before skying a near-open goal opportunity in injury-time {{as a result of the}} on-field conditions. The match was suspended for over two hours after half-time due to the weather conditions and upon the players' return to the pitch certain sections of the field were entirely waterlogged. García was ridiculed by large sections of the media for the miss but received overwhelming support from her fan-base, prompting her to take to Instagram following the tournament to thank those who stood behind her and the team. The showpiece match was her third appearance in a continental final, having previously ended as runner-up in the tournament's previous edition and as well as in the UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship in 2014. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> one which she shares with teammates Andrea Sánchez Falcón and Naria Garrote.|$|E
5|$|In a {{small sample}} of 11 {{deceased}} dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7years (maximum 15.9yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41years {{with a standard deviation of}} 2.36years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5years, but <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{of adult}} nuthatches include owls and diurnal {{birds of prey}} (such as sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small squirrels, and {{climbing}} snakes such as the western rat snake. The white-breasted nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making hn-hn calls. When a bird leaves the nest hole, it wipes around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation; this makes it more difficult for a predator to find the nest using its sense of smell. The nuthatch may also smear blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities. The estimated average lifespan of this nuthatch is two years, but <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>is</b> twelve years and nine months.|$|E
