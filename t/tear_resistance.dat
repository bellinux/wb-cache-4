40|$|AbstractDetermination of <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> of {{heterogeneous}} dissimilar metal welds (DMW) {{that are}} critical structures of pipes in nuclear power plants (NPPs) is important in assessment of the structural integrity. Currently, <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> of heterogeneous materials is determined by standards developed for homogeneous materials. The fracture behaviour of heterogeneous materials differs from fracture behaviour of homogeneous materials. Thus standards developed for homogeneous materials are not necessary directly applicable to heterogeneous materials. To develop a standard for heterogeneous materials {{the current level of}} knowledge of fracture behaviour in heterogeneous specimens needs to be increased. To enhance the knowledge of fracture in heterogeneous materials <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> of 10 × 10 × 55 mm 3 and 10 × 20 × 100 mm 3 single edge bend (SE(B)) specimens extracted from a NPP ferrite-austenite DMW were measured. The specimens were extracted at three different crack locations in a region close to the fusion line between ferritic steel and weld metal of the DMW. As <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> curves of the two specimen geometries are compared toughness and scatter varies, which can be explained by differing crack location with respect to the fusion line. However, the effect of crack location on <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> was not microstructurally quantified, but the qualitative analysis of crack location done in this work implies that a standard developed for heterogeneous materials shall contain guidelines on characterisation of crack location...|$|R
2500|$|Chain extenders (f=2) {{and cross}} linkers (f≥3) are low {{molecular}} weight hydroxyl and amine terminated compounds that {{play an important role}} in the polymer morphology of polyurethane fibers, [...] elastomers, adhesives, and certain integral skin and microcellular foams. The elastomeric properties of these materials are derived from the phase separation of the hard and soft copolymer segments of the polymer, such that the urethane hard segment domains serve as cross-links between the amorphous polyether (or polyester) soft segment domains. This phase separation occurs because the mainly nonpolar, low melting soft segments are incompatible with the polar, high melting hard segments. The soft segments, which are formed from high molecular weight polyols, are mobile and are normally present in coiled formation, while the hard segments, which are formed from the isocyanate and chain extenders, are stiff and immobile. Because the hard segments are covalently coupled to the soft segments, they inhibit plastic flow of the polymer chains, thus creating elastomeric resiliency. Upon mechanical deformation, a portion of the soft segments are stressed by uncoiling, and the hard segments become aligned in the stress direction. This reorientation of the hard segments and consequent powerful hydrogen bonding contributes to high tensile strength, elongation, and <b>tear</b> <b>resistance</b> values.|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of ductile <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> has since long {{been focused on}} high constraint single edge notch bend and compact tension specimens.

This work compares two measurement techniques for the evaluation of ductile crack extension in such specimens. It is observed that both the unloading compliance and the direct current potential drop technique allow an accurate measurement.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between microstructure and fracture resistance of TRIP-assisted multiphase steels {{has been investigated}} by processing and characterizing eight specifically designed microstructures differing {{in terms of the}} volume fractions of the constitutive phases, i. e. ferrite, bainite, retained austenite and martensite, by the stability of the retained austenite. and by the connectivity of the phases. Fracture resistance has been quantified by the fracture strain in uniaxial tension, epsilon(-f), the fracture toughness at cracking initiation, J(1 c). and by the essential work of fracture, w(e). The fracture mechanisms were characterized by microscopic observations and by profilometric measurements of the crack lip necking process typical in thin sheet fracture. The fracture toughness at cracking initiation of TRIP-aided steels corresponds to an equivalent Dual Phase steel in which martensite replaces retained austenite and is thus not affected by the retained austenite stability. The ductile <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> of TRIP-aided steels, quantified by w(e), increases significantly with the retained austenite stability. This improved <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> is explained by the effect of the additional work-hardening induced by the late transformation Of retained austenite within the crack tip necking zone.

The equations correctly predict the observed failure mode in the full-scale tests as well as the tensile strain capacity. Simplified, conservative tensile strain capacity equations with fewer parameters have been developed by making reasonable assumptions for several key parameters.

40|$|The {{permanence}} of printed documents and books {{appears to be}} primarily dependent on paper stability. Other researchers implicate pH as {{a major factor in}} the deterioration rate of paper and acidity as major the cause of this deterioration. During the lithographic printing process, ink is in direct contact with fountain solution, which can be acidic or alkaline. Fountain solution is a mixture of water and chemicals used to keep the non-image areas of a lithographic plate moist. On press the intimate contact of ink with fountain solution creates a fountain solution-in-ink emulsion. The emulsion used here is a stable suspension of fountain solution droplets within the ink. The objective of this study was to determine if ink/fountain solution emulsion, which is printed on paper during lithographic printing, affects the rate of deterioration of paper. The stability of four commonly available papers was observed. These paper types were groundwood, publication grade, coated book, and uncoated book. Samples of the four paper groups were printed with four different ink formulations. The ink formulations were ink, ink and distilled water, ink and acidic fountain solution, and ink and alkaline fountain solution. Samples of the unprinted and printed paper were subjected to an accelerated - aging process by heating the samples for 72 hours at 100 C. The properties of unaged and aged papers were evaluated by pH determination, folding endurance, and <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance.</b> On the basis of statistical analysis of the data, inferences were made about the effect of the ink formulations on the paper properties. This experiment indicates that ink/fountain solution emulsion did affect the paper pH, but this effect is due to the ink with little change in pH due to the addition of acidic or alkaline fountain solution to the ink. The results of folding endurance and <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> tests after accelerated aging established no clear pattern of variance that would indicate the differences observed in these properties were due to the pH change associated with the ink/fountain solution emulsions. Several unexpected occurrences were exhibited by this experiment. These include: groundwood was the paper least affected by the aging process; the pH of coated paper increased with the application of ink/fountain solution emulsion; a decrease in <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> was associated with alkaline fountain solution...|$|R
