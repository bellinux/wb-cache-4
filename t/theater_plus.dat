50|$|Similarly, the Cinerama audio soundtrack technology, {{developed}} by Hazard E. Reeves, {{a pioneer in}} magnetic recording, utilized seven discrete sound tracks on full-coat magnetic 35mm film, in order to envelop the theatregoer in an aural experience just as spectacular as that playing on the screen: five main channels behind the screen, two surround channels {{in the rear of}} the <b>theater,</b> <b>plus</b> a sync-track to interlock the 4 machines, which were specially outfitted with aircraft servo-motors made by Ampex.|$|E

He also designed residential estates such as Castillo Serrallés (1926) and Residencia Jacobo Cabassa (1934), both in Ponce.

50|$|The {{encircling}} {{structure of}} the <b>theater,</b> <b>plus</b> {{the possibility of the}} audience at the field of being standing and being able to move to the place they find most attractive, make of this the experience of assisting to a representation, an unforgettable one. In this kind of spaces, the well known quote attributed to the English author “All the world’s a stage”, makes a lot of sense. Shakespeare thought his plays to be performed in these theaters, and that is why his texts are redefined when worked in this type of theatrical space.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his late}} teens, Woods started {{traveling}} outside of Missouri into Oklahoma and Texas, playing for stage plays, Vaudeville olios, silent films, and other accompanist positions. His performance skills eventually saw him lauded in print as the [...] "Ragtime Wonder of the South." [...] He was married by 1913 {{or so to}} Marie E. Woods, and Clarence Jr. was born around 1914. In early 1917 he was listed at a Carthage residence of 301 N. Main, and playing for movies at the Sho-To-Al Theater. By 1920 Woods and the family had moved north to Nevada, Missouri, now playing for movies at the Star <b>Theater</b> <b>plus</b> other area engagements.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, Richard Slone and Tom Petersen began {{fundraising}} in {{the community}} {{with the goal of}} purchasing the theater, refurbishing it, and converting it to an arthouse movie theater that would also host live music, theater productions and community events. The X-rated movie titles on the Cinema marquee had hindered any neighborhood redevelopment, and Slone and Petersen were able to find many backers who wanted to revive the area, including Trinity Lutheran Church and the CEO of Madison Kipp Corporation, Reed Coleman. Another early investor was future (now current) general manager of the Barrymore, Steve Sperling. Once the <b>theater</b> (<b>plus</b> its three attached storefronts) was bought for $150,000 and renovated for $100,000 more, the Barrymore Theatre (named after the famous acting family) opened on July 10, 1987.|$|E

50|$|About $6.5 {{million in}} Federal Funding was made {{available}} for construction to accommodate quarters and other facilities for up to 50,000 military personnel at Fort McClellan. Overall improvements included 74 miles (118 km) of new roads, sewage facilities for 50,000 persons, a huge general hospital with 80 wooden buildings connected by 4.5 miles (7.2 km) of catwalks, 5 <b>theaters</b> <b>plus</b> an amphitheater seating 12,000 persons, 27 warehouses, and many ammunition-storage bunkers. Hundreds of five- and fifteen-man hutments, arranged in Company-level groups, were built for personnel being trained. Colonel John L. Jenkins was the Commanding Officer (1941-1944) {{during most of the}} construction period. The land area of Fort McClellan was also greatly expanded. Directly to the east, a mountainous peninsula connecting to the Talladega National Forest was acquired, allowing access to this Federal Area for training maneuvers. This increased the reservation to a total of 42,286 acres (169.1 km²). A few miles to the west, a 22,168-acre (86.7-km²) tract was purchased for $675,000 and used for artillery and heavy mortar ranges, tank firing, and bivouac areas. This is directly north of another Army facility, the Anniston Army Depot. The range was initially called Morrisville Maneuvering Area and later changed to Pelham Range, named for John Pelham, a hero in the Confederate cavalry during the American Civil War, who was raised in that area.|$|R

The Penguinarium is planned to be converted into a Bat Conservation Center since the penguin center has opened.|$|E
5000|$|Show {{boats were}} {{floating}} theaters that traveled along rivers of the United States from the 1870s to the 1930s. The performers lived aboard the vessels. With song, dance, and dramatic productions, show boats provided entertainment for small riverside towns that were otherwise quite isolated. Ferber, {{who had never}} heard of show boats, was immediately intrigued:"Here, I thought, {{was one of the most}} melodramatic and gorgeous bits of Americana that had ever come my way. It was not only the theater — it was the <b>theater</b> <b>plus</b> the glamour of the wandering drifting life, the drama of the river towns, the mystery and terror of the Mississippi itself... I spent a year hunting down every available scrap of show-boat material; reading, interviewing, taking notes and making outlines." ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a reflection on}} conflicts in school {{from the point of}} view of a group of teachers. I present a proposal for training teachers in which we work with theater games associated with playwright, with reflection on both permeating all work. I chose starting from relevant thematic about the daily life of this group of teachers, exploring them scenically, through the participation in improvisations based on the <b>theater</b> game, <b>plus</b> the reflection on them and playwrighting, so building a proposal for ongoing formation in which the teacher experienced a creative mode of thinking about his practice. Think about all the concerns and issues presented was a great opportunity to understand the school in many ways...|$|R

40|$|Rainer Maria Rilke's The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge (1910) {{are viewed}} as {{a new kind of}} theater for the modern age. Through protagonist Malte's {{subjective}} imagination we witness sound and silence, visualize scenery and lighting, observe how costumes affect perception of character, and discover a connection between Malte's masks and masks in Greek theater. These technical aspects of <b>theater,</b> <b>plus</b> two special effects, support the premise of Malte as an actor. Learning to see opens him to empathize with others. Remembering the past helps Malte to understand his present and helps him discover the great human drama represented at Orange. From the St. Vitus Dancer, Malte learns how to play a role, which leads him through rehearsal for his part, the Prodigal Son. At last Malte comes to lerms with love, Abelone, and God, and finds a secure self behind a role on the world's stage. ...|$|E
