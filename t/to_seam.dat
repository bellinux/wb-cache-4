25|$|Taylor {{played his}} best cricket {{of the summer}} in the Third Test at Sydney. Last man out for 49 {{in a total of}} 116 in the first innings, he defied a pitch that had begun <b>to</b> <b>seam</b> and swing after a shower and cloud cover as Australia {{narrowly}} avoided the follow on. In the second innings, he made a bold attempt at chasing a world record target of 449 by scoring 113, but Australia played for a draw after Slater and Taylor fell following double-century stand. Australia collapsed to 7/292 before hanging on in near-darkness. In the final two Tests, he scored half-centuries as Australia won 3–1. Australia dramatically lost the Fourth Test when England led by only 154 on the final day with four wickets in hand. Aggressive lower order batting saw Australia set 328 in just over two sessions, but a heavy collapse saw Australia eight wickets down with more than hours to play. Almost two hours of resistance later, England took a 106-run win late in day. However, Australia bounced back to win the Fifth Test by 329 runs, the largest margin of the series. Taylor's partnership with Slater yielded three century opening stands at an average of 76.60 for the series and Taylor's individual return was 471 runs at 47.10.|$|E

50|$|Although {{there was}} never any {{official}} word that the 1953 season would be the Browns' last in St. Louis, there were enough unofficial signs that attendance flatlined to only 3,860 fans per game. Under the circumstances, the Browns made a wretched showing, finishing 54-100, 46 games out of first. This was partly because late in the season, the Browns were running so low on baseballs that they were forced to ration them during batting practice. When what would be the Browns' last game in St. Louis—a 2-1 loss to the White Sox—went into extra innings, the Browns had so few baseballs on hand that the umpires were forced to recycle the least damaged ones that had previously been used. Reportedly, the last ball used was gashed from seam <b>to</b> <b>seam.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Cook took 139 wickets in 1950, but by {{this time}} Johnny Wardle, Malcolm Hilton and later Tony Lock - all far better batsmen and fieldsmen - were able {{to prevent him from}} having the {{slightest}} chance of returning to Test cricket. Owing to the loss of Goddard, Cook faltered a little between 1951 and 1955, but the very wet summer and dry spring of 1956 allowed him to form a devastating combination with Bomber Wells that led Cook to his best season ever with 149 wickets for less than fifteen runs apiece, including an amazing ten for 35 against Worcestershire and thirteen for 121 against Nottinghamshire. The following two seasons were moderate, but with the newly found spinning riches of John Mortimore and David Allen, Gloucestershire acquired the most formidable bowling attack in the country during the brilliant summer of 1959, with Cook [...] "making full use of his wealth of experience". In this period Gloucestershire, as in the days of Parker, Goddard and Sinfield, often played three spinners, right up to the time when Cook retired in 1964. However, despite heading the first-class bowling averages for the only time in 1962, Cook's extreme weakness with the bat and in the field saw him left out of many matches even in that season and on grassier pitches the switch in emphasis <b>to</b> <b>seam</b> bowling made things even tougher for Cook as he grew older.|$|E
50|$|Oil and gas {{separators}} {{can have}} three general configurations: vertical, horizontal, and spherical.Vertical separators can vary {{in size from}} 10 or 12 inches in diameter and 4 to 5 feet seam <b>to</b> <b>seam</b> (S to S) up to 10 or 12 feet in diameter and 15 to 25 feet S to S. Horizontal separators may vary in size from 10 or 12 inches in diameter and 4 to 5 feet S to S up to 15 to 16 feet in diameter and 60 to 70 feet S to S. Spherical separators are usually available in 24 or 30 inch up to 66 to 72 inch in diameter.Horizontal oil and gas separators are manufactured with monotube and dual-tube shells. Monotube units have one cylindrical shell, and dual-tube units have two cylindrical parallel shells with one above the other. Both types of units {{can be used for}} two-phase and three-phase service. A monotube horizontal oil and gas separator is usually preferred over a dual-tube unit. The monotube unit has greater area for gas flow as well as a greater oil/gas interface area than is usually available in a dual-tube separator of comparable price. The monotube separator will usually afford a longer retention time because the larger single-tube vessel retains a larger volume of oil than the dual-tube separator. It is also easier to clean than the dualtube unit.In cold climates, freezing will likely cause less trouble in the monotube unit because the liquid is usually in close contact with the warm stream of gas flowing through the separator. The monotube design normally has a lower silhouette than the dual-tube unit, and it is easier to stack them for multiple-stage separation on offshore platforms where space is limited. It was illustrated by Powers et al (1990) that vertical separators should be constructed such that the flow stream enters near the top and passes through a gas/liquid separating chamber even though they are not competitive alternatives unlike the horizontal separators.|$|E
