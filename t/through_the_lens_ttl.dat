50|$|The Leicaflex {{lacked a}} few {{features}} {{present in the}} most advanced products of its time. It has been much criticized for omitting a <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> (<b>TTL)</b> exposure meter of the type which had previously been incorporated into the Topcon RE Super and the Asahi Pentax Spotmatic, and which would soon appear in the Nikon F Photomic T, Canon Pellix {{and a number of}} other reflex cameras. It also lacked the interchangeable viewfinders offered for the Miranda, Canon Canonflex, and Nikon F. Finally, the original Leicaflex featured a finder which, while offering a very bright aerial image, was not full focusing, offering only a small focusing zone at the center. The Leicaflex did offer mirror lock-up, and shutter speeds up to 1/2000 visible in the finder.|$|E
50|$|The first {{camera to}} employ the {{pellicle}} mirror as a beam splitter was the Canon Pellix, launched by Canon Camera Company Inc. Japan in 1965. The object was to accomplish exposure measurement <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> (<b>TTL),</b> which was pioneered by Tokyo Kogaku KK, Japan in the 1963 Topcon RE Super. That employed a CdS meter cell placed behind the reflex mirror that had narrow slits cut into the surface to let the light reach the cell. Canon improved on the idea by making the mirror semi-translucent and fixed. The meter cell was swung into the light-path behind the mirror by operating a lever on the right-hand camera front for stopped down exposure reading, momentarily dimming the viewfinder. Two thirds of {{the light from the}} camera lens was let through the mirror, while the rest was reflected up to the viewfinder screen. The Pellix pellicle mirror was an ultra-thin (0.02 mm) Mylar film with a vapour deposited semi reflecting layer. Since there was no mirror blackout, the user could see the image at the moment of exposure.|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the capability of}} a laser micromachining workstation for cost-effective manufacturing {{of a variety of}} microfluidic devices, including SU- 8 microchannels on silicon wafers and 3 D complex structures made on polyimide Kapton® or poly carbonate (PC). The workstation combines a KrF excimer laser at 248 nm and a Nd 3 +:YVO 4 DPSS with a frequency tripled at 355 nm with a lens magnification 10 X, both lasers working at a pulsed regime with nanoseconds (ns) pulse duration. Workstation also includes a high-resolution motorized XYZ-tilt axis (1 um / axis) and a <b>Through</b> <b>The</b> <b>Lens</b> (<b>TTL)</b> imaging system for a high accurate positioning over a 120 x 120 mm working area. We have surveyed different fabrication techniques: direct writing lithography,mask manufacturing for contact lithography and polymer laser ablation for complex 3 D devices, achieving width channels down to 13 μ m on 50 μ m SU- 8 thickness using direct writing lithography, and width channels of 40 μm for polyimide on SiO 2 plate. Finally, we have tested the use of some devices for capillary chips measuring the flow speed for liquids with different viscosities. As a result, we have characterized the presence of liquid in the channel by interferometric microscopy...|$|E
