[...] "When Alvis Jr. was {{three or four years}} old, he walked into the house and announced that his name also was [...] "Buck." [...] <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> with the family, and the boy's name was Buck from then on." [...] He attended public school for grades 13 in Garland, Texas.|$|E
2500|$|Rowling {{pretended to}} bang {{her head against}} the sofa in mock frustration. [...] "SO {{much has been made of}} that," [...] she groans, noting that it was only done where words had been used that really meant {{something}} very different to Americans. Her American editor pointed out that the word jumper – British for pullover sweater – means a kind of dress in American. She had had no idea. [...] "He asked, 'Can we change it to sweater,' which is just as British?" [...] <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> with Rowling.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1986 Globe and Mail interview, Shaver {{said that}} she was being {{considered}} for a role in Joshua Then and Now, which would have promoted her career much farther than Desert Hearts. Donna Deitch assured her over the phone that she was right for her movie and told her she refused to hang up the phone until she got an answer. After five minutes, Shaver accepted the role. Shaver explained her feelings about the film. [...] "I was scared, not about the lesbianism [...] the script said, 'The passion builds' in the love scene, so once I knew how the passion built and where the camera would be, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> [...] but because someone wanted me to do what I'd wanted to do all along, and here it was, and all I had to do was say yes. I had always wanted to carry a movie. Now, if I never make another one, I've done this. For the first time, I feel I've done a complete work on film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moakler {{started dating}} boxer Oscar De La Hoya in October 1997 {{and they moved}} in {{together}} in early 1998. Moakler and De La Hoya became engaged prior to the 1999 birth of their daughter, Atiana Cecilia De La Hoya (born March 29, 1999). Moakler has said [...] "it wasn't a planned pregnancy, but it was understood if it happened it was beautiful and if it didn't <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> too." [...] In September 2000, the relationship abruptly ended when Moakler, who was at home watching the Latin Grammy Awards on television, saw De La Hoya escorting another woman to the show. In December 2000, Moakler filed a $62.5 million palimony suit against her ex-fiancé, claiming he was an alcoholic, abusive to her and to their daughter, and that he used them [...] "as props to promote his public image." [...] The case was {{settled out of court}} in 2001 for an undisclosed amount. After the time of De La Hoya's split from Moakler, he had little contact with his daughter, although he continued to provide financial support.|$|E

60|$|My father's face {{shone with}} {{the light of the}} explorer, the pioneer. The words of this song appealed to him as the finest poetry. It meant all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> and hopeful and buoyant in American life, to him--but on my mother's sweet face a wistful {{expression}} deepened and in her fine eyes a reflective shadow lay. To her this song meant not so much the acquisition of a new home as the loss of all her friends and relatives. She sang it submissively, not exultantly, and I think the other women were of the same mood though their faces were less expressive to me. To all of the pioneer wives of the past that song had meant deprivation, suffering, loneliness, heart-ache.|$|E

60|$|It was {{wonderful}} to see them; for as they came onwards they got ahead of their own guns, so {{that they had no}} longer any help from them, while they got in front of the two batteries which had been on either side of us all day. Every gun had their range to a foot, and we saw long red lines scored right down the dark column as it advanced. So near were they, and so closely did they march, that every shot ploughed through ten files of them, and yet they closed up and came on with a swing and dash <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> to see. Their head was turned straight for ourselves, while the 95th overlapped them {{on one side and the}} 52nd on the other.|$|E

6000|$|As {{he climbed}} the yellow, grassy mountain-side, working round above the valley, his mind was not {{centered}} on the task at hand, but on Wilson Moore, {{who had come to}} rely on him with the unconscious tenacity of a son whose faith in his father was unshakable. The crippled cowboy kept his hope, kept his cheerful, grateful spirit, obeyed and suffered with a patience <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine.</b> There had been no improvement in his injured foot. Wade worried about that much more than Moore. The thing that mostly occupied the cowboy was the near approach of October first, with its terrible possibility for him. He did not talk about it, except when fever made him irrational, but it was plain to Wade how he prayed and hoped and waited in silence. Strange how he trusted Wade to avert catastrophe of Columbine's marriage! Yet such trust seemed familiar to Wade, as he reflected over past years. Had he not wanted such trust--had he not invited it? ...|$|E

6000|$|Above me towered {{the colossal}} edifice of society, {{and to my}} mind {{the only way out}} was up. Into this edifice I early {{resolved}} to climb. Up above, men wore black clothes and boiled shirts, and women dressed in beautiful gowns. Also, there were good things to eat, and there was plenty to eat. This much for the flesh. Then there were the things of the spirit. Up above me, I knew, were unselfishnesses of the spirit, clean and noble thinking, keen intellectual living. I knew all this because I read [...] "Seaside Library" [...] novels, in which, {{with the exception of the}} villains and adventuresses, all men and women thought beautiful thoughts, spoke a beautiful tongue, and performed glorious deeds.

60|$|So {{we talked}} for quite a little time, and I told him about Uncle trying to get work and {{how hard it was}} and how at last he had got work, or at least had gone out to get it, as a painter. Mr. Peters said that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine.</b> He said that {{painters}} do well here: {{he has a lot of}} friends who are painters and they get all the way from sixty to seventy-five cents an hour. It seems so odd to think of them being paid by the hour. I don't think the court artists at home were paid like that. It will be very nice if Uncle William can mingle with Mr. Peters's artist friends. Mr. Peters asked if he might take me out some Sunday, and I said that I would ask Uncle William and Uncle Henry and Cousin Ferdinand and Cousin Willie and if they all consented to come I would go. I hope it was not a forward thing to do.|$|E
60|$|In {{the field}} the Dwarf had no assignment; {{that is to}} say, he was not under orders to occupy any {{particular}} place, therefore he chose his place for himself, and went ahead of Joan and made a road for her. It was horrible to see the iron helmets fly into fragments under his dreadful ax. He called it cracking nuts, {{and it looked like}} that. He made a good road, and paved it well with flesh and iron. Joan {{and the rest of us}} followed it so briskly that we outspeeded our forces and had the English behind us as well as before. The knights commanded us to face outward around Joan, which we did, and then there was work done <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> to see. One was obliged to respect the Paladin, now. Being right under Joan's exalting and transforming eye, he forgot his native prudence, he forgot his diffidence in the presence of danger, he forgot what fear was, and he never laid about him in his imaginary battles in a more tremendous way that he did in this real one; and wherever he struck there was an enemy the less.|$|E
