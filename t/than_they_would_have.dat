This not only made the film longer, but demonstrated that advances in film language could be made in editing as well as shooting. Additionally, the editing of Rescued by Rover is notable in its use of time contractions, which made Rover's journeys take considerably less time by portrayal <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> in reality.|$|E
5|$|Under the O Act, the Department of the Interior {{under its}} General Land Office and later succeeded by the Bureau of Land Management, managed more than 44 billion board feet of {{standing}} inventory in 1937 {{into more than}} 60 billion board feet by the mid-1990s, and harvested more than 44 billion board feet over that time period. In 1951, the U.S. Treasury had been fully reimbursed, and the 25 percent of the revenue that had previously gone to the Treasury now reverted to the counties; in 1953, the counties opted to divert that money to maintenance {{of the land and}} roads, reforestation, as well as recreational facilities and other improvements. A 1970 GAO report contained an estimate that from its implementation through 1969, the counties had received a total of $300 million {{as a result of the}} Act. The authors of the report also estimated that most counties received more from the government payments <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> if the land had been held privately.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{publishers}} of erotic romance are either small press publishers or electronic book publishers. Writers often have more leeway {{as to what}} types of erotic acts can be included when working with an electronic publisher <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> when working with a print publisher. The market for erotic romances has been growing rapidly, leading some publishers to create new lines for these types of books. Some subjects are still considered taboo, even with erotic romance.

They had beaten the West Indies 3–1 earlier in the year, but South African cricket was described as being {{in a state of}} 'freefall'. In Test matches also South Africa suffered a poor run with series losses to England, India and Sri Lanka. They did nevertheless win a home Test series against the West Indies (with Smith and Gibbs sharing their third 300-run opening partnership).|$|E

NZ Cricket lost the services of Shane Bond, Lou Vincent, Andre Adams, Hamish Marshall and Daryl Tuffey. The {{money to be made}} from Twenty-20 cricket in India may have also induced players, such as Craig McMillan and Scott Styris (from Test cricket) to retire earlier <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> otherwise.

25|$|Throughout this time, Ward's {{reputation}} {{continued to}} grow. Ward himself, outwardly caring little for public adulation, still sought to quench some inner {{need for further}} glory, and hoped {{to participate in an}} eventual strike against Nanjing, the Taiping capital, but this would not be. The Manchu court, suspicious of Ward from the beginning, grew even more concerned that as time passed, he refused to shave his forehead, wear a queue or even appear in his fine Mandarin robes. These and other comments regarding his ambitions led the court to limit the size of his unit far beneath his potential to recruit for it, and to give Ward far less rein <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to a commander with more Confucian leanings.|$|E
25|$|General Ludendorff {{stated in}} his memoirs that he {{believed}} the entry of the Turks into the war allowed the outnumbered Central powers to fight on for two years longer <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been able on their own, a view shared by historian Ian F.W. Beckett. The war was extended to the Middle East with main fronts of Gallipoli, the Sinai and Palestine, Mesopotamia, and the Caucasus. The {{course of the war}} in the Balkans was also influenced by the entry of the Ottoman Empire {{on the side of the}} Central Powers. Had the war ended in 1916, some of the bloodiest engagements, such as the Battle of the Somme, would have been avoided. The United States might not have been drawn from its policy of isolation to intervene in a foreign war.|$|E

25|$|The second {{match was}} a more even affair. It was held at Westpac Stadium, Wellington, on 24 January. New Zealand batted first and scored well in the early stages, but lost wickets at vital times, much of the damage being done by bowlers Andrew Bichel and Lance Klusener. Only Nathan Astle was able to produce a large score, {{finishing}} on 109. New Zealand were all out for 256, a respectable score, but less <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> wanted on what was a good batting pitch. The total {{was never going to}} be enough, however, especially after Matthew Elliott and Nick Knight got the World XI off to a flying start. Elliott was particularly belligerent, his 57 runs including three sixes. Although the World XI lost several wickets, their batting continued at a fast pace, and they reached the required target in the 48th over for the loss of seven wickets.|$|E
25|$|British Intelligence did {{not predict}} {{the scale of}} Georgette, {{although}} in fairness the Germans were changing their plans frequently and only finalised their intentions {{a week or so}} beforehand. The Germans enjoyed significant artillery superiority (although less <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> preferred after the intense fighting in the Somme sector) and some of the BEF line was held by poor-quality Portuguese divisions. Foch visited Haig at 1pm on 9 April, and again refused Haig’s demand that the French take over more BEF line so as to free up a British reserve. Haig felt that Foch’s proposal to deploy 4 French divisions west of Amiens would simply increase Rawlinson’s logistical troubles without doing much to help. On 10 April Georgette was extended northwards, as von Arnim’s Fourth Army also attacked, forcing the evacuation of Armentieres by Du Cane’s XV Corps. Haig yet again demanded that the French take over “some portion” of the British line and give French assistance “in order … to continue the battle”.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the Humble eBook Bundle, John Scalzi {{noted that}} various factors, such as brand name recognition, a lack of DRM, a focus on charity, the {{uniqueness}} of the bundle and its format, and the variety of included authors, all made the Humble eBook Bundle a success. Scalzi notes that while people who participate in Humble Bundles will get less in net profit <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> without the bundle (due to the variable percentages patrons can donate and publishers taking their cut of proceeds), but in return receive greater volume (the Humble Bundle sold 42,000 copies of eBooks in two weeks, almost as much as the average monthly bestseller). In conclusion, Scalzi lauds the idea of the Humble Bundle, and notes to future contributors that while the bundle is low-margin, it's also low-risk. Novelist Cory Doctorow, who organized both eBook bundles, noted that while no publisher aside from Tor Books would participate in the bundle because of no-DRM stipulations, they still raised around $2 million for books whose circulations were earning their authors little to no money.|$|E

25|$|After {{the first}} stretch between Amsterdam and Haarlem proved viable, the company decided to {{complete}} the line to Rotterdam. Some people, especially the wealthy landowners, weren't too fond of the railway crossing their land, while other people {{were interested in the}} economic potential of the railway. This led to a rather famous incident when Aernout Hendrik van Wickevoort Crommelin, the owner of a small parcel of land in Delft which lay directly {{in the path of the}} railway, only wanted to sell his land in exchange for a train station at a place favorable to him. The HSM first tried to use legal means to buy the land, but when that took too long, they simply built the railway with a sharp curve around the land. Van Wickevoort, seeing that his plan had failed, then donated the land to the railway. This small change in the route had only been operational for five days, but cost the railroad more <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> spent fulfilling Van Wickevoorts' demands. This incident is referred to as 'Het laantje van Van der Gaag'.|$|E
25|$|Studying {{earthquakes}} {{has shown}} to be a difficult task when considering all the limitations created by natural disasters. Clinical interviews are difficult because of the widespread damage to infrastructure and roads, which leads to reliance on self-report. Self-report can introduce bias to results, leading to skewed data. Researchers are unable to reliably compare an individual's mental health status to their health status previous to the trauma because they must rely on retrospective self-report. Retrospective self-report is affected greatly by the individual's current state of distress. The displacement of large numbers of citizens following a trauma poses as a problem for researchers of natural disasters. It is predicted {{that the people who are}} displaced experience the worst of the damage, and therefore the reported levels of PTSD and depression are often lower <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been had the displaced citizens been available to collect data from. Because large number of citizens are being displaced, it is difficult to find a representative sample population. For example, after the Christchurch earthquakes, studies reported that older educated females of European New Zealand descent were over represented in their sample population, which isn't accurate of the Christchurch population as a whole.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{individuals}} may actually {{find it easier}} to escape situations of abuse in the United States <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> in their countries of origin. Among some immigrants there is much criticism {{of the way in which}} women in particular have been changed by American culture. Women may be seen as too Americanized because of the way they dress or their lack of deference to men. The general support for gender equality within American society can undermine traditional power hierarchies within the family in which men had control over the actions of women. One of the ways that such power is undermined is through the presence of laws against domestic violence. In some patriarchal societies, husbands may have complete control over their wives, including control over their bodies. U.S. laws do not support this sort of arrangement and women who are aware of their rights can utilize formal legal institutions to combat such gender imbalances within the family. The ability of government authorities to intervene in the realm of the family can undermine the traditional power balance and leave men feeling dispossessed.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the nobles}} tended {{to live in}} Jerusalem rather than on estates in the countryside, they had a larger {{influence}} on the king <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had in Europe. The nobles, along with the bishops, formed the haute cour (high court), which was responsible for confirming {{the election of a}} new king (or a regent if necessary), collecting taxes, minting coins, allotting money to the king, and raising armies. The haute cour was the only judicial body for the nobles of the kingdom, hearing criminal cases such as murder, rape, and treason, and simpler feudal disputes such as recovery of slaves, sales and purchases of fiefs, and default of service. Punishments included forfeiture of land and exile, or in extreme cases death. The first laws of the kingdom were, according to tradition, established during Godfrey of Bouillon's short reign, but were more probably established by Baldwin II at the Council of Nablus in 1120. Benjamin Z. Kedar argued that the canons of the Council of Nablus were in force in the 12th century but had fallen out of use by the thirteenth. Marwan Nader questions this and suggests that the canons may not have applied to the whole kingdom at all times. The most extensive collection of laws, together known as Assizes of Jerusalem, were written in the mid-13th century, although many of them are purported to be twelfth-century in origin.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the losses under King John and the {{difficulties}} with the burgesses, the priory seems to have enjoyed greater prosperity at this time than at any later period of which we have a clear account. In 1213 the conventual church was dedicated by Bishop Hugh of Wells, a great concourse of earls and barons, abbots and priors, assisting at the ceremony. The lordship of Houghton Regis, though lost {{for a while in}} 1212, was recovered in 1226; and the gift of the church of Bradbourne in the Peak, with its chapels and lands, provided a maintenance for three canons, and formed a kind of cell to the priory, besides increasing its income. The death of Richard de Morins in 1242 was followed immediately by heavy losses. In 1243, 800 of the sheep belonging to the priory in the Peak district died, and a succession of bad seasons led to great scarcity; Henry de Bilenda, the cellarer, upon whom so much depended, was incapable or untrustworthy, and in 1249 fled to the Cistercians at Merivale, rather than render an account of his stewardship. By 1255 the canons not only had no corn to sell, but not enough for themselves; they had to buy all their food at great expense, for two years after this; so that the Friars Preachers, when they arrived in 1259, were even less welcome <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been at any ordinary time.
