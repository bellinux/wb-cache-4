500|$|... "Master Teacher" [...] was {{conceived}} by Georgia Anne Muldrow on her Rhodes piano at Sa-Ra's Cosmic Dust Studio with Badu present and was originally intended {{for one of}} their albums. Its idyllic music blends mellow soul and glitchy hip hop, featuring a chopped sample of Curtis Mayfield's 1972 song [...] "Freddie's Dead". The song's lyrics envision {{a higher degree of}} African-American identity. Its vocalists ask in refrain, [...] "What if there was no niggas, only master teachers?", and answering [...] "I stay woke", with Badu responding [...] "I'm in the search of something new / Search inside me, searching inside you". Midway through the song, Poyser's keyboards lower the music's tempo, with a fluid, jazzy sound. [...] "That Hump" [...] concerns the topic of drug dependency. The closing track [...] "Telephone" [...] is a tribute to J Dilla, who died in 2006 from complications with blood disorder, and has themes of sorrow and hope. It serves as a departure from the preceding songs' edgier musical direction, featuring soft melodies and an acoustic feel similar to Badu's live sound. The song opens with the sound of ominous sirens, referencing J Dilla's 2006 album Donuts. The song's lyrics are based on a story told to Badu by J Dilla's mother on the day of his death. Poyser explained in an interview, [...] "Dilla's mom told Erykah about one day when he was <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> this dream he had where Ol'Dirty was telling him to get on a different color bus and giving him directions home". According to Poyser, the song's music was inspired by Dilla's passing: ...|$|E

2500|$|According {{to another}} version, Duchamp {{did not create}} Fountain, but rather {{assisted}} in submitting the piece to the Society of Independent Artists for a female friend.

Duchamp never identified his collaborator, but two candidates have been proposed: the Dadaist Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, whose scatological aesthetic echoed that of Duchamp, or Louise Norton, who contributed an essay to The Blind Man discussing Fountain. Norton, who recently had separated from her husband, was living {{at the time in}} an apartment owned by her parents at 110 West 88th Street in New York City, and this address is partially discernible (along with [...] "Richard Mutt") on the paper entry ticket attached to the object, as seen in Stieglitz's photograph.|$|E

On the December 12 edition of Impact Wrestling, Joe was unsuccessful in grabbing any of the four cases in a Feast or Fired match against Austin Aries, Chris Sabin, Curry Man, Dewey Barnes, James Storm, Norv Fernum, Gunner, Chavo Guerrero, Zema Ion and Hernandez. On the January 1, 2014 edition of Impact Wrestling, Joe talked to Dixie, <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> what AJ said in regards to having a locker room full of friends. Dixie ignoring what Joe previously said, told him to only focus on his match against her nephew, Ethan Carter III.
