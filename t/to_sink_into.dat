5|$|Bond and Vesper {{travel to}} Venice. M calls Bond {{and tells him}} the money was never deposited. Realising Vesper has stolen it, Bond pursues her and her clients into a {{building}}. The building is damaged in the struggle and begins <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the Grand Canal, with Vesper trapped inside. Bond kills Vesper's clients and attempts to save her, but she refuses his attempts and drowns. White, watching nearby, walks away with the money.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} of Ventus' state, Aqua brings {{his body to}} the Land of Departure, which she transforms into Castle Oblivion to ensure Ventus will not be disturbed. Back at Radiant Garden, Aqua senses Xehanort possessing Terra's body. When Terra tries {{to regain control of}} his body, Xehanort impales himself with his own Keyblade, causing him <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the realm of darkness. Aqua dives into the realm and rescues Terra, but becomes trapped. Ansem the Wise finds Xehanort still possessing Terra's body, while Ventus' heart reconnects with and rests inside the heart of a young Sora.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, nearby nuclear weapons testing by the United States {{military}} accidentally caused {{all of the}} islands of Hy-yi-yi <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the ocean, destroying all traces of the rhinogrades and their unique ecosystem. Also killed were all the world's Rhinogradentia researchers, who were attending a conference on Hy-yi-yi at the time. The book's epilogue, credited to Steiner {{in his capacity as}} the book's illustrator, explains that Stümpke had sent the book's materials to Steiner to {{serve as the basis for}} illustrations in preparation for publication. Following the disaster, it is the only remaining record of the subjects it describes.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, the FNLA and the MPLA, {{based in}} {{neighbouring}} countries, began a guerrilla campaign against Portuguese rule on several fronts. The Portuguese Colonial War, {{which included the}} Angolan War of Independence, lasted until the Portuguese regime's overthrow in 1974 through a leftist military coup in Lisbon. When the timeline for independence became known, most of the roughly 500,000 ethnic Portuguese Angolans fled the territory during the weeks before or after that deadline. Portugal left behind a newly independent country whose population was mainly composed by Ambundu, Ovimbundu, and Bakongo peoples. The Portuguese that lived in Angola accounted {{for the majority of}} the skilled workers in public administration, agriculture, and industry; once they fled the country, the national economy began <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> depression.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into the mud, which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their lower body weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Vegetation {{in most of}} the {{contaminated}} areas adjoining the oil lakes began recovering by 1995, but the dry climate has also partially solidified some of the lakes.

25|$|Output {{sink current}}: The output sink current is the maximum current allowed <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the output stage. Some {{manufacturers}} show the output voltage vs. the output sink current plot, which gives {{an idea of}} the output voltage when it is sinking current from another source into the output pin.|$|E
25|$|Much of Scott's hauling {{was to be}} done by ponies, {{which are}} ill-suited to work on snow and ice without snow-shoes. Their {{relatively}} small hooves and large weight caused them <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> anything other than very firm snow or ice. Oates was opposed to snow-shoes and had left most of them at base camp.|$|E

25|$|Jean Barts 380mm turret {{was quickly}} repaired. On 10 November, Jean Bart opened fire again, and almost hit , the Task Force 34 flagship. In retaliation, bombers from Ranger inflicted severe damage on Jean Bart with two heavy bombs hitting {{the bow and}} the stern, causing the French {{battleship}} <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the harbor mud with decks awash.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{liquefaction}} occurs when, {{because of}} the shaking, water-saturated granular material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid. Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits. For example, in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, soil liquefaction caused many buildings <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1940s, the Waibaidu Bridge has {{undergone}} four major repairs and reinforcements, including {{the most recent}} one in 1999. By 1947, after 40 years of service, the municipal government did a check that revealed weakness in the structure and a tendency <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the ground (12.7cm since 1907). In June 1947, a private company was contracted to reinforce the structure and prevent further sinking. No other major work was done thereafter, except the widening of the walkways for pedestrians after 1949.|$|E

25|$|Money: The money {{system has}} been {{expanded}} upon, compared to previous titles. Players can spend their cash on gambling, clothes, tattoos, meals, etc. Excessive gambling loss can force the player <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> debt, which is shown in red negative numbers. When the player leaves a safehouse, CJ gets an unexpected call and a mysterious person tells him about his debts. Four gang members suddenly appear and shoot Carl on sight {{if he does not}} erase the debt when the mysterious person calls him a second time.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulties}} {{facing the}} Luftwaffe during the Norwegian campaign resurfaced in the Netherlands. The Hague airfields {{were to be}} captured by glider and paratroops, but the Dutch had heavily fortified the area and prepared obstacles to hamper landing attempts. Much of the ground was also soft causing many transports <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the grass making them very vulnerable to enemy artillery fire. The RAF was quickly deployed to the Netherlands to offer support for the ML. Together with Dutch AA, it inflicted heavy losses on the Transportgruppen, 125 Ju 52 in all, were destroyed and 47 damaged, representing 50% of the fleet's strength.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} part of the ritual, the aides seek {{repeatedly}} both to arouse the ritualist sexually as well as to exhaust him. The ritualist is generally passive in this regard. There is disagreement over whether sexual arousal is enough, or sexual orgasm must be eventually accomplished. Crowley and others argue that orgasm must be avoided. Although later practitioners conclude that orgasm does not need to be avoided, that was how Crowley originally formulated the ritual. Most practitioners agree with Crowley that every means of arousal may be used, such as physical stimulation, genital stimulation, psychological stimulation, devices (such as sex toys), or drugs (an entheogen like hashish, marijuana, or other aphrodisiacs). There should be enough aides so that if one aide tires another may take his or her place. Eventually, the ritualist will tend <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> sleep due to exhaustion.|$|E

25|$|The {{sequence}} of events leading to anoxic oceans may have been triggered by carbon dioxide emissions from the eruption of the Siberian Traps. In that scenario, warming from the enhanced greenhouse effect would reduce the solubility of oxygen in seawater, causing the concentration of oxygen to decline. Increased weathering of the continents due to warming and the acceleration of the water cycle would increase the riverine flux of phosphate to the ocean. The phosphate would have supported greater primary productivity in the surface oceans. The increase in organic matter production would have caused more organic matter <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the deep ocean, where its respiration would further decrease oxygen concentrations. Once anoxia became established, {{it would have been}} sustained by a positive feedback loop because deep water anoxia tends to increase the recycling efficiency of phosphate, leading to even higher productivity.|$|E
25|$|After deposition, {{physical}} processes can deform the sediment, producing a third class of secondary structures. Density contrasts between different sedimentary layers, such as between sand and clay, {{can result in}} flame structures or load casts, formed by inverted diapirism. While the clastic bed is still fluid, diapirism can cause a denser upper layer <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> a lower layer. Sometimes, density contrasts can result or grow {{when one of the}} lithologies dehydrates. Clay can be easily compressed as a result of dehydration, while sand retains the same volume and becomes relatively less dense. On the other hand, when the pore fluid pressure in a sand layer surpasses a critical point, the sand can break through overlying clay layers and flow through, forming discordant bodies of sedimentary rock called sedimentary dykes. The same process can form mud volcanoes on the surface where they broke through upper layers.|$|E
25|$|Measures {{other than}} {{drainage}} {{have been implemented}} to contain flooding in the city. In 1950, dikes were built to confine storm runoff. Rivers that run through the city were encapsulated in 1950 and 1951. Rivers such as the Consulado River, Churubusco River and the Remedio River are encased in concrete tunnels which take their waters directly to the drainage system to leave the Valley. Two other rivers, the San Javier and the Tlalnepantla, which used to feed the old lake system, are diverted {{before they reach the}} city and their waters now flow directly into the Grand Canal. None of water from these rivers is allowed <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the ground to recharge the aquifer. While the rivers and streams that flow down from the mountain peaks still begin the way they always have, their passage through the shantytowns lacking city sanitation schemes that surround Mexico City turns them into open combined sewers. Therefore, their final stages are frequently culverted or added to the existing major culverted rivers to keep this water from contaminating the aquifer.|$|E
