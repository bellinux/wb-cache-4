5|$|German {{was first}} {{introduced}} into the curriculum in 1931, the same time at which the school began to offer voluntary after-school art classes. F. H. Taylor attempted to achieve equilibrium in the curriculum between arts and science subjects; he made woodwork and art continuous for an entire term and introduced a geography course for the Higher School Certificate. In 1948 rural biology was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> for the first time, for which the headmaster provided a plot of land {{to be used as}} a vegetable plot. At the end of that year, an after-school study period was introduced; following the seven normal periods (five in the morning, two in the afternoon), students were to either begin their homework, or attend a school society. However, the 1950s saw a definite swing towards maths and science, and a subsequent increase in staffing in those departments. In 1957, zoology and botany was taught at A-level for the first time, and physics and chemistry replaced rural biology at O-level (now replaced by the GCSE).|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} between 1910 and 1920, Auburn High changed from an academy of the classic 19th-century model, {{focusing}} on the traditional Latin course, to a high school offering vocational and technical courses {{in addition to the}} academic offerings. Auburn High added vocational courses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> in 1918, the eighth high school in the state to implement such a program. Over the next two decades, Auburn High developed its modern extracurricular face, forming band, choir, drama, and other programs, as well as diversifying occupational classes. In 1925, Auburn High {{became one of the first}} high schools in the state to be accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. A new school building was constructed in 1931, and in 1956, the school was officially renamed Auburn High School.|$|E

This research aims to investigate teachers’ readiness and competence <b>to</b> implement <b>the</b> 2013 <b>Curriculum,</b> particularly viewed from their comprehension about the syllabus of English subject and its development into lesson plans based on the principles of syllabus development as suggested in <b>the</b> <b>curriculum,</b> as well as their ability and their self-efficacy in implementing <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> in classroom teaching and learning processes. Twelve senior high school teachers from different schools were assigned to complete a questionnaire about their readiness and competence <b>to</b> implement <b>the</b> 2013 <b>curriculum</b> and were observed in their teaching and learning process. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis were employed in the research. Results from quantitative analysis showed that teachers’ readiness <b>to</b> implement <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> had low correlation on their competence. Qualitative analysis revealed that teachers had adequate readiness <b>to</b> implement <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> and competence <b>to</b> develop lesson planning. For further studies, studies on the aspects of teachers’ attitude, motivation, belief, and commitment <b>to</b> implement <b>the</b> 2013 <b>curriculum</b> need <b>to</b> be further investigated...|$|R
