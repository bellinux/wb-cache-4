2500|$|Jackson {{repeatedly}} {{called for}} {{the abolition of the}} Electoral College by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to Congress as President. In his third annual message to Congress, he expressed the view [...] "I have heretofore recommended amendments of the Federal Constitution giving the election of President and Vice-President to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term. So important do I consider these changes in our fundamental law <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not,</b> in accordance with my sense of duty, omit to press them upon the consideration of a new Congress." ...|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{expansion}} of the game throughout the country, there has been much more attention placed into the eventual reestablishment of the program. However, similar to the reasons for disbandment, money still remains an issue. As stated by current NC State Athletic Director Debbie Yow, “I have a personal appreciation for the sport of lacrosse. <b>That</b> said, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> foresee a time when we would voluntarily add any sport. The current 23 varsity sports need and deserve our attention and financial support.” ...|$|R

Using the knife, <b>I</b> find <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> capture <b>not</b> only the softness of clouds, but also the boldness of mountains, the vibrancy of flowers, {{and the strength of}} water.

60|$|But {{what most}} {{astonished}} me, and seemed most incredible, was the infernal opinion of Jackson, {{that the man}} had been actually dead when brought on board the ship; and that knowingly, and merely {{for the sake of the}} month's advance, paid into his hand upon the strength of the bill he presented, the body-snatching crimp had knowingly shipped a corpse on board of the Highlander, under the pretense of its being a live body in a drunken trance. And I heard Jackson say, that he had known of such things having been done before. But that a really dead body ever burned in <b>that</b> manner, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> even yet believe.

60|$|The {{following}} is an argument of Descartes to prove, in his a priori manner, the being of a God. The conception, says he, of an infinite Being proves the real existence of such a being. For {{if there is not}} really any such being, I must have made the conception; but if I could make it, I can also unmake it; which evidently is not true; therefore there must be, externally to myself, an archetype, from which the conception was derived. In this argument (which, it may be observed, would equally prove the real existence of ghosts and of witches) the ambiguity is in the pronoun I, by which, in one place, is to be understood my will, in another the laws of my nature. If the conception, existing as it does in my mind, had no original without, the conclusion would unquestionably follow that I made it; that is, the laws of my nature must have somehow evolved it: but that my will made it, would not follow. Now when Descartes afterward adds <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> unmake the conception, he means <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> get rid of it by an act of my will: which is true, but is not the proposition required. I can as much unmake this conception as I can any other: no conception which I have once had, can I ever dismiss by mere volition; but what some of the laws of my nature have produced, other laws, or those same laws in other circumstances, may, and often do, subsequently efface.|$|E

60|$|Yes, both {{of those}} old people thought that that tale was pathetic; whereas to my mind it was purely ridiculous, and {{not in any way}} {{valuable}} to any one.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{structure}} of nuese 2 ̆ 7 s recognition of difficulty on nursing approach. This study considers the recognition of difficulty on nursing approach based on nurse-patient relationship. The subjects of this study were 16 psychiatric nurses. They were interviewed about nursing process for the patient that they feel difficulty. As a result, the structure of nurse 2 ̆ 7 s recognition of difficulty on nursing approach consisted of 6 categories was clarified. The structure was as follows. Patient that nurses feel difficulty on nursing approach has [A. unsettled, inpulsive and manipulative character]. Nurses react with [B. negative feeling and anxiety] and think <b>that</b> [C. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> understand this patient]. And then some nurses [D. make efforts to change their way of approach]. Others [E. give up changing]. Sometimes nurses feel [F. helplessness and dissatisfaction about other staff]. These finding led important suggestions to overcome the recognition of difficulty on nursing approach. 本研究は,看護者が感じる働きかけの困難さを看護者・患者関係における問題として捉え,働きかけの困難さの認識の構造を明らかにすることを目的とした。 16 人の精神科看護者に,働きかけの困難さを感じる患者とのかかわりについてインタビューを行い,語られた内容から働きかけの困難さの認識に関係する患者および看護者の言動と,看護者の感情や認識を抽出してKJ法を用いて分析した。その結果,看護者の働きかけの困難さの認識は, 6 つのラベルで表わされるまとまりが関係する構造として,以下のように表わされた。看護者は,[A. 衝動的で不安定であり,対人関係において操作的であるために孤立しがちな患者の特徴]を捉え,[B. 患者に対する否定的な感情と強い不安]を感じ[C. 患者のことがわからないと捉え]ていた。そして看護者は,[D. 患者の言動の本当の意味を考え,対応を工夫して関係を良くしようとする]が,その一方で[E. 患者の性格や相性に問題があると捉えて深入りしない]という態度をとることもある。また[F. 看護者の無力感や他のスタッフに対する不満]が生じることがあった。これらの結果から,看護者が働きかけの困難さの認識を乗り越えるために重要な示唆が導き出された...|$|R
