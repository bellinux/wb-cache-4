5|$|H. G. Wells' 1898 novel The War of The Worlds {{included}} a chaotic rush to board trains at Liverpool Street as the Martian machines overran military defences in the West End, and described <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> of {{people under the}} wheels of the steam engines.|$|E
5|$|After the king's victory, {{one of his}} loyal adherents, Thomas Szécsényi was {{appointed}} voivode who suppressed a Saxon revolt in 1324. At that time, the autonomous Saxon province was divided into seats, each administered by a judge appointed by the king. In appreciation of the Transylvanian noblemen's services in <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> of the revolt, Charles I exempted them from the taxes they had so far paid to the voivodes.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> and crushee {{arrive at}} the {{location}} of the date, the crushee leaves <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> ready for their date. On most stories, <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> will then call back the crushee and then say that the blind date is really between <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> and <b>the</b> crushee. The crushee will then respond to the crusher's feelings. Very rarely, <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> gets cold feet and allows the crushee to walk away.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Crusher</b> has no driving {{controls}} {{because it is}} autonomous. Instead, the operators drive <b>the</b> <b>Crusher</b> with video game controllers. While driving between its waypoints via GPS, <b>the</b> <b>Crusher</b> continuously attempts to find the fastest and easiest path to its destination. For example, if it encounters an object more than 6 ft high or a gorge more than 6 ft deep, <b>the</b> <b>Crusher</b> {{will find a way}} around it.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> [...] Colorado <b>Crush</b> {{season was}} <b>the</b> {{eleventh}} {{season for the}} professional indoor football franchise and ninth in the Indoor Football League (IFL). It was the second season of the franchise being labeled <b>the</b> <b>Crush</b> after playing nine seasons under the Ice moniker. <b>The</b> <b>Crush</b> were one of ten teams that competed in the IFL for the 2017 season. <b>The</b> <b>Crush</b> {{were members of the}} Intense Conference.|$|R
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> {{of the two}} revolutions, {{a number}} of Brabant and Liège revolutionaries regrouped in Paris, where they formed the joint Committee of United Belgians and Liégois (Comité des belges et liégeois unis), which united revolutionaries from both territories for the first time. Three Belgian corps and a Liège Legion were levied to {{continue}} the fight for the French against the Austrians.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} analysis, {{it made no}} difference; Fletcher's {{carriers}} had launched their planes beginning at 07:00 (with Enterprise and Hornet having completed launching by 07:55, but Yorktown not until 09:08), so the aircraft that would deliver <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> blow were already on their way. Even if Nagumo had not strictly followed carrier doctrine, {{he could not have}} prevented the launch of the American attack.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of refugees were motivated by economic concerns and sought to improve their living conditions and opportunities by migrating to the West. Events such as <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> of the 1953 uprising, the imposition of collectivisation and East Germany's final economic crisis in the late 1980s prompted surges {{in the number of}} escape attempts.|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of a crayfish medial giant axon to a nerve crush is examined with a biomagnetic current probe. The experimental data is interpreted with a theoretical model that incorporates both radial and axial ionic transport and membrane kinetics {{similar to those}} in the Hodgkin/Huxley model. Our experiments show that the effects of <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> are manifested statically as an elevation of the resting potential and dynamically as a reduction in the amplitude of the action current and potential, and are observable up to 10 mm from <b>the</b> <b>crush.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> normally biphasic action current becomes monophasic near <b>the</b> <b>crush.</b> <b>The</b> model reflects these observations accurately, and based on the experimental data, it predicts that <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> seals with a time constant of 45 s. The injury current density entering the axon through <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> is calculated to be initially on the order of 0. 1 mA/mm 2 and may last until <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> seals or until the concentration gradients between the intra- and extracellular spaces equilibrate...|$|R

5|$|The Uprising and its {{repression}} caused {{trauma that}} continues to manifest in the Malagasy population. Many Malagasy nationals fought each other and struggle to reconcile themselves to the remorse and guilt. Healing {{at the national level}} is further {{complicated by the fact that}} the same leaders who proclaimed Madagascar's independence in 1960 were those who had been major players in the PADESM political party, which had been favored by the colonial administration after <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> of the revolt.|$|E
5|$|The {{recycling}} {{facility and}} museum was constructed for {{a cost of}} $5 million and opened in 1993. Funding for the museum was provided through a group of 19 local municipalities, known as the Southwest Connecticut Recycling Committee, which transported recyclables to the facility for processing. The museum {{was part of an}} active recycling operation that allows visitors to follow the recyclable materials through the sorting processes to <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> and baling process before they are shipped to processors to be recycled into new products. The museum was overseen and operated by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority.|$|E
5|$|In August 1968, the Polish People's Army {{took part}} in the Warsaw Pact {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia. Some Polish intellectuals protested, and Ryszard Siwiec burned himself alive during the official national holiday celebrations. The Polish participation in <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> of the Czech liberal communism (called socialism with a human face, and, according to David Ost, constituting the crowning achievement of Marxist revisionism) further alienated Gomułka from his former liberal supporters. But within the party, the opposition to Gomułka faded and the 5th Congress of the PZPR in November reconfirmed his rule. Brezhnev, who attended the gathering, used the occasion to expound his Brezhnev Doctrine, a self-granted Soviet right to forcefully intervene if an allied state strays too far from the fraternal course.|$|E

5|$|Many historians {{maintain}} {{that given the}} massive reductions in US military aid to South Vietnam after 1973, any major PAVN offensive was bound to succeed. However, the ARVN's soldiers were hardened veterans, and South Vietnam maintained vast stockpiles of ammunition and equipment (as demonstrated by the massive quantities of war materiel captured by the PAVN when the war ended). The final collapse of the ARVN {{may well have been}} inevitable, but the end would have been much bloodier and much longer in coming had the PAVN chosen a more direct, conventional plan of attack. In fact, the most damaging blow of the entire PAVN campaign may have been <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> psychological blow their skillful and unexpected strategy dealt to the mind of the ARVN's commander-in-chief.|$|E
5|$|Team Razer was {{acknowledged}} {{for having}} devised and popularised <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> and piercing arm weapon. Razer's success spawned {{a number of}} imitations: SuicidalTendencies, Ming3 and Tiberius are amongst the other heavyweight robots to have adopted such a weapon, whilst the featherweight robot Venom is a scaled-down replica of Razer. In 2001, Razer appeared in cartoon form on the front cover of the seventeenth issue of Robot Wars Magazine. It was {{also included in the}} Robot Wars video games. The version of Razer which competed in the fourth series of Robot Wars was used as the model for a pull-back toy powered by friction motors. This was sold alongside a model stunt ramp and barrels. A small metal toy based on Razer was available as part of the Robot Wars minibots range and, alongside Chaos 2 and Hypno-Disc, Razer was one of three competitor robots chosen to appear on a personalised DVD as part of the Robot Wars Ultimate Warrior Collection series.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{surrendered}} {{cities were}} allowed complete autonomy {{in exchange for}} payment of the kharaj poll-tax. Following the death of Emperor John V Palaiologos in 1391, however, Manuel II escaped Ottoman custody and went to Constantinople, where he was crowned emperor, succeeding his father. This angered Sultan Bayezid I, who laid waste to the remaining Byzantine territories, and then turned on Chrysopolis, which was captured by storm and largely destroyed. Thessalonica too submitted again to Ottoman rule at this time, possibly after brief resistance, but was treated more leniently: although the city was brought under full Ottoman control, the Christian population and the Church retained most of their possessions, and the city retained its institutions. Thessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until 1403, when Emperor Manuel II sided with Bayezid's eldest son Süleyman in the Ottoman succession struggle that broke out following <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> defeat and capture of Bayezid at the Battle of Ankara against Tamerlane in 1402. In exchange for his support, in the Treaty of Gallipoli the Byzantine emperor secured the return of Thessalonica, part of its hinterland, the Chalcidice peninsula, and the coastal region between the rivers Strymon and Pineios.|$|E

50|$|Other times, the crushee {{will agree}} to the date. In these shows, <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> will usually be very happy and show his or her joy to the camera. Then, the date will be shown. Not all dates wind up well. Some crushees have agreed to dates to be nice even though they really had no romantic {{feelings}} for <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> and usually wind up mentioning the truth during or after the date, hurting the crusher's feelings. Other times, the date goes well and a relationship starts between <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> and <b>the</b> crushee. In some cases, the crushee will already have romantic feelings for <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> but was also too scared to express his or her feelings as well.|$|R

5|$|The {{deepening}} {{economic crisis}} caused a marked deterioration in {{quality of life}} of ordinary citizens and resulted in increasing political instability. Rationing and queuing became a way of life, with ration cards (kartki) necessary to buy basic consumer staples. The ration cards were utilized by the government in order to avoid allowing market regulation of income and prices and thus risking social unrest. As Western institutions were no longer willing to extend credit policies to the de facto bankrupt Polish government, access to goods the Poles needed became even more restricted. Most of the available scarce resources of Western currency had to be used to pay <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> rates on Poland's foreign debt, which reached US$27 billion by 1980 and increased to US$45 billion in 1989. The government, which controlled all official foreign trade, responded by continuing to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing black market {{and the development of a}} shortage economy. The omnipresent and destructive underground economy was characterized by phenomena such as bribery, waiting lists, speculation, direct exchanges between enterprises and large percentages of personal incomes deriving from secondary activities. Societal degradation was accompanied by unprecedented deterioration in the areas of biological environment and physical and mental health, which included steadily increasing mortality rates. In the late 1980s, the PZPR feared another social explosion because of high inflation, depressed living standards and deepening public anger and frustration. The authorities themselves, facing an increasingly disorderly and unmanageable system, felt perplexed and powerless.|$|E

25|$|In {{the single}} toggle jaw crushers, the swing jaw is {{suspended}} on the eccentric shaft {{which leads to}} a much more compact design than that of the double toggle jaw crusher. The swing jaw, suspended on the eccentric, undergoes two types of motion- swing motion towards the fixed jaw due to the action of toggle plate and vertical movement due the rotation of the eccentric. These two motions, when combined, lead to an elliptical jaw motion. This motion is useful as it assists in pushing the particles through <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> chamber. This phenomenon leads to higher capacity of the single toggle jaw crushers but it also results in higher wear of <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> jaws. These type of jaw crushers are preferred for <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> of softer particles.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Crusher</b> later {{appeared}} as a professional wrestler in 1951's Bunny Hugged (directed by Chuck Jones). After he defeats Ravishing Ronald, <b>the</b> <b>Crusher</b> faces off against Bugs Bunny as the Masked Terror. When <b>the</b> <b>Crusher</b> gets Bugs in a leg-scissors move, Bugs resorts to some strategy where he makes <b>the</b> <b>Crusher</b> think he ripped his trunks. Posing as a tailor named Stychen Time, Bugs jabs a needle in the Crusher's backside causing him to fly screaming through <b>the</b> audience. <b>The</b> <b>Crusher</b> then comes charging back, but Bugs opens a safe door letting Crusher run through it and bounce off the ring ropes before being slung back into the now closed door. A now disoriented Crusher is able to be pinned (literally, as Bugs put a coat on Crusher, gets him to lie down and pins the coat's shoulders to the mat). When the match ends and Bugs is declared <b>the</b> new champion, <b>Crusher</b> snaps out of it. He offers his hand to shake Bugs', despite the crowd's objections causing <b>the</b> <b>Crusher</b> to merely growl them into silence). Bugs relents and when Crusher tries to bite Bugs' arm he's instead biting through a stick of dynamite, which blows up in his face.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} shows {{that it is possible}} for cattle feeders to obtain additional profits if a consistent technical strategy for trading is applied to <b>the</b> cattle <b>crush</b> spread. However, when trading costs are introduced, the likelihood of obtaining profit from trading <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> reduces considerably. It also shows that the level of gains from <b>the</b> cattle <b>crush</b> is related to the month the cattle are marketed. When <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> is used as a hedging strategy it decreases the profit from the feeding operation and reduces the volatility of those returns, helping producers to transfer part of the price risk associated with their production. To provide evidence of these findings, this study utilizes daily prices for 1995 to 2006 of the futures contracts of corn, feeder and live cattle to construct <b>the</b> daily cattle <b>crush</b> spread for two different combination of futures contracts. These contract combinations suppose that cattle are fed in feedlots for 170 days before being marketed in April and in October. Two different scenarios are also evaluated using <b>the</b> cattle <b>crush</b> spread: one in which <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> is employed as a pre-placement hedging tool and another in which <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> is used as a post-placement hedging method...|$|R

25|$|Nowadays {{there are}} some crusher buckets with a {{patented}} technology which can achieve a higher productivity (Xcentric Crusher). They are manufactured with a high inertia power train, circular jaw movement and an antiestagnation plate, which prevents large shredding pieces from getting stuck in the bucket's mouth, not allowing them to enter <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> jaws. They have also <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> jaws placed in a cross position. This position together with its circular motion gives these crusher buckets the faculty of grinding wet material.|$|E
