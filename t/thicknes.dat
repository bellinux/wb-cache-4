However, none {{has been able}} to automate the segmentation process. This paper describes a fast, automatic, modelbased approach to segmentation and thickness measurement of the femoral cartilage in 3 D T 1 -weighted images using Active Shape Models (ASMs). Systematic experiments were performed to assess the accuracy and precision of the technique with in vivo images of both normal and abnormal knees. Segmentation accuracy was determined by comparing the results of the segmentation with the boundaries delineated by a radiologist. The mean error in locating the boundary was 0. 57 pixels. To assess the precision of the measurement technique, the mean thickness of the femoral cartilage was calculated for repeated scans of five normal volunteers.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of channel gains {{is a widely}} used method for determining properties of substances. A common way of performing this measurement is by sending a harmonic signal with known amplitude through the substance followed by a filtering of the received signal, which yields an estimation of the channel gain, and hence a quantification of an unknown substance property. These types of signals are unfortunately sensitive to various kinds of noise, making robust implementations di#cult. The wavelet transform, being fast and highly adaptable, is proposed {{as a tool for}} making these estimation robust. This paper demonstrates that by combining a series of carefully designed signals and the versatility of the wavelet transform, it is possible, with low computational complexity, to make robust estimations of channel gains.

40|$|In {{order for}} sub- 10 nm thin films of ZrO 2 {{to have a}} {{dielectric}} constant larger than 30 {{they need to be}} crystalline. This is done by either depositing the layer at higher temperatures or by a postdeposition annealing step. Both methods induce high leakage currents in ZrO 2 based dielectrics. In order to understand the leakage a thickness series of ultrathin ZrO 2 and nanolaminate ZrO 2 / Al 2 O 3 / ZrO 2 (ZAZ) films, deposited by atomic layer deposition, was investigated. After deposition these films were subjected to different rapid thermal annealing (RTA) processes. Grazing incidence x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy yield that the crystallization of ZrO 2 during deposition is dependent on film thickness and on the presence of an Al 2 O 3 sublayer. Moreover, the incorporation of Al 2 O 3 prevents crystallites from spanning across the entire film during RTA. C-V and I-V spectroscopies show that after a 650 °C RTA in N 2 the capacitance equivalent oxide <b>thickne</b> ss of 10 nm ZAZ films is reduced to 1. 0 nm while maintaining low leakage currents of 3. 2 × 10 - 8 A/ cm 2 at 1 V.

However, after crystallization, the currents at crystallite grain boundaries are increased in ZrO 2 and ZAZ films...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years we {{reported}} in general about the hollow-cathode activated deposition of oxides on plastic films (HAD process). This paper describes the process and its possible variations in more detail. As a first variant we investigated the horizontal hollow-cathode discharge with two different anode configurations. A row of hollow-cathode systems arranged side by side across the web creates a dense plasma shield that is located directly below the substrate. Al 2 O 3 coatings deposited via this plasma shield show a clear improvement of microstructure, hardness and abrasion resistance. A further remarkable improvement of the Al 2 O 3 properties can be attained by a vertical hollow-cathode discharge between the aforementioned plasma shield near the substrate and an anode {{in the vicinity of}} the evaporator crucible. The electrical field in this vertical plasma discharge causes additional ions to move toward the substrate. As a result, non-columnar Al 2 O 3, coatings of some micrometers <b>thickne</b> ss with high density and outstanding abrasion resistance have been produced. Despite of the successful deposition of Al 2 O 3 layers by plasma-activated reactive EB evaporation of Al we recommend to use EB evaporation preferably for such materials that really need this technique. This holds especially for the deposition of SiO 2, TiO 2, or ZrO 2 layers. For the deposition of Al 2 O 3 layers we recommend the reactive Al evaporation via boat evaporators in combination with the vertical HAD process. The installation of the necessary hollow-cathode systems including monitoring and oxygen supply in conventional aluminum roll coaters is possible...|$|R

40|$|The glass {{addition}} in {{a silver}} paste has a key role for the adhesion of the silver track, on one hand, and for a homogeneous formation of an interfacial microstructure showing a sufficient number and size of silver precipitates, on the other hand. In our study, time and temperature dependencies of the sintering density and formation of interfacial layers were examined by interrupted firings of metallized wafers. The cross sections of intermediate states of the sintered microstructures of the model pastes were visualized by focused ion beam preparation and SEM. While the silver finger becomes densified a distinct fraction of the paste glass reacts at the interface in terms of silver dissolution, transport, precipitation and emitter etching, while the layer is growing continuously in <b>thickne</b> ss. Thereby, the ohmic resistivity of the glassy interface layer is simultaneously lowered by Ag-precipitation and increased by thickness. The P-doped emitter layer is partly etched by the reactive glass melt at the interface. In other words, the contact resistivity of the P-doped silicon surface is increased continuously. The specific contact resistivity of the interface {{can be referred to}} as a superposition of the specific resistances of the silver enriched glassy interface layer and the etched, phosphor doped Si-surface. By optimizing powder geometry, silver densification characteristics and sinter onset of the glass phase it is possible to control the active amount of paste glass at the interface paste/wafer.
