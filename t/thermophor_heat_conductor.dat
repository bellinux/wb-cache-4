40|$|For rigid <b>heat</b> <b>conductors,</b> the {{constitutive}} equation {{of the heat}} flux is usually assumed to be independent of the deformation of the body, or equivalently by setting the deformation gradient as the identity tensor in the {{constitutive equation}}s. However, the notion of material symmetry would have involved change of reference configurations, hence also change of deformation gradients. Consequently {{it would be impossible}} to consider anisotropic rigid <b>heat</b> <b>conductors</b> from such a formulation. In this paper, rigid <b>heat</b> <b>conductors</b> are treated with rigidity as internal constraint and a constitutive theory consistent with the principle of material frame indifference, material symmetry, and the entropy principle is presented.

40|$|The {{model of}} a rigid linear <b>heat</b> <b>conductor</b> with memory is analyzed. Specifically, an {{evolution}} problem which describes the time evolution of the temperature distribution within a rigid <b>heat</b> <b>conductor</b> with memory is studied. The attention is focussed on the thermodynamical state of such a rigid <b>heat</b> <b>conductor</b> which, according to the adopted constitutive equations, depends {{on the history of}} the material; indeed, the dependence of the heat flux {{on the history of the}} temperature's gradient is modeled via an integral term. Thus, the evolution problem under investigation is an integro-differential one with assigned initial and boundary conditions.

Specifically, an evolution problem which describes the time evolution of the temperature distribution within a rigid <b>heat</b> <b>conductor</b> with memory is studied.

When initial and boundary conditions are assigned, the evolution problem turns out to be an integro-differential one whose kernel depends on time through the present time as well as the past history of the material. Hence, the choice of suitable expressions of the minimum free energy and of the thermal work [1] is crucial in studying evolution problems in materials with memory. Indeed, the functional spaces where solutions are looked for, are obtained by the requirement to be meaningful both under the physical as well as the analytic viewpoint.
