5000|$|This type of {{nail polish}} is a clear, milky-colored, or opaque pink polish formula {{that is used}} {{specifically}} before applying <b>nail</b> polish <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nail.</b> [...] <b>The</b> purpose of it is <b>to</b> strengthen <b>nails,</b> restore moisture <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nail,</b> and/or help polish adhere <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nail.</b> Some base coats are marketed as [...] "ridge fillers" [...] which can create a smooth surface, and reduce {{the appearance of the}} ridges that can appear on unbuffed nails.|$|R

60|$|The {{chestnut}} seller, {{turning up}} {{the collar of his}} coat, told him he should probably be moving shortly, as he {{thought it was going to}} snow. Indeed, the evening was growing grey and bitter, but Angus, with all his eloquence, proceeded <b>to</b> <b>nail</b> <b>the</b> chestnut man <b>to</b> his post.|$|R

5000|$|... "I lost {{my brother}} in the Bali bombings {{and the lack of}} support from the {{government}} was colossal. I had to wade through 200 corpses in the baking sun to find my brother.

6000|$|... "Come, let us get the box," [...] said Ham, {{and then}} he and Carl hurried down to the barn, where they found the flat box.

Morales sees Marzin as important to making a case against the terrorists.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{state that}} Ellen White {{interpreted}} [...] {{as saying that}} the ceremonial law was <b>nailed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cross. However, Ellen's White's statements clearly indicate that the only aspects of the law that were <b>nailed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cross were those things that specifically pointed forward to his sacrifice (e.g., animal sacrifices). These typical rituals were done away with when type met anti-type in the death of Christ. The other elements of the law of Moses that did not point specifically to Christ were not <b>nailed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cross. Scholars today typically understand the Greek word cheirographon which was <b>nailed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cross to be the record of sin.|$|R
50|$|Warts of {{this kind}} often cause damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> either by lifting <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> from <b>the</b> skin or causing <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> <b>to</b> {{partially}} detach. If they extend under <b>the</b> <b>nail,</b> then <b>the</b> patient may suffer pain as a result. Sometimes periungual wart infections resemble {{the changes that are}} found in onychomycosis. In worst cases, if the infection causes injury or damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> matrix, deformity in <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> may become permanent.|$|R
50|$|Ngô Quyền {{ordered his}} {{soldiers}} <b>to</b> <b>nail</b> <b>the</b> iron-headed poles under {{the waters of}} the Bạch Đằng river.

When the tide was down, the enemy's boats would be stranded, and be easy targets for attack.|$|R

5000|$|Fiber cement {{cladding}} is a {{very heavy}} product and requires two people to carry the uncut sheets. Thin fiber cement cladding is fragile before installation and must be handled carefully; it is prone to chipping and breakage if improperly handled.

5000|$|He was nicknamed [...] "one-take Timmy" [...] due <b>to</b> <b>nailing</b> <b>the</b> {{emotional}} {{truth of}} the text so quickly, such as crying loudly or delivering a line with a quiver in his voice. Comparing this film to the sequels, where a high note was dubbed by another singer due to being off-key, Olivier noted that in this film {{it would have been}} kept in due to being part of the character.|$|R
50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{explained that}} Batara Guru (Shiva) ordered the god Brahma and Vishnu {{to fill the}} island of Java with human beings. However at that time Java island was floating freely on the ocean, ever tumbling and always shaking. To make the island still, <b>the</b> gods decided <b>to</b> <b>nail</b> <b>the</b> island upon the earth by moving a part of Mahameru in Jambudvipa (India) and attaching it upon Java.|$|R
60|$|He trembled so that {{he could}} hardly spread the {{remaining}} quilts over the dead face. The box was wide enough to receive the stiff, curved right arm, and {{he had nothing to do}} but <b>to</b> <b>nail</b> <b>the</b> cover on, which he did in feverish haste. Then he rose, grasped his tools, rushed outside, slammed the door, and set off in great speed across the snow, pushed on by an indescribable horror.|$|R
50|$|The {{solution}} is to empty the box of thumbtacks, use <b>the</b> thumbtacks <b>to</b> <b>nail</b> <b>the</b> box <b>to</b> the wall, put the candle into the box, and light the candle with the match. The concept of functional fixedness predicts that the participant will only see the box as a device to hold the thumbtacks and not immediately perceive it as a separate and functional component available {{to be used in}} solving the task.|$|R
5000|$|In 1887, French {{geographer}} Élisée Reclus {{details the}} burials in Romania: [...] "if the deceased has red hair, {{he is very}} concerned that {{he was back in}} the form of dog, frog, flea or bedbug, and that it enters into houses at night to suck the blood of beautiful young girls. So it is prudent <b>to</b> <b>nail</b> <b>the</b> coffin heavily, or, better yet, a stake through the chest of the corpse. [...] " ...|$|R
60|$|There was a stillness. He stood {{leaning on}} his sword, his chest heaving with his panting breaths. He was {{naturally}} as fleet as the swift-footed Achilles, but the winter had told upon him, and the haste with which he had rushed to the rescue left him breathless and speechless, while he seemed as it were <b>to</b> <b>nail</b> <b>the</b> two lads <b>to</b> the spot by his steady gaze of mingled distress and displeasure.|$|R

50|$|Another {{treatment}} for chronic nail biters, {{is using a}} dental deterrent device that disables the front teeth from making any damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nails</b> and <b>the</b> surrounding cuticles. After about two months the device leads to a full oppression of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> biting urge.|$|R
5000|$|In 1945 Hesseltine wrote ““Writing {{intellectual}} history {{is like trying}} <b>to</b> <b>nail</b> jelly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall.” ...|$|R
50|$|Washington {{threatened}} in the ninth. Ossie Bluege, {{the only man}} reliever Claude Jonnard faced, drew a bases-loaded walk to make it 6-4. Mule Watson then came in <b>to</b> <b>nail</b> down <b>the</b> last two outs.|$|R
2500|$|Danny Way clipped his shins {{on the lip}} of the quarterpipe after a 20+ foot freefall {{during the}} Big Air competition, which the {{commentators}} refer to as the [...] "second worst fall ever at the X Games" [...] (the first being Jake Brown's the year before).
