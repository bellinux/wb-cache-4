40|$|A {{sample of}} 60 {{respondents}} {{was drawn from}} the population of students of the third grade of primary school in Nis, aged nine ± 6 months, male, who attend regular physical education classes. Subsample of 30 respondents worked on speed and strength development through elementary games at additional physical education classes (experimental group), while the control group had only regular physical education classes defined by primary school curriculum. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effects of work on speed and strength development within the framework of extra physical education classes in the third grade. Tests for the assessment of speed implied six tests: running at 20, 40 and 60 meters, hand <b>tapping,</b> <b>foot</b> <b>tapping</b> and <b>feet</b> <b>tapping</b> on the wall; tests for the assessment of strength implied five tests: push-ups, back lifting, squats, trunk lifting on Swedish bench and trunk lifting for 30 seconds. For determining the effects multivariate analysis of covariance was applied. The results indicated statistically significant effect of the work on the experimental group in both motor dimensions.   </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an initial {{investigation}} of <b>foot</b> <b>tapping</b> {{as a mechanism}} for interacting with a mobile device without removing it from a pocket. We compare a <b>foot</b> <b>tapping</b> technique for menu interaction with two more traditional situations: one where the user has the phone in hand, and one where the user must remove it from an inside pocket before interacting. Results show that {{over the course of}} the full study, all conditions allowed a high level of accuracy in selections. The visual and in pocket conditions were overall faster and more accurate. However, for short selections requiring four or less <b>foot</b> <b>taps</b> or button presses the <b>foot</b> <b>tap</b> condition was faster than the in pocket condition...|$|R

5000|$|The accompaniment {{consists}} of guitar, tapping, and birdsong overdub. The tapping [...] "has been incorrectly {{identified as a}} metronome in the past", according to engineer Geoff Emerick, who says it is actually the sound of Paul <b>tapping</b> his <b>foot,</b> which Emerick recalls as being mic'd up separately. Footage included in the bonus content on disc two of the 2009 remaster of the album shows McCartney <b>tapping</b> both his <b>feet</b> alternately while performing the song.|$|R

2500|$|One therapy model {{based on}} {{neuroscience}}, called [...] "neurological music therapy" [...] (NMT), is [...] "based on a neuroscience model of music perception and production, {{and the influence}} of music on functional changes in non-musical brain and behavior functions". In other words, NMT studies how the brain is without music, how the brain is with music, measures the differences, and uses these differences to cause changes in the brain through music that will eventually affect the client non-musically. As Michael Thaut put it: [...] "The brain that engages in music is changed by engaging in music." [...] NMT trains motor responses (i.e. <b>tapping</b> <b>foot</b> or fingers, head movement, etc.) to better help clients develop motor skills that help [...] "entrain the timing of muscle activation patterns".|$|R
