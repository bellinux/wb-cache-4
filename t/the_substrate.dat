5|$|Burrowing behaviour, {{in which}} an {{individual}} sinks itself entirely (or partially) into <b>the</b> <b>substrate,</b> is frequent among strombid gastropods. The burrowing behaviour of L.canarium consists {{of a series of}} movements characteristic of the species. There are three consecutive movements: first is probing, where the animal pushes the anterior portion of the foot into <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> to gain a hold; next is shovelling, where it pushes <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> with its long, extensible proboscis. Retraction is the final movement, where it moves the shell along an anterior-posterior axis to settle <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> around it. Once burrowed, part of the dorsal shell is usually still visible (although the ventral surface and the animal's soft parts are buried).|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Daniel Koshland {{suggested}} a modification to {{the lock and}} key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> as <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> interacts with the enzyme. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> does not simply bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid side-chains {{that make up the}} active site are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as glycosidases, <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site. The active site continues to change until <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge distribution is determined.|$|E
5|$|In {{competitive}} inhibition, <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> and inhibitor cannot bind to {{the enzyme}} {{at the same}} time, {{as shown in the}} figure on the right. This usually results from the inhibitor having an affinity for the active site of an enzyme where <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> also binds; <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> and inhibitor compete for access to the enzyme's active site. This type of inhibition can be overcome by sufficiently high concentrations of substrate (Vmax remains constant), i.e., by out-competing the inhibitor. However, the apparent Km will increase as it takes a higher concentration of <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> to reach the Km point, or half the Vmax. Competitive inhibitors are often similar in structure to the real substrate (see examples below).|$|E

5|$|Lobatus gigas has {{an unusual}} means of locomotion, first {{described}} in 1922 by George Howard Parker (1864–1955).
