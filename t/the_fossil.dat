5|$|Not every {{transitional}} form {{appears in}} <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> record, because <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> record is not complete. Organisms are only rarely preserved as fossils {{in the best}} of circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered. Paleontologist Donald Prothero noted that this is illustrated {{by the fact that the}} number of species known through <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> record was less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived.|$|E
5|$|The Czerkases {{contacted}} paleontologist Phil Currie, who {{contacted the}} National Geographic Society. Currie agreed to study <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> {{on condition that}} it was eventually returned to China. The National Geographic Society intended to get <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> formally published in the peer-reviewed science journal Nature, and then follow up immediately with a press conference and an issue of National Geographic. Editor Bill Allen asked that {{all members of the}} project keep <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> secret, so that the magazine would have a scoop on the story.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fossil</b> record {{includes}} {{well documented}} examples of phyletic gradualism and punctuational evolution. As such, much debate persists over {{the prominence of}} stasis in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> record.|$|E
50|$|Protosalvinia is a prehistoric plant found {{commonly}} in shale from shoreline habitats of the Upper Devonian period. The name Protosalvinia is a misnomer. The name literally means early Salvinia, and {{was given}} in the erroneous belief that <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> were an earlier form of the living aquatic fern Salvinia. It is no longer believed that <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> come from a fern, but deciding exactly what <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> represent is still a matter of debate. This is surprising when one considers how much is known about <b>the</b> <b>fossils.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{island has}} <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> of dinosaur eggs, giraffe and {{gigantic}} turtles with some dating back 8,000 years. In <b>the</b> 1860s, <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> of two basic species of giraffes, Bramatherium and Sivatherium were found. <b>The</b> <b>fossils</b> of Hipparion {{were also found}} on the island. Several shipwrecks found around the island are dated to the fourteenth century.|$|R
50|$|It is {{the goal}} of the human {{researchers}} to find out if some of <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> have been fabricated and planted there, and whether any interlopers have arrived to interrupt their mission's progress. To help determine whether <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> are fraudulent, samples are sent off for DNA analysis. However, the results are very troubling, as some of <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> are apparently authentic.|$|R
5|$|A {{source of}} {{confusion}} {{is the notion}} that a transitional form between two different taxonomic groups must be a direct ancestor of one or both groups. The difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that {{one of the goals of}} evolutionary taxonomy is to identify taxa that were ancestors of other taxa. However, it is almost impossible to be sure that any form represented in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> record is a direct ancestor of any other. In fact, because evolution is a branching process that produces a complex bush pattern of related species rather than a linear process producing a ladder-like progression, and because of the incompleteness of <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> record, it is unlikely that any particular form represented in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> record is a direct ancestor of any other. Cladistics deemphasizes the concept of one taxonomic group being an ancestor of another, and instead emphasizes the identification of sister taxa that share a more recent common ancestor with one another than they do with other groups. There are a few exceptional cases, such as some marine plankton microfossils, where <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> record is complete enough to suggest with confidence that certain fossils represent a population that was actually ancestral to a later population of a different species. But, in general, transitional fossils are considered to have features that illustrate the transitional anatomical features of actual common ancestors of different taxa, rather than to be actual ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs {{have always}} been an {{extremely}} varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500non-avian dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and {{the total number of}} genera preserved in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> record has been estimated at around1850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered. An earlier study predicted that about 3400dinosaur genera existed, including many {{that would not have been}} preserved in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> record. By September 17, 2008, 1047 different species of dinosaurs had been named.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{examination}} of <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> on March 6, 1999 {{it had already}} become clear to Currie that {{the left and right}} feet mirrored each other perfectly and that <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> had been completed by using both slab and counterslab. He also noticed no connection could be seen between the tail and the body. In July 1999, Currie and the Czerkases brought <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> to the High-Resolution X-ray CT Facility of the University of Texas (Austin) founded and operated by Dr. Timothy Rowe to make CT scans. Rowe, having made the scans on July 29, determined that they indicated that the bottom fragments, showing the tail and the lower legs, were not part of the larger fossil. He informed the Czerkases on August 2 that there was a chance of the whole being a fraud. During a subsequent discussion Rowe and Currie were pressured by the Czerkases to keep their reservations private.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> were {{described}} by F. Knoll of the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales-CSIC in Madrid {{as a new}} taxon, Ignavusaurus rachelis. <b>The</b> <b>fossils</b> {{were brought to the}} National Museum of Natural History in Paris, where they were provisionally catalogued as BM HR 20; the plan was to return <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> to Lesotho upon the opening of the Lesotho National Museum.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> were re-dated {{and found}} to be much earlier than {{previously}} thought. The new study concludes that <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> should be dated to around 250,000 years ago, pushing back the age of <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> by over 100,000 years and thus surpassing Altamura Man as the earliest evidence for Neanderthals in Italy. The new study was a collaborative effort conducted by geologists from the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology working in collaboration with anthropologists and paleontologists from Sapienza University and the University of Wisconsin. This new dating {{is in line with}} the perceived age of the eleven stone artefacts found alongside <b>the</b> Saccopastore <b>fossils,</b> which were thought to have been older than the previously assessed date for <b>the</b> <b>fossils.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cwm Craig-ddu Quarry is a disused quarry in Brecknock, Powys, Wales. It {{has been}} {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest because of <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> found there, particularly <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> of <b>the</b> earliest vascular land plant yet discovered.|$|R

5|$|Even though <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> {{record of}} bats extends over 50 million years, their fossils are {{extremely}} rare. <b>The</b> <b>fossil</b> {{record of the}} greater noctule in the Iberian Peninsula suggests that they lived at different geographical locations from that of today. The fossils of greater noctule are almost non-existent prior to the Miocene epoch. The deterioration of the climate {{at the end of}} Neogene led to the disappearance of tropical species and vespertilionids profited by accessing a wider range of habitats.|$|E
5|$|However, the Protophysarum balticum from Baltic amber, first {{described}} by Dörfelt and Schmidt in 2006, is considered questionable. <b>The</b> <b>fossil</b> was {{inconsistent with the}} typical characteristics of the genus {{and it was not}} a valid publication because no Latin name was identified with it. Also, important details of its fruit bodies were not visible or contradicted the identification. Today it is assumed that <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> belongs to a lichen similar to the genus Chaenotheca. The only known discovery of a preserved plasmodium was found in amber in the Dominican Republic, and was then grouped into the Physarida. However, this claim is also considered doubtful as the publication was later classified as insufficient due to lack of evidence. The only known mineralised fossils are the two spore findings from 1971, one of which, Trichia favoginea, is assumed to be from the postglacial period. In palynologian researches, by absorbing Myxogastria spores, <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> was not recognised.|$|E

5000|$|Aachenosaurus is {{a dubious}} genus of prehistoric plant.

50|$|Parts of <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> are <b>the</b> {{earliest}} to {{have been}} classified by Leakey as Homo sapiens.

5000|$|Two partials skulls of Spinops {{were found}} in 1916, in a large bone bed near the Red Deer River of {{southern}} Alberta, by American commercial fossil collector Charles Hazelius Sternberg and his son Levi Sternberg. <b>The</b> <b>fossils</b> {{were sent to the}} Natural History Museum in London (then called the British Museum (Natural History)), which had financed the expedition. The museum considered <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> too fragmentary to display, leaving them unprepared in the collections. In a letter to Charles H. Sternberg, English paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward of the British Museum called the Spinops material [...] "nothing but rubbish". The precise whereabouts of the bonebed that yielded <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> is unknown due to poor field record keeping, but Darren Tanke of the Royal Tyrrell Museum is spearheading attempts at its relocation. <b>The</b> <b>fossils</b> were re-examined in 2011 by a team led by Dr Andrew A.
