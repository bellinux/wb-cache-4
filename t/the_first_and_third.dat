5|$|A villanelle (also {{known as}} villanesque) is a nineteen-line poetic form {{consisting}} of five tercets {{followed by a}} quatrain.

5|$|Football {{games last}} {{for a total of}} 60 minutes in {{professional}} and college play and are divided into two-halves of 30 minutes and four-quarters of 15 minutes. High school football games are 48 minutes in length with two-halves of 24 minutes and four-quarters of 12 minutes. The two-halves are separated by a halftime period, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>third</b> quarters are also followed by a short break. Prior {{to the start of the}} game, the referee and team captains for each team meet at midfield for a coin toss. The visiting team is allowed to call 'heads' or 'tails'; the winner of the toss is allowed to decide between choosing whether to receive or kick off the ball or choosing which goal they want to defend, but they can also defer their choice until the second half. The losing team, unless the winning team decides to defer, is allowed to choose the option the winning team did not select, and receives the option to receive, kick, or select a goal to defend to begin the second half. Most teams choose to receive or defer, because choosing to kick the ball to start the game would allow the other team to choose which goal to defend. Teams switch goals following <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>third</b> quarters. If a down is in progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed.|$|E

5|$|The Anthony Roll was {{originally}} {{a set of}} three separate vellum rolls. It exists today {{in the form of}} a bound volume containing <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>third</b> rolls while the second roll is preserved in its original form. The three original rolls were made up out of a total of 17 individual membranes glued to the back of the next membrane. The membranes were of a width of 70cm (27 ½ inches) and a height varying from 79 to 96cm (31 to 37 ¾ inches). After receiving <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>third</b> rolls Pepys had his clerks cut the rolls up and bound in a single volume as a book, now known as Pepys 2991. The transformation of the two rolls created a horizontal page structure, and some of the ornamentation that was cut in process was copied into the volume by hand. Pepys also inserted abstracts between the two rolls and a summarizing table that was not Anthony's, but pre-dated Pepys' binding of the rolls. This radical treatment of the original document has damaged some of the illustrations and is today deprecated. The first three illustrations of the Henry Grace à Dieu, Mary Rose and Peter Pomegranate were all too large to fit on one page and were therefore converted to two-page spreads. The resulting bend down the centre of the illustrations led to noticeable loss of detail. Despite this, there are no plans to attempt a recreation of the original structure of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>third</b> rolls. The second roll, British Library Additional MS 22047, is still in its original condition with the exception of a written endorsement by Mary Fox from 1857 and some damage caused by an application of chemicals to reveal faded writing.|$|E
