5|$|Thelma is a 1910 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The story was based on Marie Corelli's 1887 novel of the same name, it focuses on a Norwegian maiden who meets Sir Phillip and the two are wed. Lady Clara conspires to ruin the marriage and tricks Thelma with a letter purported to be from her husband. Thelma returns to Norway and {{to the death of}} her father. Thelma, alone in the world, prays at her mother's grave for strength. Sir Phillip searches for Thelma, ultimately finding her, uncovers <b>the</b> <b>tricks</b> which have been played on them and they fall back in love. Released on June 21, 1910, the film was met with praise in The Moving Picture World. An incomplete print of the film survives in the Library of Congress archives.|$|E
5|$|Between 1870 and 1873, chemist and {{physicist}} William Crookes conducted {{experiments to}} determine {{the validity of the}} phenomena produced by three mediums: Florence Cook, Kate Fox, and Home. Crookes' final report in 1874 concluded that the phenomena produced by all three mediums were genuine, a result which was roundly derided by the scientific establishment. Crookes recorded that he controlled and secured Home by placing his feet on the top of Home's feet. Crooke's method of foot control later proved inadequate when used with Eusapia Palladino, as she merely slipped her foot out and into her sturdy shoe. In addition, Crookes' motives, methods, and conclusions with regard to Florence Cook were called into question, both at the time and subsequently, casting doubt on his conclusions about Home. In a series of experiments in London at the house of Crookes in February 1875, the medium Anna Eva Fay managed to fool Crookes into believing she had genuine psychic powers. Fay later confessed to her fraud and revealed <b>the</b> <b>tricks</b> she had used.|$|E
5|$|Goat Simulator is an {{open-ended}} third-person perspective {{game in which}} the player controls a goat. The player is free to explore the game's world, a suburban setting, as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects. Licking objects attaches the goat's tongue to the object and lets the player drag the object around until they let go. At any time, the player can let the goat drop into a ragdoll model, allowing the game's physics to take over, and another control makes the game run in slow-motion. A number of environmental features allow the player to manipulate the goat into stunts such as bouncing off trampolines or launching the goat into the air through large fans. The game features a scoring system similar to skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, whereby doing tricks or other actions earns points, while chaining such tricks together in sequence helps build a multiplier that applies to the total score of <b>the</b> <b>tricks</b> done in the sequence. Various in-game goals, such as achieving a certain height, completing flips, or destroying certain objects, are given to the player, but the player {{is not required to}} follow these instructions.|$|E
50|$|The {{player who}} played the highest card of the suit led wins <b>the</b> <b>trick,</b> unless trump is played, then the highest trump card wins <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> Players who play neither the suit led nor trump cannot win <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> <b>The</b> player that won <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> {{collects}} <b>the</b> played cards {{from the table and}} then leads <b>the</b> next <b>trick.</b>|$|R
50|$|Eldest hand leads any card to <b>the</b> first <b>trick.</b> <b>The</b> {{remaining}} {{players are}} completely free in which card {{to play to}} <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> <b>The</b> last player to play a card of the same rank as the card led wins <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> and leads to <b>the</b> next <b>trick.</b> While <b>the</b> stock lasts, after each <b>trick</b> <b>the</b> players fill up their hands, starting with the winner of <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b>|$|R
25|$|If {{there are}} trump cards in <b>the</b> <b>trick,</b> <b>the</b> highest trump in it wins <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> If {{there are no}} trumps in it, the highest card of the suit led wins <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Dragon {{may only}} be played in a single card <b>trick.</b> <b>The</b> player wins <b>the</b> <b>trick,</b> unless <b>the</b> Dragon is bombed. If <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> is won with <b>the</b> Dragon, <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> is given to your {{opponent}} (you choose which one). Furthermore, if the dragon is bombed, the player who played the largest bomb on <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> takes <b>the</b> entire <b>trick</b> for themselves (which includes the dragon).|$|R
5000|$|The highest card of <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> {{is called}} <b>the</b> Boss card. (e.g. if <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> is K, 4, 7, Q, 3 - players state that <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> is [...] "K-boss") ...|$|R
50|$|Eldest hand leads any card to <b>the</b> first <b>trick,</b> and <b>the</b> {{other player}} plays any card to <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> is {{won by the}} highest trump, or by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> draws a card, {{followed}} by the other player, then leads any card to <b>the</b> next <b>trick.</b>|$|R

25|$|The highest-ranking {{cards for}} taking <b>the</b> <b>tricks</b> (the Jacks) {{are not the}} highest scoring cards. The Aces and Tens {{combined}} make up almost {{three quarters of the}} total points; taking as many as possible of them is thus imperative for winning. On the other hand, taking 7s, 8s and 9s doesn't help (or hurt) at all, unless Schwarz was declared.|$|E
25|$|To win a Null game, declarer {{must not}} take a single trick. Null games are often not played through to the end, either because declarer is forced to take a trick, ending the game prematurely, or because it becomes {{apparent}} to the defenders {{that they will be}} forced to take the rest of <b>the</b> <b>tricks.</b> There are no card points in a Null game.|$|E
50|$|The non-dealer {{leads to}} <b>the</b> first <b>trick.</b> A trick is {{taken by the}} highest card of the suit led that is in <b>the</b> <b>trick,</b> unless <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> {{contains}} a card from the trump suit, in which case it is taken by the highest trump card in <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> Until <b>the</b> stock is gone, there is no obligation to follow suit or to trump. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> is taken by the winner, turned face down, {{and should not be}} looked at again. The winner scores the value of the two cards in <b>the</b> <b>trick,</b> as shown on the table above. Players must remember how many points they have taken since their scores may not be recorded, and they are not allowed to look back at previous <b>tricks.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> is played, <b>the</b> winner takes the top card of the stock to replenish his hand, then the loser does the same. The winner of <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> leads to <b>the</b> next <b>trick.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{player who}} played the highest valued card wins <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> If one or more trump card was played, the highest value trump card wins the trick; {{otherwise}} the highest value card of the leading suit wins <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> <b>The</b> player who won <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> takes <b>the</b> cards in <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> into his [...] "winnings pile," [...] which will be used later to determine the player's score for that round.|$|R
50|$|In trick-play players {{must follow}} suit. A player who cannot follow a plain suit led, and whose partner does not {{currently}} head <b>the</b> <b>trick,</b> must head <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> by playing a higher trump than any trumps already in <b>the</b> <b>trick,</b> if {{able to do}} so.To a trump lead, players must always head <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> if they can. The partnership taking <b>the</b> last <b>trick</b> scores 10 points. A partnership taking all tricks scores another 90 points.|$|R
25|$|Boston: Also {{known as}} Shooting The Moon or Slamming. Related to but {{opposite}} of a Double Nil bid.

In 1925 Houdini hired her for his undercover investigator team. The team included several other women besides Mackenberg, including Houdini's niece Julia Sawyer and a showgirl named Alberta Chapman. Houdini also sometimes employed men including Clifford M. Eddy, Jr., Robert H. Gysel, and Amadeo Vacca.|$|E

50|$|The {{player to}} the dealer's left leads <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> Any card {{can be played}} but only the highest will win. If there is a tie, then <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> is spoiled and no one wins that <b>trick.</b> <b>The</b> player that wins or spoils <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> will start <b>the</b> next <b>trick.</b> Players can only {{communicate}} to their partner using subtle signals and gestures as described above.|$|R

Bernard is sympathetic to Hacker's plight and tries to enlighten his Minister as to <b>the</b> <b>tricks</b> and techniques employed by government staff, but his ability to help is limited by his own loyalties in the Civil Service. Hacker soon learns and becomes more sly and cynical, using some of these ploys himself. While Sir Humphrey nearly always gets the upper hand, Hacker now and again plays a trump card, and on even fewer occasions, {{the two of them}} work towards a common goal.|$|E
25|$|In 1854, Anderson held a {{farewell}} performance in Aberdeen. The {{success of this}} show was enough to inspire Anderson not to retire. Rather, he began to concentrate his efforts on exposing <b>the</b> <b>tricks</b> of mediums and spiritualist fraud. In his shows, he used his daughters to duplicate spiritualist effects. Anderson {{was one of the}} magicians of his day who exposed the frauds of the Davenport brothers. The show played at the Lyceum in London and then moved to Covent Garden in 1855. The following year, after a gala performance, the theatre caught fire, destroying all of Anderson's properties and bankrupting him {{for the second time in}} his professional career.|$|E
25|$|Points are scored {{based on}} <b>the</b> <b>tricks</b> {{won in the}} hand. There {{are several ways to}} count up the points for play, but they always add up to 250 points. The last trick is always worth an {{additional}} 10 points added to any existing points in the actual trick cards. The classic counting system of pinochle is where aces are worth 11, tens are worth 10, kings are worth four, queens are worth three, jacks are worth two, and nines are worth zero. This method takes longer to count the score {{at the end of each}} hand. A simpler method is to count aces and tens for 10 points, kings and queens for five points, and jacks and nines are worth zero.|$|E
50|$|The play {{begins with}} the elder hand leading <b>the</b> initial <b>trick,</b> after which <b>the</b> winner of <b>the</b> {{previous}} <b>trick</b> leads <b>the</b> next. If {{it is possible to}} follow suit, then the other player must always do so. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> is won by the highest card in the suit led. If a trump card is played then the highest trump wins <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> If a player can win <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> then they must do so.|$|R

25|$|A {{partnership}} reneges {{on their}} contract if they violate {{the rules of}} play; most often this happens when a player plays off-suit when they could have, and therefore should have, followed suit. The penalty for reneging varies; in most cases it nullifies that team's contract (the team cannot make their contract and their score is reduced by 10 points for each bid trick), while sometimes reneging results in a three-trick penalty, meaning the team may still make contract but must take three additional tricks to do so. It does not matter if the player reneges on purpose. The bags still count against the opposing team, and will go against their points. On the other-hand if a team calls reneg and that team cannot prove or call out the first hand that was a potential reneg, then the team that called out the false accusation is penalized the three-trick penalty. <b>The</b> <b>tricks</b> do not count towards opponents bid.|$|E
25|$|Highlander Scoring: The points awarded {{function}} slightly {{differently than}} in conventional Spades. Highlander Scoring merges partnership playing with individual team effort. Sandbagging {{does not apply}} {{with this type of}} game play, although sandbagging could be included. Each partner makes a bid of <b>the</b> <b>tricks</b> they think they can win. Each partner must win the total they individually bid; if not, that player's bid value is deducted from the team's score even if their partner took enough trick to make up the difference. :For example, if Tom bids 5 tricks and wins 4 tricks, and Harry (his partner) bids 3 tricks and wins 4 tricks, 80 points is deducted from the partnership's total score even though the team won their promised 8 tricks, because Tom did not make his bid. However, Harry is awarded five points per overtrick, so they are −75 points instead of −80 points. If the contract is broken and no overtricks were taken, the team is down the full amount of the bid. If both made their contract and have won overtricks, they are awarded five extra points per overtrick. Team that wins seven or more tricks per round is given 10 points the first time, 20 points the second, and each time thereafter the points increase by 10. This encourages race-style play where players set out to take as many tricks as they can {{as long as they do}} not steal tricks their partner needs.|$|E

In the 21st century, professional skateboarder Dylan Rieder accomplishes <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> over a New York (U.S.) park bench in a video segment for the Gravis footwear company. Professional skateboarder David Gonzales performed <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> for <b>the</b> [...] "Trickipedia" [...] section of The Berrics website.|$|R
50|$|The {{player to}} the left of the dealer leads first; the other players follow in a {{clockwise}} direction. Each player must follow suit, that is, play a card in the same suit as the first-played card in <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> If he cannot follow suit, he can play a trump or any other card. The player playing the highest trump or the highest card in the current suit wins <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> and plays <b>the</b> first card of <b>the</b> next <b>trick.</b> Since each card exists twice, there is the possibility of a tie; in that case, the first-played card wins <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> For example, when <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> consists of ♠10 ♠A ♠9 ♠A, the player who played the first Ace of Spades wins <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b>|$|R
