5|$|The {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> {{international aid}} was moderate. American church groups, Cuba, and Mexico collectively contributed around 2,500tons {{of food and}} medicine. The Canadian, Swedish, West German, Spanish, and Dutch Governments contributed aid amounting to 2million dollars (1988) each. No aid was sent by the United States government. The Soviet Union contributed an unknown sum. The slow response <b>to</b> <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> aid was contributed to by the Sandinista Government's actions, which was viewed by a few anonymous diplomats from other countries who commented to the press, as undermining the peace process championed by Óscar Arias. Those actions were the July 10 arrests of opposition activists and the closing down of independent radio stations. In addition, the government also barred foreign humanitarian groups from receiving American aid, as well as turning back a relief shipment days before the storm.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's volunteers responded <b>to</b> <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> {{military}} {{service in the}} early months of the war; however, as the war progressed and the number of casualties increased, the state government had to resort to conscription (the draft) to fill its quotas. Military conscription, which began in October 1862, was a divisive issue within the state. It was especially unpopular among Democrats, who viewed it as a threat to individual freedom and opposed legislation that allowed a man to purchase an exemption for $300 or pay another person to serve as his substitute. A total of 3,003 Hoosier men were drafted in October 1862; subsequent drafts in Indiana brought the total to 17,903.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} was also slow in responding <b>to</b> <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> compensation. While {{waiting for a}} response, {{the question of how}} to use any compensation was debated in provincial newspapers and pamphlets. Some, such as Samuel Adams (father of the famous American Revolution leader), advocated placing the money in London banks to serve as backing for the paper currency issued by the colonies. Others, including William Douglass and Thomas Hutchinson, speaker of the General Court, favoured using the compensation to redeem the paper currency and give Massachusetts a hard currency. In 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle returned Louibourg to France, with Massachusetts still awaiting compensation for its seizure.|$|E

25|$|Although Fahey's Maria Duce {{organisation}} {{was initially}} left {{to its own}} devices, Archbishop McQuaid grew less sympathetic {{to it in the}} latter half of the 1950s. He condemned the group for their heavy-handed reaction <b>to</b> <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> an interview from the anti-Catholic American writer Paul Blanshard (whom Bishop McQuaid felt should have been treated courteously despite disagreeing strongly with him). McQuaid went as far as to write to Fahey in 1954 stating that he opposed the latter's association of the name of the Blessed Virgin Mary with his organisation. Fahey died before any response could be made, and the group was disbanded the following year; McQuaid took on the group afterward.|$|E
25|$|Central Plains Water Trust {{has been}} in some lengthy {{litigation}} with Ngāi Tahu Properties Limited and Synlait. The three entities have resource consents or applications for resource consents to take the same water - the remaining water from the Rakaia and Waimakariri Rivers, allocated for abstraction by the Rakaia Water Conservation Order or the Waimakariri Rivers Regional Plan. The issue before the courts is 'who has first access to limited water? The first to have consent granted? The first to file an application to take water? The first to file all necessary applications? The first to have replied <b>to</b> <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> information so that the application is complete and therefore 'notifiable'? The cases have been appealed up to the Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|Attachment {{influences}} {{both the}} perception of support from others and the tendency to seek support from others. People who have attachments who respond consistently and positively <b>to</b> <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> closeness allow individuals to have secure attachments, and in return they seek more support, in a generally relaxed way, while people whose attachments are inconsistent in reacting positively or regularly reject requests for support find they need to use other attachment styles. People with secure attachment styles may trust their attachments to provide support because their attachments have reliably offered support in the past. They {{may be more likely}} to ask for support when it's needed. People with insecure attachment styles often do not have a history of supportive responses from their attachments. They may rely less on their attachments and be less likely to ask for support when it's needed, though there may be other factors involved, as well.|$|E

25|$|In 1954, a columbarium was {{controversially}} {{built at}} the rear of the church. Columbariums, walls with niches for the ashes of the dead, became more common at churches and cemeteries, in response to the increased acceptance of cremation. Australia's first columbarium was built in Box Hill in Victoria in 1929. Cremation services first became available in Queensland in September 1934, when the Mount Thompson crematorium opened. The following year a columbarium was provided at Mount Thompson. By 1936, 13% of people interred in Brisbane were being cremated. The increased popularity of cremation led <b>to</b> <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> ashes to be deposited at Anglican churches. The Archbishop of the time, Dr William Wand, publicly opposed placing ashes in the main body of the church, preferring a designated annex such as a remodelled crypt or eastward extension. Queensland's first columbaria within churches were built at Holy Trinity Anglican Church, Woolloongabba and St Mark's Anglican Church, Warwick in 1938. The first external columbarium was incorporated into an outer wall of St Mary's Church at Kangaroo Point in 1949.|$|E
