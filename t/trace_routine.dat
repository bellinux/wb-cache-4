Circuit output is predicted by combining the individual cell outputs using the single diode model of a solar cell.

Cosmic ray energies are typically in the GeV range or even above but in our case also solar energetic particles in the MeV range had to be considered (the simulation code was designed to cover energies down to 1 MeV). At lower energies, the efficiency of the outward orbit tracing approach suffers from the increasing proportion of re-entrant particles (trajectories with both start points and end points near Earth) that do not contribute to the energetic particle flux of solar or cosmic origin but simply produce computational overhead. The main problem associated with inward orbit tracing is the class of trajectories that miss the planet but this particle population is easier to control, and in our case it produced less computational problems than the returning particle population near the planet.|$|R

40|$|In Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) {{applications}} guided {{waves are}} attractive to perform rapid inspections of long lengths and large areas. However, they are complicated, {{therefore it is}} important to have as much information and understanding about their physical properties as possible in order to design the most efficient and robust inspection process as well as to draw the correct conclusions from the measurement results. The main piece of information to gain insight into the guided wave's properties is dispersion curves which, for isotropic structures such as plates and cylinders, have been available for many years. There are many robust algorithms which are currently used to compute them: finite element simulations, partial wave based root finding routines (PWRF) and semi-analytical finite element simulations (SAFE). These methodologies have been generalized and also used to study and compute dispersion curves of more complicated anisotropic materials though the range of tractable cases was limited. Although robust, all these approaches present several challenges, mostly computational, such as missing modes (PWRF), the so called "large-fd" problem (PWRF), artificially increased stiffness (FE, SAFE) or improvement of dispersion curve <b>tracing</b> <b>routines</b> (FE, PWRF, SAFE). In addition, when studying complicated anisotropic materials with a low degree of symmetry or unusual axes configurations where propagation does not take place along any of the principal axes, PWRF routines are frequently unreliable and one must resort to specific SAFE simulations which also present their own challenges and, depending on the SAFE scheme used, can yield spurious modes which need to be carefully filtered. Recently, Pseudospectral Methods (Galerkin and Collocation schemes), were introduced in the field of elastic guided waves, providing a powerful, yet strikingly and conceptually simple alternative to the above algorithms by successfully finding the dispersion curves in isotropic structures and in some simple anisotropic problems. However, a systematic and general approach for accurately and robustly computing dispersion curves of guided waves in anisotropic media, up to the most general case of triclinic symmetry, has not yet been developed. The goal of the work presented in this thesis is to develop such a tool by means of the Pseudospectral Collocation Method (SCM) and to take advantage of its particular features to make it as robust as possible. Firstly, a PSCM scheme is developed for computing dispersion curves of guided waves in anisotropic elastic media by finding all the frequencies for a given value of the real wavenumber. The results are validated with the existing literature as well as with the results provided by the software DISPERSE developed in the NDT group at Imperial College London. Many of the most remarkable features of the PSCM (spectral accuracy, speed, and its failure to miss modes for instance) are already observed in this simple, yet important, class of problems in elastic media. Secondly, guided waves in viscoelastic anisotropic media are studied. In this case, modes present attenuation due to material damping which is reflected in the wavenumber being complex. In order to handle complex wavenumbers the PSCM schemes developed for elastic materials are appropriately extended by means of the Companion Matrix Method. It will be seen that, apart from lowly attenuated propagating modes, all the other highly attenuated modes are found, yielding the full three-dimensional spectrum of the problem under consideration. Moreover, when the PSCM schemes for viscoelastic media are used to compute the dispersion curves of guided waves in an elastic medium, all the remaining, imaginary as well as complex, roots of the elastic problem which were not computed by the simpler PSCM elastic schemes are found, providing the full three-dimensional picture of the dispersion curves. These PSCM schemes, as any other of the aforementioned approaches, only find pairs (ω,k). If dispersion curves are to be plotted, those pairs must be linked correctly in order to plot the desired dispersion curves, which is non-trivial when crossings amongst modes occur. Motivated by this, an investigation of the parity and coupling properties of guided wave solutions is carried out in detail for all crystal classes. This investigation provides a robust alternative to conventional <b>tracing</b> <b>routines</b> and avoids the problem of mode crossings by exploiting the parity and coupling properties of the solutions. Finally, the most complicated problems involving embedded structures are investigated by including a Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) in the previously developed PSCM schemes for viscoelastic media. The dispersion curves for leaky and trapped modes in an isotropic elastic plate and in a similar cylinder immersed in an infinite ideal fluid are found, showing very good agreement with the results given by PWRF routines in a large range of frequencies. Last, but not least, an illustration of a two-dimensional PSCM scheme is presented to study a vibrating membrane. The results are compared with the available analytical solution showing again excellent agreement. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) {{constitutes}} one suitable {{solution for}} exploiting solar resources for power generation. In this context, parabolic dish systems concentrate the solar radiation onto a point focusing receiver for small-scale power production. Given the modularity feature of such system, the scale-up is a feasible option; however, {{they offer a}} suitable solution for small scale off-grid electrification of rural areas. These systems are usually used with Stirling engines, nevertheless the coupling with micro-gas turbines presents a number of advantages, related to {{the reliability of the}} system and the lower level of maintenance required. The OMSoP project, funded by the European Union, aims at the demonstration of a parabolic dish coupled with an air-driven Brayton cycle. By looking at the integrated system, a key-role is played by the solar receiver, whose function is the absorption of the concentrated solar radiation and its transfer to the heat transfer fluid. Volumetric solar receivers constitute a novel and promising solution for such applications; the use of a porous matrix for the solar radiation absorption allows reaching higher temperature within a compact volume, while reducing the heat transfer losses between the fluid and the absorption medium. The aim of the present work is to deliver a set of optimal design specifications for a volumetric solar receiver for the OMSoP project. The work is based on a Multi-Objective Optimization algorithm, with the objective of the enhancement of the receiver thermal efficiency and of the reduction of the pressure drop. The optimization routine is coupled with a detailed analysis of the component, based on a Computational Fluid Dynamics model and a Mechanical Stress Analysis. The boundary conditions are given by the OMSoP project, in terms of dish specifications and power cycle, whilst the solar radiation boundary is modelled by means of a Ray <b>Tracing</b> <b>routine.</b> The outcome of the analysis is the assessment of the impact on the receiver performance of some key design parameters, namely the porous material properties and the receiver geometrical dimensions. From the results, it is observed a general low pressure drop related to the nominal air mass flow, with several points respecting the materials limitations. One design point is chosen among the optimal points, which respects the OMSoP project requirements for the design objectives, i. e. a minimum value of efficiency of 70 %, and pressure losses below 1 %. The final receiver configuration performs with an efficiency value of 86 %, with relative pressure drop of 0. 5 %, and it is based on a ceramic foam absorber made of silicon carbide, with porosity value of 0. 94.  Moreover, the detailed analysis of one volumetric receiver configuration to be integrated in the OMSoP project shows promising results for experimental testing and for its actual integration in the system. ...|$|R

40|$|Badiey, MohsenAcoustical {{oceanography}} {{is one way}} {{to study}} the ocean, its internal layers, boundaries and all processes occurring within using underwater acoustics. Acoustical sensing techniques allows for the measurement of ocean processes from within that logistically or financially preclude traditional in-situ measurements. Acoustic signals propagate as pressure wavefronts from a source to a receiver through an ocean medium with variable physical parameters. The water column physical parameters that change acoustic wave propagation in the ocean include temperature, salinity, current, surface roughness, seafloor bathymetry, and vertical stratification over variable time scales. The impacts of short-time scale water column variability on acoustic wave propagation include coherent and incoherent surface reflections, wavefront arrival time delay, focusing or defocusing of the intensity of acoustic beams and refraction of acoustic rays. This study focuses on high-frequency broadband acoustic waves, and examines the influence of short-time scale water column variability on broadband high-frequency acoustics, wavefronts, from 7 to 28 kHz, in shallow water. Short-time scale variability is on the order of seconds to hours and the short-spatial scale variability is on the order of few centimeters. Experimental results were collected during an acoustic experiment along 100 m isobaths and data analysis was conducted using available acoustic wave propagation models. Three main topics are studied to show that acoustic waves are viable as a remote sensing tool to measure oceanographic parameters in shallow water. First, coherent surface reflections forming striation patterns, from multipath receptions, through rough surface interaction of broadband acoustic signals with the dynamic sea surface are analyzed. Matched filtered results of received acoustic waves are compared with a ray tracing numerical model using a sea surface boundary generated from measured water wave spectra at the time of signal propagation. It is determined that on a time scale of seconds, corresponding to typical periods of surface water waves, the arrival time of reflected acoustic signals from surface waves appear as striation patterns in measured data and can be accurately modelled by ray tracing. Second, changes in acoustic beam arrival angle and acoustic ray path influenced by isotherm depth oscillations are analyzed using an 8 -element delay-sum beamformer. The results are compared with outputs from a two-dimensional (2 -D) parabolic equation (PE) model using measured sound speed profiles (SSPs) in the water column. Using the method of beamforming on the received signal, the arrival time and angle of an acoustic beam was obtained for measured acoustic signals. It is determined that the acoustic ray path, acoustic beam intensity and angular spread are a function of vertical isotherm oscillations on a time scale of minutes and can be modeled accurately by a 2 -D PE model. Third, a forward problem is introduced which uses acoustic wavefronts received on a vertical line array, 1. 48 km from the source, in {{the lower part of the}} water column to infer range dependence or independence in the SSP. The matched filtering results of received acoustic wavefronts at all hydrophone depths are compared with a ray <b>tracing</b> <b>routine</b> augmented to calculate only direct path and bottom reflected signals. It is determined that the SSP range dependence can be inferred on a time scale of hours using an array of hydrophones spanning the water column. Sound speed profiles in the acoustic field were found to be range independent for 11 of the 23 hours in the measurements. A SSP cumulative reconstruction process, conducted from the seafloor to the sea surface, layer-by-layer, identifies critical segments in the SSP that define the ray path, arrival time and boundary interactions. Data-model comparison between matched filtered arrival time spread and arrival time output from the ray tracing was robust when the SSP measured at the receiver was input to the model. When the SSP measured nearest the source (at the same instant in time) was input to the ray tracing model, the data-model comparison was poor. It was determined that the cumulative sound speed change in the SSP near the source was 1. 041 m/s greater than that of the SSP at the receiver and resulted in the poor data-model comparison. In this study, the influences on broadband acoustic wave propagation in the frequency range of 7 to 28 kHz of spatial and temporal changes in the oceanography of shallow water regions are addressed. Acoustic waves can be used as remote sensing tools to measure oceanographic parameters in shallow water and data-model comparison results show a direct relationship between the oceanographic variations and acoustic wave propagations.

Of the hairs screened, 35 % of telogen roots contained nuclei and in total 6 % of all roots screened had more than 100 nuclei.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} a simple method for pressure-volume (PV) curve tracing without special equipment and to compare {{this with a}} classic method in terms of reliability and reproducibility. Design: PV curves were traced initially in a lung model at 16 different settings of lung mechanics to validate the accuracy of a new method using a series of non cumulative inflations (NCI technique). The NCI technique was then compared with the classic multiple occlusion (MO) technique in 12 mechanically ventilated patients. Finally the NCI technique was used in 13 cardiosurgical patients to evaluate changes of thoracopulmonary inspiratory compliance (Ctpi) induced by sternotomy. Setting: General ICU - Evangelismos Hospital, Critical Care Department of Athens University. Measurements and Results: The results of the bench study revealed that volume measurements with the NCI technique were more accurate pneumotachograph measurements. The pneumotachograph’s error increased as resistances increased and compliance decreased. Concordance analysis between the two techniques in ICU patients showed a satisfactory agreement, a similar reproducibility and no adverse effects in any case (bias 0. 8, 95 % limits of agreement - 5. 6 to 7, 2 ml/cmH 2 O). When used in cardiosurgical patients, the NCI technique revealed {{a significant increase in}} Ctpi (p 0. 037) with an upward and leftward sifts of the PV curve after sternotomy. Conclusions: The NCI technique and the MO technique can be used interchangeably in clinical practice. The simplicity and the feasibility of the NCI technique could allow PV curve <b>tracing</b> in clinical <b>routine</b> in every ICU without any special equipment. ...|$|R
40|$|L- 2 -Hydroxyglutaric acidaemia {{represents}} a newly defined inborn error of metabolism, with {{increased levels of}} L- 2 -hydroxyglutaric acid in urine, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. The concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is higher than in plasma. The other consistent biochemical finding is an increase of lysine in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, but lysine loading does not increase L- 2 -hydroxyglutaric acid concentration in plasma. This autosomal recessively inherited disease is expressed as progressive ataxia, mental deficiency with subcortical leukoencephalopathy and cerebellar atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging. Since these features were described in 8 patients by Barth and co-workers in 1992, 4 more patients with similar findings have been diagnosed and added to the present series. L- 2 -Hydroxyglutaric acid is found in only <b>trace</b> amounts on <b>routine</b> gas chromatographic screening in normal persons, and its origin, its fate and even its relevance to normal metabolism are unknown. Therefore its catabolism was studied in normal liver. Incubation of rat liver with L- 2 -hydroxyglutaric acid did not produce H 2 O 2, which excluded (peroxisomal) L- 2 -hydroxyacid oxidase as the main route of catabolism. However, L- 2 -hydroxyglutaric acid is rapidly dehydrogenated if NAD+ is added as a co-factor to the standard reaction medium. This could also be demonstrated in human liver. The preliminary evidence for this enzyme activity in rats and humans, L- 2 -hydroxyglutaric acid dehydrogenase, is given. Further investigations are required to clarify the possible relevance to the metabolic defect in L- 2 -hydroxyglutaric acidaemi...|$|R
40|$|The {{strengths}} and weaknesses of using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS) measurements of samples in solution for marine environmental analyses using real world examples is discussed. ICPMS can detect nanogram per litre concentrations of trace elements but suffers from polyatomic interferences generated from the sample matrix. Most of the <b>routine</b> <b>trace</b> elements measured in marine biological tissue and sediment digests, with the notable exceptions of iron, chromium, vanadium, and selenium, are not subject to severe interferences. Low recoveries of trace elements from sediments are due to the inability of extraction acids to remove trace elements such as chromium and nickel from sediment matrices. The use of ICPMS offers the advantage that elements such as phosphorus, which previously required elaborate digestion procedures and a colorimetric determination, can be rapidly determined using nitric acid digestion alone. The use of flow injection coupled with ICPMS allows on-line preconcentration of trace metals and metalloids using chelation by ion-exchange resins or hydride generation and trapping as well as separation from matrix elements. Thus, the <b>routine</b> determination of <b>trace</b> elements and inorganic and methylated arsenic, antimony, mercury, and germanium species in open-ocean waters is possible. The coupling of HPLC and GC to ICPMS allows the measurement of metal and metalloid species in biological and sediment extracts. However, extraction of unaltered species from matrices presents a challenge. Many of the species found in the environmental samples are not known and analytical standards are not available. The concurrent use of HPLC-MS is needed to confirm these species...|$|R
40|$|A new {{analytical}} method for the rapid extraction and unequivocal confirmation of herbicides chlormequat (CQ) and mepiquat (MQ) in wheat flours and various flours utilized in infant foods was developed. The extraction procedure {{is based on}} pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), using ethanol as extractant at high pressure and temperatures; the extraction rapidity is combined with the elevated selectivity and sensibility of the LC-MS-MS. Analytes were separated by ion exchange chromatography and d 9 -chlormequat was used as internal standard. Mass-spectrometric detection was conducted with a triple quadrupole equipped with a TurboIonSpray source operating in positive ionization mode. Two Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) were chosen for each analyte and the developed {{analytical method}} was validated by evaluating recovery, precision, linear dynamic range, sensitivity, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ). Special {{emphasis was placed on}} the versatility and robustness of automated PLE for <b>routine</b> <b>trace</b> determination of the selected analytes; moreover, the use of ethanol allowed one to inject the sample directly, avoiding the evaporation step. In particular, the study addresses the impact of the food matrix on ion suppression by comparing solvent calibration curves with those obtained by blank extracts, spiked with analytes. Calibration curves in matrix displayed a slope lower of about 20 % than that noticed in the solvent. Recoveries ranged from 83 to 99 % at a fortification level of 10 ppb, corresponding to the maximum residue limit established by the European Union, while intra-day precision was less than 10 % for all samples. The developed method was applied to detect the incidental presence of MQ and CQ in different cereal flours. In particular, traces of the selected herbicides were detected in about 50 % of baby foods...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of methods capable of determining individual metal species at trace levels {{is a widely}} researched topic. The majority of the techniques developed for this purpose involve the use of “coupled” instrumental techniques to separate and detect metal species at low concentrations, also additional derivatisation steps are often required prior to detection. This approach requires lengthy analysis times and high manual input to construct and maintain the interface between the two instruments. Complicated sample preparation procedures are also necessary for tissue samples. These factors discourage the implementation of routine environmental monitoring of trace metal species. In {{the course of this}} study, alternative techniques for trace metal speciation are examined. The criteria for these techniques is that each should be straightforward in design and operation requiring a minimal level of manual input while remaining cost effective. The use of a solid phase extraction technique known as Matrix Solid Phase Dispersion (MSPD) is evaluated for extracting arsenic species from fish tissues. MSPD involves physically grinding up tissue samples with a quantity of chromatographic packing material and packing the resulting mixture into a column followed by selective elution of the analytes with mobile phase. The technique is developed and validated for five arsenic species. The effectiveness of this technique is then assessed by comparison with an existing liquid-liquid extraction protocol. The feasibility of capillary electrophoretic methods (CE) for <b>routine</b> <b>trace</b> metal speciation is examined for arsenic and methylated tin species respectively. This technique involves the separation of charged species in narrow bore capillary tubing under the influence of an electric field. CE offers the benefits of highly efficient separations, short analysis times, minimal sample preparation requirements and small reagent consumption. Problems with low sensitivity can be overcome with electrostacking and indirect detection methods which allows the technique to be extended to the area of trace metal analysis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Loss to {{follow-up}} (LTFU) {{challenges the}} success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up among pediatric patients. Little is known about children who drop out of care. We aim to analyze risk factors for LTFU among children on ART, find their true outcomes through tracing, and investigate their final outcomes after resuming ART. Methods: This is a descriptive, retrospective, cohort study of children on ART between April 2006 and December 2010 in 2 clinics in urban Malawi. Routine data from an electronic data system were used and matched with information obtained through <b>routine</b> <b>tracing</b> procedures. Results: Of 985 children (1999 child-years) on ART, 251 were LTFU: 12. 6 / 100 child-years. At ART initiation, wasting [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 1. 58 and 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 02 to 2. 44] was independently associated with higher risk of LTFU. Of 201 LTFU children traced, 79 % were found: 11 % died, 25 % stopped, 26 % transferred-out, and 37 % were still on ART. Median time between last visit and first tracing was 84 days (interquartile range: 64 – 101 days). Tracing reduced risk of LTFU by 38 % (AHR 0. 62 and 95 % CI: 0. 42 to 0. 91) and decreased LTFU from 23. 2 % to 8. 5 %. Additional outcomes of stop, death, and transfer-out increased 4. 4 -fold, 1. 8 -fold, and 1. 3 -fold, respectively. Traced children with gaps in ART intake who resumed ART had higher risk of stopping (AHR 4. 92 and 95 % CI: 1. 67 to 14. 5) and transfer out (AHR 2. 70 and 95 % CI: 1. 75 to 4. 17) as final outcome. Conclusions: Early tracing substantially reduces LTFU; approxi-mately one-third presumed LTFU {{was found to be}} still on ART. Children with wasting at initiation and those traced and found to have irregular ART intake require targeted interventions.

40|$|AMMA knife surgery {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} and used as a safe and effective treatment modality for various intracranial lesions {{during the past two}} dec-ades. 3, 9, 11 Because of its noninvasive nature, this procedure {{is considered one of the}} most suitable modalities to treat critically located lesions that are not easily accessible when using neurosurgical approaches. 9 Despite the benefits of ra-diosurgery, radiation-induced neuropathy, caused by exces-sive irradiation, is still a major concern for some patients. In treating critically located lesions, therefore, the strenuous endeavor has been made to diminish the risk of its compli-cations. With the aid of contemporary neuroimaging techniques, many critical intracranial structures such as cranial nerves can be well demarcated on imaging studies. In radiosurgi-cal treatment, the dose of radiation delivered to these struc-tures can be easily modified by taking into consideration the known tolerable radiation dose so as to avoid the possible risk of neurological deterioration. 3, 4, 7, 11 Despite recent ad-vances in neuroimaging, however, fiber connections in the white matter of the brain, including the CST, are difficult to <b>trace</b> accurately on <b>routine</b> neuroimaging studies. Thus, there has been no way to avoid excessive irradiation of white matter fiber tracts and, consequently, the radiation doses these fiber connections can tolerate are still unknown. Recently, we succeeded in visualizing fiber tracts in the white matter of the brain by integrating MR DT imaging studies and realized its clinical application. 6, 10 This tech-nique was also applied to GKS treatment planning. In this article we introduce this novel technique and elucidate the results of its initial clinical application. Clinical Material and Methods Visualization of the CST was retrospectively performed in seven patients who had previously undergone GKS for cerebral AVMs located adjacent to the CST (Table 1). All MR imaging studies were performed with the aid of a 1. 5 -tesla whole-body MR imaging unit with echo planar capa-bilities and a standard whole-head transmitter–receiver coi...|$|R
40|$|Inductively coupled plasma-mass {{spectrometry}} (ICP-MS) is {{a comparatively}} new technique {{which in the}} last few years has been increasingly used for the analysis of biological samples. The multi-element capabilities of ICP-MS have been demonstrated for the analysis of several biological fluids including serum, whole blood and urine. This thesis evaluates the use of ICP-MS for the <b>routine</b> <b>trace</b> element analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Although it is possible to introduce CSF directly into the pneumatic nebulizer of the ICP-MS a wet digestion method, using nitric acid with microwave or water bath heating, has been assessed in view of the safety precautions required when handling CSF (Appendix I). International standard reference material NIST SRM- 909 Human Serum was used to test the validity of this procedure. The results obtained were comparable to the certified data for the elements Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe and Mg. Additionally Rb and Zn results agreed with other literature values. Good recoveries (92 to 105 %) were obtained for the addition of Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Rb, Sr and Zn to CSF. Other elements were below the detection limit in the non-spiked CSF. A preliminary study of 163 CSF samples, obtained from patients undergoing routine lumbar punctures, gave elemental concentrations within the literature range. For multi-element scan mode many of the elements lay below the detection limit: Cd, Co, Sc, Sn and V at concentrations less than 1 ng ml- 1 and Hg less than 2 ng ml- 1. The reported values for Ba, Cs, Pb and Sb were less than 1 ng ml- 1. Elemental concentrations for Al, Cu, Rb, Sr and Zn were in the ng ml- 1 range and Mg, P, Ca and Br in the mug ml- 1 range. However, as a result of the lumbar puncture procedure only small sample volumes of CSF were obtained (from 0. 4 - 1. 5 ml). Thus two sample volumes were used in the analysis 0. 2 and 1. 0 ml. The 1. 0 ml sample volumes gave significantly lower elemental concentrations at the 95 % confidence limit than the 0. 2 ml volumes for the elements Mg, P, Ca, Cu and Br. These differences were not attributable to sample heterogeneity or pipetting errors. As a result of this and due to the necessity of changing ICP-MS instruments during this study the analytical performance of the ICP-MS was assessed. Detection limits at the ng ml- 1 level were obtained for most elements. The instrumental accuracy was checked by analyzing NIST SRM 1643 b Trace Elements in Water which gave comparable results to the certified data for V, Cr, Mn, Co, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb. A linear dynamic range from 1 ng ml- 1 to 5 mug ml- 1 was established for the elements analyzed. It was found that the analytical performance of ICP-MS was impaired by the introduction of matrix elements (Na, K, Ca, Mg, P and Br). Some spectral interferences were caused by the addition of these matrix elements, for example 40 Ar 23 Na+ on 63 Cu+. However, suppression and enhancement of the analyte signals were observed depending on instrument operating parameters, such as nebulizer flow rate (NFR). As a result of these studies the optimum NFR for analyzing biological fluids (such as CSF and serum) was determined to be between 700 and 950 ml min- 1. Although this NFR range did not provide the maximum analyte signal particularly for the low mass analytes, it did limit the spectroscopic and non-spectroscopic interferences. Preliminary studies in synthetic solutions showed that it was possible to correct for the matrix interferences with internal standards of similar mass to the analyte element. Several methods for correcting spectroscopic interferences were attempted: internal standards; standard addition; sample dilution; isotope dilution mass spectrometry and matrix matched standards. No one method was successful for all elements. Several elements could be determined namely. Mg, Rb, Cu and Sr and others depending on instrument fluctuations, blank contamination levels and their level in a particular CSF sample. These determinations could not be thought of as routine as correction procedures for the data varied from day to day as a result of instrument instability and signal drift, perhaps caused by the sample matrix. This study highlights the difficulty of using pneumatic nebulizer ICP-MS for the routine multi-element analysis of CSF...|$|R
