500|$|He {{started in}} Oxford's {{first game of}} the 2007–08 season, a 1–0 home win against Forest Green Rovers, coming on at half-time. Eight days later, he scored his first goal of the {{campaign}} in the club's 2–1 away win at the Pirelli Stadium against Burton Albion, latching onto Eddie Odhiambo's cross to score from six yards. He started his first game in a 0–0 draw against Stevenage at Broadhall Way in late August 2007, and started once more in a game against Altrincham at Moss Lane a month later, scoring in injury-time to seal a 3–1 victory, having previously assisted the first goal. Odubade's third goal of the campaign came in Oxford's 2–1 home win against Salisbury City, scoring from just inside the area. He also scored a consolation goal for Oxford in the club's 3–1 away loss to relegation candidates Droylsden, as well as scoring twice in the following game as Oxford raced into a three-goal lead against Torquay United, although the game ended 3–3. Odubade scored again against Northwich Victoria in the FA Cup in November 2007, but failed to net again until January 2008 – scoring Oxford's goal in a 3–1 loss away to Salisbury City. After a 0–0 draw against Grays Athletic, a game in which Odubade was substituted on 64 minutes, he failed to start a game for three months. Subsequently, in March 2008, he was transfer-listed by manager Darren Patterson. Shortly after Odubade had been transfer-listed, it was announced that he had played his last game for the club, with Patterson saying [...] "I think the best thing for him and us is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> our separate ways". However, just a week later, Odubade was told by Patterson that he [...] "must start producing performances" [...] if he wants to be taken off the transfer list. He was taken off of the list after scoring three goals in four games {{at the end of the}} season, as well as starting in the club's last two games of the season. Patterson said that Odubade was removed from the transfer list because [...] "he's now putting in a shift" [...] every game. He finished the season as Oxford's top goalscorer, as Oxford finished the season in ninth place. In total, Odubade played 43 games in all competitions, scoring 11 times as Oxford finished in ninth place.|$|E

She said [...] "That makes it real. The changes <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> through, the transitions <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> through, the tests <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> through, being a mother, becoming a single mother. It all had its ups and its downs, {{but for the most}} part, I kept my faith and I kept my head up... I took my time. All the triumphs and the ups and downs and stuff, it's all incorporated on the album, and hopefully not only does it inspire me, but inspires a whole lot of other people." ...|$|E

2500|$|On Thursday June 14, 2007, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mohamed ElBaradei, {{speaking}} {{at a meeting of}} the IAEA, said that war against Iran [...] "would be catastrophic, it would be an act of madness, and it would not solve the issue." [...] During the preceding several weeks, ElBaradei had several times expressed his opposition to a military attack on Iran. He made these statements as part of what he saw as his role as Director General of the IAEA, stating [...] "I have no brief other than to make sure we do not go into another war, or <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> crazy into killing each other." ...|$|E
2500|$|The onus of {{leadership}} fell on him, I said, {{and if he}} would seize the initiative, Washington and London would have to follow. That may have been somewhat naive, but I firmly believed, I wrote, that UNSCOM was fighting for its very existence as a meaningful disarmament body, and inspections aimed at uncovering concealment remained imperative. It was a fight worth fighting, I said, recommending <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> ahead with the planned inspections regardless of the naysayers, though not without continuing to seek support. [...] "In reengaging on concealment," [...] I concluded, [...] "the Special Commission will be waving a red flag {{in front of the}} Iraqi bull. It is essential that this red flag be backed by a sword, or else the commission {{will not be able to}} withstand the Iraqi charge. In short, the Special Commission's push on concealment must be 100 percent." ...|$|E

Stewart Parker, the Command and Control Special Forces {{commander}} at Bagram Air Base {{during the}} battle, said of Rhyner: [...] "Rhyner {{is out of}} training {{less than a year}} and is {{in one of the most}} difficult situations ... it is an absolute testament to his character and the training these guys take. It tells me we are doing something right." [...] During a Fox News interview with Glen Beck, Beck asked Rhyner [...] "... there are only — what is it? — 192 people who have ever received the Air Force Cross ... How do you put that together in your head? I mean, you are in a very elite group." [...] Rhyner simply replied with [...] "Any other combat controller put in the same situation would have performed in the same, exact way ... Credit that to the training we receive and the process <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> through to become a combat controller." [...] Future Air Force Cross recipient, and fellow Combat Controller, Robert Gutierrez was also present at the Battle of Shok Valley with Rhyner, albeit with a different Special Forces team, and regarding Rhyner's actions he said reportedly, [...] "If it wasn't for Zach, I wouldn't be here." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{cast and}} crew members warned the {{audience}} of the graphic content of the episode. Prior to the episode's release, certain scenes {{were reported to have}} been cut from the official broadcast, having been deemed too disturbing. The scenes remaining in the episode have been met with comparable observations by the show's actors. Steven Yeun, who portrays Glenn Rhee, said: I remember a couple of scenes I would look over at {{what was going on in}} the scene and I would be like, ‘What the eff? What are we doing? How is this legal? It's grounded and real, too; it's not like torture or gore for no reason. It's literally, that is what would happen and we are trying to show it. It would not work on network television, let me tell you that. Lauren Cohan, who portrays Maggie Greene, made similar comments regarding the episode, saying some of the scenes were [...] "so disturbing", she did not think they would make it on TV. The series' composer, Bear McCreary, tweeted to parents of young children: [...] "Do not let children watch The Walking Dead tonight. Or ever again. I'm very serious", as he is aware of the show's younger fans. Despite his warning, McCreary said that [...] "No Sanctuary" [...] was his [...] "favorite episode in years, and, , the scariest score I've ever done." [...] Series creator and executive producer Robert Kirkman stated that the episode's opening presented to the audience the threat that the characters face, although he said, [...] " [...] actually adds a tremendous amount of value to the story, and so that’s what justifies these great lengths <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> to to, you know, disgust the audience." [...] Gimple said that there was concern of the graphic nature of the episode, but both he and the network eventually felt it was necessary for the episode's plot, and that it contained meaning within the story. He also stated that the disturbing acts of the people in Terminus was important to convey the terror of [...] "institutional evil", saying: ...|$|E
