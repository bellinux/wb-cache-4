25|$|Debt held by {{government}} accounts or intragovernmental debt, such as non-marketable Treasury securities held in accounts {{administered by the}} federal government that are owed to program beneficiaries, such as <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>Fund.</b> Debt held {{by government}} accounts represents the cumulative surpluses, including interest earnings, of various government programs that have been invested in Treasury securities. Since 2016, this has comprised one-third of the US debt and originates from federal governmental spending in the form of mandatory spending programs,discretionary spending programs and unpaid interest the government owes to creditors.|$|E
25|$|CBO {{reported}} that net {{interest on the}} public debt was approximately $240 billion in FY2016 (6% of spending), an increase of $17 billion or 8% versus FY2015. A higher level of debt coincided with higher interest rates. During FY2012, the GAO reported a figure of $245 billion, down from $251 billion. Government also accrued a non-cash interest expense of $187 billion for intra-governmental debt, primarily <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>Fund,</b> for a total interest expense of $432 billion. GAO {{reported that}} even though the national debt rose in FY2012, the interest rate paid declined. Should interest rates rise to historical averages, the interest cost would increase dramatically.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} debt increased from $10.0 trillion in September 2008 to $19.6 trillion in September 2016. As described above, roughly $3 trillion of this increase was anticipated in the January 2009 CBO baseline forecast, or $6-8 trillion adjusting for {{the extension of}} the Bush tax cuts and other baseline overrides typically legislated. Obama ultimately extended the Bush tax cuts for approximately 98% of taxpayers as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, allowing taxes to rise on the top 1–2% of income earners. The debt held by the public (which excludes intra-governmental liabilities like <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>Fund)</b> rose from around 36% GDP in 2009 to 76% GDP in 2016, the highest level except for the post World War 2 era.|$|E

25|$|The 2011 {{annual report}} by the program's Board of Trustees noted the following: in 2010, 54 million people were {{receiving}} Social Security benefits, while 157 million people were paying into the fund; of those receiving benefits, 44 million were receiving retirement benefits and 10 million disability benefits. In 2011, there will be 56 million beneficiaries and 158 million workers paying in. In 2010, total income was $781.1 billion and expenditures were $712.5 billion, which meant a total net increase in assets of $68.6 billion. Assets in 2010 were $2.6 trillion, an amount {{that is expected to}} be adequate to cover the next 10 years. In 2023, total income and interest earned on assets are projected to no longer cover expenditures for Social Security, as demographic shifts burden the system. By 2035, the ratio of potential retirees to working age persons will be 37 percent—there will be less than three potential income earners for every retiree in the population. At this rate <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>Fund</b> would be exhausted by 2036.|$|E
2500|$|The {{national}} debt {{can also be}} classified into marketable or non-marketable securities. Most of the marketable securities are Treasury notes, bills, and bonds held by investors and governments globally. The non-marketable securities are mainly the [...] "government account series" [...] owed to certain government trust funds such as <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>Fund,</b> which represented $2.74 trillion in 2011.|$|E

Current year expenses are paid from current Social Security tax revenues. When revenues exceed expenditures, as they did between 1983 and 2009, the excess is invested in special series, non-marketable U.S. government bonds. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>Fund</b> indirectly finances the federal government's general purpose deficit spending. In 2007, the cumulative excess of Social Security taxes and interest received over benefits paid out stood at $2.2 trillion.

40|$|Excerpt] Each {{year when}} <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> {{trustees}} release their annual report, {{attention is focused}} on the projection of the year that <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>trust</b> funds will become insolvent. In their 2014 report, the Trustees projected that, under their intermediate assumptions and under current law, the Disability Insurance (DI) trust fund will become exhausted in 2016 and the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) trust fund will do so in 2034. Although the two funds are legally separate, they are often described in combination. The trustees project that <b>the</b> combined <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>trust</b> funds will become exhausted in 2033. Some Americans may believe that if the trust funds were exhausted, <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> would be unable to pay any benefits. In fact, in 2033, the first year of projected insolvency of <b>the</b> combined <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>trust</b> funds, <b>the</b> program is projected to have enough tax revenue to pay about 77 % of scheduled benefits; that percentage would decline to 72 % {{by the end of the}} 75 -year projection period. Although benefits would be paid in some form, it is unclear how the necessary reductions would be implemented, because <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> Act does not specify what would happen to benefits if a trust fund became exhausted. One option would be to pay full benefit checks on a delayed schedule; another would be to make timely but reduced payments. This report explains what <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>trust</b> funds are and how they work. It describes the historical operations of the <b>trust</b> funds and <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> trustees’ projections of future operations. It explains what could happen if Congress allowed the trust funds to run out. It also analyzes two scenarios that assume Congress waits until the moment of insolvency to act, showing the magnitude of benefit cuts or tax increases needed and how such changes would affect beneficiaries...|$|R

2500|$|Social Security is {{a social}} {{insurance}} program officially called [...] "Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance" [...] (OASDI), in reference to its three components. It is primarily funded through a dedicated payroll tax of 12.4%. During 2016, total benefits of $910 billion were paid out, versus $882 billion in 2015, an increase of $28 billion or 3%. Social Security's total expenditures have exceeded its non-interest income since 2010. The deficit of non-interest income relative to cost was about $49 billion in 2010, $45 billion in 2011, and $55 billion in 2012. During 2010, an estimated 157 million people paid into the program and 54 million received benefits, roughly 2.91 workers per beneficiary. [...] Since the Greenspan Commission in the early 1980s, Social Security has cumulatively collected far more in payroll taxes dedicated to the program than it has paid out to recipients—nearly $2.6 trillion in 2010. This annual surplus is credited to Social Security trust funds that hold special non-marketable Treasury securities. This surplus amount is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Social Security Trust Fund". The proceeds are paid into the U.S. Treasury where they may be used for other government purposes. Social Security spending will increase sharply over the next decades, largely due to the retirement of the baby boom generation. The number of program recipients is expected to increase from 44 million in 2010 to 73 million in 2030. Program spending is projected to rise from 4.8% of GDP in 2010 to 5.9% of GDP by 2030, where it will stabilize. The Social Security Administration projects that an increase in payroll taxes equivalent to 1.8% of the payroll tax base or 0.6% of GDP would be necessary to put the Social Security program in fiscal balance for the next 75 years. Over an infinite time horizon, these shortfalls average 3.3% of the payroll tax base and 1.2% of GDP. Various reforms have been debated for Social Security. Examples include reducing future annual cost of living adjustments (COLA) provided to recipients, raising the retirement age, and raising the income limit subject to the payroll tax ($118,500 in 2014). Because of the mandatory nature of the program and large accumulated surplus in <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>Fund,</b> the Social Security system has the legal authority to compel the government to borrow to pay all promised benefits through 2036, when the Trust Fund is expected to be exhausted. Thereafter, the program under current law will pay approximately 75–78% of promised benefits {{for the remainder of the}} century.|$|E
50|$|The {{accumulated}} surpluses are {{invested in}} special non-marketable Treasury securities (treasuries) {{issued by the}} U.S. government, which are deposited in <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>Fund.</b> At the end of 2009, the Trust Fund stood at $2.5 trillion. The $2.5 trillion amount owed {{by the federal government}} to <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>Fund</b> is also a component of the U.S. National Debt, which stood at $15.7 trillion as of May 2012.

In some sense this may seem like an antiquated question since 2016 is the last year when annual cash surpluses are expected to contribute to fund balances. But, in fact, the question is still very relevant because any attempt to restore solvency will likely again produce large surpluses for several decades. This brief explores the effectiveness of building up assets in <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>trust</b> funds. It first describes the economic rationale for such a buildup.
