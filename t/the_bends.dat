5|$|Later, when {{technological}} advances allowed {{the use of}} pressurization of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, compressed air illness, <b>the</b> <b>bends,</b> and decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS; {{also known}} as divers' disease, <b>the</b> <b>bends</b> or caisson disease) describes a condition arising from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation. DCS most commonly refers to problems arising from underwater diving decompression (i.e., during ascent), but may be experienced in other depressurisation events such as emerging from a caisson, flying in an unpressurised aircraft at altitude, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft. DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.|$|E
5|$|If the {{dissolved}} {{inert gases}} {{come out of}} solution within the tissues {{of the body and}} form bubbles, they may cause the condition known as decompression sickness, or DCS, also known as divers' disease, <b>the</b> <b>bends</b> or caisson disease. However, not all bubbles result in symptoms, and doppler bubble detection shows that venous bubbles are present in a significant number of asymptomatic divers after relatively mild hyperbaric exposures.|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of a qualifier, <b>the</b> term <b>bending</b> is {{ambiguous}} because bending can occur locally in all objects. Therefore, to make the usage of the term more precise, engineers refer to a specific object such as; <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> of rods, <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> of beams, <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> of plates, <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> of shells and so on.|$|R
5000|$|Or, if a smith {{needed to}} put a 90-degree bend in a bar and wanted a sharp corner {{on the outside of}} <b>the</b> <b>bend,</b> they would begin by {{hammering}} an unsupported end to make <b>the</b> curved <b>bend.</b> Then, to [...] "fatten up" [...] the outside radius of <b>the</b> <b>bend,</b> one or both arms of <b>the</b> <b>bend</b> would need to be pushed back to fill the outer radius of the curve. So they would hammer the ends of the stock down into <b>the</b> <b>bend,</b> 'upsetting' it at the point of <b>the</b> <b>bend.</b> They would then dress <b>the</b> <b>bend</b> by drawing <b>the</b> sides of <b>the</b> <b>bend</b> to keep <b>the</b> correct thickness. The hammering would continue—upsetting and then drawing—until the curve had been properly shaped. In the primary operation was <b>the</b> <b>bend,</b> but <b>the</b> drawing and upsetting are done to refine the shape.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the murder the area was a semirural rainforest. Morgan’s Corner is a bend on Nuuanu Pali Drive that {{connected}} Honolulu to Kāneʻohe before it was superseded by Hawaii Route 61. <b>The</b> <b>bend</b> is after a hairpin turn from the Honolulu side of <b>the</b> <b>bend.</b> Morgan’s Corner became referred to as a “corner” because <b>the</b> <b>bend</b> curves <b>the</b> road perpendicularly so that from Honolulu one enters <b>the</b> <b>bend</b> from <b>the</b> north and exits to the east or from Kāneʻohe one enters <b>the</b> <b>bend</b> from <b>the</b> east and exits to the north.

5|$|The Pipeline Authorization Act {{required}} the pipeline {{to be able}} to withstand the maximum earthquake ever recorded in the area it was built. When crossing the Denali Fault, Teflon-coated sliders were designed to allow the pipeline to move side-to-side in an earthquake. To protect against forward-and-backward shocks and to allow for thermal expansion, the pipeline wasn't designed as a straight line. Instead, it was intended to be laid in an S-shape, and <b>the</b> <b>bends</b> would allow for expansion and movement without breaking.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as salvage {{operations}} became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge footings operating under pressure in caissons and was initially called caisson disease; {{it was later}} renamed <b>the</b> <b>bends</b> because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to stoop. Early reports of the disease had been made {{at the time of}} Charles Pasley's salvage operation, but scientists were still ignorant of its causes.|$|E
5|$|From about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew {{with the}} concept of Cool Britannia and Britpop as a {{movement}} began to dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. Bands that had enjoyed some success during the mid-1990s, but were not really part of the Britpop scene, included The Verve and Radiohead. After the decline of Britpop they began to gain more critical and popular attention. The Verve's album Urban Hymns (1997) was a worldwide hit and their commercial peak before they broke up in 1999, while Radiohead - although having achieved moderate recognition with <b>The</b> <b>Bends</b> in 1995 - achieved near-universal critical acclaim with their experimental third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001).|$|E

5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{component}} of breathing gases to replace nitrogen, due its low solubility in fluids, especially in lipids. Gases are absorbed by the blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving, which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis. Due to its reduced solubility, little helium is taken into cell membranes, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in trimix or heliox, a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known as decompression sickness, or <b>the</b> <b>bends.</b> The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease in pressure of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} experimental work related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum pump. In the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation, but in later experiments, signs of what was later to become known as decompression sickness were observed. Later, when technological advances allowed the use of pressurisation of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, <b>the</b> <b>bends,</b> and decompression sickness. Once it was recognized that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that recompression could relieve the symptoms, further work showed {{that it was possible}} to avoid symptoms by slow decompression, and subsequently various theoretical models have been derived to predict low-risk decompression profiles and treatment of decompression sickness.|$|E
25|$|Rothschild and Martin {{looked for}} {{evidence}} that mosasaurs suffered from <b>the</b> <b>bends</b> {{as a result}} of their diving and ascent activities. Avascular necrosis resulting from <b>the</b> <b>bends</b> was completely absent in fossils of the genus Clidastes, suggesting that it preferred to stay near the surface. In contrast, Rothschild and Martin observed avascular necrosis in nearly every specimen of Platecarpus and Tylosaurus that they surveyed. The presence and ubiquity of the avascular necrosis is consistent with the idea that these were deep diving animals.|$|E
