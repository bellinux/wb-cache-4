5|$|New Year's Rockin' Eve {{returned}} to ABC the following New Year's Eve {{for the arrival}} of 2001. The 2000–01 edition also introduced a new primetime hour at 10:00p.m. ET/PT, which featured additional segments and music performances to lead into the main program. Clark felt positive about the program's expansion into primetime – believing that viewers, no matter where they were, wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on in Times Square on New Year's Eve. Clark was joined by Fox & Friends anchor Steve Doocy, and Michelle Madison as reporters in Times Square. Comedian Wayne Brady hosted concert segments in Hollywood, which included performances by Lonestar, Boyz II Men, 98 Degrees, Baha Men, and Third Eye Blind among others.|$|E

At the San Diego Comic Con 2014, Lawless' role {{was revealed}} to be that of Isabelle Hartley, a longtime S.H.I.E.L.D. veteran. About the decision to cast Lawless as Hartley, who was always intended to be killed off at the end of the episode, Whedon said [...] "We wanted you to invest in the character and feel like this person was a real equal to Coulson. She definitely fit the bill on that front. Lucy has such a strength to her. We didn’t want people <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen. We wanted it to feel like a big deal." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Martin's {{brilliance}} in evoking atmosphere through {{description is}} an enduring hallmark of his fiction, the settings {{much more than}} just props on a painted stage", and the novels captivate readers with [...] "complex storylines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing, and the willingness to kill off even his major characters". CNN remarked that [...] "the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style", and David Orr of The New York Times found that [...] "All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles." [...] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard [...] "couldn't stop reading Martin because my desire <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen combined with my absolute inability to guess what would happen and left me helpless before his sorcery. At the end, I felt shaken and exhausted." [...] The Christian Science Monitor advised reading the novels with an A Song of Ice and Fire encyclopedia at hand to [...] "catch all the layered, subtle hints and details that [...] leaves throughout his books. If you pay attention, you will be rewarded and questions will be answered." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{extensive}} connections of Kangura to {{the ruling}} elite appeared to give the magazine inside knowledge. [...] "People who might otherwise have ignored [...] paid attention, because Kangura seemed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen before it did," [...] stated Kenyan journalist Mary Kimani.|$|E
2500|$|Baird {{responded to}} Jordan's {{allegations}} by calling them [...] "the merest bosh" [...] and by denying {{there were any}} inducements or special favors for athletes. [...] He later noted: [...] "President Jordan has made these charges several times, and never brought forth one iota of proof to establish his claim." [...] Former Michigan player and then Drake coach, Willie Heston, {{one of the players}} named as a professional in Jordan's article, responded: [...] "I was in a position <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on and I believe that I am safe in saying that no Michigan athlete ever did anything since Baird took hold of things there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Faldo's {{decision}} to only appoint one vice-captain, {{instead of the}} usual four or five, was also met with doubts about his ability <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on in all the matches being played simultaneously. Faldo was accused by the media of being a [...] "loner" [...] and a [...] "control freak", thus also contributing to the team's failings. In an interview with the British Daily Mail newspaper in 2012, Faldo said of his Ryder Cup captaincy: [...] "The bottom line is that it was a tough experience and very tough for me to deal with afterwards." [...] The Daily Mail described Europe's 2008 Ryder Cup defeat as [...] "a calamitous loss".|$|E

2500|$|Timothy White explained, [...] "Larry {{lived his}} art. [...] There’s {{no doubt about}} it. [...] His life was his art". [...] Having {{experienced}} and overcome many extreme tests in life, Indian Larry adopted the question mark as his life logo. Larry [...] "had {{a lot going on}} in his head", and was by nature analytical, and a deep thinker. [...] But ultimately he thought that one should just [...] "roll with the mystery", and [...] "live in the moment". [...] Larry often expressed to those around him that he didn't pretend <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on.

2500|$|Despite a {{temporary}} cooling of {{tensions in the}} Irish camp after Keane's change of heart, things soon took {{a turn for the}} worse. Keane immediately gave an interview to leading sports journalist Tom Humphries, of the Irish Times newspaper, where he expressed his unhappiness with the facilities in Saipan and listed the events and concerns which had led him to leave the team temporarily. McCarthy took offence at Keane's interview and decided to confront Keane over the article in front of the entire squad and coaching staff. Keane refused to relent, saying that he had told the newspaper what he considered to be the truth and that the Irish fans deserved <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on inside the camp. He then unleashed a stinging verbal tirade against McCarthy: [...] "Mick, you're a liar... you're a fucking wanker. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks." [...] Niall Quinn observed in his autobiography that [...] "Roy Keane's 10-minute oration ... was clinical, fierce, earth-shattering to the person on the end of it and it ultimately caused a huge controversy in Irish society." [...] But at the same time, he was also critical of Keane's stance, saying that, [...] " [...] left us in Saipan, not the other way round. And he punished himself more than any of us by not coming back." ...|$|E

60|$|Old Ben relapsed {{into another}} spasm, and Toby {{talked to the}} monkey, who chattered back at him, until the boys on the ground were in a perfect ferment of anxiety <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on.|$|E

60|$|THE {{ship out}} of the way, we were quite anxious <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to be done with}} us.

60|$|There was no {{good reason}} why all of us lads should linger in the cabin, and every cause {{for us to go}} forth to keep an eye over the enemy, {{therefore}} when I said that it stood us in hand <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on, even at the expense of losing our breakfast which was not yet cooked, Pierre, seemingly having grown careless, insisted that Saul should come with us.|$|E
