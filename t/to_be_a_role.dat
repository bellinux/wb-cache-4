500|$|Workman, {{herself an}} ardent feminist and a {{supporter}} of women's suffrage, wanted her readers to understand how her contributions and achievements reflected all women's potential. In her writings, Workman described herself as [...] "questioning or violating the norms of Victorian female propriety". She demonstrated that women were strong enough to thrive outside the home by showing {{how easy it was}} for her to endure strenuous physical activities like bicycling long distances in hot, humid places or mountaineering in cold temperatures and high altitudes. Workman challenged a masculine realm; her obituary in the Alpine Journal alluded to the challenges she faced, saying that she [...] "felt that she suffered from 'sex antagonism'". The author of the piece added: [...] "it is possible that some unconscious feeling let us say of the novelty of a woman's intrusion into the domain of exploration so long reserved to man, may in some quarters have existed... there tended to arise... an atmosphere shall we say of aloofness?" [...] However, in her study of Victorian mountaineering, Ann Colley suggests that gender discrimination was more overt at lower elevations and in regular life than at higher elevations, such as in the Himalaya. Colley states, [...] "Away from such petty opinion emanating from society pressures, up high, above the snow line or in distant regions, women climbers could more fully experience equality and power... If they chose, they could be just as sportsmanlike or competitive as the men." [...] In her entry about Workman in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Tingley sums Workman up as [...] "an aggressive, determined, and uncompromising turn-of-the-century American woman traveler" [...] and [...] "one of the first women to work as a professional mountaineer and surveyor and to write about the expeditions she and her husband took to the most remote reaches of the Himalaya. She was an outspoken advocate of woman's suffrage and made it clear that she considered herself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> model for other women travelers and mountaineers." ...|$|E
