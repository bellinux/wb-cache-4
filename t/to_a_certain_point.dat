5|$|Professor Layton and the Last Specter is {{a puzzle}} game {{presented}} {{in the style of}} an adventure game. The player controls the actions of a group of three protagonists as they move about a village called Misthallery: Professor Hershel Layton, his assistant Emmy Altava, and a young boy named Luke Triton. While in the village, the three of them are presented with several mysteries that are solved as the plot progresses. Misthallery is divided into several sections, although many require the plot to progress <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> before they can be accessed. In order to move about Misthallery, players tap a shoe-shaped icon on the bottom-right corner of the touch screen, and then the arrow representing the direction of the path they wish to take. While in Misthallery, the player is capable of tapping anywhere on the bottom screen of the Nintendo DS system to investigate objects and reveal bits of dialogue, hint coins, collectible items, or hidden puzzles. Likewise, if a non-player character is visible on the screen, they can be tapped to initiate a conversation.|$|E

If a similar border exists for Group-IQ or if advantages are linear and infinite, has still to be explored. Similarly, demand for further research on possible connections of individual and collective intelligence exists within plenty of other potentially transferable logics of individual intelligence, such as, for instance, the development over time or the question of improving intelligence. Whereas it is controversial whether human intelligence can be enhanced via training, a group's collective intelligence potentially offers simpler opportunities for improvement by exchanging team members or implementing structures and technologies. Moreover, social sensitivity was found to be, at least temporarily, improvable by reading literary fiction as well as watching drama movies. In how far such training ultimately improves collective intelligence through social sensitivity remains an open question.|$|E

25|$|Learned {{helplessness}} theory {{posits that}} because human bodies are only alterable <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point,</b> people {{develop a sense}} of body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling of helplessness in relation to correcting their physical appearance and helplessness in being able to control the way in which others perceive their appearance. This lack of control often results in depression. In relating to a lack of motivation, objectification theory states that women have less control in relationships and the work environment because they have to depend on the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another's evaluation limits a woman's ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression. Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day wears on a woman, and sometimes results in a state of depression.|$|E

500|$|For the 1892 season, Hirst joined Huddersfield, {{which played}} a higher {{standard}} of cricket. Yorkshire also gave him a longer run in the first team. Early in the season, Hirst appeared for Yorkshire against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Not considered a good batsman at this stage, he batted at number 11 in the first innings, scored 20 and 43 not out and, as a bowler, took four wickets for 29 runs (four for 29) and two for 58. His bowling performance particularly impressed Sydney Pardon, the editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. Yorkshire, needing to fill a vacant place in the team, played Hirst 13 times in first-class matches in 1892. He did not pass 30 runs in an innings again and averaged 16.15 with the bat. With the ball, he took 30 wickets at an average of 20.56 with a best performance of six for 16 against Sussex. Wisden later noted that Hirst, until he tired later in the season and was dropped from the team, [...] "bowled up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> with excellent results".|$|E
500|$|Getting {{funding for}} the project was {{difficult}} because of the taboos against death, and the crew had to approach several companies before Departures was approved by Toshiaki Nakazawa and Yasuhiro Mase. According to the film's director, Yōjirō Takita, a consideration in taking on the film was {{the age of the}} crew: [...] "we got <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> in our lives when death was creeping up to become a factor around us". Kundō Koyama was enlisted to provide the script, his first for a feature film; his previous experience had been in scripting for television and stage. Takita, who had begun his career in the pink film genre before entering mainstream filmmaking in 1986 with Comic Magazine, took on the director's role in 2006, after producer Toshiaki Nakazawa presented him with the first draft of the script. In a later interview he stated [...] "I wanted to make a film {{from the perspective of a}} person who deals with something so universal and yet is looked down upon, and even discriminated against". Although he knew of the encoffining ceremony, he had never seen one performed.|$|E

L. Murdoch in 1882." [...] and that [...] "Darling proved himself one of the very best captains that ever took a team into the field." [...] The Australians lost only three of the 35matches they played on the tour, winning 16 and another 16 finishing in draws. [...] The only Test to reach a decisive result was the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia won by ten wickets due in part to centuries by Hill and Victor Trumper and a ten wicket haul by fast bowler Ernie Jones. [...] Aside from Hill, Darling was seen by Wisden as the best batsman among the Australians. Wisden claimed, [...] "Up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> the responsibilities of captaincy seemed to tell against Darling, but during the last weeks of the tour he played marvellous cricket." [...] Over the tour, he scored 1941 runs at an average of 41.29, topping both the averages and the aggregate for his team, and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Sapolsky has {{extensively}} studied baboons {{in their}} natural environment in the Serengeti in Africa. He noticed that baboons have very similar hierarchies in their society as do humans. They spend very few hours searching for food and fulfilling their primary needs leaving them with time to develop their social network. In primates mental stresses {{show up in the}} body. Primates experience psychological stresses that can elicit physiological responses that overtime can make them sick. Sapolsky observed the baboon's ranks, personalities and social affiliations then collected blood samples of the baboons to control the cortisol (stress hormone) levels of the baboons then matched social position to cortisol levels. Most of the data have been collected from male baboons because at any given time 80 percent of the females were pregnant. [...] Three factors influenced a baboon's cortisol levels; friendships, perspective and rank. [...] Baboons that played with infants and cultivated friendships, could tell if a situation was a real threat and could tell {{if they were going to}} win or lose, and were top ranking had lower levels of cortisol. Cortisol levels rise with age and hippocampal cells express fewer hormone receptors on their surface to protect themselves from excess, making it harder to control stress levels. [...] Cortisol levels are elevated in half of people suffering from major depression, it is the hippocampal region that is affected by both. Stress can have negative effects on gastrointestinal function causing ulcers, and it can also decrease sex drive, effect sleeping patterns and elevate blood pressure but it can also stimulate and motivate. When animals experience stress they are generally more alert than when they are not stressed. It may help them be better aware of unfamiliar environments and possible threats to their life in these environments. [...] Yerkes and Dodson developed a law that explains the empirical relationship between arousal and performance illustrated by and inverted U-shape graph. [...] According to the Yerkes-Dodson Law performance increases as does cognitive arousal but only <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point.</b> The downward part of the U-shape is caused by stress and as stress increases so does efficiency and performance but <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point.</b> [...] When stress becomes too great performance and efficiency decline. Sapolsky has also studied stress in rats and his results indicate that early experiences in young rats have strong, lasting effects. Rats that were exposed to human handling (stressful situation) had finely tuned stress responses that may have lowered their lifetime exposure to stress hormones compared to those that were not handled. In short stress can be adaptive. The more exposure to stressful situations the better the rat can handle that situation.|$|E
