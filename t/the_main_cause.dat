40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in Potchefstroom Hospital, situated in North-West Province, for 2000 - 2002. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> of maternal deaths in Potchefstroom Hospital were determined and compared to <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> for maternal deaths nationally. Methods: Data were collected in a retrospective manner from Potchefstroom Hospital's yearbooks and statistics, 2000 - 2002. The number of deliveries per month, the total number of maternal deaths and <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> for these deaths were recorded. Results: The MMR for Potchefstroom Hospital in 2000 - 2002 was 354. 7 / 100000 live births, compared to the estimated MMR for SA in 1999 - 2001 of 170 - 200 / 100 000 live births. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> of maternal deaths in Potchefstroom Hospital include non-pregnancy-related infection (mainly AIDS), complications of hypertension in pregnancy, obstetrical haemorrhage, pre-existing maternal disease and pregnancy-related sepsis. Conclusions: <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> for maternal deaths in Potchefstroom Hospital correlated well with <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> nationally. Of interest was that, compared to national statistics, there was a higher percentage of indirect causes of maternal death (mainly due to HIV/AIDS) than direct causes of deaths in Potchefstroom Hospital. However, it has been observed nationally that the percentage of indirect deaths compared to direct deaths is on the increase. This national trend is caused by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. General recommendations are made, which can be instituted to help lower the MMR in Potchefstroom Hospital and nationally. Articl...|$|R

5|$|It is {{considered}} that overeating {{and lack of}} muscle tone is <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>cause</b> of a beer belly, rather than beer consumption. A 2004 study, however, found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly. But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself. Several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index of 110, the same as maltose; however, the maltose in beer undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.|$|E

5|$|A recent threat, first {{reported}} in 1978, is forest dieback. In some areas, {{especially in the}} peripheral region, this has been severe with nearly a 50% in vegetation. Water deficiency has been attributed as <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>cause</b> of dieback as droughts are becoming more frequent. Regrowth of forest is hindered by frost which is increasingly severe. The forest dieback has affected 22 species of plants with Calophyllum walkeri being the most affected. A study has suggested that low calcium causes soil acidification and increased toxicity caused by metallic elements such as aluminium may be causing the dieback. Leaching of nutrients and the resulting imbalance in soil micronutrients may also be contributing to the dieback.|$|E

5|$|Anaemia {{is a major}} {{global health}} problem for women. Women are {{affected}} more than men, in which up to 30% of women being found to be anaemic and 42% of pregnant women. Anaemia is linked {{to a number of}} adverse health outcomes including a poor pregnancy outcome and impaired cognitive function (decreased concentration and attention). <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>cause</b> of anaemia is iron deficiency. In United States women iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 37% of pregnant women, but globally the prevalence is as high as 80%. IDA starts in adolescence, from excess menstrual blood loss, compounded by the increased demand for iron in growth and suboptimal dietary intake. In the adult woman, pregnancy leads to further iron depletion.|$|E

5|$|During the {{campaign}} to conquer the Itza of Petén, the Spanish sent expeditions to harass and relocate the Mopan north of Lake Izabal and the Ch'ol Maya of the Amatique forests to the east.

By {{the latter half of the}} 18th century the indigenous population of these towns had disappeared; the local inhabitants now consisted entirely of Spaniards, mulattos and others of mixed race, all associated with the Castillo de San Felipe de Lara fort guarding the entrance to Lake Izabal. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>cause</b> of the drastic depopulation of Lake Izabal and the Motagua Delta was the constant slave raids by the Miskito Sambu of the Caribbean coast that effectively ended the Maya population of the region; the captured Maya were sold into slavery in the British colony of Jamaica.|$|E
