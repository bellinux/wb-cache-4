5|$|Pike rides {{off with}} Dutch Engstrom, {{brothers}} Lyle and Tector Gorch, and Angel, the only survivors. They are dismayed when the loot from the robbery <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a decoy: steel washers instead of silver coin. The men reunite with old-timer Freddie Sykes {{and head for}} Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Theseus, {{eager to}} please his fiancee, Hippolyta, {{and the rest of}} his court, chooses Pyramus and Thisbe despite Philostrate's efforts. Because of its amateurishness, the play <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> humorous.|$|E

50|$|Advani {{says that}} the film <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 'Phir Subah Hogi'. Advani says that after Vajpayee became PM, he told party workers that {{the title of the}} movie had <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prophetic and there was finally dawn.|$|R
5000|$|This last {{procedure}} is the Arnoldi iteration. The Lanczos algorithm then arises as the simplification one gets from eliminating calculation steps that <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> trivial when [...] is Hermitian—in particular {{most of the}} [...] coefficients <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> zero.|$|R
5|$|As well as this, {{an entire}} {{sequence}} involving Tremble {{going to the}} front for the underground James Bond training school (which <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> under Harrods, of which the training area was the lowest level) was never shot, thus creating an abrupt cut from Vesper announcing that Tremble will be James Bond to Tremble exiting the lift into the training school.|$|E
5|$|McKinsey & Company has {{traditionally}} charged approximately 25 {{percent more than}} competing firms with an average project of one million dollars. Prices were reduced in the economic slump following the dot-com bubble. According to The Globe and Mail, McKinsey clients estimate that the firm's advice <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> poor in retrospect about 10 to 20 percent of the time.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Tony Gardner) {{owns and}} runs the café that Rick and Marty {{frequently}} visit {{to escape the}} chaos of Rick's home. He is socially awkward, possibly {{to the extent of}} having a mental disorder, although he was actually a high-flying city banker who suffered from burn-out. His father <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gay in later series, to which Michael reacts negatively.|$|E

50|$|Later leads have <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dead ends. In 2004, {{acting on}} a tip {{reportedly}} received from an inmate at the county jail, the sheriff's office began digging at an intersection in Lawndale. The bones that <b>were</b> found <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> from an animal.|$|R
5|$|Surrounding that level, on November 27, 2001 the Hubble Space Telescope {{detected}} sodium, {{the first}} planetary atmosphere outside the Solar System to be measured. This detection was predicted by Sara Seager in late 2001. The {{core of the}} sodium line runs from pressures of 50 millibar to a microbar. This <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> about a third the amount of sodium at HD 189733 b.|$|E
5|$|The crucial {{property}} <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treewidth, {{a measure}} of how tree-like the graph is. For a graph G of treewidth at most k and a graph H, the homomorphism problem can be solved in time |V(H)|O(k) with a standard dynamic programming approach. In fact, it is enough to assume that the core of G has treewidth at most k. This holds even if the core is not known.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens in}} medias res as former Sheriff Deputy Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) scavenges for gas and {{supplies}} at an abandoned convenience store in rural Georgia on a deserted highway. He spots {{a little girl}} (Addy Miller), but she <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a zombie. When she charges towards him, Rick shoots her in the head.|$|E
50|$|The design also <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unsatisfactory. The {{network of}} {{corridors}} was so labyrinthine {{that even the}} warders got lost; and the ventilation system allowed sound to carry, so that prisoners could communicate between cells. The annual running costs <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an unsupportable £16,000.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much," [...] {{answered}} {{the real estate}} dealer's son. [...] "The police thought they had one or two clues, but they have all <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> false.

5000|$|Over time, some began <b>to</b> {{suspect it}} <b>was</b> a hoax. Mike and Diane looked older than 18 and {{appeared}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> actors. [...] "Mike" [...] <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an Alabama actor Ty Taylor and [...] "Diane" [...] <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Michelle Parma, a former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader.|$|R
5|$|The natives' {{relationship}} with the sailors is initially cordial, so Too-Wit and the captain begin trading. Their friendliness, however, <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a ruse and {{on the eve of}} the ship's proposed departure, the natives ambush the crew in a narrow gorge. Everyone except Pym and Peters is slaughtered, and the Jane Guy is overrun and burned by the malevolent tribe.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} {{evolution}} equations is intimately tied in with {{another aspect of}} general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, it <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main {{reason is that the}} gravitational field—like any physical field—must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.|$|E
5|$|Amira goes to Yusef for help, {{saying she}} needs him on her side, {{threatening}} to tell Zainab that Yusef {{bought her a}} plane ticket {{if he does not}} help her get Syed back. She convinces Zainab to talk to Yusef, and when Yusef sees 15-year-old Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe), who has recently come out as homosexual, running out of Christian's flat, he asks if Christian acted inappropriately. At first Ben says nothing happened but later Ben tells Yusef that Christian touched him, and they tell Ben's father, Phil. This <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> untrue, but leads to Christian leaving Syed and Walford.|$|E

5|$|Another {{approach}} {{starts with}} the canonical quantization procedures of quantum theory. Using the initial-value-formulation of general relativity (cf. evolution equations above), {{the result is the}} Wheeler–deWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrödinger equation) which, regrettably, <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ill-defined without a proper ultraviolet (lattice) cutoff. However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables, this leads to a promising model known as loop quantum gravity. Space is represented by a web-like structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.|$|E
5|$|Bond later {{scales the}} walls to the Whyte House's top floor to confront Whyte. He is instead met by two {{identical}} Blofelds, who use an electronic device to sound like Whyte. Bond kills one of the Blofelds, which <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a look-alike. The real Blofeld pulls a gun on Bond, and instructs him into a elevator, where he is knocked out by gas. He is picked up by Wint and Kidd, and taken out to Las Vegas Valley, where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. The pipeline is buried the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Desperate for {{something}} to put on, Leslie tells Mark that he should propose to Ann {{in front of the}} camera and he agrees. Not long after, however, Ann confides in Leslie that she wants to break up with Mark, citing that he is simply not the one. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) tries to make Andy jealous by flirting with someone over the phone, but it backfires when it <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Joe (Kirk Fox) from the Pawnee sewer department. Andy is forced to kick Joe out of the studio when he actually arrives to bring April to his van.|$|E

Admitting defeat, Porky allows Sleepy to audition.|$|R

5|$|Disheartened, David {{falls from}} a ledge, but is rescued by Joe using their amphibicopter. David tells Joe {{he saw the}} Blue Fairy {{underwater}} and wants {{to go down to}} meet her. Joe is captured by the authorities using an electromagnet. David and Teddy use the amphibicopter to go to the Fairy, which <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a statue at Coney Island. The two become trapped when the Wonder Wheel falls on their vehicle. David asks repeatedly to be turned into a real boy until the ocean freezes and is deactivated once his power source is drained.|$|E
5|$|Everyone is {{in disbelief}} that Stewie {{would try to}} murder Lois, but she insists that he is evil, and {{explains}} what happened. After falling overboard, she was rescued by a merman. Having developed retrograde amnesia, she starts working at a fat camp in North Carolina. While in a diner, she meets a new boyfriend, who <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a white supremacist. While at a white supremacist rally, she takes {{a blow to the}} head and regains her memory, at which point she returns to Quahog.|$|E
5|$|Fate {{intervenes}} {{one night}} at a club, where the Castillo brothers have a part-time job. Nestor's love ballad captures the interest {{of one of the}} customers, who <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the Cuban bandleader and American television star Desi Arnaz (played by his son, Desi Arnaz, Jr.). After a pleasant evening in Nestor and Delores's home, Arnaz generously invites the struggling Castillos to sing and act on an episode of his smash sitcom series, I Love Lucy.|$|E
