5|$|According to CP+B {{employee}} Tom Zukoszki, {{the fictional}} background {{information for the}} band was that they signed with Burger King instead of a major record label. As part of the promotion, a four-song LP record was recorded, two music videos produced, and a national (US) tour planned. The tour had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cancelled</b> because the actor playing the lead singer, a Canadian citizen, was unable to enter the United States {{because he had a}} criminal record in his home country.|$|E

5|$|William III {{commissioned}} Nicholas Hawksmoor and Sir Christopher Wren {{to conduct}} a large, final classical remodelling of the Upper Ward, but the king's early death caused the plan <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cancelled.</b> Queen Anne was fond of the castle, and attempted to address {{the lack of a}} formal garden by instructing Henry Wise to begin work on the Maestricht Garden beneath the North Terrace, which was never completed. Anne also created the racecourse at Ascot and began the tradition of the annual Royal Ascot procession from the castle.|$|E
5|$|A common {{situation}} in ski jumping, and especially ski flying {{due to the}} magnified risks overall, arises when unfavourable weather conditions cause a competition to be cut short or cancelled completely; it is also not uncommon for an entire event <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cancelled.</b> Reasons include strong winds, a lack of (or too much) snow, and poor visibility for athletes or judges. In {{the case of a}} shortened competition, the scores from the first round – if completed – are used to determine the final result. This is called a single-round competition and still counts towards both the Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup. For the World Championships, if one of the two competitions is cancelled, the final result will be based on the competition that took place.|$|E

5|$|A further {{tour of the}} US {{was planned}} for December 1976, but it had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cancelled</b> when, on 23 November, Brian Robertson {{suffered}} a hand injury when trying to protect fellow Glaswegian, singer and friend Frankie Miller in a fracas at the Speakeasy Club in London. Miller had been jamming onstage with the reggae band Gonzalez, but had been drunk, offending Gonzalez guitarist Gordon Hunte. Hunte attacked Miller with a bottle in the dressing room, and Robertson intervened, suffering artery and nerve damage to his hand. Robertson subsequently broke Hunte's leg, broke the collarbone of another man, and headbutted another, before being hit {{on the head with}} a bottle, rendering him unconscious.|$|E
5|$|He rejoined Weymouth on loan in March until 24 April {{and made}} his debut in a 2–0 defeat to Kettering Town. He {{finished}} the season with eight appearances for Weymouth, while the club was relegated to the Conference South. After making two appearances for Wrexham, he was released on 8 June, after agreeing a deal for his contract <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cancelled.</b> He then re-signed for Weymouth for the 2009–10 season on a permanent contract in June. Critchell left Weymouth in November to join local rivals and hometown club Dorchester Town. He finished the season with 20 appearances for Dorchester. Critchell made 40 appearances and scored three goals in the 2010–11 season.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1954, 706 Squadron, a second-line unit, flew aboard {{to conduct}} {{trials of the}} anti-submarine version of the Whirlwind helicopter. They were {{successful}} enough that the squadron was redesignated as 845 Squadron afterwards and Perseus ferried them to Malta in April. The ship continued on to deliver relief supplies to Singapore intended for Korea and was reduced to reserve again upon her return on 12 July. The Admiralty intended to convert her to a submarine depot ship and she was towed to Belfast to begin work in 1955. The cutbacks from the 1957 Defence White Paper caused the conversion <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cancelled</b> and the ship was towed to Gare Loch to await a decision on the ship's disposition. Perseus sold for scrap in May 1958 and towed to Port Glasgow to begin demolition.|$|E

5|$|The Burnley {{board had}} planned {{a tour of}} Spain to take place {{during the summer of}} 1921 after the {{culmination}} of the league campaign. However, the trip had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cancelled</b> when the club received notice from the Spanish Football Federation that one of their intended opponents, Barcelona, had been suspended from all matches. Further tours of Norway and France were then arranged, but these also had to be abandoned after the Football Association refused to grant permission. At {{the end of the season}} five players were given free transfers by the club; Len Smelt and Frank Birchenough, who had both played for Burnley during the campaign, and three reserve players. Moreover, two players–Bert Freeman and George Thompson–were placed on the transfer list by the manager.|$|E
5|$|The First World War had {{a severe}} effect on Stanford. He was frightened by air-raids, {{and had to}} move from London to Windsor to avoid them. Many of his former pupils were {{casualties}} of the fighting, including Arthur Bliss, wounded, Ivor Gurney, gassed, and George Butterworth, killed. The annual RCM operatic production, which Stanford had supervised and conducted every year since 1885, had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cancelled.</b> His income declined, as the fall in student numbers at the college reduced the demand for his services. After a serious disagreement {{at the end of}} 1916, his relationship with Parry deteriorated to the point of hostility. Stanford's magnanimity, however, came to the fore when Parry died two years later and Stanford successfully lobbied for him to be buried in St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|The {{hill was}} used for 31 tournaments, of which six had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cancelled</b> because of wind or snow conditions. The tournaments {{included}} the Norwegian Championships in 1973, 1978 and 1983; the Norwegian champions in Balbergbakken were Nils-Per Skarseth (1973) and Per Bergerud (1978 and 1983). A FIS Ski Jumping World Cup race was held on 9 March 1984. It saw Pavel Ploc win ahead of Matti Nykänen and Ernst Vettori. The event drew 5,000 spectators. The World Cup race incurred a large loss, with the organizers only covering half of the NOK260,000 it cost to host. The hill record was set by Tom Levorstad in 1981, who reached 130.5meters. The final race {{was scheduled to be}} the 1992 Junior Norwegian Championships, but they were canceled because of lack of snow.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan for}} the {{extension}} to Camberwell was kept alive throughout the 1930s and, in 1940, the permission was used to construct sidings beyond Elephant & Castle. After the Second World War, the plans were revised again, with stations located under Walworth Road and Camberwell Green, and the extension appeared on tube maps in 1949. Rising construction costs caused by difficult ground conditions and restricted funds in the post-war austerity period led the scheme <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cancelled</b> again in 1950. Various proposals have been evaluated since, including an extension to Peckham considered in the early 1970s, but the costs have always out-weighed the benefits.|$|E
5|$|Waters began touring {{in support}} of the album, aided by Clapton, a new band, new material, and a {{selection}} of Pink Floyd favourites. Waters débuted his tour in Stockholm on 16 June 1984. Poor ticket sales plagued the tour, and some of the larger venues had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cancelled.</b> By his own estimate, he lost £400,000 on the tour. In March 1985, Waters went to North America to play smaller venues with the Pros and Cons Plus Some Old Pink Floyd Stuff—North America Tour 1985. The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking has been certified Gold by the RIAA.|$|E
5|$|After {{its season}} in London the company {{performed}} in Vienna, Budapest, Prague and Berlin. The tour was successful, artistically and financially, {{but was not}} without untoward incident. A planned visit to St Petersburg had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cancelled</b> because the Narodny Dom theatre burned down, and in Vienna the Philharmonic was unequal to the difficulties of the score of Petrushka. The illustrious orchestra revolted at the rehearsal for the first performance, refusing to play for Monteux; only an intervention by Diaghilev restored the rehearsal, {{by the end of}} which Monteux was applauded and Stravinsky given an ovation. In the middle of the tour Monteux was briefly summoned back to Paris by the Concerts Colonne, which had the contractual right to recall him, to deputise for Pierné; his own deputy, Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht, took temporary musical charge of the Ballets Russes.|$|E
