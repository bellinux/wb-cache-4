5|$|An oil tanker, {{also known}} as a {{petroleum}} tanker, is a merchant ship designed for the bulk transport of oil. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>basic</b> types of oil tankers: crude tankers and product tankers. Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries. For example, moving crude oil from oil wells in Nigeria to the refineries on the coast of the United States. Product tankers, generally much smaller, are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets. For example, moving gasoline from refineries in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and other West African nations.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>basic</b> {{aerodynamic}} {{models of}} insect flight. Most insects use {{a method that}} creates a spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling and clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, {{at the price of}} wear and tear on the wings.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>basic</b> {{forms of}} data packet, DATA0 and DATA1. A data packet {{must always be}} preceded by an address token, and is usually {{followed}} by a handshake token from the receiver back to the transmitter. The two packet types provide the 1-bit sequence number required by stop-and-wait ARQ. If a USB host does not receive a response (such as an ACK) for data it has transmitted, it does not know if the data was received or not; the data might have been lost in transit or {{it might have been}} received but the handshake response was lost.|$|E

During the history of Christianity, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>basic</b> types of autonomy. Some important parishes and monasteries have been given special autonomous rights and privileges, and the best known example of monastic autonomy is the famous Eastern Orthodox monastic community on Mount Athos in Greece. On the other hand, administrative autonomy of entire ecclesiastical provinces has throughout history included various degrees of internal self-governance.|$|R
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>basic</b> {{hypothesis}} {{as to how}} Ithaca Chasma formed. One {{of them is that}} {{it formed}} as Tethys' internal liquid water ocean solidified, causing the moon to expand and cracking its surface to accommodate the extra volume within. Earlier craters made before Tethys solidified were probably all erased by geological activity before then.|$|E

The differences arose for historical reasons as discussed in the article Mains electricity.|$|E

40|$|Not {{all that}} long ago, {{considerable}} intellectual energy was spent across Australia analysing the formation of trade policy. And much as elsewhere, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>basic</b> approaches. The first approach focussed {{on the evolution of}} {{the rules of the game}} in multilateral trade, stepping from the assumption that national policy was essentially an autonomous instrument designed to leverage those rules in directions broadly favourable to local industries. The second approach consisted of tracking the course of pressure group politics, and worked on the assumption that national policy was the vector outcome of many conflicting interests...|$|R
