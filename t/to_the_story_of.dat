5|$|A {{sequel to}} the game, Super Paper Mario, was {{developed}} by Intelligent Systems and released for the Wii in 2007. It has a stronger emphasis on platforming than its predecessor. Super Paper Marios plot is unrelated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> The Thousand-Year Door, but it contains many easter eggs referencing characters from the previous two games.|$|E
5|$|A {{theatrical}} {{movie was}} announced {{shortly after the}} anime series, acting as a conclusion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> Blood-C. Titled , it released in Japanese theaters on June 2, 2012. A live-action prequel set during the military regime of pre-World War II Japan, titled Asura Girl: Blood-C Another Story, is set for release in 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} {{inspired}} by actual events in Alton, Texas in 1989. It was filmed in British Columbia and Ontario, incorporating a film score with medieval music influences and references <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> The Pied Piper of Hamelin.|$|E

5|$|Commenting on {{the usage}} of Tantrism, The New Indian Express Kruthi Grover found {{the death of the}} sorcerer similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> Bhasmasur, a demon in Indian mythology to whom Shiva gives the power to reduce a person to ashes by {{touching}} her or his head. When Bhasmasur tries to touch Shiva's head, Vishnu assumes the form of Mohini and makes Bhasmasur touch his own head, killing him. According to Malathi Rangarajan, the film's themes of Tantrism and black magic are reminiscent of the use of the occult as a plot device in films directed by B. Vittalacharya.|$|E
5|$|Gandavyuha is {{the story}} told in the final chapter of the Avatamsaka Sutra about Sudhana's tireless {{wandering}} {{in search of the}} Highest Perfect Wisdom. It covers two galleries (third and fourth) and also half of the second gallery, comprising in total of 460 panels. The principal figure of the story, the youth Sudhana, son of an extremely rich merchant, appears on the 16th panel. The preceding 15 panels form a prologue <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> the miracles during Buddha's samadhi in the Garden of Jeta at Sravasti.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Mansour {{was offered}} {{money for the}} film rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> her life. She {{said that she would}} accept on {{condition}} that the money was enough to balance Michigan's state deficit, $900,000,000 at that time. No film rights were obtained. Mansour remained director of DSS until 1987. Under her leadership, the department's error rate dropped to its lowest levels in awarding food stamps, Medicaid funds, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). She increased the investigation and conviction of fraud cases, and she achieved the highest national record of locating deadbeat parents for collecting child support. She streamlined office procedures, and she initiated programs to curtail teenage pregnancy and to assist teenage mothers. She broadened the state program benefiting victims of domestic abuse.|$|E

5|$|Iron Arm, Golden Sabre {{was written}} by Wang Yun Heng and Xiao Yun Long and {{published}} in 1986. This novel, which serves as Zhou's own fictional biography, is a prequel <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Story</b> <b>of</b> Yue Fei because it details his adventures decades prior to taking Yue Fei as his student. It follows {{his life as a}} young martial arts instructor in the Song army's Imperial guard, his struggles against the Xixia and Liao Tartar barbarian tribes and his tutelage of Water Margin outlaws. The last few chapters incorporate the storyline from the four chapters that he appears in The Story of Yue Fei. This was later adapted into a ten volume Lianhuanhua-style comic book called The Legend of Zhou Tong in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Madsen's {{idea was}} to bring {{attention}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> Flammen and Citron as he felt it had been neglected or misrepresented. The most expensive Danish film produced to that date, it was co-produced by German companies because initially there was no interest in producing the film in Denmark. Portraying the protagonists as morally ambiguous characters, the director tried to depict war as a complicated experience that goes beyond a good versus evil dichotomy. With visual and narrative references borrowed from film noir and the French film Army of Shadows, Flame & Citron also explores themes of love, betrayal, and the emotional aspects of relationships.|$|E
5|$|Penman's {{characterization}} of Simon de Montfort {{is that of}} a man increasingly disillusioned by his sovereign, who rebels in 1263, becomes regent to Henry III, and attempts to reestablish rights granted under the Magna Carta. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> Simon de Montfort and his wife, Eleanor the Countess of Pembroke and sister to King Henry III, the novel presents characters such as the Welsh ruler Llywelyn Fawr and London's FitzThomas.|$|E

40|$|Narrative and {{storytelling}} play {{an important}} part in knowledge management in policing and criminal justice contexts.

5|$|The {{octagonal}} font {{dates from}} the 15th century; its carved panels alternate images of the symbols of the Four Evangelists with seated figures of the Doctors of the Church (Saint Ambrose, Saint Augustine, Saint Jerome, and Pope Gregory I). The central column carries shields depicting the Instruments of the Passion and the Holy Wounds. The eastern shield is unusual in that a sword is shown with an ear stuck to it. This refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> Saint Peter striking off the ear of Malchus, the High Priest's servant, {{in the garden of}} Gethsemane.|$|E
5|$|According to Hindu mythology, {{the lands}} of Kerala were {{recovered}} from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram ("The Land of Parasurama")). Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded {{as far as it}} reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari. The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. The legend was later expanded, and found literary expression in the 17th or 18th century with Keralolpathi, which traces the origin of aspects of early Kerala society, such as land tenure and administration, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> Parasurama. In medieval times Kuttuvan may have emulated the Parasurama tradition by throwing his spear into the sea to symbolise his lordship over it.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact ancient burial mounds (a part of the necropolis of antic Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results {{are not at all}} clear, and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield. If Zibold's condenser worked at all, this was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it could never have produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.|$|E
25|$|Another obvious {{reference}} is <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> One Thousand and One Nights. Haroun, {{the son of}} Rashid Khalifa refers to Harun al-Rashid, a caliph who ruled from 786 to 809 and who features frequently in Thousand and One Nights stories.|$|R

5|$|In the 2015 {{video game}} , {{which is the}} sequel to Batman: Arkham City, while under the {{influence}} of Scarecrow's latest toxin, Batman hallucinates the Joker's shooting of Barbara Gordon after she is kidnapped by the mysterious Arkham Knight, a hallucination of Joker noting that he merely got lucky when he shot Barbara as he was ignorant of her true ties to Batman, and also claimed that he had actually been aiming for Barbara's head. In addition, the DLC side story Batgirl: A Matter of Family had various similarities <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> The Killing Joke, including Joker kidnapping and holding Police Commissioner Gordon hostage at a run-down amusement park as well as the backstory revealing that Joker had conned and murdered the original person who owned the park into granting him control.|$|E
5|$|The other {{significant}} theory {{about the origin}} of the legend, proposed by Robert Chambers in 1864, is that a genuine child was born in the early 17th century with facial deformities resembling a pig's face and a speech impediment causing her to grunt. The science of teratology (the study of birth defects and physiological abnormalities) was then in its infancy, and the theory of maternal impression (that the thoughts of a pregnant woman could influence the future appearance of her children) was widely accepted. It is possible that the birth of a genuinely deformed child led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> the beggar as a possible explanation for her appearance, with other elements of the story being later additions or distortions by publishers. Chambers speculates that the original child may have had a similar appearance to Julia Pastrana, a woman with hypertrichosis and distorted (although not pig-like) facial features, who was widely exhibited in Europe and North America until her death in 1860, and then, embalmed, until the 1970s. However, while a 1952 stillbirth with a face resembling a pig is documented, {{there has never been a}} reliably documented case of a human with deformities of this kind surviving outside the womb, while all versions of the pig-faced woman legend describe her as a healthy adult.|$|E
5|$|Zhou has {{appeared}} in various forms of media such as novels, comic books, and movies. His rare 20th century biography, Iron Arm, Golden Sabre, serves as a sequel <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Story</b> <b>of</b> Yue Fei because it details his adventures decades prior to taking Yue as his pupil. This was later adapted into a ten volume Lianhuanhua comic book. He also appears in a novel concerning one of his fictional martial arts brothers. He was portrayed by three different actors {{in a string of}} black and white Yue Fei films produced in the 1940s and 1960s, one of which featured a ten-year-old Sammo Hung as the lead. Veteran martial arts actor Yu Chenghui, who played the sword-wielding antagonist in Jet Li's Shaolin Temple, stated in a 2005 interview that he has always wanted to portray Zhou in a film.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the game}} started in May 2012, shortly {{after the release of}} XIII-2s final piece of DLC, and was {{unveiled}} at a special 25th Anniversary Event for the Final Fantasy series in September that year. Most of the previous games' key creative minds and developers returned, and it was developed by Square Enix's First Production Department, with developer tri-Ace helping with the graphics. The development team wanted the game to bring a conclusive end <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> both Lightning and the XIII universe, and to address criticisms leveled against the last two games. During its first week on sale in Japan, it sold 277,000 units, {{and by the end of}} 2013 become the 17th best-selling game of the year selling over 400,000 copies. It has sold 800,000 copies as of May 2014. In September 2014, Square Enix announced the Final Fantasy XIII series has been widely successful and has shipped over 11 million copies worldwide. The Microsoft Windows version has sold over 300,000 copies according to SteamSpy. It has received mixed reviews: while the main praise went to the game's battle system, opinions were more mixed for the graphics, time limit and other aspects of gameplay, while the story and characters were criticized for being weak or poorly developed. Final Fantasy series brand manager Shinji Hashimoto revealed in October 2016 that Lightning Returns met sales expectations and that Square Enix is satisfied with it.|$|E
