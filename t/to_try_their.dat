5|$|In {{the early}} days of sound cinema, among the various {{distinguished}} composers ready <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>their</b> hand at film music, Prokofiev was not an obvious choice for the commission. Based in Paris for almost a decade, he had a reputation for experimentation and dissonance, characteristics at odds with the cultural norms of the Soviet Union. By early 1933, however, Prokofiev was anxious to return to his homeland, and saw the film commission as an opportunity to write music in a more popular and accessible style.|$|E

25|$|The data {{communications}} products Bynet distributed in Israel {{in the later}} half of the 1970s were all manufactured abroad. Though today Israel hosts more companies traded on NASDAQ {{than any other country}} apart from the United States and China, at that juncture in its history, Israel’s exports were disproportionately agricultural. The country had no home-grown, export-oriented hi-tech telecommunications industry. Undeterred by the fact that no venture capital was then available in the country, the Zisapel brothers decided <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>their</b> luck by establishing an export-oriented company in Israel to manufacture the types of devices that Bynet had been distributing.|$|E

For the 1976 season, British Leyland contracted James Broad and his tuning and engineering outfit, Broadspeed Engineering, a firm which had seen previous success racing Minis and Ford Capris around Europe.

25|$|Jimmy Eat World {{formed in}} Mesa, Arizona in 1993.

The band {{originally}} formed with a punk rock sound and first released a demo tape in 1993, followed by their first EP in 1994, entitled One, Two, Three, Four.

25|$|Woodland's origins trace back to 1850 when California gained its {{statehood}} and Yolo County was established. Since {{the town}} started growing in population and resources, {{it has not}} stopped. The area was well irrigated due {{to the efforts of}} James Moore, and this drew people out <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>their</b> hand at farming. The endeavor was successful as people found the soil in the area very fertile. The city gained a federal post office and the next year the county seat was moved from Washington (present day West Sacramento, California) to Woodland after Washington was flooded. The addition of a railroad line, the close proximity to Sacramento, and the more recent addition of Interstate 5, helped create a thriving city.|$|E
25|$|The filly {{was never}} entered {{for any of}} the British Classic Races but proved herself the best of her {{generation}} by beating the winners of both The Derby and The Oaks in the space of three days at Newmarket in October 1831. In the following year she won the Ascot Gold Cup, the year's most important weight-for-age race in a run-off after being held to a dead heat by the St Leger winner Rowton. From the summer of 1832, few owners were willing <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>their</b> horses against her and she won several prizes by walkover or forfeit. She was retired from racing after sustaining an injury in the spring of 1834. She made little impact as a broodmare and died in 1841.|$|E
25|$|While at Greenville, Thompson met Elizabeth Mahon, {{a talented}} {{player with the}} same passion for baseball, with whom she started a close friendship. Eventually, Thompson played in Greenville {{on the same team}} with Mahon. By then, a talent scout offered Thompson and Mahon an {{invitation}} to come to the newly formed AAGPBL tryouts, which were to be held at Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois. With the prospect of making the $60 per week that was being paid {{to the members of the}} established teams, which was a vast sum of money then, the two Greenville girls decided <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>their</b> hand in the new circuit, obtaining full-time jobs in the AAGPBL for the 1944 season. Thompson was assigned to the Milwaukee Chicks, while Mahon joined the Minneapolis Millerettes, becoming the only South Carolina ballplayers in AAGPBL history. Mahon died in 2001 at the age of 82.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day, Chen narrowly won {{the election}} with a margin of less than 30,000 votes out of 12.9million votes counted. Both of his referendum proposals were rejected due to insufficient turnout, {{in part by the}} Pan-Blue boycott. Those that did vote for the referendum overwhelmingly favored it. Due to the activation of the so-called National Security Mechanism which prevented military officers from voting, and island-wide reports of election fraud, Pan-Blue candidate Lien Chan refused to concede and sued both for a recount and for a nullification of the outcome while supporters held a week-long protest led by the Pan-Blues front of the presidential office in Taipei. He also claimed that the shooting was staged by Chen to win sympathy votes. Chen claimed that the shooting could not have been staged, because it would be too dangerous to have himself shot in a moving jeep and also challenged Lien and vice-presidential candidate James Soong <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>their</b> luck with a shooter in a stationary jeep. This challenge was {{based on the assumption that}} his belly wound was inflicted while he was in the moving jeep and not before or afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Result: Odyssey {{got off to}} {{a strong}} start, as team leader Patrick had a lot of {{experience}} in the fashion industry. However, as {{he was the only one}} on his team to know anything about it, he had to spend a lot of time telling the others what could sell, which left less time for him to lead the team. Patrick also designed a kimono/wetsuit, which drew customers to the stall, but failed to sell. Halfway through the day, Patrick made the decision to leave the shopping centre they were selling at <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>their</b> luck selling to retailers. They had little success doing this however, and had to resort to selling all their customized stock to one retailer for £40, losing nearly £100 on the cost of creating them. On the girls' team, Ashleigh led from the front and made firm decisions, but the clothes they chose did not sell as well as on the boys' team. Nonetheless, the sub-team at the shopping centre managed to attract many customers, and eventually the team made a profit of £453.36, while Odyssey made a profit of £330.37.|$|E
25|$|Five {{days after}} the wedding, Jim {{received}} his draft notice. He was sent to France and became part of a military touring group that entertained the armed forces after World War I. When Jim came home from France, he and Marian decided <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>their</b> luck with a vaudeville act. They had two children, Kathryn Therese Jordan (1920–2007) and James Carroll Jordan (1923–1998), both born in Peoria. Marian returned home {{for the birth of}} Kathryn but went back to performing with Jim, leaving her daughter with Jim's parents. After Jim Jr. was born in 1923, Marian stayed with the children for a time, while Jim performed as a solo act. Marian and the children joined him on the road for a short time, but the couple had to admit defeat when they found themselves in Lincoln, Illinois in 1923 with two small children and no funds. The couple's parents had to wire them money for their return to Peoria. Jim went to work at a local department store but still felt the attraction of being in show business. He and Marian went back into vaudeville.|$|E

25|$|For this {{challenge}} teams were altered due to blue now having 4 members and red being left with 2 after Jason's departure. Ivan and Katie chose Fenton {{to join their}} team and even the stakes. Next the teams were taken to a sausage kitchen. They then made their own sausage meat and ground it up into one long sausage {{that had to be}} rolled into normal sized sausages. Ivan was quite adapt at creating objects out of balloons so he was named the 'balloon man' for the challenge and helped the red team make over 400 sausages and win the round. New red team member Fenton was given the nickname 'bacon' as he had the reputation of 'bringing home the bacon.' The next part to the challenge was to construct a BBQ straight out of a flat-pack box. The blue team came out on top this time. Once assembled, the two teams then had to cook the sausages they had made for children (and their parents) from the local athletics club, who were now cheering the teams on. Each sausage had to be served with a different condiment. Then as part of the presenting aspect of the show, the teams were each given a megaphone which they used to try to persuade the kids <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>their</b> sausages over the other teams. It seemed like an out of control bidding war and while Katie and Bill did well at the task, Fenton didn't even need a microphone. In the end the judges differed in their opinions of who won. Ben believed the red team made the better sausage sizzle while Mark thought blue had it in the bag. Blue were selected as the winners and two from the red team were sent home.|$|E
500|$|Masereel's {{commercial}} success led other artists <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>their</b> {{hands at the}} genre; themes of oppression under capitalism were prominent, a pattern set early by Masereel. At age thirteen, Polish-French artist Balthus drew a wordless story about his cat; {{it was published in}} 1921 with an introduction by poet Rainer Maria Rilke. [...] In Destiny (1926), Otto Nückel (1888–1955) produced a work with greater nuance and atmosphere than Masereel's bombastic works; where Masereel told tales of Man's struggle against Society, Nückel told of the life of an individual woman. [...] Destiny appeared in a US edition in 1930 and sold well there.|$|E

One of the tracks rehearsed at this time (although not included on the LP) was called [...] "The Juicy Fruit Song". It included elements of the future [...] "Take On Me", including {{an early version of}} the central riff. Soon after, Bridges disbanded.
