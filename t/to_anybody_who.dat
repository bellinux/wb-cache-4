5|$|The Screaming Skulls opening {{disclaimer}} that a free burial {{would be}} provided <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> died of fright {{while watching the}} film {{was inspired by a}} gimmick that had been used by William Castle in his film Macabre (1958), in which he offered every viewer who bought a ticket life insurance in case they died watching the film. Unlike Castle, Nicol did not actually contact an insurance company.|$|E

25|$|A hundred police {{officers}} were present throughout Chen's press conference on 21 February, and some citizens complained about the waste of manpower. The police emphasised the importance of maintaining public order {{in light of the}} great public and media interest in the case. The triads reportedly offered a HK$500,000 reward <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> hacked off Chen's hand. This contributed to fears for Chen's safety upon his return, and heavy police protection.|$|E

25|$|In 1911 the Theosophical Society {{established}} the Order of the Star in the East (OSE) {{to prepare the}} world for the expected appearance of the World Teacher. Krishnamurti was named as its head, with senior Theosophists assigned various other positions. Membership was open <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> accepted the doctrine of the Coming of the World Teacher. Controversy soon erupted, both within the Theosophical Society and outside it, in Hindu circles and the Indian press.|$|E
25|$|Conservative and Reform Judaism do not {{generally}} require women to wear head coverings. Some more traditional Conservative synagogues may ask that married women cover their heads during services. However, some more liberal Conservative synagogues suggest that women, married or not, wear head-coverings {{similar to those}} worn by men, and some require it (or require it only for women receiving honors or leading services from the bimah), not for modesty, but as a feminist gesture of egalitarianism. Almost all Conservative synagogues require men to wear a head covering (usually a kippah), but in Reform synagogues, there is often no requirement. However, kippot may be provided <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> wishes to wear them.|$|E
25|$|In aid of Soviet {{preparations}} for its commitments to the International Geophysical Year on 29 August 1955 {{and in the}} absence of diplomatic relations, Australia sent the Soviets a note, via the British Embassy in Moscow, offering facilities in Australia for the use of the Soviets in the instance they were required. Australia wanted to keep the Soviets out of the Antarctic but wanted to avoid international condemnation for going against the spirit of the IGY. The Australians also used the note as a ruse, albeit an unsuccessful one, to force the Soviets to recognise the Australian Antarctic Territory and hence, Australian claims over parts of the Antarctic. The Lena arrived in Port Adelaide on 28 March 1956 after its journey to the Antarctic. The Soviets gave free public access to the ship during its stay, and among the first people to visit the ship and meet with the crew was Douglas Mawson. Australian naval intelligence exploited the situation and sent two civilian agents on board the ship while it was open to the public. It is unknown what information they would have obtained as the scientists on the ship openly shared their knowledge and demonstrated equipment <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> was interested, and allowed the public to wander around without obstruction. The Ob arrived in Adelaide on 21 April 1956 and was also visited by Mawson and others within the scientific community in Adelaide. The Ob was invited by the Australia–USSR Friendship Society and the Building Workers' Industrial Union to visit Melbourne and Sydney, respectively, and Mawson lobbied to have the visits go ahead, but permission was denied by Minister of External Affairs Richard Casey. The decision was criticised by Mawson, and he made note of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation losing an opportunity to view the latest oceanographic research technology.|$|E

500|$|A report {{published}} in the American magazine Time a fortnight later described the incident as [...] "a genuine horror story, calculated {{to make the most}} alarming of Rhodesian doomsday prophecies seem true." [...] The white community in Rhodesia heard the news with fury, and many turned their minds to exacting retribution for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism. The prominent Indian-Rhodesian Gulab family was particularly affected by the incident, having lost eight members in the attack. Though Rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash, doing so only after four days' investigation, the truth was common knowledge in Salisbury within hours. Smith wrote in his memoirs that the [...] "degree of anger... difficult to control". White South Africans were similarly enraged, particularly after reports appeared in the South African press that the killers had raped the female passengers before massacring them. A Friends of Rhodesia Society in South Africa offered a reward of R100,000 <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> would either kill Nkomo or bring him to Salisbury to stand trial.|$|E

2500|$|By the mid-1970s, Ronstadt's image became just {{as famous}} as her music. In 1976 and 1977, she {{appeared}} {{on the covers of}} Rolling Stone and Time, respectively. The Rolling Stone cover story was accompanied by a series of photographs of Ronstadt in a skimpy red slip, taken by Annie Leibovitz. Ronstadt felt deceived by the photographer, not realizing that the photos would be so revealing. She says her manager Peter Asher kicked Leibovitz out of the house when she visited to show them the photographs prior to publication. Leibovitz had refused to let them veto any of the photos, which included one of Ronstadt sprawled across a bed in her underpants. In a 1977 interview, Ronstadt explained, [...] "Annie [...] saw that picture as an expose of my personality. She was right.

Later that night, Triple H defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Goldberg, to whom he lost the title. On the September 29 episode of Raw, Triple H issued a $100,000 bounty <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> could take out Goldberg. Three weeks later, Batista made his return during a match between Goldberg and Michaels and attacked the champion, finishing by stomping on a steel chair with Goldberg's ankle sandwiched in it to claim the bounty. At Survivor Series, Orton participated in a Team Bischoff versus Team Austin elimination tag team match in which Orton was the sole survivor. Later that night, Goldberg faced Triple H in a rematch from Unforgiven for the World Heavyweight Championship which Goldberg won despite repeated interference from Flair, Orton, and Batista.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{surround}} the government forces, Hirotsugu split his army into three units; one {{under his command}} and the others under command of his subordinates, Tsunade and Komaro respectively. Together they advanced along different routes to northern Kyushu where the Kanmon Straits separate Kyushu from Japan's main island, Honshu. Along the way, on 19 October, Hirotsugu stopped {{at the headquarters of}} Oka district to [...] "make camp, set up his crossbows, raise beacon signals, and conscript soldiers from the province [...] ". Eventually he arrived at fortifications (chinsho) in Miyako district, Buzen Province near the expected invasion route. But Hirotsugu's plans for an organized attack were foiled as one army of several thousand men did not appear and another unit was late. The government army successfully landed on Kyushu, captured men and weapons from three camps at Tomi, Itabitsu and Miyako in Buzen Province. Earlier the court's army had been reinforced on 16/17 October with more than 4,000 men including 40 fine soldiers (jōhei) under the magistrate of Toyoura District, Nagato Province. On 20 October, several of Hirotsugu's allies surrendered and changed sides: four district officials defected together with 500 mounted warriors and a citizen from Buzen Province killed one of the rebels. Later, a magistrate from a Buzen district returned with several rebels' heads from battle. On 24 October, an imperial decree was distributed among the population and officials of Kyushu, trying to discredit Hirotsugu, and promising rewards <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> killed Hirotsugu.|$|E
