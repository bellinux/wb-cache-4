5|$|At {{the time}} of Riedel AGs bankruptcy, three prototypes of an Imme with a 150cc {{parallel}} twin <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine</b> had been made. Fritz Philipps, {{who had been a}} senior executive at Riedel AG, formed Zweirad-Motoren und -Getriebe GmbH (ZMG) to supply parts and perform repairs on Imme motorcycles. ZMG also set up to manufacture an Imme with a 175cc straight-twin <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine,</b> but made only 25 before they ended production.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Roberts {{stunned the}} racing world {{when he left}} Yamaha after more than 25 years {{to start his own}} {{motorcycle}} company. Roberts had grown weary of battling over the direction he felt the Yamaha team needed to pursue. Basing his new company in England {{to take advantage of the}} Formula 1 industry, Roberts built a three-cylinder, <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine</b> with the engineering assistance of Tom Walkinshaw Racing. He decided to take advantage of rules allowing lighter weights for three-cylinder motorcycles after observing the agility and handling advantage of Spencer's Honda NS500 during the 1983 season. Unfortunately, by the time the motorcycle had been developed, tire technology had improved to the point where any advantage over four-cylinder bikes had been negated. The motorcycle did manage to win a pole position with rider Jeremy McWilliams taking the top qualifying position at the 2002 Australian Grand Prix against the new breed of 990cc four-stroke MotoGP motorcycles.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> {{have fewer}} moving parts than {{four-stroke}} engines, and produce {{twice the number}} of power strokes per revolution; consequently, <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> are more powerful for their mass. Two-strokes offer stronger acceleration, but similar top speed compared to a four-stroke <b>engine.</b> [...] <b>Two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> have shorter life due to poorer piston lubrication, since lubrication comes from the fuel-oil mix.|$|R
50|$|Simple <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> with ported inlet and exhaust {{cannot be}} {{supercharged}} since the inlet port always closes first. For this reason, <b>two-stroke</b> Diesel <b>engines</b> usually have mechanical exhaust valves with separate timing to allow supercharging. Regardless of this, <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> require scavenging at all engine speeds and so turbocharged <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> must still employ a blower, usually Roots type. This blower may be mechanically or electrically driven, {{in either case}} the blower may be disengaged once the turbocharger starts to deliver air.|$|R
50|$|The <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> on rickshaws and {{motorcycles}} {{are one of}} {{the major}} polluters of air in Karachi and the rest of Pakistan. The <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> as well as defective or unturned vehicles are major polluters with carbon dioxide emissions. <b>Two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> as well as defective vehicles using substandard lubricant are major emitters of sulfur dioxide and smoke. Automobiles operating on compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas are major air polluters.|$|R

25|$|The Shadow first flew in 1983, {{powered by}} a 53hp (40kW) Fuji EC44 Robin <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine.</b> This was later {{replaced}} by a 40hp (30kW) Rotax 447 air-cooled <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine</b> for the initial B series of Shadows. Several different Rotax engines {{have been used in}} the subsequent C, D and E series and the Streak and Star Streak developments. Production began in 1984.|$|E
25|$|Limited {{production}} of the version flown to Oshkosh started {{in the fall of}} 1979. The model was called the Pterodactyl Pfledge OR (Oshkosh Replica) and was powered by a Sachs SA-340 336cc direct drive <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like Vespas of the day, Lambrettas {{had three}} or four gears and <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> with {{capacities}} ranging from 49 cc to 198 cc. Most <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> require a mixture of oil with the gasoline in order to lubricate the piston and cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|In some <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines,</b> a Helmholtz {{resonator}} is used {{to remove}} {{the need for a}} reed valve.

50|$|In 2002, the F.I.M. {{changed the}} {{displacement}} formulas {{to reflect the}} changes in engine technology and as a move towards environmentally friendlier four-stroke engines. The new MX1 class became the premier class, allowing <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> of up to 250cc and four-stroke engines of up to 450cc. The MX2 class allowed <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> of up to 125cc and four-stroke motors of up to 250cc. The MX3 class allowed <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> of up to 500cc and four stroke engines of up to 650cc.|$|R

25|$|Manual hole {{drilling}} and spike or screw insertion and removal {{have been replaced}} by semi-automated or automated machines, which are driven electrically, by pneumatics, by hydraulics, or are powered by a <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine.</b> Machines that remove spikes are called spike pullers.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine</b> {{that uses}} a camshaft, each valve is opened once for every {{rotation}} of the crankshaft; in these engines, the camshaft rotates {{at the same speed}} as the crankshaft. In a four-stroke engine, the valves are opened only half as often; thus, two full rotations of the crankshaft occur for each rotation of the camshaft.|$|E
50|$|A {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} PC50 {{is the use of}} a four-stroke engine, at a time almost all pedal-equipped mopeds used <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines.</b> Honda's early development of 50 cc four-stroke engines was a result of Soichiro Honda's dislike of the sharp noise of <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> {{often have}} a high power-to-weight ratio, power being {{available}} in a narrow range of rotational speeds called the [...] "power band". Compared to four-stroke <b>engines,</b> <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> have a greatly reduced number of moving parts, and so can be more compact and significantly lighter.|$|R

25|$|The {{first of}} the Trabants left the VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau factory in Saxony on 7 November 1957. It was a {{relatively}} advanced car when it was formally introduced the following year, with front wheel drive, unitary construction and independent suspension. The Trabant's greatest shortcoming was its engine. By the late 1950s many small Western cars (such as the Renault) had cleaner, more-efficient four-stroke engines, but budgetary constraints and raw-materials shortages mandated an outdated (but inexpensive) <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine</b> in the Trabant. It was technically equivalent to the West German Lloyd automobile, a similarly sized car with an air-cooled, two-cylinder four-stroke engine. The Trabant had a front, transversely-mounted engine and front-wheel drive {{in an era when}} many European cars were using rear-mounted engines or front-mounted engines with rear-wheel drive. Its greatest drawback was its largely unchanged production; the car's <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine</b> made it obsolete by the 1970s, limiting exports to Western Europe.|$|E
25|$|The moped {{used to be}} {{a hybrid}} of the bicycle and the motorcycle, {{equipped}} with a small engine (usually a small <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine</b> up to 50cc, but occasionally an electric motor) and a bicycle drivetrain, and motive power can be supplied by the engine, the rider, or both. There is also Sport mopeds – a type of moped that resembles a sport bike.|$|E
25|$|The Rex (K21), {{introduced}} 15 July 1972, was {{the replacement}} for the Subaru R-2, which was itself the {{replacement for the}} long lived, but outdated Subaru 360. Because the R-2 was based largely on the 360, originally including its air-cooled <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine,</b> it lasted for not even three years. In contrast, the 360 was produced for 11 years and the rear-engined Rex was produced for nine.|$|E

25|$|A {{leaf blower}} is a {{gardening}} tool that propels {{air out of}} a nozzle to move yard debris such as leaves. Leaf blowers are usually powered by <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine</b> or an electric motor, but four-stroke engines were recently introduced to partially address air pollution concerns. Leaf blowers are typically self-contained handheld units, or backpack mounted units with a handheld wand. The leaf blower was invented by Dom Quinto in 1950.|$|E
25|$|A {{licensed}} {{version of}} the Volkswagen Polo engine replaced the Trabant's <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine</b> in 1989, {{the result of a}} trade agreement between East and West Germany. The model, the Trabant 1.1, also had minor improvements to its brake and signal lights, a renovated grille, and MacPherson struts instead of a leaf-spring-suspended chassis. When the 1.1 began production in May 1990, the two German states had already agreed to reunification.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Electro-Motive Diesel's {{two-stroke}} engines, the mechanically assisted turbocharger is not specifically a twincharger, as the engine uses the mechanical assistance to charge air only at lower engine speeds and startup. Once above notch # 5, the engine uses true turbocharging. This differs from a turbocharger that uses the compressor section of the turbo-compressor only during starting and, as a two-stroke engines cannot naturally aspirate, and, according to SAE definitions, a <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine</b> with a mechanically assisted compressor during idle and low throttle is considered naturally aspirated.|$|E
50|$|Four-stroke engines, as {{for almost}} all cars, and large <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> used in {{locomotives}} and ships can both use either wet or dry sumps. Large <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines</b> do not use crankcase compression; instead they use a separate blower or supercharger, either a mechanical blower such as a Roots blower or else a turbocharger.|$|R
50|$|Loop {{scavenging}} is {{the most}} common type of fuel/air mixture transfer used on modern <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines.</b> Suzuki was one of the first manufacturers outside of Europe to adopt loop-scavenged <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engines.</b> This operational feature was used in conjunction with the expansion chamber exhaust developed by German motorcycle manufacturer, MZ and Walter Kaaden.|$|R

25|$|Auvinen {{then began}} pouring <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine</b> fuel (a {{gasoline}} and oil mixture) on corridor walls and floors, {{but he was}} not able to ignite the fuel. He then went to the school canteen on the first floor and tried to enter it, but the sliding glass doors were locked. After demanding to be let in, he fired through the glass, hitting some chairs inside. People hiding in the canteen were able to escape through the other end of the room and hid in the rooms behind the kitchen. No one was hit in the canteen.|$|E
25|$|Suzuki was {{the first}} company to offer a kei car in 1955. One {{interesting}} departure from other Kei cars was the Fronte Coupé introduced in September 1971. It was a 2+2 (or a strict 2-seater) Giugiaro-designed mini GT based on the rear-engine Suzuki Fronte, measuring a mere 2,995mm. It used a 359cc <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine</b> developing 31, 34 or 37hp (35 in later models) depending on equipment level. The Fronte Coupé was discontinued in June, 1976, as it didn't suit the new Kei Jidosha limits, nor the stricter emissions regulations.|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} in Motor Cycle {{magazine}} in 1914, Alfred Scott wrote that {{he was drawn to}} the <b>two-stroke</b> <b>engine</b> because he was trained on high speed steam and marine engines, and when turning his attention to gas and petrol engines the regular power strokes of the two-stroke (or Day cycle as he sometimes called it), seemed preferable to the one power stroke in four of the Otto cycle. He said this attraction to the two stroke was further enhanced by the reliable and excellent service from a two stroke engine designed by his brother (A. F. Scott M.I.M.E) and used to drive machinery in his experimental workshop.|$|E
