5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{institute}} {{take their}} name primarily from Master Morya, a non-corporeal spiritual leader from whom Helena Roerich received guidance via automatic writing.

Critics also enjoyed the further revelations about Olivia's background; the subject would later have an entire episode devoted {{to it in the}} third season.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{dropped the}} word streek (regional) from its name and now calls itself Museum de Oude Wolden (Museum the Old Wolds). Since the {{renovation}} in 2012, the historical objects and the artworks by De Ploeg {{are no longer}} on permanent display, the museum now focuses on art, region, and history with Bruckman's paintings and temporary exhibitions. In 2017, the museum became an independent foundation, although the municipality of Bellingwedde still owns <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> collection.|$|E

5|$|After {{the school}} closed in 1953, the larger, {{original}} room was {{converted into a}} bus garage by the Chana School District. A large garage door was cut into <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> floor completely removed. The smaller, 1893 room became a storage area. In 1962, the Chana School District ran out of room and used the building as an overflow classroom. By the mid-1960s, the Chana District folded and was absorbed by the Oregon School District. Residents were allowed to remove any items from the school after the district shut down.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} {{building}} had not officially opened, Comcast office workers began moving in early December 2007, ahead of the scheduled completion in March 2008. The Comcast Center officially opened on June 6, 2008. A study sponsored by Comcast and Liberty Property Trust said {{the construction of the}} Comcast Center created 17,200 jobs and generated US$2 billion of economic activity for Pennsylvania. Despite opposition by other building owners to construction of the Comcast Center, by the time most space in the Comcast Center had been leased vacancy rates in Center City offices were falling and rents were rising. Even HRPT Properties Trust had leased 70 percent of the space Comcast vacated by 2007. The predictions by opponents did not occur mainly because Comcast ended up leasing 89 percent of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> offices for the Comcast Center's second largest tenant, Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, were new to the city.|$|E
5|$|Following from draft {{plans in}} August 2016, a new {{planning}} application was submitted by Interesting Developments on 16 January 2017 {{to convert the}} pub back into a house as it appeared around 1900, demolishing the 20th century extensions and modifications and restoring historic features such as the interior fireplaces and the oculus window, A separate part to the planning application included three two-storey two-bedroom terraced houses to be constructed on the pub garden, along with a redesigned and landscaped car park to include a charging station. An additional house {{to the rear of}} the pub was considered but not proposed; campaigners criticised the absence of plans to preserve some historic features, the partial demolition of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> proximity of the new buildings. Despite objections, planning permission was granted by Medway Council on 13 June 2017.|$|E

5|$|Helen Magnus awakens in a {{dilapidated}} corridor in the Sanctuary and finds that both <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surrounding city skyline lie in ruins; Magnus has no memory {{on how the}} devastation occurred. While venturing the streets, Magnus finds herself under attack by a savage humanoid creature, but is saved by two men in Hazmat suits, who proceed to capture and decontaminate her. Magnus is later shocked to discover that her protégé, Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne), {{is the leader of}} the survivalist group. Unlike his original personality, Zimmerman is acting far more violent and aggressive, and believes Magnus to be an imposter, citing she died three years ago. As more creatures attack the base, Magnus escapes and returns to the Sanctuary, where on the way she is joined by a young girl, Jessica Mitchell (Nicole Muñoz).|$|E
5|$|Inside, Rory {{finds himself}} drawn to an {{apartment}} with his name on it. Just as the Doctor and the others arrive, Rory finds an elderly version of himself in the bedroom. The Doctor warns that Rory's fate is now sealed—he will die in that room, without having seen Amy {{for a very long}} time beforehand. He deduces that the Angels have been using the Quay as a battery farm, sending the victims to their past while feeding off their time energy. Rory and Amy refuse to accept their fate, and as the Angels converge, they flee to the roof, where the Statue of Liberty, revealed to be a Weeping Angel, waits for them. Rory surmises that if he kills himself by jumping off the roof, he'll create a paradox that will destroy <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Angels, resetting the future. Refusing to allow him to die alone, Amy joins him and the two jump off the roof.|$|E

The palace, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his sister, now houses the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Olga and Peter had {{separate}} bedrooms {{at opposite ends of}} <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Grand Duchess had her own art studio. Unhappy in her marriage, she fell into bouts of depression that caused her to lose her hair, forcing her to wear a wig. It took two years for her hair to regrow.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} Master Apartments' opening, <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{institute}} both experienced monetary deficits, {{with the building}} going into foreclosure in 1932. Two years later, Horch had his tax-exempt corporation, Master Institute of United Arts, Inc., become the building's landlord, with receivership ending the next year in 1935. Soon after, the Horch and Roerich families dissolved their partnership due to disagreements, and the Roeriches unsuccessfully sued Horch {{to regain control of}} the Master Apartments. Horch then closed the Roeriches' museum, forcing it to find a new location, and replaced it with the Riverside Museum. Louis Horch's wife Nettie also controlled some aspects of the building and its organizations during this time, but by 1958, the Horches' son Frank became the building's manager.|$|E
5|$|The Actor Rebellion of 1733 was {{an event}} that {{took place at the}} Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London, England when the actors who worked there, disapproving of the changes in the management, {{attempted}} to seize control. Before the rebellion, the theatre was controlled by the managers Theophilus Cibber, John Ellys, and John Highmore. When Theophilus lost his share and was denied a bid to run the theatre, he, along with other actors, attempted to take over the theatre by controlling the lease. When the shareholders found out, they refused to admit the actors to <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> theatre was closed for several months. The fight spilled over to the contemporary newspapers, which generally sided with the managers.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{surrounding}} park {{were used}} for many public purposes throughout the early 20th century. The Tower Building served as headquarters for the United Confederate Veterans Reunion, May 15–18, 1911. Over 106,000 Civil War veterans, the largest popular gathering {{in the history of}} the city up to that time, attended and were housed in the building or camped in the park, which had also become a popular camping area. Later the building served as an armory for the Arkansas National Guard. In 1912, the second floor of the Tower Building became Little Rock's first public library. In 1917, Little Rock built a fire station in the park. A band shell named for H. H. Foster also was built in the park during this time, but no longer exists. In 1936, Works Progress Administration built the Museum of Fine Arts, now called the Arkansas Arts Center, just south of the Tower Building.|$|E
