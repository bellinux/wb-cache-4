5|$|Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia {{are similar}} to B.integrifolia, <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> marked in their differences—the midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> spirally {{arranged}} on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B.integrifolia subspecies. It was these differences that George felt were distinctive enough {{for it to be}} separate it as a full species from B. integrifolia. The overall habit of a Banksia aquilonia tree resembles that of B.integrifolia, though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of B.aquilonia are separated from the northernmost B.integrifolia occurrence by , hence location is helpful in identification.|$|E
5|$|Aspleniummontanum is a small, {{evergreen}} fern which {{grows in}} tufts. <b>The</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> bluish-green and highly divided, proceeding {{from a long}} and often drooping stalk. A.montanum is monomorphic, with no difference in form between sterile and fertile fronds.|$|E
5|$|Grevillea juniperina is pollinated by birds, with bees also {{recorded}} visiting flowers. <b>The</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> food for caterpillars of the cyprotus blue (Candalides cyprotus).

5|$|Most Hippeastrum bulbs are {{tunicate}} (a protective dry {{outer layer}} and fleshy concentric inner scales or leaf bases). The bulbs are generally between 512cm (2"5") {{in diameter and}} produce two to seven long-lasting evergreen or deciduous leaves that are 3090cm (12"36") long and 2.55cm (1"2") wide. <b>The</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> hysteranthous (develop after flowering), sessile, rarely persistent and subpetiolate.|$|E
5|$|Narcissus {{plants have}} one to several basal leaves which are linear, ligulate or strap shaped (long and narrow), {{sometimes}} channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) {{or may not}} (sessile) have a petiole stalk. <b>The</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb. The emerging plant generally has two leaves, but the mature plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a cutin containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour is light green to blue-green. In the mature plant the leaves extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> low hanging. The leaf base is encased in a colourless sheath. After flowering the leaves turn yellow and die back once the seed pod (fruit) is ripe.|$|E
5|$|The buds are {{produced}} in opposite pairs, ovoid (approximately oval in shape) and pointed, with the bud scales (the modified leaves that enclose {{and protect the}} bud) green, edged in dark brown and with dark brown tips, 0.5–1cm (0.2-0.4in). When <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> shed they leave horseshoe shaped marks called leaf scars on the stem.|$|E

5|$|Another source from 684 AD, {{during the}} Tang dynasty and {{recorded}} in Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, states that when <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> taken internally, they make one incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally {{they can be}} effectively used to treat boils, abscesses and itches. Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, catalpa and peach tree to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.|$|E
5000|$|In Indonesia <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> used in <b>the</b> ancient {{culture as}} paper, known as [...] "lontar".

5|$|Hippeastrum {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Spodoptera picta (Crinum grub) as well as Pseudococcidae (Mealybugs), large, and small narcissus bulb flies (Eumerus strigatus and E funeralis), thrips, mites, aphids, snails and slugs. A fungal disease attacking Hippeastrum is Stagonospora curtisii (red blotch, red leaf spot or red fire). <b>The</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> also eaten by grasshoppers, and grasshoppers commonly plant egg pods in the ground near Hippeastrum bulbs, which erupt in the spring, covering the plant with nymphs.|$|E
5|$|Insects, {{including}} beetles, moths, wasps and flies, use the bark, {{leaves and}} flowers {{of the tree}} in various ways. Some feed or hide camouflaged in the skirt of dead leaves, a favourite dry place for weta to hide in winter. Many of the insect companions of C.australis have followed it into the domesticated surroundings of parks and home gardens. If <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> left to decay, the soil underneath cabbage trees becomes a black humus that supports a rich array of amphipods, earthworms and millipedes.|$|E
5|$|Known as baka or baka ni viti in Fiji, Ficus obliqua {{has many}} of its parts used in Fijian {{traditional}} medicine, and was previously held to be sacred there. Its white sap {{has been used for}} painful or swollen joints and limbs or boils, or diluted with water and drunk to improve breast milk. Liquid extracted from the root bark has been used for headaches or, when diluted, to improve health after childbirth, and <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> applied to venereal lesions.

5|$|Two plants {{found near}} Twilight Cove are {{regarded}} as hybrids between A.cuneatus and A.forrestii, the only two Adenanthos species {{to occur in the}} area.

5|$|V. thapsus is a {{dicotyledonous}} {{plant that}} produces a rosette of leaves {{in its first year}} of growth. <b>The</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> large, up to 50cm long. The second-year plants normally produce a single unbranched stem, usually 1–2m tall. In the eastern part of its range in China, it is, however, only reported to grow up to 1.5m tall. The tall, pole-like stems end in a dense spike of flowers that can occupy up to half the stem length. All parts of the plants are covered with star-shaped trichomes. This cover is particularly thick on the leaves, giving them a silvery appearance. The species' chromosome number is 2n=36.|$|E

5|$|A park {{entrance}} fee is charged {{at the four}} access points to the drive. Skyline Drive is a two-lane road that has 75 overlooks providing views of the Shenandoah Valley {{to the west and}} the Piedmont to the east. The drive provides access to numerous trails, including the Appalachian Trail, and it is also used for biking and horseback riding. Skyline Drive is the main road through Shenandoah National Park and has access to campgrounds, visitor centers, and resorts such as Skyland Resort and Big Meadows.

Skyline Drive is designated a National Scenic Byway and a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii usually grows as {{an upright}} bush {{between one and}} three metres (3–10ft) high, {{but it can also}} grow as an openly {{branched}} small tree to six metres (20ft) in sheltered gullies, or as a low, spreading shrub in exposed locations such as the peaks of the Stirling Range. The bark is a grey-brown colour, smooth and thin, with lenticels. <b>The</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> long and thin, from three to ten centimetres (1–5in) long, and five to ten millimetres (–in) wide. Dark green and hairless above but with a hairy white underside, they are easily recognised by their feather-like appearance, caused {{by the fact that they}} are finely divided almost back to the midrib, into as many as 70 thin tapered lobes.|$|E
5|$|On {{flowering}} plants, <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> alternately arranged up the stem. They are {{thick and}} decurrent, with much variation in leaf shape between {{the upper and}} lower leaves on the stem, ranging from oblong to oblanceolate, and reaching sizes up to 50cm long and 14cm across (19inches long and 5inches wide). They become smaller higher up the stem, and less strongly decurrent down the stem. The flowering stem is solid and 2–2.5cm (nearly an inch) across, and occasionally branched just below the inflorescence, usually following damage. After flowering and seed release, the stem and fruits usually persist in winter, drying into dark brown, stiff structures of densely packed, ovoid-shaped, and dry seed capsules. The dried stems may persist into the following spring or even the next summer. The plant produces a shallow taproot.|$|E
