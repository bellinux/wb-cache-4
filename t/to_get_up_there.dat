500|$|Beyoncé names Michael Jackson as her major musical influence. Aged five, Beyoncé {{attended}} {{her first}} ever concert where Jackson performed and she {{claims to have}} realized her purpose. When she presented him with a tribute award at the World Music Awards in 2006, Beyoncé said, [...] "if it wasn't for Michael Jackson, I would never ever have performed." [...] She admires Diana Ross as an [...] "all-around entertainer" [...] and Whitney Houston, who she said [...] "inspired me <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and do what she did." [...] She credits Mariah Carey's singing and her song [...] "Vision of Love" [...] as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child. Her other musical influences include Aaliyah, Prince, Lauryn Hill, Sade Adu, Donna Summer, Mary J. Blige, Janet Jackson, Anita Baker and Rachelle Ferrell.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} artists have {{acknowledged}} Houston as an influence, including Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Toni Braxton, Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera, LeAnn Rimes, Jessica Simpson, Nelly Furtado, Kelly Clarkson, Britney Spears, Ciara, P!nk, Aneeka, Ashanti, Robin Thicke, Jennifer Hudson, Stacie Orrico, Amerie, Destiny's Child, and Ariana Grande. Mariah Carey, who was often compared to Houston, said, [...] "She [...] {{has been a}} big influence on me." [...] She later told USA Today that [...] "none of us would sound the same if Aretha Franklin hadn't ever put out a record, or Whitney Houston hadn't." [...] Celine Dion who was the third member of the troika that dominated female pop singing in the 1990s, did a telephone interview with Good Morning America on February 13, 2012, saying [...] "Whitney's been an amazing inspiration for me. I've been singing with her my whole career, actually. I wanted to have a career like hers, sing like her, look beautiful like her." [...] Beyoncé told the Globe and Mail that Houston [...] "inspired [...] <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and do what [...] did". She also wrote on her website on the day after Houston's death, [...] "I, like every singer, always wanted to be just like [...] Her voice was perfect. Strong but soothing. Soulful and classic. Her vibrato, her cadence, her control. So many of my life's memories are attached to a Whitney Houston song. She is our queen and she opened doors and provided a blueprint for all of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Up there?" [...] say I, {{looking up}} apprehensively, and {{querying}} {{in my mind}} how my estimable friend the mule is ever <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with me on his back.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you think}} you're going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> me <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> you've another guess coming. I'm {{going to wait}} here till they get in, and let them take me. I'm about tired of this foolishness.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{mention the}} alleviations. No, {{you are not}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> yet. <b>There's</b> no place for you to sit in, and the east wind is not greatly mitigated by the sea air. Shall I send Anna to read to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can do {{that and}} welcome," [...] said Jack's father. [...] "But take my advice and take a good lunch along, because {{you may not be}} able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{anything}} <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> I don't know whether there are any farmhouses around or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{a leader}} was <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> like you, with the {{arguments}} I could put into his hands, {{they would make}} the committee discharge that Pingsquit bill of the Gaylords', and pass it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we're {{going to}} Maine {{in just a}} few weeks now, dear." [...] "Yuh--" [...] Then he was pouring it out nakedly, robbed of reticence. [...] "Myra: I think it'd be a good thing for me <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> early." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> to luncheon, and I am in a fix. Mrs. Quest {{will want}} the trap {{to go there}} this afternoon. Can you lend me your dogcart to drive up in? and then perhaps you would not mind if she gave you a lift this afternoon." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were unwilling}} to spare more than four pounds of brown sugar,--unlocking the {{storehouse}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it,--since they only kept a little for such cases as this, and they charged twenty cents a pound for it, which certainly it was worth <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it <b>up</b> <b>there.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word, this is cool enough, in a man's own house!" [...] said Barry. [...] "Well, {{you don't}} expect me <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> while you're <b>there,</b> I suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Will {{you take}} it as it is?” asked Cyprian; “it will {{be a matter of}} a few minutes <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it wrapped <b>up,</b> <b>there</b> is such a crush.” ...|$|R
6000|$|The Saddler. [...] "Mr. Chairman, we've got ONE clean man left, anyway, out of {{the late}} aristocracy; and he needs money, and deserves it. I move that you appoint Jack Halliday <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and auction off that sack of gilt twenty-dollar pieces, and give the result to the right man--the man whom Hadleyburg delights to honour--Edward Richards." ...|$|E
60|$|Whitefoot {{climbed up}} to the old nest of Melody the Wood Thrush {{over the edge of}} which little Mrs. Whitefoot was looking down at him. It took Whitefoot hardly a moment <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> for the nest was only a few feet above the ground in a young tree, and you know Whitefoot is a very good climber.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, Mr. Choate is descended from those Puritans who {{landed on a}} bitter night in December. Every year those people used to meet at a great banquet in New York, and those masters of mind in oratory had to make speeches. It was Doctor Depew's {{business}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and apologise for the Dutch, and Mr. Choate {{had to get up}} later and explain the crimes of the Puritans, and grand, beautiful times we used to have.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hasn't it been a {{delightful}} time?" [...] sighed Anne rapturously. [...] "It must be splendid <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and recite <b>there.</b> Do you suppose we {{will ever be}} asked to do it, Diana?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is outrageous, simply outrageous!" [...] {{they heard}} in Snopper Duke's high-pitched voice. [...] "How dared you roll such a snowball down these stairs? And how came you <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that snowball <b>up</b> <b>there</b> anyway?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Man, listen, it's so {{sensitive}} {{and it will}} reveal its secrets if you try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> in <b>there</b> and learn it...and learn the sound and contact. You can't play it like a piano 'cause that's another thing all together - The notes are the same but, see, that electricity puts another 'jammie' on you, you know what I mean? You must deal with touch {{and so many other}} thing...and I was very frustrated at first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But they won't {{disappear}} {{before the}} school concert. How am I <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and recite? You {{know there is}} one line in my recitation, 'She waved her lily-white hand,' and I have to wave mine when I say it. Fancy waving a lily-white hand all covered with warts. I've tried every remedy I ever heard of, but nothing does any good. Judy Pineau said if I rubbed them with toad-spit it would take them away for sure. But how am I to get any toad-spit?" ...|$|E
60|$|The miners, {{who went}} {{by the name of}} the Idaho crowd, because they came from that State, encamped next to the doctor's crowd, as they were speedily termed, on account of having a medical man with them, and all became well acquainted before night. The Idaho crowd had just heard of an extra large find being made on Gold Bottom Creek, which flowed into the Klondike River, and they were anxious <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> without delay, and {{consequently}} spent half the night in putting their boat together for an early start on the following morning.|$|E
60|$|She {{followed}} the stream, and, climbing some stairs, came {{out into a}} large, long, empty hay-loft, over {{what had once been}} hunting stables-- the children's wet-day play-place. The deputation dispatched to the house had managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> the schoolroom piano, and one of the curates sat down to it, and began playing dance music, while Miss Mohun, Miss Hacket, and the other ladies began arranging couples for a country dance--all girls, of course, except that Lord Rotherwood danced with the tiny premium girl, and Harry with Primrose. Wilfred and Fergus could not be incited to make the attempt; Mysie offered herself to Dolores, but in vain. 'I hate dancing,' was all the answer she got, and she went off to persuade Lois, the nursery girl. Constance Hacket arranged herself on a chair, and looked out from between two curates; there was no getting at her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have brought}} you a book, granny; it will amuse {{you when you}} are able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and read. <b>There</b> now, no thanks--you {{positively}} must lie down and try to sleep. I see your cheek is flushed with all this talking. Good-day, granny!" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was lying}} abed at eight-thirty on a morning of late June, {{two weeks after}} leaving the Souvenir Company, {{deliberately}} hunting over his pillow for cool spots, very hot and restless in the legs and enormously depressed in the soul. He would have got <b>up</b> had <b>there</b> been anything <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> for. <b>There</b> was nothing, yet he felt uneasily guilty. For two weeks he had been afraid of losing, by neglect, the job he had already voluntarily given <b>up.</b> So <b>there</b> are men whom the fear of death has driven to suicide.|$|R
60|$|Tom, however, {{joined the}} {{listless}} promenade; {{and the first}} time croquet was again mentioned, observed that he had seen the Andersons knocking about the balls in the new gardens by the river; and proposed to go down and try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> a match. <b>There</b> was an instant brightening, and Tom stepped into the drawing-room, and told Daisy to come with them.|$|R
60|$|Refusing {{the company}} of a groom, she made her way towards the stretch of high moor where she had ridden with Courtier a year ago. Here over the short, as yet unflowering, heather, there was a mile or more of level {{galloping}} ground. She mounted steadily, and her spirit rode, as it were, before her, longing <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> among the peewits and curlew, to feel the crisp, peaty earth slip away under her, and the wind drive in her face, under that deep blue sky. Carried by this warm-blooded sweetheart of hers, ready to jump out of his smooth hide with pleasure, snuffling and sneezing in sheer joy, whose eye she could see straying round {{to catch a glimpse of}} her intentions, from whose lips she could hear issuing the sweet bitt-music, whose vagaries even seemed designed to startle from her a closer embracing--she was filled with a sort of delicious impatience with everything that was not this perfect communing with vigour.|$|E
60|$|Then {{two great}} {{locomotives}} came snorting {{out of the}} shadows that wrapped the climbing track, and he grasped the shoulder of his comrade, who did not appear disposed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up.</b> <b>There</b> was a little pointed badinage between those who were starting for the mine and the loungers, {{and in the midst of}} it the big cars rolled into the station. Weston started, and his face grew darkly flushed, for two white-clad figures leaned out over the guard-rail of one of the platforms, and for a moment he looked into Ida Stirling's eyes. There was no doubt that she had recognized him, and he remembered the state of his attire, and became uneasily conscious that Grenfell, who clung to his shoulder, was swaying on his feet. He knew that a man is usually judged by his company, and it was clear that nothing that she might have noticed was likely to prepossess Miss Stirling in his favor. The car, however, swept past him, and with some difficulty he got Grenfell into another farther along the train. Then, while his companions exchanged more compliments with the loungers, the big locomotives snorted and the dusty cars lurched on again.|$|E
60|$|The big {{nest in the}} old inverted-umbrella-shaped {{peach tree}} had a great {{attraction}} for me; I used often to visit it and wonder if I would ever have the power of getting up to it. Oh, what a delight it would be <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> above the nest, and look down into the great basin-like hollow lined with sheep's wool and see the eggs, bigger than turkey's eggs, all marbled with deep red, or creamy white splashed with blood-red! For I had seen carancho eggs brought in by a gaucho, and I was ambitious to take a clutch from a nest with my own hands. It was true I {{had been told by}} my mother that if I wanted wild birds' eggs I was never to take more than one from a nest, unless it was of some injurious species. And injurious the carancho certainly was, in spite of his good behaviour when at home. On one of my early rides on my pony I had seen a pair of them, and I think they were our own birds, furiously attacking a weak and sickly ewe; she had refused to lie down to be killed, and they were on her neck, beating and tearing at her face and trying to pull her down. Also I had seen a litter of little pigs a sow had brought forth on the plain attacked by six or seven caranchos, and found on approaching the spot that they had killed half of them (about six, I think), and were devouring them at some distance from the old pig and the survivors of the litter. But how could I climb the tree and get over the rim of the huge nest? And I was afraid of the birds, they looked so unspeakably savage and formidable whenever I went near them. But my desire to get the eggs was over-mastering, and when it was spring and I had reason to think that eggs were being laid, I went oftener than ever to watch and wait for an opportunity. And one evening just after sunset I could not see the birds anywhere about and thought my chance had now come. I managed to swarm up the smooth trunk to the branches, and then with wildly beating heart began the task of trying to get through the close branches and to work my way over the huge rim of the nest. Just then I heard the harsh grating cry of the bird, and peering through the leaves in the direction it came from I caught sight of the two birds flying furiously towards me, screaming again as they came nearer. Then terror seized me, and down I went through the branches, and catching hold of the lowest one managed to swing myself clear and dropped to the ground. It was a good long drop, but I fell on a soft turf, and springing to my feet fled to the shelter of the orchard and then on towards the house, without ever looking back to see if they were following.|$|E
40|$|Some {{years ago}} {{my wife and}} I used to visit Acapulco in Mexico in the winter. It was my custom then as now <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> early and, <b>there,</b> I would walk around the town, {{especially}} in the market district, before {{the heat of the}} day set in: for the Mexican sun grows increasingly wicked as the day progresses and one is better off swimming than walking at noon...|$|R
50|$|Chembai {{secured a}} similar {{opportunity}} of significance again in 1915. A leading citizen of Ernakulam, named T.A.Duraiswami lyer was conducting an annual Tyagaraja festival which attracted important performers {{of the day}} and a throng of listeners. It was considered a privilege to sing at the festival. Chembai went to Ernakulam and requested Duraiswami lyer a chance for him also to sing. Duraiswami lyer agreed. As customary at such festivals, Chembai sang for the limited time allotted to him and was about <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up,</b> when <b>there</b> was a chorus of requests for one more number and he had to oblige! Here he had forged a friendship with T.G.Krishna Iyer (nephew of Duraiswami Iyer) whose compositions he was to set to classical music, and popularise later.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Walters in an apologetic tone, [...] "I suppose {{all this}} is true, but I must point out that when we slipped down the gully it was {{impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> again. Then <b>there</b> were some big crevasses in the glacier and I had a half-drunk man to help across; I really didn't know he would drink too much when I gave him the flask. However, although perhaps I was rather careless, I hope you won't forbid my seeing Lawrence." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "'Well, {{you ought}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> Get yourselves {{a good look}} around. Get {{the lay of the}} land uphere in New York, because it will {{probably}} be a good long while before you get back up here again.' ...|$|E
50|$|Declared {{a nature}} park in 2002, the Montsant Natural Park is a veritable {{symbol of the}} Priorat and of {{southern}} Catalonia. It is a compact massif, largely surrounded by cliffs and rocky slopes made up of Oligocene conglomerates. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> choose your grau, {{one of the ways}} up and through the cliffs. Some are relatively easy, following old mule tracks, while others are only passable on foot, with dizzying views and some surprises. From the top there are magnificent views, over all the villages nestling at its foot.|$|E
50|$|Navraj names Hans Raj Hans and Daler Mehndi as {{his major}} musical influences. Aged 14, Navraj {{attended}} his first ever concert where Daler Mehndi performed and {{he claims to}} have realised his purpose. He admires Daler Mehndi as an all-around entertainer and Hans Raj Hans, who he said inspired me <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and do what he did. He credits father Hans Raj Hans's singing and his song Haal Ve Rabba- lutti heer ve fakir di as influencing him to begin practicing vocal runs as a young child. His other musical influences include Michael Jackson and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.|$|E
60|$|One evening, after tea, when Rollo was {{a pretty}} big boy, he came and began to climb up into his father's lap. When he had climbed up, he took his place astride of his father's knee, {{as if he were}} riding a horse. His little brother Nathan came up and stood near, wanting <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> too, only <b>there</b> was not room. His cousin James was there, that evening, on a visit. He sat upon a cricket before the fire, and his mother was at the table doing some sort of work.|$|R
5000|$|After {{finishing}} third, Smith said {{he thought}} [...] "it was obvious we played the same strategy that Buescher and those guys did <b>to</b> <b>get</b> ourselves <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> and as Brad alluded to, the cloud kind of came {{at just the right}} time for us. We were within five or six laps of having to pit, but it’s a credit to my guys for seeing the opportunity to do that strategy, and when you’re a small team working hard to try and go up against some of the bigger teams that we do, you’ve got to take the opportunities when they present themselves, and today and this weekend in general, just kind of had that feeling to it with the rain on and off all weekend long, and we were able to make the most out of it, and it’s something I’m proud of them for doing, and happy for Tommy.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{give her}} her scholars, {{and she never}} knows how time passes,' said Mr. Dusautoy. 'But step this way, and I'll show you the best view in Bayford.' He took her up a step or two, to a little turfed mound, {{where there was a}} rustic seat {{commanding}} the whole exquisite view of river, vale, and woodland, with the church tower rising in the foreground. The wind blew pleasantly, chasing the shadows of the clouds across the open space. Albinia was delighted to feel it fan her brow, and her eager exclamations contented Mr. Dusautoy. 'Yes,' he said, 'it was all Fanny's notion. She planned it all last summer when I took her round the garden. It is wonderful what an eye she has! I only hope when the dry weather comes, that I shall be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> enjoy it.' ...|$|R
