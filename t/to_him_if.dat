5|$|After {{the events}} of the Campaign, it is {{revealed}} that Tychus was only released from his prison by Arcturus Mengsk, under the conditions that he had to assassinate Sarah Kerrigan, who had just been de-infested by the Xel'naga artifact's energy pulse. According <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>if</b> she was killed, he would go free. Raynor made the decision right there and blocked a shot from Tychus, intended for Kerrigan, and he shot his friend dead.|$|E
5|$|Nurkse's theory {{discusses}} how {{the poor}} {{size of the}} market in underdeveloped countries perpetuates its underdeveloped state. Nurkse has also clarified the various determinants of the market size and puts primary focus on productivity. According <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>if</b> the productivity levels rise in a less developed country, its market size will expand and thus it can eventually become a developed economy. Apart from this, Nurkse has been nicknamed an export pessimist, as he feels that the finances to make investments in underdeveloped countries must arise from their own domestic territory. No importance should be given to promoting exports.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Detroit and Hull's army wounded American morale, and {{eliminated}} the main American {{force in the}} area as a threat, {{while at the same}} time boosting morale among his own forces. Brock took the American supplies at Detroit and used them for his own forces, particularly the ill-equipped militia. Under prize regulations, a substantial part of the value of the captured military stores would accrue <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> (<b>If</b> he had lived longer, he could have settled his debts.) Brock valued the captured ordnance supplies at £30,000. Finally, the victory secured the support of Tecumseh and the other chiefs in his confederation, who took Brock's actions as both a sign of competence and a willingness to take action.|$|E

5|$|Ajay {{encounters}} Pagan, who chastises him for fleeing at {{the start}} of the game, claiming that he only ever intended to help Ajay. Pagan offers Ajay a final decision: shoot him now, or listen <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>If</b> Ajay shoots Pagan, the game ends immediately and the credits roll. If Ajay instead chooses to listen, Pagan reveals that Ajay's father sent Ishwari to spy on Pagan in the early days of the Golden Path, but they fell in love and had a daughter together, Lakshmana, which would make her Ajay's half-sister. Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale, killed Lakshmana for Ishwari's betrayal, and Ishwari killed him in turn before leaving the country with the infant Ajay. Pagan shows Ajay to a shrine containing Lakshmana's ashes, and Ajay places Ishwari's ashes inside. Pagan then boards a helicopter and departs peacefully, leaving the country in Ajay's hands.|$|E
5|$|The third Confederate brigade in line, under Ambrose Wright, crushed two regiments {{posted on}} the Emmitsburg Road north of the Codori farm, {{captured}} the guns of two batteries, and advanced toward {{a gap in the}} Union line just south of the Copse of Trees. (For a time, the only Union soldiers {{in this part of the}} line were Gen. Meade and some of his staff officers.) Wright's Georgia brigade may have reached the crest of Cemetery Ridge and beyond. Many historians have been skeptical of Wright's claims in his after-action report, which, if correct, would mean he passed the crest of the ridge and got as far as the Widow Leister's house before being struck in the flank and repulsed by Union reinforcements (Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard's Vermont brigade). Others believe his account was plausible because he accurately described the masses of Union troops on the Baltimore Pike that would have been invisible <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he had been stopped earlier. Furthermore, his conversations with General Lee that evening lend support to his claim. It is possible that Lee derived some false confidence from Wright about the ability of his men to reach Cemetery Ridge the following day in Pickett's Charge.|$|E

He did, however, write to commanders stationed throughout the empire requesting their support, and soon reinforcements were arriving in Samarra.

Hollyoaks released promotional pictures of the character being showered with debris from the demolition.|$|E

25|$|The fall of Jerusalem, and {{the death}} of Sibylla at the Siege of Acre in 1190, led to a dispute over the throne of the kingdom. Balian's {{stepdaughter}} Isabella was now rightful queen, but Guy refused to concede his title, and Isabella's husband Humphrey—who had let her cause down in 1186—remained loyal <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>If</b> Isabella were to succeed, she needed a politically acceptable and militarily competent husband, the obvious candidate being Conrad of Montferrat, who also had some claim as Baldwin V's paternal uncle. Balian and Maria seized Isabella and talked her into agreeing to a divorce. There were precedents: the annulment of Amalric I's marriage to Agnes of Courtenay, and the unsuccessful attempts to force Sibylla to divorce Guy.|$|E

According to the terms of the will, Jamie will have {{to be the one to}} end the relationship; it has to be his choice to have nothing to do with Babe. Babe hatches a scheme with Josh to convince Jamie that she and Josh are lovers. Jamie does not believe her and is heartbroken that Babe would not accept his word of Phoebe's will not being important <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he has to give up Babe. Babe and Jamie end their romance due to her scheme.|$|E
25|$|The palace was {{occupied}} by Pope Vigilius, the first pope of the Byzantine Papacy, in 547 during a papal visit to Constantinople. In 550, Vigilius decided that the Placidia Palace was not secure enough for his needs, and moved into the basilica of St. Peter of Hormisdas. From the basilica, Vigilius drafted a document of excommunication of Patriarch Menas and his followers, signed by another dozen Western bishops. Upon its publication, Comitas Dupondiaristes, the praetor of the Plebs, was dispatched to the basilica to arrest Vigilius and the African bishops with him. According to one account, Vigilius clung to the altar, and as the guards attempted to drag him, it toppled, nearly crushing him. The praetor withdrew, leaving several bishops injured. The next day, a group of Byzantine dignitaries convinced Vigilius that no more harm would be done <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> {{he returned to the}} Placidia Palace, which he did. There, Vigilius was more or less placed under house arrest. On the night of December 23/24, 551, Vigilius fled across the Bosporus to the Church of St. Euphemia in Chalcedon. In February, the other bishops, but not Vigilius, were arrested. On June 26, the pope and the emperor reconciled and Vigilius returned to the Placidia.|$|E

500|$|Sections of {{the media}} have often campaigned for a {{particular}} person to be appointed England manager.

500|$|Although Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, he criticized it for {{including}} seven new songs and just nine hits. According <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>if</b> it had been a straight hits collection, with [...] "That's the Way It Is" [...] and [...] "If Walls Could Talk" [...] added to the end, it would have been fine, but padding it with nearly a full album worth of new material hurts it. He also noticed that Dion's first American hit, [...] "Where Does My Heart Beat Now", isn't here, nor is her duet with Barbra Streisand, [...] "Tell Him". Erlewine stated that the best of the hits, like the Meat Loaf-ian epic [...] "It's All Coming Back to Me Now" [...] and [...] "My Heart Will Go On", are certainly among the best adult contemporary songs of the decade. In comparison to the new material, he felt that the danceable [...] "That's the Way It Is" [...] and the [...] "pretty" [...] ballad [...] "If Walls Could Talk" [...] work, but he did not like [...] "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" [...] and [...] "All the Way". According to him, the remaining three new songs [...] "aren't bad", but they're not particularly memorable, especially compared to the hits.|$|E
500|$|Bruno Bettelheim {{remarks that}} [...] "the more simple and {{straightforward}} a good {{character in a}} fairy tale, {{the easier it is}} for a child to identify with it and to reject the bad other." [...] The child identifies with a good hero because the hero's condition makes a positive appeal <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>If</b> the character is a very good person, then the child is likely to want to be good too. Amoral tales, however, show no polarization or juxtaposition of good and bad persons because amoral tales such as [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] build character, not by offering choices between good and bad, but by giving the child hope that even the meekest can survive. Morality is of little concern in these tales, but rather, an assurance is provided that one can survive and succeed in life. Small children can do little on their own and may give up in disappointment and despair with their attempts. Fairy stories, however, give great dignity to the smallest achievements (such as befriending an animal or being befriended by an animal, as in [...] "Puss in Boots") and that such ordinary events may lead to great things. Fairy stories encourage children to believe and trust that their small, real achievements are important although perhaps not recognized at the moment.|$|E

In an effort to warm up to each other they made small talk about their respective record deals with Interscope. By the end of the session, Gaga had created five different hooks for [...] "Chillin" [...] and added her vocals on the track. The rapper added, [...] "It took a while. Once we finally got the ball rolling, it was almost time to go. It was natural though. It's wack when you get in the studio with somebody and it's automatically music time— it feels fake.
