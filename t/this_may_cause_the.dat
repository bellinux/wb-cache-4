25|$|Outdoor-grown {{carnivorous}} plants generally catch {{more than}} enough insects to keep themselves properly fed. Insects may be fed to the plants by hand to supplement their diet; however, carnivorous plants are generally unable to digest large non-insect food items; bits of hamburger, for example, will simply rot, and <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> trap, or even the whole plant, to die.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} {{many of the}} younger {{generation}} of secular Jews have moved away from the crowded city center. There has also been small but steady growth of Orthodox satellite communities in suburbs such as Edegem, Wilrijk and Brasschaat. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> Antwerp community to seem overwhelmingly Haredi to the casual observer.

25|$|Another hazard is the {{resonance}} of the magnetron tube itself. If the microwave is run without an object {{to absorb the}} radiation, a standing wave will form. The energy is reflected {{back and forth between}} the tube and the cooking chamber. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> tube to overload and burn out. For the same reason, dehydrated food, or food wrapped in metal which does not arc, is problematic for overload reasons, without necessarily being a fire hazard.|$|E
25|$|Whistle-blowing is {{a subset}} of dissent. It {{involves}} the expression of dissent to external organizations such as media and political avenues that {{have the power to}} take corrective action. Kassing (2000) believes that the whistle-blowing process begins at the superior–subordinate relationship. If a superior response to an employee's effort to dissent is negative <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> employee to seek other avenues of dissent. In fact, evidence indicates that {{only as a last resort}} do the dissendents finally go public with their tales (Bennis, 2004, Kassing, 2000).|$|E
25|$|While {{studying}} {{the effect of}} biodiesel on a D.P.F. {{it was found that}} though the presence of sodium and potassium carbonates aided in the catalytic conversion of ash, as the diesel particulates are catalyzed, they may congregate inside the D.P.F. and so interfere with the clearances of the filter. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> filter to clog and interfere with the regeneration process. In a study on the impact of E.G.R. rates with blends of jathropa biodiesel it was shown that there was a decrease in fuel efficiency and torque output due to the use of biodiesel on a diesel engine designed with an E.G.R. system. It was found that CO and CO2 emissions increased with an increase in exhaust gas recirculation but NOx levels decreased. The opacity level of the jathropa blends was in an acceptable range, where traditional diesel was out of acceptable standards. It was shown that a decrease in Nox emissions could be obtained with an E.G.R. system. This study showed an advantage over traditional diesel within a certain operating range of the E.G.R. system.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] Cosworth-tuned {{engine is}} heavily {{modified}} from the stock 2.3 litre Duratec. The cylinder head, block, crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons are upgraded by Cosworth. Cosworth also integrates an advanced dry-sump {{with an extra}} internal scavenge pump to distribute the oil. While a dry-sump system requires more oil (more weight), a dry-sump will keep the engine lubricated under hard cornering unlike a wet-sump system. Cosworth also radicalizes the cam shafts and upgrades the exhaust system. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> engine to run a little more [...] "rough" [...] at low RPMs, but it drastically increases performance. The inlet system is also replaced with an advanced, custom roller-barrel system. This increases airflow at full throttle compared to a butterfly inlet, boosting performance. The engine also has a custom chip designed by Cosworth for a further increase in performance.|$|E
2500|$|In the UK, where {{human rights}} {{protected}} by the ECHR are prima facie infringed, the courts apply a doctrine of proportionality {{in place of the}} Wednesbury unreasonableness test. Additionally, proportionality is applied in respect of European Union law. Given these developments, the role of Wednesbury in ordinary administrative law cases has been questioned. It has been suggested that proportionality should supplant unreasonableness as a ground of review. The former has occasionally been regarded as superior to Wednesbury unreasonableness since its [...] "emphasis on balance and justification is taken to offer 'a more structured methodology'". Alternatively, {{it has been suggested that}} proportionality should merge with Wednesbury unreasonableness. It is said to share much in common with the reasonableness doctrine, as [...] "proportionality in the sense of achieving a 'fair balance' has always been an aspect of unreasonableness". As Lord Slynn of Hadley stated in R. (Alconbury Developments Ltd.) v. Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (2001), [...] "trying to keep the Wednesbury principle and proportionality in separate compartments seems... to be unnecessary and confusing". <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> [...] "coherence and comprehensibility" [...] of judicial review to suffer. In any event, as Lord Justice of Appeal John Dyson observed in R. (Association of British Civilian Internees: Far East Region) v. Secretary of State for Defence (2003), [...] "the Wednesbury test is moving closer to proportionality and in some cases it is not possible to see any daylight between the two tests... he result that follows will often be the same whether the test that is applied is proportionality or Wednesbury unreasonableness". However, English courts have been cautious about applying proportionality as it is [...] "often understood to bring courts much closer to reviewing the merits of a decision" [...] than is permitted by the Wednesbury test.|$|E
