500|$|When [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic did {{a parody}} of Gaga's [...] "Born This Way", titled [...] "Perform This Way", he {{included}} a lyrical reference to the meat dress ("I strap prime rib <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> / Cover myself with raw meat / I'll bet you've never seen a skirt steak worn this way") and had a dancer dressed in a similar outfit in the music video.|$|E
500|$|The {{risks of}} her {{profession}} were illustrated when on October 1833 she barely avoided {{being killed by}} a landslide that buried her black-and-white terrier, Tray, her constant companion when she went collecting. She wrote to a friend, Charlotte Murchison, in November of that year: [...] "Perhaps you will laugh when I say that {{the death of my}} old faithful dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before my eyes, and close <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> ... it was but a moment between me and the same fate." ...|$|E
2500|$|The School Badge {{appeared}} for {{the first}} time on the cover of the June Magazine in 1902, and was designed by architect, Robin Dods. The central figure represents Wisdom, standing upon or emerging from, the open book, representing Knowledge. In her hand is a lamp, representing Truth. The school motto Honour before Honours can be found at the base of the badge. [...] The illustration is also a clear reference to the famous verse from Psalm 119:105 [...] "Your word is a lamp <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> and a light to my path." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another Midrash {{taught that}} {{the words of the}} Torah give light to those who study them, but those who do not occupy {{themselves}} with the Torah stumble. The Midrash compared this to those who stand in the dark; as soon as they start walking, they stumble, fall, and knock their face on the ground – all because they have no lamp in their hand. It is the same with those who have no Torah; they strike against sin, stumble, and die. The Midrash further taught that those who study the Torah give forth light wherever they may be. Quoting [...] "Your word is a lamp <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> and a light to my path," [...] and [...] "The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord," [...] the Midrash taught that God offers people to let God's lamp (the Torah) be in their hand and their lamp (their souls) be in God's hand. The lamp of God is the Torah, as [...] says, [...] "For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light." [...] The commandment is [...] "a lamp" [...] because those who perform a commandment kindle a light before God and revive their souls, as [...] says, [...] "The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I hadn't a shoe <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot.</b> As <b>to</b> a stocking, I didn't know such a {{thing by}} name. I passed the day in a ditch, and {{the night in a}} pigsty. That's the way I spent my tenth birthday. Not that a ditch was new to me, for I was born in a ditch.' ...|$|R
60|$|His eyes, {{after first}} meeting mine, {{traveled}} downward <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot.</b> The instant {{he noticed the}} open drawer I saw a change in his face.

I also told him my two smaller toes were hurting pretty badso he x-rayed them again and sure enough they were both broken. Not that it makes much of a difference.
