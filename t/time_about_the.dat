Partly {{as a consequence of}} this favour, in late October 1957 the US McMahon Act was eased to facilitate nuclear co-operation between the two governments, initially with a view to producing cleaner weapons and reducing the need for duplicate testing.

25|$|The Prince wanders {{for some}} time in the park before falling asleep at the green seat {{appointed}} by Aglaya as their meeting place. Her laughter wakes him from an unhappy dream about Nastassya Filippovna, and they talk for a long <b>time</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> letters Aglaya has received. In the letters, Nastassya Filippovna writes that she herself is in love with Aglaya and passionately beseeches her to marry Myshkin, but Aglaya interprets this as evidence that Nastassya Filippovna is in love with him herself, and demands that Myshkin explain his feelings toward her. Myshkin replies that Nastassya Filippovna is insane, that he only feels profound compassion and is not in love with her, but admits that he has come to Pavlovsk for her sake. Aglaya becomes angry, demands that he throw the letters back in her face, and storms off. Myshkin reads the letters with dread, and later that day Nastassya Filippovna herself appears to him, asking desperately if he is happy, and telling him she is going away and will not write any more letters. Rogozhin escorts her.|$|E
25|$|Tensions {{were high}} in New York {{at this time}} due to the recent Seneca Falls Convention, at which 68 women and 32 men out of 300 {{attendees}} signed the now-famous Declaration of Sentiments, which listed men's abuses of women's freedom and rights. The event was still fresh {{in the minds of}} the people of New York, and the Protestant men of Buffalo felt threatened, increasing their strong objection to the educated, Catholic females who were running a now-state funded hospital. Buffalo's elite began speaking out against the Sisters Hospital and its state funding, criticizing its all-female leadership, lack of physicians' influence in decision making, and small staff. In early February 1850, Protestant doctors Josiah Trowbridge, Austin Flint, and James White privately complained to Lord, possibly Buffalo's most influential citizen at the <b>time,</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> administration of the hospital, arguing that three Sisters alone was not proper for the management of an entire hospital.

500|$|Another {{issue that}} needed to be dealt with was the {{possibility}} that the economy would revive. This was initially denied by Mandel (who was quickly forced to revise his opinion, and later devoted his PhD dissertation to late capitalism, analysing the unexpected [...] "third age" [...] of capitalist development). Mandel's perspective mirrored uncertainty at that <b>time</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future viability and prospects of capitalism, not just among all Trotskyist groups, but also among leading economists. Paul Samuelson had envisaged in 1943 the probability of a [...] "nightmarish combination of the worst features of inflation and deflation", worrying that [...] "there would be ushered in the greatest period of unemployment and industrial dislocation which any economy has ever faced". Joseph Schumpeter for his part claimed that [...] "he general opinion seems to be that capitalist methods will be unequal to the task of reconstruction".

500|$|Brezhnev had, {{according}} {{to some of his}} closest advisers, been concerned for a very long <b>time</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> growing military expenditure in the 1960s. Advisers have recounted how Brezhnev came into conflict with several top-level military industrialists, the most notable being Marshal Andrei Grechko, the Minister of Defense. In the early 1970s, {{according to}} Anatoly Aleksandrov-Agentov, one of Brezhnev's closest advisers, Brezhnev attended a five-hour meeting to try to convince the Soviet military establishment to reduce military spending. In the meeting an irritated Brezhnev asked why the Soviet Union should, in the words of Matthew Evangelista, [...] "continue to exhaust" [...] the economy if the country could not be promised a military parity with the West; the question was left unanswered. When Grechko died in 1976, Dmitriy Ustinov took his place as Defense Minister. Ustinov, although a close associate and friend of Brezhnev, hindered any attempt made by Brezhnev to reduce national military expenditure. In his later years, Brezhnev lacked the will to reduce defense expenditure, due to his declining health. According to the Soviet diplomat Georgy Arbatov, the military–industrial complex functioned as Brezhnev's power base within the Soviet hierarchy even if he tried to scale-down investments.|$|E
