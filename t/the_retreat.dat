The Athenians, Tegeans and Spartans, who had been guarding the rear of <b>the</b> <b>retreat,</b> had not even begun to retreat by daybreak. A single Spartan division was thus left on the ridge to guard the rear, while the Spartans and Tegeans retreated uphill; Pausanias also instructed the Athenians to begin <b>the</b> <b>retreat</b> and if possible join up with the Spartans. However, the Athenians at first retreated directly towards Plataea, and thus the Allied battle line remained fragmented as the Persian camp began to stir.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the road}} had been opened between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the convoy {{still had to}} fight through the {{numerous}} Chinese positions on the hills overlooking the road. On {{the first night of}} <b>the</b> <b>retreat,</b> the Chinese struck the convoy in force and inflicted heavy casualties upon 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5). Although strong air cover suppressed most of the Chinese forces {{for the rest of the}} march, the cold weather, harassing fire, raiding parties, and road blocks slowed <b>the</b> <b>retreat</b> to a crawl while inflicting numerous casualties. Despite those difficulties, the convoy reached Hagaru-ri in an orderly fashion on the afternoon of 3 December, with the withdrawal completed on 4 December.|$|E
5000|$|Because the {{advancing}} blade has higher airspeed than <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> blade and generates a dissymmetry of lift, rotor blades {{are designed to}} [...] "flap" [...] - lift and twist {{in such a way}} that {{the advancing}} blade flaps up and develops a smaller angle of attack. Conversely, <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> blade flaps down, develops a higher angle of attack, and generates more lift. At high speeds, the force on the rotors is such that they [...] "flap" [...] excessively, and <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> blade can reach too high an angle and stall. For this reason, the maximum safe forward airspeed of a helicopter is given a design rating called VNE, velocity, never exceed. In addition, it is possible for the helicopter to fly at an airspeed where an excessive amount of <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> blade stalls, which results in high vibration, pitch-up, and roll into <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> blade.|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} weeks of 1919, {{following}} <b>the</b> <b>retreat</b> of the German Ober-Ost forces under Max Hoffmann, Vilnius found itself in a power vacuum. It promptly became the scene of struggles among competing political groups and experienced several internal revolutions.|$|E
50|$|In a retreating-blade stall, however, only <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> half of <b>the</b> helicopter's {{rotor disc}} {{experiences}} a stall. The advancing blade continues to generate lift, but <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> blade enters a stall condition, usually {{resulting in an}} uncommanded increase in pitch of the nose and a roll {{in the direction of}} <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> side of <b>the</b> rotor disc. In counter-clockwise rotating rotor systems (as in most American-made types) this is the left side. In clockwise rotating systems it is a roll to the right.|$|R
50|$|Fully {{articulated}} rotor systems use {{a combination}} of flapping and a horizontal motion that moves <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> blades forward slightly and moves them back again on the advancing side, thus creating more relative airflow and lift on <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> side at <b>the</b> expense of the advancing side.|$|R

5|$|Just as the Germans {{had made}} the halt decision, the Soviet Kalinin, Western and Southwestern Fronts {{launched}} a massive counteroffensive, aimed at driving Army Group Centre back from Moscow. The attacks were especially strong against Third Panzer Group, which had made some of the closest penetrations to the city. In three weeks of confused, savage fighting, Reinhardt extricated his troops from potential encirclement and fell back to the Lama River line. Placed in charge of covering <b>the</b> <b>retreat,</b> Model's harsh, almost brutal, style of leadership now paid dividends as panic threatened to infect the German columns.

5|$|Samakh, in {{the centre}} of a rearguard line {{stretching}} from Tiberias through Samakh and on to Deraa was intended to cover <b>the</b> <b>retreat</b> of three Ottoman armies.

These and other battles fought during the Battle of Nablus including the Third Transjordan attack, also part of the Battle of Megiddo, forced <b>the</b> <b>retreat</b> of the Ottoman Fourth, the Seventh and the Eighth Armies north towards Damascus.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians, {{under heavy}} and {{effective}} {{fire from the}} Israelis inside the bunkers, ceased entering the fort. The Sa'iqa company to the east, under concentrated Israeli tank fire and aerial bombardment, was finally overwhelmed by the Israeli reinforcements, which proceeded towards the fort, opening fire on the main force. Consequently, all Egyptian forces east of the fort attempted to retreat through the marshes. The Israelis attempted to hamper <b>the</b> <b>retreat</b> by dropping smoke capsules over the area from four A-4 Skyhawks. The lack of visibility caused injuries as men tripped and were trampled during <b>the</b> <b>retreat</b> through the marshes.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>retreat</b> {{was made}} even more serious {{by the fact that}} the gendarmes, tasked with {{stabilising}} the front and catching deserters, also fled in panic. The town itself was badly damaged, and the commanding officer of the 46th Regiment, Colonel Bronisław Krzywobłocki, was forced to order <b>the</b> <b>retreat</b> of the remainder of his forces south-west from the town. The rest of the division had no option but to fall back to the line of First World War trenches. During the chaotic withdrawal all the artillery sub-units got lost. By 19:00 hours the town was in Russian hands.|$|E

50|$|When {{dissymmetry}} causes <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> {{blade to}} experience less airflow than {{required to maintain}} lift, a condition called retreating blade stall can occur. This causes the helicopter to roll to <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> side and pitch up (due to gyroscopic precession). This situation, when not immediately recognized can cause a severe loss of aircraft controllability.|$|R
40|$|The Eocene to middle/late Miocene tectonic {{evolution}} of the Kuril arc and backarc region has been simulated with analogue experiments. The experiments simulate asymmetric deformation in the overriding plate due to anticlockwise rollback of the subducting Pacific plate. The results show {{the formation of a}} N-S to NE-SW-oriented dextral shear zone near the far edge of <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> boundary analogous to the Sakhalin-Hokkaido dextral shear zone. Contemporaneously, normal faults and grabens form, striking parallel to <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> boundary near <b>the</b> far edge but striking more oblique near the hinge point and away from <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> boundary. This is similar to extensional structures observed in the Kuril Basin and the Sea of Okhotsk. Furthermore, the model shows that the amount of extension progressively decreases away from <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> boundary. This appears to have also happened in the Kuril-Okhotsk region, as evidenced by crustal thickness variation in the region. Finally, the model results show that extension is increasingly accommodated by the region close to <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> boundary with progressive deformation. This can account for the Eocene-early Miocene extension in the Sea of Okhotsk followed by Miocene spreading in the Kuril Basin...|$|R
