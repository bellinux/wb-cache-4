5|$|Ballard {{left the}} Golden Gophers seventh all-time among team defensemen with 33 goals. He {{was also the}} 74th player in team history <b>to</b> <b>notch</b> 100 points, which also ranked him 11th among defensemen.|$|E
5|$|In 2013–14, Lin was {{replaced}} in the Rockets' starting lineup by Patrick Beverley, and Lin became the second unit's primary ball handler and scoring option as the team's sixth man. Houston liked beginning games with Beverley's defensive pressure, but also preferred increasing Lin's playing time without Harden {{also on the}} court. Lin and Harden were both attacking players offensively, but each struggled defensively. In November, Lin established the highest two-game scoring total of his career, 65 points, including season-highs of 34 points and 11 assists along with a Rockets record-tying nine three-pointers in a start in place of an injured Harden. It {{was followed by a}} 21-point performance in a win at New York. He received a round of applause upon entering the game, though it was more subdued than in his first return against the Knicks. On November 27, Lin sprained his right knee against the Atlanta Hawks, causing him to miss six games. He missed four additional games in December due to back spasms; he started in his return on December 23 with both Harden and Beverley injured—Beverley was estimated to be out four to six weeks due to a fractured right hand. On February 1, 2014, Lin recorded 15 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists—his first career triple-double—in 29 minutes off the bench in a 106–92 home victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. He was the first Rocket <b>to</b> <b>notch</b> a triple-double off the bench since Cedric Maxwell in 1988. However, he went into a shooting slump after the All-Star break, and again experienced problems with his back.|$|E

5000|$|The {{central column}} begins with three notches and then doubles <b>to</b> 6 <b>notches.</b> The process is {{repeated}} {{for the number}} 4, which doubles <b>to</b> 8 <b>notches,</b> and then reversed for the number 10, which is halved <b>to</b> 5 <b>notches.</b> These numbers may not be purely random and instead suggest some understanding {{of the principle of}} multiplication and division by two. The bone may therefore have been used as a counting tool for simple mathematical procedures.|$|R

25|$|Marquis, the 144th Jewish {{player in}} major league history, is sixth all-time in strikeouts among Jewish major leaguer {{pitchers}} and seventh in wins, trailing among others Sandy Koufax, Ken Holtzman, and Steve Stone in both categories. In 2009, he became the second Jewish pitcher <b>to</b> <b>notch</b> at least ten victories in six consecutive seasons, joining Koufax.|$|E
25|$|The team {{got off to}} a shaky {{start making}} 18 errors and only one win in their first four games, but managed <b>to</b> <b>notch</b> wins against all three Brisbane Metro teams in as many weeks following. However, the club's A-Grade success was {{dampened}} by announcement of Canadian Devon Franklin that he would be leaving Australia early to go home before Christmas.|$|E
25|$|Their second tour, in November 2008, was a two-match {{trip to the}} USA. The first match, in San Francisco, {{saw them}} defeat a Pacific Coast XV 39–12. They then {{travelled}} to Salt Lake City {{to take on a}} USA Select XV in one of the first events held in the new Rio Tinto Stadium, and came from behind <b>to</b> <b>notch</b> a 19–14 win.|$|E

50|$|A {{drawing table}} is also {{sometimes}} called a mechanical desk because, for several centuries, most mechanical desks were drawing tables. Unlike the gadgety mechanical desks {{of the second}} part of the 18th century, however, the mechanical parts of drawing tables were usually limited <b>to</b> <b>notches,</b> ratchets, and perhaps a few simple gears, or levers or cogs to elevate and incline the working surface.|$|R
25|$|In 1954/55 New Zealand {{recorded}} the lowest ever innings total, 26 against England. The following season New Zealand achieved its first Test victory. The first 3 Tests of a 4 Test series were won easily by the West Indies but New Zealand won the fourth <b>to</b> <b>notch</b> up its first Test victory. It {{had taken them}} 45 matches and 26 years to attain.|$|E
25|$|The third {{test was}} {{played at the}} M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore, from 25 March to 29 March. India won the toss and elected to bat first. Tendulkar scored 177 <b>to</b> <b>notch</b> up his second hundred of the series as India scored 424 in their first innings. Australia posted a score of 400 through Slater (91) and Mark Waugh (153*), while Kumble took six wickets for India.|$|E
25|$|Matthew Hayden {{broke the}} record for fastest World Cup century, taking 66 balls <b>to</b> <b>notch</b> up the hundred, {{and when he got}} out two balls later the run rate was still more than seven an over.

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words) Antenna patterns {{can be designed}} <b>to</b> have broad <b>notches</b> in regions where clutter and jamming {{are expected to be}} received. A number of narrowband synthesis techniques exist <b>to</b> design <b>notched</b> antenna patterns, but they break down in the presence of wideband signals on arrays which employ a combination of phase and time steering. The authors derive definitions for wideband antenna patterns and present a new synthesis procedure which can be used <b>to</b> design <b>notched</b> patterns for signals having specified bandwidths on any type of array...|$|R

25|$|In May 2004, Li {{returned}} to competition after having not played since 2002. Although she was unranked, she won 26 successive matches <b>to</b> <b>notch</b> three further $25,000 tournament wins and another $50,000 title, increasing her career singles title count to 18, {{only to have}} her winning streak finally snapped by Evgenia Linetskaya in the semifinal of the $50,000 Bronx tournament that August. However, she won her 16th ITF doubles tournament at the same event, the 17th overall doubles title of her career.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Martínez became {{just the}} 9th modern pitcher {{to have a}} second 300-strikeout season, along with Nolan Ryan (6 times), Randy Johnson (third time in 1999, and three more times since), Sandy Koufax (3 times), Rube Waddell, Walter Johnson, Sam McDowell, J. R. Richard, Steve Carlton, and Curt Schilling; Schilling would later add a third 300-K season. An anomaly in power {{pitching}} annals, Martínez is the only 20th-century pitcher <b>to</b> <b>notch</b> 300 strikeouts in a season without being at least six feet tall.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains of}} an early Upper Paleolithic modern human from Peștera Muierilor (Romania) of 35,000 years BP shows a {{morphological}} pattern of European early modern humans, but possesses archaic or Neanderthal features, suggesting European early modern humans' admixture with Neanderthals rather than a full replacement of Neanderthals. These features include a large interorbital breadth, a relatively flat superciliary arches, a prominent occipital bun, an asymmetrical and shallow mandibular notch shape, a high mandibular coronoid processus, the relative perpendicular mandibular condyle <b>to</b> <b>notch</b> crest position, and a narrow scapular glenoid fossa.|$|E
25|$|With a {{successful}} album and single behind them, Mississippi decided {{to hit the}} road. To fill out their live sound, the band was enhanced {{by the addition of}} top musicians including Beeb Birtles (an ex-member of the band Zoot, he had emigrated as a child from The Netherlands to Goble's home town of Adelaide) and drummer Derek Pellicci. The first appearance of the expanded Mississippi took place on 28 October 1972 at Corbould Hall, Ballarat. With various personnel changes, but always including Goble, Birtles and Pellicci, Mississippi would go on <b>to</b> <b>notch</b> up over 400 live performances in 1972–74.|$|E
25|$|The {{receptor}} {{is normally}} triggered via direct cell-to-cell contact, {{in which the}} transmembrane proteins of the cells in direct contact form the ligands that bind the notch receptor. The Notch binding allows groups of cells to organize themselves such that, if one cell expresses a given trait, this may be switched off in neighbouring cells by the intercellular notch signal. In this way, groups of cells influence one another to make large structures. Thus, lateral inhibition mechanisms are key <b>to</b> <b>Notch</b> signaling. lin-12 and Notch mediate binary cell fate decisions, and lateral inhibition involves feedback mechanisms to amplify initial differences.|$|E
40|$|The {{objects of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is to familiarize oneself with {{the basics of}} linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) of homogeneous materials and to specify these problems for composite materials. The work {{is divided into three}} parts. The first part is aimed at the basics of LEFM. The second part is concerned with generalization of LEFM. The third part is oriented to the numerical application of the studied problems <b>to</b> <b>notches</b> composed of two orthotropic materials...|$|R

25|$|Tsonga {{teamed up}} with Michaël Llodra <b>to</b> <b>notch</b> an {{impressive}} victory over Fernando Verdasco and Feliciano López in Davis Cup play against Spain, but then was crushed by Rafael Nadal in his fourth singles rubber, as France lost the tie against Spain 1–4. Tsonga played at the 2011 Open de Moselle, {{where he was the}} top-seeded player. He defeated Mathieu Rodrigues and Nicolas Mahut, and in the semifinals he ended a two-match losing streak against Alexandr Dolgopolov. In the final, Tsonga fought past Ivan Ljubičić in three sets to win the tournament; his first title in almost two years since his triumph in Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{like all}} of the old high voltage equipment, the cars {{featured}} a ten point brass controller with manual acceleration, which required motormen <b>to</b> <b>notch</b> up gradually as the train came up to speed. Should a motorman advance too quickly with the controller handle, however, a device would actually prevent the car's propulsion system from notching up at too rapid a rate. Mounted {{on the top of}} the controller handle was a button which had to be depressed at all times, acting as a deadman's switch, which would automatically apply the train's emergency brakes should the motorman let go. This was a safety feature designed to stop a train should a motorman become incapacitated. Variations of a deadman's switch, or deadman's device, have been used continuously since and are still used on all current New York City Subway rolling stock.|$|E

50|$|To {{accelerate}} the train still further, the traction motors are reconnected in series-parallel connection (2 parallel circuits with 2 series-connected traction motors in each). For this purpose, in starting notch #12 the controller closes {{a pair of}} parallel contactors and opens the bridge contactor. After this the controller moves <b>to</b> starting <b>notch</b> #13, which closes contactors #1 and #2 and opens both field-weakening contactors; this assembles 2 parallel circuits, each of which comprises 2 traction motors {{and a group of}} starting resistances connected in series and has a total resistance of 4.97 ohm. Further notching out of the controller shorts out the starting resistances in pairs until in starting notch #16 all of the starting resistances are shorted out; this corresponds <b>to</b> running <b>notch</b> #3 on the engineer's controller. Moving the controller <b>to</b> starting <b>notch</b> #17 weakens the traction motor field to 67%, and in starting notch #18 the field is weakened <b>to</b> 50%. Starting <b>notch</b> #18 corresponds <b>to</b> running <b>notch</b> #4 on the engineer's controller; this is the maximum notch and allows the train to reach top speed. To coast, the engineer moves the controller handle to 0; this opens the line contactors, thereby shutting off all power to the traction motors, and moves the controller into starting notch #1 (therefore if the traction motors are turned on again, they are connected in series and all the starting resistances are in the circuit).|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{technique was}} developed to predict the tensile strength of notched curved composite beams loaded in bending. Based upon the Damage Zone Model (DZM), the current analysis was applied <b>to</b> <b>notched</b> curved beams with J cross sections. Similar sections composed of a long, discontinuous fiber laminate were tested to failure in four point bend. Predicted and experimental values were compared and results discussed. Discrepancies {{may be due to}} out-of-plane deformations observed during the experiments which are not accounted for in the current analysis...|$|R
