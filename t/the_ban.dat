5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ban</b> on English {{clubs in}} European {{competitions}} ultimately lasted for five years, {{and even when}} <b>the</b> <b>ban</b> was lifted in 1990, Liverpool were not re-admitted; they had to serve an extra year. <b>The</b> <b>ban</b> prevented them qualifying for the European Cup in 1986 (as league champions and FA Cup winners), the UEFA Cup in 1987 (as league runners-up), the European Cup in 1988 (as league champions), the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1989 (as FA Cup winners) and the European Cup in 1990 (as league champions).|$|E
5|$|According to the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, after {{mephedrone}} {{was made}} illegal, a street {{trade in the}} drug emerged, with prices around double those prior to <b>the</b> <b>ban,</b> at £20–£25 per gram. In September 2010, Druglink reported <b>the</b> <b>ban</b> had had a mixed effect on mephedrone use, with it decreasing in some areas, remaining similar in others and becoming more prevalent in some areas. In an online survey of 150 users after <b>the</b> <b>ban,</b> 63% said they were continuing to use mephedrone, half of those used the same amount and half said they used less. Compared to previous surveys, more users purchased it from dealers, rather than the internet. The average price per gram was £16, compared to around £10 before <b>the</b> <b>ban.</b> The 2010 Mixmag survey of 2,500 nightclubbers found one quarter had used mephedrone in the previous month, the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, and it {{was more likely to}} be cut with other substances. Of those who had already used mephedrone prior to <b>the</b> <b>ban,</b> 75% had continued to use it after <b>the</b> <b>ban.</b> Of the various drugs used by the survey participants, users {{were more likely to have}} concerns about it. Interviews with users in Northern Ireland also found the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, to around £30 a gram. Rather than the price rising due to increased scarcity of the drug, it is thought to have risen for two other reasons. Firstly, dealers knew there was still demand for mephedrone, but were aware the supplies may be exhausted in the future. Secondly, the dealers perceived customers were likely to be willing to pay more for an illegal substance.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Hitler's release from prison, {{politics}} in Germany had become less combative and the economy had improved, limiting Hitler's opportunities for political agitation. As {{a result of the}} failed Beer Hall Putsch, the NSDAP and its affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria. In a meeting with the Prime Minister of Bavaria Heinrich Held on 4 January 1925, Hitler agreed to respect the state's authority and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process. The meeting paved the way for <b>the</b> <b>ban</b> on the NSDAP to be lifted on 16 February. However, after an inflammatory speech he gave on 27 February, Hitler was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927. To advance his political ambitions in spite of <b>the</b> <b>ban,</b> Hitler appointed Gregor Strasser, Otto Strasser and Joseph Goebbels to organise and grow the NSDAP in northern Germany. Gregor Strasser steered a more independent political course, emphasising the socialist elements of the party's programme.|$|E
40|$|In 1941, {{during the}} Second World War, <b>the</b> Menzies {{government}} <b>banned</b> Jehovah’s Witnesses, {{giving them the}} distinction of being the only Christian religious body to be banned in Australia during the twentieth century.

This article will redress that situation, based primarily on files from the Attorney-General’s Department, and will argue that <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> of <b>the</b> Witnesses had {{as much to do with}} personal politics and a cavalier attitude to fundamental legal principles of religious freedom as with broader issues of national security...|$|R
