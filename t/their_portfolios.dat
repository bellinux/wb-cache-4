25|$|The Nazi regime never {{attempted}} {{to convince the}} general populace to buy long-term war bonds as had been done during the First World War. The Reich government {{did not want to}} present any perceived form of public referendum on the war, which would be the indirect result if a bond drive did poorly. Rather, the regime financed its war efforts by borrowing directly from financial institutions, using short-term war bonds as collateral. German bankers, with no demonstration of resistance, agreed to taking state bonds into <b>their</b> <b>portfolios.</b> Financial institutions transferred their money to the Finance Department in exchange for promissory notes. Through this strategy, 40 million bank and investment accounts were quietly converted into war bonds, providing the Reich government with a continuous supply of money. Likewise, German bank commissioners compelled occupied Czechoslovakia to buy up German war bonds. By the end of the war, German war bonds accounted for 70% of investments held by Czechoslovakian banks.|$|E

[...] The interviews of individual nominees are conducted separately, in contrast to Parliament’s vote of approval which must be cast on the Commission as a whole without the ability to accept or reject individual Commissioners.

2500|$|Stratfor {{suggested}} {{financial market}} disruption {{is due to}} the political upheaval. Predrag Dukic, senior equity sales trader at CM Capital Markets Bolsa, wrote: [...] "The independence movement seeks to paralyze the region with strikes, disobedience, etc., a nightmare scenario for what until yesterday seemed a strong Spanish economic recovery." [...] Markus Schomer, chief global economist at PineBridge Investments, suggested that the uncertainty both in and outside of Spain has made it hard to price the scenarios into final markets so far. Further he commented a strong approval could result in a euro 0.0255% sell off, just as {{in the aftermath of the}} German federal election the previous week. [...] "I don’t think there is an immediate change coming from that referendum. It'll take quite a bit longer to assess where this is going and what this will mean, how the EU will react, how the Spanish government will react.

2500|$|When Stephen Harper became Prime Minister on February 6, 2006, he did {{not include}} any Ministers of State in his cabinet. Derek Burney, the head of Harper's {{transition}} team, noted to the press that this was intentional: Ministers of State {{and the role of}} Deputy Prime Minister were omitted to create a cabinet of full equals. In actuality, Harper did appoint a number of Ministers of State in order to give certain ministers responsibilities outside of <b>their</b> <b>portfolios,</b> however all of these Ministers of States were also full Cabinet ministers and their formal titles were styled such as to omit [...] "of state". On January 4, 2007, Harper added five Secretaries of State to his ministry thus reviving the practice of appointing junior ministers outside of the Cabinet. On October 30, 2008, Harper added 11 Ministers of State to his Cabinet. On January 4, 2011, Harper added one Minister of State to his Cabinet to a total of 12. In 2015, the 29th cabinet led by Justin Trudeau, formed and updated several ministries including the formation of Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities from the previous junior position Minister of State (Sport).|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, the Bush Administration {{attempted}} {{to create an}} agency to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bill never made progress in Congress, facing sharp opposition by Democrats. In 2005, the Republican controlled House of Representatives passed a GSE reform bill (Federal Housing Finance Reform Act) which [...] "would have created a stronger regulator with new powers to increase capital at Fannie and Freddie, to limit <b>their</b> <b>portfolios</b> {{and to deal with}} the possibility of receivership". However, the Bush administration opposed the bill and it died in the Senate. Of the bill and its reception by the Bush White House, Ohio Republican Mike Oxley (the bill's author) said: [...] "The critics have forgotten that the House passed a GSE reform bill in 2005 that could well have prevented the current crisis. All the handwringing and bedwetting is going on without remembering how the House stepped up on this. What did we get from the White House? We got a one-finger salute." [...] The Bush economic policy regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac changed during the economic downturn of 2008, culminating in the federal takeover of the two largest lenders in the mortgage market. Further economic challenges have resulted in the Bush administration attempting an economic intervention, through a requested $700 billion bailout package for Wall Street investment houses.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, {{following}} the 2014 {{release of the}} APT 1 report from Mandiant, the industry has seen a shift towards signature-less approaches to the problem capable of detecting and mitigating zero-day attacks. [...] Numerous approaches to address these new forms of threats have appeared, including behavioral detection, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud-based file detonation. According to Gartner, it is expected the rise of new entrants, such Carbon Black, Cylance and Crowdstrike will force EPP incumbents into a new phase of innovation and acquisition. One method from Bromium involves micro-virtualization to protect desktops from malicious code execution initiated by the end user. Another approach from SentinelOne and Carbon Black focuses on behavioral detection by building a full context around every process execution path in real time, while Cylance leverages an artificial intelligence model based on [...] machine learning. Increasingly, these signature-less approaches have been defined {{by the media and}} analyst firms as [...] "next-generation" [...] antivirus and are seeing rapid market adoption as certified antivirus replacement technologies by firms such as Coalfire and DirectDefense. In response, traditional antivirus vendors such as Trend Micro, Symantec and Sophos have responded by incorporating [...] "next-gen" [...] offerings into <b>their</b> <b>portfolios</b> as analyst firms such as Forrester and Gartner have called traditional signature-based antivirus [...] "ineffective" [...] and [...] "outdated".|$|E
2500|$|A {{major issue}} for the first Chrétien {{government}} was the large national debt that had been inherited from the Trudeau and Mulroney eras. One of Chrétien's first acts had been to fulfill his Red Book promise not to renew the contract of Bank of Canada governor John Crow, who was replaced with Gordon Thiessen on February 1, 1994. Crow's policy of high interest rates in the early 1990s to achieve 0% inflation had made him almost as unpopular as the GST, indeed so unpopular that Chrétien had promised to fire him if he should become prime minister. Despite the Red Book promise, Chrétien who was fearful of the market reaction if he should sack the Bank of Canada governor, sent the new finance minister Paul Martin to meet with Crow in December 1993 {{to tell him that}} he could remain as governor provided {{that he was willing to}} forgo his 0% inflation target and end the punishingly high interest rates, which Chrétien believed to be a major cause of the recession. Crow told Martin that the government should mind its own business, at which point Chrétien decided to keep his Red Book promise. [...] An important debate that took within the Chrétien government upon taking office was to what with the deputy ministers left over from the Mulroney era, many of whom were Conservatives holding patronage positions within the bureaucracy. Many Liberals wanted a purge of all civil servants associated with the PCs, but Chrétien's aide David Zussman successfully convinced Chrétien that such a purge would be counter-productive, arguing that it would demoralize the civil service and lead to fears that Chrétien was planning on firing all the civil servants who served under Mulroney. Instead, Chrétien summoned all of the deputy ministers to inform them that there would be no purge, but that anyone who did anything that might threaten the Liberals' chance of re-election would be sacked. Because deputy ministers often knew <b>their</b> <b>portfolios</b> considerably better than did the ministers in charge, there were subtle bureaucratic forces pushing the Chrétien government to the right.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} venture capital (VC) syndication creates value for en-trepreneurial firms in two dimensions. First, VC syndication creates product market value for <b>their</b> <b>portfolio</b> firms. Specifically, VC syndicates invest significant amounts in younger firms, in earlier financing rounds, and {{in early stage}} firms. Further, VC syndicates nurture innovation of <b>their</b> <b>portfolio</b> firms and help them achieve better post-initial public offering operating performance. Second, VC syndication creates financial market value for <b>their</b> <b>portfolio</b> firms. Specifically, VC syndicate-backed firms {{are more likely to}} have a successful exit, enjoy a lower initial public offering (IPO) under-pricing, and receive a higher IPO market valuation. The findings are robust to a variety of alter-native syndication measures, subsamples, econometric models, and controlling for endogeneity in VC syndication.
