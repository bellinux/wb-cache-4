5|$|The {{text of the}} cantata {{is taken}} from a 1704 {{collection}} of librettos from Meiningen, many {{of which had been}} set to music in the cantatas of Bach's distant cousin Johann Ludwig Bach, Capellmeister at Meiningen. The librettos have been attributed to his employer Duke Ernst Ludwig von Sachsen-Meiningen. The symmetrical structure of seven movements is typical for this collection: the opening quotation from the Old Testament, followed by a recitative and an aria; then the central quotation from the New Testament, followed by an aria and a recitative, leading into the final chorale. The theme of BWV 39 is an invocation <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> for God's gifts and to share them with the needy.|$|E

25|$|New Westminster {{soon had}} an {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> to Captain Moore, when the bitterly cold winter of 1861-62 froze the Fraser River from Lulu Island to Hope and isolated New Westminster from December until March 12, when Moore used the Flying Dutchman paddlewheel first and spent three days smashing a passage through the ice so supplies could be delivered to the little community.|$|E

In the Reform, Calne's representation was reduced from two to one; Leeds had never been represented before, but now had two members. Though proud to have helped pass the Reform Bill, Macaulay never ceased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> to his former patron, Lansdowne, who remained a great friend and political ally.|$|E
25|$|The {{main problem}} with the food rations {{is that they do}} not {{necessarily}} provide the elements necessary for a basic diet. Furthermore it is insensitive to cultural differences and household needs, leading to refugees considering food assistance as degrading – where they are expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> for inappropriate provisions. Moreover, when, as is frequent, WFP is unable to provide all of these staples, the calories are distributed through whatever commodity is available. There have been times when all of the 1900 calories (i.e. before it was increased to 2,100) were supplied in maize flour. In 1997, refugees had not received any beans or lentils for eight weeks, their only potential source of protein.|$|E

25|$|After Campbell's sections, {{the game}} then cuts to Michael Tapp at his father's {{apartment}} after his suicide. He sees Chief of Police Henry Jacobs, a detective named Joseph, and David Tapp's reclusive neighbor Sarah. Michael also sees Jennings Foster, a forensics specialist {{who was a}} survivor of the first Saw game. Michael is then kidnapped by Pighead and forced to play Jigsaw's game in order to investigate his father's death. After being abandoned by another victim, Solomon Bates, Michael is given another chance. The first victim Michael must save is a college student named Griff whom his father arrested for raping his professor. Michael continues through the hotel, traversing traps, and rescuing a pedophile named Zeke. Immediately afterwards, Michael finds Chief of Police Henry Jacobs in a trap because of being corrupt and selling drugs on the streets. Upon being saved, Henry pretends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> but later meets up with another corrupt policeman, Joseph Poltzer, who together decide to kill Michael because he learned about their drug smuggling operation. Michael then saves Sarah Blalock (who he met earlier but {{turns out to be}} a drug addict) from being drowned in a glass case. Upon being freed, Sarah flees and Michael continues through the hotel to save his next victim.|$|E
500|$|Elgar {{was another}} {{composer}} who had cause <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> to Boult. His Second Symphony had, since its premiere nine years earlier, received few performances. When Boult conducted {{it at the}} Queen's Hall in March 1920 to [...] "great applause" [...] and [...] "frantic enthusiasm", the composer wrote to him: [...] "With the sounds ringing in my ears I send a word of thanks for your splendid conducting of the Sym.... I feel that my reputation {{in the future is}} safe in your hands." [...] Elgar's friend and biographer, the violinist W. H. Reed, wrote that Boult's performance of Elgar's neglected work brought [...] "the grandeur and nobility of the work" [...] to wider public attention.|$|E
500|$|This is a {{farewell}} {{to love and}} life, [...] "an anguished lament and grief built around the words 'muoio disperato' (I die in despair)". Puccini insisted on the inclusion of these words, and later stated that admirers of the aria had treble cause <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> to him: for composing the music, for having the lyrics written, and [...] "for declining expert advice to throw the result in the waste-paper basket". The lovers' final duet [...] "Amaro sol per te", which concludes with the act's opening horn music, did not equate with Ricordi's idea of a transcendental love duet {{which would be a}} fitting climax to the opera. Puccini justified his musical treatment by citing Tosca's preoccupation with teaching Cavaradossi to feign death.|$|E

500|$|The Mercer-Roosevelt affair became wider public {{knowledge}} in 1966, when revealed in [...] "The Time Between the Wars", {{a memoir of}} the decades 1920s and 1930s, written by Jonathan W. Daniels, (1902-1981), a former Roosevelt aide from 1943 to 1945. When {{the news of the}} memoir's contents broke, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr., (1914-1988), said that he had no knowledge of an affair between Rutherfurd and his father, while Rutherfurd's daughter Barbara flatly denied that any such romance had occurred. Well-known historian/author Arthur Schlesinger Jr., (1917-2007), stated of the affair that if Rutherfurd [...] "in any way helped Franklin Roosevelt sustain the frightful burdens of leadership in the second world war, the nation has good reason <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> to her".|$|E
500|$|Nelson {{had been}} hailed in Dublin seven years earlier, after the Battle of the Nile, as {{defender of the}} Harp and Crown, the {{respective}} symbols of Ireland and Britain. When news of Trafalgar reached the city on 8 November, there were similar scenes of patriotic celebration, together with a desire that the fallen hero should be commemorated. [...] The mercantile classes had particular reason <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> for a victory that restored {{the freedom of the}} high seas and removed the threat of a French invasion. Many of the city's population had relatives who had been involved in the battle: up to one-third of the sailors in Nelson's fleet were from Ireland, including around 400 from Dublin itself. In his short account of the Pillar, Dennis Kennedy considers that Nelson would have been regarded in the city as a hero, not just among the Protestant Ascendancy [...] but by many Catholics among the rising middle and professional classes.|$|E
500|$|After {{the early}} {{release of the}} lyrics, it had {{garnered}} criticism from some Asian and Hispanic communities, including Latino groups MECha and Chicanos Unidos Arizona, claiming that the usage of the terms [...] "chola" [...] and [...] "orient" [...] was offensive and derogatory. In response to the lyrics, Robert Paul Reyes of Newsblaze.com stated that while he agreed with its pro-gay stance, he questioned {{the use of the}} term [...] "chola", asking, [...] "Are Latinos supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> that a white superstar, born of privilege, included a racist shout out to our community? Not all Latino ladies are 'cholas' in the barrio, some of them are teachers, writers, engineers and nurses and doctors." [...] Radio stations in Malaysia chose to censor the part of the lyrics dealing with the acceptance of the LGBT community, due to censorship in the country of content that may be deemed offensive. In response, Gaga urged her Malaysian fans, who wanted the uncensored version to be played, to take action by stating: [...] "It is your job and it is your duty as young people to have your voices heard. You must do everything that you can if you want to be liberated by your society. You must call, you must not stop, you must protest peaceably." ...|$|E

500|$|Messenger {{points out}} that Rommel had many reasons <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> to Hitler, {{including}} his interference to arrange for him to receive command of an armoured division, his elevation {{to the status of}} a national hero, and continued interest and support from the dictator. Remy states that the attachment to Hitler went much deeper than any gratefulness could explain, and that Hitler had become Rommel's source of motivation. Some, like Randall Hansen, highlight the similarities in background and personality that facilitated the rapport between the two, while others, like Richard Overy, state that Rommel's main appeal to Hitler was that he was everything Hitler was not, while the political scientist Roland Detsch, in a review of Maurice Remy's book, comments that despite Remy's efforts, the strange relationship remains hard to understand. Wolfram Pyta remarks that Hitler did not compete with Rommel for the war leader image because the two complemented each other perfectly. They were similar {{in the sense that they}} were the only ones with a cultural presence and objects around whom German society's grand narrative was being built, thus Rommel was the only German general who would have been capable of challenging Hitler's rule, had he ever crossed the Rubicon from his [...] "apolitical-to-the-core" [...] military world and developed a serious, critical view of Hitler's political dealings. However, Rommel himself had fallen for Hitler's charisma almost until the end.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{to a total}} of 944 theatres, with an extra 66 being added later. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $2.5million ($ in [...] dollars), becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of that week. The next week it had a 60% decline in sales. The film grossed a total of $7.3million ($ in [...] dollars) worldwide, and was a box office bomb. It was placed at 97 on the top 100 movies of 1987 list. Morton noted that although [...] "Madonna's comic talent was acknowledged, cinemagoers in the United States stayed away in droves." [...] The film was better accepted in the foreign released territories, prompting Madonna to defend herself, rather weakly, that her ideas were better accepted in Europe and Japan, rather than her home country. She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged it with my tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. I also think there are people who don't want me to do well in both fields. I had to really fight to get any respect from the music business and now I guess {{there are some people who}} feel that I ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> for that respect and stick to music." [...] Nevertheless, Warner Bros. decided to release the film in home media in VHS on November 11, 1987, a decision not approved by Madonna.|$|E
500|$|After Webb's death, Gibbons {{remained}} at Oakshott Avenue {{and continued to}} write novels. [...] From 1961 she [...] rented a summer house at Trevone in Cornwall, which became the setting for her 1962 novel The Weather at Tregulla. She returned to literary criticism after many years, when in 1965 she contributed an essay to Light on C.S. Lewis, a review of that writer's work edited by Jocelyn Gibb. In 1966 she wrote an essay for Punch, [...] "Genesis of a Novel", in which she mused on the detrimental effect of Cold Comfort Farm on her long term career. She likened the book to [...] "some unignorable old uncle, to whom you have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> because he makes you a handsome allowance, but is often an embarrassment and a bore". Gibbons made her last overseas trip in 1966, to Grenoble in France where she visited her old friend Elizabeth Coxhead. This visit provided material for her 1968 novel The Snow Woman in which Gibbons overcame her habitual distaste for emotional excess by opening the book with a melodramatic birth on a sofa. The Woods in Winter (1970) was her last published novel; [...] she decided {{at that point that}} she was no longer prepared to subject her work to editorial control. [...] In the 1980s she wrote two more novels for private circulation among friends, The Yellow Houses and An Alpha. These books - An Alpha retitled Pure Juliet - were published by Vintage Classics in 2016, [...] after the manuscripts were released by Gibbons's family.|$|E

500|$|During one scene, Rosa Lee tells Mac, [...] "I say {{my prayers}} {{for you and}} when I thank the Lord for his tender mercies, you're {{at the head of}} the list." [...] Scholar Robert Jewett compares this line to the first verse of Romans 12, in which Paul the Apostle appeals to Christians to live out their lives in service to others [...] "through the mercies of God". Many of the {{elements}} of Mac's redemption, conversion to Christianity and budding relationship with Rosa Lee occur off-camera, including their wedding. Jewett writes, [...] "This is perfectly congruent with the theme of faith in the hidden mercies of God, the secret plot of the life of faith in Romans.... It is a matter of faith, elusive and intangible." [...] Jewett compares Mac's story to that of Abraham, because [...] "just like Sledge's story, [...] centers on the provision of a future through the tender mercies of God". As told in Romans 4, Abraham and his wife Sarah are too old to produce a son, but Abraham develops the faith that God will provide them an heir, which is exactly what occurs, though—as Paul describes—Abraham did nothing practical to guarantee or deserve such a miracle. Jewett describes Mac as similarly undeserving of redemption, based on his selfish and abusive past, typified by his condition in his first encounter with Rosa Lee: in a drunken stupor following a motel room fight. She takes him in and eventually falls in love with him, despite his having done nothing to deserve her care or his redemption: [...] "It is an undeserved grace, a gift of providence from a simple woman who continues to pray for him and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> for him." ...|$|E
