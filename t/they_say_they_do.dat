If I remember rightly, we passed high above wagon roads or through tunnels under them, but never crossed them on their own level. About every quarter of a mile, it seemed to me, a man came out and held up a club till the train went by, to signify that everything was safe ahead.

He professed as much pleasure at our meeting as I certainly felt; but after a few words he went on talking with Mrs. Strange, while I was left to her mother, an elderly woman of quiet and even timid bearing, who affected me at once as born and bred in a wholly different environment. In fact, every American of the former generation is almost as strange to it in tradition, though not in principle, as I am; and I found myself singularly at home with this sweet lady, who seemed glad of my interest in her. I was taken from her side to be introduced to a lady, {{on the opposite side of}} the room, who said she had been promised my acquaintance by a friend of hers, whom I had met in the mountains--Mr. Twelvemough; did I remember him? She gave a little cry while still speaking, and dramatically stretched her hand towards a gentleman who entered at the moment, and whom I saw to be no other than Mr. Twelvemough himself. As soon as he had greeted our hostess he hastened up to us, and, barely giving himself time to press the still outstretched hand of my companion, shook mine warmly, and expressed the greatest joy at seeing me. He said that he had just got back to town, in a manner, and had not known I was here, till Mrs. Strange had asked him to meet me. There were not a great many other guests, when they all arrived, and we sat down, a party not much larger than at Mrs. Makely's.|$|E

5000|$|Reports {{of attitudes}} and {{behaviors}} {{may be subject to}} social desirability bias. Even in cases where respondents are anonymous, people may be less likely to acknowledge behaviors that they see as undesirable. Conversely they {{may be more likely to}} report behaviors that are seen as more desirable. Social desirability bias results from inconsistency between {{attitudes and behaviors}}. This is because although people may have positive attitudes toward behaviors they see as desirable, they do not actually perform the behaviors as often as <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> Studies making claims about behaviors based on reports when behaviors may be seen as desirable may be particularly sensitive to the attitudinal fallacy.

We always strive to be the centre of excellence, as our motto goes,” Aim High”, said the school Principal Mr Joe Sasa.  He praised his staff and attributes the schools great performance to the committed staff that works collectively and tiresly. Even though the school is underesourced and receives limited funds from the government, it does its best to work, within the limited resources to do the best. The principal also highlighted that most of the parents, although semi -literate do value their children’s education and support the schools initiatives in uplifting the academic standard of the learners. This motivates the staff to work hard and help their learners achieve their goals. For the past five years, the school has been ranked in the top ten, best performing schools in Khomas Region, competing with the best private schools in the region.|$|E

They come to Charkhi, the village {{they were forced to}} flee when Pakistan became independent. A pilgrim wants to look for his sister, who he believes survived the violence. The visitors have a mixed reception: a warm welcome from the village barber and hostility from the growing number of young Muslim zealots. Saleem is embarrassed that his mother sent food to the pilgrims and teaches the village girls that non-Muslims can go to heaven. The pilgrim asks some villagers, including Amin, if they knew if a Sikh woman survived the riots. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not know, but Amin later visits the pilgrim's hut and tells him to look for the woman who never goes to the well.

Saleem sees the pilgrim talking to his mother, and hears him call her [...] "Veero" [...] and tell her that her father wanted to see her before he died. Saleem is shocked to learn that Ayesha was Veero, a Sikh; in a flashback, she was amongst a group of village Sikh women lined up to jump into the village well rather than be raped by a Muslim mob in 1947. The Sikh men (including her father) want her to jump, but Veero runs away and is later caught, raped and imprisoned. Her rapist, remorseful, offers to marry her and she begins life as a Muslim.|$|E
