2500|$|Newfound {{goes off}} of the Summative {{assessment}} and Formative assessment continuum. Most of the teachers weigh the summatives as 90% of the overall grade for the quarter and 10% formatives for the overall grade for the quarter. Each quarter (4) is 20% of the overall grade, and exams (midterm/Test (assessment)) are 20% of the final grade. So they factor in 80% from the four quarters, and 20% from the midterm grade and the final exams. <b>That</b> <b>adds</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 100% for the final grade. Formatives would be homework, short essays, and Document-based question. Most of the time, these materials would get you ready for the Summatives. Summatives would be quizzes (sometimes formative), projects, tests, etc. The following table shows the grading table that Newfound goes off of: ...|$|E

[...] Rothkopf praises Joon-ho, stating, [...] " [...] Bong grabs onto the grungy conventions of postapocalyptic adventure with relish. He serves up claustrophobic action scenes (one largely shot in the dark) and ominous, messianic overtones as the band of rebels makes its way forward." ...|$|E
