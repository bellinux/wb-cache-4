Random sampling was arranged on a population of livestocks owned by five merchants at Pekanbaru City Slaughterhouse, three heads respectively.

The variables observed were the evaluation of the application of SSOP, <b>establishment</b> <b>number</b> and microbiological analysis (total plate count, E. coli, Coliform and Salmonella).

The {{aim of this}} thesis is to gather information about Norwegian cell- and <b>tissue</b> <b>establishments</b> to decide in which degree they are learning organizations {{and if they are}} able to fulfil the authorities’ demands about quality and patient safety. A survey has been performed in Norwegian cell- and <b>tissue</b> <b>establishments</b> licensed by The Norwegian Directorate of Health. The survey shows that these establishments cannot entirely be diagnosed as learning organizations. They are not sufficiently open for new ideas and changes and supervisors do not fully support the employees by planning, setting goals and discussing achieved competence when attending training and education. Another important finding was the lack of assign to avoid errors, which will reduce patient safety. Certainty about actions to avoid errors is necessary to promote creativity and quality improvement. Preparing for individual learning together with a strong learning entity can strengthen the learning environment. By simultaneously creating culture for reflection and learning from errors and adverse events, conditions for quality and patient safety will be ensured...|$|R
40|$|AIM: The aims of {{this project}} were to analyze the factors that {{influence}} quality and safety of tissues for transplantation and to develop the method to ensure standards of quality and safety in relation to tissue banking as demanded by European Directive 2004 / 23 /EC and its technical annexes. It is organized in 4 Working Groups, the objectives of each one being focused in a specific area. STANDARDS: The Guide of Recommendations for Tissue Banking is structured into 4 parts: (1) quality systems that apply to tissue banking and general quality system requirements, (2) regulatory framework in Europe, (3) standards available, and (4) recommendations of the fundamental quality and safety keypoints. REGISTRY: This Working Group handled design of a multinational musculoskeletal tissue registry prototype. TRAINING: This Working Group handled design and validation of a specialized training model structured into online and face-to-face courses. The model was improved with suggestions from students, and 100 % certification was obtained. AUDIT: The Guide for Auditing <b>Tissue</b> <b>Establishments</b> provides guidance for auditors, a self-assessment questionnaire, and an audit report form. The effectiveness and sustainability of the outputs were assessed. Both guides are useful for experienced <b>tissue</b> <b>establishments</b> and auditors and also for professionals that are starting in the field. The registry prototype proves it is possible to exchange <b>tissues</b> between <b>establishments</b> throughout Europe. The training model has been effective in educating staff and means having professionals with excellent expertise. Member states could adapt/adopt it. The guides should be updated periodically and perhaps a European organization should take responsibility for this and even create a body of auditors...|$|R

40|$|SummaryPlants have a {{remarkable}} potential for sustained (indeterminate) postembryonic growth. Following their specification {{in the early}} embryo, tissue-specific precursor cells first establish tissues and later maintain them postembryonically. The mechanisms underlying these processes are largely unknown. Here we define local control of oriented, periclinal cell division as the mechanism underlying both the establishment and maintenance of vascular tissue. We identify an auxin-regulated basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor dimer as a critical regulator of vascular development. Due {{to a loss of}} periclinal divisions, vascular tissue gradually disappears in bHLH-deficient mutants; conversely, ectopic expression is sufficient for triggering periclinal divisions. We show that this dimer operates independently of tissue identity but is restricted to a small vascular domain by integrating overlapping transcription patterns of the interacting bHLH proteins. Our work reveals a common mechanism for <b>tissue</b> <b>establishment</b> and indeterminate vascular development and provides a conceptual framework for developmental control of local cell divisions...|$|R

Using the developing zebrafish embryo as a model, we examined the relationship between new myofibril assembly and the organization of the membrane domains involved in cell-extracellular matrix interactions. We determined that depletion of obscurin, a giant muscle protein, resulted in irregular cell morphology and disturbed extracellular matrix organization during skeletal muscle development. The resulting impairment of myocyte organization was associated with disturbance of the internal architecture of the myocyte suggesting that obscurin participates in organizing the internal structure of the myocyte and translating those structural cues to surrounding cells and tissues...|$|R

Patterns of establishment change over time were similar in larger towns, but became increasingly disparate as town size decreased. Sequences of establishment change varied significantly from place to place in no discernible spatial pattern, although towns located along major routes gained establishments after DRC openings slightly more often than towns located elsewhere.
