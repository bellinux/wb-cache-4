40|$|Italy {{exhibits}} a dramatic level of territorial heterogeneity {{in terms of}} socio-economic dynamics and in the economic position of women. We employ this territorial variance {{to assess the impact}} of selected policies and institutions on men's and women's employment using microeconomic data. Such an analysis provides results partly different from what was expected on the basis of cross-country aggregate evidence on industrialized countries. Aggregate growth and <b>tertiarization</b> <b>of</b> the economy are surprisingly found beneficial only to men's employment, while culture and discrimination are relevant for women's. Social Assistance is found highly significant too, with the provision of services being more beneficial to women's employment than monetary transfers. ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{phenomena}} {{make the}} distinction between services and manufacturing obsolete: the <b>tertiarization</b> <b>of</b> manufacturing {{and the introduction of}} information technologies in service industries. Competitiveness of manufacturing firms increasingly depends on the quality of service inputs and on packages of goods and services. Information and communication technologies introduce 'industrial' processes of production in service industries. Hence, it does not make sense any more to use categories such as 'services' or 'manufacturing'. Instead, it would be more meaningful to group economic activities according to input configurations. This paper will discuss these issues {{in the context of the}} supposed German 'service gap'. Copyright � 2007 The Author; Journal compilation � 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{these last}} years, the labour market {{dynamics}} {{have been influenced}} by many factors, as the remarkable growth of female labour participation in the most of European Countries, the <b>tertiarization</b> <b>of</b> economies and the global economic crisis. Nevertheless, many gender disparities in labour market occur even if their incidence is very different across Countries. Analyzing gender differences in labour market means to take into account gender gaps in employment and in wages, but also vertical and horizontal segregation. In this paper differences in labour market between men and women generating segregation are analyzed, focusing specifically on conditions of women working in the tourism sector, trying to understand if there is evidence of a stronger segregation in this sector.

40|$|This book {{serves as}} a sequel to two {{distinguished}} volumes on capitalism: Continuity and Change in Contemporary Capitalism (Cambridge, 1999) and Order and Conflict in Contemporary Capitalism (1985). Both volumes took stock of major economic challenges advanced industrial democracies faced, {{as well as the}} ways political and economic elites dealt with them. However, during the last decades, the structural environment of advanced capitalist democracies has undergone profound changes: sweeping deindustrialization, <b>tertiarization</b> <b>of</b> the employment structure, and demographic developments. This book provides a synthetic view, allowing the reader to grasp the nature of these structural transformations and their consequences in terms of the politics of change, policy outputs, and outcomes. In contrast to functionalist and structuralist approaches, the book advocates and contributes to a 'return of electoral and coalitional politics' to political economy research...|$|R

However, the relation between <b>tertiarization</b> <b>of</b> national economy and its competitiveness remains unclear; personal motivation and public efficiency of an individual attaining tertiary education act {{to a certain extent}} in different directions. The paper addresses different factors affecting the decision of an individual to opt for a particular level of professional education. Net present value and internal rate of return criteria are used to assess the economic attractiveness of investment in attainment of higher professional education. Our findings demonstrate positive private outcomes of attainment of tertiary degrees and are generally in line with the results of OECD analysis. However, cost-benefit analysis demonstrates that in most cases the more advanced type of tertiary degree is attained the lower are financial efficiency indicators both for men and women...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the existence of}} causality among sectoral productivity, services sector expansion, human capital, and aggregate productivity over the period 1970 - 2006 in the Portuguese economy {{taking into account the}} contribution of services sub-sectors with different potential for productivity improvements, market and non-market services. The main aim is to examine whether the increasing <b>tertiarization</b> <b>of</b> the Portuguese economy constituted an obstacle or an opportunity for its aggregate productivity performance and if the expansion of the services sector is related to human capital availability, based on the former disaggregation of the services sector. The evidence suggests bi-directional causality between sectoral and aggregate productivity, with sectoral employment shares and human capital not revealing themselves as relevant for the explanation of the other variables nor being influenced by them. Across services categories, non-market services seem to be the most influential one, making a positive and lasting contribution to aggregate productivity, while market services seem to have had no influence on aggregate productivity dynamics...|$|R

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the specificities of the process <b>of</b> <b>tertiarization</b> <b>of</b> OECD countries. For this purpose, multidimensional analysis of branch-structure of OECD countries is implemented using STAN (Structural Analysis) database. First, an overview of the OECD averages is presented. Then cluster analysis is applied to explain how the countries are grouped on the basis of the similarity of branch-structure. Also the changes in the period 2000 - 2009 are examined. Finally, discriminant analysis is applied to determine the latent indicators that distinguish the branch structure of the OECD countries. Then, the typology of countries and its dynamics, including the process of convergence of income levels, can be viewed in a more general space of discriminant functions...|$|R
40|$|Gender {{equality}} {{is certainly a}} key factor in contributing to the social progress and economic growth of a country and its influential role is most directly illustrated in the female labour force participation. The increase in women’s educational attainment, the changing in their social attitudes and preferences, the improved labor market opportunities due to the <b>tertiarization</b> <b>of</b> the economy, the desire of keeping higher standards of living and the need of economic independence in response to the rise of couple relationship instability (Blau et al., 2010) are only a few of “push” factors of women's job search propensity. After a close examination of socio-economic background and market labour frameworks of European countries, the aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the key determinants of women’s job search propensity in the six Northern countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden) with the highest rates of female labour participation.

40|$|Since the 1980 s Latin America has {{undergone}} its second-worst economic {{crisis of the}} century. This paper explores the reasons for and lessons {{to be derived from}} the vulnerability and the anomalies of the neoliberal restructuring from the 1980 s to the present. Most salient anomalies were structural de-industrialization, privatization with fraud, de-nationalization of national industries, jobless growth, and political corruption. The impact of neoliberal restructuring on society is also enormous: <b>tertiarization</b> <b>of</b> employment, rapid growth of the poor strata, deteriorating quality of social services. Public sector and central power have been gradually losing both the authority and capacity in effectively responding to various social conflicts. So the temptation toward Caesaristic presidency and 'delegative democracy' has been widely spread among the Southern Cone countries. Finally, it is argued that a neostructural alternative based on consensus and democratic institutionalization would be a better option than the neoliberal program which have already produced anti-politics and social anomie.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} depopulation on cultural heritage of Croatian islands. Comprehensive analysis of relevant statistical data and the existing litera¬ture, along with archival and field researches indicate that depopulation {{is the most important}} demographic process on most of the Croatian Islands. As the number of insular population decreases, the insular identity gradually disappears, along with different elements of tangible and intangible cultural heritage. Since the number of young population on the islands is decreasing (and young population is the foun¬dation of biological vitality and economic sustainability) and that cohort is largely affected by <b>tertiarization</b> <b>of</b> economy and modernization of the entire life, there are fewer possibilities for intergenerational transfer of traditional insular culture. This particularly refers to intangible cultural heritage, such as language (rich vocabulary, including a large number of toponyms), music (Glagolitic folk singing, etc.), skills (related to making fishing and agricultural tools, etc.), customs, etc. However, {{it is important to note}} that in modern valorization of insular space, particularly through tourist activities, certain elements of cultural heritage are mostly perceived as cul¬tural fossils deserving special interest, although precisely this cultural tourism can contribute to the presentation and protection as well to optimal economic use of the island cultural heritage...|$|R

The local economic structure of Lefkada island is marked by the continuously declining trajectory of the primary sector; the more or less stabilized trajectory of the secondary sector, which steadily holds the third position in the local economic structure; while the tertiary sector rates first, mainly due to the prevalence of the tourist sector but also the <b>tertiarization</b> trend <b>of</b> the local economy in general.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between economic structure and productivity {{growth has been}} a subject of increasing interest over recent decades. The innovative focus of this paper concerns {{the role of the}} service sector in this relationship at a regional level. Services play a core role in advanced economies, both from a quantitative and a strategic point of view. Traditionally, productivity has been introduced as explaining factor <b>of</b> <b>tertiarization</b> processes in advanced economies, while it has been simultaneously assessed that services display lower productivity levels and growth rates than other economic industries. Nevertheless, in recent years many papers and authors have refuted or limited these conventional theses. This paper focuses on the impact <b>of</b> <b>tertiarization</b> on overall productivity growth, using a sample of European NUTS- 2 regions in the period between 1980 and 2007. The results partially refute traditional knowledge on the productivity of services. Contrary to what conventional theories suggest, this research demonstrates that several tertiary activities have shown dynamic productivity growth rates, while their contribution to overall productivity growth plays a more important role than was historically believed...|$|R
30|$|From 1850 to 2000, one of {{the engines}} of growth was the {{progressive}} conversion of Spain from a rural economy to {{a system in which}} the industry and the tertiary sector play the most important roles. Although most of the consequences of the industrialization and <b>tertiarization</b> <b>of</b> the economy has already been captured by the labor-augmenting technological progress, this process is also partly reflected by the change in the labor share and the depreciation of capital. To capture the effect of the change in labor share and capital depreciation on our results, we run two additional experiments assuming a constant labor share of two-thirds, which corresponds to that reported by Prados de la Escosura and Rosés (2010 b) for 1850, and another with a constant capital depreciation rate at the level of 1850. Prados de la Escosura and Rosés estimate that the labor share in Spain was below two-thirds {{from the beginning of the}} twentieth century until the 1930 s, it was above two-thirds from 1930 until World War II, witnessed a sharp decline at the beginning of the 1950 s, and recovered to pre-Civil War levels after the Stabilization Plan in 1959. The initial capital depreciation rate is estimated at 5.24 %, while the capital depreciation rate at the beginning of the twenty-first century is slightly above 6 %. We also include in the capital depreciation series the estimated 7 % productive capital destruction during the Civil War (Prados de la Escosura and Rosés 2010 a). Table 5 reports that the change in the labor share over the period 1850 – 2000 positively contributed by 7.1 % points to per-capita income growth, whereas the increase of the capital depreciation affected per capita income growth negatively by 1.6 %.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of sectoral structure and its changes in the European and Central Asian countries. In the paper we analyse the sectoral structure in both country groups {{and try to figure out}} the development trends being accompanied by these changes. The paper aims to empirically investigate the relationship between sectoral structure and socio-economic development. One of the essential characteristics of the structural change process is the growing importance of service sector, i. e. tertiarization. The speed and mode <b>of</b> <b>tertiarization</b> can be different. First, this can lead to downsizing industry; second, in countries with high share of primary sector the process can result in downsizing agriculture, without any loss in industry share. A challenging research question for this study is whether the process <b>of</b> <b>tertiarization</b> results from the overall globalization or depends also on the socio-economic development level of a certain country. We use the cross country data about the European Union and OECD member countries as well as Newly Independent States of former Soviet Union on socio-economic development and sectoral distribution of GDP, using data from the World Bank, the United Nations and Freedom House...|$|R
