5|$|Belle Vue Zoological Gardens {{was a large}} zoo, {{amusement}} park, exhibition hall {{complex and}} speedway stadium in Belle Vue, Manchester, England, opened in 1836. The brainchild of John Jennison, the gardens were initially intended to be an entertainment for the genteel middle classes, with formal gardens and dancing on open-air platforms during the summer, but they soon {{became one of the}} most popular attractions in Northern England. Before moving to Belle Vue, Jennison, a part-time gardener, had run a small aviary at his home, the beginnings of the zoo <b>that</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> grew to become the third-largest in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Wales {{has three}} {{national}} parks: Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Pembrokeshire Coast. It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty; Anglesey, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley, the Gower Peninsula, the Llŷn Peninsula, and the Wye Valley. The Gower Peninsula {{was the first}} area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 1956. Forty {{two percent of the}} coastline of south and west Wales is designated as Heritage Coast, with 13 specific designated strips of coastline maintained by Natural Resources Wales (successor body to the Countryside Council for Wales). As from 2012 the coastline of Wales has 43 Blue Flag beaches and five Blue Flag marinas. Despite its heritage and award winning beaches; the south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies/south westerlies <b>that,</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years,</b> have sunk and wrecked many vessels. On the night of 25 October 1859, over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales when a hurricane blew in from the Atlantic. More than 800 lives were lost across Britain because of the storm, but the greatest tragedy was the sinking of the Royal Charter off the coast of Anglesey in which 459 people died. The number of shipwrecks around the coast of Wales reached a peak in the 19th century with over 100 vessels lost and an average loss of life of about 78 sailors per year. Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, Milford Haven and Swansea. Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the Sea Empress oil spill in 1996.|$|E

25|$|The complex {{continued}} until 2004 following {{the merger of}} Granada and Carlton to form ITV plc. As {{a result of the}} merger, ITV plc had (according to the company) an over-capacity of studio facilities and production units around the country, which had previously been rivals, but were now all part of the same group. In order to save money, several large regional headquarters, studio sites and programme departments closed and merged. The decision was taken to close the City Road studios and relocate to a smaller purpose-built complex housing a newsroom and studio, resulting in the loss of up to 30 jobs. A documentary about the move to new premises, The Big Move, reflected <b>that</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> the staff numbers had dropped by about 800, and around 170 people would be moving to the new site.|$|E

It was alleged that the money was used for Arafat's personal expenses. These allegations gradually grew in prominence, which increased Palestinian popular support for the group Hamas, which was often perceived by the Palestinian society as being more efficient and honest, primarily because it had built various institutions and social services. Hamas also stated clearly that it did not recognize Israel's right to exist and did not accept the Oslo peace process nor any other peace process with Israel. in addition, Hamas has openly stated through the years that it has encouraged and organized acts of terrorism against Israelis over the years.|$|E

That same weekend, at the main house, John and Valerie Profumo were among the large {{gathering}} from the worlds of politics and the arts which Astor was hosting in honour of Ayub Khan, the president of Pakistan. On the Saturday evening, Ward's and Astor's parties mingled at the Cliveden swimming pool, which Ward and his guests had permission to use. Keeler, who had been swimming naked, was introduced to Profumo while trying to cover herself with a skimpy towel. She was, Profumo informed his son many years later, [...] "a very pretty girl and very sweet". Keeler did not know, initially, who Profumo was, but was impressed {{that he was the}} husband of a famous film star and was prepared to have [...] "a bit of fun" [...] with him. [...] William Shepherd, a MP trusted by MI5, insisted <b>that</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> he often saw Profumo at louche nightspots, including Murray's Cabaret Club during the time that Keeler had worked there, which made it certain that Profumo knew Keeler before the Clivden party.

500|$|In the 1950 Technicolor western, Comanche Territory, O'Hara {{played an}} unusual {{role as the}} lead {{character}} of Katie Howards, a fiery saloon owner who dresses, behaves and fights like a man, with hair tied back. She [...] "mastered the American bullwhip" [...] during the filming, [...] in a role which Crowther believed was [...] "more significant than a setting sun" [...] in that she [...] "tackles her assignment with so much relish {{that the rest of}} the cast, even the Indians, are completely subdued." [...] She received first billing above co-star Macdonald Carey. O'Hara then appeared as Countess D'Arneau opposite John Payne in Tripoli, directed by O'Hara's second husband, William Houston Price. She was next cast by John Ford in the western Rio Grande, the final installment of his cavalry trilogy. It was the first of five films to be made over 22 years with John Wayne, including The Quiet Man (1952), The Wings of Eagles (1957), McLintock! (1963) and Big Jake (1971), the first three of which were directed by Ford. O'Hara declared that [...] "from our very first scenes together, working with John Wayne was comfortable for me". Her chemistry with Wayne was so powerful <b>that</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> many people assumed that they were married, and newspapers occasionally published sensationalist stories from people claiming to be their love child. In April 1951, she received a call from Universal Pictures that she was cast as a Tunisian princess named Tanya in the swashbuckler film, Flame of Araby (1951). O'Hara [...] "despised" [...] the film and everything it stood for, [...] but had no choice but to make the film or be suspended. By that point of time, she began to grow tired of the roles she was offered and wanted to perform roles that had more depth than the ones she had done thus far.|$|E
