5|$|Part of the canonization of the Zhou yi bound it {{to a set}} of ten commentaries called <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Wings. <b>The</b> <b>Ten</b> Wings are of a {{much later}} {{provenance}} than the Zhou yi, and are the production of a different society. The Zhou yi was written in Early Old Chinese, while <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Wings were written in a predecessor to Middle Chinese. The specific origins of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Wings are still a complete mystery to academics. Regardless of their historical relation to the text, the philosophical depth of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Wings made the I Ching a perfect fit to Han period Confucian scholarship. The inclusion of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Wings reflects a widespread recognition in ancient China, found in the Zuo zhuan and other pre-Han texts, that the I Ching was a rich moral and symbolic document useful for more than professional divination.|$|E

5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) (AMW) fought Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper) (XXX) in an Elimination Last Team Standing {{match in}} the next encounter. Though the match was billed as a Last Team Standing match, it was held under Texas Death match rules. A Texas Death match {{is similar to a}} Last Team Standing match, however, the {{competitor}} must pin or make his opponent submit before the referee begins his count. Daniels pinned Storm following hitting him in the knee with a steel chair to begin <b>the</b> <b>ten</b> count, which Storm failed to make. Daniels was the second to be eliminated, failing to reach <b>the</b> <b>ten</b> count after being pinned following a top rope legdrop by Harris. With the outcome of the match down to the competition between Harris and Skipper, Harris hit Skipper with the Catatonic onto a steel chair. Harris then pinned Skipper to begin <b>the</b> <b>ten</b> count; Skipper did not get to his feet, giving the win to AMW.|$|E
