5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 55,722, Ajax {{took the lead in}} the third minute when Cees de Wolf scored. They {{extended}} their lead in the 17th minute courtesy of a Johan Cruyff goal. Two more goals scored by forward Klaas Nuninga meant Ajax had a 4–0 lead at half-time. Liverpool responded late in the game when defender Chris Lawler scored in the 89th minute; however, Ajax scored a minute later through Henk Groot to win the match 5–1. The spectators could not really see much of the match due to the fog's density and at times could only <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> celebration of the team when a goal was scored.|$|E

500|$|In October 2011, Tricky Stewart told MTV that he {{was back}} in the studio with Perry working on {{leftovers}} from their Teenage Dream sessions. He stated: [...] "Katy and I went into [...] just to address some issues with [...] records that we had done in the past that didn't end up going on , so {{we are in the process}} of just listening and freshening up things and getting ready for something special she has going on", hinting that Teenage Dream would have a re-release. Stewart also added: [...] "We always knew that the records we created were special [...] at the time it was more contractual obligation , I can only have so many songs produced by me on the album, and she honestly didn't need any more records, as you can <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> success of this album, the songs have been flawless." [...] The producer later revealed one of the songs was titled [...] "Dressing Up", saying: [...] "This song is really special. It's called 'Dressing Up,' so it's going to be a big record, I think, it definitely fits. It's right there in what her sensibilities are as a musician and a songwriter. She doesn't change much. She has a very keen musical taste. It'll be really good".|$|E
500|$|The {{town meeting}} {{attracted}} a packed crowd of over a thousand, with Nixon supporters distributing anti-Voorhis literature at the door. The Senate proxies spoke first for their candidates, followed by Voorhis. Nixon, who had notified organizers {{that he would}} be late due to another commitment, arrived during Voorhis's speech, and remained backstage until the congressman had completed his talk. He then came onstage, shook hands with Voorhis, and delivered a fifteen-minute address. A question-and-answer period then followed, with a Nixon supporter asking Voorhis about his onetime Socialist registration, and about his views on monetary policy. [...] After the representative responded, a Voorhis supporter asked Nixon why he was making [...] "false charges" [...] about the supposed Voorhis CIO-PAC endorsement. [...] In response, Nixon reached into his pocket and pulled out a copy of a Southern California NCPAC bulletin mentioning the group's endorsement of Voorhis. [...] The congressman was unaware of the endorsement; those of his aides in the know had [...] "completely forgotten" [...] to tell him. [...] Nixon walked halfway across the stage and displayed it to Voorhis, asking him to read it for himself. Voorhis came from his seat and took it, and (according to Bullock, who served as timekeeper at the debate) [...] "mumbled" [...] that this seemed to be a different organization from the CIO-PAC. [...] Nixon reclaimed the document, and began to read out names {{of the members of the}} boards of directors of the two groups, [...] "It's the same thing, virtually, when they have the same directors." [...] The crowd began to cheer Nixon, who later wrote, [...] "I could <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> audience reaction that I had made my point", and to jeer Voorhis, who wrote, [...] "They'd boo and laugh at my remarks, and this disturbed me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beckett's prose pieces {{during the}} late period were not so {{prolific}} as his theatre, {{as suggested by the}} title of the 1976 collection of short prose texts Fizzles (which the American artist Jasper Johns illustrated). Beckett experienced something of a renaissance with the novella Company (1980), which continued with Ill Seen Ill Said (1982) and Worstward Ho (1984), later collected in Nohow On. In these three [...] "'closed space' stories," [...] Beckett continued his preoccupation with memory and its effect on the confined and observed self, {{as well as with the}} positioning of bodies in space, as the opening phrases of Company make clear: [...] "A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine." [...] "To one on his back in the dark. This he can <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pressure on his hind parts and by how the dark changes when he shuts his eyes and again when he opens them again. Only a small part of what is said can be verified. As for example when he hears, You are on your back in the dark. Then he must acknowledge the truth of what is said." [...] Themes of aloneness and the doomed desire to successfully connect with other human beings are expressed in several late pieces, including Company and Rockaby.|$|E
2500|$|Ringer {{said after}} the game, {{referring}} to being drafted late [...] "I {{think a lot of}} people thought I had a lot of wear and tear on me, too much, so they didn’t know how much I have left, I just kind of laughed it off. I still feel good, and I think because of all that I’ll never be complacent. I feel like I want to prove myself even more, and prove a lot of people wrong. Everything happens for a reason, though." [...] Titans quarterback Kerry Collins said of Ringer [...] "He is a good football player. Some guys are just football players, and Javon Ringer is a football player. He is patient, remarkably patient for a rookie running back. He sees blocking schemes well and has a good feel for when to cut back and when not to cut back. He has shown a lot of moves. I think the kid has a bright future.” Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck also said “He has an understanding of the game, you can <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cuts he makes at times. The way he runs, and the way that he pays attention. You don’t see the coaches get on him much for messing up, so that’s big for a rookie. I’ve been impressed.’’ Tackle Michael Roos also added in, “He sees the block in progress, He can tell when a block is going to be made and he trusts that it will be made, so sometimes he is cutting before the block has even been made. You don’t see that a lot. A few people have that, and he has definitely got it. Hopefully he can get reps with the (first team) a little more and see where it goes from there.’’ ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the attack}} on Peck's ranch the Apaches {{continued}} on towards Sycamore Canyon and the nearby homesteads, some twenty miles south of Arivaca. One of the homesteads was the cattle ranch of John [...] "Yank" [...] Bartlett and his partner Henry [...] "Hank" [...] Hewitt, located {{at the head of}} the canyon. On April 28, the day after the attack at Peck's ranch, a local man named Phil Shanahan was visiting the Bartlett ranch where his ten-year-old son, Little Phil Shanahan, was staying with Johnny Bartlett, the son of Yank Bartlett. Eventually Shanahan decided to ride back to his ranch, a few miles away, leaving his son, Little Phil, at the Bartlett ranch. Shortly after that the boys heard gunfire in the distance and then Shanahan stumbled back into view of the ranch house saying he had been shot. Yank could <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wound that Shanahan needed a doctor so he told his son Johnny to ride to Oro Blanco to get help and alarm the townspeople. Yank also told Little Phil to go back to his home and warn his mother and his sisters. Phil made it to his house without incident and he took his family into the mountains where they hid until the following day. But, while the Shanahans were in hiding, the raiders attacked their house, stealing food, clothing and killing some cattle. Not long after Johnny left, he discovered three men [...] "dressed in black and acting as if they were drunk." [...] Afraid, Johnny turned around and went back, only to find that the Apaches had arrived and were firing into the house. Johnny rode through the firing to the door of the house, he was not hurt but his horse was wounded and died in the doorway. Yank returned the Apache's fire, while at the same time trying to tend to Shanahan's wound, and received a bullet to one of his shoulders, but he remained conscious and continued to fight. When it was dark, Yank sent Johnny out to ride to Oro Blanco again.|$|E
