40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of {{research}} carried out over a two year period between 1995 and 1997. The research, which was qualitative, was carried out in Otago and Canterbury.

The thesis focused on the philosophies of education held by the home schooling parents. These philosophies were based on beliefs of either a pedagogical or religious nature. An analysis of these philosophies revealed that the parents who participated in this research were all making overt political statements by choosing to home school. They resisted traditional notions about education by taking their children home to educate...|$|R

Tenants are visited by social workers, in its visiting works, when the habitants have rental charge debts. Participating observations is common in case studies, but also in fieldwork which was the foundation in our study. Our method of collecting data consisted of a triangulation; unstructured interviews with social workers, participating observations and a following up with a questionnaire. We <b>took</b> <b>part</b> in <b>participating</b> observations of social workers whilst visiting tenants with rental charge debts. The social services in Västerås City are getting 120 - 125 reports concerning rental debts from the landlords every month. We visited 46 tenants and it resulted in 23 of them paying their rental debts. All of the tenants have not paid their rental debts. We have seen how em-powering social workers activity is. Empowerment has been seen in individuals while regain-ing their own power, but also in the community when taking control over their problems with too large rental debts. Empowerment becomes a social work tool, in their visiting work, in helping tenants...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{contribute}} to {{the reliability and validity}} of a series of functional balance tests for use post stroke. Design: Within-session, test/restest and intertester reliability was tested using the kappa coefficient and intraclass correlations. The tests were performed three times and the first and third attempts compared to test the within-session reliability. The tests were repeated a few days later to assess test/retest reliability and were scored simultaneously by two physiotherapists to assess the intertester reliability. To test criterion-related validity the tests were compared with the sitting section of the Motor Assessment Scale, Berg Balance Scale and Rivermead Mobility Index using Spearman’s rho. Setting: Stroke physiotherapy services of six National Health Service hospitals. Participants: People with a post stroke hemiplegia attending physiotherapy who had no other pathology affecting their balance <b>took</b> <b>part.</b> Thirty-five people <b>participated</b> in the reliability testing and 48 people <b>took</b> <b>part</b> in the validity testing. Main outcome measures: The following functional balance tests were used: supported sitting balance, sitting arm raise, sitting forward reach, supported standing balance, standing arm raise, standing forward reach, static tandem standing, weight shift, timed 5 -m walk with and without an aid, tap and step-up tests.

40|$|Purpose: The {{process of}} breast cancer {{follow-up}} has psychosocial benefits for patients, notably reassurance, although attending hospital appointments can increase anxiety. Discharge from hospital follow-up can also invoke anxiety as many patients seek reassurance from continued specialist follow-up. Inevitably, due to increased survival and associated resource issues, opportunities for follow-up and support will be reduced. We delivered and evaluated an intervention which supported the transition from cancer patient to cancer survivor, for breast cancer patients being discharged to primary care. Methods: We delivered and evaluated a pilot of a patient-centred group intervention 'Preparing Patients for Discharge', aimed at reducing distress. Between January and September 2008, 172 participants were recruited and 74 (43) {{expressed an interest in}} participating in the intervention; 32 of 74 <b>took</b> <b>part,</b> and <b>participated</b> in its evaluation using a semi-structured evaluation questionnaire, standardized measures Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Clinical Outcomes for Routine Evaluation (CORE) and independent qualitative interviews. Results: The qualitative analysis of questionnaire data indicated key factors were 1) shared experience, 2) support and reassurance, and 3) positive views about cancer and being discharged. The interview data revealed that the intervention enabled participants to: share experiences, focus on emotional needs, and have open discussions about recurrence, while increasing confidence in being discharged and using alternative support services. However, {{no significant differences were found}} in pre-post-interventions scores of HADS and CORE. Conclusions: Providing a structured group intervention approach for breast cancer patients offers an early opportunity to support cancer survivors and facilitate and encourage self-management.

40|$|Objective: A gene bank, {{comprising}} genetic material, {{environmental and}} family history data, is being {{established in the}} United Kingdom (UK) to improve {{our understanding of the}} etiology of orofacial clefting (OFC). This study aimed to identify factors that might contribute to participation in a cleft gene bank and what issues need to be considered in approaching parents to be included. Design: A qualitative approach was adopted, using focus groups and interviews. Transcripts of audio recordings were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Participants: A UK cleft centre invited 100 families of children born with OFC to participate. Inclusion criteria: any parent of a child aged between 6 months and 16 years willing to <b>take</b> <b>part.</b> Sixteen parents <b>participated.</b> Results: Participants were generally motivated to <b>take</b> <b>part</b> in a cleft gene bank because they value the discovery of new knowledge of the etiology of OFC. They wanted reassurance about the purpose and integrity of the project. Many conveyed shock at the diagnosis of cleft and offered mixed accounts of experiences with healthcare professionals. They suggested an individualized approach from a trustworthy and sensitive professional when being invited to join the gene bank, avoiding difficult times associated with new baby challenges and issues related to the cleft. Conclusions: This pilot study indicates that parents of children born with OFC would be supportive of developing a cleft gene bank but sensitive issues need to be considered...|$|R
40|$|Background Control of {{cervical}} cancer {{in developing countries}} has been hampered by a failure to achieve high screening uptake. HPV DNA self-collection could increase screening coverage, but implementation of this technology is diffi cult in countries of middle and low income. We investigated whether off ering HPV DNA self-collection during routine home visits by community health workers could increase cervical screening. Methods We did a population-based cluster-randomised trial {{in the province of}} Jujuy, Argentina, between July 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2012. Community health workers were eligible for the study if they scored highly on a performance score, and women aged 30 years or older were eligible for enrolment by the community health worker. 200 community health workers were randomly allocated in a 1 : 1 ratio to either the intervention group (off ered women the chance to self-collect a sample for cervical screening during a home visit) or the control group (advised women to attend a health clinic for cervical screening). The primary outcome was screening uptake, measured as the proportion of women having any HPV screening test within 6 months of the community health worker visit. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 02095561. Findings 100 community health workers were randomly allocated to the intervention group and 100 were assigned to the control group; nine did not <b>take</b> <b>part.</b> 191 <b>participating</b> community health workers (94 in the intervention group and 97 in the control group) initially contacted 7650 women; of 3632 women contacted by community health workers in the intervention group, 3049 agreed to participate; of 4018 women contacted by community health workers in the control group, 2964 agreed to participate. 2618 (86...|$|R
