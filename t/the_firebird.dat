5|$|In {{conversations with}} Eidelman, Meyer {{mentioned}} {{that since the}} marches that accompanied the main titles for the previous Star Trek films were so good, he {{had no desire to}} compete with them by composing a bombastic opening. He also felt that since the film was darker than its predecessors, it demanded something different musically as a result. He mentioned the opening to Igor Stravinsky's <b>The</b> <b>Firebird</b> as similar to the foreboding sound he wanted. Two days later Eidelman produced a tape of his idea for the main theme, played on a synthesizer. Meyer was impressed by the speed of the work and the close fit to his vision. Meyer approached producer Steven Charles-Jaffe with Eidelman's CD, which reminded Jaffe of Bernard Herrmann; Eidelman was given the task of composing the score.|$|E
5|$|Monteux {{continued}} {{to play in the}} Concerts Colonne through {{the first decade of the}} century. In 1910 Colonne died and was succeeded as principal conductor by Gabriel Pierné. As well as leading the violas, Monteux was assistant conductor, taking charge of early rehearsals and acting as chorus master for choral works. In 1910 the orchestra was engaged to play for a Paris season given by Sergei Diaghilev's ballet company, the Ballets Russes. Monteux played under Pierné in the world premiere of Stravinsky's <b>The</b> <b>Firebird.</b> In 1911 Diaghilev engaged Nikolai Tcherepnin to conduct the premiere of Stravinsky's Petrushka. Monteux conducted the preliminary rehearsals before Tcherepnin arrived; Stravinsky was so impressed that he insisted that Monteux conduct the premiere.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} six {{pieces were}} recorded at the Medinah Temple in Chicago, {{performed by the}} Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Levine. Pines of Rome was re-arranged in 1993 by Bruce Coughlin, who reduced the four-movement piece by cutting the second movement and trimming sections of {{the third and fourth}} movements. The piece was recorded on March 28, 1994. The second recording involved Symphony No. 5, Carnival of the Animals, and Pomp and Circumstance, on April 25, 1994.

5000|$|<b>The</b> Pottstown <b>Firebirds</b> were a {{professional}} American football minor league team {{and member of}} the Atlantic Coast Football League from 1968 to 1970. <b>The</b> Pottstown <b>Firebirds</b> were former NFL football players, former college football players, and former high school football players who loved to play the game of football. <b>The</b> <b>Firebirds</b> were originally a [...] "farm club" [...] of the Philadelphia Eagles and were provided with equipment/helmets already emblazoned with Eagle wings.

50|$|From 1974 to 1977 <b>the</b> <b>Firebirds</b> were {{a member}} club of the North American Hockey League winning the league's Lockhart Cup {{play-off}} championship in 1976. <b>The</b> <b>Firebirds</b> featured several key players during {{their time in}} Philadelphia. Goaltender Rejean Lemelin moved on from <b>the</b> <b>Firebirds</b> to a long career with Calgary and Boston in the NHL. The tandem of center Bobby Collyard and right wing Gordie Brooks were consistently among the leading scorers in both the NAHL and AHL during their Firebird careers.The <b>Firebirds</b> (and <b>the</b> whole NAHL) played a free-wheeling, high-scoring brand of hockey. Philadelphia averaged over 4.50 goals scored per game during their three NAHL seasons, and averaged 5.94 goals scored per game during the 16 games of their Lockhart Cup championship run in 1976. One playoff game in 1976 between <b>the</b> <b>Firebirds</b> and <b>the</b> Johnstown (Pa.) Jets ended with <b>the</b> <b>Firebirds</b> winning 14-10. Firebird crowds were generally sparse, but over 9,223 fans jammed into the Philadelphia Civic Center to see <b>the</b> <b>Firebirds</b> defeat <b>the</b> Beauce Jaros 5-2 on April 14, 1976 and win the Lockhart Cup, although seating capacity for hockey was only 8,500.|$|R

50|$|When the NAHL {{folded in}} 1977, <b>the</b> <b>Firebirds,</b> along with <b>the</b> Broome Dusters, joined the then-struggling American Hockey League. <b>The</b> <b>Firebirds</b> played all five seasons in Philadelphia (three NAHL and two AHL seasons) at the Philadelphia Civic Center (formerly Convention Hall - see below), {{which has since}} been torn down. <b>The</b> <b>Firebirds</b> were {{affiliated}} with the NHL Detroit Red Wings in 1977-78 and the Colorado Rockies in 1978-79. However, minor league hockey placement of prospects was much less well structured in the 1970s (compared to today), and Philadelphia's roster did not have many top-drawer players. <b>The</b> <b>Firebirds</b> lost their first 10 games of the 1978-79 season before defeating the Hershey Bears on November 10, 1978, {{en route to a}} last place 23-49-8 season.|$|R

50|$|Up {{north in}} Australia, <b>the</b> Queensland <b>Firebirds</b> {{answered}} their shooting problems, by snaring Australian Diamonds star Natalie Medhurst from the Adelaide Thunderbirds. She {{set up a}} wonderful combination with returning Jamaican import Romelda Aiken. In <b>the</b> <b>Firebird's</b> midcourt, Lauren Nourse led the way without Tamsin Greenway, but gained Vixens's Sarah Wall. In <b>the</b> <b>Firebird's</b> defence, both Peta Stephens and Demelza McCloud weren't included in the 2010 season, but they did gain Vixen's Amy Steel to partner with Australian defender Laura Geitz. Despite Greenway choosing to not return for a third year of ANZ Championships netball, <b>the</b> <b>Firebirds</b> pleaded to have {{her back to the}} team when Sarah Wall got a knee injury (ACL) against the Magic.
