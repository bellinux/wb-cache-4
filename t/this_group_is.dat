5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E

5|$|Calbovista {{is usually}} {{classified}} in the family Lycoperdaceae, although the nomenclatural status of <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> unclear, as some authorities lump it into the Agaricaceae. By contrast, Sanford Myron Zeller placed Calbovista in Mycenastracae, a family erected by him in 1948 to contain Calbovista and Mycenastrum, two genera united by similarities in capillitial morphology. Mycenastraceae is not currently considered to have independent taxonomic significance and is folded into synonymy with the Agaricaceae.|$|E
5|$|Carletonomys cailoi is an extinct rodent {{from the}} Pleistocene (Ensenadan) of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Although known {{only from a}} single maxilla (upper jaw) with the first molar, its {{features}} are so distinctive that it is placed in its own genus, Carletonomys. Discovered in 1998 and formally described in 2008, {{it is part of}} a well-defined group of oryzomyine rodents that also includes Holochilus, Noronhomys, Lundomys, and Pseudoryzomys. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> characterized by progressive semiaquatic specializations and a reduction in the complexity of molar morphology.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar, Panthera onca, is {{the only}} extant New World member of the genus Panthera. DNA {{evidence}} shows the lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, snow leopard, and clouded leopard share a common ancestor, and that <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> between six and ten million years old; the fossil record points {{to the emergence of}} Panthera just two to 3.8 million years ago. Phylogenetic studies generally have shown the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) is basal to this group. The position of the remaining species varies between studies and is effectively unresolved.|$|E

5|$|BK targets {{specific}} sub-groups {{within the}} adult market. Products like the BK Stacker and BK XXL {{are aimed at}} late teen to young adult males; health-conscious individuals are offered products such as salads, grilled chicken, and veggie burgers. Products such as the BK Veggie, a meatless burger initially introduced in 2002, target the female and health-oriented demographic using a co-branded marketing program and a patty produced by the Kellogg Company's Morningstar Farms division. Another sub-market in <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> on-the-go parents and commuters; The company's BK Chicken Fries—French-fry cut pieces of breaded chicken—is specifically targeted to this segment. First introduced in 2005, the product was successful enough that Burger King expanded the marketing of chicken fries to the children's demographic with a kid's meal version of the product in 2007. The meal was launched with a cross-promotion in conjunction with Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants. The series of commercials raised the ire of the American Family Association due to perceived nudity concerns.|$|E
5|$|In the North Atlantic, two {{stocks of}} B. m. musculus are recognised. The first is found off Greenland, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> {{estimated}} to total about 500. The second, more easterly group is spotted from the Azores in spring to Iceland in July and August; it is presumed the whales follow the Mid-Atlantic Ridge {{between the two}} volcanic islands. Beyond Iceland, blue whales have been spotted {{as far north as}} Spitsbergen and Jan Mayen, though such sightings are rare. Scientists do not know where these whales spend their winters. The total North Atlantic population is estimated to be between 600 and 1,500. Off Ireland, the first confirmed sightings were made in 2008, since then Porcupine Seabight has been regarded as a prominent habitat for the species along with fin whales. One was sighted along Galicia, Spain, in 2017.|$|E

5|$|The K–Pg {{boundary}} {{represents one}} of the most dramatic turnovers in the fossil record for various calcareous nanoplankton that formed the calcium deposits that gave the Cretaceous its name. The turnover in <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> clearly marked at the species level. Statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a sharp increase in extinctions, than by a decrease in speciation. The K–Pg boundary record of dinoflagellates is not so well understood, mainly because only microbial cysts provide a fossil record, and not all dinoflagellate species have cyst-forming stages, thereby, likely causing diversity to be underestimated. Recent studies indicate that there were no major shifts in dinoflagellates through the boundary layer.|$|E
5|$|The clade Oviraptorosauria is {{generally}} regarded {{as a group of}} non-avian (or non-bird) theropod dinosaurs, and their similarity to birds (Aves) has often been noted. Fossils of oviraptorosaurs in the family Caenagnathidae have historically been confused with those of birds, and some researchers have {{gone so far as to}} consider oviraptorosaurs as a whole more closely related to birds than to other non-avian dinosaurs. In 2002 Lü and colleagues used the then unnamed Nemegtomaia to show similarities between birds and oviraptorosaurs, and found the latter group to be closer to birds than to bird-like dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurs. They therefore concluded that oviraptorosaurs were flightless birds rather than non-avian dinosaurs, and noted that the boundary between birds and dinosaurs was becoming more and more difficult to delineate. Other researchers have instead found dromaeosaurs and troodontids to be most closely related to birds, together forming the group Paraves; oviraptorosaurs, therizinosaurs, and alvarezsaurs are just outside this group. The wider group that includes oviraptorosaurs and Paraves is called Pennaraptora, and <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> defined by the presence of pennaceous feathers (feathers with a stalk).|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} history of <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> not well documented, but the known fossils allow some preliminary conclusions: {{the earliest known}} modern picids were piculet-like forms of the Late Oligocene, about 25 million years ago (mya). By that time, however, the group was already present in the Americas and Europe, and it is hypothesized that they actually evolved much earlier, maybe {{as early as the}} Early Eocene (50 mya). The modern subfamilies appear to be rather young by comparison; until the mid-Miocene (10–15 mya), all picids seem to have been small or mid-sized birds similar to a mixture between a piculet and a wryneck. On the other hand, there exists a feather enclosed in fossil amber from the Dominican Republic, dated to about 25 mya, which seems to indicate that the Nesoctitinae were already a distinct lineage by then.|$|E

5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (carps, catfishes and allies). Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make the bladder vibrate, and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E
