25|$|On February 27, 2017, O'Neill {{ruled that}} he would allow a jury from outside the county but the trial would remain in Montgomery County; he also ruled <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> be sequestered.|$|E
25|$|Those {{witnesses}} and other witnesses from the Forensic Science Service told the Court of Appeal {{that this was}} not the right conclusion to draw from the discovery of the particle of FDR. It was instead no more likely that the particle had come from a gun fired by Barry George than that it had come from some other source. The Court of Appeal concluded that, if this evidence had been given to the jury at the trial, there was no certainty that <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> have found George guilty. For this reason his conviction had to be quashed.|$|E
25|$|On either argument, the {{defendant}} {{would have been}} entitled to an acquittal; however, the court considered it doubtful whether Bailey had laid sufficient basis for his defence to be considered by the jury at all. If so, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> have been entitled to reject it. On {{the facts of the}} case, particularly Bailey's setting out armed with an iron bar, his apparent normality shortly after the incident, and the doctor's evidence as to the unlikelihood of such an episode of automatism in the circumstances, the court considered that there had been no miscarriage of justice. Bailey's appeal was dismissed.|$|E

25|$|In April 2012, it was {{reported}} that Friedkin was suing Universal and Paramount over the domestic rights of Sorcerer for a share of the movie's profits. In a July 2012 interview, Friedkin said that the film's case was pending at the Ninth District Court of Appeals in California with a settlement to be announced by November 26. Had no settlement been reached by that time, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> have to set a trial date for March 2013. The director emphasized that his intent is not dictated by profits but by the desire to have it released on DVD and Blu-ray, as well as having a film print for various outlets, such as film societies and universities. He also highlighted that if this case becomes precedential, he wishes it would help other pictures in a similar situation.|$|E
25|$|Riggins was {{evaluated}} and found competent to stand trial, {{with one of}} the three evaluating psychiatrists dissenting. Riggins stated he planned to present an insanity defense and requested that the Mellaril be discontinued until after the trial so that <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> see his mental state first hand rather than be given a false impression induced by the medication, which would deny him due process. The court heard testimony from three psychiatrists with differing opinions and then gave a one-page decision denying Riggins' request but giving no rationale for the denial. Riggins testified on his own behalf during the trial, claiming that Wade was trying to kill him and that voices in his head told him that killing Wade was justified as self-defense. The jury found Riggins guilty of murder and robbery with a deadly weapon, and sentenced him to death.|$|E
25|$|Exxon {{recovered}} {{a significant portion}} of clean-up and legal expenses through insurance claims associated with the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. Also, in 1991, Exxon made a quiet, separate financial settlement of damages with a group of seafood producers known as the Seattle Seven for the disaster's effect on the Alaskan seafood industry. The agreement granted $63.75million to the Seattle Seven, but stipulated that the seafood companies would have to repay almost all of any punitive damages awarded in other civil proceedings. The $5billion in punitive damages was awarded later, and the Seattle Seven's share could have been as high as $750million if the damages award had held. Other plaintiffs have objected to this secret arrangement, and when it came to light, Judge Holland ruled that Exxon should have told the jury at the start that an agreement had already been made, so <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> know exactly how much Exxon would have to pay.|$|E
25|$|On March 13, 2017, the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court {{issued a}} one-paragraph order setting Allegheny County as the county from which <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> pool <b>would</b> be picked. Allegheny County, which {{includes}} Pittsburgh, is the state's second most-populous county.|$|R

25|$|But on October 30, 2009, Justice Kornreich {{declined}} {{to approve a}} renew and re-argue of her July29 decision holding that SNG could change its club rules, but {{she said that the}} decision only dealt with Rules 49–54, and that everything else about rules changes was dicta (meaning that it was just discussion—not essential to the decision about Rules 49–54 and can not be used as precedent). Further, the court ordered the nomination of a panel of three independent experts who had sat on an America's Cup jury in the past in order to resolve certain outstanding issues. On the basis of the unanimous opinion of those three experts, on November19, 2009, judge Kornreich ruled that: (1) all ballast, whether moveable or not, must be included when measuring the Load Water Line; (2) it would be safe to hold the race in Valencia in February, (3) the Notice of Race and other rules could be issued as little as 16 days before the race, but the matter is moot because SNG had already published the Notice of Race; that Notice of Race could be modified by SNG but any modifications could be challenged by GGYC and would be reviewed by the jury; (4) the question of when the panel of jurors is customarily appointed is moot because <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> soon be named; (5) the arrangements between ISAF and SNG regarding appointment of the jury appeared acceptable.|$|E
500|$|... {{some little}} {{inconsistency}} in the defense, {{and the main}} part of it is this: There will be conversations here where Mr. Glasser wasn't present, where people have seen Mr. Kretske and they have talked about, that they gave money to take care of Glasser, that is not binding on Mr. Glasser, and there is a divergency there, and Mr. Glasser feels that if I would represent Mr. Kretske <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> get an idea that they are together [...] [...] [...] [...]|$|E

It was handled by two Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys of McCulloch's office: Kathi Alizadeh and Sheila Whirley.

2500|$|Historically, {{insanity}} {{was seen}} as grounds for leniency. In pre-Norman times in England there was no distinct criminal code– a murderer could pay compensation to the victim's family under the principle of [...] "buy off the spear or bear it".

2500|$|The {{right to}} a jury is {{protected}} by section 11(f). [...] The Supreme Court considered this right in [...] R. v. Pan; R. v.

[...] The Supreme Court found the erosion of the secrecy of <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> {{have a negative impact on}} the ability of a jury to decide a case and would affect an individual's right to jury trial under section 11(f) of the Charter.

2500|$|Unable to {{convince}} her public defenders to fight for her, Wanrow initially pleaded guilty. [...] Later, following the counsel of a new attorney, she changed her plea to {{not guilty by reason}} of temporary insanity and self-defense. [...] The prosecution alleged that Wanrow was not in any danger and that she took the law into her own hands. [...] This argument relied on ethnic stereotypes <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> have been familiar with from the media, and the verdict may have been influenced by militant actions by the American Indian Movement, which was covered in a negative light in Spokane. [...] In 1973, Wanrow was convicted of second-degree murder and first-degree assault. [...] Defense attorney Eugene I. Annis appealed the ruling on eleven counts of judicial error.

2500|$|Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a {{dissenting opinion}} {{in which he}} argued that Cone's {{attorney}} [...] "entirely fail to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing."

Additionally, Justice Stevens argued that <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> have viewed {{the absence of a}} closing argument as a [...] "concession that no case for life could be made." [...] Justice Stevens also noted that expert witnesses who testified at Cone's postconviction hearings described Cone's attorney's actions as [...] "highly abnormal, and perhaps unprecedented in a capital case." [...] In light of these facts, Justice Stevens argued that the Court should presume that Cone suffered a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, Dr. George Zahorian {{was thought}} to have {{routinely}} distributed steroids and other drugs to WWF wrestlers, supposedly {{with the approval of}} WWF owner Vince McMahon. In 1993, McMahon was indicted in federal court after the steroid controversy engulfed the promotion, forcing him to temporarily cede control of the WWF to his wife Linda. The case went to trial in 1994, where McMahon himself was accused of distributing steroids to his wrestlers. One notable prosecution witness was Nailz (real name: Kevin Wacholz), a former WWF performer who had been fired after a violent confrontation with McMahon. Nailz testified that McMahon had ordered him to use steroids, but his credibility was called into question during his testimony as he repeatedly stated that he [...] "hated" [...] McMahon. The prosecution's intended star witness was Hulk Hogan, but this backfired when Hogan testified that McMahon never told him to take nor tried to sell him steroids. <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> later acquit McMahon of the charges and he resumed his role in the day-to day operations of the WWF.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the first}} four {{audition}} rounds (episodes 1-4), only the jury could decide who would continue to the semi-finals. [...] At any time during a performance, {{each member of the}} jury could push on one of two buttons: a green check mark of approval or a red X for disapproval. [...] When a member of the jury pressed one of the buttons, a loud sound effect let the contestant know that a member of the jury had made a decision and what the decision was. [...] If a contestant received three red X's before the end of their performance, that contestant was eliminated and their performance was abruptly stopped. Sometimes, however, an eliminated contestant could convince the jury to allow them to complete their performance. To continue to the semi-finals, a contestant needed to gain at least two green check marks from the jury. If more than 6 contestants were given 2 or more green check marks in a single program, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> decide {{at the end of the}} program which 6 contestants would continue to the semi-finals.

2500|$|Having {{established}} liability, {{the litigation}} {{turned to the}} remedy. [...] In 1999, McCurn ruled on the appropriate method to calculate damages. [...] The court rejected the state's arguments that damages {{should be limited to}} the fair market value of the land {{at the time of the}} transaction, without pre-judgement interest (the approximate method used by the Indian Claims Commission for statutory claims against the federal government). That same year, the court rejected ejectment as a remedy, thus ensuring that the Cayuga would be unable to recover possession of the lands; their remedy would be limited to monetary damages. The court also determined that joint and several liability would be inappropriate, and thus that the defendants would require separate trials. Finally, the court determined that the state would be able to offset from the eventual damages any amount of consideration paid in the original conveyances as well as the value of infrastructure improvements; moreover, the plaintiff's anthropologist's testimony would not be admissible on the question of valuation, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> not be able to hear evidence on laches from either party, the Eleventh Amendment would not bar damages, and the plaintiffs would not be able to claim emotional, psychological, or cultural damagesonly the economic value of the land.|$|E
2500|$|I made a {{whole series}} of studies to prepare this portrait. Drawings and washes in china ink. I {{analysed}} the architecture of the head in monumentally sized enlargements, two or three times the natural size, I made a certain number of drawings of the hands, I studied the organisation and the overall effect, volumes and the relations of the formal elements between themselves. Finally, I reduced the colour to a harmony of blacks and greys supported by some flashes of light red which set up a contrast, at once breaking with and supporting the interplay of harmonious colour relations. Nayral came regularly to the studio, I worked directly on him, naturally, {{but more often than not}} the work consisted in friendly conversation, in walks in the garden, during which I studied him, watching what was his natural way of walking and what were his usual gestures, above all arming my memory with essential characteristics, trying to isolate his true likeness from the accumulation of details and picturesque superfluities which always interfere with the permanent reality of a being. The portrait was executed without turning to the model, it was finished some weeks before the Automne and I decided to show it... if <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> be willing to accept it, as I was not yet a member.
