Assistant producer Jeff Gullet said that, in the game's recreation of a Return of the Jedi scene where Luke Skywalker [...] "jumps off the plank ... and somersaults onto the skiff", Skywalker [...] "performs an all-out acrobatic routine {{with all sorts of}} jumps from the plank. It's hilarious". LucasArts producer David Perkinson said, [...] "unless you've got the heart of the Emperor, you are going to chuckle at many of [...] the first <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> them – you just have to.

500|$|The opening title {{sequence}} {{was created}} by Kyle Cooper and his company Prologue. He also created the title sequence for the AMC series The Walking Dead and the 1995 film Se7en. The theme music was composed by sound designer Cesar Davila-Irizarry and musician Charlie Clouser. The sequence {{is set in the}} Harmons' basement and includes images of postmortem young children, unborn (or aborted) babies in jars, skulls, a Christening dress, a nurse's uniform, and a figure holding a pair of bloody hedge clippers. Murphy described the sequence as a mini-mystery and stated, [...] "By the <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the ninth episode of this season, every image in that title sequence will be explained".|$|E
500|$|BioShock uses {{a heavily}} {{modified}} Unreal Engine 2.5 {{with some of}} the advanced technologies from Unreal Engine 3. Irrational had previous experience with modifying and expanding on the Unreal Engine in SWAT 4, and continued this advancement of the engine within BioShock. One major improvement they added was improved water effects, given the nature of the game's setting, hiring a programmer and artist just to focus on the water effects. This graphical enhancement has been lauded by critics, with GameSpot saying, [...] "Whether it's standing water on the floor or sea water rushing in after an explosion, it will blow you away every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> it." [...] BioShock also uses the Havok Physics engine that allows for an enhancement of in-game physics, the integration of ragdoll physics, and allows for more lifelike movement by elements of the environment. The Windows version was built to work in both Direct3D 10 (DirectX 10) and DirectX 9, with the DirectX 10 version supporting additional water and particle effects.|$|E

500|$|After {{the tournament}} ended, Moon was congratulated by {{professional}} poker player Phil Hellmuth, who said, [...] "I'm proud of you, Darvin." [...] Some were critical of both Moon and Cada. Mike Matusow, a professional poker player {{with a reputation}} for trash-talking, called the heads-up contest between the two [...] "a new low for poker as a skilled game". Storms Reback, of All In Magazine, said Moon was [...] "out of his league" [...] at the tournament, and made a number of questionable calls and bets. As an example, Reback cited a hand in which Moon attempted to bluff by re-raising a bet by Begleiter for 15 million chips, then folding when Begleiter went all in for an additional 6 million, even though Moon was getting better than 7-to-1 odds on his money. Moon said he planned to spend some of his World Series winnings on putting relatives through college and charitable contributions to his home town, including a new youth ball field and recreation center. Moon said of his victory, [...] "We ain't gonna change. The next <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> us, we'll be wearing jeans and everything else, like we always have." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Oscorp's leading {{scientific}} minds who {{attempts to}} engineer a revolutionary regeneration serum to help regrow limbs and human tissue. Something goes wrong, {{and he is}} transformed into the monster known as the Lizard. Ifans said his character spends {{the majority of the}} film as a human. While playing the 9-foot-tall reptile, Ifans was required to wear a CGI suit. Initially, a large stunt-double was used as a stand-in for the role, but Ifans insisted on portraying the transformed character. Commenting on the technology used to bring his character to life, Ifans continued, [...] "I had a green suit on, and then this cardboard head, and these small claws... Each and every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the Lizard, the technology is so advanced now that when the Lizard's eyes move, they're my eyes. If I frown or show any emotion, they're my emotions. That's how spectacularly advanced technology is." [...] Ifans said that he voiced the man-beast as well, explaining, [...] "I'm sure the voice will be toyed with in the eventual edits, but when I was shooting the CGI moments, when I wasn't actually human, when I was Lizard, I looked like a crash-test dummy in a green leotard thing. There were many moments when I had to speak to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as the Lizard." ...|$|E
500|$|Christie {{commented that}} [...] "people didn't do scenes {{like that in}} those days", and that she found the scenes {{difficult}} to film: [...] "There were no available examples, no role models ... I just went blank and Nic [...] shouted instructions." [...] The scene caused problems with censors {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. [...] The American censor advised Nicolas Roeg explicitly, saying, [...] "We cannot see humping. We cannot see the rise and fall between thighs." [...] The scene's much celebrated fragmented style, in which scenes of the couple having sexual intercourse are intercut with scenes of the couple post-coitally getting dressed to go out to dinner, partly came about through Roeg's attempt to accommodate the concerns of the censors: [...] "They scrutinised it and found absolutely nothing they could object to. If someone goes up, you cut and the next <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> them they're in a different position, you obviously fill in the gaps for yourself. But, technically speaking, there was no 'humping' in that scene." [...] In the end, Roeg only cut nine frames from the sequence, and the film was awarded an R rating in the United States. In Britain, the British Board of Film Classification judged the uncut version to be [...] "tasteful and integral to the plot", and a scene in which Donald Sutherland's character can be clearly seen performing oral sex on Christie's character was permitted, but it was still given an X rating—an adults only certificate.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first game}} of the 2008 season saw Brady suffer a torn ACL in his left knee while {{attempting}} a pass to Randy Moss.
