He rejoins his comrades in Edo, where the group is trapped in Noah's Ark. As <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> a way off the Ark, Allen and his friends fight the Noah. In his rematch with Tyki, Allen {{transforms}} his left arm into a sword which exorcises evil (allowing him to win). When Cross appears and saves Allen from Tyki's new Noah appearance, he directs him to restore the falling Ark by playing a piano. Returning to headquarters, Allen learns {{that he is the}} host of the late 14th Noah (Nea), who betrayed the Earl, was killed and was related to Mana. Before his death, Nea implanted his memories in Allen so he would be reborn. All Exorcists are ordered to kill Allen before he begins transforming into a Noah. While Allen controls his body, he begins turning into Nea; Crown Clown's sword hurts him, despite its only affecting Noah and Akuma.|$|E

25|$|The word base of Esperanto was {{originally}} defined by Lingvo internacia, published by L. L. Zamenhof in 1887. It contained some 900 root words. The {{rules of the}} language allow speakers to borrow words as needed, recommending only that <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> the most international words, and that they borrow one basic word and derive others from it, rather than borrowing many words with related meanings. In 1894, Zamenhof published the first Esperanto dictionary, Universala vortaro, which was written in five languages and supplied a larger set of root words.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1984, all {{dogs are}} {{examined}} by veterinarians/nurses {{before the start}} of the race, who check teeth, eyes, tonsils, heart, lungs, joints, and genitals; <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> signs of illegal drugs, improperly healed wounds, and pregnancy. All dogs are identified and tracked by microchip implants and collar tags. On the trails, volunteer veterinarians examine each dog's heart, hydration, appetite, attitude, weight, lungs, and joints at all of the checkpoints, and look for signs of foot and shoulder injuries, respiration problems, dehydration, diarrhea, and exhaustion. When mushers race through checkpoints, the dogs do not get physical exams. Mushers are not allowed to administer drugs that mask the signs of injury, including stimulants, muscle relaxants, sedatives, anti-inflammatories, and anabolic steroids. , the Iditarod claims that no musher has been banned for giving drugs to dogs.|$|E

He has Sweet Pea locked in a utility closet and confronts the other girls backstage. He shoots Amber and Blondie and attempts to rape Babydoll, but she stabs him with the kitchen knife and steals his master key. Babydoll frees Sweet Pea and starts a fire to keep the orderlies occupied while <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> an exit. They escape into the courtyard, where they find a throng of men blocking their way. Babydoll deduces that the fifth item needed for the escape is in fact her own sacrifice. She concludes that this is actually Sweet Pea's story. Despite Sweet Pea's protests, she insists on revealing herself to the visitors, thus distracting them long enough to allow her friend to slip away unnoticed.|$|E
25|$|Palenque is a {{city and}} {{municipality}} located {{in the north of}} the state of Chiapas, Mexico. The city was named almost 200 years before the famous nearby Mayan ruins were discovered in the 18th century. The area has a significant indigenous population, mostly of the Ch'ol people, a Mayan descendent. The city is the only urban area in a municipality of over 600 communities and it is surrounded by rainforest. However, deforestation has had dramatic effects on the local environment, with howler monkeys occasionally seen in the city itself as <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> food. While most of the municipality’s population is highly marginalized economically, working in agriculture, the Palenque archeological site {{is one of the most}} important tourist attractions for both the area and the state of Chiapas. It is the poorest major city in the state of Chiapas.|$|E
25|$|Ron Harper and James Naughton played Alan Virdon and Peter Burke, two 20th-century American astronauts {{who pass}} through a time warp to a future where apes subjugate humans (unlike the {{original}} film, the humans can speak). Roddy McDowall returned to the franchise as Galen, a chimpanzee who joins the astronauts. Booth Coleman played orangutan Councillor Zaius and Mark Lenard played gorilla General Urko. The episodes portray Virdon, Burke, and Galen as <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> answers, aid downtrodden humans and apes, and avoid the authorities. The show premiered on September 13, 1974, filling CBS' 8–9 p.m. time slot on Fridays. It earned low ratings during its run, a fact the production team attributed to repetitive storytelling and too little screen time for the apes who made the series famous. Given the considerable production costs, CBS cancelled the show after 14 episodes, the last airing on December 20, 1974.|$|E

25|$|As {{human beings}} (Dasein) {{navigate}} their world around them, <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> tools {{and ways to}} accomplish {{what they need to}} do: food and water for survival, instruments to complete tasks, shelter for protection etc. Heidegger theorized that Dasein’s “quest” to exist, so to speak, can only be completed via his relationship with others and his world around him. This is what Slife termed radical relationality: human beings are fundamentally and inescapably relational beings. That human beings exist in-the-world as radically relational beings ultimately means that Dasein must seek out his existence through opportunities that present themselves in his world and through his relationships with others. In other words, what ontological hermeneutics is saying about what nature is that human beings cannot be thought of as merely “self-certain actants” capable of distancing themselves above and against their world effortly to determine rational courses of action, nor as little more than computers that have been programmed to react to stimuli. Instead, all understanding of how to exist comes from being-in-the-world and understanding one’s relation to, or place in, that world. Put another way, human beings conduct themselves within the context of their life-world (the world in which their lives take place) which provides Dasein with possibilities of how to act. It is this understanding of himself in that life-world that informs his choice.|$|E

Males generally stay within a core area all year, whereas females only confine themselves to a core area during the cold wet season, then expand their range throughout the community range during the hot, rainy season. Females expand their traveling range slightly after giving birth, still staying within the core area, but gradually range further in December when they begin stashing their infants with other community members while <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> food.

500|$|The {{earthquake}} made Yamaguchi rethink {{his reasons}} why Sakanaction make music. The {{meaning of a}} documentary-themed album changed after the earthquake, as the band {{felt as if they}} did not have a heavy album that reflected these events, then it could not truly be a documentary. Yamaguchi wrote the songs [...] "Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu" [...] and [...] "Years" [...] directly after the earthquake, as therapy for himself. Realizing that rock bands were no longer a staple of Japanese charts in the early 2010s, Yamaguchi wanted to create a Sakanaction-style pop song that would resonate with a general pop audience, one that listened to idol groups such as Girls' Generation, TVXQ and AKB48. As rock music was no longer so prominent in Japan, Yamaguchi felt that the reasons for people listening to music had changed over time, and wanted to mix rock music with entertainment-focused music in order to give people music that <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>for.</b>|$|E
