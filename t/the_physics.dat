The husband-and-wife team of Gerty Cori and Carl Ferdinand Cori shared the 1947 Prize in Physiology or Medicine as did the husband-and-wife team of May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser in 2014 (along with John O'Keefe).

His son, George Paget Thomson, received the same prize in 1937 for showing that they also have the properties of waves. William Henry Bragg and his son, William Lawrence Bragg, shared <b>the</b> <b>Physics</b> Prize in 1915 for inventing the X-ray spectrometer. Niels Bohr was awarded <b>the</b> <b>Physics</b> prize in 1922, as did his son, Aage Bohr, in 1975. Manne Siegbahn, who received <b>the</b> <b>Physics</b> Prize in 1924, was the father of Kai Siegbahn, who received <b>the</b> <b>Physics</b> Prize in 1981. Hans von Euler-Chelpin, who received the Chemistry Prize in 1929, was the father of Ulf von Euler, who was awarded the Physiology or Medicine Prize in 1970. C. V.

5|$|Some {{knowledge}} of physiology and <b>the</b> <b>physics</b> of diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. <b>The</b> <b>physics</b> and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver {{to understand the}} effects of the diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. <b>The</b> <b>physics</b> mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates <b>the</b> <b>physics</b> to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of barotrauma, DCS, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop the skills necessary for diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.|$|E
