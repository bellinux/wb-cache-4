25|$|There {{is also a}} prefix for medial -w- called gōyōon. When {{combined}} with ka, it produces the obsolete syllable kwa. It may also be fused with the voicing prefix for gwa.

Gōyōon may also be {{combined with}} the vowels i, e, o for foreign wi, <b>we,</b> <b>wo</b> (now <b>that</b> the w in the original Japanese kana for wi, <b>we,</b> <b>wo</b> is silent); with ha, hi, he, ho for fa, fi, fe, fo and (when voiced) for va, vi, ve, vo; and with ta, chi, te, to for tsa, tsi, tse, tso.
