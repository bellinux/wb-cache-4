30|$|Both dyad groups, whether <b>tending</b> {{to search}} {{independently}} or splitting search, {{were significantly more}} accurate than individual searchers (t(11.479)[*]=[*] 5.36, p[*]<[*] 0.001 and t(35.087)[*]=[*] 2.885, p[*]=[*] 0.007, respectively). A final t-test confirmed that dyads <b>tending</b> to search independently were more accurate than those <b>tending</b> to split search (t(8.699)[*]=[*] 3.053, p[*]=[*] 0.014). Dyads who <b>tended</b> to split search took significantly less time to search than individuals (t(37.824)[*]=[*]– 2.83, p[*]=[*] 0.007) {{but there was no}} significant difference between dyads who <b>tended</b> to search independently and individuals (t(5.162)[*]=[*] 1.079, p[*]=[*] 0.328). The difference in search time between dyads who <b>tended</b> to search independently and dyads who <b>tended</b> to split search failed to reach significance (t(4.389)[*]=[*] 2.315, p[*]=[*] 0.076).|$|R
50|$|The {{hypothesis}} implies roughly that {{attitudes of}} the group members will <b>tend</b> to change {{in such a way}} that one's friends' friends will <b>tend</b> to become one's friends and one's enemies' enemies also one’s friends, and one's enemies' friends and one's friends' enemies will <b>tend</b> to become one's enemies, and moreover, that these changes <b>tend</b> to operate even across several removes (one's friends' friends' enemies' enemies <b>tend</b> become friends by an iterative process).|$|R
5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{heating effect}} of binary star systems works {{to prevent an}} initial core collapse of the cluster. When a star passes near a binary system, the orbit of the latter pair <b>tends</b> to contract, releasing energy. Only after the primordial supply of binaries is exhausted due to interactions can a deeper core collapse proceed. In contrast, the effect of tidal shocks as a globular cluster repeatedly passes through the plane of a spiral galaxy <b>tends</b> to significantly accelerate core collapse.|$|E

5|$|A map of {{intensity}} contours is called an isodynamic chart. As the World Magnetic Model shows, the intensity <b>tends</b> to decrease from the poles to the equator.

50|$|Flowers of “Dendrobium pulchellum”, <b>tend</b> to be {{fragrant}} {{with broad}} leaves. The leaves of Charming pulchellum <b>tend</b> {{to be very}} fragile and <b>tend</b> to be larger in size {{when compared to other}} sub-species. They are erect when they are young and as they age they <b>tend</b> to droop due to their increasing size.|$|R
50|$|Feliforms <b>tend</b> to have shorter rostrums than caniforms, fewer teeth, {{and more}} {{specialized}} carnassials. Feliforms <b>tend</b> {{to be more}} carnivorous and are generally ambush hunters. Caniforms <b>tend</b> more toward omnivorous and opportunity-based feeders.|$|R

5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification. Riders won points for {{finishing}} in the top 15 on each stage. Flat stages award more points that mountainous stages, meaning that this classification <b>tends</b> to favour sprinters. In addition, points can be won in intermediate sprints. The winner of the points classification won the red jersey.|$|E

Adoption by same-sex couples {{was supported by}} 56% (35% fully support, 21% <b>tend</b> to support) and opposed by 37% (22% fully oppose, 15% <b>tend</b> to oppose).|$|R

5|$|Although {{multiple}} definitions exist, {{a tension}} pneumothorax {{is generally considered}} to be present when a pneumothorax (primary spontaneous, secondary spontaneous, or traumatic) leads to significant impairment of respiration and/or blood circulation. Tension pneumothorax <b>tends</b> to occur in clinical situations such as ventilation, resuscitation, trauma, or in patients with lung disease.|$|E
5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis that <b>tends</b> to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness <b>tends</b> to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E
5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that <b>tends</b> to turn the front wheel in the direction of the turn, and therefore <b>tends</b> to decrease the turn radius.|$|E

50|$|Sensation seekers <b>tend</b> {{to prefer}} occupations {{involving}} novel, stimulating, and unconventional activities and unstructured tasks requiring flexibility. Low sensation seekers <b>tend</b> to prefer more structured, well-defined tasks involving order and routine. Males high in sensation seeking <b>tend</b> to choose scientific {{and social service}} professions. Among females, traditional vocations (e.g. housewife or home economics teacher) <b>tend</b> {{to be associated with}} low sensation seeking.|$|R

5|$|Ascending cholangitis, {{also known}} as acute cholangitis or simply cholangitis, is an {{infection}} of the bile duct (cholangitis), usually caused by bacteria ascending from its junction with the duodenum (first part of the small intestine). It <b>tends</b> to occur if the bile duct is already partially obstructed by gallstones.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the pulp}} and {{periodontal}} ligament have nociceptors (pain receptors), but the pulp lacks proprioceptors (motion or position receptors) and mechanoreceptors (mechanical pressure receptors). Consequently, pain originating from the dentin-pulp complex <b>tends</b> to be poorly localized, whereas pain from the periodontal ligament will typically be well localized, although not always.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is a {{toxic gas}} that attacks the {{respiratory}} system, eyes, and skin. Because it is denser than air, it <b>tends</b> to accumulate {{at the bottom}} of poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials.|$|E

5|$|Deviations {{can occur}} for small {{droplets}} and during different rainfall conditions. The distribution <b>tends</b> to fit averaged rainfall, while instantaneous size spectra often deviate {{and have been}} modeled as gamma distributions. The distribution has an upper limit due to droplet fragmentation.|$|E
5|$|Ediacaran-type fossils are {{recognised}} globally in 25 localities and {{a variety}} of depositional conditions, and are commonly grouped into three main types, known as assemblages and named after typical localities.
