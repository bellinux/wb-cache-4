50|$|There {{are several}} primary designs for a drum magazine. The most common is the {{cylinder}} type, {{that has a}} spider gear assembly that has an opening in each gear {{for two to three}} rounds of ammunition and can be loaded from the rear, used primarily in the AK-47. Another common design is the double-stack dual-horn drum, which operates like a standard stick magazine, but diverges the ammo into two separate feed chutes that run on a single cog. Rimmed ammunition including shotgun ammunition operated drums primarily run off a cogged (gear shaped) design which feeds each individual round of the ammo from the outermost edge of the drum. Recently a single-stack compact design has been released, which uses most of the interior capacity of the drum. It is driven by a single hub and <b>telescopic</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
40|$|This work {{concerns}} the final design {{phase of a}} drive train system for an innovative four tilting wheels race vehicle, currently in development at the Motorcycle Dynamics Research Group of the University of Padua. The particular kinematic behavior of this prototype imposes some unusual restraints {{in the design of}} the system: in detail, the difference between frame and wheels roll angles leads to research a drive train configuration with high angles articulation capabilities. Moreover, some assembly design constraints have to be taken into account, too: the presence of other components and the small working space require a smart layout solution. The proposed system is composed by a belt or chain, which connects the prop shaft to a differential, and two final drive axles each one composed by two plunging joints and a <b>telescopic</b> interconnecting <b>shaft.</b> This solution has been implemented in a multibody assembly, which comprises an almost complete four tilting wheels vehicle, and studied with regards to its kinematic and dynamic behavior: as a result, it was possible to determine an acceptable solution with regards to geometrical aspects. Moreover, dynamic working conditions have been obtained by simulating some critical maneuvers: the corresponding data led to a correct structural dimensioning phase and drove the selection of compatible component...|$|R
