50|$|All of the {{components}} of a coaxial system should have the same impedance to avoid internal reflections at connections between components. Such reflections may cause signal attenuation and ghosting TV picture display; multiple reflections may cause the original signal to be followed by more than one echo. In analog video or TV systems, this causes ghosting in the image. Reflections also introduce standing waves, which cause increased losses and can even result in cable dielectric breakdown with high-power transmission (see Impedance matching). Briefly, if a coaxial cable is open, the termination has nearly infinite resistance, this causes reflections; if the coaxial cable is short-circuited, the <b>termination</b> <b>resistance</b> is nearly zero, there will be reflections with the opposite polarity.

Data on leg glucose uptake were expressed relative to accurate measures of leg muscle mass by MRI scanning. Muscle strength (239 ± 43 vs. 208 ± 33 N m), quadriceps area (8463 ± 453 vs. 7763 ± 329 mm 2) and glycogen content (458 ± 22 vs. 400 ± 26 mmol (kg dry weight muscle) − 1) decreased, while myosin heavy chain isoform IIX increased 4 -fold in dT vs. T, respectively (all P < 0. 05). GLUT 4 mRNA levels and enzyme activities and mRNA levels of glycolytic, lipolytic and glyconeogenic enzymes did not change with de-training. Likewise, capillary density did not change.

40|$|Low-swing on-chip {{interconnect}} circuits {{have been}} viewed as alternative {{solutions to the problem}} of delay and power increase of on-chip interconnects. This thesis aims to characterize and optimize several basic low-swing interconnect circuits, by developing simple delay and power estimation methodologies. Accuracies of the proposed methods are validated against SPICE-based simulations on the 90 nm technology node. Based on the delay and power estimation methods developed, optimum power-delay trade-off curves are obtained and directly used for comparison among different interconnect circuit strategies. Three low-swing techniques are included, i. e. conventional level converter (CLC), pseudodifferential interconnect circuit (PDIFF), and current-mode signaling (CM). These techniques represent significantly different driver and receiver topologies, where CLC uses lower supply voltage of a normal inverter driver, PDIFF uses NMOS only drivers, while CM has a low impedance termination at the receiving end. In addition, an optimized full-swing repeater-based technique is included as a baseline for comparison. A simplified repeater performance estimation technique considering ramp input signals is also proposed. The most important step in estimating delay of different driver circuits is the accurate estimation of transistor effective resistance, which considers velocity saturation effects and voltage transition patterns. Optimization for the CM circuit for on-chip interconnects requires completely different treatment than the voltage-mode circuits, due to the different and more complex effective driver resistance and <b>termination</b> <b>resistance</b> modeling. Sizing the driver and receiver transistors should be done simultaneously as their resistive values which affect its performance are dependent on each other. Optimum transistor sizing is very dependent on the required voltage swing chosen. Results of our comparisons show that optimized CLC (reduced voltage supply) repeaters appears to give the best general performance with a slight delay overhead compared to full-swing repeaters. The fact that CLC with repeaters has shorter delay than single-segment CM and PDIFF highlights the effectiveness of repeater structures in long wires. The inclusion of inductance and closed-form solutions to derive optimum transistor sizings for various low-swing interconnect circuits may be developed as a future work using delay and power estimation models presented in this thesis, which is a challenging task to do considering the non-linear equations involved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Previously, {{only the}} rising {{phase of the}} action {{potential}} (AP) in cardiac muscle and smooth muscle could be simulated due to the instability of PSpice upon insertion of a second black box (BB) into the K + leg of the basic membrane unit. This restriction was acceptable because only the transmission of excitation from one cell to the next was investigated. Methods In the current work, the repolarization of the AP was accomplished by inserting a second BB into the Ca ++ leg of the basic membrane unit. Repolarization of the AP was produced, not through an activation of the K + channel conductance, but rather through a mimicking of the deactivation of the Ca ++ channel conductance. Propagation of complete APs was studied in a chain (strand) of 10 smooth muscle cells, in which various numbers of gap-junction (gj) channels (assumed to be 100 pS each) were inserted across the cell junctions. Results The shunt resistance across the junctions produced by the gj-channels (R gj) was varied from 100, 000 MΩ (0 gj-channels) to 10, 000 MΩ (1 gj-channel), to 1, 000 MΩ (10 channels), to 100 MΩ (100 channels), to 10 MΩ (1000 channels), and to 1. 0 MΩ (10, 000 channels). Velocity of propagation (θ, in cm/sec) was calculated from the measured total propagation time (TPT, the time difference between when the AP rising phase of the first cell and the last cell crossed - 20 mV), assuming a constant cell length of 200 μm. When there were no gj-channels, or only one, the transmission of excitation between cells was produced by the electric field (EF), i. e., the negative junctional cleft potential, that is generated in the narrow junctional clefts (e. g., 100 A) when the prejunctional membrane fires an AP (a fraction of a millisecond before the adjacent surface membrane). There were significant end-effects at the termination of the strand, such that the last cell (cell # 10) failed to fire, or fired after a prolonged delay. This end-effect was abolished when the strand <b>termination</b> <b>resistance</b> (R bt) was increased from 1. 0 KΩ to 600 MΩ. When there were 1000 or 10, 000 gj-channels, the transmission of excitation was produced by local-circuit current flow from one cell to the next through the gj-channels.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effect of}} depth on {{propagation}} velocity within {{a bundle of}} cardiac muscle fibers {{is likely to be}} an important factor in the genesis of some heart arrhythmias. Model and methods The velocity profile of simulated action potentials propagated down a bundle of parallel cardiac muscle fibers was examined in a cross-section of the bundle using a PSpice model. The model (20 × 10) consisted of 20 chains in parallel, each chain being 10 cells in length. All 20 chains were stimulated simultaneously at the left end of the bundle using rectangular current pulses (0. 25 nA, 0. 25 ms duration) applied intracellularly. The simulated bundle was symmetrical at the top and bottom (including two grounds), and voltage markers were placed intracellularly only in cells 1, 5 and 10 of each chain to limit the total number of traces to 60. All electrical parameters were standard values; the variables were (1) the number of longitudinal gap-junction (G-j) channels (0, 1, 10, 100), (2) the longitudinal resistance between the parallel chains (R ol 2) (reflecting the closeness of the packing of the chains), and (3) the bundle <b>termination</b> <b>resistance</b> at the two ends of the bundle (R BT). The standard values for R ol 2 and R BT were 200 KΩ. Results The velocity profile was bell-shaped when there was 0 or only 1 gj-channel. With standard R ol 2 and R BT values, the velocity at the surface of the bundle (θ 1 and θ 20) was more than double (2. 15 ×) that {{at the core of the}} bundle (θ 10, θ 11). This surface:core ratio of velocities was dependent on the values of R ol 2 and R BT. When R ol 2 was lowered 10 -fold, θ 1 increased slightly and θ 2 decreased slightly. When there were 100 gj-channels, the velocity profile was flat, i. e. the velocity at the core was about the same as that at the surface. Both velocities were more than 10 -fold higher than in the absence of gj-channels. Varying R ol 2 and R BT had almost no effect. When there were 10 gj-channels, the cross-sectional velocity profile was bullet-shaped, but with a low surface/core ratio, with standard R ol 2 and R BT values. Conclusion When there were no or few gj-channels (0 or 1), the profile was bell-shaped with the core velocity less than half that at the surface. In contrast, when there were many gj-channels (100), the profile was flat. Therefore, when some gj-channels close under pathophysiological conditions, this marked velocity profile could contribute to the genesis of arrhythmias. </p...|$|E
