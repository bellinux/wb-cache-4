[...] While the Mexican Football Association did not object, they deferred to FIFA headquarters in Zurich for an official ruling. FIFA ruled against mixed-sex football teams stating, [...] "There must be a clear separation between men's and women's football." [...] Furthermore, a ban was placed on Domínguez for playing in an exhibition game outside the league but still alongside men. [...] "I just wanted to be given the chance to try," [...] Domínguez said. [...] "If I failed I would have been the first to say I can't do it, the first to admit it doesn't work.

Mr. Irwine didn't go into those things--he preached short moral sermons, and that was all. But then he acted pretty much up to what he said; he didn't set up for being so different from other folks one day, and then be as like 'em as two peas the next. And he made folks love him and respect him, and that was better nor stirring up their gall wi' being overbusy. Mrs. Poyser used to say--you know she would have her word about everything--she said, Mr. Irwine was like a good meal o' victual, you were the better for him without thinking on it, and Mr. Ryde was like a dose o' physic, he gripped you and worreted you, and after all he left you much the same." ...|$|E
