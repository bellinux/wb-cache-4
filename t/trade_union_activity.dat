25|$|As {{with the}} right of freedom of assembly, there has not {{traditionally}} been positive protection {{of the right of}} freedom of association. The common law has recognised the autonomy of organisations in deciding their membership and legislation has not placed any general controls on the exercise of the right of association. The right is generally reflected in the principle of freedom of contract and the relative ease by which companies and trusts can be set up. The right is most regulated in the area of labour relations including the right to join a trade union which achieved statutory recognition in the Industrial Relations Act 1971, the right not to be dismissed or refused employment on the basis of non-membership under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 and the right to claim unfair dismissal on the basis of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>activity.</b> However, there is no obligation on employers to recognise collective bargaining agreements except in certain very limited circumstances and their role has declined significantly. The right to strike was acknowledged {{for the first time in}} March 2011 by the Court of Appeal. The right not to be unjustly excluded from the exercise of a trade or profession has been recognised by the courts, in a case brought by female horse trainer Florence Nagle against the Jockey Club's refusal to grant her a training licence on grounds of her sex.|$|E

500|$|Wilberforce {{was deeply}} {{conservative}} {{when it came}} to challenges to the existing political and social order. He advocated change in society through Christianity and improvement in morals, education and religion, fearing and opposing radical causes and revolution. The radical [...] writer William Cobbett was among those who attacked what they saw as Wilberforce's hypocrisy in campaigning for better working conditions for slaves while British workers lived in terrible conditions at home. [...] "Never have you done one single act, in favour of the labourers of this country", he wrote. Critics noted Wilberforce's support of the suspension of habeas corpus in 1795 and his votes for Pitt's [...] "Gagging Bills", which banned meetings of more than 50people, allowing speakers to be arrested and imposing harsh penalties on those who attacked the constitution. Wilberforce was opposed to giving workers' rights to organise into unions, in 1799 speaking in favour of the Combination Act, which suppressed <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>activity</b> throughout the United Kingdom, and calling unions [...] "a general disease in our society". He also opposed an enquiry into the 1819 Peterloo Massacre in which eleven protesters were killed at a political rally demanding reform. Concerned about [...] "bad men who wished to produce anarchy and confusion", he approved of the government's Six Acts, which further limited public meetings and seditious writings. Wilberforce's actions led the essayist William Hazlitt to condemn him as one [...] "who preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages, and tolerates its worst abuses in civilised states." ...|$|E

[...] It was the only general strike in British history, as union leaders such as Ernest Bevin, who had coordinated the strike, considered it a mistake. They decided that action by political parties was a better solution. [...] However, the country came close to a one-day general strike on 31 July 1972. over the imprisonment of the Pentonville Five.|$|E

The suit alleged that Coca-Cola was indirectly responsible for having [...] "contracted with or otherwise directed paramilitary security forces that utilized extreme violence and murdered, tortured, unlawfully detained or otherwise silenced trade union leaders". This sparked campaigns to boycott Coca-Cola in the UK, US, Germany, Italy, and Australia.

It also made adjustments to a workforce's ability to legally go on strike, enabling workers to bargain for conditions without collectivised representation, and significantly restricting <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{period between}} 1815 and 1871 saw revolutionary {{attempts}} {{in much of}} Europe (apart from Britain). They all failed however. As industrial work forces grew in Western Europe, socialism and <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>activity</b> developed. The last vestiges of serfdom were abolished in Russia in 1861. [...] Greece and the other Balkan nations began a long slow road to independence from the Ottoman Empire, starting in the 1820s. Italy was unified in its Risorgimento in 1860. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870â€“71, Otto von Bismarck unified the German states into an empire that was politically and militarily dominant until 1914. Most of Europe scramble for imperial colonies in Africa and Asia in the Age of Empire. Britain and France built the largest empires, while diplomats ensured there were no major wars in Europe, apart from the Crimean War of the 1850s.|$|E
