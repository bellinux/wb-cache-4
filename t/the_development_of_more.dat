5|$|The eyes of tadpoles lack lids, but at metamorphosis, {{the cornea}} becomes more dome-shaped, the lens becomes flatter, and eyelids and {{associated}} glands and ducts develop. The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were {{a first step}} in <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> advanced vertebrate eyes. They allow colour vision and depth of focus. In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive {{to a wide range of}} wavelengths.|$|E

5|$|World WarII led to {{significant}} changes to Australian society. Economically, the war accelerated <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> Australia's manufacturing industry {{and led to}} a large fall in unemployment. The impact of World WarII changed Australian society, and contributed to <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> a <b>more</b> cosmopolitan society in which women were able to play a larger role. The war also resulted in a greater maturity in Australia's approach to international affairs, as demonstrated by <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> a <b>more</b> independent foreign policy and the encouragement of mass immigration after the war.|$|R

5|$|The {{molluscan}} shell {{appears to}} have originated from a mucus coating, which eventually stiffened into a cuticle. This would have been impermeable and thus forced <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> sophisticated respiratory apparatus {{in the form of}} gills. Eventually, the cuticle would have become mineralized, using the same genetic machinery (engrailed) as most other bilaterian skeletons. The first mollusc shell almost certainly was reinforced with the mineral aragonite.|$|E
5|$|World WarII {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a long period of Australian economic growth. The war greatly increased the size and importance of the Australian manufacturing sector and stimulated <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> technologically advanced industries. As part of this trend many workers acquired relatively high skill levels and female labour force participation rates greatly increased. Many women were forced out of traditionally male-dominated industries after the war, however.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s {{and early}} 1940s, the Navy divided carrier-borne bombers into two types: the torpedo bomber and the dive bomber, each with crews {{of two or}} three men. Wartime {{experience}} showed that pilots could aim bombs and torpedoes without assistance from other crewmembers as well as navigate with the aid of radio beacons and <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> powerful engines meant that faster aircraft no longer needed a rear gunner for self-defense. Furthermore, the consolidation of the two types of bombers greatly increased the flexibility of a carrier's air group and allowed the number of fighters in an air group to be increased.|$|E

50|$|Homasote {{was also}} widely used as wall {{sheeting}} from the 40's into the 70's, however due to <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> fire resistant gypsum board it has decreased in popularity as a wall sheeting.|$|R
30|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> a <b>more</b> robust CIS access anomaly {{detection}} model, {{there are several}} {{limitations of the study}} that we wish to point out to serve as a guidebook for future research on this topic.|$|R
5|$|The G {{class were}} ordered {{as part of}} the 1933 Naval Construction Programme, the H class {{following}} in 1934. These ships were based on the preceding F class, but the elimination of cruising turbines and <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> compact machinery allowed their dimensions and displacement to be slightly reduced. The H class were repeats of the G's with some minor differences. All of the destroyers were fitted with ASDIC (sonar) and the ability to use the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> {{advanced}} {{electronic systems}} in the 1980s allowed manufacturers to produce snow groomers which could work on and replicate a much wider range of terrains, with the most modern even able to produce half-pipes and ramps for snowboarding. Snow groomers are also {{used in conjunction with}} snow cannons, to ensure that the snow produced is spread evenly across the resort. However, snow groomers have a detrimental effect on the environment within the resort. Regular pressure from the grooming vehicle increases the infiltration rate of the soil while decreasing the field capacity. This increases the rate at which water can soak through the soil, making it more prone to erosion.|$|E
5|$|The routing from Brawley to Calipatria {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1933; {{following}} the completion of the road from Yuma to San Diego, increased tourism and growth led to <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> highways in Imperial County, and the construction of the system was expected to aid in future growth, according to the Los Angeles Times. The northern section above SR 78 was legislatively defined as Route 187; the part of the highway south of Route 187 was defined as Route 201.|$|E

5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 18th century, Felling {{consisted}} of little more than the large Brandling estate and a small scattering of tiny farming villages. However, Ralph Brandling, the incumbent of the Brandling estate at that time, had come to realise the value of the rich coal deposits on his estate and began drift mining around 1670. He initially found the large coal seams under his estate difficult to extract due to their depth, and indeed it was imported coal from Newcastle-upon-Tyne which saw <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> extensive industries in salt, glass and chemicals which began to attract workers to the area. At around 1750, a large copper-works was opened at the banks of the River Tyne; the first such works to be developed on the river. Encouraged by these developments, Ralph Brandling's son, Charles Brandling, firstly commissioned more extensive mining of near-surface coal on his estate and then, encouraged by the discovery of several strata below his estate, began boring operations in 1758 to allow ultimately for deeper coal extraction. The result was the opening of Felling Colliery in 1779, working on the High Main stratum at a depth of 125 fathoms. A brown paper mill was also opened in 1798.|$|E
5|$|There {{are almost}} no written sources {{from which to}} {{reconstruct}} the demography of early medieval Scotland. Estimates have been made of a population of 10,000 in Dál Riata and 80–100,000 for Pictland, which was probably the largest region. It {{is likely that the}} fifth and sixth centuries saw higher mortality rates due to the appearance of bubonic plague, which may have reduced the population. The examination of burial sites for this period, such as that at Hallowhill, St Andrews, indicates a life expectancy of only 26 to 29. The known conditions have been taken to suggest it was a high fertility, high mortality society, similar to developing countries in the modern world, with a relatively young demographic profile, and perhaps early childbearing, and large numbers of children born to each woman (although with high child mortality). This would have meant a relatively low ratio of available workers to the number of mouths to feed, which in turn would have made it difficult to produce a surplus that would allow demographic growth and <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> complex societies.|$|E
5|$|The first Fire Emblem title, Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, was {{originally}} never {{intended as a}} commercial game, defined by creator Shouzou Kaga as a dōjin project with three other job-holding students. As it turned out, the game was successful, prompting <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> games in the series. The game was developed at Intelligent Systems, whose previous notable game was the strategy game Famicom Wars. Kaga would work on the Fire Emblem series until Thracia 776, when he left Nintendo and began development on Tear Ring Saga for the PlayStation. After Thracia 776, the Fire Emblem series had several releases on portable devices. At this time, Marth and Roy from Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and Sword of Seals appeared as playable characters in Super Smash Bros. Melee, prompting western interest in the Fire Emblem series. The positive reception of the characters made Nintendo decide to localize Blazing Sword under the title Fire Emblem. Due to its overseas success, {{it was decided to}} return the series to home consoles for Path of Radiance for the GameCube. Despite it arriving late in the GameCube's life cycle, it provided a late boost to sales, reaffirming Nintendo's faith in the series. By 2010, the series was suffering from declining sales and Nintendo told Intelligent Systems that if their next Fire Emblem failed to sell above 250,000 units, the series would be cancelled. This prompted Intelligent Systems to include lots of features new to the series, intending to make it the culmination of the series. The game's reception and sales ended up saving the series from cancellation, convincing Nintendo to continue production.|$|E
