5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> and lower halves of the tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor kitchen to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> floors, holding the records, was removed, and a window on the first floor was turned into a doorway so that <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the first floor, possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E
5|$|Car types include coaches, dining cars, lounges, and {{sleeping}} cars. Most passenger spaces are on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> level, {{which features a}} row of windows on both sides.

5|$|Crimea's coastal highway {{runs through}} the park, {{dividing}} it into <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> and lower portions. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> park {{is dominated by the}} mountain springs, {{as well as by the}} native southern coast forestry and clusters of foreign tree growth. A feature of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> park is the Fountain of Trilby, which was placed there in 1829. The lower park is modelled upon a style called the Italian Renaissance garden. It features three pairs of Medici lions near the staircase leading up to the palace's southern façade, carved out of carrara marble by sculptor Giovanni Bonnani.|$|E

5|$|Heterodontosaurus {{is known}} from fossils found in {{formations}} of the Karoo Supergroup, including <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> Elliot Formation and the Clarens Formation, which {{date to the}} Hettangian and Sinemurian ages of the Lower Jurassic, around 200-190million years ago. Originally, Heterodontosaurus {{was thought to be}} from <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> Triassic period. <b>The</b> <b>Upper</b> Elliot Formation consists of red/purple mudstone and red/white sandstone, whereas the slightly younger Clarens Formation consists of white/cream-coloured sandstone. The Clarens Formation is less rich in fossils than <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> Elliot Formation; its sediments also often form cliffs, restricting accessibility for fossil hunters. <b>The</b> <b>Upper</b> Elliot Formation is characterised by animals that appear to be more lightly built than those of the Lower Elliot Formation, which may have been an adaptation to the drier climate at this time in southern Africa. Both formations are famous for their abundant vertebrate fossils, including temnospondyl amphibians, turtles, lepidosaurs, aetosaurs, crocodylomorphs, and non-mammal cynodonts.|$|E

5|$|In {{another example}} of {{evolution}} of culture, Durkheim pointed to fashion, although in this case he noted a more cyclical phenomenon. According to Durkheim, fashion serves to differentiate between lower classes and upper classes, but because lower classes {{want to look like}} <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> classes, they will eventually adapt <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> class fashion, depreciating it, and forcing <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> class to adopt a new fashion.|$|E

5|$|The {{grey reef shark}} has a streamlined, {{moderately}} stout {{body with}} a long, blunt snout and large, round eyes. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> and lower jaws each have 13 or 14 teeth (usually 14 in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> and 13 in the lower). <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> teeth are triangular with slanted cusps, while the bottom teeth have narrower, erect cusps. The tooth serrations are larger in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> jaw than in the lower. The first dorsal fin is medium-sized, {{and there is no}} ridge running between it and the second dorsal fin. The pectoral fins are narrow and falcate (sickle-shaped).|$|E
5|$|The jaws {{contained}} {{sharp teeth}} which were compressed laterally and unequal {{in size and}} shape, and this variation of tooth shape is known as heterodonty. The teeth on the premaxillae (bones at the very tip of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> jaw) were slender, unlike those of the maxillae (the main tooth-bearing bones in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> jaw) which had a straight posterior edge. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> jaw bore 30 teeth, with each premaxilla carrying about 4 teeth and each maxilla 11, while the lower jaw held 22 teeth.|$|E

5|$|Apatosaurus was {{the second}} most common sauropod in the Morrison Formation ecosystem, after Camarasaurus. Apatosaurus may have been more solitary than other Morrison Formation dinosaurs.
