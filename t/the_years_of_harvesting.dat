40|$|Emissions of {{greenhouse}} gases is accounted for and reported annually under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto protocol. In the current accounting system, emissions of CO 2 from harvested wood products (HWP) are attributed to <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> and <b>the</b> country <b>of</b> <b>harvest.</b> All harvested wood is thus assumed to be oxidised to CO 2 in <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvesting,</b> and no wood goes into long term storage. This is called the IPCC default approach. Much <b>of</b> the <b>harvested</b> wood will however be stored for a short or {{long period of time}} before it oxidises and this will cause a delayed emission of CO 2.

40|$|International audienceAbstractForeknowledge about {{sugarcane}} crop size {{can help}} industry members make more informed decisions. There exists many {{different combinations of}} climate variables, seasonal climate prediction indices, and crop model outputs that could prove useful in explaining sugarcane crop size. A data mining method like random forests can cope with generating a prediction model when the search space of predictor variables is large. Research that has investigated the accuracy of random forests to explain annual variation in sugarcane productivity and the suitability of predictor variables generated from crop models coupled with observed climate and seasonal climate prediction indices is limited. Simulated biomass from the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) sugarcane crop model, seasonal climate prediction indices and observed rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature, and radiation were supplied as inputs to a random forest classifier and a random forest regression model to explain annual variation in regional sugarcane yields at Tully, in northeastern Australia. Prediction models were generated on 1 September in <b>the</b> <b>year</b> before harvest, and then on 1 January and 1 March in <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest,</b> which typically runs from June to November. Our results indicated that in 86. 36  % <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> {{it was possible to}} determine as early as September in <b>the</b> <b>year</b> before harvest if production would be above the median. This accuracy improved to 95. 45  % by January in <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest.</b> <b>The</b> R-squared <b>of</b> the random forest regression model gradually improved from 66. 76 to 79. 21  % from September in <b>the</b> <b>year</b> before harvest through to March in <b>the</b> same <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest.</b> All three sets of variables—(i) simulated biomass indices, (ii) observed climate, and (iii) seasonal climate prediction indices—were typically featured in the models at various stages.

Between 2008 and 2012, the leaching of nitrate (NO 3 −) was monitored with self-integrating accumulators over 6 -month periods and the emissions of the greenhouse gases (GHG) nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) were determined in closed gas chambers. During <b>the</b> first 4 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poplar SRC, most nitrogen was lost through NO 3 − leaching from the main root zone; however, there was no significant relationship to the rate of N fertilisation.

40|$|Group {{selection}} silvicultural {{systems have}} been recommended for managing mountain caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) habitat in high elevation Engelmann spruce &ndash; subalpine fir forests in east-central British Columbia. We measured the response of arboreal lichen (a key winter forage) to <b>harvesting</b> <b>of</b> 30 % of the forested area using three partial cutting treatments, which created small (0. 03 ha), medium (0. 13 ha), and large (1. 0 ha) openings, and a no-harvest treatment. Treatments were replicated on four sites, and monitored over a ten <b>year</b> post-harvest period. <b>The</b> short-term loss of lichen associated with removal of approximately {{one third of the}} trees was partially offset by a significant (P= 0. 01) increase in lichen abundance on trees in the caribou feeding zone (up to 4. 5 m) in the three partial cutting treatments relative to trees in the uncut forest. Differences among treatments in the change in lichen composition, as measured by the percentage of Alectoria sarmentosa and Bryoria spp., were marginally significant (P= 0. 10). The partial cutting treatments showing a greater likelihood of shifting towards more Bryoria spp. than no-harvest treatment (P= 0. 04). In <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> (1993), larger trees were found to hold more lichen than smaller trees (P= 0. 04), and live trees supported more lichen than dead trees (P= 0. 01), but lichen loading was similar among tree species (P= 0. 51). Tree fall rates were similar among treatments, based on <b>the</b> ten <b>year</b> average (0. 6 &ndash; 0. 8 % of sample trees per <b>year).</b> <b>The</b> results indicate that caribou foraging habitat is maintained in the residual forest when group selection systems that remove only 30 % of the trees are applied. Information on the distribution of lichen is useful for developing stand level prescriptions. Providing lichen bearing habitat meets just one of the needs of caribou. A comprehensive approach that considers all factors and their interactions is essential to maintain and recover the threatened mountain caribou...|$|R
50|$|Because breadfruit trees usually produce large crops {{at certain}} times <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> {{preservation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>harvested</b> fruit is an issue. One traditional preservation technique is to bury peeled and washed fruits in a leaf-lined pit where they ferment over several weeks and produce a sour, sticky paste. So stored, the product may last a year or more, and some pits are reported to have produced edible contents more than 20 years later. Fermented breadfruit mash goes by many names such as mahr, ma, masi, furo, and bwiru, among others.|$|R
40|$|The {{yield of}} sugar beet is {{directly}} affected by LAI (leaf area index) and values of LAD (leaf area duration). The integral leaf area plays, except for other factors, an important role during the damage or reduction of leaf apparatus. There are many sources of leaf damage: natural disasters (hailstorm), diseases, pests (including game browsing) etc. The intensity of the root production and quality differs {{in relation to the}} growth stage of the damage plant. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the extent of losses in the root yield and the quality of sugar beet upon gradual reduction of the leaf area. Two diploid varieties Monza and Compact were used in the small-plot trials conducted in years 2004 to 2006 (in the experimental station Žabčice – maize production region, zone K 2, average altitude 184 m, soil type was classified as gley fluvisoil, soil is medium heavy to heavy, clay-loam to loam type). The leaf area was manually reduced by 25 % and 50 % at BBCH 18 – 19 growth phase (8 – 9 leaves unfolded). The results were statistically evaluated by analysis of variance and testing by Tukey test (at the significance level α = 5 %). Reduction of the leaf area was reflected on the decrease of the root yield by 1 to 10 % depending on <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> stressful state of the plants after defoliation resulted in the decrease of the yield of polarization sugar per hectare, namely by 0. 45 to 1. 66 t. ha– 1. In 2005, the leaf area reduction caused a rise of the α-amino nitrogen content. The rise in the potassium and sodium cations content caused by the leaf area reduction also increased the sugar content in the treacle (by 0. 1 to 0. 16 %). The increasing leaf area reduction lead to decreasing of yield of polarization sugar. However, this descent was statistically significant in harvest year 2006 only...|$|R
