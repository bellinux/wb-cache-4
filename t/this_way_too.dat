During the Stalin {{era in the}} 1930s and 1940s, a common labourer could expect promotion to a white-collar job if he studied and obeyed Soviet authorities. In Brezhnev's Soviet Union {{this was not the}} case. Holders of attractive positions clung to them as long as possible; mere incompetence was not seen as a good reason to dismiss anyone. In <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>too,</b> the Soviet society Brezhnev passed on had become static.|$|E

'Why don't we just do this? During the course of the match, let's have a spot where Shawn puts Bret in his own hold - the Sharpshooter. As soon as Shawn clamps it on, have the referee call for the bell as if Bret quit...'". Jim Cornette, in his 2010 YouShoot Shoot Interview, refutes Russo's claims of originating the screwjob, stating that Russo {{was not part of the}} meetings planning the screwjob at any time, appeared totally oblivious as to what had occurred while watching the event on a television backstage, and had to have the entire concept of a 'screwjob' explained to him. Cornette also admitted to have suggested Vince and creative to have Ken Shamrock [...] "double-cross" [...] Hart for the title as Hart was reportedly willing to drop the belt to anyone except Michaels, therefore unwittingly introducing the concept of a screwjob to McMahon & co.|$|E

The United States ambassador to the United Kingdom, Walter Hines Page, wrote [...] "The submarines are sinking freight ships faster than freight ships are being built by the whole world. In <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>too,</b> then, the Germans are succeeding. Now if this goes on long enough, the Allies' game is up. For instance, they have lately sunk so many fuel oil ships, that this country may very soon be in a perilous condition — even the Grand Fleet may not have enough fuel". Georges Clemenceau wrote to US president Wilson [...] "Gasoline is as vital as blood in the coming battles…a failure in the supply of gasoline would cause the immediate paralysis of our armies". Wilson reacted strongly. The War Shipping Board commandeered all ships in the United States and also took over all yards. An unprecedented budget of $US1.3 billion was used for this end. At Hog Island, the largest shipyard {{in the world was}} built, known for the Hog Islander.|$|E

6000|$|To Magdalen {{it was a}} {{delightful}} view, and delightful too had been the arranging of her house, and preparing for her sisters. All the furniture and contents of the abode had been left to her. It was solid and handsome of its kind, belonging {{to the days of}} the retired Q.C., and some of it would have been displaced for what was more fresh and tasteful if Magdalen had not consulted economy. So she depended on basket-chairs, screens, brackets and drapery to enliven the ancient mahagony and rosewood, and she had accumulated a good many water colours, vases and knick-knacks. The old grand piano was found to be past its work, so that she went the length of purchasing a cottage one for the drawing-room, and another for the sitting-room that was to be the girls' own property, and on which she expended much care and contrivance. It opened into the drawing-room, and like it, had glass doors into the verandah, as well as another door into the little hall. The drawing-room had a bow window looking over the fields towards the South, and <b>this</b> <b>way</b> <b>too</b> looked the dining-room, in which Magdalen bestowed whatever was least interesting, such as the [...] "Hume and Smollett" [...] and [...] "Gibbon" [...] of her grandfather's library and her own school books, from which she hoped to teach Thekla.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was one of}} {{the young}} ladies in the costume-room who first showed by her manner that he was a visible object and capable of {{exciting}} interest. She talked to him, she encouraged him to talk to her, she lent him a book she possessed, and darned a sock for him, and said she would be his elder sister. She allowed him to escort her to church with a great air of having induced him to go. Then she investigated his eternal welfare, overcame a certain affectation of virile indifference to religion, and extorted a promise that he would undergo [...] "confirmation." [...] This excited the other young lady in the costumes, her natural rival, and she set herself with great charm and subtlety to the capture of the ripening heart of Kipps. She took a more worldly line. She went for a walk with him to the pier on Sunday afternoon, and explained to him how a gentleman must always walk [...] "outside" [...] a lady on a pavement, and how all gentlemen wore, or at least carried gloves, and generally the broad beginnings of the British social ideal. Afterwards the ladies exchanged [...] "words," [...] upon Sabbatical grounds. In this way was the toga virilis bestowed on Kipps, and he became recognised as a suitable object for that Platonic Eros whose blunted darts devastate even the very highest-class establishments. In <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>too,</b> did that pervading ambition of the British young man to be, if not a [...] "gentleman," [...] at least mistakably like one, take root in his heart.|$|E

Above all earthly things I dread their driving me to do it. How much do I hold in, and wink at; raging and shuddering in my own secret mind, and not outwardly at all!" [...] He would boast to me at other times: [...] "This and that I have seen, this and that I have heard; yet patiently stood it." [...] He had <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>too,</b> which I have never seen in any other man, that he affectionately loved many persons to whom he never or hardly ever showed a countenance of love. Once on my venturing to expostulate with him on the subject, he reminded me of Solomon: [...] "Many sons I have; it is not fit that I should smile on them." [...] He would suffer faults, damage from his servants, and know what he suffered, and not speak of it; but I think the reason was, he waited a good time for speaking of it, and in a wise way amending it. He intimated, openly in chapter to us all, that he would have no eavesdropping: [...] "Let none," [...] said he, [...] "come to me secretly accusing another, unless he will publicly stand to the same; if he come otherwise, I will openly proclaim the name of him. I wish, too, that every Monk of you have free access to me, to speak of your needs or grievances when you will." ...|$|E

50|$|Because methane on Mars {{would quickly}} break down due to {{ultraviolet}} {{radiation from the}} Sun and chemical reactions with other gases, its reported persistent presence in the atmosphere also implies {{the existence of a}} source to continually replenish the gas.
