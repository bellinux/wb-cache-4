5|$|All seven PCI Express x16 {{slots in}} the Asus P6T7 {{motherboard}} {{were used in}} the building of the Fastra II computer. However, the video cards in the Fastra II are wide enough to require two such slots each. <b>To</b> <b>solve</b> <b>this</b> issue, the researchers came up with flexible PCI Express cables, and Tones developed a custom cage which allowed the video cards to suspend over the motherboard.|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable. It is not possible to know where the player's character {{is going to be in}} the next few seconds; therefore, it is not possible to plan the shots as a film maker would do. <b>To</b> <b>solve</b> <b>this</b> issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>solve</b> <b>this</b> problem, {{the device}} {{keeps track of}} the type of DATAx packet it last accepted. If it {{receives}} another DATAx packet of the same type, it is acknowledged but ignored as a duplicate. Only a DATAx packet of the opposite type is actually received.|$|E
5|$|In New Guinea, {{a country}} without roads, {{large-scale}} transportation {{of men and}} materiel {{would have to be}} accomplished by aircraft or ships. A multi-pronged approach was employed <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>this</b> problem. Disassembled landing craft were shipped to Australia, where they were assembled in Cairns. The range of these small landing craft was to be greatly extended by the landing ships of the VII Amphibious Force, which began arriving in late 1942, and formed part of the newly formed Seventh Fleet. Since the Seventh Fleet had no aircraft carriers, the range of naval operations was limited by that of the fighter aircraft of the Fifth Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Over time, as Rome's empire grew, the two annual consuls {{ceased to}} be enough to command its many armies in the field or {{administer}} its many provinces. <b>To</b> <b>solve</b> <b>this</b> problem, it became normal to prorogue the authority of current consuls and praetors beyond their normal terms so they could continue to command in the field. Over time, however, with increasing need for competent generals and administrators, prorogation of magistrates became the norm; and the device was used, increasingly by the assemblies, to grant imperium to popular politicians.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>solving</b> <b>this</b> {{problem with}} a very short and readable program, SequenceL’s evaluation of the nested sequences would all be performed in parallel.|$|R
50|$|A {{standard}} approach <b>to</b> <b>solving</b> <b>this</b> is <b>to</b> use iteration, amounting to the resolvent formalism; written as a series, {{the solution is}} known as the Liouville-Neumann series.|$|R
50|$|Another similar {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>solving</b> <b>this</b> cube is <b>to</b> first pair the edges, {{and then the}} centers. This, too, is vulnerable to the parity errors described above.|$|R
5|$|Preliminary {{scouting}} {{was well}} underway {{by the time}} Fargo was renewed. Principal photography began in Calgary, Alberta on January 19, 2015, and took 85 days. The city's central business district and Kensington neighborhood doubled for Kansas City, Sioux Falls, and Luverne. Production crew constructed the Waffle Hut set on the CL Ranch in neighboring Springbank. Elsewhere in the area, shooting took place in Didsbury, High River, and Fort Macleod. Initially, the weather posed a challenge for the production {{because it was too}} warm for snow. <b>To</b> <b>solve</b> <b>this</b> problem, the production crew brought snow to the set from nearby mountains.|$|E
5|$|The Type 42 destroyers (also {{known as}} the Sheffield class) were made in three batches; Cardiff {{was built in the}} first. She cost over £30million, which was double her {{original}} quoted price. Her keel was laid down on 6 November 1972, at Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The build was interrupted by a labour shortage at Vickers. <b>To</b> <b>solve</b> <b>this</b> problem, she was towed to Swan Hunter Hawthorn Leslie yard in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear and completed there.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} timescale {{of giant}} planets {{is also an}} important problem. Old theories were unable to explain how their cores could form fast enough to accumulate significant amounts of gas from the quickly disappearing protoplanetary disk. The mean lifetime of the disks, which is less than ten million (107)years, appeared to be shorter than the time necessary for the core formation. Much progress has been done <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>this</b> problem and current models of giant planet formation are now capable of forming Jupiter (or more massive planets) in about 4 million years or less, well within the average lifetime of gaseous disks.|$|E

25|$|In early MEMS {{resonator}} development, researchers {{tried to}} build resonators at the target application frequencies and to maintain those frequencies over temperature. Approaches <b>to</b> <b>solving</b> <b>this</b> problem included trimming and temperature compensating the MEMS resonators in ways analogous to those used for quartz crystal.|$|R
5|$|The {{maiden flight}} of the unarmed prototype, piloted by M. M. Gromov and without the ATsN installation, {{occurred}} at Khodynka Aerodrome on 27 December 1936. After successful initial trials, the ATsN system was installed for the State acceptance trials in August 1937 and the AM-34RNB engines were fitted during the tests. Gromov reported that the rudder was ineffective and that the outer engines overheated. Subsequent wind tunnel testing identified {{a problem with the}} aerodynamics of the radiators and nacelles. <b>To</b> <b>solve</b> <b>this</b> problem, the outer engines' radiators were moved into deep ducts under the inner nacelles and the rudder was enlarged and redesigned with a smooth skin.|$|E
5|$|The band {{aimed for}} a tribal sound but {{encountered}} problems including minuscule timing errors; during this period, they refined their percussive sound by experimenting with erecting walls {{to isolate the}} drums and rearranging parts. In February 1996, during the mixing process, guitarist Donnie Steele {{decided to leave the}} band for religious reasons and as a result, Craig Jones joined the band to fill the spot; however, the band realized that they were incorporating too many samples on their recordings and could not reproduce these sounds live. <b>To</b> <b>solve</b> <b>this</b> problem, Jones moved to full-time sampler and Mick Thomson joined as a guitarist. Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. was released on October 31, 1996 with a release party at The Safari, a local club where the band played many of their earliest gigs.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} use of Christian symbolism led to questions about how to produce memorials suitable for non-Christians. Lutyens attempted <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>this</b> problem for the IWGC through {{the design of the}} Stone of Remembrance, or War Stone. This was a large, simple stone, intended to resemble an altar and evoke the theme of sacrifice. In practice, many commentators felt it resembled a sarcophagus. Lutyens wanted it to avoid conventional Christian symbolism and based it on designs in Chinese Ming tombs. One of Lutyens' arguments in favour of his design was that explicit Christian symbolism excluded the Indian and Jewish communities and atheists. The IWGC designs for the Indian and Chinese war cemeteries in Europe deliberately did not use Christian imagery – although, as historian Xu Guoqi notes, the Chinese role in the Allied armies remains largely uncommemorated through memorials.|$|E
