2500|$|Skiers in {{this class}} may injure {{themselves}} while skiing. Between 1994 to 2006, the German national para-Alpine skiing team had four skiers in LW2 who had an injury while skiing. One injury occurred in 1996 and was an [...] "injury of the Plexus brachialis." [...] In 1998 at the Winter Paralympics, LW2 skier, Alexander Spitz, broke his leg in the downhill event. In 2000, a skier had a [...] "distorsion of the plexus brachialis and anterior luxation of the shoulder". [...] In 2001, a skier had a [...] "fracture shoulder <b>tuberculum</b> <b>majus</b> and anterior luxation". This class has {{a higher rate of}} [...] "plexus brachialis distorsion and a higher rate of shoulder injuries" [...] compared to able bodied skiers.|$|E
40|$|In this study, one wombat (Lasiorhinus latifornis) {{was used}} to {{describe}} the bones of the thoracic limb. It was observed that the fossa supraspinata was nearly equal to the fossa infraspinata. The Processus hamatus and processus suprahamatus were present and processus coracoideus was well developed. <b>Tuberculum</b> <b>majus</b> was divided into cranial and caudal parts. A proximally directed pointed process arising from the caudal border line of the humerus was described as well as a supracondylar foramen. The radius and ulna are separated bones with well-developed lateral and medial processus styloideus. Four proximal and two distal ossa carpi and five metacarpals were determined. The results were discussed with other domestic and wild mammals and supported with 10 images...|$|E
40|$|Biodegradable {{implants}} lead {{to problems}} such as cyst formation, soft-tissue inflammation, loose implant fragments or local osteolysis. This report represents the first published case of an intraosseous foreign body granuloma in the humeral head after arthroscopic rotator cuff tear fixation with a poly-l-lactide (PLLA) suture anchor. A 48 -year-old female patient presented with pain in her right shoulder. A refixation of her right supraspinatus tendon with a biodegradable suture anchor was performed 11 Â months ago at an external hospital. Laboratory tests showed normal values for C-reactive protein, leukocytes and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. No signs of infection or instability were noted. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was 8, the simple shoulder test (SST) was 4 and the American shoulder and elbow surgeons score (ASES) was 44. Plain radiographs showed high lucency {{in the area of}} the <b>tuberculum</b> <b>majus.</b> MRI showed an intra- and extraosseous mass surrounded by fluid in this area. Surgical care involved arthroscopic debridement and removal of the suture anchor. Histological examination revealed a foreign body granuloma. At the 18 -month follow-up the patient was nearly pain-free. The VAS was 2, SST was 10 and ASES was 88. Foreign body granulomas are a well known but rarely described complication that arises after the use of biodegradable suture anchors in shoulder surgery. Every patient presenting with shoulder pain after usage of a biodegradable fixation material should be evaluated closely. Orthopaedic surgeons should be aware of the possibility of delayed foreign body reactions, especially after using PLLA anchors...|$|E
40|$|In illegal hunting it {{is often}} {{possible}} only {{on the basis of}} morphological characteristics to determine the animal species. By the method of comparison there was performed the forensic analysis of roe deer and sheep osteological features. For the purpose of investigating the shoulder blade (Scapula) and shoulder bone (Humerus) comparative characteristics, there were used 6 shoulder blades and 6 shoulder bones of roe deer and 8 shoulder blades and 8 shoulder bones of sheep. After the skin, muscles, arterial, venous and lymphatic vessels as well as nerves were removed from the bones, they were thermally treated in an autoclave. Subsequently, the bones were placed in 3 % solutioin of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) for bleaching and degreasing. Then they were air dried and then photographed. Shoulder blade (Scapula) is a bone plate (Ossa plana) roughly triangular in shape. Scapular spine (Spina scapulae) is much more prominent in roe deer with acromion blade in the form of spike, while in sheep it is shorter and ends with acrimion at a right angle. Shoulder blade cup (Cavitas glenoidalis) in roe deer is round in shape, and in sheep it is oval. Tuberculum supraglenoidale and Processus coracoideus in sheep are more and in roe deer less developed. Shoulder bone (Humerus) in roe deer is relatively long, slender bone with proximal convexity turned cranially in regard to the same bone in sheep, which is stronger and heavier. <b>Tuberculum</b> <b>majus</b> in roe deer is less developed, and in sheep it is in a form of solid bone protuberance. Tuberculum minus and Tuberositas deltoidea in sheep are more developed than in roe deer. At medial condyle (Condylus medialis) in sheep there is shallow and wide groove, while in roe deer it is deeper and narrower. On the basis of morphological differences of roe deer and sheep bones, it can be determined with certainty which animal spesies they belong to...|$|E
