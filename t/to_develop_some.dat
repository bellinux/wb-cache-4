5|$|In 2015, it was {{reported}} that Broadway producer Kevin McCollum had signed a deal two years earlier with Fox <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>some</b> of the movies from its back catalog into musicals for the stage. Two he expressed particular interest in were Mrs. Doubtfire and The Devil Wears Prada. Early in 2017, McCollum announced that in partnership with Fox Stage Productions, he was developing a musical version of The Devil Wears Prada (based on both the movie and the book). Sir Elton John will be composing the score for the project with playwright Paul Rudnick, who had written some early scenes for the screenplay, mostly with Miranda, writing the book and lyrics. McCollum did not say when he expected it to premiere but hoped it would eventually play on Broadway.|$|E
5|$|Editing began {{later that}} day, {{with the first}} rough cut {{completed}} on March 18. A version was screened on March 30 for Moore, Peter Lauritson, Dan Curry, J. P. Farrell and Dawn Velazquez to better inform the post-production optical effects which were under production at the time. Cast audio re-recording took place from April 9 onwards depending on the individual actor's availability, supervised by Velazquez. Composer Dennis McCarthy first saw a cut of the episode on April 21. He worked with Velazquez and music editor Gerry Sackman <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>some</b> musical cues which could recur throughout the episode as well as working out what type of work {{will need to be}} completed. For example, although he couldn't see the visual effects at the time as they were not yet complete, Velazquez explained what they should look like.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries manorial homes, {{including}} Cranham Hall, became attractive {{properties for}} merchants from the City of London. Initial attempts {{to expand the}} suburban estates from Upminster in the early 20th century ran into problems {{because of the lack}} of water supply. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. In the 1930s land was used <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>some</b> council housing and following the sale of the Benyon estate the pace of new building quickened. Cranham's location on the very edge of London's urban sprawl is explained by the halting effect on suburban house building of the introduction of the Metropolitan Green Belt and World War II. Thereafter building took place within the area bounded by the Southend Arterial Road in the north and St Mary's Lane in the south; and there were 615 council houses built by 1971.|$|E
5|$|The nesting {{specimen}} MPC-D 107/15 {{has provided}} much {{information about the}} taphonomic processes (changes during fossilisation) in the Baruungoyot Formation. The specimen is preserved in facies that {{are thought to have}} been deposited through a sandstorm or dune-shift. It {{does not seem to have}} been transported after death, but the body appears to have shifted slightly to the right, indicating the sediment in which it was deposited came towards it from its left side. The neck is curved to the left, the left hand is folded backwards, and the legs are folded into a crouching position. The vertebral column, neck, and hips deteriorated during burial, and much of the damage to the skeleton is thought to have been caused by the activity of invertebrates. Borings in the bones, burrows, and reworked sediments (perhaps caused by the construction of pupal chambers) in the specimen indicate it was scavenged upon by colonies of skin beetles (Dermestidae) and perhaps other scavenging insects. There are many feeding traces in the joints of the skeleton, and almost all the surfaces where the bones articulated have been obliterated. There are also tunnels in the nest under the neck and skull, and no egg remains have been found in parts with such traces. Modern skin beetles mainly feed on muscle tissue but not on moist materials, and their activity is prevented by rapid burial. It is therefore thought that specimen MPC-D107/15 was only partially buried at first, with the upper part being exposed enough for a colony of skin beetles <b>to</b> <b>develop.</b> <b>Some</b> damage to the skeleton (especially in the vertebral column) may also have been caused by the scavenging of small mammals.|$|E

Tetlock argues that this could be due <b>to</b> <b>developing</b> <b>some</b> sort of mole sight after having been too long into a specific field of expertise.

50|$|The Low Road/High Road Theory on {{transfer}} of learning -(developed by Salomon & Perkins, 1988): Low-road transfer refers <b>to</b> <b>developing</b> <b>some</b> knowledge/skill <b>to</b> {{a high level}} of automaticity. It requires a great deal of practice in varying settings. Examples of areas where automaticity can be achieved: shoe tying, keyboarding, or steering a car. High-road transfer involves the cognitive understanding and purposeful and conscious analysis, mindfulness, and application of strategies that cut across disciplines. In high-road transfer, there is intentional mindful abstraction of an idea that can transfer, and then conscious and intentional application of the idea when faced by a problem where the idea may be useful.|$|R
