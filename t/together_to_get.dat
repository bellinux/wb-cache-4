25|$|Weissmuller {{starred in}} six Tarzan movies for MGM with actress Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane and Cheeta the Chimpanzee. The last three also {{included}} Johnny Sheffield as Boy. Then, in 1942, Weissmuller went to RKO {{and starred in}} six more Tarzan movies with markedly reduced production values. Sheffield also appeared as Boy {{in the first five}} features for RKO. Brenda Joyce took over the role of Jane in Weissmuller's last four Tarzan movies (the first two RKO films had not featured Jane). Unlike MGM, RKO allowed Weissmuller to play other roles, though a three-picture contract with Pine-Thomas Productions led to only one film, Swamp Fire, being made, co-starring Buster Crabbe. In a total of twelve Tarzan films, Weissmuller earned an estimated $2,000,000 and established himself as what many movie historians consider the definitive Tarzan. Although not the first Tarzan in movies (that was Elmo Lincoln), {{he was the first to}} be associated with the now traditional ululating, yodeling Tarzan yell. During an appearance on television's The Mike Douglas Show in the 1970s, Weissmuller explained how the famous yell was created.

[...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, saying [...] "'The Beginning' {{was a pretty good}} premiere episode. I was quite pleased to see how Chris Carter took last season's finale and the movie and tied things <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Season 6 off to a fresh start." [...] Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave it a B. He praised the performance of Chris Owens, noting that he was [...] "acting the shit out of Spender". Despite this, however he called the episode [...] "lackluster" [...] and noted that it [...] "isn’t a great episode of the show, but it works well enough". VanDerWerff's main issue with the entry was that it chose to close off the events of the fifth season finale, but did little to expand upon the revelations of the series' feature film. VanDerWerff also criticized the fact that Scully was, once again, a skeptic in the paranormal after all she saw.|$|E

500|$|... "Hypnotico" [...] {{was written}} by RedOne, Lady Gaga, Aliaune [...] "Akon" [...] Thiam, Claude Kelly and Tami Chynn. In 2007, Gaga and Kelly were working with RedOne in a small {{recording}} studio in Queens, New York. Gaga was writing [...] "what would later become" [...] her debut studio album The Fame (2008) and Kelly was writing songs with RedOne to pitch to other artists. Kelly recalled the events by saying: [...] "We were all friends and often rode the train <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the studio". RedOne began working with Akon, who had signed Chynn to his record label. Akon and RedOne flew Gaga and Kelly to Los Angeles to write songs for Chynn's second studio album Prima Donna. [...] "Hypnotico" [...] became {{the first of several}} songs they had written together. From that trip, according to Kelly, [...] "Akon met, signed and helped launch Lady Gaga's career". Kelly credits the trip as also helping to launch his own songwriting career. He states that he and Akon became good friends and writing partners.

500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Army of Me", a song [...] "so menacing and inorganic-sounding" [...] that, {{according}} to The New York Times, it verges on industrial rock. It is an aggressive technopop song with elements of trip hop. Dedicated to the singer's younger brother, the song's lyrics are, according to Björk herself, [...] "about telling {{someone who is}} full of self-pity and doesn't have anything <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a life and stand up"; as she sings: [...] "And if you complain once more/You'll meet an army of me!" [...] "Hyperballad", which incorporates a spectrum of electronic and orchestral styles, {{has been described as}} [...] "a love song penned by Aphex Twin". NME wrote that its music [...] "altered from gentle folktronica to drum and bass-tinted acid house"; an attempt to reflect the song's lyrics, which are about [...] "the art of not forgetting about yourself". In them, Björk describes living {{at the top of a}} mountain and going to a cliff at sunrise. She throws objects off the cliff while pondering her own suicide. The ritual allows her to exorcise darker thoughts and return to her partner. [...] "Hyperballad" [...] is followed by [...] "The Modern Things", a song that, in a magical realist tone, [...] "playfully posits the theory that technology has always existed, waiting in mountains for humans to catch up". Interview described it in 1995 as a [...] "spooky tune", noting [...] "the odd scratchings at the end" [...] of the track. In his 2000 book Jung and the Postmodern: The Interpretation of Realities, Christopher Hauke described this effect at the end as [...] "when a record player has reached the end of an analogue, vinyl record and the needle is stuck as the disc continues going round"; and considered this [...] "trick" [...] to be a case of postmodernism, serving as an example of [...] "the relationship between the present and past that pushes conceptualising even further by the inclusion of modern technology and its ambivalent relationship with previous forms." [...] In a startling shift in style, the big band track [...] "It's Oh So Quiet" [...] covers a German composition made famous by Betty Hutton. It has been described as [...] "a palate-cleanser during the course of the record". The last song recorded for Post, Björk has said she decided to include it, [...] "just to make it absolutely certain that the album would be as schizophrenic as possible, that every song would be a shock".|$|E
