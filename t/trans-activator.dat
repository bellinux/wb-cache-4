40|$|Transcription {{of nuclear}} genes usually {{involves}} <b>trans-activators,</b> whereas repression is exerted by chromatin. For several genes the transcription mediated by <b>trans-activators</b> and the repression mediated by chromatin {{depend on the}} CP complex, a recently described abundant yeast nuclear complex of the Pob 3 and Cdc 68 /Spt 16 proteins. We report that the N-terminal third of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc 68 protein is dispensable for gene activation but necessary {{for the maintenance of}} chromatin repression. The absence of this 300 -residue N-terminal domain also decreases the need for the Swi/Snf chromatin-remodeling complex in transcription and confers an Spt- effect characteristic of chromatin alterations. The repression domain, and indeed the entire Cdc 68 protein, is highly conserved, as shown by the sequence of the Cdc 68 functional homolog from the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis and by database searches. The repression-defective (truncated) form of Cdc 68 is stable but less active at high temperatures, whereas the known point-mutant form of Cdc 68, encoded by three independent mutant alleles, alters the N-terminal repression domain and destabilizes the mutant protein...|$|R
40|$|We studied {{regulation}} of human immunodeficiency virus- 1 (HIV- 1) transcription by Tat and, for comparative purposes, by the adenovirus E 1 A protein. These two <b>trans-activators</b> exerted different effects. Two classes of HIV- 1 -promoted cytoplasmic RNA were detected, one class corresponding to full-length transcripts {{and the other}} to transcripts ending 55 and 59 nucleotides from the transcription start. Tat increased the level of the full-length class only, whereas E 1 A increased the levels of both classes of RNA. We also measured the effects of Tat and E 1 A on RNA synthesis rates. Without <b>trans-activators,</b> HIV- 1 -directed transcription was relatively weak and exhibited a marked polarity. Both Tat and E 1 A dramatically increased promoter-proximal transcription, while only Tat suppressed transcriptional polarity. Mutations in the TAR element did not influence basal transcription rates or the response to E 1 A, but eliminated trans-activation by Tat. We propose that Tat acts through TAR to increase initiation complex formation on the HIV- 1 promoter and to stabilize complexes during elongation...|$|R

[...] The genome also encodes two regulatory proteins, tat (<b>trans-activator</b> of transcription) and rev (regulator of virion protein expression). A rev response element (RRE) exists inside the env gene. An auxiliary gene, vif (viral infectivity factor), is also encoded.

50|$|Viral {{proteins}} {{involved in}} {{early stages of}} replication include reverse transcriptase and integrase. Reverse transcriptase is the virally encoded RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. The enzyme uses the viral RNA genome as a template for the synthesis of a complementary DNA copy. Reverse transcriptase also has RNaseH activity for destruction of the RNA-template. Integrase binds both the viral cDNA generated by reverse transcriptase and the host DNA. Integrase processes the LTR before inserting the viral genome into the host DNA. Tat acts as a <b>trans-activator</b> during transcription to enhance initiation and elongation. The Rev responsive element acts post-transcriptionally, regulating mRNA splicing and transport to the cytoplasm.|$|E

The potential of this versatile virus for protein expression or gene therapy in mammalian cells has {{become the focus of}} many studies. In most mammalian cells, transduced AcMNPV genes are either not expressed or expressed at an extremely low level. Here, we studied the effects of the two major AcMNPV <b>trans-activators,</b> IE 1 and IE 2, on the activation of AcMNPV genome in Vero E 6 cells. Microarray analysis showed that when IE 1 was overexpressed, it significantly activated genes gp 64 and pe 38, and upregulated ie 2, he 65, pcna, orf 16, orf 17 and orf 25. Although, there were only two genes, pe 38 and orf 17, that were activated by IE 2, we discovered interestingly that the combination of IE 1 and IE 2 factors had a synergistic effect on activation of the AcMNPV genome in mammalian cells, and activated around 38 %, or 59 out of the 155 genes placed on the microarray. This is the first detailed study of baculoviral transcription regulation in mammalian cells, and it shows that the baculoviral genome can be activated in a mammalian system, and also that the two major <b>trans-activators,</b> IE 1 and IE 2, {{play a central role in}} this activation...|$|R

The HIV promoter sequences necessary for trans-activation by EBV {{do not include the}} tat-responsive sequences. In addition, in contrast to the other herpesvirus <b>trans-activators</b> previously studied, the EBV BamHI MLF 1 gene product appears to function in part by a posttranscriptional mechanism, since it increases pHIV-CAT protein activity more than it increases HIV-CAT mRNA.

Several viral genes (vif, vpu, and vpr) facilitate virus infection and/or release and {{may play a role}} in target cell tropism and infection in vivo. The functions of yet other viral genes (nef, vpt) remain unclear.

However, the level of gene expression is often limited by the strength of the mammalian promoter used. Here, we show that the baculovirus RING protein IE 2 is a strong, promiscuous <b>trans-activator</b> in mammalian cells, dramatically upregulating the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in both Vero E 6 and U- 2 OS cells. Further study of the cellular mechanism for the activation led to the discovery of a novel IE 2 nuclear body structure which contains a high concentration of G-actin and closely associates with RNA polymerase II, PML, and SUMO 1. IE 2 mutagenesis studies indicated that the RING and coiled-coil domains of IE 2 were necessary for nuclear body formation, as well as for strong activation of the CMV promoter in mammalian cells. Overall, this study shows that the IE 2 <b>trans-activator</b> could significantly advance the use of baculovirus in mammalian gene transfer and protein production...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{class of}} vaccinia virus genes, called intermediate, is {{expressed}} immediately post-replication and {{prior to the}} onset of late gene transcription. Intermediate transcription is dependent on trans-acting factors which are present in an active state in virus-infected cells prior to the onset of DNA replication. Plasmid-borne intermediate genes transfected into vaccinia-virus infected cells are expressed prior to DNA replication, whereas the copies within the viral genome are repressed. DNA replication is essential for activation of viral intermediate transcription and de novo protein synthesis is not required post-replication. In contrast, activation of late transcription depends on DNA replication and continued de novo protein synthesis. Therefore, a subset of intermediate proteins {{is likely to be}} <b>trans-activators</b> of late gene transcription.

We correlate this phenotype to effects on DNA replication rather than to effects on transcription or specific gene expression. We also demonstrate that a similar truncation of the CTD reduces minichromosome stability and impairs stimulation of DNA replication by <b>trans-activators</b> and that tethering of recombinant pol II CTD to an origin of replication has a significant stimulatory effect on minichromosome stability.

In this report we have characterized the induction of the HTLV-I LTR by 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA). By assaying progressively deleted mutations in the HTLV-I LTR, we have delimited a 60 -base-pair sequence in the LTR which is capable of conferring TPA responsiveness, but not p 40 x responsiveness, to heterologous promoters in a position-independent fashion. This HTLV-I TPA-responsive element is specifically recognized by preexisting factors from uninfected cells. We show that activation of this sequence by phorbol ester does not require de novo cellular protein synthesis. When the HTLV-I LTR was simultaneously activated by both Tax and TPA, an additive effect was seen.

40|$|Abstract The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) <b>trans-activator</b> of transcription protein Tat {{is an important factor}} in viral pathogenesis. In addition to its function as the key <b>trans-activator</b> of viral transcription, Tat is also secreted by the infected cell and taken up by neighboring cells where it has an effect both on infected and uninfected cells. In this review we will focus on the relationship between the structure of the Tat protein and its function as a secreted factor. To this end we will summarize some of the exogenous functions of Tat that have been implicated in HIV- 1 pathogenesis and the impact of structural variations and viral subtype variants of Tat on those functions. Finally, since in some patients the presence of Tat-specific antibodies or CTL frequencies are associated with slow or non-progression to AIDS, we will also discuss the role of Tat as a potential vaccine candidate, the advances made in this field, and the importance of using a Tat protein capable of eliciting a protective or therapeutic immune response to viral challenge. </p...|$|E

40|$|Complex retroviruses are {{distinguished}} by {{their ability to}} control the expression of their gene products through the action of virally encoded regulatory proteins. These viral gene products modulate both the quantity {{and the quality of}} viral gene expression through regulation at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. The most intensely studied retroviral regulatory proteins, termed Tat and Rev, are encoded by the prototypic complex retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1. However, considerable information also exists on regulatory proteins encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus type I, as well as several other human and animal complex retroviruses. In general, these data demonstrate that retrovirally encoded transcriptional <b>trans-activators</b> can exert a similar effect by several very different mechanisms. In contrast, posttranscriptional regulation of retroviral gene expression appears to occur via a single pathway that is probably dependent on the recruitment of a highly conserved cellular cofactor.

40|$|The TCR α {{enhancer}} (Eα) {{has served}} as a paradigm for studying how enhancers organize <b>trans-activators</b> into nucleo-protein complexes thought to recruit and synergistically stimulate the transcriptional machinery. Little is known, however, of either the extent or dynamics of Eα occupancy by nuclear factors during T cell development. Using dimethyl sulfate (DMS) in vivo footprinting, we demonstrate extensive Eα occupancy, encompassing both previously identified and novel sites, not only in T cells representing a developmental stage where Eα is known to be active (CD 4 +CD 8 +–DP cells), but surprisingly, also in cells at an earlier developmental stage where Eα is not active (CD 4 –CD 8 ––DN cells). Partial occupancy was also established in B-lymphoid but not non-lymphoid cells. In vivo DNase I footprinting, however, implied developmentally induced changes in nucleo-protein complex topography. Stage-specific differences in factor composition at Eα sequences were also suggested by EMSA analysis. These results, which indicate that alterations in the structure of a pre-assembled nucleo-protein complex correlate with the onset of Eα activity, may exemplify one mechanism by which enhancers can rapidly respond to incoming stimuli...|$|R

Adenovirus- 5 E 3 and E 4, c-fos and somatostatin regulatory regions containing CRE/ATF-element exhibited responsiveness to p 38 tax in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transient expression assay.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{constructed a}} multiribozyme expression vector by combining cis- and trans-acting ribozymes and {{we showed that}} several ribozymes, each directed against a different target in the HIV genome and acting independently in a 'shotgun' manner, markedly increased the efficiency of cleavage of HIV RNA in vitro [Ohkawa et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 90, 11302 (1993) ]. However, the cis-acting ribozymes that had trimmed the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of each trans-acting ribozyme were designed merely to await for degradation by RNases when they were used in vivo. Since several <b>trans-activator</b> proteins are essential for viral replication of HIV- 1, we wondered whether a decoy function could be coupled with the cleavage activity of ribozymes. We therefore introduced the TAR or the RRE sequence into the stem II region of each cis-acting ribozyme. When the activity of each resulting cis-acting ribozyme that had been endowed with the decoy function was examined in vitro, it was found to retain almost full trimming activity. Moreover, cis-acting ribozymes with either the TAR or the RRE sequence were shown {{to be able to}} trap Tat or Rev protein successfully. It is, therefore, possible to endow the stem II region with a specific protein-binding function without the loss of ribozyme function. Thus, cis-acting ribozymes, endowed with the decoy function, can first trim the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of each trans-acting ribozyme and are then still available for trapping <b>trans-activator</b> proteins possibly prior to their degradation by RNases when they are to be used in vivo. Furthermore, it is also expected that the reduction in production of HIV RNA that is achieved by sequestering the <b>trans-activator</b> proteins might provide the trans-acting ribozymes, targeted to HIV RNA, with a better chance of eliminating the remaining HIV RNA...|$|E

These interactions are mediated by the β-propeller domain comprising the first 380 residues of HCF- 1 with six kelch repeats. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel HCF-like kelch repeat protein, designated HCLP- 1. HCLP- 1 is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein which is composed almost entirely of a six-bladed β-propeller. HCLP- 1 selectively interacts with LZIP but not with VP 16. The physical interaction between HCLP- 1 and LZIP leads to the repression of the LZIP-dependent transcription. The HCLP- 1 -binding domain of LZIP maps to residues 109 - 315, which contain the bZIP DNA-binding motif. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrates that HCLP- 1 indeed interferes with the binding of LZIP to its DNA target. Thus, HCLP- 1 serves a transcriptional co-repressor function mediated through its inhibitory interaction with the LZIP transcription factor.
