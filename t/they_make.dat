5|$|Although {{happy in}} the company of others, they are fine if left alone. Sealyham Terriers are suited for both the town and country. They can be stubborn, vocal, and boisterous but also full of personality. While <b>they</b> <b>make</b> for loyal family companions, they can be trained to be working dogs, making them {{excellent}} mousers or ratters. They can also be taught as a puppy to get along with other animals, including cats and birds.|$|E

After helping to defend the city from the Circle in a hardfought battle, Amelia finds that Beaumont has once again escaped, {{this time with the}} hijacked barrels of the Fountain's water.|$|E
5|$|Another source from 684 AD, {{during the}} Tang dynasty and {{recorded}} in Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, states {{that when the}} leaves are taken internally, <b>they</b> <b>make</b> one incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally they can be effectively used to treat boils, abscesses and itches. Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, catalpa and peach tree to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotic drug {{design is}} {{facilitated}} when an enzyme {{that is essential}} to the pathogen's survival is absent or very different in humans. In the example above, humans do not make peptidoglycan, therefore inhibitors of this process are selectively toxic to bacteria. Selective toxicity is also produced in antibiotics by exploiting differences {{in the structure of the}} ribosomes in bacteria, or how <b>they</b> <b>make</b> fatty acids.|$|E

5|$|Caddisflies {{are best}} known for the {{portable}} cases created by their larvae. About thirty families of caddisfly, members of the suborder Integripalpia, adopt this stratagem. These larvae eat detritus, largely decaying vegetable material, and the dead leaf fragments on which they feed tend to accumulate in hollows, in slow-moving sections of streams and behind stones and tree roots. The cases provide protection to the larvae as <b>they</b> <b>make</b> their way between these resources.|$|E
5|$|Dewi Zephaniah Phillips defended Wittgenstein's theory {{by arguing}} that {{although}} religious language games are autonomous, {{they should not be}} treated as isolated because <b>they</b> <b>make</b> statements about secular events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of this connection, religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events. He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong because it is not empirical.|$|E

Before looking for a mate, a male spider spins a small, flat web on a surface and ejaculates into it. He then loads the semen into syringe-like receptacles in both palps, and then searches for a female.|$|E

5|$|For newly emerged {{adults of}} most {{myrmecophilous}} Lycaenidae, deciduous waxy scales provide some protection from predators as they {{emerge from the}} nest. In {{the case of the}} moth butterfly (Liphyra brassolis), the caterpillars are unwelcome guests in nests of tree ants, feeding on ant larvae. The adults emerging from pupae are covered with soft, loose adhesive scales which rub off and stick on the ants as <b>they</b> <b>make</b> {{their way out of the}} nest after hatching.|$|E
5|$|Frogs are primary {{predators and}} an {{important}} part of the food web. Being cold-blooded, <b>they</b> <b>make</b> efficient use of the food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes, while the rest is transformed into biomass. They are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are the primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates, most of which feed on plants. By reducing herbivory, they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem.|$|E

5|$|Laboratory (brown) rats {{may have}} the {{capacity}} for metacognition—to consider their own learning and then {{make decisions based on}} what they know, or do not know, as indicated by choices <b>they</b> <b>make</b> apparently trading off difficulty of tasks and expected rewards, making them the first animals other than primates to have this capacity, but these findings are disputed, since the rats may have been following simple operant conditioning principles, or a behavioral economic model.|$|E
