40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for fall detection based on two features and their motion characteristics extracted from the human torso. The 3 D positions of the hip center joint and the shoulder center joint in depth images are used to build a fall detection model named the human torso motion model (HTMM). Person’s <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> and centroid height are imported as key features in HTMM. Once a person comes into the scene, the positions of these two joints are fetched to calculate the person’s <b>torso</b> <b>angle.</b> Whenever the angle is larger than a given threshold, the changing rates of the <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> and the centroid height are recorded frame by frame in a given period of time. A fall can be identified when the above two changing rates reach the thresholds. By using the new feature, falls can be accurately and effectively distinguished from other fall-like activities, which are very difficult for other computer vision-based approaches to differentiate. Experiment results show that our approach achieved a detection accuracy of 97. 5 %, 98 % true positive rate (TPR) and 97 % true negative rate (TNR). Furthermore, the approach is time efficient and robust because of only calculating the changing rate of gravity and centroid height...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{shows how the}} robotics theories are applied to model the bipedal walking robot. Utilizing the direct kinematics and inverse kinematics, the kinematic model for the robot is developed. The derivation of joint angle equations for 6 links Robot, walking on a slopping surface, is a direct approach in this research. The development of hip trajectory is another important invention specific to this research. The dynamic stability is analyzed by utilizing ZMP criteria. The calculation of ZMP for this model is very complex and based on mechanics theories. The selection of iteration method to calculate linear accelerations of each link (which are used to calculate ZMP) is guaranteed by simulation results. The dynamic stability is analyzed for lower body using ZMP simulation results. For this case the "Dynamic" Balance Margin (DBM) is introduced and requirement for stability is also introduced. The methods or precautions {{that can be used}} to improve ZMP are identified. The most effected method for improve the stability is selected as control of <b>torso</b> <b>angle.</b> Finally, the modified ZMP is re-derived with the term of <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> and it is found that the ZMP can be moved to safe margin by controlling <b>torso</b> <b>angle.</b> The results show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{aerodynamic}} drag of a cyclist in time trial (TT) position is {{strongly influenced by}} the <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> (Underwood et al. 2011). To minimize drag, cyclists lower their <b>torso</b> <b>angle.</b> Along with the drag the cyclists’ peak power output decreases. There should be a trade-off between the loss in power output and drag as function of cycling velocity. This hypothesis {{is supported by the}} energy expenditure which {{is a function of the}} workload divided by the gross efficiency (GE). The workload to overcome drag decreases with smaller torso angles, while the GE decreases accordingly. Previous literature suggested that the aerodynamic losses outweigh the loss in power output (Lukes et al. 2005). However, these statements are only valid for elite TT cycling velocities, e. g. > 45 km/h. To our best knowledge, there is no published prediction at which speed the aerodynamic power loss starts to dominate. Therefore the aim of this study is to predict the optimal TT cycling position as a function of velocity to improve the performance of non-elite cyclists. Methods: Two models were developed to determine the optimal <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> of TT cyclists: a ‘Power Output Model’ and a ‘Metabolic Efficiency Model’. The Power Output Model predicts the optimal cycling position by maximizing the peak power output minus the power losses due to drag and roll resistance. The Metabolic Efficiency Model minimizes the required cycling energy. Model input parameters were experimentally collected of 19 trained competitive time trial cyclists (Fintelman et al. 2012). The main input variables were the power output, frontal area and GE of the cyclists in different <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> positions (0, 8, 16 and 24 °). The optimal cycling <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> was predicted for speeds between 18 - 50 km/h. Results and discussion: For both models, the optimal <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> is dependent on the cycling velocity, and the <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> exhibited a sigmoid-like shape, with decreasing torso angles at increasing velocities. The Power Output Model curve was shifted to a higher velocity, which could be explained by the different approach of the models. The aerodynamic losses outweighed the power losses for velocities above 45 km/h, which goes in line with the literature. For cycling velocities below 30 km/h the power loss and gross efficiency due to position change were dominant. Furthermore, it is shown that a fully horizontal torso is not optimal. Conclusion and recommendations: It is suggested that despite some limitations, the models give valuable information about the optimal TT cycling position at different speeds for non-elite cyclists. This study showed it is beneficial to ride in a more upright TT position when velocities are below 30 km/h, while at speeds above 45 km/h an almost flat back is optimal. Furthermore, for speeds between 32 - 40 km/h in an endurance event it is advisable to lower the torso despite the fact that the power output in a more aerodynamic position is decreased. In contrast, in sprinting or in variable conditions (wind, undulating course, etc) at these speeds it is more beneficial to ride in a more upright TT position. Our future research will attempt to measure the {{aerodynamic drag}} of all participants in a wind tunnel, to implement a more valid drag coefficient and thus improving the validity of the models. Furthermore, to increase the ecological validity the effect of crosswind will be implemented in future. References: Fintelman, Highton, Adams, Sterling, Hemida, Li (2012) ECSS annual conference.

This is especially true when stylistic changes are needed, for example, to reflect a character’s changing mood, differentiate one character from another or meet the precise desires of an animator. We introduce a system for editing animation data that is particularly well suited to making stylistic changes. Our approach transforms the joint angle representation of animation data into a set of pose parameters more suitable for editing. These motion drives include position data for the wrists, ankles and center of mass, as well as the rotation of the pelvis. We also extract correlations between drives and body movement, specifically between wrist position and the <b>torso</b> <b>angles.</b> The system solves for the pose at each frame based on the current values of these drives and correlations using an efficient set of inverse kinematics and balance algorithms. An animator can interactively edit the motion by performing linear operations on the motion drives or extracted correlations, or by layering additional correlations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with various examples of gesture and locomotion...|$|R

The revolutionary dynamic stability criteria introduced by Prof. Miomir Vukobratovic in 1969 {{has been used}} throughout the thesis. The dynamically stable human walking on slopes are very complex and this thesis address this problem by starting from lower body {{and in the middle}} by adding a torso with the intention of gaining dynamic stability and finishes showing the effectiveness of the variation of <b>torso</b> <b>angle.</b> The ZMP formula presented in the paper of Prof. Miomir Vukobratovic is involved with huge computations and due to that most of the researches in this field have chosen alternatives such as GA and NN to find the ZMP. Although it is convenient to use GA and NN to avoid mathematical calculation the accuracy of resultant ZMP is questionable. The original ZMP equation has been used extensively in all cases to calculate ZMP in this thesis and rather verifies the accuracy of this concept. The simulations have been performed to verify the accuracy of the kinematics models that has been created before moving to the ZMP calculations. The effectiveness of the variation of <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> on the dynamic stability of the bipedal robot has been analyzed by varying slope angle, step length and step time. It is indicated using real ZMP calculations the bipedal robot can maintain its dynamic stability while walking on slopes at any circumstances...|$|E

The overall {{aim of this}} research is to improve the understanding of the effect of cycling position and crosswinds on the aerodynamics and performance of a cyclist. The first part of this thesis focuses on cycling position. To minimise air resistance, cyclists lower their torso to become more aerodynamic. Results show that lowering <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> is associated with impairment of physiological functioning, which can be explained by a combination of mechanical and muscular factors. Consequently, there is a trade-off between aerodynamic gains and physiological impairment. Therefore a mathematical model has been developed predicting the optimal <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> at different cycling speeds. The second part of this thesis aims to understand the flow mechanics around a cyclist subjected to crosswinds. Both wind tunnel experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulations of the flow around a cyclist are used to reveal the effect of crosswinds on cyclists in different cycling positions.

Study 1 tested whether the method could differentiate between highly trained gymnasts and novices, and assessed the reliability of the method.

Using a digitizing stylus, the three-dimensional positions of three anatomical landmarks on the scapula were recorded for 10 manual wheelchair users in six different statically held hand positions (- 30 °, - 15 °, 0 °, 15 °, 30 °, 60 °) on the pushrim. In each hand position, a motion analysis system recorded the coordinates of infrared markers on the arm and torso. Scapular, humeral, and <b>torso</b> <b>angles</b> were computed using an Euler angle decomposition method for each position relative to the torso. At the beginning of the push, the scapula was rotated slightly upward (1. 5 °), minimally protracted (15 °), and maximally tipped forward (22 °). In addition, the humerus was maximally extended, abducted and internally rotated. As subjects moved forward along the pushrim, the protraction angle increased while the forward tipping angle decreased. The humerus became increasingly more flexed as the push progressed with small changes observed in humeral abduction and internal rotation. A stepwise multiple regression analysis procedure (p < 0. 01) revealed that the torso, humeral flexion/extension and abduction angles are good predictors for estimating forward tipping and upward/downward rotation of the scapula. The regression equations enable researchers to estimate scapular orientation during propulsion which could provide further insight into specific biomechanical factors that lead to shoulder pathology...|$|R

Results demonstrated rapid fatigue failure with increased torso flexion; however, a key limitation of this study was the old age of the specimens. Methods. Each lumbosacral spine was dissected into 3 motion segments (L 1 -L 2, L 3 -L 4, and L 5 -S 1). Motion segments within each spine were randomly assigned to a spinal loading condition corresponding to lifting 9 kg in 3 <b>torso</b> flexion <b>angles</b> (020, 22. 520, or 4520). Motion segments were statically loaded and allowed to creep for 15 minutes, then cyclically loaded at 0. 33 Hz.

Compared with the older sample of spines, the middle-aged sample exhibited increased fatigue life (cycles to failure) in all the torso flexion conditions. Increased fatigue life of the middle-aged specimens was associated with the increased bone mineral content (BMC) in younger motion segments (mean 21 SD, 30. 7 11. 1 g per motion segment vs. 27. 8 21 9. 4 g).

In this system, ten body parts including head, torso, arms and legs are extracted to build a 2 D human body model. One way to decompose human silhouette into different parts is to generate cuts between the negative minimum curvature (NMC) points. However, due to the self-occlusion problem and left-right ambiguity, each individual body part cannot be successfully identified in every frame. Therefore, in addition to utilizing the NMC points, we design a forward and backward tracking mechanism to identify the location of head in each frame.

The magnitude of the moment arm of the lumbar erector muscle group is known to vary {{as a function of}} such variables as gender. Anatomical evidence indicates that the moment arms decrease during torso flexion. However, moment arm estimates in biomechanical models that account for individual variability have been derived from imaging studies from supine postures. PURPOSE: Quantify the sagittal plane moment arms of the lumbar erector muscle group as a function of torso flexion, and identify individual characteristics that are associated with the magnitude of the moment arms as a function of torso flexion. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Utilization of a 0. 3 Tesla Open magnetic resonance image (MRI) to image and quantify the moment arm of the right erector muscle group as a function of gender and torso flexion. METHODS: Axial MRI images through and parallel to each of the lumbar intervertebral discs at four <b>torso</b> flexion <b>angles</b> were obtained from 12 male and 12 female subjects in a lateral recumbent posture. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to investigate the differences in th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a detailed description}} of the optimization process used to increase the kicking skills of humanoid players. The kicking movement consists of making a step forward to put the support foot next to the ball to kick, then to execute the kicking motion by rocking the leg that must strike the ball. The rocking motion of the leg passes through three positions; the first position is the leg being raised backward, the second is the leg in position of strike, and the third is the leg forward to sweep the ball. The optimization process is an evolution of skills parameters guided by a evaluation function that aims to send the ball as far as possible. To optimize the kick a rocking motion of the torso is also introduced. The parameters used for each one of the three kicking positions are the <b>angle</b> of the <b>torso,</b> the <b>angle</b> of the foot sole, the longitudinal and the vertical coordinates of the foot toe. Thanks to this technique it is possible to increase the distance of the kicked ball by 34 %. I...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the effect of different stroke rates on various kinematic parameters during 1000 m outrigger canoeing. Sixteen, experienced female outrigger canoeists completed three 1000 m outrigger ergometer time trials, one trial each using a self-selected, a Hawaiian (65 strokes·min- 1) stroke rate. Stroke rate, stroke length, stroke time, proportion {{of time spent in}} propulsion and recovery, <b>torso</b> flexion <b>angle</b> and 'twist' were measured and compared with repeated measures ANOVAs. Stroke rate, stroke length and stroke time were significantly different across all interventions (p < 0. 05) despite no difference in the percentage of time spent in the propulsive and recovery phases of the stroke. Stroke length and stroke time were negatively correlated to stroke rate for all interventions (r = - 0. 79 and - 0. 99, respectively). Female outrigger canoeists maintain consistent stroke kinematics throughout a 1000 m time trial, most likely as a learned skill to maximize crew paddling synchrony when paddling on-water. While the Hawaiian stroke rate resulted in the greatest trunk flexion movement and 'twist' action, this potential increased back injury risk may be offset by the slow stroke rate and long stroke length and hence slow rate of force development...|$|R
40|$|Kaminski, Thomas W. To {{perform a}} proper squat, athletes must be mobile in the ankle, knee, and hip while {{maintaining}} a strong torso to protect the musculature surrounding the spine. Deficits in mobility, especially at the foot and ankle can cause compensation resulting in the widening of the feet and/or turning the toes outward to achieve proper squat depth. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the overhead squat (OHS) in a group of female collegiate athletes and implement an appropriate ankle dorsiflexion mobility exercise program to improve squat performance. A total of 44 female student-athletes (age 18 - 25) were randomly divided into three treatment interventions: (1) Traditional Calf Stretch technique; (2) a joint-capsule release intervention termed "Banded Heel Cord (Anterior Bias) (TM) "; and (3) a soft tissue intervention termed "Barbell Calf Smash(TM) ". A series of measurements were made to analyze the OHS including ankle dorsiflexion motion and movement analysis (<b>torso</b> <b>angle,</b> squat depth, shin angle, knee flare, foot width, and ankle eversion motion) at baseline and following 6 weeks of training. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) tests were used for comparisons between and within the three intervention groups. Improvements in DF ROM following the 6 week intervention period averaged greater than 20 % in both the BHC(TM) and BCS(TM) groups; leading to significant improvements in squat depth in both groups as well. Two contemporary and novel ankle mobility exercises proved beneficial in significantly enhancing DF ROM and squat depth in our population of female student-athletes, who were considered novice to the OHS.

40|$|Textile based piezoresistive {{transducers}} are {{an innovative}} category of devices that use yarns made of conductive and elastic fibers or screen printed conductive rubber coatings to sense strain. They usually satisfy wearability requirements {{and are used}} in real-time information gathering systems, being comfortable, ubiquitous and available for long term monitoring. They include knitted fiber transducers (KFTs), sewed fiber transducers (SFTs) and smeared redundant elastomer (SRETs) transducers. In the latter category, SRETs constituted by Conductive Elastomers (CEs) have been commonly employed as strain sensors networks to detect human posture and gesture. Elastic interconnection wiring is also easily realized leading to monolithic fabrication techniques which avoid the presence of metal wires and multiple solderings. Despite this, {{there is a strong}} dependence of the system performance by the body structure garment fitting. Moreover, the non-linear dynamical behaviour of SRETs requires identification algorithms, functions which relate joint angles to electrical values presented by the sensor network. The construction of these functions is quite complex and time of computation dramatically increases with the number of degrees of freedom and with the accuracy required to the system to be resolved. Recent development of CEs sensor modeling overcomed some of their main limitations and introduced new fields of operability in SRETs networks. In particular, in strain applications, a useful data processing technique is presented for treating the non-linear dynamical response, considering the different behaviour in sensor elongation and relaxation: actually, when the sensor in stretched, the breakdown of carbon black agglomerates produces an increase in resistance. Inversely, when the sensor is relaxed, the cross-link readjustment lead to different electrically conductive paths in respect to the previous states. This technique has found its implementation in multisensory systems, leading to encouraging results in biomechanical reconstruction. Furthermore, a novel approach in CEs sensing is described, relating the global curvature of a layer to its electrical resistance value variation and exploring under which conditions the resistance can be considered uncorrelated with its particular local bending profile. These devices are called Smeared Conductive Elastomer Electrogoniometers (SCEEGs) and under particular configuration they can be employed as on-body electrogoniometers. The integration of SRET arrays and SCEEGs is definitely a powerful tool for human body posture and gesture reconstruction through efficient and fast algorithms. Moreover In this study we introduce a particular realization of CE strain sensors deposed on an adhesive taping, obtaining a very low skin artifact device (VLSA). We present an electrogoniometric system in which the inextensible insulating layer has been replaced by an elastic layer, allowing the system to be employed both as strain sensor and as electrogoniometer. Finally, we present a biomechanical application in lumbar spine posture monitorization. As a matter of fact, it is known from literature that in the sagittal balance there is a strong correlation with the <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> and geometrical parameters of lumbar vertebraes, such as the angle between subsequent upper endplates. Data obtained from piezoresistive sensors are so suitable to be used in biomechanical analysis in order to predict forces and moments acting on the functional spinal units...|$|E

He first titled the work The Vanquished, in which form the left hand held a spear, but he removed the spear because it obstructed the <b>torso</b> from certain <b>angles.</b> After two more intermediary titles, Rodin settled on The Age of Bronze, suggesting the Bronze Age, and in Rodin's words, [...] "man arising from nature".

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to improve a system capable to detect, track a single person and recognize poses real time for controlling a spatial game. After performing background subtraction, the human blob is segmented in order to track the <b>torso</b> and hands. <b>Angles</b> and distances between hands and torso center are used to compute the features. Finally, a 10 -Nearest-Neighbor classifier recognizes 9 predefined Poses which are used by the player to control the game. This work contributes with two improvements. The first one is a more robust improved hand detection combining the current skin color detection with human blob information. The second improvement is a classifier that recognizes Non-Poses in addition to the 9 predefined Poses that are used in the game.

To develop and {{validate}} a new method of predicting the neutral lumbar spine curve from external (non-invasive electrogoniometer) measurements. Background. Non-invasive techniques for lumbar spine geometry prediction suffer {{from a lack of}} a complete geometry description, problems with applicability to field conditions, or both. Methods. The study consisted of three steps. First, utilizing lateral imaging (MRI and X-ray pictures) of the lumbosacral junction, the torso geometry was described using measures of lumbar lordosis via the Cobb method. Second, the relationship between imaging based measurement of lumbar spinal curvature and externally measured <b>torso</b> flexion <b>angle</b> in the sagittal plane using a goniometer was determined. Finally, method validation was performed with an independent set of nine subjects. The predicted lumbar spine curve was determined and the prediction errors were analyzed against the measured curves from digitized lateral X-ray images of the lumbosacral junction. Results. The shape of the lumbar curve was described as function of three externally measured parameters. The lumbar spine Cobb angle, segmental centroid positions (S 1 −T 12), and segmental orientations were predicted from the external lumbar motion monitor measurements, with average precisions of 5. 8 °, 4. 4 mm, and 3. 9 °, respectively. Conclusions. The position and orientation of each segment (vertebrae and disc), along with the lumbar spine lordosis, can be predicted in the neutral posture using data from back angular measurements...|$|R
40|$|Background. There is {{currently}} little information regarding {{factors associated with}} specific modes of motion segment failure using a fatigue failure model. Methods. Thirty-six human lumbar motion segments were fatigue tested using spinal compressive and shear loads that simulated lifting a 9 kg weight in three <b>torso</b> flexion <b>angles</b> (020, 22. 520, and 4520). Twenty-five segments failed via fatigue prior to the 10, 000 cycle maximum. These specimens were visually inspected and dissected so that the mode(s) of failure could be determined. Failure modes included endplate fractures (classified into nine varieties), vertebral body fractures, and/or zygapophysial joint disruption. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine whether certain morphometric variables, amount of motion segment flexion, disk degeneration scores, and/or loading characteristics {{were associated with the}} occurrence of specific failure modes. Findings. Results indicated that stellate endplate fractures were associated with increased posterior shear forces (P < 0. 05) and less degenerated discs (P < 0. 01). Fractures running laterally across the endplate were associated with motion segments having larger volumes (P < 0. 01). Endplate depression was more common in smaller specimens (P < 0. 01), as well as those experiencing increased posterior shear force (P < 0. 05). Zygapophysial joint damage was more likely to occur in a neutral posture (P < 0. 01). Interpretation. These results suggest that prediction of failure modes (e. g., specific endplate fracture patterns) may be possible (at least for older specimens) given knowledge of the spinal loads along with certain characteristics of the lumbar spine.
