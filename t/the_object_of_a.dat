5|$|Mayan {{languages}} are ergative in their alignment. This {{means that the}} subject of an intransitive verb is treated similarly to <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transitive verb, but differently from the subject of a transitive verb.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic is a polysynthetic {{language}} {{that allows the}} creation of long words by stringing together roots and suffixes. Its morphosyntactic alignment is ergative, meaning that it treats (i.e. case-marks) the argument ("subject") of an intransitive verb like <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transitive verb, but distinctly from the agent ("subject") of a transitive verb.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare {{was buried}} in a pyramid in Saqqara named Nefer Djedkare ("Djedkare is perfect"), which is now ruined owing to theft of stone from its outer casing during antiquity. The burial chamber still held Djedkare's mummy when it was {{excavated}} in the 1940s. Examinations of the mummy revealed that he died in his fifties. Following his death, Djedkare was <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cult that lasted {{at least until the}} end of the Old Kingdom. He seemed to have been held in particularly high esteem during the mid-Sixth Dynasty, whose pharaohs lavished rich offerings on his cult. Archaeological evidence suggests the continuing existence of this funerary cult throughout the much later New Kingdom period (c. 1550–1077 BC). Djedkare was also remembered by the Ancient Egyptians as the king of vizier Ptahhotep, the purported author of The Maxims of Ptahhotep, one of the earliest pieces of philosophic wisdom literature.|$|E

5|$|Fischer's {{estate was}} {{estimated}} at 140 million ISK (about 1 million GBP, or $2 million USD). It quickly became <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> legal battle involving claims from four parties, with Miyoko Watai ultimately inheriting what remained of Fischer's estate after government claims. The four parties were Fischer's apparent Japanese wife Miyoko Watai, his alleged Filipino daughter Jinky Young and her mother Marilyn Young, his two American nephews Alexander and Nicholas Targ and their father Russell Targ, and the U.S. government (claiming unpaid taxes).|$|E
5|$|Philip {{then joined}} Cycliadas the Achaean general, near Dyme for a joint {{attack on the}} city of Elis, the main Aetolian base of {{operations}} against Achaea. However, Sulpicius had sailed into Cyllene and reinforced Elis with 4000 Romans. Leading a charge, Philip was thrown from his horse. Fighting on foot Philip became <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fierce battle, finally escaping on another horse. The next day Philip captured the stronghold of Phyricus, taking 4000 prisoners and 20,000 animals. Hearing news of Illyrian incursions in the north Philip abandoned Aetolia and returned to Demetrias in Thessaly.|$|E
5|$|Wagiman is a prefixing language, which, in {{the context}} of {{typology}} of Australian languages, may refer to its genealogical classification as well as its syntactic properties. Wagiman, along with other Gunwinyguan languages, inflects verbs for person and number of the subject obligatorily, and optionally for the object. In this respect Wagiman displays characteristics of a head-marking language. However, Wagiman also behaves as a dependent-marking language, in that nominals are case marked as to their grammatical or semantic roles, such as ergative (the subject of a transitive clause) or absolutive (<b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transitive clause or the subject of an intransitive clause).|$|E

5|$|Boniface of Savoy (c. 1217– 18 July 1270) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Belley in France and Archbishop of Canterbury in England. He {{was the son}} of Thomas, Count of Savoy, and owed his initial ecclesiastical posts to his father. Other members of his family were also clergymen, and a brother succeeded his father as count. One niece was married to King Henry III of England and another was married to King Louis IX of France. It was Henry who secured Boniface's {{election}} as Archbishop, and throughout his tenure of that office he spent much time on the continent. He clashed with his bishops, with his nephew-by-marriage, and with the papacy, but managed to eliminate the archiepiscopal debt which he had inherited on taking office. During Simon de Montfort's struggle with King Henry, Boniface initially helped Montfort's cause, but later supported the king. After his death in Savoy, his tomb became <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cult, and he was eventually beatified in 1839.|$|E
5|$|Sue Hendrickson, amateur paleontologist, {{discovered}} {{the most complete}} (approximately 85%) and the largest Tyrannosaurus fossil skeleton known in the Hell Creek Formation near Faith, South Dakota, on August 12, 1990. This Tyrannosaurus, nicknamed Sue in her honor, was <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> legal battle over its ownership. In 1997 this was settled in favor of Maurice Williams, the original land owner. The fossil collection was purchased by the Field Museum of Natural History at auction for $7.6 million, making it the most expensive dinosaur skeleton to date. From 1998 to 1999 Field Museum of Natural History preparators spent over 25,000 man-hours taking the rock off each of the bones. The bones were then shipped off to New Jersey where the mount was made. The finished mount was then taken apart, and along with the bones, shipped back to Chicago for the final assembly. The mounted skeleton {{opened to the public}} on May 17, 2000 in the great hall (Stanley Field Hall) at the Field Museum of Natural History. A study of this specimen's fossilized bones showed that Sue reached full size at age 19 and died at age 28, the longest any tyrannosaur is known to have lived. Early speculation that Sue may have died from a bite {{to the back of the}} head was not confirmed. Though subsequent study showed many pathologies in the skeleton, no bite marks were found. Damage to the back of the skull may have been caused by post-mortem trampling. Recent speculation indicates that Sue may have died of starvation after contracting a parasitic infection from eating diseased meat; the resulting infection would have caused inflammation in the throat, ultimately leading Sue to starve because she could no longer swallow food. This hypothesis is substantiated by smooth-edged holes in her skull which are similar to those caused in modern-day birds that contract the same parasite.|$|E
