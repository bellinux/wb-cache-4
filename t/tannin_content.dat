5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is a very}} {{bold and}} {{assertive}} wine that has potential to overwhelm light and delicate dishes. The wine's high <b>tannin</b> <b>content</b> {{as well as the}} oak influences and high alcohol levels associated with many regional styles play important roles in influencing how well the wine matches with different foods. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, all those elements are at their peak, but as the wine ages it mellows; possibilities for different food pairings open up. In most circumstances, matching the weight (alcohol level and body) of the wine to the heaviness of the food is an important consideration. Cabernet Sauvignons with high alcohol levels do not pair well with spicy foods due to hotness levels of the capsaicins present in spices like chili peppers being enhanced by the alcohol with the heat accentuating the bitterness of the tannins. Milder spices, such as black pepper, pair better due to their ability to minimize the perception of tannins—such as in the classic pairings of Cabernet Sauvignon with steak au poivre and pepper-crusted ahi tuna.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{material}} {{makes up}} the majority of most lemur diets. Members of at least 109 of all known plant families in Madagascar (55%) are exploited by lemurs. Since lemurs are primarily arboreal, most of these exploited species are woody plants, including trees, shrubs, or lianas. Only the ring-tailed lemur, the bamboo lemurs (genus Hapalemur), and the black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata) are known to consume herbs. While Madagascar is rich in fern diversity, these plants are rarely eaten by lemurs. One possible {{reason for this is that}} ferns lack flowers, fruits, and seeds—common food items in lemur diets. They also occur close to the ground, while lemurs spend most of their time in the trees. Lastly, ferns have an unpleasant taste due to the high content of tannins in their fronds. Likewise, mangroves appear to be rarely exploited by lemurs due to their high <b>tannin</b> <b>content.</b> Some lemurs appear to have evolved responses against common plant defenses, however, such as tannins and alkaloids. The golden bamboo lemur (Hapalemur aureus), for instance, eats giant bamboo (Cathariostachys madagascariensis), which contains high levels of cyanide. This lemur can consume twelve times the typically lethal dose for most mammals on a daily basis; the physiological mechanisms that protect it from cyanide poisoning are unknown. At the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in the United States, lemurs that roam the outdoor enclosures have been observed eating poison ivy (Taxicodendron radicans), yet have shown no ill effects.|$|E

40|$|A {{practical}} {{approach for}} determining <b>tannin</b> <b>contents</b> is very useful for sorghum breeders. <b>Tannin</b> <b>contents</b> were determined with vanillin-HCl method for 24 sorghum entries varying in origin, pericarp color, {{presence or absence}} of testa and testa color. The relations of these kernel characteristics with their <b>tannin</b> <b>contents</b> were investigated. It was revealed that dark color pericarp produces trace amount of tannins, while the <b>tannin</b> <b>contents</b> in the sorghum cultivars with purple testa were much lower than those with brown testa. Subdivision of type 1 and type 2 sorghum was proposed to provide sorghum breeders more practical classification system for selecting cultivars with suitable <b>tannin</b> <b>contents...</b>|$|R

25|$|Wines {{made from}} Sangiovese tend to exhibit the grape's {{naturally}} high acidity {{as well as}} moderate to high <b>tannin</b> <b>content</b> and light color. Blending can have a pronounced effect on enhancing or tempering the wine's quality. The dominant nature of Cabernet can sometimes have a disproportionate influence on the wine, even overwhelming Sangiovese character with black cherry, black currant, mulberry and plum fruit. Even percentages as low as 4 to 5% of Cabernet Sauvignon can overwhelm the Sangiovese if the fruit quality is not high. As the wine ages, some of these Cabernet dominant flavours can soften and reveal more Sangiovese character.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of a caterpillar can often repel a predator: its markings and certain body parts can make it seem poisonous, or bigger in size and thus threatening, or non-edible. Some types of caterpillars are indeed poisonous or distasteful and their bright coloring is aposematic. Others may mimic dangerous caterpillars or other animals while not being dangerous themselves. Many caterpillars are cryptically colored and resemble the plants on which they feed. An example of caterpillars that use camouflage for defence is the species Nemoria arizonaria. If the caterpillars hatch {{in the spring and}} feed on oak catkins they appear green. If they hatch in the summer they appear dark colored, like oak twigs. The differential development is linked to the <b>tannin</b> <b>content</b> in the diet. Caterpillars may even have spines or growths that resemble plant parts such as thorns. Some look like objects in the environment such as bird droppings.|$|E

500|$|Ammonia fuming is a wood {{finishing}} process that darkens wood and {{brings out the}} grain pattern. [...] It consists of exposing the wood to fumes from a strong aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide which reacts with the tannins in the wood.

[...] Other species may also be fumed but usually will not darken as much as white oak.
