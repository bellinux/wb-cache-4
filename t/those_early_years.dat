25|$|Watertown's first {{settlers}} {{built their}} homesteads {{on what is}} now the square's West End in 1800. In 1805, several settlers donated land for public use which became the basis of the square. This helped to develop the square as Watertown's main business district. The current layout of the square and its surrounding streets developed in <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{mixture of}} {{criticism}} and nostalgia by some 20 adults born in Kibbutzim in the 1930s was {{documented in the}} 2007 film Children of the Sun. The film raised much controversy and brought about a flood of reactions in favor and against the practices of child raising in Kibbutzim in <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> of the Kibbutz. Interviews were interlaced with original footage.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} called Mother and Child {{is attributed}} to <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>years.</b> The baby has been interpreted as an indirect reference to Agostino Tassi, her rapist, as it dates back to 1612, just 2 years after the rape. The painting appeared in a Swedish private collection during the 1960s. It depicts a strong and suffering woman and casts light on her anguish and expressive artistic capability.|$|E
50|$|In <b>those</b> <b>earliest</b> <b>years,</b> {{the church}} had no pastor, laving with sporadic, mostly nonexistent records. That changed in 1775, when it agreed to share a pastor with the Reformed Church in New Paltz. The {{arrangement}} worked well enough that the two churches pooled their resources to build a parsonage three years later.|$|R

Some of Edison's earliest inventions were related to telegraphy, including a stock ticker. His first patent was for the electric vote recorder, , which was granted on June 1, 1869.|$|E
25|$|PDF was {{developed}} in the early 1990s as a way to share computer documents, including text formatting and inline images. It was among a number of competing formats such as DjVu, Envoy, Common Ground Digital Paper, Farallon Replica and even Adobe's own PostScript format. In <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> before the rise of the World Wide Web and HTML documents, PDF was popular mainly in desktop publishing workflows.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} Stirling engines {{to run at}} very high {{temperatures}} to maximize power and efficiency exposed limitations in the materials of the day, and the few engines that were built in <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> suffered unacceptably frequent failures (albeit with far less disastrous consequences than boiler explosions). For example, the Dundee foundry engine {{was replaced by a}} steam engine after three hot cylinder failures in four years.|$|E

Going back to <b>those</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>years</b> offers insight into the history of Autumn Leaf Festival™.|$|R
5000|$|SES {{representative}} Ian Mason also {{responded to}} criticism in Jules Evans 2013 book. He said: [...] "The {{idea is not}} {{to break down the}} ego for the sake of it, but rather to put you in touch with yourself, to help you distinguish what's real or not, and to nourish and strengthen the mind. But perhaps there was too unquestioning an attitude to the leader in <b>those</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>years.</b> People took things that MacLaren said and applied them without intelligence." ...|$|R
5000|$|Back in {{the days}} before {{corporate}} consultants, KISS-FM was 12,900 watts and their AM sister station was KMAC. KMAC broadcast show tunes, opera, as well as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir until they simulcasted the rock format with KISS-FM later in the day/evening. In <b>those</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>years,</b> KISS-FM signed off at midnight each night. KMAC/KISS was originally owned by Howard W. Davis. [...] "Spread The Word" [...] - was the popular window sticker slogan & on-air moniker during the 1970s & 1980s.

25|$|In <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> Van Zandt {{supplied}} a {{great deal}} of the lead guitar work for the band in concert, as can be seen on the 1975 concert DVD within Born to Run 30th Anniversary Edition (later released as the CD Hammersmith Odeon London '75). In 1984, Van Zandt left the E Street Band. He originally joined to see Bruce Springsteen rise in success, and once the band rose to that success he left.|$|E
25|$|During <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> the {{majority}} of the university's basketball games were played against nearby YMCA teams, with YMCAs across the nation having played an integral part in the birth of basketball. Other common opponents were Haskell Institute and William Jewell College. Under Naismith, the team played just one game against a current Big 12 school, a matchup with rival Kansas State University. Naismith was, ironically, the only coach in the program's history to have a losing record (55–60).|$|E
25|$|Some {{development}} {{took place}} along Washington Street north of Alexander in <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>years.</b> A few houses, {{such as the}} mildly detailed brick house at 395, remain from this time. The earliest hints of the area's future as an immigrant neighborhood began with some Irish settling in that area. Bassett Street was home to a small community of free African Americans, and there was enough of a Jewish presence that a group was meeting for services there in 1838.|$|E

25|$|By 1979 Vince {{decided to}} start his own wrestling company. He {{purchased}} the Cape Cod Coliseum in Massachusetts and founded Titan Sports, Inc. in 1980. The McMahons held small hockey and other sporting events in addition to wrestling at the Cape Cod Coliseum. At one point, Linda cooked meatball sandwiches to feed the fans at these sporting events. As the company grew, Linda assisted Vince with administration and used her knowledge of intellectual property law to assist in trademark protection for the company. During much of <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> she personally had little interest in professional wrestling.|$|E
25|$|Yashin’s debut for Dynamo came in 1950 in a {{friendly}} match. It was not the debut he would have hoped for, as he conceded a soft goal scored straight from a clearance by the opposing keeper. That year he played in only two league games, and did not appear in a senior match again until 1953. But he remained determined, and stayed at Dynamo in the reserves waiting for another opportunity. Yashin also played goalie for the Dynamo ice hockey team during <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> of trying {{to break into the}} senior squad. He managed to win a USSR ice hockey cup in 1953 and was third in the USSR ice hockey championship as goalkeeper.|$|E
25|$|Over its {{decade of}} {{existence}} the Birkenhead Mobile Library issued nearly 15,000 items a year. At one point, 1984, 24,128 items, equivalent {{to more than}} 10% of the building's issue; though on average about half that. On the other hand, Birkenhead as {{a subset of the}} whole North Shore Libraries system, has averaged 16% of the total issues. This figure excludes <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> when there were no other libraries on the North Shore, but includes the introduction of branches at Takapuna, Northcote, Devonport, East Coast Bays, Glenfield, and the system Mobile, as well as the start and cessation of Birkenhead's Mobile, the impact of amalgamation, and the shift to and from various buildings.|$|E

He conducted concerts with the IPO in South Lebanon in 1982, after which the Arabs rushed onstage to hug the musicians. He conducted it during the Gulf War in 1991, where the audience brought their gas masks; and in 2007 it played for an entirely Arab audience in Nazareth. He claims to have a [...] "deep kinship" [...] with Israel's musicians and the [...] "spirit and tradition of the Jewish people." [...] He adds that conducting the IPO is [...] "something I do for my heart." [...] Recalling <b>those</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>years,</b> he says, [...] "How I {{would love to see}} that sight again today, of Arabs and Jews hugging each other. I'm a positive thinker.

25|$|The Australian Music Industry as a {{business}} began to formalise during the late 1960s and the 1970s. Although not taken seriously by the mainstream business community in <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> none could discount the pioneering spirit and business acumen of the likes of Michael Gudinski, Michael Chugg, Ray Evans, Dennis Charter, Glenn Wheatley, Harry M. Miller, Harley Medcalf, Michael Browning, Peter Rix, Ron Tudor, Roger Davies, Fred Bestall, Lance Reynolds, Alan Hely, Frank Stivala, Sebastian Chase, Philip Jacobsen, Peter Karpin, Roger Savage, John Sayers, Ernie Rose, Bill Armstrong (Australian music producer), Kevin Jacobsen, Phil Dwyer, Ken Brodziak, Denis Handlin, Stan Rofe, Jade Johnson, Terry Blamey and Ian 'Molly' Meldrum. These were the people largely responsible for promoting and developing the Australian music 'business' during those formative years.|$|E
500|$|The NWOBHM– {{comprising}} bands {{with very}} different influences and styles– was promoted as both a movement and a distinct music genre only in its formative years during the mid-to-late 1970s. Especially in <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> what characterised the flood of new music was its raw sound, {{due in large part}} to low-budget productions, but also to the amateurish talents of many young bands. Those young musicians were also linked by a shared inspiration from the works of the aforementioned successful heavy rock bands of the late 1960s and 1970s, and kept a sort of continuity with the earlier acts, whose music had temporarily gone out of fashion, but was still thriving underground. However, the media of the 1980s and the promotional literature of record labels typically placed rock music that employed loud guitars, but was not classifiable as [...] "punk" [...] under the blanket term [...] "heavy metal", subsuming the entire spectrum of NWOBHM bands within a single music genre.|$|E

Jeremy Botter of Heavy.com wrote: [...] "Ken Shamrock {{used to be the}} baddest man on the planet. In the early days of mixed martial arts, it was tough to find anybody who inspired more fear than Shamrock. His muscled and ripped frame...his intensity was unequaled in the sport at the time, and his bag of submissions made him a very real threat to any opponent he faced during <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>years.</b> But <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> were a long time ago, and Shamrock is no longer even a shell of the man he once was." ...|$|E
50|$|Cage's love of {{professional}} wrestling {{and desire to}} be a wrestler began with watching it on television as a kid. During <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>year</b> Cage became friends with the late Chris Kanyon following a show that was held in Sacramento at Arco Arena where he made a sign that Kanyon noticed. Kanyon then became Cage's biggest advocate in his decision to pursue professional wrestling as a career. This eventually led to him and his friends starting their own Federation in 2004 called Main-Event Wrestling Federation (MWF) in Chico, CA. Cage's wrestling debut happened at an MWF show, against Kanyon. This eventually lead to a second show where Kanyon once again faced Cage. Cage ended up winning both matches against Kanyon. During this time, Cage had been training at Pro Championship Wrestling. Also, Cage competed at All Pro Wrestling. This continued until Cage, under Kanyon's advise, left to move to Atlanta to be in WWE's then developmental territory Deep South Wrestling.|$|R
