5|$|Some {{claim that}} {{swooping}} {{can be prevented}} by hand-feeding magpies. Magpies will become accustomed to being fed by humans, and although they are wild, {{will return to the}} same place looking for handouts. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, there are reports of its success.|$|E
5|$|Granule cells receive all {{of their}} input from mossy fibers, but outnumber them by 200 to 1 (in humans). Thus, the {{information}} in the granule cell population activity state is the same as {{the information in the}} mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more expansive way. Because granule cells are so small and so densely packed, it is difficult to record their spike activity in behaving animals, so there is little data to use as a basis for theorizing. The most popular concept of their function was proposed in 1969 by David Marr, who suggested that they could encode combinations of mossy fiber inputs. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> with each granule cell receiving input from only 4–5 mossy fibers, a granule cell would not respond if only a single one of its inputs were active, but would respond if more than one were active. This combinatorial coding scheme would potentially allow the cerebellum to make much finer distinctions between input patterns than the mossy fibers alone would permit.|$|E
5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.|$|E
5000|$|The APPD {{propagated}} <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a [...] "youth pension", {{to replace}} the existing old-age pension. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> people should enjoy life first, and work later.|$|R
5000|$|Web is an {{information}} space through which people can communicate, but communicate {{in a special}} way: communicate by sharing their knowledge in a pool. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> not just <b>that</b> it should <b>be</b> a big browsing medium. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> everybody would <b>be</b> putting their <b>ideas</b> in, as well as taking them out.|$|R
50|$|Usually, {{efforts to}} {{transform}} women {{were scheduled to}} follow or even accompany collectivization in most regions. By aligning collectivization with <b>the</b> hujum, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Soviets could more easily control and intervene in the everyday life of the Uzbeks.In the beginning stages the hujum was not applied universally. Instead, only Communist Party members and their immediate families were required to participate in <b>the</b> campaign. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> only after {{this portion of the}} campaign demonstrated the change in these families would it be spread to non-Communists, like trade-union members, factory workers, and schoolteachers.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> two debts can be {{combined}} into a single debt of greater magnitude.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{involves the}} use of signalling theory, and possibly the handicap principle. Here <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a mobbing bird, by apparently putting itself at risk, displays its status and health so as to be preferred by potential partners.|$|E
25|$|Leitkultur (core culture): A model {{developed}} in Germany by Bassam Tibi. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> minorities {{can have an}} identity of their own, but they should at least support the core concepts of the culture on which the society is based.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} propositions {{as far as}} the origin of name of [...] "Zmerynka" [...] is concerned. One of <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it may <b>be</b> derived from the Polish words, {{describing}} the handshake.|$|R
5000|$|Humm job: It {{could be}} a song, a commercial, perhaps a {{repetitive}} song in a video game. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> if you heard something repetitive it would be stuck in your head all day long.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> light {{waves are}} {{replaced}} by a diffusion process that uses complex numbers. In this way of thinking, there are only interference patterns, similar to how antenna patterns are formed from interference: ...|$|R
25|$|In one {{application}} Blowfish's slow key changing {{is actually}} a benefit: the password-hashing method used in OpenBSD uses an algorithm derived from Blowfish that makes use of the slow key schedule; <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the extra computational effort required gives protection against dictionary attacks. See key stretching.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} {{technique used}} above can be greatly extended {{to many other}} types of equations. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the operator uxx with the zero boundary conditions can be represented {{in terms of its}} eigenvectors. This leads naturally to one of the basic ideas of the spectral theory of linear self-adjoint operators.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{after this}} they created Prentiss McCabe, {{which is the}} subject of Absolute Power. The tone and style of Absolute Power is so {{different}} from the In the... series that it can be regarded as a totally different programme. It was produced, like so much of Tavener's work, by Dawn Ellis.|$|E
5000|$|Those {{who engaged}} in such traffic {{obscured}} it with the euphemism [...] "apprenticeship." [...] <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> this label would encourage the masters not to drive their helpless servants {{to the point of}} ill treatment.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the ondertrouw period can vary. Historically the period <b>was</b> three weeks. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{there had to be}} enough time to {{determine}} that all legal and ecclesiastical requirements for marriage had been complied with.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after its}} {{founding}} in 1980, Trinity was amongst three schools <b>that</b> <b>were</b> included in a proposal by the then Education minister, Wal Fife. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> schools with falling enrolments should take in students from private schools.|$|R
25|$|ImpactGames {{launches}} in February 2008 {{the program}} Play the News. It is a web-based platform used to publish mini-games {{based on the}} news. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> interactivity allows {{a better understanding of}} an event, rather than passive reading. A game is designed to be played from ten to twenty minutes, and to be developed in a day.|$|E
25|$|Income {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used attributes of a household to determine its class status. The relationship between income, which mostly arises from the scarcity of a certain skill, may however, prove to be more complex than initially perceived. While <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> income reflects status, household income may just be the product of two or more incomes.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{prevalence}} of vitamin A deficiency in developing countries, there are efforts to produce genetically modified rice rich in β-carotene. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this would help poor people, {{who can not afford}} a varied diet containing sufficient natural sources of vitamin A, meet their dietary needs. The golden rice project is one such effort, and is already undergoing trials.|$|E
50|$|As a {{new century}} {{approached}} Berghaus introduced the Simplex concept in 1997: <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> by minimising <b>the</b> layers of fabric in a garment and getting rid of any unnecessary styling you achieve a more breathable, lightweight product.|$|R
50|$|Pennywell {{was opened}} to the public in 1989 by husband and wife, Christopher and Nicola Murray. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{visitors}} to <b>the</b> farm would not <b>be</b> spectators but <b>that</b> they would <b>be</b> able to have hands-on interaction with the animals.|$|R
25|$|The {{correlation}} of flu epidemics with the sunspot cycle, with epidemics occurring at the minimum of <b>the</b> cycle. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> flu contagion <b>was</b> scattered in {{the interstellar medium}} and reached Earth only when the solar wind had minimum power.|$|R
25|$|Foreign {{exchange}} fixing is {{the daily}} monetary exchange rate fixed {{by the national}} bank of each country. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> central banks use the fixing time and exchange rate to evaluate the behavior of their currency. Fixing exchange rates reflect {{the real value of}} equilibrium in the market. Banks, dealers and traders use fixing rates as a market trend indicator.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{by reading}} his writings, one {{can become a}} true {{strategist}} from ability and tactical skill that Musashi had learned in his lifetime. He argues that strategy and virtue are {{something that can be}} earned by knowing the ways of life, the professions around, and perhaps to learn the skills and knowledge of people and the skills of their particular professions.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> {{operating}} {{behind the}} veil of ignorance, they will choose a social contract {{in which there is}} basic fairness and justice for them no matter the position they occupy. Rawls did not include species membership as one of the attributes hidden from the decision makers in the original position. Rowlands proposes extending {{the veil of}} ignorance to include rationality, which he argues is an undeserved property similar to characteristics including race, sex and intelligence.|$|E
2500|$|In 1898 the burlesque {{producers}} and theater managers attempted to organize {{in a similar}} way with the Travelling Variety Managers Association (TVMA). <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> approved shows would progress from one theater to another in succession, round a [...] "wheel".|$|R
50|$|The zeugitae {{could serve}} as hoplites in the Athenian army. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> one {{could serve as}} a hoplite if he had enough money to equip himself in that manner, i.e. he could produce 200 medimnoi or more per year.|$|R
50|$|Some {{development}} of self-diagnostic controls {{began at the}} onset of the 21st Century. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> stairlifts would predict when components were starting to deteriorate and automatically pass the information to the service provider so a visit could be arranged.|$|R
25|$|These time {{intervals}} {{would seem}} to be reversed; this is an area where public policy trumps science. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> for women beyond age 35, every month counts and if made to wait another 6 months to prove the necessity of medical intervention, the problem could become worse. The corollary to this is that, by definition, failure to conceive in women under 35 isn't regarded with the same urgency as it is in those over 35.|$|E
25|$|Adding {{a second}} {{extraction}} agent, octyl(phenyl)-N, N-dibutyl carbamoylmethyl phosphine oxide(CMPO) {{in combination with}} tributylphosphate, (TBP), the PUREX process {{can be turned into}} the TRUEX (TRansUranic EXtraction) process. TRUEX was invented in the USA by Argonne National Laboratory and is designed to remove the transuranic metals (Am/Cm) from waste. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> by lowering the alpha activity of the waste, the majority of the waste can then be disposed of with greater ease. In common with PUREX this process operates by a solvation mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The term group {{intelligence}} is sometimes used interchangeably {{with the term}} collective intelligence. Anita Woolley presents Collective intelligence {{as a measure of}} group intelligence and group creativity. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a measure of collective intelligence covers a broad range of features of the group, mainly group composition and group interaction. The features of composition that lead to increased levels of collective intelligence in groups include criteria such as higher numbers of women in the group as well as increased diversity of the group.|$|E
5000|$|The {{correlation}} of flu epidemics with the sunspot cycle, with epidemics occurring at the minimum of <b>the</b> cycle. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> flu contagion <b>was</b> scattered in {{the interstellar medium}} and reached Earth only when the solar wind had minimum power.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> birds {{which used}} to live in Skamija, have left. Unfortunately they took all colour with them. They even took the sounds, thus {{encapsulating}} [...] "Skamija" [...] in silence - hence the name of the issue.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a challenge-based {{approach}} would bring together resources and knowledge across different fields, technologies and disciplines, including {{social sciences and}} the humanities. In fact, research activities in Horizon 2020 now bridge research to market with innovation-related activities, such as piloting.|$|R
