5|$|The {{anatomy of}} pterosaurs was highly {{modified}} from their reptilian ancestors by the adaption to flight. Pterosaur bones were hollow and air-filled, like {{the bones of}} birds. They had a keeled breastbone that was developed for the attachment of flight muscles and an enlarged brain that shows specialised features associated with flight. In some later pterosaurs, the backbone over the shoulders fused into a structure known as a notarium, which served to stiffen <b>the</b> <b>torso</b> during flight, and provide a stable support for the scapula (shoulder blade).|$|E

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Controlled {{laboratory}} study in a cadaveric model. OBJECTIVE: To determine if removing shoulder pads using <b>the</b> elevated <b>torso</b> technique generated less spinal segment motion than using <b>the</b> flat <b>torso</b> method. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Guidelines for {{care of the}} injured football player with a suspected spinal injury recommend initial immobilization with shoulder pads and helmet in place. There {{is a need to}} develop a safe protocol, for shoulder pad removal that maintains optimum cervical stability. METHODS: Five lightly embalmed cadavers were studied before and after a globally unstable segment was created at C 5 -C 6. A trained group of medical staff conducted repeated measures trials for 2 pad removal protocols. <b>The</b> elevated <b>torso</b> technique, outlined by the NATA Inter-Association Task Force, is the same as <b>the</b> flat <b>torso</b> except an additional assistant is employed to lift the patient 2 ̆ 7 s shoulders 30 degrees to 40 degrees off the ground while the head holder maintains spinal alignment as the pads are removed. An electromagnetic tracking device captured angular and linear motions in 3 planes between the C 5 -C 6 segments. RESULTS: <b>The</b> elevated <b>torso</b> technique generated significantly less C 5 -C 6 motion in flexion/extension (P = 0. 015) and lateral bending (P = 0. 001), with a trend toward decreased cervical motion in axial rotation (P = 0. 052). When moving the spine-injured cadavers, linear translation was also slightly, but not significantly less when <b>the</b> elevated <b>torso</b> technique was used. In the intact spine, significantly less motion was seen in 5 of 6 measures when <b>the</b> elevated <b>torso</b> technique was used. However, the differences were not large enough to be clinically significant in an intact spine. CONCLUSION: These findings support use of <b>the</b> elevated <b>torso</b> method to minimize cervical spine motion during shoulder pad removal when neither thoracic nor lumbar spinal injury is a concern...|$|R
5|$|The diet of Pteranodon {{is known}} to have {{included}} fish; fossilized fish bones have been found in the stomach area of one Pteranodon, and a fossilized fish bolus has been found between the jaws of another Pteranodon, specimen AMNH 5098.

5|$|The {{most obvious}} feature of Scelidosaurus is its armour, {{consisting}} of bony scutes {{embedded in the}} skin. These osteoderms were arranged in horizontal parallel rows down the animal's body. Osteoderms are today found in the skin of crocodiles, armadillos and some lizards. The osteoderms of Scelidosaurus ranged in both size and shape. Most were smaller or larger oval plates with a high keel on the outside, the highest point of the keel positioned more to the rear. Some scutes were small, flat and hollowed-out at the inside. The larger keeled scutes were aligned in regular horizontal rows. There were three rows of these along each side of <b>the</b> <b>torso.</b> The scutes of the lowest, lateral, row were more conical, rather than the blade-like osteoderms of Scutellosaurus. Between these main series, one or two rows of smaller oval keeled scutes were present. There were in total four rows of large scutes on the tail: one at the top midline, one at the midline of the underside, and one at each tail side. Whether the midline tail scutes continued over <b>the</b> <b>torso</b> and neck to the front is unknown and unlikely for the neck, though Scelidosaurus is often pictured this way.|$|E
5|$|The motor {{system of}} the brain is {{responsible}} for the generation and control of movement. Generated movements pass from the brain through nerves to motor neurons in the body, which control the action of muscles. The corticospinal tract carries movements from the brain, through the spinal cord, to <b>the</b> <b>torso</b> and limbs. The cranial nerves carry movements related to the eyes, mouth and face.|$|E

5|$|The puppets of Thunderbirds Are Go are of {{identical}} proportions {{to the television}} puppets. However, while production of the film continued, AP Films developed a prototype with a latex mouth to result in more realistic movement of the lips and jaws. However, this animatronic technology proved to be insufficiently advanced and the idea was abandoned. For the later television series Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, a brand-new puppet design of realistic anatomical proportions made its debut appearance when the solenoid of the lip-synch mechanism was relocated from the puppet head to <b>the</b> <b>torso</b> area.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{variation}} in the exact features, those at Kaminaljuyu have fat bodies with short, thick necks and large heads, sometimes wearing a wide collar. The faces are depicted with incised lines and are heavy and coarse.

Kaminaljuyu has the greatest concentration of potbelly sculptures in any site, with several of them found concentrated in the Palangana monument plaza.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning <b>the</b> <b>torso,</b> moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E

5|$|Players {{are further}} {{encouraged}} to customize their characters through nano-augmentations—cybernetic devices that grant characters superhuman powers.

For example, the arm augmentation requires the player to decide between boosting their character's skill in hand-to-hand combat or his ability to lift heavy objects.|$|E

5|$|Though {{perhaps the}} actual total of {{cervical}} vertebrae was {{as high as}} seven or eight, the neck was only moderately long. <b>The</b> <b>torso</b> was relatively flat in side view, however, despite the belly being broad, it was not extremely vertically compressed as with ankylosaurs but taller than wide. The last three dorsal vertebrae had no ribs. The spines of the sacral vertebrae touched each other but were not fused into a supraneural plate. The quickly tapering tail was relatively short, probably representing about half of body length. The tail chevrons were strongly inclined to the rear. The hip area and tail base were stiffened by large numbers of ossified tendons.|$|E
5|$|Viviparous mammals {{are in the}} {{subclass}} Theria; {{those living}} today are in the marsupial and placental infraclasses. Marsupials have a short gestation period, typically shorter than its estrous cycle and gives birth to an undeveloped newborn that then undergoes further development; in many species, this takes place within a pouch-like sac, the marsupium, located {{in the front of}} the mother's abdomen. This is the plesiomorphic condition among viviparous mammals; the presence of epipubic bones in all non-placental mammals prevents the expansion of <b>the</b> <b>torso</b> needed for full pregnancy. Even non-placental eutherians probably reproduced this way. The placentals give birth to relatively complete and developed young, usually after long gestation periods. They get their name from the placenta, which connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake.|$|E
