60|$|There {{were three}} chances {{of the way}} of {{spending}} the evening too. The first, the family party alone, this was pretty well, and though not charming, was by far the best; Mrs. Lyddell's talk was agreeable, and to sit with Caroline, and perhaps with the addition of Walter, at the small <b>table,</b> <b>working,</b> reading, and talking, was as quiet and comfortable a way of passing the time as might be. A dinner party at home was next best, for she had her own quiet corners of conversation, and Walter would sometimes come and take shelter there too, and get into a talk, as well as if the room were empty of company, sometimes better, because his mother could not hear him, and he was never so backward in telling his real mind, as in her hearing. Worst of all was a party from home, where she knew few persons, and disliked all she knew.|$|E

60|$|Tea {{had been}} {{finished}} and put away, {{and the family}} was disposed about the dining-room engaged in various evening occupations; Phoebe sat at the <b>table</b> <b>working</b> at some mathematical problem, Clementina was reading with her chin on her fist and a frown on her brow; Lady Ella, Miriam and Daphne were busy making soft washing cloths for the wounded; Lady Ella had brought home the demand for them from the Red Cross centre in Burlington House. The family was all downstairs in the dining-room because the evening was chilly, {{and there were no}} fires upstairs yet in the drawing-room. He came into the room and exchanged greetings with Lady Ella. Then he stood for a time surveying his children. Phoebe, he noted, was a little flushed; she put passion into her work; on the whole she was more like Eleanor than any other of them. Miriam knitted with a steady skill. Clementina's face too expressed a tussle. He took up one of the rough-knit washing-cloths upon the side-table, and asked how many could be made in an hour. Then he asked some idle obvious question about the fire upstairs. Clementina made an involuntary movement; he was disturbing her. He hovered for a moment longer. He wanted to catch his wife's eye and speak to her first. She looked up, but before he could convey his wish for a private conference with her, she smiled at him and then bent over her work again.|$|E

He then dragged her body out of the kitchen and into her bedroom. When Kemper's grandfather, Edmund Emil Kemper, came home from grocery shopping, Kemper went outside and fatally shot him in the driveway. He was unsure of what to do next and so phoned his mother, who urged him to contact the local police. Kemper then called the police and waited for them to take him into custody.|$|E

The original design of the reinforcing structure is a grillage structure to strengthen the <b>working</b> <b>table.</b> In order to improve the design, the cutting edge technology of topology optimization is employed to redesign the reinforcing structure. The result obtained by topology optimization shows that the redesigned topology of the reinforced structure is totally {{different from that of}} the original design. With the same material used, the stiffness and the natural frequencies of the <b>working</b> <b>table</b> are much higher than the original design. Even with a less amount of material use, the stiffness and the natural frequencies are still improved significantly...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBatik {{industries}} are small medium enterprises supported by Indonesian Government. Batik industries produce {{two kinds of}} Batik called Write batik and Stamp Batik. Stamp Batik production process involves of four main stages; 1. Stamp batik Design, 2. Stamp tool preparation, 3. Wax ink stamping process, 4. Batik immersion. All of those mentioned processes are done traditionally. There are some aspects among all those four aspects that could be improved using scientific study without eliminating their originality. There is one process in Stamp tool preparation stage called stamp tool scraping process which was done without any scientific study. This arises to a problem called workers musculoskeletal disorders due to awkward posture. This research aims to design an ergonomic <b>working</b> <b>table</b> called batik stamp tool scraping <b>working</b> <b>table</b> to improve <b>working</b> posture during stamp tool scraping process.
