5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} {{vertical}} column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>group</b> generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell. Consequently, elements in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>group</b> {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number. However, {{in some parts of the}} periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.|$|E
5|$|Against all odds, El Salvador {{finished}} 3rd in the 2013 Copa Centroamericana mean qualification for the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup in the US in July when El Salvador shares <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>group</b> as Honduras, Trinidad and Tobago and Haiti.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the tournament}} was {{established}} by an amateur champion, Bobby Jones, the Masters {{has a tradition of}} honoring amateur golf. It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current U.S. Amateur champion always plays in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>group</b> as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{missed the}} opening game of France's {{short-lived}} UEFA Euro 2008 campaign, {{where they were}} eliminated in the group stages after being drawn in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>group</b> as Italy, the Netherlands and Romania.

5|$|Antigonid Macedonian kings {{relied on}} various {{regional}} officials to conduct affairs of state. This included high-ranking municipal officials, {{such as the}} military strategos and the politarch, i.e. the elected governor (archon) of a large city (polis), {{as well as the}} politico-religious office of the epistates. No evidence exists about the personal backgrounds of these officials, although they may have been chosen among <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>group</b> of aristocratic philoi and hetairoi who filled vacancies for army officers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} she {{completed}} Italian Food, Lehmann's publishing firm had been closed down by its parent company, and David found herself under contract to Macdonald, another imprint within <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>group.</b> She intensely disliked the company and wrote a most unflattering portrait {{of it in a}} 1985 article. Disliking the approach to her books that the company took, she left Macdonald and signed a contract with the publisher Museum Press for her next book, Summer Cooking, which was published in 1955.|$|E

5|$|Each group plays a {{round-robin}} tournament, {{in which}} each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>group.</b> This means that {{a total of six}} matches are played within a group. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled {{at the same time to}} preserve fairness among all four teams. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since 1994, three points have been awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss (before, winners received two points).|$|E
5|$|For a {{short time}} during his playing days with the Giants, Bonds {{temporarily}} changed his demeanor {{at the behest of}} a group of teammates, resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant demeanor. Shortly thereafter, {{in the midst of a}} slump, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>group</b> of teammates pleaded that he revert, having seemingly lost his competitive edge, and causing the team lose more. In spite of his protest that they would not appreciate the results, his teammates insisted, and Bonds complied, maintaining that familiar standoffish edge the rest of his playing career.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium is a shiny, silvery, {{ductile metal}} that is {{corrosion-resistant}} and chemically similar to zirconium (due to its {{having the same}} number of valence electrons, being in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>group,</b> but also to relativistic effects; the expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly cancelled out by the lanthanide contraction). The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.|$|E
25|$|On 21 March, Israeli sources {{reported}} that Johnston {{may have been}} taken by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>groups</b> that captured Gilad Shalit in June 2006. However, this was strongly denied by both the Popular Resistance Committees.|$|R

50|$|Today’s Gamers MMO Focus Report, {{published}} in March 2010, {{was commissioned by}} TNS and gamesindustry.com. A similar study for the UK market-only (UK National Gamers Survey Report) was released in February 2010 by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1999, another rodent from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>group</b> was described: Noronhomys, a {{recently}} extinct species from the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha. Michael Carleton and Storrs Olson, who described the animal, argued that Holochilus primigenus was probably outside the clade of Noronhomys and extant Holochilus and that H.primigenus should probably {{be excluded from}} the genus. When Ulyses Pardiñas described another extinct rodent from this group, Carletonomys from the Pleistocene of Argentina, he suggested that H. primigenus should be placed in its own genus because of its mosaic of Holochilus- and Lundomys-like features.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Richard Apps and Martin Garwicz {{summarized}} {{evidence that}} microzones themselves {{form part of}} a larger entity they call a multizonal microcomplex. Such a microcomplex includes several spatially separated cortical microzones, all of which project to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>group</b> of deep cerebellar neurons, plus a group of coupled olivary neurons that project to all of the included microzones {{as well as to the}} deep nuclear area.|$|E
5|$|In late July, a {{boy named}} John Billington became lost for {{some time in the}} woods around the colony. It was {{reported}} that he was found by the Nauset, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>group</b> of Native Americans on Cape Cod from whom the Pilgrims had unwittingly stolen corn seed the prior year upon their first explorations. The English organized a party to return Billington to Plymouth. The Pilgrims agreed to reimburse the Nauset for the corn which they had taken in return for the Billington boy. This negotiation did much to secure further peace with the Native Americans in the area.|$|E
50|$|In {{algebraic}} topology, {{a branch}} of mathematics, a homotopy sphere is an n-manifold that is homotopy equivalent to the n-sphere. It thus has <b>the</b> <b>same</b> homotopy <b>groups</b> and <b>the</b> <b>same</b> homology <b>groups</b> as <b>the</b> n-sphere, and so every homotopy sphere is necessarily a homology sphere.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{different}} {{views about the}} extent of the Darug nation. While some historians believe the coastal Eora people were a separate group to the Darug people, others believe the two groups were part of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>grouping.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{qualification}} for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Scotland {{were drawn}} in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>group</b> as England, facing their rivals {{in a competitive}} fixture {{for the first time}} since 1999. On 11 November 2016, England beat Scotland 3–0 at Wembley. The return match saw Leigh Griffiths score two late free-kicks to give Scotland a 21 lead, but Harry Kane scored in added time to force a 22 draw. A draw in Slovenia in the final game of the group ended Scottish hopes of a play-off position, and Strachan subsequently left his position by mutual consent.|$|E
5|$|In {{qualifying}} for UEFA Euro 1992, Wales {{were placed in}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>group</b> as World Champions Germany, and finished just one points behind the Germans after conceding just six goals in their six games. Wales beat Germany 1–0 at the Cardiff Arms Park on 5 June 1991, and three months later beat Brazil in a friendly by the same scoreline. The game which settled the qualifying group came in Nuremberg on 16 October 1991, and Wales lost 4–1 to the Germans, ending Southall's Wales record run of 385 minutes without conceding an international goal.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, several reports {{enumerated}} {{the numerous}} abnormalities reported previously, and confirmed the previously enunciated theory that metabolic impairment and portosystemic shunting are the underlying mechanism behind hepatic encephalopathy, {{and that the}} nitrogen-rich compounds originate from the intestine. Many of these studies were done by Professor Dame Sheila Sherlock (1918–2001), then at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School in London and subsequently at the Royal Free Hospital. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>group</b> investigated protein restriction and neomycin.|$|E
