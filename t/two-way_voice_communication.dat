2500|$|Buses and streetcars use the Communications and Information System (CIS). This system employs {{transmit}} facilities {{throughout the}} city. Each bus and streetcar has a Transit Radio Unified Microprocessor (TRUMP) set on board. This {{is attached to}} a transponder receiver, which allows CIS operators to track the location of the vehicle using an older computational system known as dead reckoning. The TRUMP also allows the operators and CIS operators to send and receive text messages for such things as short turns and route adjustments. There is also the option of voice communications between the operator and the CIS operator. The CIS was conceived in the late 1970s and was fully implemented in 1991. With the introduction of the NextBus GPS technology, the CIS positioning system is now using a combination of GPS data and the old dead reckoning sign-post system. In the event that internally managed TTC communications are unavailable, the TRUMP unit operates on Bell Mobility's CDMA network to communicate with divisional operations and transit control. Recently, the TTC began research into transitioning from the outdated and antiquated CIS to a newer computer aided dispatch (CAD/AVL) system. Utilizing this technology would help improve headways, provide more reliable communications and allow divisional supervisors to locate vehicles in real time (the current GPS system only sends location updates every 20 seconds). There is no current estimate of when this technology is to be implemented. Each TRUMP unit on every streetcar and bus is equipped with a silent [...] "yellow alarm" [...] key which can be activated by the operator {{in the event of an}} emergency on board. When activated, CIS supervisors and transit control dispatchers are able to hear what is going on via a high-quality boom microphone located in front of the steering wheel and dispatch emergency responders. There is also a [...] "red alarm" [...] key, which enables one way communication with CIS once pressed. This can be used in events such as fires when immediate assistance is required and <b>two-way</b> <b>voice</b> <b>communication</b> would prove detrimental to safety.|$|E

40|$|Time {{division}} {{multiple access}} (TDMA) based channel access {{is one of the}} most widely used mechanisms in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) with its efficient channel access and collision free transmissions at its core. In this paper, we propose a unique TDMA frame format designed specifically for supporting <b>two-way</b> <b>voice</b> <b>communication</b> in bandwidth efficient manner. The proposed algorithm uses single radio channel for both control and data message exchanges and achieves multi-hop communication. As the transmission of control messages in the same channel leads to overhead, we propose a mechanism to share the control slots between the nodes for reducing the control overhead. The TDMA frame design shows the optimized channel sharing based on the periodicity and payload size of a typical voice packet. The experimental analysis is performed on Network Simulator (NS- 3) as well as on Linux kernel with Ethernet emulation of wireless network.

40|$|Inspections under {{international}} agreements related to nonproliferation of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons place sensitive commercial and national-defense information at risk. Facility operators can control risk to sensitive information by denying physical access to inspectors and providing alternative means of inspection. Similarly, exposure of inspectors and facility personnel to radiation or hazardous environments can be reduced, and damage to sensitive processing environments {{can be avoided}} if inspection objectives can be achieved {{without the need for}} direct physical access by inspectors. A system developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) enables inspectors to achieve inspection objectives in sensitive or hazardous areas by providing virtual presence at an inspection location in place of physical presence. The system has two parts, a mobile unit operated by facility personnel and a stationary base station operated by inspectors. The mobile and stationary units are connected by a fiber-optic communications link. The mobile unit is equipped with two video cameras, a global positioning system (GPS) with dead-reckoning capability, distance measuring equipment (DME), and a theodolite. Five unused channels of RS- 232 are available to accommodate data transfer from and control of additional sensor modules.
