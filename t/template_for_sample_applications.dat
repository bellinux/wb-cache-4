Translating knowledge between these fields can be complicated and time consuming. With the vast range of ultrasonic equipment available, nearly every research group uses different or unique devices. Hence, recreating the experimental conditions and results may be expensive or difficult. For this reason, we have developed devices to combat the common problems seen in state-of-the-art biomedical ultrasound research. In this paper, we present the design, fabrication, and characterisation of an open-source device that is easy to manufacture, allows <b>for</b> parallel <b>sample</b> sonication, and is highly reproducible, with complete acoustic calibration.

40|$|International audienceA {{simple and}} {{effective}} mean for controlling electrostatic interactions during mineral precipitation in {{water is the}} use of a "catanionic" template. Such strategy is used to precipitate calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite or HAP) and obtain mesoporous materials. Mixtures of catanionic surfactants with phosphate head-groups (polyoxyethylene oleyl ether phosphate) and a quaternary ammonium (myristyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) are used in order to obtain a template with adjustable surface charge and test the "charge-matching" effect. This effect manifests by a strong dependence of the template shape on molar fraction, which governs the charge per unit area of the surfactant as well as the growth of inorganic network. We first explore the effect of high ionic strength and pH variation on phase diagram of template. A hexagonal structure is observed for anionic surfactant, and such organization is still preserved in the presence of large quantity of cationic component. Synthesis of HAP is then performed using independently various volume fractions of template and various mole fraction of anionic component in the <b>template.</b> <b>For</b> <b>samples</b> with low amount of surfactant and an excess of anionic component, TOC analysis shows more than 80 % of the added surfactant is trapped in the precipitate. These samples display in SAXS three peaks that are characteristic of a hexagonal structure. Such structure, where the repetition distance is much lower than twice surfactant chain length, has not yet been described in surfactant self-assembly. This must be a monolayer microstructure, but symmetry group is not known since higher orders cannot be detected.

All lower order statistics can also be calculated simultaneously for little extra cost. To test the estimator we make use of a non-linear density field, and for a more strongly non-Gaussian test case we use a toy-model of reionization in which ionized bubbles at a given redshift are all of equal size and are randomly distributed. Our tests find that the FFT estimator remains accurate over a wide range of k, and so should be extremely useful for analysis of 21 -cm observations.
