The catalytic effects of Ce/Zr/Ni and Ce/Zr/Ni/Zn on the pyrolysis products were examined, revealing that CO 2, CO, and H- 2 were dramatically increased and pyrolytic water was decreased when using these catalysts. The <b>tar</b> <b>collected</b> in the cooling traps showed a slight increase after catalysis. Compared to the no-catalyst condition, heterocyclic compounds and multicyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the tar were significantly reduced, and benzene derivatives and aliphatics were increased.

40|$|The {{thermoplastic}} {{development of}} a coking coal was studied before and after treatment to study the impacts on thermoswelling and volatiles release. The treatment process consisted of two consecutive steps, namely mild pyrolysis and solvent extraction. The intention was to characterize the thermally generated and solvent extractable material produced immediately prior to swelling onset and to study the impact of its removal. The heating step removed ∼ 5 % of the coal volatiles and reduced its swelling extent from 83 % to 25 %. Subsequent solvent extraction with tetrahydrofuran (THF) on the heated coal removed up to 21 % of material on a dry basis. The residue after extraction showed little swelling extent and significantly altered volatiles release profile on heating, indicating the role of extracted materials in thermoplastic development and tar formation. The molecular weight distributions of volatile <b>tars</b> <b>collected</b> after pyrolysis shared a similar molecular weight distribution spanning between 200 and 600 Da and peaking at ∼ 347 Da. By comparison, the molecular weight distribution of the THF extract peaked at ∼ 472 Da and extended to ∼ 3000 Da. In addition, it consisted of two classes of compounds: one covered the molecular weight range of tars with repeating structures every 12 – 14 Da up to 600 Da and the other contained 24 Da reoccurring units at molecular weight above 600 Da...|$|R

40|$|Deforestation and {{shortage}} of wood are serious environmental issues in Southern Province of Rwanda. This {{is likely to}} happen due to inadequate strategies and capacity to produce and utilize wood for energy on a sustainable basis. Furthermore, the production of charcoal in rural areas is done through the earth mound kilns causing more pressure on forests due to increased demand of charcoal. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the charcoal yield produced from improved and traditional methods. This study was conducted in Nyabimata sector of Nyaruguru District and Tare sector of Nyamagabe District in June and July 2012. Improved charcoal and traditional charcoal were produced in order to determine the best method to be used. Data were analyzed using the Gen Stat Discovery 4 th Edition. The results revealed that improved techniques can increase the charcoal production and reduce the air pollution where one can obtain at least 3 bags of charcoal in 1 m 3 of wood and 15 liters of <b>tar</b> <b>collected</b> from the chimney containing the major elements responsible for green house gases emission. The yields of charcoal obtained according to the weight of wood used were less in traditional earth mound kiln (T 1) techniques with the percentage of 7. 5 % than what improved earth mound kiln (T 2) and casamance kiln (T 3) techniques produced with 19 % and 20 % respectively.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{characterisation}} of tar from two configurations of bioresidue thermochemical conversion reactors designed for producer gas based power generation systems. The pulverised fuel reactor is a cyclone system (R 1) and the solid bioresidue reactor (denoted R 2) is an open top twin air entry system both at 75 - 90 kg/h capacity (to generate electricity similar to 100 kVA). The reactor, R 2, has undergone rigorous test in a major Indo-Swiss programme for the tar quantity at various conditions. The former is a recent technology development. <b>Tars</b> <b>collected</b> from these systems by a standard tar collection apparatus at the laboratory at Indian Institute of Science have been analysed at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Sweden. The results of these analyses show that these thermochemical conversion reactors behave differently from the earlier reactors reported in literature {{in so far as}} tar generation is concerned. The extent of tar in hot gas is about 700 - 800 ppm for R 1 and 70 - 100 ppm for R 2. The amounts of the major compounds - naphthalene and phenol-are much lower that what is generally understood to happen in the gasifiers in Europe. It is suggested that the longer residence times at high temperatures allowed for in these reactors is responsible for this behavior. It is concluded the new generation reactor concepts extensively tried out at lower power levels hold promise for high power atmospheric gasification systems for woody as well as pulverisable bioresidues...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Tar</b> balls <b>collected</b> {{from the}} Gulf of Mexico shores of Louisiana and Florida after the BP oil spill {{have shown the}} {{presence}} of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra characteristic of organic free radicals as well as transition metal ions, predominantly iron(III) and manganese(II). Two types of organic radicals were distinguished: an asphaltene radical species typically found in crude oil (g = 2. 0035) and {{a new type of}} radical resulting from the environmental transformations of crude (g = 2. 0041 − 47). Pure asphaltene radicals are resonance stabilized over a polyaromatic structure and are stable in air and unreactive. The new radicals were identified as products of partial oxidation of crude components and result from the interaction of the oxidized aromatics with metal ion centers. These radicals are similar to semiquinone-type, environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) previously observed in combustion-generated particulate and contaminated soils.
