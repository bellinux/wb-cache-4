40|$|This {{dissertation}} makes {{recommendations for}} the reform of graduate education to better serve current and future <b>two-year</b> <b>college</b> English instructors. The author undertakes historical and archival research to write a history of how English instructors have been prepared for the distinct profession of <b>two-year</b> <b>college</b> teaching. In addition, the author interviews <b>two-year</b> <b>college</b> English instructors from around the United States to chronicle their preparation narratively and how said preparation has affected their working experience. Drawing on the historical, narrative and current practices found in the research, the author details specific interventions, {{in the form of}} equity-centered partnerships, to improve preparation of community college writing faculty, including partnerships between graduate programs and two-year institutions, explicit and specific graduate coursework, and recognizing and promoting <b>two-year</b> <b>college</b> composition research as a discipline. In addition, the author examines how reform movements surrounding graduate school should incorporate these equity-centered partnerships into their programs to move English graduate education’s locus toward equity with <b>two-year</b> <b>college</b> English. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} NLSY to examine (1) the returns to <b>two-year</b> <b>college,</b> (2) whether {{attendance}} at a <b>two-year</b> <b>college</b> helps students {{to transfer to}} four-year college, and (3) whether reducing tuition would alter attendance enough to affect labor outcomes. I find that the returns to a year of <b>two-year</b> <b>college</b> are large (7 to 10 percent). Completing an associate's degree raises wages further. One year of two-year credits has {{the same effect on}} subsequent four-year attendance as one year of four-year credits.
