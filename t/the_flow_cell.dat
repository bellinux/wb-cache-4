25|$|MinION's high {{error rate}} (~10-40%) {{prevented}} identification of antimicrobial resistance markers, for which single nucleotide resolution is necessary. For {{the same reason}} eukaryotic pathogens were not identified. Ease of carryover contamination when re-using same <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> (standard wash protocols don’t work) is also a concern. Unique barcodes may allow for more multiplexing. Furthermore, performing accurate species identification for bacteria, fungi and parasites is very difficult, as they share a larger portion of the genome, and some only differ by <5%.|$|E
25|$|HPLC most {{commonly}} uses a UV-Vis absorbance detector, however, {{a wide range}} of other chromatography detectors can be used. A universal detector that complements UV-Vis absorbance detection is the Charged aerosol detector (CAD). A kind of commonly utilized detector includes refractive index detectors, which provide readings by measuring the changes in the refractive index of the effluent as it moves through <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell.</b> In certain cases, it is possible to use multiple detectors, for example LCMS normally combines UV-Vis with a mass spectrometer.|$|E
25|$|The {{first steps}} of RNA-seq also include similar image processing, however, {{conversion}} of images to sequence data is typically handled automatically by the instrument software. The Illumina sequencing-by-synthesis method {{results in a}} random or ordered array of clusters distributed {{over the surface of}} a flow cell. <b>The</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> is imaged up to four times during each sequencing cycle, with tens to hundreds of cycles in total. Flow cell clusters are analogous to microarray spots and must be correctly identified during {{the early stages of the}} sequencing process. In Roche’s pyrosequencing method, the intensity of emitted light determines the number of consecutive nucleotides in a homopolymer repeat. There are many variants on these methods, each with a different error profile for the resulting data.|$|E

50|$|The major {{drawback}} to dynamic image acquisition is that <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> depth must be limited as described above. This means that, in general, particles larger in size than <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> depth {{can not be}} allowed in the sample being processed, because they will probably clog the system. So the sample will typically have to be filtered to remove particles larger than <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> depth prior to being evaluated. If it is desired {{to look at a}} very wide range of particle size, this may mean that the sample would have to be fractionated into smaller size range components, and run with different magnification/flow cell combinations.|$|E
50|$|The single {{molecule}} fluorescent sequencing {{is carried}} out on a glass flow cell with 25 channels for the same or different samples. The system can be run with either one or two flow cells at a time. In the standard configuration, each channel is equivalent and holds approximately 8 μl. Samples are generally loaded with higher volume (usually 20 μl or more) to ensure even hybridization {{along the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell.</b> Samples are inserted into <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> via the sample loader included with the overall system.

50|$|Many systems include various {{optional}} components. A filter may {{be added}} between the mixer and column to minimize clogging. In large FPLC columns the sample may be {{loaded into the}} column directly using a small peristaltic pump rather than an injection loop. When the buffer contains dissolved gas, bubbles may form as pressure drops where the buffer exits the column; these bubbles create artifacts if they pass through <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cells.</b> This may be prevented by degassing the buffers, e.g. with a degasser, or by adding a flow restrictor downstream of <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cells</b> to maintain a pressure of 1-5 bar in the effluent line.|$|R

50|$|To obtain DNA sequence, the DNA nanoballs are {{attached}} to a microarray flow cell (Figure 5). <b>The</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> is a 25 mm by 75 mm silicon wafer coated with silicon dioxide, titanium, hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), and a photoresist material.

50|$|Heliscope {{sequencing}} is {{a method}} of single-molecule sequencing developed by Helicos Biosciences. It uses DNA fragments with added poly-A tail adapters which are attached to <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> surface. The next steps involve extension-based sequencing with cyclic washes of <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> with fluorescently labeled nucleotides (one nucleotide type at a time, as with the Sanger method). The reads are performed by the Heliscope sequencer. The reads are short, averaging 35 bp. In 2009 a human genome was sequenced using the Heliscope, however in 2012 the company went bankrupt.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> is {{characterized}} by its depth perpendicular to the optical axis, {{as shown in the}} second diagram on right. In order to keep the particles in focus, the flow depth is restricted so that the particles remain in a plane of best focus perpendicular to the optical axis. This is similar in concept to the effect of the microscope slide plus cover slip in a static imaging system. Since depth of field decreases exponentially with increasing magnification, the depth of <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> must be narrowed significantly with higher magnifications.|$|E
40|$|Capillary flow in microchannels has {{received}} substantial attention of investigation recently {{due to its}} potential applications in microfluidics. This paper will report the new findings of capillary flow behavior in microfluidic Hele- Shaw <b>flow</b> <b>cells.</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>cells</b> with a rectangular cross section of 50 × 50, 50 × 500, 20 × 200, and 50 × 1000 μm were used. It was observed that {{the shape of the}} meniscus varied with cell size and aspect ratio. The shape was also strongly affected by the contact lines on both sidewalls and <b>the</b> gas phase <b>flow</b> in front of the meniscus. For cells with same height, the meniscus was stretched more in <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> direction for wider cells. The measured averaged speed of the interface was 5. 7, 8. 3, 8. 3 and ~ 8 mm/s for <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cells</b> with a cross section of 50 × 50, 50 × 500 and 50 × 1000 μm, respectively. The speed of interface movement was not affected significantly by the aspect ratio for the values used in the current study. The average speed for <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cells</b> agree reasonably well with the value from the theoretical analysis...|$|R

30|$|First, monolaurin was {{dissolved}} in methanol and mixed with media {{in order to}} facilitate dissolution. The final concentration of monolaurin in BHI-S medium was 95 or 190  mg/l with 0.48  % methanol. S. mutans was incubated in 5  ml of BHI medium for 24  h at 37  °C without shaking. The cells were diluted to an OD 600 of 0.15 with BHI-S media and inoculated in a 350  μl volume. <b>The</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cells</b> were incubated for 1  h with the coverslip side down. <b>The</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cells</b> were turned over and fed with media for 24  h at a speed of 13  ml/h according to a previous study (Wen et al. 2006). Biofilm formed on the coverslips was observed after 1 and 24  h of incubation using an Axio Scope.A 1 microscope (Carl Zeiss Co., LTD., Seoul, Korea) with ZEN microscope software (Carl Zeiss Co., LTD.).|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} the {{generated}} electrical pulse varies with the particle path through the aperture. Shoulders and other artifacts can occur because the electric field density varies across {{the diameter of the}} aperture. This variance is a result of both the physical constriction of the electric field and also the fact that the liquid velocity varies as a function of radial location in the aperture. In <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> format, this effect is minimized since sheath flow ensures each particle travels an almost identical path through <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell.</b> In the aperture format, signal processing algorithms can be used to correct for artifacts resulting from particle path.|$|E
50|$|After each DNA probe/ligation step, <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> is imaged to {{determine}} which nucleotide base bound to the DNA nanoball. The fluorophore is excited with an arc lamp that radiates specific wavelengths of light towards <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell.</b> The wavelength of the fluorescence of each DNA nanoball is captured on a high resolution CCD camera. The image is then processed to remove background noise and assess the intensity of each point. The color of each DNA nanoball corresponds to a base at the interrogative position and a computer records the base position information. The order of 70 nucleotides per DNA nanoball is determined using 80 images (8 rounds of 10 interrogative positions per round).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> {{format is}} most {{commonly}} implemented in hematology instruments, and sometimes flow cytometers. In this format, electrodes are embedded {{at either end}} of a flow channel and the electric field is applied through the channel. This format has several advantages as opposed to the aperture format. This arrangement allows for continuous sample analysis whereas the aperture format is single-batch format. Further, the use of a flow cell lends itself to addition of a sheath flow, which keeps particles centered {{in the middle of the}} flow channel. This allows measurements to be performed simultaneously, such as probing the object with a laser. The major disadvantages of <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> format are that it is much more expensive to manufacture and is typically fixed to one channel width, whereas the aperture format offers a wide variety of aperture sizes.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{conventional}} chemical treatment on initiation and spatiotemporal development of biofilms on reverse osmosis (RO) membranes {{was investigated in}} situ using <b>flow</b> <b>cells</b> placed in parallel with the RO system of a full-scale water treatment plant. <b>The</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cells</b> got <b>the</b> same feed (extensively pre-treated fresh surface water) and operational conditions (temperature, pressure and membrane flux) as the full-scale installation. With regular intervals both the full-scale RO membrane modules and <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cells</b> were cleaned using conventional chemical treatment. For comparison some <b>flow</b> <b>cells</b> were not cleaned. Sampling was done at different time periods of <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> operation (i. e., 1, 5, 10 and 17 days and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months). The combination of molecular (FISH, DGGE, clone libraries and sequencing) and microscopic (field emission scanning electron, epifluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy) techniques {{made it possible to}} thoroughly analyze the abundance, composition and 3 D architecture of the emerged microbial layers. The results suggest that chemical treatment facilitates initiation and subsequent maturation of biofilm structures on the RO membrane and feed-side spacer surfaces. Biofouling control might be possible only if the cleaning procedures are adapted to effectively remove the (dead) biomass from the RO modules after chemical treatmen...|$|R

For these simulations, all four walls of <b>the</b> rectangular <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> were considered “smooth,” i.e., k s =  0. The agreement between the experimental and simulation results indicates the clean walls of <b>the</b> rectangular <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> to be hydrodynamically smooth.

50|$|Once attached, cluster {{generation}} can begin. The goal is {{to create}} hundreds of identical strands of DNA. Some will be the forward strand; the rest, the reverse. Clusters are generated through bridge amplification. Polymerases move along a strand of DNA, creating its complementary strand. The original strand is washed away, leaving only the reverse strand. At the top of the reverse strand there is an adapter sequence. The DNA strand bends and attaches to the oligo that is complementary to the top adapter sequence. Polymerases attach to the reverse strand, and its complementary strand (which is identical to the original) is made. The now double stranded DNA is denatured so that each strand can separately attach to an oligonucleotide sequence anchored to <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell.</b> One will be the reverse strand; the other, the forward.

50|$|The {{next step}} is called reduced cycle amplification. During this step, {{sequences}} for primer binding, indices, and terminal sequences are added. Indices are usually six base pairs long and are used during DNA sequence analysis to identify samples. Indices allow for up to 96 different samples to be run together. During analysis, the computer will group all reads with the same index together. The terminal sequences are used for attaching the DNA strand to the flow cell.Illumina uses a “sequence by synthesis” approach. This process takes place inside of an acrylamide-coated glass flow cell. <b>The</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> has oligonucleotides (short nucleotide sequences) coating {{the bottom of the}} cell, and they serve to hold the DNA strands in place during sequencing.

50|$|Once the DNA strand {{has been}} read, the strand {{that was just}} added is washed away. Then, the index 1 primer {{attaches}}, polymerizes the index 1 sequence, and is washed away.

Three copies of a three-organism-bacterial consortium was grown on hydroxyapatite (HA) surfaces in a continuous culture system and exposed to repeated solution pulses of sucrose solution every 12 h to construct a cariogenic biofilm on the HA discs in <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>cells.</b> One <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> was only pulsed with 500 μmol/ml of sucrose (S group). <b>The</b> second <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> was pulsed with 500 μmol/ml sucrose and 2. 5 mg/ml P. olivaceous extract (P group). <b>The</b> third <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> was pulsed with 500 μmol/ml sucrose, 230 mg/L sodium fluoride and 0. 2 % chlorohexidine digluconate (C group). During the course of carbohydrate supplement, the pH of the S group dropped sharply compared with the others. The P group demonstrated pH recovery to baseline more easily than the S group (p < 0. 05). The C group demonstrated very little pH drop. The P group displayed a lower level of colonization than the S group, which was reflected by a lower cariogenic bacterial count and a less compact biofilm especially after the third pulse. P. olivaceous suppresses bacteria growth and accelerates pH recovery. P. olivaceous may have stabilizing effect against cariogenic shift on the oral biofilm, preventing tooth decay. © 2009 Academic Journals. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
