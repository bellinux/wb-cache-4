25|$|Although {{individual}} members of Congress {{have every right to}} express their views and the views of their constituents with respect to their religious beliefs and principles and their personal standards of who may marry whom, this court cannot conclude <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> entitled to solemnize such views in the laws of this nation in disregard of the views, legal status and living arrangements of a significant segment of our citizenry that includes the Debtors in this case. To do so violates the Debtors' right to equal protection of those laws embodied in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. This court cannot conclude from the evidence or the record in this case that any valid governmental interest is advanced by DOMA as applied to the Debtors.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of Congress on the presidency has varied from period to period depending on {{factors such as}} congressional leadership, presidential political influence, historical circumstances such as war, and individual initiative by members of Congress. The impeachment of Andrew Johnson made the presidency less powerful than Congress for a considerable period afterwards. The 20th and 21st centuries have seen the rise of presidential power under politicians such as Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush. However, in recent years, Congress has restricted presidential power with laws such as the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the War Powers Resolution. Nevertheless, the Presidency remains considerably more powerful today than during the 19th century. Executive branch officials are often loath to reveal sensitive information to members of Congress because of concern that information could not be kept secret; in return, knowing they {{may be in the}} dark about executive branch activity, congressional officials are more likely to distrust their counterparts in executive agencies. Many government actions require fast coordinated effort by many agencies, and this is a task <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> ill-suited for. Congress is slow, open, divided, and not well matched to handle more rapid executive action or {{do a good job of}} overseeing such activity, according to one analysis.|$|E
500|$|Negro citizens, North and South, who {{saw in the}} Thirteenth Amendment {{a promise}} of freedom—freedom to [...] "go and come at pleasure" [...] and to [...] "buy and sell when they please"—would be left with [...] "a mere paper guarantee" [...] if Congress were {{powerless}} to assure that a dollar {{in the hands of}} a Negro will purchase the same thing as a dollar {{in the hands of a}} white man. At the very least, the freedom <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> empowered to secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the right to live wherever a white man can live. If Congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much, then the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation cannot keep.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{commentators}} {{take for}} granted that the leaderless, weak, slow, and small-committee driven, Continental <b>Congress</b> <b>was</b> a failure, largely because {{after the end of}} the war the Articles of Confederation no longer suited the needs of a peacetime nation, and the Congress itself, following Madison's recommendations, called for its revision and replacement. Some also suggest <b>that</b> the <b>Congress</b> <b>was</b> inhibited by the formation of contentious partisan alignments based on regional differences. Others claim <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>was</b> less ideological than event driven. [...] Others note <b>that</b> the <b>Congress</b> <b>was</b> successful in <b>that</b> the American people [...] "came to accept Congress as their legitimate institution of Government", but the [...] "rather poor governmental record" [...] of the Congress forced the constitutional convention of 1787.|$|R

500|$|It is {{possible}} that Congress would have to approve the NPVIC before it could go into effect. Article I, Section 10 of the US Constitution states that: [...] "No State shall, without the Consent of Congress ... enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power." [...] However, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in Virginia v. Tennessee, , and in several more recent cases, that such consent is not necessary except where a compact encroaches on federal supremacy. Every Vote Equal argues that the compact could never encroach upon federal power since the Constitution explicitly gives the power of casting electoral votes to the states, not the federal government. Derek Muller argues that the NPVIC would nonetheless affect the federal system {{in such a way}} that it would require Congressional approval, while Ian Drake argues <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> actually prohibited under the Constitution from granting approval to the NPVIC. NPVIC supporters dispute this conclusion and state they plan to seek congressional approval if the compact is approved by a sufficient number of states.|$|E

2500|$|The Court found <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> {{the whole}} body of {{initially}} candidate members who have been elected {{by the laws of}} the several states (in and for each state’s apportioned congressional districts), who assemble at the seat of the federal government on the 3rd day of January after the preceding November’s congressional elections. On that date, they are sworn in by their individual oaths of office and thereby collectively become the Nth Congress (89th, 95th, 105th, ...).|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the text}} closely, the Court {{observed}} that, since {{none of the}} numbered subsections can stand by itself as defining a crime, neither can the first paragraph. [...] "In isolation, it would merely describe some very obnoxious behavior, leaving any reader assuming {{that it must be}} a crime, but never being actually told that it is. [...] Only the numbered subsidiary provisions complete the thought." [...] Even so, such a close reading of the statutory text only helps to infer congressional intent. [...] "If a given statute is unclear about treating... a fact as element or penalty aggravator, it makes sense to look at what other statutes have done, on the fair assumption <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> unlikely to intend any radical departures from past practice without making a point of saying so." ...|$|E
2500|$|The rough-and-tumble {{world of}} legislating is not orderly and civil, human frailties too often taint its membership, and {{legislative}} outcomes are often frustrating and ineffective ... Still, {{we are not}} exaggerating when we say <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> essential to American democracy. We would not have survived as a nation without a Congress that represented the diverse interests of our society, conducted a public debate on the major issues, found compromises to resolve conflicts peacefully, and limited the power of our executive, military, and judicial institutions ... The popularity of Congress ebbs and flows with the public's confidence in government generally ... the legislative process is easy to dislike—it often generates political posturing and grandstanding, it necessarily involves compromise, and it often leaves broken promises in its trail. Also, members of Congress often appear self-serving as they pursue their political careers and represent interests and reflect values that are controversial. Scandals, even when they involve a single member, add to the public's frustration with Congress and {{have contributed to the}} institution's low ratings in opinion polls.—Smith, Roberts & Wielen ...|$|E

50|$|The Court's {{conclusion}} is also supported by another consideration. The defendant's {{interpretation of the}} statute would remove from the statute any coverage of the conduct <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> specifically intended to prohibit.

Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), a ranking member of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ("House Intelligence Committee"). Ruppersberger, who was a guest on the show, responded, [...] "We have rules {{as far as the}} committee and what you can have and what you cannot have. However, based on that, that statement I just made, is that since this incident occurred with Snowden, we've had three different hearings for members of our Democratic Caucus, and the Republican Caucus.... And we will continue to do that because what we're trying to do now is to get the American public to know more about what's going on." [...] Rep. King, who was also a guest on This Week as a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, stated: [...] "o me it's unprecedented to have all of these top people from an administration during this time of crisis still come in and answer question after question after question. So anyone who says <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> somehow being stonewalled is just wrong and [...] is generally, I think, raised by {{people who are trying to}} make a name for themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{this book}} was commenced, it was {{generally}} supposed that the Mexican war would end, {{after a few months}} of hostilities. Such was never the opinion of the writer. He has ever looked forward to a protracted struggle; and, now that Congress has begun to interfere, sees as little probability of its termination, as on the day it commenced. Whence honourable gentlemen have derived their notions of the constitution, when they advance the doctrine <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> an American Aulic council, empowered to encumber the movements of armies, and, as old Blucher expressed it in reference to the diplomacy of Europe, [...] "to spoil with the pen the work achieved by the sword," [...] it is difficult to say more than this, that they do not get them from the constitution itself. It has generally been supposed that the present executive was created {{in order to avoid the}} very evils of a distracted and divided council, which this new construction has a direct tendency to revive. But a presidential election has ever proved, and probably will ever prove, stronger than any written fundamental law.|$|E

2500|$|Dissenting this time, Blackmun {{read the}} conference report differently.

[...] "he fact that this statement [...] was made in an amendment to the Exchange Act suggests <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>was</b> aware of the extension of Wilko to [...] claims," [...] Blackmun argued. [...] "Although the remark does not necessarily signify Congress' endorsement of this extension, {{in the absence of any}} prior congressional indication to the contrary, it implies <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>was</b> not concerned with arresting this trend. Such inaction during a wholesale revision of the securities laws, a revision designed to further investor protection, would argue in favor of Congress' approval of Wilko and its extension to [...] claims." ...|$|R
