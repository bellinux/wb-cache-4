40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{examination}} of <b>extrusion</b> <b>coating</b> product performance, which is aspired to improve with resin choice and essential process parameters such as melt temperature and air gap distance. The performance is defined via two main testing methods, which are hot air sealing and pinhole measurements. Furthermore, infrared (IR) thermometry is applied to monitor the polymer film temperature during processing and contribute the conclusions of the laboratory measurement results. Theoretical part presents essential information about polymer material, <b>extrusion</b> <b>coating</b> process and parameters, product properties and fundamentals of IR thermometry. Firstly, the structure, properties and polymerization of polyethylene are discussed, followed by the principles of <b>extrusion</b> <b>coating</b> process. The knowledge of <b>extrusion</b> <b>coating</b> is reinforced with process parameters and their influence is considered via product properties. Finally, IR thermometry is examined including theoretical basis, equipment introduction and measurement method. Experimental part includes trial runs to produce product samples and laboratory measurements that focus on the quality control. Experiments concentrate on three main variables; melt temperature, air gap and resin choice, which are adjusted through the measurements. Hot air sealing and pinhole analyses are performed after each trial run in order to monitor the product quality and discover optimal process conditions for every material. The ultimate goal is to examine combination of melt temperature, air gap distance and material, which produces the best possible hot air sealing and pinhole results with the lowest possible coating weight. The measurements of experimental part offer a few confirmed outcomes, which enable conclusions concerning optimal melt temperature and air gap settings. Furthermore, comparison between different resin choices is possible. Higher melt temperature setting mainly improves hot air sealing and pinhole results. However, some resins does not endure excessive heating and degradation and the properties start to decline. The effect of air gap is similar to the melt temperature. Higher air gap setting decreases sealing temperature and reduces pinholes almost invariably despite increased cooling of the film. Moreover, increased neck-in must be noticed as the advantages of higher air gap are considered. The comparison of resin choice produce the most controversial results and the effect of blending is partially indefinite. First set of measurements support the blending in order to improve hot air sealing and pinhole results, but the advantage is disappeared in subsequent examination. Furthermore, increased material cost do not support the use of blends...|$|R

40|$|Low-density {{polyethylene}} (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP) {{are widely}} used polymers in packaging industry. These polymers differ to one and other by their polymer structures: LPDE has long branched body, when PP is a linear polymer. Branched structure gives LDPE flexibility that PP lacks due to its high level of crystallization. The aim {{of this research was}} to compare these polymers in <b>extrusion</b> <b>coating</b> and find out if there are certain procedures in surface treatments that could improve PP’s properties in post-coating stage. For instance PP has high melting temperature and low surface energy that prevents its use in <b>extrusion</b> <b>coating.</b> In <b>extrusion</b> <b>coating</b> a thin film of the molten polymer is extruded though a flat tie and then pressed towards the substrate. The substrate in this study was paper and the studied treatments were flame, corona, and plasma focusing on heat sealing, hot tack, surface energy and water vapour transmission (WVTR). The study was divided into four different case studies: 1. The effect of flame treatment, 2. The barrier effect of plasma and corona, 3. The effect of the treatment combination, 4. The influence of time and conditions. In the results, it was shown that PP has better water vapour transfer resistance throughout the study points and in comparison to LDPE it also reacted more on the surface treatments in case of WVTR. LDPE had higher surface energy in nearly every study point despite the surface treatment and its reaction on treatments was greater. LDPE’s and PP’s heat sealability temperatures were relatively close to each other in treated study points, though LDPE’s reference value was remarkably lower. If flame treatment is combined with plasma or corona, the best results for both used polymers took place in the treatment order where the flame treatment was performed first: sealing temperature, surface energy and WVTR enhanced. In the study of time condition contact angles grow in logarithmic scale in both studied polymers and the highest growth happens in hotter and humid conditions. LDPE’s and PP’s sealing temperatures follow relatively similar curve in function of time. /Kir 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{intensive}} {{research has been}} carried out in order to replace oil-based polymers with bio-based polymers due to growing environmental concerns. So far, most of the barrier materials used in food packaging are petroleum-based materials. The purpose of the barrier is to protect the packaged food from oxygen, water vapour, water and fat. The mechanical and barrier properties of coatings based on starch-plasticizer and starch-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) -plasticizer blends have been studied in the work described in this thesis. The plasticizers used were glycerol, polyethylene glycol and citric acid. In a second step, polyethylene coatings were extruded onto paperboard pre-coated with a starch-PVOH-plasticizer blend. The addition of PVOH to the starch increased the flexibility of the film. Curing of the film led to a decrease in flexibility and an increase in tensile strength. The flexibility of the starch-PVOH films was increased more when glycerol or polyethylene glycol was added than citric acid. The storage modulus of the starch-PVOH films containing citric acid increased substantially at high temperature. It was seen that the addition of polyethylene glycol or citric acid to the starch-PVOH blend resulted in an enrichment of PVOH at the surface of the films. Tensile tests on the films indicated that citric acid acted as a compatibilizer and increased the compatibility of the starch and PVOH in the blend. The addition of citric acid to the coating recipe substantially decreased the water vapour transmission rate through the starch-PVOH coated paperboard, which indicated that citric acid acts as a cross-linker for starch and/or PVOH. The starch-PVOH coatings containing citric acid showed oxygen-barrier properties similar to those of pure PVOH or of a starch-PVOH blend without plasticizer when four coating layers were applied on a paperboard. The oxygen-barrier properties of coatings based on a starch-PVOH blend containing citric acid indicated a cross-linking and increase in compatibility of the starch-PVOH blends. Polyethylene <b>extrusion</b> <b>coating</b> on a pre-coated paperboard resulted in a clear reduction in the oxygen transmission rate for all the pre-coating formulations containing plasticizers. The addition of a plasticizer to the pre-coating reduced the adhesion of polyethylene to pre-coated board. Polyethylene <b>extrusion</b> <b>coating</b> gave a board with a lower oxygen transmission rate when the paperboard was pre-coated with a polyethylene-glycol-containing formulation than with a citric-acid-containing formulation. The addition of polyethylene glycol to pre-coatings indicated an increase in wetting of the pre-coated paperboard by the polyethylene melt, and this may have sealed the small defects in the pre-coating leading to low oxygen transmission rate. The increase in brittleness of starch-PVOH films containing citric acid at a high temperature seemed to have a dominating effect on the barrier properties developed by the <b>extrusion</b> <b>coating</b> process.  Over the last few decades, industry and academia have made joint efforts to generate knowledge about renewable barrier materials in order to replace the oil-based barrier materials currently used in food packaging. This work has focused on the possibility of producing a material with high oxygen barrier properties including polyethylene as a moisture protection. The flexibility of starch films was increased by adding poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) to the starch and the addition of a plasticizer to the starch-PVOH blend films further increase the flexibility of the films. The plasticizers used were glycerol, polyethylene glycol and citric acid. Curing of the films reduce their flexibility. The addition of citric acid to a starch-PVOH blend increased the compatibility of the starch-PVOH blend and affected the barrier properties of the coating layers containing citric acid. When a sufficient number of coating layers was applied, the starch-PVOH-citric-acid coatings showed oxygen-transmission-rate-values {{similar to those of the}} pure PVOH and of the starch-PVOH blend without plasticizers.
