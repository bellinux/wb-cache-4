This fuzzy TILC is based on the inverse of a fuzzy model of this machine, and is built from experimental (or simulation) data with kriging interpolation. The Fuzzy Inference System usually used for a fuzzy model is the zero order Takagi Sugeno Kwan system (constant consequents). In this paper, the 1 st order Takagi Sugeno Kwan system is used, with the fuzzy model rules expressed using matrices. This makes the inversion of the fuzzy model much easier than the inversion of the fuzzy model based on the TSK of order 0. Based on simulation results, the proposed fuzzy TILC seems able to give a very good initial guess as to the heater <b>temperature</b> <b>setpoints,</b> making it possible to have almost no wastage of plastic sheets.

2500|$|Thermostats use {{different}} types of sensors to measure the temperature. In one form, the mechanical thermostat, a bimetallic strip {{in the form of}} a coil directly operates electrical contacts that control the heating or cooling source. Electronic thermostats, instead, use a thermistor or other semiconductor sensor that requires amplification and processing to control the heating or cooling equipment (or even both, through the use of relays). A thermostat is an example of a [...] "bang-bang controller" [...] as the heating or cooling equipment output is not proportional to the difference between actual temperature and the <b>temperature</b> <b>setpoint.</b> Instead, the heating or cooling equipment runs at full capacity until the set temperature is reached, then shuts off. Increasing the difference between the thermostat setting and the desired temperature therefore does not change the time to achieve the desired temperature. The rate at which the target system temperature can change is determined both by the capacity of the heating or cooling equipment to respectively add or remove heat to or from a target system and the capacity of the target system to store heat.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objectives}} were: (1) to develop tools {{to aid in}} the design of enclosed agro-ecosystems, and (2) to use these tools to develop a prototype simulation-based control system. Three tools were developed: (1) a conceptual framework, (2) a (simulated) greenhouse system and (3) a simulation approach within OS/ 2. Part of the conceptual framework was dedicated to "conscious control", defined as a form of control practised by an entity that uses models of itself in its decision-making processes. The greenhouse system was composed of six modules (a simulation manager, a weather generator, a greenhouse model, a crop model, a Pavlovian controller and a cognitive controller), which were implemented under OS/ 2 as separate processes. The greenhouse system was used to develop a prototype simulation-based controller. Primarily, the role of the controller was to determine <b>temperature</b> <b>setpoints</b> that would minimize the heating load. The simulation model used by the controller was an artificial neural network. The controller adapted <b>temperature</b> <b>setpoints</b> to anticipated meteorological conditions and reduced greenhouse energy consumption, in comparison with a more traditional controller.

One of the major design problems in multiple application domains is the mismatch between workloads and resources. Sub-optimal assignment of workloads to resources can cause underloaded or overloaded resources, resulting in performance degradation or energy waste. This work specifically focuses on the heterogeneity in system hardware components and workloads. It includes energy management solutions for unregulated or batteryless embedded systems; and data center servers with heterogeneous workloads, machines, and processor wear states. This thesis describes four major contributions: (1) This thesis describes a battery test and energy delivery system design process to maintain battery life in embedded systems without voltage regulators. (2) In battery-less sensor nodes, this thesis demonstrates a routing protocol to maintain reliable transmission through the sensor network. (3) This thesis has characterized typical workloads and developed two models to capture the heterogeneity of data center tasks and machines: a task performance model and a machine resource utilization model. These models allow users to predict task finish time on individual machines. It then integrates these two models into a task scheduler based on the Hadoop framework for MapReduce tasks, and uses this scheduler for server energy minimization using task concentration.
