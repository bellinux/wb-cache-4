5|$|At the Grey Cup level, the Argonauts {{have faced}} an {{assortment}} of teams in recent decades rather <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> team regularly. The Edmonton Eskimos, for years a dominant team in the league, became a rival. The two teams' five Grey Cup match-ups include an epic 38–36 Toronto loss in 1987 and most recently, the Snow Bowl victory in 1996 led by the arm of Doug Flutie. In the pre-CFL days, the Argos had a Grey Cup rivalry with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and a cross-town rivalry with the University of Toronto {{in the first years}} of the Grey Cup championship, including the Argonauts' first win in 1914.|$|E

25|$|Other {{factors which}} {{may have contributed to}} the decline of the water {{hyacinth}} in Lake Victoria include varying weather patterns, such as El Niño during the last few months of 1997 and first six months of 1998 bringing with it higher levels of water in the lake and thus dislodging the plants. Heavy winds and rains along with their subsequent waves may have also damaged the plants during this same time frame. The plants may not have been destroyed, instead merely moved to another location. Additionally, the water quality, nutrient supply, temperature, and other environmental factors could have played a role. Overall, the timing of the decline could be linked to all of these factors and perhaps together, in combination, they were more effective <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> deterrent would have been by itself. The water hyacinth is in remission and this trend could be permanent if control efforts are continued.|$|E

25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held on Thursday morning, lasted 45 minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning. Alex Lynn set the fastest time for Theodore Racing by Prema in the opening practice session—held in variable weather conditions—with a lap of two minutes and 14.495 seconds, 0.061 seconds faster <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> else at the track. His closest challenger was Félix da Costa in second in front of third-placed Coletti and Mücke Motorsport's Felix Rosenqvist in fourth position. Alexander Sims was fifth-fastest, ahead of Jaafar. Tom Blomqvist, Marciello, Lucas Auer and Korjus rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Sainz {{was the first of}} the drivers to go off the track in wet conditions and rebounded off the Fisherman's Corner barriers with his car's rear-end. His teammate King understeered into the same barrier eleven minutes later, while Rosenqvist crashed at San Francisco Bend on dirty tyres due to him running wide at Lisboa turn. Three other drivers—Sekiguchi, Lucas Wolf and Sun Zheng—failed to record a lap time as a consequence of encountering incidents during the session.|$|E
25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held on Thursday morning, lasted thirty minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning. Grosjean set the fastest time for ASM in the opening practice session with a late lap of two minutes and 14.223 seconds, nearly one-tenth of a second faster <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> else on the circuit in spite of heavily damaging his car's left-hand side {{in order to avoid}} Stephen Jelley's stricken vehicle at Policeman's Bend. His closest challenger was Sébastien Buemi in second in front of third-placed Asmer and Prema Powerteam's Roberto Streit in fourth. Koudai Tsukakoshi was fifth-fastest, ahead of Edoardo Mortara in sixth. Oliver Jarvis, Jelley, Senna and Nico Hülkenberg rounded out the session's top ten drivers. The session was stopped halfway through when Franck Mailleux spun into the barriers lining the track at the R Bend and this caused his car to be stranded on track. Other incidents included Lei spinning at Lisboa corner but avoided damaging his car with Sam Bird later swiping the turn's wall and Walter Grubmüller limped to the pit lane with his front-right suspension bent.|$|E
25|$|One {{practice}} session lasting {{half an hour}} was held on Thursday before the two races. Leimer for Racing Engineering set a benchmark which was the fastest time in the sole {{practice session}}—held in variable weather conditions and warm track temperatures—with a lap of one minute and 41.361 seconds on the hard compound tyres, one second faster <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> else on the track. His closest challenger was Sam Bird in second in front of third-placed Coletti and Rossi in fourth position. Marcus Ericsson was fifth-fastest, ahead of Nasr. Calado was seventh-fastest, Tom Dillmann eighth, Johnny Cecotto Jr. ninth and Daniel Abt completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Frijns spun early on but recovered without needing external assistance. Smoke bellowed out of Cecotto's car while driving at high-speed and later locked his tyres at the first corner before overshooting into the sand. Julián Leal stalled at the exit of the pit lane and {{this led to a}} stewards investigation over whether his team's mechanics restarted the car outside of the limits of the pit lane. Leal then narrowly avoided running into the rear-end of Rossi's car.|$|E

25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held on Thursday morning, lasted 45 minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning. Lucas Auer set the fastest time for Theodore Racing by Prema in the opening practice session—which was delayed for one hour to facilitate barrier repairs at Police corner following a support race crash —with a lap of two minutes and 14.645 seconds. 0.055 seconds faster <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> else at the track. His closest challenger was Antonio Giovinazzi ahead of teammate Tom Blomqvist and Buller. Jordan King was fifth-fastest, in front of Felix Rosenqvist. Max Verstappen, Nicholas Latifi, Coletti and Sean Gelael rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Gelael and Cao made contact at Lisboa corner and Sam MacLeod crashed into the barriers at Police corner. Wells spun into the wall at Fisherman's bend with Mitsunori Takaboshi caused the session to be stopped by hitting the Moorish Hill turn barrier. Ocon was caught off guard by the accident and damaged his left-front suspension by swiping Takaboshi's car. Spike Goddard impacted the Moorish Hill corner wall in the session's closing minutes which prevented anyone from improving on their quickest lap times.|$|E
25|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held on Friday evening, lasted {{for half an}} hour, with sim drivers taking part, and the second identically timed session for the professional racing drivers was held fifteen minutes later. The two final sessions for sim and professional drivers took place on Saturday morning and both ran for fifteen minutes. Bono Huis set the fastest time for Dragon in the combined opening practice session {{with a time of}} one minute and 28.456 seconds, half a second faster <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> else. His closest challenger was the highest placed professional driver Felix Rosenqvist in second in front of third-placed Graham Carroll and Virgin's José María López in fourth. Piquet was fifth-fastest, ahead of António Félix da Costa in sixth. Sam Bird, Enzo Bonito, Olli Pahkala and Frijns rounded out the session's top ten fastest drivers. In the second practice session, Huis again topped the combined time sheets with a lap of one minute and 28.142 seconds, more than half a second quicker than second-placed Frijns and Rosenqvist finished third. Félix da Costa was fourth-quickest; Petar Brljak was fifth and Graham Carroll sixth. Pahkala placed seventh, Bonito eighth, David Greco ninth and López completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E

500|$|The French {{masters of}} the method and their imitators in other {{countries}} confined their attention {{for the most part}} to an exploitation of the possibilities afforded by {{the upper reaches of the}} orchestral register, and to the attainment, principally, of effects of brilliance and luminosity. Debussy's writing for the lower instruments, and for the double-bases in particular, is as a general rule timid and conventional in comparison with his treatment of the higher instruments, as a result, doubtless, of his exaggerated fear of thickness of texture. In The Oceanides Sibelius has explored the lower depths of the orchestra more thoroughly <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> had previously done, and applied the impressionist method of scoring to the bass instruments, thereby achieving effects of sonority hitherto unknown.|$|E

By late June, Drake was home in Nashville producing Ringo Starr's second solo album, Beaucoups of Blues (1970), the recording of which, author Bob Woffinden suggested in 1981, [...] "was probably completed more quickly <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> of the tracks on All Things Must Pass". Part of the reason for Harrison taking so long to make his album was the interruption to recording caused by his frequent visits to Liverpool's neurological hospital, where his mother was dying of cancer.

500|$|The rise of {{the motor}} vehicle era in the early 20th century saw the road gain {{prominence}} once more.

To increase the usability of the overall main road network, the Board's work schedule prioritised upgrading the worst individual segments, rather <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> road. In 1928/29, twenty-two separate sections of the Perth–Albany road were improved, but many were short, and drivers would experience quite varied conditions, from new sealed road to gravel road, and then a boggy dirt in just a few miles.
