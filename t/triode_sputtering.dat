A linear relationship was observed between the AlN lattice parameter "c" (perpendicular to the substrate surface) and the in-plane compressive stress.

The measurements of these essential SAW properties for the frequency range between 180 and 360 MHz have been performed using a knife-edge laser probe for film thicknesses over the range of 1. 6 - 4 micron and with films or different grain sizes. The high quality of dc <b>triode</b> <b>sputtered</b> films was observed as evidenced by high K(exp 2) and low attenuation.

It was found that near the propagation direction, the focusing SAW property of the bare GaAs changes into a nonfocusing one for the layered structure, but a reversed phenomenon exists near the direction. Furthermore, to some extent the diffraction of the substrate can be controlled with the film thickness. The reflectivity of shorted and open gratings are also analyzed and measured.

Analysis of these data determined that the dopant energy levels had created a band which merged with the conduction band. The characteristics of this merged band structure controlled the free carrier concentration.

The resistivity of the n-type films at room temperature ranged from 0. 036 Ohm-cm to 20. 8 k Ohm-cm. The most important mobility limitations were found to be ionized impurity scattering from the high doping densities and grain boundary scattering from the film disorder.

Strong changes in the spin-dependent scattering are found in samples with in-plane diameter below 30 nm. This behavior {{is due to a}} low-temperature spin freezing of the island boundary magnetic regions, producing a suppression of the exchange coupling between islands. A consequence of the magnetic decoupling is the random arrangement of the individual magnetization, determined by the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of each island, that results in a spin-dependent induced increase of the resistivity below the freezing temperature. By applying a high enough magnetic field, magnetic ordering recovers regardless of the temperature, obtaining a typical metallic behavior for the thermal dependence of the resistivity. The ratio of the low-temperature resistivities with and without magnetic field yields magnetoresistance values up to 5. 5 % for 16. 5 nm in-plane island sizes. The following two conclusions are obtained: (i) nanocrystalline Fe can be considered as a low-temperature GMR-like system and (ii) Fe grain boundaries are not ferromagnetic at low temperature but behave as a reentrant spin-glass system.

40|$|Wear {{behavior}} of coatings has usually {{been described in}} terms of mechanical properties such as hardness (H) and effective elastic modulus (E*). Alternatively, an energy approach appears as a promising analysis taking into account the influence of those properties. In a nanoindentation test, the dissipated energy depends not only on the hardness and elastic modulus, but also on the elastic recovery (W(e)). This work aims to establish a relation between plastic deformation energy (E(p)) during depth-sensing indentation method and the grooving resistance of coatings in nanoscratch tests. An energy dissipation coefficient (K(d)) was defined, calculated as the ratio of the plastic to the total deformation energy (E(p) /E(t)), which represents the energy dissipation of materials.

Morphological and structural {{studies show that the}} nanoparticles grow in a well-defined nanostructured pattern and adopt a hexagonal closed packed crystalline structure. Moreover, the average particle size and the particle size dispersion increase as the thickness increases, due to percolation. Experimental characterization of effective anisotropy field was carried out with transverse susceptibility. Transverse susceptibility measurements reveal an in-plane isotropic magnetic behavior. Both the effective anisotropy field and the coercive field increase as the particle size increases, following a D 6 dependence, which is typical for three-dimensional structures in the framework of the random anisotropy model. The relationship between the particle size distribution and the anisotropy field distribution is shown, explaining the significant dependence of the magnetic behavior on the Co layer thickness.

Major problems in this application concern the wear of the coatings due to interactions with the hot glass and particularly the damage by stresses induced in the coatings by temperature varying from room temperature to the service temperature ranging up to 800 K and even higher. In the present study coatings of the Ti-Al-N system were deposited on steel, fused silica and silicon substrates in reactive sputtering processes by variation of the process parameters such as total pressure, substrate temperature, discharge power and distance between target and substrate.

Research groups {{use a variety of}} processes to fabricate thin-film CdS/CdTe cells, including physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and RF diode sputtering. One of the central areas of investigation concerning CdS/CdTe cells is the problem of a Schottky barrier at the back contact. Even cells fabricated with ohmic back contacts degrade into Schottky barriers as the devices are used. This severely degrades power generation. One possible solution is to use p+-ZnTe as an interlayer between CdTe and the back contact. ZnTe is easily doped with Cu to be p-type. However, even contacts with this ZnTe interlayer degrade over time, because Cu is highly mobile and diffuses away from the contact towards the CdS/CdTe junction. Another possibility is to dope ZnTe with N. It has been demonstrated using molecular beam epitaxy and RF diode sputtering.;In this study, CdTe films are fabricated using a variation of RF diode sputtering called <b>triode</b> <b>sputtering.</b> This technique allows for control of ion bombardment to the substrate during deposition. Also, a higher plasma density near the target is achieved allowing depositions at lower pressures. These films are characterized structurally to show the effects of the various deposition parameters.;N-doped ZnTe films are also fabricated using this technique. These films are characterized electrically to show the effects of the various deposition parameters. Also, the effects of post-deposition annealing are observed. It is found that annealing at the right temperature can increase the conductivity of the films by a factor of 3 or more. However, annealing at higher temperatures decreases the conductivity to as low as 12 % of the initial conductivity.;Finally, RF triode sputtered N-doped ZnTe films are used as an interlayer at the back contact of a CdS/CdTe solar cell. The effects of annealing the device before and after contact deposition are observed. Annealing before depositing contacts results in an increase in Voc of 20 mV. Annealing after contact deposition results in a degradation of fill factor over time...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{films of}} barium {{titanium}} silicate (Ba 2 Si 2 TiO 8) are grown on crystalline (100) Si at substrate temperatures raging from 750 to 955 ∘C by the radio-frequency <b>triode</b> <b>sputtering</b> technique. The chemical composition, microstructure, physical properties, and growth {{conditions of the}} deposited films are investigated by dc and high-frequency dielectric measurements, wavelength dispersive and energy dispersive x-ray spectrometries, x-ray diffraction spectrometry, and optical and scanning electron microscopies. The results of the x-ray diffraction analysis show that the Ba 2 Si 2 TiO 8 films deposited at the optimum condition of substrate temperature of 845 ∘C, 4 cm source-substance distance, 50 W rf power, and 1. 2 × 10 - 3 torr pressure of Ar, are highly c-axis oriented. The as-deposited films are smooth, glossy, polycrystalline films, exhibiting a bulk resistivity range of 106 Ω·cm, and an isotropic surface resistivity of 1. 5 × 103 Ω·cm. The relative dielectric constant is 0. 05, and the dielectric loss is lower than 1. 0, in the frequency band 9 ∼ 1000 MHz. The high-frequency impedance of BST films, which is typical for piezoelectric materials, gives a minimum impedance frequency of 9. 0 MHz and a series resonant frequency of 9. 5 MHz. Optical and SEM observations show that the film texture {{is dependent on the}} substrate conditions. The non-liquid-like grain coalescence of the Ba 2 Si 2 TiO 8 grains is characteristic of a strong film-substrate interaction. The grain growth kinetics obtained from 2 ̆ 2 short-time 2 ̆ 2 sputtering gives an initial lateral grain growth rate of 770 nm/min at 845 ∘C, which decreases with the grain size. The initial film growth rate in the direction of thickness, measured from SEM micrographs, is 1. 95 nm/min, and decreases with sputtering time. The activation free energy for grain growth is 359 ± 30 KJ/mol for the initial stage, decreasing to 148 ± 20 KJ/mol for the final stage. The variation of the grain growth rate and the activation energy with grain size {{is the result of a}} combined nucleation and growth mechanism in the initial stage of the film growth, and a coalescence-dominated growth mechanism at longer sputtering time and at higher temperature. Film orientation is sensitive to the supersaturation adjacent to the film surface, which depends on the source-substrate distance and substrate temperature. The effect of the substrate temperature on the orientation of the film is investigated over a wide temperature range using (100) and (111) Si substrates. Several orientations for the BST films, including an amorphous state, are obtained with increasing substrate temperature. This is discussed in relation to the atomic plane density and the energetics for the deposition process. Dept. of Mechanical, Automotive, and Materials Engineering.
