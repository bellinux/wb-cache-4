This paper compares trap-driven simulation, as implemented in <b>Tapeworm,</b> with the more common technique of trace-driven memory simulation with respect to speed, accuracy, portability and flexibility. Results: For reasonable miss ratios, <b>Tapeworm</b> simulations are significantly faster than traditional trace-driven simulations. <b>Tapeworm</b> typically slows a system down by less than {{an order of magnitude}} (10 x) when cache miss ratios are under 10 %, and slowdowns approach zero as miss ratios decrease. <b>Tapeworm</b> can employ set sampling techniques to further reduce slowdowns, but at the expense of higher measurement variance. Unlike tracedriven simulations, which typically produce identical results from run to run, trap-driven simulations exhibit greater sensitivity to inherent variations in memory system behavior on a real machine. Less than 5 % of <b>Tapeworm’s</b> code is machine-dependent, enhancing its portability to different machines provided that they support a few essential primitive operations. Although the trap-driven approach is flexible enough to simulate most TLB and cache configurations, other architectural structures, such as write buffers or instruction pipelines cannot be simulated with this approach. <b>Tapeworm</b> implementations currently exist for TLB and instruction cache simulation on MIPS-based DECstations and for TLB simulation on a 486 -based Gateway PC...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTapeworms are {{pervasive}} and globally distributed parasites that infect millions {{of humans and}} livestock every year, and are the causative agents {{of two of the}} 17 neglected tropical diseases prioritized by the World Health Organization. Studies of <b>tapeworm</b> biology and pathology are often encumbered by the complex life cycles of disease-relevant <b>tapeworm</b> species that infect hosts such as foxes, dogs, cattle, pigs, and humans. Thus, studies of laboratory models can help overcome the practical, ethical, and cost-related difficulties faced by <b>tapeworm</b> parasitologists. The rat intestinal <b>tapeworm</b> Hymenolepis diminuta is easily reared in the laboratory and has the potential to enable modern molecular-based experiments that will greatly contribute to our understanding of multiple aspects of <b>tapeworm</b> biology, such as growth and reproduction. As part of our efforts to develop molecular tools for experiments on H. diminuta, we have characterized a battery of lectins, antibodies, and common stains that label different <b>tapeworm</b> tissues and organ structures. Using confocal microscopy, we have assembled an “atlas” of H. diminuta organ architecture that will be a useful resource for helminthologists.
