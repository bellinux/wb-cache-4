US12 replaced US112 in 1962 when the I-94 designation supplanted most of the original US12. Later that year, US16 was decommissioned in favor of I-96. <b>This</b> <b>trend</b> continued into the 1970s when US25 was decommissioned as redundant to sections of I-75 and I-94.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{the number}} of {{supporters}} rose, and by the early 1960s this number had increased to highs of 12,000.

5|$|Along with rapid promotion, the war also noticeably {{lowered the}} age of {{battalion}} commanding officers. In 1914, they were aged over 50, while the average age for a battalion commanding officer in the BEF between 1917 and 1918 was 28. By this stage, it was official policy that men over 35 were no longer eligible to command battalions. <b>This</b> <b>trend</b> was reflected amongst the junior officers. Anthony Eden was the Adjutant of a battalion when aged 18, and served as the Brigade Major in the 198th Brigade while still only aged 20.|$|E

40|$|<b>This</b> <b>Trends</b> and Issues is {{the first}} in a series that will focus {{specifically}} on women's issues in crime and criminal justice. The topic of premenstrual tension is a fitting, if controversial one with which to begin the series.

It continues to be a cause of controversy and dissension in both the medical and legal professions. <b>This</b> <b>Trends</b> and Issues examines the research that links PMS and deviant criminal behaviour. It also discusses possible ways that PMS could be used in the courts, and reviews its application to date as a defence strategy both in Australia and overseas.

5|$|Historians {{contend that}} for the UN and North Korea, locked in a bitter battle where neither could gain the upper hand, {{logistics}} {{was among the most}} important determining factors in how the war would progress. As the disparity in logistics capability widened between the UN and North Korean forces, the well-supported UN troops were able to hold their positions along the Pusan Perimeter, while the morale and the fighting quality of NKPA deteriorated as resupplies became increasingly unreliable. <b>This</b> <b>trend</b> ultimately culminated in the UN recapturing Seoul, the key logistics center of the battle, and the collapse of the North Korean logistics system with the entire NKPA.|$|E
5|$|Historically Bournemouth has {{suffered}} from negative rates of natural increase and has relied on immigration to maintain population growth. In 2007 however, births exceeded deaths for the first time, and <b>this</b> <b>trend</b> has continued through to 2011. This, coupled with {{a substantial increase in}} people moving into the area, has led to a sharp rise in the resident population since 2001. Of the total population, 3.3% are 85 or over, compared to 2.2% nationally; however the largest group of people moving into the area are students in the 16-24-year age group, and 9% of the current population are between 20 and 24.

5|$|In {{observing a}} {{multitude}} of biographies and funerary inscriptions, Hymes states that officials in the Northern Song era displayed a primary preoccupation with national interests, as they did not intervene in local or central government affairs {{for the benefit of}} their local prefecture or county. <b>This</b> <b>trend</b> was reversed in the Southern Song.
