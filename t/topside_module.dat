40|$|As the {{industrial}} company Kv&# 230;rner faces ever tougher competition from foreign companies, increasing productivity and reducing costs {{is essential in}} order to win contracts and be successful in the future. With regards to increasing productivity, the Kv&# 230;rner shipyard at Stord wishes to assemble the topside modules manufacture at the yard in an up-side-down position. It is expected by Kv&# 230;rner that this rationalizes the manufacturing process of the topside modules while also increasing personnel safety. Consequently, Kv&# 230;rner wants to assess the possibility of turning topside modules of up to 500 tonnes in mass up,-side-down at the shipyard. This project aims to investigate the feasibility of this idea. Starting with a broad and open perspective, creation and evaluation of ideas, applying strategies from engineering design methods leads to detailed solutions. The result is a planar steel structure, hereby denoted turning frame, onto which the <b>topside</b> <b>module</b> is mounted in the horizontal position. The turning frame acts as an intermediary structure between the crane and the <b>topside</b> <b>module.</b> The frame has lifting points at the edges onto which the ropes of the crane are connected. The lifting process is rather complicated compared with usual lifting operations. The rope forces have to stay within the capacity of the crane, all the while maintaining stability of the turning frame with the <b>topside</b> <b>module.</b> Stability is essential in order to limit unintended motion of the frame, which elicits large dynamic effects due to the mass inertia of the load. A detailed design of the turning frame is obtained and analyzed with respect to capacity toward critical load combinations. The frame is analyzed in the horizontal and vertical positions, which are deemed the critical positions. MS Excel is applied to calculate support and internal forces, as well as check of cross section capacity and capacity toward column and plate buckling. Welds are also designed and documented. The calculations are used to verify finite element models. Peak stresses in the frame are investigated using 2 D and 3 D elements. Overall, the design of the frame is deemed acceptable, given that some stress concentrations are mitigated by rounding off sharp corners. The shortcomings of the analysis of the frame are explained, and suggestions to further work are presented. With respect to the overall feasibility of the concept, there are major obstacles which must be overcome in order for the concept to be feasible. A major problem is overcoming instability of the system as the frame approaches the vertical position. As the <b>topside</b> <b>module</b> is mounted on top of the frame, the center of gravity of the module is eccentric from the plane of the frame. This eccentricity results in a moment which at the point the frame is at 90 &# 176;, must be carried by horizontal components of the rope forces alone. An optimal scheme of rope forces is presented, which can be a guideline for the crane operator. The optimal scheme ensures that the stability of the frame is maintained, as well as ?acceptable? rope forces. ?Acceptable? means that the total rope force is within the capacity of the crane, but the direction of the rope force is however not acceptable. As the moment due to the eccentricity of the <b>topside</b> <b>module</b> is carried by horizontal forces alone in the vertical position, horizontal components of the rope forces must be the equivalent of up to 111 tonnes of mass to maintain stability of the frame in the vertical position. If stability is not maintained, the frame will tip over due to the moment caused by the eccentricity of the module. Given the assumptions about the module applied in this project, the frame reaches the tipping point at roughly 70 &# 176; rotation. The horizontal forces are led to the trolleys of the crane, which are absolutely not able to carry this load. This problem must be solved in order for the concept to be feasible. Also, the topside modules must be examined thoroughly to determine whether they can withstand being lifted as proposed in this project, as there will also be internal moments in the vertical position which the modules are not designed for originally. Overall, the feasibility of the concept is considered to most likely be unacceptable, as long as the obstacles are not overcome. The students have had a challenging task in this thesis. Creative thinking as well as ability to apply understanding of mechanics of moving objects and advanced load scenarios has been crucial to the progress of the work. The students are of the opinion that the work has been interesting and a valuable experience, highly relevant for future careers. </p...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTFire is a {{continuous}} threat to FPSO <b>topside</b> <b>modules</b> as {{large amounts of}} oil and gas are passing through the modules. As a conventional measure to mitigate structural failure under fire, passive fire protection (PFP) coatings are widely used on main structural members. However, an excessive use of PFP coatings can cause considerable cost for material purchase, installation, inspection and maintenance. Long installation time can be a risk since the work should be done nearly at the last fabrication stage. Thus, the minimal use of PFP can be beneficial to the reduction of construction cost and the avoidance of schedule delay. This paper presents a few case studies on how different applications of PFP have influence on collapse time of a FPSO module structure. A series of heat analysis and thermal elasto-plastic FE analysis are performed for different PFP coatings and the resultant collapse time and the amount of PFP coatings are compared with each other...|$|R

40|$|The {{size and}} {{production}} capacity of Floating Production, Storage and Offloading units, or FPSOs, is ever growing. SBM Offshore specialized in converting existing oil tankers into FPSOs. One {{of the limitations}} they found was the available deck space for the <b>topsides</b> <b>modules.</b> A new concept was proposed to solve this problem: a twin hull FPSO, made of two tanker hulls connected side to side by a slim, rigid structure. An initial study done by SBM suggested the transverse bulkheads were the most critical components, failing on shear stress. The main question addressed in this thesis is: How does the twin hull structure behave and is it strong enough? To answer this, a finite element twin hull and mono hull model was created containing only the main structural components. To avoid extensive modelling, all stiffened panels were modelled as one continuous, orthotropic laminate. A second, very simple, 2 -D model made of beam elements was created {{to be used as}} a crude but simple tool to predict shear forces in the structure. A number of still water load cases were applied to both mono hull and twin hull models. The beam model shows an error margin of 10 - 30 % compared the more detailed model. In the twin hull vessel the main deck is stressed less by applied loads, but the transverse components are stressed more, mainly by shear. Increasing the transverse strength by closing the swash bulkheads will bring down stresses in the transverse bulkheads to acceptable levels. The twin hull connection structure puts too much shear force and bending moment on the vessel as it is. It needs to be ballasted to decrease bending stresses in the main deck and shear stresses in the transverse bulkheads.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} that 3 D BIM objects match tasks accurately, {{the names of the}} objects and tasks require to be briefly checked. As 3 D BIM object names are usually the same as the real names of the objects on OOGP, task names are usually adjusted. Some 3 D BIM objects may also be used for multiple tasks. For example, before the disassembly of <b>topsides,</b> all <b>modules</b> are required to be cleaned and emptied before being removed and lifted by heavy lift vessel. Therefore, in order to assign the 3 D BIM modules to both tasks, the relation in the matching rule is set as many-to-many. With the created matching rule between 3 D BIM objects and decommissioning tasks, 4 D/ 5 D BIM models for different OOGP decommissioning options with different methodologies can be generated in a quick manner, saving much time for the model generation. Finally, different decommissioning options can be visualized and evaluated.|$|R
30|$|According to the {{summarized}} OOGP decommissioning options tree, {{there are}} 9 options when considering an OOGP as a whole, {{and a total}} of 168 potential options exist when considering an OOGP by sections. Therefore, many decommissioning options are available for an OOGP when it reaches its end of service life. In addition, each option can be realized by different methodologies. For example, when topsides is considered to be removed to land, it can be removed as a whole in a single lift by using huge lift vessel, or it can be removed using the reverse installation method, which removes the <b>topsides</b> in <b>modules</b> following the reverse process to its installation. As the working environment of OOGP decommissioning is more demanding compared to the related work onshore, it is important to evaluate different methodologies for the selected decommissioning option. Since 177 possible OOGP decommissioning options are available, the traditional 4 D/ 5 D BIM model creation method, which is usually manually conducted, is time consuming. Therefore, in this study, a semi-automated 4 D/ 5 D BIM model creation approach was proposed to reduce the model creation time.|$|R
40|$|Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessels {{have been}} in {{operation}} for four decades and there are now well over 250 vessels in existence, but their gas equivalent floating liquid natural gas plants kwon as FLNGs are still very new. Consequently designs and arrangement of top-side process units are still evolving and their safety {{has yet to be}} fully and objectively evaluated. This paper explores the probability of occurrence of accidents leading to vapour cloud explosion at one of the <b>topside</b> liquefaction <b>modules</b> of an FLNG. The worst possible scenario with the maximum tolerable probability is identified and the impact of the corresponding vapour cloud explosion is estimated. The strength of the structures supporting the neighbouring modules was examined using finite element analysis to determine if the accident has a potential of escalating to neighbouring modules. It is found that the current levels of safety gaps between the liquefaction modules may be insufficient for the structural arrangement in place. It is thought that a new structural design using circular pipes as the structural elements instead of the I-beams may enhance the integrity of the top-side supporting structures against the impact of potential vapour cloud explosion. The effectiveness of the new structure is demonstrated by comparing it to the conventional supporting structure using I-beam members. This also implies that, by using pipe elements, the safety gaps can be reduced, thus making it possible to optimise the topside arrangement more easily...|$|R
40|$|Structural blast {{analysis}} is usually done with two load levels for different design stages; the Strength Level Blast, SLB, and the Ductility Level Blast, DLB. Strength Level Blast is the lower magnitude overpressure (with a higher {{frequency of occurrence}} and lower consequence) and Ductility Level Blast is the higher magnitude overpressure (with a lower frequency of occurrence and significant consequence). The objective of this thesis {{was to try to}} find an estimated relationship between the linear elastic analysis using Strength Level Blast pressure, and nonlinear plastic analysis using Ductility Level Blast pressure by making an analogy to the procedures of seismic design of structures. For that, four hypothetical methods were introduced and examined to find the one that can provide a better estimated relationship. Furthermore, four SBM <b>topside</b> <b>modules</b> with 22 blast directions were analyzed. Firstly, linear elastic analyses, by means of redundancy analysis, were performed to find the Strength Level Blast capacities. Secondly, nonlinear plastic analyses, by means of static pushover analysis, were performed to obtain the pushover curves. Subsequently, several important parameters that were required for finding the Ductility Level Blast capacities were obtained from the pushover curves, namely, ultimate limit capacities and their respective displacements, the reserve strength ratios and the ductility ratios. In the next stage, the four proposed methods were tested by means of introducing four hypothetical methods each with a different reserve capacity factor, Cr; next, the Strength Level Blast capacities were scaled with these factors to obtain the Ductility Level Blast pressures. These four methods were Displacement Ratios Method, a comparison of ISO 19902 for Earthquake Assessment of Fixed Offshore Platforms for Blast Assessments, the Energy Equivalence Method and the Behavior Parameters’ Method. 9 ̆ 5 Displacement Ratios’ Method assumes the Cr value {{to be based on the}} ratio of the ultimate deflection of the structure to its deflection under the Strength Level Blast pressure. Thus, this method assumes that the structure will continue to behave linearly up until the ultimate capacity of the structure has been reached, which in turn will be the Ductility Level Blast capacity of the structure. 9 ̆ 5 The method described by ISO 19902 for earthquake assessment of fixed offshore platforms assumes the Cr value to be based on the two scaling parameters; the first parameter was the same as the previous method, and the second parameter takes into account the energy absorbed by the structure after the ultimate capacity of the structure has been reached. 9 ̆ 5 The Energy Equivalence Method, the Cr value was obtained by comparing the energy absorbed by the structure until the ultimate capacity has been reached with the energy that would be absorbed if the structure was assumed to behave linearly until the Ductility Level Blast capacity was reached. 9 ̆ 5 The Behavior Parameters’ Method the Cr value was also obtained by equating the energy absorbed by the structure until the ultimate capacity has been reached; however, this method simplifies the area under the graph into two sections; first section in the elastic region, the second section in the nonlinear plastic region until the ultimate capacity of the structure has been reached. Next, this energy was expressed in terms of the Reserve Strength Ratios and Ductility Ratios. In this method the structure was also assumed to be behaving linearly until the Ductility Level Blast capacity has been reached. Finally, after finding the Ductility Level Blast pressures for every module and direction, the Cr values were arranged based on the direction of loading to longitudinal, transverse and diagonal directions, for the small and large modules, in order to find which method had the least scatter for the Cr value. The most desirable results, with the least deviations, were obtained were from the Energy Equivalence Method. In addition, the obtained Ductility Level Blast pressures were compared with the nonlinear dynamic capacities for every module and direction. The main criteria in this comparison was having the calculated pressure less than the calculated dynamic capacities. It was observed that the Energy Equivalence Method gave the most suitable results in this comparison as well. The minimum value of Cr from the Energy Equivalence Method that were concluded were 4. 0, 4. 0 and 3. 6 for the longitudinal, transverse and diagonal directions of the large modules respectively; also, 5. 2, 4. 3 and 4. 3 for the longitudinal, transverse and diagonal directions of the small modules respectively.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} cooling by liquified natural gas, literature on the topic wasinvestigated in prior project work. Test results for cooling of steel by liquid nitrogen wascompared to numerical solutions of heat transfer equations. A simple 1 D approach onheat gradients through a steel plate was developed for theoretical purposes, and over timeshow a comparable temperature profile with the test results. Test results comprised thecooling of a steel plate, from a trough placed over parts of the plate. Structural software USFOS, through the utility FAHTS, was used to model spill overa finite element (FE) model. Two models were utilized, a simplified deck plating modelgenerated specifically for this thesis, and a <b>topside</b> framework <b>module</b> - educational modelfrom NTNU. To describe the steel sections, we assessed steel in terms of performance whensubjected to cooling. Essential input to the analysis, in terms of properties for cryogenicfluid and steel, was identified prior to implementation in FAHTS and USFOS. Formulating the scope, the intent was to assess cryogenic spill simulations performed byComputIT, through the fire simulations software KFX. This being a new field of study,extending cryogenic spill with KFX as an extension to FAHTS proved to be too timeconsuming for the third party software provider. We chose to simplify our spill simulation,through FEM spill formulation for FAHTS, provided by USFOS AS. Applied spill routinestrictly assigns temperature to FE members, and does not offer a dynamic spill scenario. The spill routine, at beta stage for FAHTS, {{was applied to the}} best possible extent withinits limitations. Spill over different types of theoretical FEM elements had various compatibilitywith the spill routine, but the structural response in USFOS could be computed interms of desired temperature profiles from FAHTS. Restrictions were discovered duringthe analysis, and all results and interpretations adopted to these restrictions. Choice ofspill scenario was made from simple deductions on placement and function relative to anFLNG, and can be seen as specific to this thesis. Concluding on our results was done according to scope, with emphasis on steel performance. Important factors for the case of cryogenic temperatures was weighed in wheninterpreting the structural response. Embrittlement {{is the single most important}} factor in our analysis. Marine grade steelwill experience a ductile-to-brittle transition prior to cryogenic temperatures; performingslightly better than ordinary carbon steel. Disregarding any other factors, at the onset ofyielding, there will be abrupt fracture. On the contrary, cooled steel will have an increasein yield stress and tensile strength. Fracture will not occur from stresses imposed by cooling, but in connection with embrittlementand fatigue. Cracks at a critical crack length will not see any additional crackresistance, and there will be no crack arrest following added loading. Effects from contractingsteel, and the stress field arising to compensate for this behavior should be seenas the second most important consequence of cryogenic spillage. Being geometry specific,this does not exhibit any significant stress fields in this thesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} is seeking to improve safety on its current operations procedures (Choudarki, 2012). From all oil and gas operations, Topside Installation Processes (TIP) are the only offshore activity that counters one of the golden safety rules, “do not stand or walk under suspended loads” (Peuscher & Groeneweg, 2012). As a consequence, marine companies are seeking to improve these processes through different technological solutions (Heerema Marine Contractors, 2014). TIP generally consist on the lifting of a heavy <b>module,</b> <b>topside,</b> and its placement on a fixed structure on the sea, jacket (Hee et al., 2007). Traditional positioning tools such as bumpers and guides are not suitable for these type of processes given the heaviness and big dimensions of topsides (Heerema Marine Contractors, 2017). As a consequence, part of the vessel crew is located on the jacket, under the suspended topside, to guide the positioning processes (Breidablikk, 2010). TIP imply the presence of crew members under a suspended load, which is contrary to oil and gas companies’ safety policy. The offshore industry is currently investigating ways to circumvent having personnel on the jacket during topside installations (Heerema Marine Contractors, 2014). The implementation of a camera-based augmented reality positioning tracking system could fulfil the current safety requirements. The use of augmented reality as a positioning tool is a completely new technology that has never been used before in this domain. This research explores the potential expected benefits of the use of an Augmented Reality Positioning System (ARPS) during Offshore Topside Installation Processes (OTIP). This research also investigates the system’s usefulness and the users’ system perception on its usability in OTIP. Moreover, it explores the implications and factors that should be considered in order to successfully implement the ARPS in this type of processes. The research is based on a case that relates to the first augmented reality positioning system for topside installation processes, that is being developed by TWNKLS and Heerema Marine Contractors. The research methodology is based on data collected from different experiments and interview processes. The conclusions include discussion about the benefits, usability and implications of ARPS in OTIP, and recommendations for the ARPS developing companies and for future research.
