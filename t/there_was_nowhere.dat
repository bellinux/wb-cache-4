The Western Han Dynasty writer Sima Qian in his book Historical Records records the story of Shun, a legendary Chinese emperor who ran away from his murderous father by climbing onto the top of a high granary.

25|$|Throughout January 1983 around fifty people {{arrived at}} the {{blockade}} each day. The state government made things difficult for the protesters, passing several laws and enforcing special bail conditions for those arrested. Bulldozers were unloaded at the site from a barge {{under the protection of}} police. A total of 1,217 arrests were made, many simply for being present at the blockade. Protesters impeded machinery and occupied sites associated with the construction work. Nearly 500 people were imprisoned for breaking the terms of their bail. This caused an overflow of prisons in the region. British botanist David Bellamy was jailed, which gave the dispute international attention. The author John Marsden, after being arrested at the blockade, was placed in the high-security Risdon Prison for a night, as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> else to hold him.|$|E
25|$|DutchSouth African Ryan ten Doeschate {{hammered}} a career-best 89 not out as Essex Eagles powered {{their way}} to 273 for 6 at Chelmsford. His innings included five sixes and four fours, as Sajid Mahmood was the main recipient of his boundary-hitting - ending with figures of two for 67 in nine overs. England Under-19 player Tom Smith, who had taken 15 Test wickets in three U-19 matches with Sri Lanka, proved that the gap between Under-19 cricket and List A cricket is huge, as he finished with 42 off his five overs. When Lancashire Lightning batted, Darren Gough got an early wicket of Iain Sutcliffe, and despite scores in the 30s from Andrew Crook and Mal Loye, Lancashire lost their first four wickets for 91 runs. Andrew Symonds rebuilt with Mark Chilton, but once Symonds was bowled by Gough - who ended with four for 31 - <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> to hide for Lancashire. Kyle Hogg blitzed his way to 36, lifting Lancashire to 218, but they still suffered a comprehensive loss.|$|E
25|$|Until 1948, Jewish burials in Jerusalem were {{conducted}} in the centuries-old Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives. In January 1948, the Arab siege of Jerusalem made the Mount of Olives inaccessible, as the route to the cemetery passed through hostile Arab villages. The catalyst {{for the opening of}} Sanhedria Cemetery was the March 23, 1948 explosion of three British army trucks filled with kerosene on Ben Yehuda Street in downtown Jerusalem. The explosion collapsed the Atlantic Hotel and heavily damaged adjacent buildings. Forty-two Jewish men, women, and children were killed in the blast, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> to bury them. While the bodies lay in the courtyard of the Bikur Holim Hospital for five days, representatives of the Kehilat Yerushalayim chevra kadisha scoured the city for a suitable location for a new cemetery. An empty lot next to the Sanhedria neighborhood, in the vicinity of a government agricultural experiments station, was deemed appropriate, and permission was obtained from British Mandate authorities. The site was hastily consecrated by Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog and Sephardi Chief Rabbi Ben-Zion Hai Uziel, and the bodies were buried on the fifth day in the presence of thousands.|$|E

25|$|They started positively, riding {{their luck}} and good favour with the umpires – {{a number of}} lbw appeals were turned down {{both before and after}} tea – as Strauss and Trescothick paired up for 80 for the first wicket before Strauss edged a classic pace-man's short-ball from Lee back into the bowler's waiting hands. Vaughan got nicely off the mark with a four with his second ball, however, {{suggesting}} that England would be playing positively to get the target – but Lee and Warne just kept pounding. Trescothick departed for 44, edging a straight ball from Warne to first slip – having taken him for ten in the previous over – and Bell was left hopelessly plumb to a ball that didn't turn. When Vaughan – who had failed to buy a run off the last 23 deliveries – was bowled comprehensively by Lee, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> to hide for England, and not even an unbeaten 42 from Pietersen to see England to stumps could hide the inevitable – that England needed 301 for the last five wickets, with a world-class bowling attack at the other end.|$|E
25|$|Next {{to cross}} are the Doncaster to Gainsborough railway {{line and the}} B1396 road at Auckley Bridge. The Aldam Drain drains Cantley Low Common, and beyond the junction, the river becomes a high level carrier, with {{permanent}} embanking of both banks, and catchwater drains running along the foot of both banks. At Candy Farm there are two pumping stations, the southern one pumping the Black Bank Drain into the river, and the northern one pumping the East Ring Drain. At Tunnel Pits, there are two more pumping stations, and Tunnel Pits Bridge carries the road which follows Vermuyden's North Idle Drain over the channel. Soon, the South Engine Drain is running parallel to the river, as it crosses under Sandtoft Road and the M180 motorway. As it turns to the east again, the Folly Drain also runs parallel, but a little beyond the A161 bridge, the two drains continue to the east, while the river diverts to the north, to run parallel to the North Engine Drain. The Hatfield Waste Drain runs parallel to the North Engine Drain on its south bank, but after the approach on the Torne, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> for it to go, and so it passes under the North Engine Drain to its north bank through a grade II listed syphon, which was probably built by Samual Foster in 1795 or by Thackray in 1813 {{as part of a}} series of improvements recommended by the engineer John Rennie.|$|E

500|$|Ayananka Bose was the film's cinematographer. According to Bose, its {{location}} {{was the big}} factor in his work: [...] "Dostana is based in Miami and to me Miami means sunshine and beaches. That is what stayed in my mind." [...] Bose chose a bright frame because the film was a comedy about friendship, and the bright frame conveyed vibrancy: [...] "That is what automatically gave Dostana its expression." [...] He found the office set challenging, since <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> to put lights and the room had glass {{on one side and}} a wall on the other. However, Bose enjoyed filming on the apartment and office sets.|$|E
500|$|While {{shooting}} the first subway scenes, D'Onofrio's performance was over-the-top and bombastic. Yoshimura {{asked him to}} act a little calmer during the earlier scenes and save the energy for the later scenes, because [...] "if he did go up right away, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> else {{for him to go}} after that". D'Onofrio agreed and modified his performance accordingly. Fleder also clashed with MacVittie over his portrayal of the Biedron character. Fleder felt that the character appeared too crazy in earlier scenes, and that the actor was telegraphing the twist in which MacVittie {{would turn out to be}} a murderer. MacVittie approached Yoshimura about the criticism, but Yoshimura agreed with Fleder's interpretation. After MacVittie toned down the character's behavior, Fleder said that he was extremely pleased with the end result.|$|E
500|$|... {{offers a}} {{different}} theory: The Acra {{was still standing}} in 139BCE when AntiochusVII Sidetes demanded it back from Simon, along with Jaffa and Gezer, two Hellenized cities Simon had captured. Simon was willing to discuss the two cities but {{made no mention of}} the Acra. It was at this point that he must have sealed its fate, as a way to deny the Seleucids any future claim or hold on Jerusalem. Thus, when AntiochusVII subdued the city during Hyrcanus I's reign, {{each and every one of}} his demands were met—except the one demanding the stationing of a Seleucid garrison in the city. Hyrcanus may have been able to reject, and Antiochus to drop, this demand because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> to billet the garrison, as the Acra would no longer have been standing. This explanation places the razing of the Acra somewhere in the 130sBCE.|$|E

2500|$|Brunel had to {{take the}} two tracks of the South Wales Railway across the River Wye. The Admiralty had insisted on a [...] clear span over the river, with the bridge a minimum of [...] above high tide. The span would have to be self-supporting, since {{although}} the Gloucestershire side of the river consists of a limestone cliff, the Monmouthshire side is low-lying sedimentary deposit subject to regular flooding. Thus on that side, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> for an abutment capable of either resisting the outward push of an arch bridge, or the inward pull of a conventional suspension bridge. In any case, neither could be used: an arch bridge would not have met the height and width restrictions imposed by the Admiralty, and suspension bridges were notoriously unfit for carrying railway trains. The concentrated weight caused the chains to deflect, allowing the bridge-deck to ride dangerously up and down. A self-supporting truss bridge was the only option.|$|E

It did not provide a permanent solution, as it did not {{deal with the problem}} of estate land that was under-utilised but not available to African farmers, nor with the owners' ability to evict tenants. The legislation was overtly race-based, as used the category of [...] "Native" [...] (or African) to determine land rights. There were no large-scale evictions in 1933 and few in 1938, but in 1943 hundreds of families in the Blantyre District refused to leave their tenancies as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> for them to go to, and the colonial authorities declined to use force.
