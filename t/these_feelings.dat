5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} that Japanese people do indeed have warm feelings towards themselves, just like Americans and Europeans, but that <b>these</b> <b>feelings</b> are masked when explicitly asked for. They {{speculated that the}} reason for this masking lies in the Japanese tendency to attend to negative, undesirable features by way of improving the self.|$|E
5|$|Harley's co-creator, Paul Dini, {{describes}} {{their relationship}} as Harley being someone {{who makes the}} Joker feel better about himself, and who can do the work {{that he does not}} want to do himself. In the 1999 one-shot comic Batman: Harley Quinn, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that their relationship is romantic, and that <b>these</b> <b>feelings</b> prevent him from fulfilling his purpose. Removing the traditional male-female relationship, such as in the Batman: Thrillkiller storyline where the Joker (Bianca Steeplechase) is a female and involved in a lesbian relationship with Harley, their relationship lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{acting on}} <b>these</b> <b>feelings</b> and perceptions, Stanton joined Mott, Mott's sister Martha Coffin Wright, Jane Hunt {{and a handful}} of other women in Seneca Falls. Together they {{organized}} the Seneca Falls Convention held in Seneca Falls on July 19 and 20. Over 300 people attended. Stanton drafted a Declaration of Sentiments, which she read at the convention. Modeled on the United States Declaration of Independence, Stanton's declaration proclaimed that men and women are created equal. She proposed, among other things, a then-controversial resolution demanding voting rights for women. The final resolutions, including female suffrage, were passed, in no small measure, because of the support of Frederick Douglass, who attended and informally spoke at the convention.|$|E

5000|$|Art {{is a human}} activity, {{consisting}} in this, {{that one}} man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by <b>these</b> <b>feeling</b> and also experience them. --Leo Tolstoy, What Is Art?

2500|$|Not without {{interest}} {{is the fact that}} in the German Empire, children were able to pass directly into secondary education after attending a privately run, charged [...] "Vorschule" [...] which then was another sort of primary school. The Weimar Constitution banned <b>these,</b> <b>feeling</b> them to be an unjustified privilege, and the Basic Law still contains the constitutional rule (Art. 7 Sect. VI) that: Pre-schools shall remain abolished.|$|R
5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} that the patterns in the findings from both experiments were most consistent with {{the hypothesis that the}} preference is due to an attachment to the self. <b>These</b> <b>feelings</b> leak out to stimuli that are closely associated with the self, not just names and birthdates, but also, implicitly, their constituent letters and numbers. The researchers suggested that the effect is stronger for higher numbers because in daily life these numbers are less saturated with other meanings, other than their associations with birthdays.|$|E
5|$|After Victory Road, Samoa Joe and Booker T {{continued}} their rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the July17 episode of Impact, Management Director Jim Cornette demanded that Booker T give the championship back to Joe, who {{was recognized as}} the official champion by TNA. Booker T refused this demand, while Joe also declined the offer as he felt he did not deserve to hold the title due to being pinned at the event. Due to <b>these</b> <b>feelings,</b> Cornette instead scheduled a rematch between the two for the championship at TNA's next PPV event Hard Justice on August10. On the July24 episode of Impact!, Joe challenged Booker T to contest their rematch in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match, which Booker T accepted after adding that weapons would be allowed in the match. Joe defeated Booker T at the event to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|Assigned male at birth, she {{was given}} the name Joshua Alcorn and raised in Ohio by a family {{affiliated}} with the Churches of Christ movement. At age 14, she came out as transgender to her parents, Carla and Doug Alcorn, who refused to accept her female gender identity. When she was 16, they denied her request to undergo transition treatment, instead sending her to Christian-based conversion therapy {{with the intention of}} convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept her gender as assigned at birth. After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates, her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to social media. In her suicide note, Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing <b>these</b> <b>feelings.</b> She committed suicide by walking out in front of oncoming traffic on the Interstate 71 highway.|$|E

25|$|The {{alleviation}} of dysphoria {{theory suggests}} that people with severe mental illness commonly have a negative self-image, which makes them vulnerable to using psychoactive substances to alleviate <b>these</b> <b>feelings.</b> Despite {{the existence of a}} wide range of dysphoric feelings (anxiety, depression, boredom, and loneliness), the literature on self-reported reasons for use seems to lend support for the experience of <b>these</b> <b>feelings</b> being the primary motivator for drug and alcohol misuse.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards, Desdemona {{begins to}} bid Emilia adieu. This goodbye is {{initially}} accompanied by repeated {{notes on the}} lower woodwinds and strings {{such as those in}} the introduction of the act but in a much more noticeable and dominating manner. This reflects the increasing expectation of Desdemona of her death. Initially, she attempts to keep <b>these</b> <b>feelings</b> to herself, but the orchestra reveals her increasing inner thoughts. <b>These</b> <b>feelings</b> finally reach a point at which they can no longer be contained and Desdemona lets out a loud passionate cry of goodbye to Emilia, one that is reinforced by the full orchestral accompaniment.|$|E
25|$|Social psychologists {{therefore}} {{deal with}} the factors that lead us to behave in a given way {{in the presence of}} others, and look at the conditions under which certain behavior/actions and feelings occur. Social psychology is concerned with the way <b>these</b> <b>feelings,</b> thoughts, beliefs, intentions and goals are constructed and how such psychological factors, in turn, influence our interactions with others.|$|E

25|$|POWs {{experiencing}} the most apparently severe difficulties on repatriation were treated at military psychiatric hospitals such as Northfield Military Hospital. Psychiatrists Major Whiles and Alfred Torrie noted that patients were often 'markedly resentful of everyone and everything.'

25|$|In Chapter I, Ethan {{is waiting}} outside a church dance {{to walk home}} Mattie, his wife’s cousin, who has for a year lived with Ethan and his sickly wife, Zeena (Zenobia), {{in order to help}} out around the house and farm.

25|$|The {{relational}} ties {{principle of}} fusion suggests that highly fused individuals will {{feel that they}} and other group members synergistically strengthen each other. This perception of reciprocal strength should foster the perception that together, {{members of the group}} are uniquely invulnerable. <b>These</b> <b>feelings</b> of invulnerability may serve to insulate strongly fused individuals from fully recognizing the risks associated with extreme acts. Perceptions of invulnerability have been shown to mediate the effects of fusion on endorsement of pro-group behavior.|$|E
25|$|Writer Lawrence Miles {{has stated}} that he {{believes}} the Eighth Doctor has sex with I. M. Foreman between the events of his novels Interference – Book One and Interference – Book Two.

25|$|Alcohol can {{alleviate}} the drinker’s feelings of stress or anxiety. Alcohol myopia limits those {{under the influence}} of alcohol to see the world through a nearsighted lens; in other words, consumption of alcohol will lead individuals to temporarily forget about previous worries or problems, for <b>these</b> <b>feelings</b> lay outside of the restricted set of immediate cues that the drinker can respond to. By depriving him of the attention capacity necessary to process undesirable thoughts, alcohol myopia can bring the drinker a sense of relief.|$|E
50|$|This work {{is part of}} {{the broader}} {{sociology}} of emotions, which notes that socialization {{plays an important role in}} how people experience, interpret, and express emotions, including the situations that evoke a range of feelings. All human beings learn certain <b>feeling</b> rules, but <b>these</b> <b>feeling</b> rules may differ widely depending on the society in which one grows up and one's social position and social identity, including gender and ethnic identity and socio-economic status. Feeling rules are flexible and the ways in which they impinge on one's experience in different settings influences one's personality, both in specific contexts (e.g. at work, home, school, or in different social groups) and over time.|$|R

25|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} are {{a group of}} mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. <b>These</b> <b>feelings</b> may cause physical symptoms, such as a fast heart rate and shakiness. There {{are a number of}} anxiety disorders: including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. People often have more than one anxiety disorder.|$|E
25|$|Some memory {{issues are}} due to stress, anxiety, or depression. A {{traumatic}} life event, such as {{the death of a}} spouse, can lead to changes in lifestyle and can leave an elderly person feeling unsure of themselves, sad, and lonely. Dealing with such drastic life changes can therefore leave some people confused or forgetful. While in some cases <b>these</b> <b>feelings</b> may fade, it is important to take these emotional problems seriously. By emotionally supporting a struggling relative and seeking help from a doctor or counselor, the forgetfulness can be improved.|$|E
25|$|One {{motivation}} for seeking anger management can be career related. As both a preventative and corrective tool, anger management {{is available to}} help individuals cope with potentially anger-inducing aspects of their jobs. One such situation applies to caretakers of individuals with mental illness. The daily stress combined with slow or no progress with the people under their care can create {{a high level of}} frustration. Skills training for caretakers of relatives with dementia has been developed to help cope with <b>these</b> <b>feelings</b> of frustration in a positive manner.|$|E
