Producer Cathy Elliot said, [...] "It's a {{very sensitive}} issue and of course it's terrible for the parents to have the whole thing brought up.

Reacting to her father's outburst, Mary briefly points out that {{other members of the}} family are rarely there {{to take care of the}} parents, before Jane and Michael get into a fight over Jane's doll Valentine, prompting a displeased Mary to order them to bed and enchant them to sleep.

2500|$|Joseph Kabila {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "a more adept political leader than his father".

[...] To compare, according to an analyst from the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit, [...] "The only obstruction had been Kabila because the [...] accord called for the government's democratic transition and that was a threat to his power." ...|$|E
2500|$|Political {{commentators}} took {{different views}} on the raids, with intelligence agencies researcher and journalist Nicky Hager suggesting the raids {{may have been the}} result of the increased police and SIS staffing and resources aimed at anti-terrorism since 2001. (The raids and the surveillance preceding them cost $8 million to plan and execute.) Veteran activist John Minto criticised the police for the move, claiming that their actions provoked a [...] "climate of fear and repression" [...] while left-leaning commentator and blogger Martyn [...] "Bomber" [...] Bradbury, sided with the police, saying that in his dealings with the activist community he had become concerned with the actions of [...] "some clowns." [...] The Herald was criticised for publishing these comments which did not mention who the [...] "clowns" [...] were or name the blog site Bradbury claimed to have communicated with them on. New Zealand Herald columnist Matt McCarten saw the raids as being over the top; [...] "Some of the young people I know who were arrested are actually vegans who don't even believe in killing animals, let alone human beings. When you get the police searching homes of environmental activists trying to save snails on the West Coast, you know <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>have</b> got really silly." [...] McCarten also stated that New Zealanders should be more worried about the country joining the US database of terrorist suspects, and [...] "the creeping powers of our secret police." [...] However the 'From the left' columnist for the Dominion Post, Chris Trotter reacted differently, saying [...] "it wasn't the actions of the police that provoked my fury, but of those who'd forced their hand." [...] When left-wing musician Don Franks wrote a protest song about the raids, [...] "Safer Communities Together Blues" [...] he took a swipe at Trotters reaction with the lyrics [...] "The political climate's getting hotter / Got to watch out for the pigs and the pigs' Trotter." ...|$|E
