500|$|It wasn’t as hard as, say, {{running around}} with all my gear on in Jarhead. I’d rather go for an awkward moment than {{physical}} exertion any day. The only thing that I think [...] get freaked out about when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something like kiss {{a guy in a}} movie—when to their knowledge they’re straight—is that they’re afraid they’re going to be turned on. And if you’re not afraid that you’re going to be turned on—meaning that you know what you like—then really it’s not that hard.|$|E
500|$|This initial {{idea would}} have been an episode-long flashback, {{illustrating}} the fall of Atlanta and centering on the mission of a doomed soldier who loses his team. Darabont was influenced by the American war film Black Hawk Down (2001). [...] "All <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is travel maybe a dozen blocks", he said, [...] "a simple journey, but what starts as a no-brainer scenario goes from 'the city is being secured' to 'holy shit, we've lost control, the world is ending'." [...] The episode would have introduced several characters, including Andrea, Dale, and Amy (Emma Bell).|$|E
500|$|The Mets' Ron Darling took {{a no-hitter}} and 4–0 lead into {{the eighth inning}} against the Phillies on June 28 at the Vet before 52,206 fans. Philadelphia's Greg Gross pinch-hit and tripled to lead off the eighth inning, {{breaking}} up the no-hitter. Juan Samuel then singled {{to break up the}} shutout, and the Phillies came back with nine hits against Jesse Orosco and Roger McDowell, scoring five runs to win 5–4. It would have been the first no-hitter in Mets history. Compounding the loss for the Mets, the Phillies were in last place at the time, and the loss dropped the Mets [...] games behind the first-place Cardinals who they would play the next day. Of the win and the Mets, Mike Schmidt said, [...] "The Mets don't like to give credit when they lose, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it today." ...|$|E

500|$|Much of the {{criticism}} towards the Avatar spoof [...] "In the Na'Vi" [...] goes towards {{the timing of the}} episode. Surette thought that it was [...] "n Avatar spoof that came about two years too late. This sketch had no redeeming qualities and should be erased from the minds of all Simpsons fans immediately." [...] Similarly, Marnell commented that in the episode [...] "The Simpsons' finally gets around to parodying 'Avatar' — a movie picked to death by 'South Park' and other series a year or two ago" [...] and further elaborated that [...] "t's almost a straight forward retelling of 'Avatar' without the biting satire that made the film parodies of previous years so much fun." [...] In general, Treehouse of Horror episodes take about a year to complete for the staff. This is because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> many original designs, such as characters and backgrounds. Prior to the airing of the episode, Jean revealed that the staff was already working on [...] "Treehouse of Horror XXIII".|$|E
500|$|Steve Harris, Iron Maiden's bassist {{and primary}} songwriter, {{has stated that}} his {{influences}} include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull, Thin Lizzy, UFO and Wishbone Ash. In 2010 Harris stated, [...] "I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, all <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is listen to Wishbone Ash's Argus album. Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then {{we wanted to have}} a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it." [...] In 2004, Harris explained that the band's [...] "heaviness" [...] was inspired by [...] "Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in." [...] On top of this, Harris developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as [...] "more like a rhythm guitar," [...] cited as responsible for the band's galloping style, heard in such songs as [...] "The Trooper" [...] and [...] "Run to the Hills." ...|$|E
500|$|Lee {{found that}} in {{contrast}} to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a [...] "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed {{like a human being}} and getting sympathy, they feel <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things, they have to carry the movie." [...] Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is [...] "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing... and not [...] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." [...] For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, [...] "'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was very good about it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.|$|E

500|$|The brawl, {{along with}} an {{incident}} between the Vancouver Canucks' Todd Bertuzzi and Steve Moore of the Colorado Avalanche, (in which Bertuzzi hit Moore from behind, breaking his neck, in retaliation for a hit by Moore on one of Bertuzzi's team-mates a month earlier), brought the issue of violence in ice hockey into focus. Particular attention was given to retaliation; when Brashear was interviewed {{on the subject of}} the Bertuzzi incident, he defended such on-ice revenge, and suggested that Bertuzzi should not receive a suspension, because [...] "all <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is go after him when he comes back." [...] That mindset echoed the comments made by Ken Hitchcock and Mark Recchi about Martin Havlat, and Sam Donnellon of the Philadelphia Daily News suggested that it was prevailing opinion amongst all the players in the League. He suggested that rather than wanting stricter penalties to clamp down on dangerous play, (which he advocated), the players believed that removing the penalty for instigating a fight, and allowing players to therefore get their retribution by that means, would have the same effect. Mike Heika of The Dallas Morning News also believed that the league should be stricter in handing out fines and suspensions, suggesting that Hitchcock should possibly have been penalised for his revenge comments, and that if Havlat had received a lengthier ban for his actions, the brawl between the Flyers and Senators may not have happened.|$|E
2500|$|After {{constantly}} explaining {{concepts and}} story outlines to interviewers and fans, Turner chose {{to keep the}} thematic basis of In the Absence of Truth quiet. [...] "Through explaining the last two albums time and time again, I just started to become weary of the topic, and I started to feel like I was losing my connection to {{the music and the}} lyrics simply from having repeated it so many times [...] I feel there's a lot of emphasis these days placed on explaining everything in such a fashion that there's really nothing left for the listener or reader to explore themselves. It's all spelled out," [...] Turner continues. [...] "So it's interesting to leave some of that stuff open-ended so <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a little bit of legwork themselves." [...] He was similarly reticent about revealing much which went into Wavering Radiant, beyond noting that Carl Jung's theories, and dreams, served as inspiration.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 June 2014, Robert Blackwill, {{the former}} Coordinator for Strategic Planning and Deputy US National Security Advisor during the {{presidency}} of George W. Bush, spoke at length about India-US relations and said : [...] "Mr Modi is a determined leader. He is candid and frank. I also worked with him during the Gujarat earthquake when I was posted as (the US) ambassador to India. (...) It was mistake by the current Obama administration to delay engagement with Mr Modi. I {{do not know why}} they did so but definitely, this did not help in building relationship. (...) The old formula and stereotypes will not work if the US administration wants to engage with Mr Modi. The Indian prime minister is candid, direct and smart. He speaks his mind. The US administration also has to engage in candid conversation when Mr Modi meets President Obama later this year. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something innovative to engage with him." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Delgado-Pritchett family plot, Jay (Ed O'Neill) meets Mitch's old acting friend Ben Dugan, who is {{starring}} {{in a new}} movie Maple Drive. Jay, not knowing it is a horror movie, takes Manny (Rico Rodriguez) to the movie, and Manny is completely frightened by it. While Jay is fixing the broken doorbell (which repeatedly rings), Manny thinks it is a demon and gets his fencing sword. Jay promises Gloria (Sofía Vergara) his fear will only last a while, although he realizes <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something when Manny begins sleeping in their bed. He asks Ben to come for a visit to show Manny how likable he is so {{he will not be}} scared anymore. When Ben arrives, he knocks on the window since the doorbell does not work. Manny sees him, and when Ben sees him he says [...] "Are you Manny? I'm here for you." [...] Due to the lighting on his face and his fake machete, Manny becomes especially frightened of him and rushes upstairs, much to Jay's disbelief.|$|E
2500|$|Generally men aged 50 years, and on some islands men aged 60 years, {{do most of}} {{the talking}} and {{decision}} making at meetings of the community councils (Falekaupule), which are organised according to the law and custom of each island. Although women have the vote in meetings of the Falekaupule on [...] 7 of the 9 islands, but most do no exercise their voting rights. Milikini Failautusi, young Tuvaluan activist, has argued that cultural issues in Tuvalu are preventing women from working in equal partnership with men. For example, women cannot be appointed as an aliki (chief). Ms Failautusi is quoted as saying [...] "hen it comes to cultures, women they don't [...] to say anything at all. They don't have a say. They only have to sit at the back and support the elders or their husbands or the leaders in their families [...] [...] [...] All <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is just support them in terms of looking for money, looking for food, and looking after the babies and the families".|$|E
2500|$|While {{speaking}} at the 2017 Conservative Party Conference, Johnson caused upset by remarking that the Libyan city Sirte, which had been the site of sustained conflict between the so-called Islamic State and the Libyan Government of National Accord, could be the new Dubai, adding, [...] "all <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is clear the dead bodies away". Following his remarks several Tory MPs called for his sacking. According to The Economist, as Foreign Secretary Johnson “is ridiculed abroad and disliked in the Foreign Office.” [...] Martin Fletcher fears Johnson is harming British interests abroad Fletcher wrote, [...] "Another former British ambassador, requesting anonymity, called him “the least deserving and least qualified foreign secretary of modern times, who has successfully lived down to all expectations”. A senior European diplomat based in London concurred, saying that Johnson was “not taken seriously as a foreign policy actor” and was damaging British interests. He reckoned that three-fifths of the 27 EU ambassadors in London quite like Johnson but consider him ill-suited to the job, while the remaining two-fifths “positively dislike him”. [...] My interlocutors are, of course, experts in their field and fully paid-up members of the metropolitan elite. (...) I, too, am dismayed by the harm that Johnson is doing to my country and appalled {{by the possibility of}} him becoming prime minister." ...|$|E
