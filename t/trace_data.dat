25|$|The {{idea that}} nanoflares might heat the corona was {{proposed}} by Eugene Parker in the 1980s {{but is still}} controversial. In particular, ultraviolet telescopes such as TRACE and SOHO/EIT can observe individual micro-flares as small brightenings in extreme ultraviolet light, but {{there seem to be}} too few of these small events to account for the energy released into the corona. The additional energy not accounted for could be made up by wave energy, or by gradual magnetic reconnection that releases energy more smoothly than micro-flares and therefore doesn't appear well in the <b>TRACE</b> <b>data.</b> Variations on the micro-flare hypothesis use other mechanisms to stress the magnetic field or to release the energy, and are a subject of active research in 2005.|$|E

Simulations reveal a stable asynchronous irregular ground state with heterogeneous activity across areas, layers, and populations. Elicited by large-scale interactions, the model reproduces longer intrinsic time scales in higher compared to early visual areas. Activity propagates down the visual hierarchy, similar to experimental results associated with visual imagery.

This will lead to improved maintenance procedures by transport operators and, further, will enable the tracking and tracing of containers and pallets demanded by transport customers. This research provides guidelines for the adoption of Radio Frequency Identifi cation (RFID) for vehicle tracking and tracing, especially in rail logistics.

40|$|Background—Studies of {{neuronal}} differentiation in vitro often involve tracing {{and analysis of}} neurites. NeuronJ (1, 2) is a program {{that can be used}} for semi-automated tracing of individual neurons; when tracing is completed, a text file containing neurite length measurements is generated. Using cultured hippocampal neurons, we have found that to reach statistical significance it is generally necessary to trace about 100 neurons in each treatment group. Post <b>tracing</b> <b>data</b> analysis requires importing each text file into a statistics program. Analysis of distinct parameters, such as effects of a treatment on axonal versus dendritic branching, requires a great deal of time consuming post <b>tracing</b> <b>data</b> manipulation. Methods—We have developed XL_Calculations, a Java based program that performs batch analysis on NeuronJ measurement files and automatically makes multiple calculations, including the number, length and total output (sum length) of primary, secondary and tertiary neurites on axons and dendrites and writes the calculations into an Excel worksheet. Results and Conclusion—Batch processing of NeuronJ measurement files dramatically reduces the time required to analyze neuronal morphology. In addition, our program performs more than 45 distinct calculations, enabling detailed determination of treatment effects on {{neuronal differentiation}}. Using this program to analyze NeuronJ <b>tracing</b> <b>data,</b> we demonstrate that continuous exposure of differentiating hippocampal neurons to Netrin 1 increases the number of secondary branches on both axons and dendrites, without significantly altering the length of the axon, dendrites or branches. Similar results were obtained whether neurons were grown on poly-d-lysine or laminin...|$|R

40|$|The basic {{reproductive}} number (R) {{and the distribution}} of the serial interval (SI) are often used to quantify transmission during an infectious disease outbreak. In this paper, we pres-ent estimates of R and SI from the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong and Singapore, and the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H 1 N 1) outbreak in South Africa using methods that expand upon an existing Bayesian framework. This expanded framework allows for the incorpo-ration of additional information, such as contact <b>tracing</b> or household <b>data,</b> through prior dis-tributions.
