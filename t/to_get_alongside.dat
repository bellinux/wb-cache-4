25|$|The {{start of}} the race saw Michael Schumacher {{immediately}} cut Montoya, making the Colombian brake and avoid a collision, this allowed Barrichello <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>alongside</b> Montoya coming into the first corner. Montoya however managed to out-brake the Brazilian into the first corner and thus was alongside Schumacher going through the corner. As the Williams and Ferrari travelled through the corner, Schumacher's Ferrari started to experience understeer and went into Montoya's car, taking the Ferrari front wing off. The incident left Montoya going wide and going off the track for a brief moment.|$|E
25|$|Small vessels {{headed to}} assist her {{including}} the Port of Dover tugs Lady Brassey and Lady Crundall, trawlers, dredgers and a destroyer. As Maloja steamed astern {{and unable to}} stop, the rescue vessels were unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>alongside</b> to take off survivors. A heavy sea was running and the hundreds who crowded her decks could only don a cork lifejacket, jump overboard and try to swim clear. A number of her rafts either were launched or floated clear, {{and some of her}} survivors managed to board them. Maloja sank 24 minutes after being mined, followed by Empress of Fort William which sank about 40 minutes after being mined.|$|E
25|$|The ships reached Dunedin Star on 1 or 2 December. Nerine {{launched}} {{some of her}} supply-laden Carley floats {{to reach}} the shore party, but the strong current swept them away. She {{moved closer to the}} shore, launched her remaining floats and returned to Walvis Bay. Temeraire launched her motor boat and took 10 men off Dunedin Star, but the boat shipped a lot of water which stopped her motor. The Norwegian boatmen then rowed {{for an hour and a}} half to Manchester Division, which took the 10 survivors aboard. The Norwegians were now so exhausted that Temeraire had to take them and their boat back aboard. The next day Sir Charles Elliot arrived. Temeraire again lowered her motor boat, which in four trips rescued the remaining 32 men from Dunedin Star and transferred them all to Sir Charles Elliot. In the heavy sea the tug then struggled <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>alongside</b> Manchester Division to transfer all of the rescued men except Captain Lee and his Chief and Second Engineers, who were taken aboard Nerine.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a practice}} {{context in which}} process and movement {{are central to the}} provision of care and support. It draws on data from a research project conducted with The Men’s Room, Manchester, England which used ethnographic and mobile methods to explore the complex task staff undertake in engaging and supporting highly vulnerable young men. The organisation’s commitment <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>alongside</b> these young men includes a mobile and highly improvised use of temporary city centre spaces for delivering its work. In this paper, I argue that these movements of practice are not simply a logistical necessity or a physical activity, but involve a kinetic way of attending, reflecting, thinking and knowing in which the organisation’s movements are intrinsic to the provision of care and support...|$|R
2500|$|On Christmas Day 1862, Smith {{was charged}} with hastily improvising the CS Bayou City, CS Neptune, along with the tenders Lucy Gwinn and the John F. Carr for battle as improvised Cottonclad warships. The Bayou City was {{outfitted}} with a single 32-pounder rifled cannon and the Neptune with two 24-pounders howitzers. Cotton bales were used to provide a semblance of protection that was somewhat effective in stopping small arm fire, however when asked by a soldier about artillery protection Smith bluntly replied: [...] "None whatsover... our only chance is <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>alongside</b> before they hit us". Boarding devices resembling the Roman Corvus {{were placed on the}} hurricane deck of each boat. Facing Smith's forces were vastly superior Union naval forces: , , , , , , and four smaller vessels.|$|E
2500|$|That evening, {{the storm}} increased. [...] Comet drifted closer to Daunt rock. [...] When she was 60 {{yards from the}} rock, as {{darkness}} approached, the Coxswain decided the only option was to try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>alongside</b> and for the crew to jump for the lifeboat. He knew the dangers. On the first attempt, one man got on board, on the second attempt no one jumped; a third time, and five men were safe. The lifeboat went in a fourth and fifth time, and again no one {{was able to make}} it. Two men were still on board, clinging to the rails, too exhausted to jump. On the sixth attempt, as the Mary Stanford came alongside, the two were seized by the lifeboat crew and dragged aboard. [...] (This moment was depicted on the postage stamp) ...|$|E
2500|$|At 8.15 am, the Cromer Lifeboat was {{launched}} and {{was asked to}} aid the English Trader. She was crewed by twelve men including the triple RNLI Gold Medal holding coxswain Henry Blogg. By 11.35 that morning, the lifeboat, H F Bailey had reached Hammond Knoll. By this time, three of the English Traders crew had been swept off the foundering ship to their death. By the time the H F Bailey reached the ship the gale was at full force. The remaining 44 crew of the stricken ship had taken refuge in the chart room, the highest and safest point on the ship. The Cromer lifeboat made two attempts to get a line to the English Trader without any success. A further attempt at rescue resulted in a near disaster for the H F Bailey and {{in the death of}} one of her crew. Coxswain Blogg had attempted to approach the stricken vessel and a wall of water hit the lifeboat on her port side which washed five of the lifeboat men, including the non-swimmer Blogg, overboard into the raging sea. The five men were hauled back on to the lifeboat but the signalman, Edward [...] "Boy Primo" [...] W Allen after being in the water for 25 minutes fell unconscious and died a short time later. At 3 pm, the Cromer lifeboat broke off the rescue attempt and made for Great Yarmouth. Her crew had tried in vain for seven hours to rescue the crew of the English Trader and were now exhausted. Meanwhile, the Great Yarmouth and Gorleston Lifeboat had been launched and was on its way. Between 4 and 6 pm, that lifeboat made five attempts <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>alongside</b> with a line without any success. After these attempts and with darkness setting in, Coxswain Charles Johnson and his crew also reluctantly returned to Great Yarmouth after receiving orders from the Royal Navy. By 8 am the next morning, the Cromer Lifeboat was back at the Sands. The sea had calmed considerably and the H F Bailey was able to take the beleaguered crew of 44 from the English Trader with relative ease, taking them to the safety of Great Yarmouth. The English Trader was then left stuck upon the sands of Hammond Knoll. Reports from the following day said that the English Trader had gone completely under the waves. Henry Blogg received a silver medal for this rescue.|$|E

25|$|One {{lifeboat}} contained 38 {{people and}} was commanded by Captain Capon. Chief Officer Vernon commanded a second, which with difficulty {{in the heavy}} sea collected nine survivors from five liferafts. Mr Vernon's boat transferred the Third Officer, Roland Moscrop-Young, to command the third boat, leaving Mr Vernon's boat with 34 people. Mr Moscrop-Young's boat contained 27 people and was the least crowded boat. Mr Moscrop-Young tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it <b>alongside</b> <b>to</b> take some people off Captain Capon's, but was prevented by the heavy sea. Capon ordered the three boats to keep together overnight and then sail for the Azores, which were about 570 miles to the south.|$|R
60|$|A {{boat was}} at once sent off to the craft {{carrying}} the two orderlies and the horses of the staff. As soon as the despatch was written, Stanley, after shaking hands with his companions, was also rowed to the horse barge. This was, at a signal of the general, taken in tow by the steamer, and piloted to the opposite bank. A boat, sounding ahead, presently found a spot where there was enough water for the barge <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>alongside</b> the bank. The horses were led ashore; and Stanley, the two troopers, and Meinik mounted.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{everything}} required was {{passed into the}} boat, she was dropped astern, nearly to the whole length of the studding-sail halyards. This would make her tow more safely to both parties: to those in her, because there was less risk of the ship's dragging her under; and to ourselves, because it removed all danger of the Englishmen's returning our favour, by effecting a surprise in their turn. At such {{a distance from the}} ship, there would always be time for us to rally and defeat any attempt <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>alongside.</b>|$|E
