The question discussed in the essay is whether the case law of the European Court of Justice deems these "positive actions" as a normative exception to the prohibition of every discrimination (therefore of restrictive interpretation) or as a normative expression of the general principle of equality. At present the case law suggests an holistic approach. The equality principle, in that vein, is structured not only in a negative, but in a positive dimension too. The unwritten European Union law recognizes a substantial or "true" meaning of the equality, whose fulfilment is entrusted to the national (or European) legislator. However the negative dimension of the principle mandates a careful delimitation of the special privilege attributed to <b>the</b> <b>under-represented</b> <b>sex,</b> and may conveniently force (by virtue of the substantial strand of the equality) its extension to the disadvantaged person of the opposite sex...|$|E

40|$|Background : As {{the number}} of people with {{diabetes}} is increasing rapidly worldwide, a more thorough understanding of the psychosocial aspects of living with this condition has become an important health care priority. While our knowledge has grown substantially {{over the past two decades}} with respect to the physical, emotional and social difficulties that people with diabetes may encounter, many important issues remain to be elucidated. Under the umbrella of the Diabetes MILES (Management and Impact for Long-term Empowerment and Success) Study International Collaborative, Diabetes MILES – The Netherlands aims to examine how Dutch adults with diabetes manage their condition and how it affects their lives. Topics of special interest in Diabetes MILES - The Netherlands include subtypes of depression, Type D personality, mindfulness, sleep and sexual functioning. Methods/design : Diabetes MILES – The Netherlands was designed as a national online observational study among adults with diabetes. In addition to a main set of self-report measures, the survey consisted of five complementary modules to which participants were allocated randomly. From September to October 2011, a total of 3, 960 individuals with diabetes (40 % type 1, 53 % type 2) completed the battery of questionnaires covering a broad range of topics, including general health, self-management, emotional well-being and contact with health care providers. People with self-reported type 1 diabetes (specifically those on insulin pump therapy) were over-represented, as were those using insulin among respondents with self-reported type 2 diabetes. People from ethnic minorities were <b>under-represented.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sex</b> distribution was fairly equal in the total sample, participants spanned a broad age range (19 – 90 years), and diabetes duration ranged from recent diagnosis to living with the condition for over fifty years. Discussion : The Diabetes MILES Study enables detailed investigation of the psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes and an opportunity to put these findings in an international context. With several papers planned resulting from a pooled Australian-Dutch dataset and data collections planned in other countries, the Diabetes MILES Study International Collaborative will contribute substantially to identifying potentially unmet needs of those living with diabetes and to inform clinical research and care across the globe. <br /...|$|R

The main contribution of the thesis is a new approach to the problem that we call Naive Bayes Sampling. The approach is a generative approach.

40|$|A map {{encompassing}} 300 kilobases (kb) in {{and around}} the human alpha-globin gene complex shows features with important implications for understanding the structure and function of the human genome. In contrast to other segments of the mammalian genome that have been analysed by pulsed field gradient electrophoresis (PFGE), this region contains an unusually high density of sites for infrequently cutting restriction enzymes that recognise GC rich motifs including <b>the</b> <b>under-represented</b> CpG doublet. This suggests that the 26 kilobase (kb) stretch of DNA containing the alpha-globin gene family, which is known from sequence analysis to be 60 % GC rich, is itself embedded within a region of high GC content. This long-range structure, identified by PFGE, corresponds to a class of GC rich isochores that are thought to represent early replicating DNA present in Giemsa negative chromosomal bands. The identification of such regions by PFGE will be of value in understanding the organisation of human chromosomes and will influence the strategies used to construct a physical map of the genome...|$|R
40|$|Rare {{events are}} {{involved}} in many challenging real world classification problems, where the minority class is usually the most expensive to sample and to label.

Furthermore, the classical accuracy measure is misleading, as it assumes equal importance for the true positives and the true negatives. We propose a classification procedure based on Support Vector Machine able to effectively cope with data imbalance. Using a first step approximate solution and then a suitable kernel transformation, we enlarge asymmetrically space around the class boundary, compensating data skewness. We also propose an accuracy measure, named AGF, that properly accounts for the different misclassification costs of the two classes.

Otherwise, sufficiency principles-restraint, precaution, polluter pays, zero, reverse onus-address the defining characteristics of current trends, namely environmental criticality, risk export, and responsibility evasion. They engage overconsumption. They compel decision-makers to ask when too much resource use or too little regeneration risks important values such as ecological integrity and social cohesion, when material gains now preclude material gains in the future, when consumer gratification or investor reward threatens economic security, when benefits internalized depend on costs externalized.
