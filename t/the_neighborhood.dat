40|$|Summary. This paper {{examines}} four selected {{consequences of}} private market revitalization in 12 neighborhoods in six US ~i ies. The analysis {{reveals that the}} physical quality of properties has been improved significantly, property assessments have increased substantially, and the investment in the properties by newcomers to <b>the</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> has encouraged original owners to improve their properties in one-third of <b>the</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> studied. However, <b>the</b> increase in assessed values generally has lagged far behind increases in {{the market value of}} the properties. Reinvestment also appears to have generated negative consequences. Many of the renters living in <b>the</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> prior to <b>the</b> start of reinvestment, many of whom had a low socioeconomic status, may have been displaced. In addition, the assessed value of properties owned by persons living in <b>the</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> prior to revitalization and not improved during revitalization increased {{as a result of the}} changes occurring in <b>the</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b> <b>The</b> percentage increase in the assessed value of these properties was not significantly less than the increase for properties improved by newcomers...|$|R
