40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine whether published investment advice generates higher returns for investors. We investigate the impact of security recommendations in the financial press on common stock prices in Istanbul Stock Exchange. Recommendations of Investor Ali column of the weekly-published popular economics journal Moneymatik constitutes our sample. The column is designed to inform individual investors about company prospects and use them as the basis for its recommendations. The results show that the published investment advice in <b>this</b> <b>column</b> <b>does</b> not help small investors earn excess returns. On the contrary, it provides a valuable deal to its `preferred investors', if any, in selecting the stocks. If one could front-run the column's recommendations by five days he/she could earn more than 5 % per week in excess of the index return. Compounded annually the excess return of a preferred investor could earn would be more than an amazing 1500 % per annum...|$|E

40|$|Antisera to {{the sodium}} dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -polyacrylamide gel-derived polyoma virion polypeptides were used in immunoprecipitation {{experiments}} with ethylene glycol-bis-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) -dissociated polyoma virions and capsids to determine the specificity of the antipolyoma polypeptide sera. Additionally, a technique for applying 125 I-labeled immunoglobulins to SDS-polyacrylamide gels was used to explore the antigenic specificities of the antisera. The results demonstrated that antisera directed against the SDS-gel-derived VP 1, VP 2, and VP 3 did not react with native polyoma proteins, but would react with the appropriate antigens on denatured polyoma proteins. Antisera against the histone region of such gels reacted with native and denatured polyoma VP 1. Separation of neutralizing antibodies from hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibodies to polyoma in antisera directed against the histone region of polyacrylamide gels was done by using a polyoma capsid affinity column. The antibodies eluted from <b>this</b> <b>column</b> which <b>did</b> not react with capsids possessed only neutralizing activity, whereas antibodies which bound to capsids possessed only HAI activity.
