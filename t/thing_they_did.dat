5|$|In {{what was}} {{according}} to coach Lou Holtz a prearranged move, New York Jets rookie quarterback Richard Todd {{was replaced by}} Joe Namath {{late in the first}} quarter. Namath responded with a passing display that gave the Jets a 24–0 halftime lead. Saying that his players were “polite” to Namath, coach McKay compared the Buccaneers to a junior-high team, and said that the only <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> better than the Jets was to be the first team on the field after halftime. Clark Gaines rushed for 103 yards for the Jets. The Buccaneers’ three quarterbacks combined for 171 yards passing, more than the Jets’ quarterbacks, but the Buccaneers failed to score for the fourth time in the season. As the score rose, the press box announcer began calling out records set during the game, which included the Jets’ first shutout in Shea Stadium. This was considered to be the Buccaneers’ last good chance to win a game, with the next four opponents all in playoff contention. The Jets’ 34 points were nearly a third of their season total of 110 after ten games, and a fifth of their season total of 169.|$|E

500|$|Vincent D'Onofrio's {{character}} in [...] "Subway" [...] partially inspired {{the creation of}} the antagonist played by Bryan Cranston in [...] "Drive", a sixth season episode of The X-Files, which first aired on November 15, 1998. In the episode, Cranston's character is unpleasant and anti-semitic, but he is dying throughout the episode, and screenwriter Vince Gilligan intended for the audience to sympathize with him despite his unlikeable qualities. Gilligan said that this was influenced by [...] "Subway", which he called an [...] "amazing episode". He said of D'Onofio's character: [...] "The brilliant <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> in this episode, the thing that stuck with me, was this guy's an asshole, the guy really is unpleasant, and yet at the end (you) still feel his humanity." [...] The casting of Cranston in this role directly led Gilligan to eventually cast him as the lead in his television series Breaking Bad.|$|E

Later, the chief military and civilian figures responsible for the shooting were removed from their positions as the press came {{to accept the fact that}} the strike dealt with poor conditions and was not a communist-led anti-regime action. As early as 9 August, the left-leaning Adevărul wrote: [...] "What happened at Lupeni is a warning for our leaders, who for ten years have divided the country and ruined her economically, everywhere spreading misery, the mother of desperate mass actions".|$|E

2500|$|The Ryback {{character}} {{has been described}} as [...] "Goldberg meets The Ultimate Warrior meets Rob Van Dam's tights". Owing to similarities between him and Goldberg, the portmanteau of [...] "Ryberg" [...] was devised for Reeves. In October 2012, after Reeves allegedly [...] "stole" [...] a move used by Goldberg during a match, Goldberg would respond by stating, [...] "now comparisons offend me". Spectators at WWE events had been chanting [...] "Goldberg" [...] during Reeves' matches from 2012, which Reeves said [...] "never bothered [...] ". In response to podcast host and mixed martial artist Chael Sonnen's confusion about Ryback's appeal in late 2014, former WWE writer Jon Piermarini noted that the creative staff were doing [...] "essentially the exact same <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> with the character when it did not work or catch on the first time" [...] and would only continue to get Goldberg's character over as Ryback. Reeves has garnered praise from peers, as wrestler Wade Barrett stated that he is [...] "a huge fan of Ryback". WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley said Ryback [...] "had been doing a great job" [...] in his solo promos, and that Ryback's first verbal interaction, opposite Foley in 2013, [...] "went really well".|$|E
