5|$|Mulder and Scully {{determine}} {{that one of}} the dead men belonged to an Islamic terrorist group, the Isfahan, and using <b>the</b> <b>ATM</b> video are able to track down Lauren. A screenshot of the video reveals a blurry figure who appears to be Howard Graves. The agents meet with Lauren at her home and after initially denying it, she admits to the incident but knows nothing about the murders. Upon leaving, the agents find their car going out of control on its own, leading it to crash into another car. At a repair shop, the car is found to have no evidence of tampering, but an electrical charge is detected within it.|$|E
5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). <b>The</b> <b>ATM</b> protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E
25|$|A-T {{is caused}} by a defect in <b>the</b> <b>ATM</b> gene, which is {{responsible}} for managing the cell’s response to multiple forms of stress including double-strand breaks in DNA. In simple terms, the protein produced by <b>the</b> <b>ATM</b> gene recognizes that there is a break in DNA, recruits other proteins to fix the break, and stops the cell from making new DNA until the repair is complete.|$|E

30|$|Views on <b>the</b> <b>ATMs</b> at <b>the</b> poker machine venues {{were mostly}} negative.

25|$|Control of an {{automated}} teller machine (ATM) {{is an example of}} an interactive process in which a computer will perform a logic derived response to a user selection based on information retrieved from a networked database. <b>The</b> <b>ATM</b> process has similarities with other online transaction processes.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>atms</b> is a {{powerful}} tool for automated problem solvers and has been used to support several model-based reasoning tasks such as prediction and diagnosis. It provides an efficient mechanism for maintaining consistent sets of beliefs and recording the assumptions underlying them. This enables the problem solver to switch rapidly between contexts and compare them. Such capabilities are central to diagnostic systems, and are also valuable to design and planning systems. Applications to larger problems have been hampered, however, by the problem solver's inability to maintain control over <b>the</b> <b>atms.</b> We present a new approach, implemented in a system called coco, which allows the problem solver to maintain tight control over the contexts explored by <b>the</b> <b>atms.</b> Coco provides means for expressing local and global control over both normal and nogood consumers. Local control is achieved by attaching guards to individual consumers. These guards express control, rather than logical, knowledge an [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Carriers of A-T, such as {{the parents}} of a person with A-T, have one mutated copy of <b>the</b> <b>ATM</b> gene and one normal copy.

Standard surveillance (including monthly breast self-exams and mammography at the usual schedule for age) is recommended, unless additional tests are indicated because the individual has other risk factors (e.g., family history of breast cancer).|$|E

50|$|Kappei Ina, a {{local radio}} talk show host, {{allegedly}} claimed that when customers withdrew money at Michinoku automatic teller machines (<b>ATMs),</b> <b>the</b> display did not display the honorific suffix “-sama” that is often used with a company’s customers. However, <b>the</b> <b>ATMs</b> used this suffix when customers deposited money. Ina speculated {{that the reason for}} this was that those customers that deposited money into the bank were true customers, while those who withdrew money were not customers. One week after this was aired, <b>the</b> Michinoku <b>ATMs</b> displayed <b>the</b> honorific “-sama” suffix.|$|R
25|$|Looking for {{mutations}} in <b>the</b> <b>ATM</b> gene of an unrelated person (for example, the spouse of a known A-T carrier) presents significant challenges. Genes often have variant spellings (polymorphisms) {{which do not}} affect function. In a gene as large as ATM, such variant spellings are likely to occur and doctors cannot always predict whether a specific variant will or will not cause disease. Genetic counseling can help family members of an A-T patient understand what can or cannot be tested, and how the test results should be interpreted.|$|E
25|$|The group {{began to}} focus on the {{imminent}} threat of climate change and environmental after Superstorm Sandy. Linking consumerism to the global climate crisis, the group joined the growing movement in Appalachia to end mountaintop removal. In early 2010, Talen and several members of the choir traveled to Coal River Valley, West Virginia. There they met with local activists and gathered mud and dirt from mountains that had been exploded in the area, which they brought back to New York City and used in several direct actions targeting <b>the</b> <b>ATM</b> lobbies of Chase Bank, at the time the world's largest financier of mountaintop removal.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, the {{proteins}} {{expressed by the}} hMre11 (defective in ATLD) and Nbs1 (defective in NBS) genes exist in the cell as a complex, along with a third protein expressed by the hRad50 gene. This complex, known as the MRN complex, {{plays an important role}} in DNA damage repair and signaling and is required to recruit ATM to the sites of DNA double strand breaks. Mre11 and Nbs1 are also targets for phosphorylation by <b>the</b> <b>ATM</b> kinase. Thus, the similarity of the three diseases can be explained in part by the fact that the protein products of the three genes mutated in these disorders interact in common pathways in the cell.|$|E
