5|$|Mark Jerrold Henry (born June 12, 1971) is an American powerlifter, Olympic weightlifter, strongman, {{and retired}} {{professional}} wrestler, {{who is currently}} signed to WWE as a producer. He was a two-time Olympian in 1992 and 1996 and a gold, silver, and bronze medalist at the Pan American Games in 1995. As a powerlifter, he was WDFPF World Champion (1995) and a two-time U.S. National Champion (1995 and 1997) {{as well as an}} all-time raw world record holder in <b>the</b> <b>squat</b> and deadlift. Currently, he still holds the WDFPF world records in <b>the</b> <b>squat,</b> deadlift and total and the USAPL American record in the deadlift since 1995. He is credited for the biggest raw squat and raw powerlifting total ever performed by a drug tested athlete, regardless of weight class, as well as the greatest raw deadlift by an American citizen.|$|E

5|$|Although English {{furniture}} derives so extensively {{from foreign}} and especially French and Italian models, the earlier forms of English chairs owed but little to exotic influences. This was especially the case {{down to the}} end of the Tudor period, after which France began to set her mark upon the British chair. <b>The</b> <b>squat</b> variety, with heavy and sombre back, carved like a piece of panelling, gave place to a taller, more slender, and more elegant form, in which the framework only was carved, and attempts were made at ornament in new directions. The stretcher especially offered opportunities which were not lost upon the cabinet-makers of the Restoration. From a mere uncompromising cross-bar intended to strengthen the construction it blossomed, almost suddenly, into an elaborate scroll-work or an exceedingly graceful semicircular ornament connecting all four legs, with a vase-shaped knob in the centre. The arms and legs of chairs of this period were scrolled, the splats of the back often showing a rich arrangement of spirals and scrolls. This most decorative of all types appears to have been popularized in England by the cavaliers who had been in exile with Charles II, and had become familiar with it in the north-western parts of the European continent. During the reign of William III and Mary II these charming forms degenerated into something much stiffer and more rectangular, with a solid, more or less fiddle-shaped splat and a cabriole leg with pad feet. The more ornamental examples had cane seats and ill-proportioned cane backs. From these forms was gradually developed the Chippendale chair, with its elaborately interlaced back, its graceful arms and square or cabriole legs, the latter terminating in the claw and ball or the pad foot. George Hepplewhite, Thomas Sheraton and Robert Adam all aimed at lightening the chair, which, even in the master hands of Thomas Chippendale, remained comparatively heavy. The endeavour succeeded, and the modern chair is everywhere comparatively slight.|$|E

50|$|The Age of Trade, {{which lasted}} {{for almost three}} millennia, saw a {{decrease}} in the warp storms isolating the Home Worlds. <b>The</b> <b>Squats</b> traded with <b>the</b> Orks and Eldar during this period. The Age of Trade was ended in an enormous attack on the Home Worlds by the Ork Warlord Grunhag <b>the</b> Flayer. <b>The</b> <b>Squats</b> pleaded for assistance from their Eldar trading partners, but were rebuffed. This led to the Squats' enmity against Orks and Eldar that has lasted through the Age of Wars into the current Age of Rediscovery (or Age of the Imperium). The Forces of the Great Crusade launched wars against <b>the</b> <b>Squats</b> in <b>the</b> belief that they were aliens, but eventually <b>the</b> <b>Squats</b> were accepted, along with other abhumans, as being human in nature. <b>The</b> millions of <b>Squat</b> Strongholds spread across their homeworlds joined the Imperium, but continued to retain their autonomy as an independent but allied empire to the Imperium.|$|R

25|$|If a {{squatting}} toilet is built, it {{is useful}} to add handle bars for people who need support while squatting. For people with disabilities who need physical support while squatting, particularly when cleaning afterwards, a portable seat can be placed on <b>the</b> <b>squat</b> toilet to allow people to sit. When not needed, it can be moved out of the way.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{mechanism of}} ventilation in VIP latrines is {{the action of}} wind blowing {{across the top of}} the vent pipe. The wind creates a strong circulation of air through the superstructure, down through <b>the</b> <b>squat</b> hole, across the pit and up and out of the vent pipe. Unpleasant fecal odors from the pit contents are thus sucked up and exhausted out of vent pipe, leaving the superstructure odor-free. In some cases solar-powered fans are added giving a constant outwards flow from the vent pipe.|$|E

25|$|At about 1:30 am, {{the police}} attacked. A wave of about 150 {{of them in}} riot gear charged {{the western part of}} the {{barricades}} in a solid shield wall. Due to an early warning from the lookout post on top of <b>the</b> <b>squat,</b> the defenders were prepared. They bombarded the police with stones and petrol bombs, forcing them to retreat after about 10 minutes. Of the 150 police officers involved in the charge, only about 14 made it near the barricades, and about 40 police officers were injured in the attack.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} couple of days the {{situation}} tensed. Several compromises were suggested from various parts but they were all rejected by the city council. At the same time the police were beginning to prepare for a final assault against the defenders. This plan involved breaking through the barricades with armoured bulldozers acquired from the military. Several units of police were then going to charge <b>the</b> <b>squat,</b> some of them armed with submachine guns. About 1500 police had been drafted in for the assault. The police commanders stated that this assault would most likely result in the death of several people.|$|E
25|$|While {{the design}} of the Otte Round Barn is {{consistent}} with the designs found during the second phase of Stephenson County, Illinois round barn construction it does have key differences which set it apart from other similar barns. Similarities are found in the single hip roof, <b>the</b> <b>squat</b> cupola and the special rafter bracing technique. The use of salvaged materials reflects the Depression era economy during which the Otte Round Barn was constructed. These characteristic reflect the last design variation found in Stephenson County round barns. The Otte Round Barn was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1984 as part of a Multiple Property Submission.|$|E

25|$|Flies {{searching for}} an {{egg-laying}} site are attracted by fecal odors coming from the vent pipe, but they are prevented from entering by the flyscreen at the outlet of the vent pipe. Some flies may enter into the pit via <b>the</b> <b>squat</b> hole and lay their eggs there. When new adult flies emerge, they instinctively fly towards light. However, if the latrine is dark inside, the only light they can see {{is at the top}} of the vent pipe. Since the vent pipe is covered by a fly screen at the top, flies will not be able to escape and eventually will die and fall back into the pit.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Ryesgade was a nine-day {{series of}} street fights in mid-September 1986, in the Copenhagen street Ryesgade. It {{was the most}} violent event in a long-standing {{conflict}} between the Copenhagen city council and the city's community of squatters. Faced with an ultimatum to leave their illegally occupied housing or face eviction, the squatters instead fortified the streets around their building so strongly that it became a cop-free zone. They took advantage of this lack of control by burning down a building belonging to the Sperry Corporation. For nine days, massed police unsuccessfully attempted to evict the squatters. The civil disorder was of a magnitude never before seen in Denmark. After communicating a manifesto through the media, the defenders finally abandoned <b>the</b> <b>squat</b> and dispersed without being apprehended.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fire}} of 1187, the {{clerestory}} was rebuilt and the entire building given a ribbed vault. The eastern end was extended from the round ambulatory to form a square retrochoir or presbytery with lancet windows in a style that is transitional between Norman and Gothic. The newer arcades and the clerestory maintain the round arches of the earlier Norman architecture. The vault is in the Early English Gothic style, supported externally by flying buttresses and large terminal pinnacles at the eastern end. At this time the entire interior was refurbished, much of it being refaced with ashlar masonry. Each pier was decorated with delicate shafts of dark Purbeck marble with foliate capitals, contrasting with <b>the</b> <b>squat</b> cushion capitals of the limestone shafts. The entire program of work was probably directed by Walter of Coventry. The nave was later divided from the choir by an elegant Perpendicular screen or pulpitum with three arched openings, called the Arundel Screen, which was removed in the mid 19th century but reinstated in 1961.|$|E
50|$|In {{recent years}} {{there have been}} a number of public squats which have brought {{together}} the two main contemporary reasons for squatting - homelessness and activism. Examples are <b>the</b> Lafontaine <b>squat</b> in Overdale, a district of Montréal (2001), <b>the</b> Woodward's <b>Squat</b> in Vancouver (2002), <b>the</b> Infirmary <b>Squat</b> in Halifax (2002), <b>the</b> Pope <b>Squat</b> in Toronto (2002), <b>the</b> Seven Year <b>Squat</b> in Ottawa (2002), <b>the</b> Water Street <b>Squat</b> in Peterborough (2003) and the North Star hotel in Vancouver (2006). These were squats organised by anti-poverty groups which tended to have a short life expectancy.|$|R

500|$|Adult C. pagurus are nocturnal, hiding {{buried in}} the {{substrate}} during the day, but foraging at night up to [...] from their hideouts.

It may stalk or ambush motile prey, and may dig large pits to reach buried molluscs. The main predator of Cancer pagurus is the octopus, which will even attack them inside the crab pots that fishermen use to trap them.|$|E
