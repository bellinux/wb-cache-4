5|$|The {{multiplayer}} side of Mysteries of the Sith {{was received}} positively, {{but did not}} completely escape criticism. Emil Pagliarulo of The Adrenaline Vault questioned why certain features seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missing</b> from the multiplayer mode that {{were present in the}} single-player mode. One such feature is the rancor which appears prominently in a single-player level but is not in any multiplayer maps.|$|E
5|$|In Taiwan, outer {{bands of}} the storm {{produced}} significant amounts of rain over southeastern areas of the island. Along the western coast, rip currents resulted in the drowning of one person. Six hikers also were reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missing.</b> In China, torrential rains triggered flooding that destroyed 100 homes, killed one person and left six others missing. In all, seven people were killed by Linfa, with damages in mainland China estimated at ¥641million (US$93.8million) and agricultural losses in Taiwan reached NT$400million (US$12.1million).|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{set up a}} twenty-four-hour hotline {{for those}} with {{information}} on the case to call. A text hotline was also created.

A total of eighty-four billboards, including digital signs donated by Clear Channel, were also placed across the state of Massachusetts, encouraging individuals to report tips to the anonymous hotlines created for the child.|$|E

5|$|Suspicion {{continued}} to grow, and Maria's stepmother began talking of dreams that Maria {{had been murdered}} and buried in the Red Barn. On 19 April 1828, she persuaded her husband {{to go to the}} Red Barn and dig in one of the grain storage bins. He quickly uncovered the remains of his daughter buried in a sack. She was badly decomposed but still identifiable. An inquest was carried out at the Cock Inn at Polstead (which still stands today), where Maria was formally identified by her sister Ann from some physical characteristics. Her hair and some clothing were recognisable, and she was known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missing</b> a tooth which was also absent from the jawbone of the corpse. Evidence was uncovered to implicate Corder in the crime: his green handkerchief was discovered around the body's neck.|$|E
25|$|Video {{footage of}} the CIDG {{operations}} was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missing.</b> An autopsy on Espinosa's body revealed that he was shot four times, with one bullet managing to exit the body.

Two of his expensive rings were also found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missing.</b> The bullets were sent to the regional crime laboratory for further investigation.|$|E

The reigns of several Persian kings appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missing</b> from the traditional calculations.|$|E
