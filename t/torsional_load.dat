5000|$|Buell XB models also {{incorporated}} the industry's first Zero <b>Torsional</b> <b>Load</b> (ZTL) perimeter floating front disc brake system, a patented [...] "inside-out" [...] wheel/brake design {{that puts the}} brake disc on {{the outer edge of}} the wheel,rather than at the hub. This lets the suspension function better, improving control and traction, through reducing unsprung weight on the front wheel, because only a single disc and caliper - with a corresponding reduction in bolts and brake fluid - is needed compared with the conventional dual-disc brake setup on most modern sport bikes. In an exchange in the pages of Motorcyclist magazine between Suzuki engineer James Parker, creator of the GSX-RADD hub-center steering system, and Buell's Director of Analysis, Test & Engineering Process, Abraham Askenazi, Parker conceded the ZTL system's advantage in unsprung weight. But he pointed out the remaining weight is located further out on the rim where it is most detrimental to acceleration and braking, and that there were potential heat transfer issues, and the need for one fork leg to be stronger than the other. Responding, Askenazi disputed all of Parker's criticisms, saying the ZTL system was 30% lighter than the brakes on the Suzuki GSX-R1000, and that the inertia of having the weight further out on the rim, and the heat generation near the tire, were not negative factors, based on testing. Askenazi concluded that testing and race track experience had proven the ZTL to be [...] "state of the art." ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Torsional {{buckling}} of multi-walled {{carbon nanotube}} embedded in an elastic matrix subjected to thermal fields is studied using a continuum-based multilayered shell model. The model {{takes into account}} the multilayer van der Waals (vdW) interaction between any two layers of the MWCNT as radius dependent function. The elastic matrix surrounding the outermost tube is modeled as Pasternak foundation to account for not only the normal stresses, but also the shear stress between the outermost tube and the surrounding medium. The effect of inner tube radius, number of tubes, stiffness of surrounding elastic medium and temperature change on the critical <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> is examined. Numerical results show that the vdW interaction will lead to a higher critical <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> and at room or lower temperature the critical <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> for infinitesimal buckling of a multi-walled carbon nanotube increases as the value of temperature change increases, while at a temperature higher than room temperature the critical <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> for infinitesimal buckling of a multi-walled carbon nanotube decreases as the value of temperature change increases.

40|$|Background: This biomechanical {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the predictive ability of dual-energy x-ray absorpti-ometry, cortical bone geometry as determined with computed tomography, and radiography in the assessment of tor-sional load to failure in femora with and without notching. Methods: Thirteen matched pairs of cadaveric femora were randomized into two groups: a notched group, which con-sisted of femora with a 3 -mm anterior cortical defect, and an unnotched group of controls. Each pair then underwent <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> to failure. The ability of a number of measures to predict femoral <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> to failure was assessed with use of regression analysis. These measures included dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans of the proximal and the distal part of the femur, geometric measures of both anterior and posterior cortical thickness as well as the polar moment of inertia of the distal part of the femur as calculated on computed tomography scans, and the Singh os-teoporosis index as determined on radiographs. Results: The <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> to failure averaged 98. 9 N-m for the notched femora and 143. 9 N-m for the controls; the dif-ference was significant (p < 0. 01). Although several variables correlated with <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> to failure, distal femoral bone-mineral density demonstrated the highest significant correlation (r = 0. 85; p < 0. 001). Moreover, multiple regres-sion analysis showed that a combination of distal femoral bone-mineral density and polar moment of inertia calculated with the posterior cortical thickness (adjusted r 2 = 0. 79; p < 0. 001) had the strongest prediction of <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> to fail...|$|E

The theoretical model developed allows the impact on <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> capacity of a number of joint parameters to be investigated and good correlation of the results, incorporating variations in coefficients of friction and dimensions, has been shown for the two larger band sizes. For smaller diameter bands, the experimental data suggests that as the band is tightened, contact with the flange is localised rather than being over the full circumference of the band.

40|$|The {{present study}} reports {{the effects of}} {{combined}} torsional and compressive cyclic loading on trabecular bone in order to mimic true physiological conditions and thereby provides improved data that represents clinical and real life conditions. However, only compressive behaviour is evaluated in most previous studies of bone mechanics. From the monotonic evaluation, {{it is observed that}} lower stress is needed for the onset of microcrack in the sample under <b>torsional</b> <b>loading,</b> compared to the stress needed in compression. Trabecular bone samples were subjected to a combination of torsion and compression fatigue at different stress levels during which they were compared to compressive axial fatigue. The stress levels were determined by considering the monotonic strength at 25 - 50 % for both compressive and shear stresses. Significant decrease in fatigue lifetime is observed in between samples of pure compression fatigue and those with superpositioned <b>torsional</b> <b>loading</b> (p< 0. 05). The reduction in fatigue lifetime became more evident at a high torsional stress level. In this case, the failure of the sample is said to be 'torsional dominant'. Fatigue behaviour of bovine trabecular bone begins with plastic deformation, followed by strain accumulation and modulus reduction. As the strain rate increases, more energy dissipates and the sample finally failed. Further, the analysis of fractograph revealed something on the trabeculae by bending in sample with superpositioned <b>torsional</b> <b>loading.</b> In conclusion, <b>torsional</b> <b>loading</b> decreases the quality of the trabecular properties in terms of stiffness, life and structural integrity. It is hoped that results from this study will improve the understanding of the behaviour of trabecular bone under combined fatigue and help to develop future assessments of trabecular failure...|$|R

40|$|Quasi-steady {{aerodynamics}} were assumed, {{as well as}} a torsion mode {{where the}} amplitude is proportional to the distance from the rotor center. Aerodynamic torsional moment inputs are limited to the region of reverse flow where the aerodynamic center and the section center of gravity are separated by half the blade chord. Thus negligible effects of blade torsional flexibility are obtained for rotor conditions with negligible reverse flow effects. Numerical examples refer to conditions with 1. 6 rotor advance ratio. It was found that the random flapping response is only moderately affected by torsional flexibility.

40|$|<b>Torsional</b> <b>load</b> on pile {{foundations}} is induced {{by the action of}} eccentric horizontal forces on the supporting structures. Such loading not only initiates twist at the pile head, but also reduces its axial capacity significantly associated with increased settlement of the foundation. Inadequate design of piles under torsion may lead to disastrous consequences. Although several theoretical and experimental investigations have already been carried out on piles under <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> as evidenced from the available literature, there is ample scope for further contributions on the influence of <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> on pile foundation. This paper presents a novel numerical model (boundary element method) to analyze the response of a single, vertical, floating pile subjected to pure <b>torsional</b> <b>load.</b> The nonlinear stress-strain response of soil has been incorporated in the model by hyperbolic correlation, whereas the pile material has been idealized as elastic-perfectly plastic. The effect of progressive pile-soil slippage at the interface is considered. Apart from predicting the load-displacement response with incremental angle of twist of pile under pure torsion, the profiles for shear stress and angle of twist and the depth of interface slippage are some of the salient features captured by the proposed model. Validation of the model developed by comparing with existing models and experimental data indicate the suitability and accuracy of the solutions developed. However, minor discrepancies in the solution appeared owing to the simplified assumptions of perfectly plastic postpeak soil behavior and the absence of residual stress in the soil owing to pile installation. The proposed model is also applied successfully to selected case studies on concrete piles (L=D ranged from 10 - 40) in medium-soft clay, medium-dense sand, and layered soil, and a set of design curves have been constructed. 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|E
