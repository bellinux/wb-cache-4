5|$|As the NAACP {{attracted}} {{more money and}} talent, and {{became the center of}} anti-Bookerite civil rights activity, <b>Trotter</b> and the NERL became increasingly marginalized on the left. <b>Trotter</b> would not have as prominent a role in the civil rights dialogue again.

5|$|In 1872, the Dole Gudbrandsdal {{was split}} into two types - a class for heavier {{agriculture}} and driving horses and a class for lighter racing and riding horses. In 1875, the Norwegian Trotting Association was formed by enthusiasts of the second type. In 1902, the first Dole Gudbrandsdal stud book was published, containing stallions from both types born between 1846 and 1892. In 1903, the Norwegian Trotting Association split their registration between purebred Norwegian trotters and trotting crosses. At the same time, standards for entry were tightened and the first inspection committee was created. In 1965, the Norwegian or Dole <b>Trotter</b> studbook {{was taken over by}} the Norwegian Trotting Association, as part of the new Coldblood <b>trotter</b> program approved by the Norwegian Ministry for Agriculture. The Dole <b>Trotter</b> studbook is still coordinated with the original Dole Gudbrandsdal registry, and horses have to meet many of the same standards. The Dole <b>Trotter</b> is alternately considered a subtype of the Dole Gudbrandsdal and a separate breed.|$|E

50|$|Sheep's <b>trotters,</b> also {{referred}} to as lamb's <b>trotters,</b> are the feet of sheep. They may be cooked by being boiled, broiled or fried, and are used in various dishes.

Powsowdie is a Scottish sheep's heid (head) broth or soup that sometimes includes sheep's <b>trotters</b> as an ingredient. Sheep's <b>trotters</b> are used in the preparation of lamb's <b>trotters</b> soup, which can also include leg meat.

The Tennessee Walker did not figure prominently in original Missouri Fox <b>Trotter</b> pedigrees, and so the FFHA, by restricting the amount of Walker blood, is attempting to develop horses that more closely resemble the original Fox <b>Trotter</b> type.|$|E

50|$|The Guardian, under {{direction}} of the <b>Trotters,</b> often disparaged the eminence of Booker T. Washington in the public domain. Washington's ideation of working for equality without pressing for it stood in direct opposition to the <b>Trotter's</b> philosophy. Booker T. Washington himself worked tirelessly against the newspaper's agenda, which included militant civil rights promotion and other rights causes. W.E.B Dubois asked the <b>Trotter's</b> to join the recently founded NAACP, however the <b>Trotter's</b> refused over objection to the organization's white leadership.|$|R

50|$|In its {{original}} Dutch and Minahasa version, pig's <b>trotters</b> are usually employed {{as the base}} of rich and thick soup broth. The rich gelatinous pig's <b>trotters</b> gave a pleasant thick and glistening texture of the soup broth. Nevertheless, since this soup is also popular across Indonesia as everyday soup served in common Indonesian households, various versions exist. This include a halal version, which replaces pork <b>trotters</b> with cow's <b>trotters,</b> ribs or bony parts of beef. A variant called sayur asem kacang merah uses beef-based broth and tamarind-based soup similar to sayur asem to add sour freshness.|$|R
5|$|The Dole Gudbrandsdal, Dølahest or Dole is a draft- and harness-type horse from Norway. The Dole <b>Trotter</b> is {{alternately}} {{considered a}} subtype of the Dole Gudbrandsdal {{and a separate}} breed; it is also considered {{a part of the}} Coldblood <b>trotter</b> type. The Dole Gudbrandsdal is a small draft horse, known for its pulling power and agility, while the Dole <b>Trotter</b> is a smaller, faster horse used for harness racing; the two types are commonly interbred. Both types are strictly critiqued before entry into the studbook, which has over time resulted in an improvement in the breed type. The Dole is originally from the Gudbrandsdal Valley, and is probably descended in part from the Friesian horse. Over time the breed has had Thoroughbred, Arabian and other blood added in, especially during the creation of the Dole <b>Trotter</b> in the 19th century. The first studbook was created in 1941, and the current breed association formed in 1947. Although originally used mainly as a pack horse, today the heavier Dole type is used mainly for agricultural purposes. The Dole Gudbrandsdal been crossed with other breeds to develop horses for harness racing and riding.|$|E
5|$|The {{private sector}} {{was not the}} only source of racism: under President Wilson, the plight of African Americans in {{government}} jobs suffered. Many federal agencies adopted whites-only employment practices, the Army excluded blacks from officer ranks, and the immigration service prohibited the immigration of persons of African ancestry. Du Bois wrote an editorial in 1914 deploring the dismissal of blacks from federal posts, and he supported William Monroe <b>Trotter</b> when <b>Trotter</b> brusquely confronted Wilson about Wilson's failure to fulfill his campaign promise of justice for blacks.|$|E
5|$|The <b>trotter</b> type is {{the lightest}} Finnhorse. A <b>trotter</b> section horse {{should be of}} light {{conformation}} yet muscular, with a relatively long body and long legs. At the studbook evaluation, a trotter-type horse must meet the standards in racing results and/or in breeding value index as decreed by Suomen Hippos. A trotter's disposition is evaluated during the drivability test. However, type {{is not part of}} the studbook evaluation standard for trotters.|$|E

5|$|Washington countered Trotter's attacks with {{a variety}} of tactics. He took various legal actions against <b>Trotter,</b> {{including}} at least one libel suit and criminal charges. In addition, he used his network to apply pressure to Trotter's supporters in their workplaces (in some cases government and academic positions). In addition, he had other sympathizers secretly infiltrate and report on activist meetings organized by <b>Trotter</b> and others. Washington also provided financial support and expertise to start other publications in Boston to counter Trotter's radical voice. As a result of such activities, Trotter's printer dropped the activist and his newspaper as a client. But <b>Trotter</b> found another printer and continued publishing the Guardian despite the setback.|$|E

5|$|The Normandy {{region of}} France {{is well known}} for its horse breeding, having also {{produced}} the Percheron and French <b>Trotter.</b> Small horses called bidets were the original horses in the area, and these, crossed with other types, eventually produced the Carrossier Normand, the immediate ancestor of the Norman Cob. Although {{known as one of the}} best carriage horse breeds available in the early 20th century, the Carrossier Normand became extinct after the advent of the automobile, having been used to develop the French <b>Trotter,</b> Anglo-Norman and Norman Cob. In its homeland, the Norman Cob was used widely for agriculture, even more so than the internationally known Percheron, and in 1950, the first studbook was created for the breed.|$|E
