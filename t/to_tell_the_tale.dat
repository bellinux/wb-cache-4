5|$|In 2002, García Márquez {{published}} the memoir Vivir para contarla, {{the first of}} a projected three-volume autobiography. Edith Grossman's English translation, Living <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tale,</b> was published in November 2003. October 2004 brought the publication of a novel, Memories of My Melancholy Whores (Memoria de mis putas tristes), a love story that follows the romance of a 90-year-old man and a pubescent concubine. Memories of My Melancholy Whores caused controversy in Iran, where it was banned after an initial 5,000 copies were printed and sold.|$|E

He’s lived {{his life in}} darkness {{from the day he}} was born, but one fateful day everything changes — Ayreon can see images. The minstrel believes these visions are sent to him by the Lords of Time. Unaware of how much time there is left before Earth is destroyed Ayreon sets out <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>tale</b> of Earth’s demise singing songs of wars, natural disaster, and computer technology. The terrifying tales frighten the villagers who run him out of town.|$|E

25|$|Historically, the Druze in Lebanon {{managed to}} {{maintain}} for centuries a small, hardy {{community in the}} Chouf Mountains overlooking Beirut surrounded by a sea of potential enemies, both Christian and Muslim, {{and they have a}} reputation of being savage fighters known for their tenacious battle spirit. Their esprit de corps and brutal methods often convinced their opponents to flee, whilst those who decided to stay and fight never lived <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>tale.</b> However, the Lebanese Druze have also been amiable to whoever controls the Chouf region at any given time, and they were pragmatic with their dealings with foreign powers such as the Israelis, Americans and Syrians.|$|E
25|$|On 14 February 2017, Jund al-Aqsa {{executed}} {{more than}} 170 prisoners of war, including both HTS fighters, FSA fighters, and civilians. Kafr Nuboudah and Kafr Zita villages were {{the origin of}} the Jaysh Nasr members whom Liwa al-Aqsa executed according to Moussa al-Omar. The casualties given for Jaysh Nasr were : fighters: fifty six, media reporters: three, and military chiefs : eleven, according to Moussa al-Omar. After Jund al-Aqsa committed the slaughter at Khan Shaykhun, only one person lived <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>tale.</b> On the next day, HTS captured the village of Heish from Jund al-Aqsa, and then besieged the retreating Jund al-Aqsa forces in Khan Shaykhun and Murak.|$|E
25|$|Pliny and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts of the mountain, which Pliny and his friends {{attributed}} to burning villages. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected {{to take to the}} fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from rockfall. They approached the beach again but the wind had not changed. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed, escaping ultimately by land. Very likely, he had collapsed and died, which is the most popular explanation of why his friends abandoned him, although Suetonius offers an alternative story of his ordering a slave to kill him to avoid the pain of incineration. How the slave would have escaped <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>tale</b> remains a mystery. There is no mention of such an event in his nephew's letters.|$|E

David Madden, Fox's Entertainment President stated, [...] "It takes {{a very special}} team <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>tales</b> of Gotham. For the past two seasons, Bruno, Danny and John have masterfully honored the mythology of Gotham {{and brought it to}} life with depth, emotion and memorable high drama." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lenny Kaye, {{writing for}} Rolling Stone, called the album [...] "the first record that comes close <b>to</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>tale</b> of their legendary {{reputation}} and attendant charisma". In his retrospective review, Mark Deming of AllMusic called it [...] "MC5's most accessible album, but still highly idiosyncratic {{and full of}} well-written, solidly played tunes. ... while less stridently political than their other work, musically it's as uncompromising as anything they ever put to wax and would have given them much greater opportunities to subvert America's youth if the kids had ever {{had the chance to}} hear it." ...|$|R

500|$|The album {{documents}} {{the life and}} adventures of a character called Venus as she moves [...] "from a small town to a big metropolis". The band have been consistent when describing this central story of [...] "running away from relationships, breaking {{up in a small}} town, moving to the big city, losing yourself, having your innocence completely corrupted, and living <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>tale</b> as a wiser person", however, several conflicting explanations have been given for the appearance of this narrative arc. Chief songwriter Gruff Rhys has claimed that Hey Venus! was conceived as a concept album: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1999, García Márquez was {{diagnosed}} with lymphatic cancer. Chemotherapy provided by a hospital in Los Angeles proved to be successful, and the illness went into remission. This event prompted García Márquez to begin writing his memoirs: [...] "I reduced relations with my friends to a minimum, disconnected the telephone, canceled the trips {{and all sorts of}} current and future plans", he told El Tiempo, the Colombian newspaper, [...] "...and locked myself in to write every day without interruption." [...] In 2002, three years later, he published Living <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tale</b> (Vivir para Contarla), the first volume in a projected trilogy of memoirs.|$|E
500|$|Moore and Gibbons {{designed}} Watchmen {{to showcase}} the unique {{qualities of the}} comics medium and to highlight its particular strengths. In a 1986 interview, Moore said, [...] "What I'd like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating", and emphasized this by stressing the differences between comics and film. Moore said that Watchmen {{was designed to be}} read [...] "four or five times", with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings. Dave Gibbons notes that, [...] "s it progressed, Watchmen became much more about the telling than the tale itself. The main thrust of the story essentially hinges on what is called a macguffin, a gimmick [...] So really the plot itself is of no great consequence [...] it just really isn't the most interesting thing about Watchmen. As we actually came <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>tale,</b> that's where the real creativity came in." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his memoir}} Vivir para contarla (Living <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tale,</b> 2002), García Márquez {{explained}} that the novel was inspired by his grandfather, {{who was also a}} colonel and who never received the pension he was promised. [...] However, there is also speculation that García Márquez took inspiration from his experience of unemployment in 1956 after the newspaper he had been working for shut down. The daily lives he witnessed during this time are said to be one of his inspirations for this novel.|$|E
2500|$|In a postwar {{analysis}} of the unpreparedness of U.S. Army forces deployed to Korea {{during the summer and}} fall of 1950, Army Major General Floyd L. Parks stated that [...] "Many who never lived <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>tale</b> had to fight the full range of ground warfare from offensive to delaying action, unit by unit, man by man ... hat we were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat ... does not relieve us from the blame of having placed our own flesh and blood in such a predicament." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{stories are}} not told entirely from Marlow's perspective, however. There {{is also an}} omniscient narrator who {{introduces}} Marlow {{and some of the}} other characters.

2500|$|North of Theipval the Ulster Division {{broke through}} the enemy trenches, passed {{the crest of the}} ridge, and reached the point called the Crucifix, in rear of the first German position. For a little while they held the strong Schwaben Redoubt (where), enfiladed on three sides, they went on through {{successive}} German lines, and only a remnant came back <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>tale.</b> Nothing finer was done in the war. [...] The splendid troops drawn from those Volunteers who had banded themselves together for another cause, now shed their blood like water for the liberty of the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{problem was}} that since the English edition omitted the epilogue, British reviewers read a book with a first-person narrator who {{apparently}} did not survive <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>tale.</b> The reviewer in the Spectator objected that [...] "nothing should be introduced into a novel which it is physically impossible for the writer to have known: thus, he must not describe the conversation of miners in a pit if they all perish." [...] The Dublin University Magazine asked [...] "how does it happen that the author is alive to tell the story?" [...] and the Literary Gazette declared that how the writer, [...] "who {{appears to have been}} drowned with the rest, communicated his notes for publication to Mr. Bentley is not explained". A few other reviewers, who did not comment upon the apparent impossibility of Ishmael telling the story, pointed out violations of narrative conventions in other passages.|$|E
2500|$|Ayato {{is the top}} {{student at}} Seidoukan Academy, nicknamed [...] He wields the , with which he shows too high an affinity. He {{transfers}} to Seidoukan Academy to investigate his sister's disappearance and {{to figure out what}} he is supposed to do (he later says that it is to protect Julis). On his first day, he is challenged to a duel by Julis because of the embarrassing events that happen between them. During the duel, an unknown attacker shoots an arrow at Julis, but she is saved by Ayato. Before they can continue, the duel is stopped by Claudia, the student council president. Ayato also meets his childhood friend, Saya, whom he has not seen for five years. While Julis is showing Ayato and Saya around the city the next day as thanks for him saving her during the duel, Saya says that Ayato is a powerful opponent whose opponents never live <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>tale,</b> which Julis does not believe. Eventually, she realizes that Ayato is immensely powerful. Ayato often finds himself in the center of occasional embarrassing moments as Julis, Saya, Kirin and even Claudia all try to vie for Ayato's attention. He is not good at minor tweaks to his prana, but manages {{to do it in the}} Phoenix Festa finale with the help of Julis. He also has a limiter placed on him by his sister, which he can shed a little of, for a short time, but with heavy consequences. During the match with the Jie Long twins, Shenhua and Shenhyu, he manages to break another layer of the barrier, which increases the time for which he can be at full power. > says that he has a great amount of raw power.|$|E

60|$|So far, {{he knew he}} {{was safe}} enough; for Margaret was <b>the</b> last girl <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> real <b>tale</b> of her life, and her desire to avoid Maitland was strong enough to keep her silent, even had she not been {{naturally}} proud and indisposed to make confidences.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} myths {{surrounding}} the Blackfoot Native Americans {{as well as}} Aboriginal people. The Blackfeet inhabit areas of Alberta, Canada, and areas of Montana. These stories, myths, origins, and legends play {{a big role in}} their everyday life, such as their religion, their history, and their beliefs. Only the elders of the Blackfoot tribes are allowed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>tales.</b> These myths are sometimes hard {{to get a hold of}} because the elders of the tribes are often reluctant <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them <b>to</b> strangers who are not of the tribe. People such as George B. Grinnell, John Maclean, D.C. Duvall, Clark Wissler, and James Willard Schultz were able to obtain some of the stories that are so sacred to the tribes.|$|R
