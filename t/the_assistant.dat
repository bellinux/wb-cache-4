5|$|As {{with the}} Commandant, <b>the</b> <b>Assistant</b> Commandant of the Marine Corps is {{appointed}} by the President based on advice and consent of the Senate and, once appointed, will be promoted to the grade of general. The duties of <b>the</b> <b>Assistant</b> Commandant include such authority and duties as the Commandant – and {{with the approval of}} the Secretary of the Navy – may delegate to or prescribe for him. Orders issued by <b>the</b> <b>Assistant</b> Commandant in performing such duties have the same effect as those issued by the Commandant.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Assistant</b> Commandant is {{nominated}} for appointment by the President {{and must be}} confirmed via majority vote by the Senate. In {{the event that the}} Commandant is absent or is unable to perform his duties, <b>the</b> <b>Assistant</b> Commandant assumes the duties and responsibilities of the Commandant. For this reason, <b>the</b> <b>Assistant</b> Commandant is appointed to a rank equal to the sitting Commandant; since 1971, each Assistant Commandant has been, by statute, a four-star general, making it the most common rank held among Marines serving this position. Additionally, he may perform other duties that the CMC assigns to him. Historically, <b>the</b> <b>Assistant</b> Comandant has served for two to three years. In recent decades, <b>the</b> <b>Assistant</b> Commandant has frequently been a Marine aviator. James F. Amos is the first aviator to serve as Assistant Commandant and then be promoted to Commandant.|$|E

40|$|Research {{is at the}} {{forefront}} of knowledge and, hence, wealth generation, so it is timely to consider a neglected category of the research workforce, <b>the</b> research <b>assistant.</b> <b>The</b> research <b>assistant</b> has traditionally been part of the fabric, if not the structure, of university research efforts but despite the extent of the contribution, the breadth of skills and the depth of qualifications often brought to the position of research assistant, there is no overt professional pathway articulated for these research workers. Equally, there is an implicit, if not overt lack of recognition of <b>the</b> research <b>assistant</b> role in processes of knowledge generation. This lack of recognition is reflected in the difficulty of defining <b>the</b> research <b>assistant</b> role and articulating how it differs across disciplines. This paper considers <b>the</b> research <b>assistant</b> in <b>the</b> current research landscape and culture of Australian universities, providing background to a wide-ranging empirical study of <b>the</b> research <b>assistant</b> workforce exploring <b>the</b> experience of <b>the</b> research <b>assistant</b> and <b>the</b> significance of <b>the</b> research <b>assistant</b> role in knowledge generation. 10 page(s...|$|R
