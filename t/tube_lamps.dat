2500|$|Performers such as [...] "Dr. Resisto", [...] "The Human Dynamo", [...] "Electrice", [...] "The Great Volta", and [...] "Madamoiselle Electra" [...] {{would have}} their body {{connected}} to the high voltage terminal of a hidden Tesla coil, causing sparks to shoot from their fingertips {{and other parts of}} their body, and neon lights and fluorescent <b>tube</b> <b>lamps</b> to light up when brought near them. They could also light candles or cigarettes with their fingers. Although they didn't usually cause electric shocks, RF arc discharges from the bare skin could cause painful burns; to prevent them performers sometimes wore metal thimbles on their fingertips (Rev. Moon, center image above, is using them). These acts were extremely dangerous and could kill the performer if the Tesla coil was misadjusted. In carny lingo this was called an [...] "electric chair act" [...] because it often included a spark-laced [...] "electrocution" [...] of the performer in an electric chair, exploiting public fascination with this exotic new method of capital punishment, which had become the United States' dominant method of execution around 1900. Today entertainers still perform high voltage acts with Tesla coils, but modern bioelectromagnetics has brought a new awareness of the hazards of Tesla coil currents, and allowing them to pass through the body is today considered extremely dangerous.|$|E

The detector {{is based on}} project “muon detector” presented on website www. astroparticelle. it. The idea is to use 2 fluorescent <b>tube</b> <b>lamps.</b> When a muon hits the detector, it ionizes some atoms of gas of the lamp. Putting an electric tension (order of 1 kV) outside the tube with electrodes spaced 10 cm each other, the ionized atom goes toward one electrode. If ionized atom hit glass produces lamp, as internal surface of these lamps are coated with fluorescent powder. First step is looking lamp with human eyes. Second step: we would automatize muons detection. To observe lamps we put a light sensor for each sector of the detector (the sections are 5 for each tube).

The apparatus is controlled by a microcontroller board Arduino. To measure cosmic ray flux at different altitudes the detector will be uplift with a balloon filled with helium gas.

40|$|Results of {{ultraviolet}} (UV) B phototherapy can {{be improved}} by the application of calcipotriol, but {{studies are needed to}} decide how the two treatments should be combined. We studied the effect of UVB after application of calcipotriol ointment (50 microg g- 1) and calcipotriol cream (50 microg g- 1) and determined the optimal time of application of calcipotriol when combined with UVB phototherapy (280 - 350 nm), in a single-blinded randomized vehicle-controlled study of 37 healthy adult volunteers. Calcipotriol ointment or cream was applied randomly on five areas on the back at different time intervals from UVB irradiation. One area was left untreated as the control. Application times were the evening before, the morning before, 2 h before, immediately before, and immediately after irradiation. UVB irradiation was administered by TL 20 W/ 12 fluorescent <b>tube</b> <b>lamps</b> at increasing doses (20, 25, 32, 40, 50 and 64 mJ cm- 2) to six subunits of each test area. Clinical assessment was performed 24 h after UVB irradiation by a blinded investigator. Calcipotriol ointment and cream were applied in 19 and 18 subjects, respectively, and erythema was measured for each application time quantified. We found that erythemal reactions were significantly smaller when calcipotriol ointment or cream was applied immediately before irradiation compared with all other application times. To explain these findings, a vehicle control study was performed. No difference in erythema was seen between calcipotriol medication and the vehicle controls. Spectrophotometric analysis of the calcipotriol cream and ointment showed no UV absorbance in the UVB range. No signs of photosensitization were noted. In conclusion, the vehicles of the calcipotriol ointment and cream inhibit the induction of erythema by UVB irradiation if applied immediately before phototherapy. Consequently, calcipotriol ointment and cream should not be applied directly before UVB irradiation; however, they may be applied at any time up to 2 h prior to or immediately after UVB irradiation.

40|$|Light largely {{influences}} the biological world. It {{is used by}} organisms for several purposes. However, the influence of artificial light on species interaction, populations and ecosystems is not well documented. Also, technical and political measures are not used consistently. This study will examine how and to what extend artificial light affects Lepidoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera and insectivorous bat species and also provide for measures to reduce potential negative effects. There are some limitations to the study, since only specific insect and bats species of the European Union are taken into consideration. Also, only measures for the EU are given and long-term effects are not examined. Insects and bats can see different wavelengths of light. Both bats and insect species use light for partitioning of activity between day and night, dark repair and recovery, circadian clocks and photoperiodism, visual perception and spatial orientation. Artificial light is mainly produced by lamps. The outdoor artificial light is mostly used in urban and western areas in the world. High pressure sodium, low-pressure sodium, high-pressure mercury, metal halide, compact fluorescent, LED, incandescent/Halogen and fluorescent <b>tube</b> <b>lamps</b> are most commonly used outdoor, as street lamps. The effect of those types of lamps varies. For insects and bats, street lamps can {{have an effect on}} their daily rhythm and several physiological processes. Artificial light affects individuals, but it also has an effect on populations and ecosystems. Literature to provide for examples of this phenomenon is very scarce. Artificial light can affect the population itself, by increasing the mortality or reproduction rate, but it can also change the interaction between species of the same family or even predator-prey relationships. For some species with small and fragmented populations, artificial light could cause local extinction. Also, some species that are favoured by artificial light could outcompete another species. Four different scenarios for the effect of artificial light on the predator-prey relationship between bats and insects are considered. However, the possible differences in effect between insect species or bat species is not taken into consideration. Light pollution can be defined as being the degradation of the photic habitat by artificial light. Even though there are still huge gaps in the knowledge about the effect of artificial light at night on these specific species, the knowledge that already has been retrieved is worrying. Light pollution has the potential to disrupt the stability of species and some literature shows that light pollution is already an important factor in the decline of some vulnerable species. There are some studies that have determined limit values for light pollution and some formulas are conducted in the past years. However, these findings have not yet been integrated in EU laws and legislations. When countries individually develop these regulations, this could create economical unequal environments for companies and individuals, thereby undermining the open economy principle of the EU. Since artificial light is a potential problem for the biological world, it is important that further steps are taken concerning guidelines for the use of artificial light in the EU. There are several technological and political measures that are suitable for EU regulations. These measures can be integrated in a plan specifically set up for the species examined in this study. However, other organisms should also be included in these guidelines. Therefore, further research on the effect on other species is needed...|$|E

2500|$|The {{alkali metal}} ions {{are small and}} mobile; their {{presence}} in glass allows a degree of electrical conductivity, especially in molten state or at high temperature. Their mobility decreases the chemical resistance of the glass, allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion. Alkaline earth ions, with their two positive charges and requirement for two non-bridging oxygen ions to compensate for their charge, are much less mobile themselves and also hinder diffusion of other ions, especially the alkalis. The most common commercial glasses contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions (usually sodium and calcium), for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance. Corrosion resistance of glass can be increased by dealkalization, removal of the alkali ions from the glass surface by reaction with e.g. sulfur or fluorine compounds.
