50|$|Each {{turn the}} active player draws five cards {{from their own}} deck of cards into <b>their</b> <b>hand.</b> The player to start the game only draws three cards into <b>their</b> <b>hand,</b> to limit any inequalities from being the {{starting}} player. When it is their next turn they draw five cards to <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> as per usual.|$|R
50|$|In turn, {{each player}} compares <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> to the {{community}} pile. If a card in <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> matches one of the cards in the community pile the player can collect the card and place both the card from <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> and the card from the community in a separate pile of cards won, the suit of the card does not come into play.|$|R
50|$|Players {{must always}} end their turn with 6 tiles in <b>their</b> <b>hand,</b> {{so if they}} place tiles during their turn, they draw random tiles to build <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> back up to 6.|$|R

5|$|Karlheinz Stockhausen {{employed}} {{noise in}} vocal compositions, such as Momente (1962–64/69), {{in which the}} four choirs clap <b>their</b> <b>hands,</b> talk, and shuffle their feet, in order to mediate between instrumental and vocal sounds {{as well as to}} incorporate sounds normally made by audiences into those produced by the performers.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} rules {{can also lead}} to games, {{especially}} heads-up, becoming tactical, with players avoiding making <b>their</b> best <b>hand</b> until <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> is forced into that last exchange by another player sticking, risking that the card that completes <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> isn't taken by another player in the meantime.|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} rule about melding is that {{a player}} cannot meld {{in such a way}} so that the cards left in <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> would put them over 75 points. For example, a player starts the hand with 63 points. They can only meld if they will have 12 or fewer points left in <b>their</b> <b>hand.</b> Moreover, whenever they draw/discard they must ensure <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> stays under 12 points.|$|R

5|$|Slow lorises have a {{powerful}} grasp with both <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.|$|E

5|$|According to the Earps' {{version of}} events, {{the fight was}} in self-defense because the Cowboys, armed in {{violation}} of local ordinance, aggressively threatened the lawmen and defied a lawful order to hand over their weapons. The Cowboys maintained that they raised <b>their</b> <b>hands,</b> offering no resistance, and were shot in cold blood by the Earps. Sorting out who {{was telling the truth}} was difficult and remains so.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of its {{formation}} in 1921, the KJRM obtained four former Austro-Hungarian s that had been converted into minesweepers.

50|$|Most {{basketball}} players slide <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> {{to one side}} of the ball when dribbling to better control the ball, directing it from left to right and vice versa. So long as the ball does not come to rest this is perfectly legal. Moreover, dribbling this way allows more control and easier ball-handling. The problem arises when the ball-handler slides <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> too far down the side of the ball, having <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> below the ball. This is when the player is in violation and a carrying violation has been committed.|$|R
50|$|Players must trade <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> to {{the left}} once.|$|R
50|$|Instead {{of playing}} a card from <b>their</b> <b>hand,</b> players {{also have the}} option of playing in the dark by playing the top card of the stock instead of a hand card. In this case they do not draw a card when the trick is over, as <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> is already complete.|$|R
5|$|Baptism in the Holy Spirit occurs {{elsewhere}} in Acts. The gospel had been proclaimed in Samaria and the apostles Peter and John were sent from Jerusalem. The new believers had been baptized in water, but the Holy Spirit {{had not yet}} fallen on them. The Samaritans received the Holy Spirit when Peter and John laid <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> on them. The Apostle Paul was also filled with the Holy Spirit when Ananias of Damascus laid hands on him, and afterwards Paul was baptized with water.|$|E
5|$|Both armies used child soldiers, mainly between 14 and 17 {{years of}} age. The usage of {{juvenile}} soldiers was not rare in World War I; {{children of the}} time were under the absolute authority of adults and generally were not shielded against exploitation. In the Finnish case, the military leaders took whoever they could get <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> on, at the less organised start of the war. In the Red Guards there was the chance for salary and food.|$|E
