5|$|As {{the entire}} album was {{recorded}} and played by Anderson, {{the only option}} was to record the music in layers. First, he recorded the drums, using a drum kit. However, he was unhappy with the way <b>they</b> <b>sounded,</b> and so re-recorded on a drum machine. The next layers to be recorded were the guitar, bass and vocals, with other sounds being added later.|$|E
25|$|Linguistic {{profiling}} {{also applies}} to gender and sexual orientation. Munson conducted a study in which naïve listeners were asked to distinguish between heterosexual male and female speakers, and gay male and bisexual or lesbian female speakers. He found that listeners tended to classify male and female speakers by masculinity and femininity, respectively; male speakers were perceived as gay if <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> less masculine, while female speakers were identified as bisexual or lesbian if <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> less feminine.|$|E

25|$|That {{meant no}} {{interchangeable}} lines as in troubadour poetry and fewer repetitions: for a French jongleur who sang his poems these were necessary, but <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> redundant to the Sicilian authors. Their poetry was {{music to the}} eye, not to the ear, and their legacy is also apparent in Dante and Petrarch's lyrics. The sonnet is even more exacting on this point: the separation between the octave and the sestet is purely a logical one, the rimes drawing a visual line {{between the first and}} last part. However, the fact that Italian poetry was being made for the reading public may have facilitated its circulation.|$|E
25|$|Having incautiously underwritten a friend’s research, Mr Fuller {{was made}} {{bankrupt}} in 1908, and Walter (who was editing periodicals in London) became financially {{responsible for the}} family. He had always encouraged his eldest sister to collect and learn folksongs; in 1911, she and Rosalind visited Cecil Sharp, the great collector of folksongs, and sang him some. He was entranced and immediately had them demonstrate for him, first at the Festival of Empire {{and then at the}} Stratford-upon-Avon Summer School of Folksong and Dance. Visiting Americans exclaimed how charming <b>they</b> <b>sounded,</b> and they formed a project of going to the United States to perform over there.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, the United States {{was happy}} and prosperous {{in various ways}} (leading to the {{nickname}} Roaring Twenties), but it also suffered from rapid change and social tensions. Some people were disenchanted by, and alienated from, the outside world. Many common people believed that World War I had resulted in extensive and largely senseless carnage, and they supported isolationism for the US. According to scholar Peter Rollins (1976), Rogers {{appeared to be an}} anchor of stability; his conventional home life and traditional moral code reminded people of a recent past. His newspaper column, which ran from 1922 to 1935, expressed his traditional morality and his belief that political problems were not as serious as <b>they</b> <b>sounded.</b> In his films, Rogers began by playing a simple cowboy; his characters evolved to explore the meaning of innocence in ordinary life. In his last movies, Rogers explores a society fracturing into competing classes from economic pressures. Throughout his career, Rogers was a link to a better, more comprehensible past.|$|E

Coldplay never aspire to that; on one hand <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> British {{but on the other}} <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> like a huge global artist."

This included an engagement at the Musica Viva series in San Francisco and concerts with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington D.C. and the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra. [...] "I {{spoke to the}} audiences," [...] Copland writes, [...] "with humorous accounts of the work's adverse effect on droves of letter writers, who had heard the original performance, in person or on TV. Then I asked the brass section to illustrate the opening chords, and the strings how <b>they</b> <b>sounded.</b> Before they knew it, the audience was sympathetic. My purpose was not to sell the work but to demonstrate it." ...|$|E
500|$|By June 2002, {{the band}} had {{completed}} A Rush of Blood to the Head, but thought their output sounded [...] "rubbish" [...] and {{reached an agreement}} with the label to postpone the release of the album until they were completely satisfied. Subsequently, many songs were discarded because <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> like they could have been on Parachutes. Martin has claimed {{that it would have been}} uninteresting: [...] "It would have shown that we're happy to sit back on what we'd done, and we're not. For us, it was important to progress and try to improve upon our abilities as musicians." [...] Such ambitions put the band under strain: [...] "sometimes practice sessions ended abruptly with one or more members of Coldplay threatening to quit".|$|E
500|$|At the outset, Byrne was {{hesitant}} to add lyrics to the tracks because <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> {{too much like}} folk music. He characterized the process as very slow and full of trepidation, {{in part because of}} expectations from their previous collaboration and also due to the strict division of labor they had between writing instrumentation and vocalization. Eno only provided a few vocal demos and suggested simple changes like adding an extra verse. Byrne made minimal changes to the instrumentation on several tracks and avoided changing chords in the melody to suit his singing style. The duo only worked in the studio together on two occasions, including one full week and a weekend on another occasion and neither partner got a veto in the process of track selection or production. According to Byrne, the main challenge in this writing technique [...] "was more emotional than technical: to write simple heartfelt tunes without drawing on cliché." ...|$|E

500|$|Mikael Wood of Spin {{gave the}} album six stars out of ten, saying it [...] "contains plenty of aggressively arty material" [...] and calling [...] "The Messenger" [...] the [...] "most {{unexpected}} track on the boldly conceived A Thousand Suns". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B rating and said [...] "at times the band's odd mélange of industrial grind, hip-hop swagger, and teenage-wasteland angst feels jarring". Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone gave it three stars out of five; he said Linkin Park were [...] "feeling {{their way toward}} a new identity"; he called their skill for melody [...] "obvious" [...] and said <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> like [...] "a killer Linkin Park tribute band". Australia's Music Network magazine gave the album a mixed review, calling it [...] "a radical shift for the band, but it’s also a very uneven one...while there's some commanding moments ('The Catalyst,' 'Wretches and Kings'), many of the tracks feel like experiments rather than formed songs".|$|E
500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{called it}} [...] "anthemic" [...] and noted the song {{would become a}} future single. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice called [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] the {{highlight}} of the album, and said [...] "get ready for [...] to score your summer." [...] However, Juzwiak went on to note that Spears' vocals are heavily manipulated to maximize the chorus's potential, even though [...] "the joy she sings about is palpable." [...] The Chicago Sun-Times journalist Thomas Conner also noted that the singer's vocals were processed to the point [...] "these songs could be sung by anyone", exemplifying I Wanna Go' tweaks her up so high she could be Jackie Evancho." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent also criticized the singer's vocals on Femme Fatale, stating that <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> more programmed than natural, with [...] "even the little whistling hook in 'I Wanna Go' has a synthetic character about it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Deal and Donelly {{recorded}} a demo with violinist Carrie Bradley of Ed's Redeeming Qualities, bassist Ray Holiday, and four different drummers. The demo had a country music feel. Paul Kolderie engineered {{several of the}} songs, but Deal felt <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> [...] "too clean"; she asked Joe Harvard (of Fort Apache Studios) to remix the tracks to sound rougher. Deal called the project [...] "the Breeders", a name {{that she and her}} sister Kelley had used when performing as teenagers; this was a slang expression—used by homosexuals to refer to heterosexuals—that Deal found amusing. Around the time the Breeders recorded the demo, the group performed a concert at the Rat music venue in Boston; in the city's Phoenix newspaper, the band was described as a female supergroup. Ivo Watts-Russell—the cofounder of 4AD, the record label of the Pixies and Throwing Muses—heard the Breeders' demo, and was very enthusiastic about it. Watts-Russell offered funding to rerecord the songs for an album release, and the band received an $11,000 budget.|$|E

500|$|After {{the more}} {{produced}} Rings Around the World, which {{relied heavily on}} computers and electronics, the group were keen to make Phantom Power [...] "a little more human" [...] with guitarist Huw Bunford stating: [...] "with technology {{you can do anything}} these days, but sometimes less is more". Many songs on the album are acoustic based and bass player Guto Pryce has claimed that <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> [...] "pretty good right from the start" [...] which also contributed to the decision to avoid [...] "over-tweak them in the studio". Despite this the group did work electronic loops into several tracks after Ciaran bought a large number of [...] "sound effect and light music" [...] vinyl records from a man who worked in the same building. According to Rhys: [...] "he knocked on the door just as we were beginning the album: [...] "hey, I've got these records to sell, are ya interested?" [...] And Cian went down to check them out and gave him a hundred pounds on the spot and carried 700 albums back to our tiny room".|$|E
500|$|Of seven {{children}} born to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart, only the fourth, Maria Anna (Nannerl), born 31 July 1751, and the youngest, Wolfgang Amadeus, born 27 January 1756, survived infancy. The children were educated at home, under Leopold's guidance, learning basic skills in reading, writing, drawing and arithmetic, together with some history and geography. Their musical education was aided by exposure to the constant rehearsing and playing of Leopold and his fellow musicians. When Nannerl was seven her father began to teach her to play the harpsichord, with Wolfgang looking on; according to Nannerl's own account [...] "the boy immediately showed his extraordinary, God-given talent. He often spent long periods at the clavier, picking out thirds, and his pleasure showed that <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> good to him... When he {{was five years old}} he was composing little pieces which he would play to his father who would write them down". A family friend, the poet Johann Andreas Schachtner, recounted that at the age of four Wolfgang began to compose a recognisable piano concerto, and was able to demonstrate a phenomenal sense of pitch.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of April 20, Royal Navy sailors went to the Williamsburg powder magazine, loaded fifteen half barrels of powder into the governor's wagon, and transported it to {{the eastern end of}} the Quarterpath Road to be loaded aboard the Magdalen in the James River. [...] The act was {{discovered}} by townsfolk while underway, and <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> an alarm. Local militia rallied to the scene, and riders spread word of the incident across the colony. [...] Dunmore had as a precaution armed his servants with muskets, and it was only the calming words of Patriot leaders, including the Speaker of the House of Burgesses, Peyton Randolph, that prevented the assembling crowd from storming Dunmore's mansion. [...] The city council demanded the return of the powder, claiming it was the property of the colony and not the Crown. [...] Dunmore demurred, stating that he was moving the powder as protection against its seizure during a rumored slave uprising, and would eventually return it. [...] This seemed to satisfy the assembled crowd, and it dispersed peacefully.|$|E

500|$|Romeo Void has {{generally}} been classified as a new wave or post-punk band. Some critics have noted dance elements in the music. According to Stewart Mason, writing for Allmusic, [...] " [...] band's muscular blend of Joy Division's atmospherics and the Gang of Four's rattling momentum, with Benjamin Bossi's splattering free jazz saxophone coloring everything, made Romeo Void {{one of the strongest}} of the American post-punk bands. The St. Petersburg Times wrote that they [...] "had no trouble creating a signature sound for [...] scratchy guitar, soulful sax, [...] tight, precise drums." [...] The New York Times stated that <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> like [...] "an art-school band, with its textural complexity [...] touches of jazz and funk" [...] Saxophone player Benjamin Bossi has been observed as the ingredient that [...] "set the band apart" [...] and showed a [...] "talent for both improvisation and arrangement." [...] Alan Niester, writing for The Globe and Mail, said that he weaved [...] "in and out [...] like a snake charmer" [...] and reminded him of Andy Mackay, a saxophonist that played with Roxy Music.|$|E
500|$|The Zooropa {{album was}} {{released}} in July 1993, halfway through the Zooropa leg of the tour. Of the 157 shows the band played during the Zoo TV Tour, approximately 30 of them were {{after the release of}} Zooropa. Many of the album's songs found permanent places in the shows' set lists. [...] "Lemon" [...] and [...] "Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car" [...] were performed with Bono in his MacPhisto persona, during encores of the Zoomerang Leg of the tour. [...] "Dirty Day" [...] was also played on this leg after the acoustic set. [...] "Numb" [...] was performed with The Edge playing guitar and on lead vocals, with Mullen performing backing vocals while drumming. [...] "Zooropa" [...] was played only three times and [...] "Babyface" [...] twice more at the same shows on the Zooropa leg, but they were cut out of the set list after the band were displeased with how <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> live. [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was performed acoustically for the Zooropa and Zoomerang legs.|$|E
500|$|Sora {{was planned}} as an {{artificial}} intelligence from the start, but because Uchikoshi thought robots seemed cliche, and holograms {{could not move}} around to different places, {{he came up with}} the idea of her being an image shot onto people's eyes with a laser; thinking that if a layman like himself could come up with the idea of such technology, an expert in the field could have been working on developing it already, so he researched it and found out about retinal scanning display technology, and made use of it in the game's story. The full names of both the original You and her clone were taken from a name dictionary, and were initially challenged by KID's marketing team, who thought <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> [...] "lame"; they relented after Nakazawa explained that the names had a meaning and could not be changed. Because Uchikoshi liked the film Interview with the Vampire, he conceived Tsugumi as being a vampire; the staff did not like this idea, so it was scrapped, but the concept of her being immortal was kept, which led to the introduction of the Curé Virus in the story, as Uchikoshi considered the spreading of vampirism similar to a virus. Another remnant of the vampire concept was kept in Sara, who has infrared vision and can see in the dark. Sara was noted by Uchikoshi as being the otherwise single [...] "normal" [...] person in the cast, offsetting the balance; because of this, she was made into the Kid's twin sister.|$|E
