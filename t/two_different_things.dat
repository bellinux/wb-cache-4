5|$|In Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī's (973–1048) Shadows, {{non-uniform}} {{motion is}} described {{as the result of}} acceleration. Ibn-Sina's theory of mayl tried to relate the velocity and weight of a moving object, a precursor of the concept of momentum. Aristotle's theory of motion stated that a constant force produces a uniform motion; Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī (c. 1080 – 1164/5) disagreed, arguing that velocity and acceleration are <b>two</b> <b>different</b> <b>things,</b> and that force is proportional to acceleration, not to velocity.|$|E
25|$|In Guyana, a rolled-out thin flat dough like a roti that is deep-fried in ghee {{is called}} a puri, and is only made for Hindu {{religious}} gatherings. Therefore, a dhalpuri {{is not really a}} puri, as a puri and a roti are <b>two</b> <b>different</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aristotle's {{theory of}} motion stated that a {{constant}} force produces a uniform motion, Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī contradicted this and developed his own theory of motion.

25|$|The close {{connection}} between the interpretationalist hypothesis and a holistic conception of beliefs {{is at the root}} of the notion of the dependence of perception on theory, a central concept in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Kuhn maintained that the perception of the world depends on how the percipient conceives the world: two scientists who witness the same phenomenon and are steeped in two radically different theories will see <b>two</b> <b>different</b> <b>things.</b> According to this view, our interpretation of the world determines what we see.|$|E
25|$|Split-screen credits {{are also}} used to allow for network promos (as of the 2009-10 season, the show's own stylized {{production}} credits are displayed rather than a network-generated uniform credit sequence). On some shows, including The Simpsons and Family Guy, there are special closing credits that may use additional scenes or special music that is altered or lost when Global uses a split screen. While the use of split-screen credits is common among networks in Canada and the U.S., how Global treats one program and how the U.S. network treats the same episode may be <b>two</b> <b>different</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E

25|$|This {{criticism}} {{is similar to}} the critic levelled at development in developing countries by authors such as James C. Scott, James Ferguson, and L. Lohman. Although peacekeeping and development are <b>two</b> <b>different</b> <b>things,</b> the logic behind the {{criticism is}} the same. The third-party officials-whether they are peacekeepers or agents of development-are isolated from the general populace, believing they know what is best, and refusing to gather information from a ground level. This is not out of maliciousness or imperialism, but out of a legitimate belief that they, as educated officials with access to other experts and who are well versed in development and peacekeeping literature, know what is best.|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{tendency}} to confuse the project success with project management success. They are <b>two</b> <b>different</b> <b>things.</b> Project management success criteria is different from project success criteria. The project management is said to be successful if the given project is completed within the agreed upon time, met the agreed upon scope and within the agreed upon budget. Meanwhile, a project is said to be successful, when it succeeds in achieving the expected business case.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{solution}} {{was found by}} authors such as Enrico Fermi (1922), Paul Dirac (1938) Fritz Rohrlich (1960), or Julian Schwinger (1983), who {{pointed out that the}} electron's stability and the 4/3-problem are <b>two</b> <b>different</b> <b>things.</b> They showed that the preceding definitions of four-momentum are non-relativistic per se, and by [...] changing the definition into a relativistic form, the electromagnetic mass can simply be written as [...] and thus the 4/3 factor doesn't appear at all. So every part of the system, not only [...] "closed" [...] systems, properly transforms as a four-vector. However, binding forces like the Poincaré stresses are still necessary to prevent the electron from exploding due to Coulomb repulsion. But {{on the basis of the}} Fermi–Rohrlich definition, this is only a dynamical problem and has nothing to do with the transformation properties any more.|$|E
2500|$|They largely {{function}} as a distinct class, and so distinguish themselves by using language inaccessible to people outside the academy, with more or less deliberately exclusionary effects. In Chomsky's view {{there is little reason}} to believe that academics are more inclined to engage in profound thought than other members of society and that the designation [...] "intellectual" [...] obscures the truth of the intellectual division of labour: [...] "These are funny words actually, I mean being an 'intellectual' has almost nothing to do with working with your mind; these are <b>two</b> <b>different</b> <b>things.</b> My suspicion is that plenty of people in the crafts, auto mechanics and so on, probably do as much or more intellectual work as people in the universities. [...] There are plenty of areas in academia where what's called 'scholarly' work is just clerical work, and I don't think clerical work's more challenging than fixing an automobile engine—in fact, I think the opposite.... So if by 'intellectual' you mean people who are using their minds, then it's all over society" [...] (Understanding Power, p.96).|$|E

2500|$|Machiavelli's best-known book Il Principe {{contains}} several maxims concerning politics. Instead of {{the more}} traditional target audience of a hereditary prince, it concentrates {{on the possibility of}} a [...] "new prince". To retain power, the hereditary prince must carefully balance the interests of a variety of institutions to which the people are accustomed. By contrast, a new prince has the more difficult task in ruling: He must first stabilise his newfound power in order to build an enduring political structure. Machiavelli suggests that the social benefits of stability and security can be achieved in the face of moral corruption. Machiavelli believed that public and private morality had to be understood as <b>two</b> <b>different</b> <b>things</b> in order to rule well. As a result, a ruler must be concerned not only with reputation, but also must be positively willing to act immorally at the right times. Machiavelli believed as a ruler, it was better to be widely feared than to be greatly loved; A loved ruler retains authority by obligation while a feared leader rules by fear of punishment. [...] As a political theorist, Machiavelli emphasized the occasional need for the methodical exercise of brute force or deceit including extermination of entire noble families to head off any chance of a challenge to the prince's authority.|$|E

Hampp said that Cossom's rap gave the song a [...] "street edge". It takes the listener on an emotional journey according to The Honesty Hour. The next song, [...] "Down on Love", is a midtempo production featuring another classic sample, this time the 1987 song [...] "Rock Steady" [...] by American R group The Whispers.

2500|$|Williams {{was born}} in the central Texas town of San Angelo. After {{attending}} school through tenth grade, during 1929 he enlisted with the US Merchant Marine. He served for ten years before quitting to marry Lasca Foster. Having trained as a radioman during his seafaring career, Williams worked as an electronics inspector, first for RCA in Galveston, Texas, later at Puget Sound Navy Yard in Washington State through the end of World War II. He and his wife then relocated to San Francisco, where he worked for Mackay Radio company until the publication of his first novel, Hill Girl, during 1951. It was a great success, and Williams spent the remainder of his professional career as an author, primarily of novels, with several screenplays also to his credit. The couple changed residences frequently and apparently spent considerable time in France, where Williams's work has an excellent reputation. After the death of his wife from cancer during 1972, Williams purchased property on the California-Oregon border where he lived alone for a time in a trailer. Ultimately relocating to Los Angeles, Williams committed suicide in his apartment in the Van Nuys neighborhood during early April 1975. Williams had been depressed since the death of his wife, and his emotional state worsened as sales of his books declined as pulp thrillers began to lose popularity in the early 70s. He was survived by a daughter, Alison. Many sources continue to repeat the false rumor that Williams died by drowning in the Gulf of Mexico or in France. There {{is no such thing as}} a [...] "pulp paperback." [...] They are <b>two</b> <b>different</b> <b>things.</b> Paperbacks were never printed on pulp. Pulp magazines got their name from being printed on pulp.|$|E

Depending {{on the game}} style, team and player points can reflect <b>two</b> {{completely}} <b>different</b> <b>things.</b> Player points are usually earned through an individual player's accomplishments that help the team as a whole. Player points are earned by setting and deploying equipment, repairing friendly assets, destroying enemy assets, defending friendly assets, and completing objectives of the game.|$|R
