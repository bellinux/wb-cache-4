2500|$|In the San Francisco Chronicle, John Carman wrote [...] "It's cross-generational, warm-the-cockles viewing, and it's {{a terrific}} show. Can this really be the WB, niche {{broadcaster}} to horny mall rats?" [...] Caryn James of The New York Times {{called it a}} [...] "witty, charming show" [...] that [...] "is redefining family in a realistic, entertaining way for today's audience, all the while avoiding the sappiness that makes sophisticated viewers run from anything labeled a 'family show.'" [...] Ray Richmond of The Hollywood Reporter declared it [...] "a genuine gem in the making, a family-friendly hour unburdened by trite cliche or precocious pablum," [...] while Jonathan Storm of The Philadelphia Inquirer dubbed it [...] "a touching, funny, lively show <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> appeal to all ages". David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun called Gilmore Girls [...] "One of the most pleasant surprises of the new season".|$|E
2500|$|Arrows {{episode of}} the {{crossover}} is also the series' 100th. Guggenheim felt Berlanti [...] "came {{up with an idea}} <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> allow us to have our cake and eat it too" [...] in terms of respecting Arrow as a whole, while incorporating it into the crossover, adding [...] "It is a love letter to the show. It draws on all previous 99 episodes, pretty much. Everyone who we could have in the episode from a scheduling point of view is in the episode. Even the people who we couldn't have because of conflicting schedules are represented." [...] At the end of The Flash episode, Oliver, Thea, Sara, Diggle, and Ray are captured by the Dominators and are held in a stasis, with their minds occupied in a [...] "shared hallucination", which allowed the writers [...] "to revisit footage from the previous 99 episodes" [...] in the memory flashes the characters experience.|$|E

60|$|The {{thing that}} really is trying to tyrannise through {{government}} is Science. The thing <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> use the secular arm is Science. And the creed that really is levying tithes and capturing schools, the creed that really is enforced by fine and imprisonment, the creed that really is proclaimed not in sermons but in statutes, and spread not by pilgrims but by policemen--that creed is the great but disputed system of thought which began with Evolution and has ended in Eugenics. Materialism is really our established Church; for the Government will really help it to persecute its heretics. Vaccination, in its hundred years of experiment, has been disputed {{almost as much as}} baptism in its approximate two thousand. But it seems quite natural to our politicians to enforce vaccination; and it would seem to them madness to enforce baptism.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{only wish}} I could write in some {{tolerable}} good style, so that I could idealize, or rather realize to folks, {{the life and}} love, and marriage of a working man and his wife. It is in my opinion a working man <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> know what a true wife is, for his every want, his every comfort in life depends on her; and his children's home, their daily lives and future lives, are shaped by her. Napoleon wisely said, 'France needs good mothers more than brave men. Good mothers are the makers or shapers of good and brave men.' I cannot say {{that these are the}} words, but it is the import of his speech on the topic. We have a saying amongst us: 'The man may spend and money lend, if his wife be ought,'--i. e. good wife;--'but he may work and try to save, but will have nought, if his wife be nought,'--i. e. bad or thriftless wife.|$|E
60|$|But {{that is only}} a {{preliminary}} statement; it still leaves untouched all the considerations advanced in the former part of this discussion to show how easily the complications and difficulties of voting lead to a falsification of the popular will and understanding. But here we enter a region where a really scientific investigation has been made, and where established results are available. A method of election was worked out by Hare {{in the middle of}} the last century <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> seem to avoid or mitigate nearly every falsifying or debilitating possibility in elections; it was enthusiastically supported by J.S. Mill; it is now advocated by a special society--the Proportional Representation Society--to which belong men of the most diverse type of distinction, united only by the common desire to see representative government a reality and not a disastrous sham. It is a method which does render impossible nearly every way of forcing candidates upon constituencies, and nearly every trick for rigging results that now distorts and cripples the political life of the modern world. It exacts only one condition, a difficult but not an impossible condition, and that is the honest scrutiny and counting of the votes.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was a kind}} of lost paradise ... There was an old mill <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> grind corn {{with two}} millers, a great big pond with swans on it, a sandpit, a {{wonderful}} dell with flowers, a few old-fashioned village houses and, further away, a stream with another mill. I always knew it would go — and it did.|$|R

6000|$|The {{only thing}} in {{question}} {{is the quality of}} the thing they got. There is something highly maddening in the circumstance that when modern people attack an institution <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> demand reform, they always attack it for the wrong reasons. Thus many opponents of our public schools, imagining themselves to be very democratic, have exhausted themselves in an unmeaning attack upon the study of Greek. I can understand how Greek may be regarded as useless, especially by those thirsting to throw themselves into the cut throat commerce which is the negation of citizenship; but I do not understand how it can be considered undemocratic. I quite understand why Mr. Carnegie has a hatred of Greek. It is obscurely founded on the firm and sound impression that in any self-governing Greek city he would have been killed. But I cannot comprehend why any chance democrat, say Mr. Quelch, or Mr. Will Crooks, I or Mr. John M. Robertson, should be opposed to people learning the Greek alphabet, which was the alphabet of liberty. Why should Radicals dislike Greek? In that language is written all the earliest and, Heaven knows, the most heroic history of the Radical party. Why should Greek disgust a democrat, when the very word democrat is Greek? ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the same}} time, as I said before, {{do not let}} us forged our own faults. Do not let us forget them any the more easily {{because they are the}} {{opposite}} to the German faults. Modern England is too prone to present the spectacle of a person who is enormously delighted because he has not got the contrary disadvantages to his own. The Englishman is always saying [...] "My house is not damp" [...] at the moment when his house is on fire. The Englishman is always saying, [...] "I have thrown off all traces of anæmia" [...] {{in the middle of a}} fit of apoplexy. Let us always remember that if an Englishman wants to swindle English people, he does not dress up in the uniform of a soldier. If an Englishman wants to swindle English people he would as soon think of dressing up in the uniform of a messenger boy. Everything in England is done unofficially, casually, by conversations and cliques. The one Parliament <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> rule England is a secret Parliament; the debates of which must not be published--the Cabinet. The debates of the Commons are sometimes important; but only the debates in the Lobby, never the debates in the House. Journalists do control public opinion; but it is not controlled by the arguments they publish--it is controlled by the arguments between the editor and sub-editor, which they do not publish. This casualness is our English vice. It is at once casual and secret. Our public life is conducted privately. Hence it follows that if an English swindler wished to impress us, the last thing he would think of doing would be to put on a uniform. He would put on a polite slouching air and a careless, expensive suit of clothes; he would stroll up to the Mayor, be so awfully sorry to disturb him, find he had forgotten his card-case, mention, as if he were ashamed of it, that he was the Duke of Mercia, and carry the whole thing through with the air of a man who could get two hundred witnesses and two thousand retainers, but who was too tired to call any of them. And if he did it very well I strongly suspect that he would be as successful as the indefensible Captain at Koepenick.|$|E

At the same time, Denis Dyack was inspired by media reports that video games were [...] "messing with people's heads" [...] "So, we thought, wouldn't it {{be a good idea to}} make something <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> mess with people's heads?" ...|$|E

In a front page review for The Los Angeles Times, Gary Indiana said it was, [...] "A gracefully written tell-all <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> tell a story worth reading... Her detailed book is hardly prurient, but it does clock -- and I do mean clock -- JFK's infidelities, which emerge here in a somewhat different light than we've seen them before...Grace and Power is stuffed with resonant names from yesteryear...Smith's portrait of Jackie is irresistible." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Dr. Matthew Bonnan, a {{co-author}} on the study, [...] "We {{already knew}} that the earliest sauropods and near-sauropods would be bipeds. What Aardonyx shows us, however, is that walking quadrupedally and bearing weight {{on the inside of}} the foot is a trend that started very early in these dinosaurs, much earlier than previously hypothesized." [...] Bonnan adds, [...] "On a scientific level, it's really fulfilling to have a hypothesis on how you think dinosaurs got large, then to test that in the field and get back these kind of data — a new dinosaur — <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> start to fill in some of those anatomical gaps." ...|$|E

5000|$|Roger Greenspun was {{dissatisfied}} {{with what he}} termed the [...] "general inconsequence" [...] that the script evokes. However, Greenspun expressed that Chaplin's performance was [...] "so reticent and so appealing as to constitute a small personal triumph. She is granted the film's only moments of quiet intelligence. She fills these moments with delicate intimacy that contrasts with {{everything else in the}} film <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> suggest a reservoir of feeling to oppose the lives around her that are wasted in mere action." [...] Time magazine noted the standout performances of Donald Pleasence as the Head of British Intelligence and Vladek Sheybal as a minor agent.|$|E
5000|$|At first, {{the contestants}} are not {{explicitly}} {{told that the}} bachelor is Prince Harry; they are merely led to make that inference on their own by Hicks' close resemblance, the royal setting of Englefield House, the lavish dates, and being surrounded by real professional servants and a security detail <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> have experience protecting heads of state. Hicks is {{referred to in the}} contestants' presence only as [...] "Sir."

5000|$|In UK terminology, {{this method}} of working on simple branch lines was {{originally}} referred to as One Engine in Steam (OES), and later One-Train Working (OTW). However the system was used on long through lines as well; R H Dutton, Chairman of the London and South Western Railway explained in 1876 the slow journey time between Exeter and Plymouth by saying, [...] "the cause of the delay is the stopping at every station on the staff system. <b>That</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> cause a great delay because if the staff is not there, the train must stop while a man is sent on a horse to get it {{the other end of}} the section"; quoted in Williams.|$|E
