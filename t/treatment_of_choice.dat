5|$|Given with {{chloroquine}} or quinine, clindamycin {{is effective}} and well tolerated in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, {{and is the}} <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> for pregnant women who become infected in areas where resistance to chloroquine is common. Clindamycin {{should not be used}} as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very effective as such, because of its slow action. Patient-derived isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from the Peruvian Amazon have been reported to be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by in vitro drug susceptibility testing.|$|E
5|$|The <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> {{for this}} {{condition}} is the surgical application of epidural blood patches, {{which has a}} higher success rate than conservative treatments of bed rest and hydration. Through the injection of a person's own blood into {{the area of the}} hole in the dura, an epidural blood patch uses blood's clotting factors to clot the sites of holes. The volume of autologous blood and number of patch attempts for patients is highly variable. One-quarter to one-third of SCSFLS patients do not have relief of symptoms from epidural blood patching.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has {{a higher risk of}} recurrence than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E

25|$|Drugs {{of choice}} for the {{treatment}} of bacterial vaginosis include metronidazole and clindamycin. The <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> for bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant women include metronidazole oral twice daily for seven days, or metronidazole gel intravaginally once daily for five days, or clindamycin intravaginally at bedtime for seven days. For pregnant women, the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> is metronidazole oral three times a day for seven days. Data does not report routine treatment of male sexual partners.|$|E
25|$|Tetracyclines are broad-spectrum {{antibiotics}} whose general usefulness {{has been}} reduced {{with the onset of}} antibiotic resistance. Despite this, they remain the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> for some specific indications.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{introduction}} of combination therapy with concurrent rituximab and cladribine therapy has shown excellent results in early follow-up. As of 2016, this therapy is considered the first-line <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> for many people with HCL-V.|$|E
40|$|With College and Government {{support the}} Quality Assurance Project is {{developing}} a series of explicit and detailed <b>treatment</b> outlines <b>of</b> major psychiatric disorders for use in peer review. Three sources of information are used: a meta-analysis <b>of</b> the <b>treatment</b> outcome literature, the opinions of a sample of practising psychiatrists and the views of a panel of nominated experts. The present outline concerns the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> depressive disorders. The three sources of information were in agreement that tricyclic and allied antidepressants were the <b>treatments</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> for endogenous depression and were also {{to be considered in}} persistent neurotic depressions. Electroconvulsive therapy was recommended in patients with endogenous depression who were severely ill, troubled by hallucinations and delusions or for whom the antidepressant drugs had not proven effective. The psychotherapies, both dynamic and behavioural, were regarded as the <b>treatments</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> in neurotic depression...|$|R

25|$|Kidney transplants are the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> for end-stage kidney disease, {{which is}} one of the {{complications}} of lupus nephritis, but the recurrence of the full disease is common in up to 30% of people.|$|E
25|$|Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) {{block the}} gastric {{hydrogen}} potassium ATPase (H+/K+ ATPase) and inhibit gastric acid secretion.

50|$|Effective {{antibiotics}} include most macrolides, tetracyclines, ketolides, and quinolones. Legionella multiply {{within the}} cell, so any effective treatment must have excellent intracellular penetration. Current <b>treatments</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> are the respiratory tract quinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin) or newer macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin). The antibiotics used most frequently have been levofloxacin, doxycycline, and azithromycin.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In {{patients}} with colorectal cancer (CRC), {{the most frequent}} metastatic site is the liver. In resectable cases liver resection is usually performed, while different treatment modalities including, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, vein embolization, and local destruction with cryotherapy or radiofrequency ablation represent the <b>treatments</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> in unresectable cases.

25|$|The current <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> is the {{intravenous}} administration of dantrolene, {{the only known}} antidote, discontinuation of triggering agents, and supportive therapy directed at correcting hyperthermia, acidosis, and organ dysfunction. Treatment must be instituted rapidly on clinical suspicion of the onset of malignant hyperthermia.|$|E
25|$|A {{complete}} radical, surgical, en bloc resection of the cancer, is the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> in osteosarcoma. Although about 90% {{of patients}} {{are able to}} have limb-salvage surgery, complications, particularly infection, prosthetic loosening and non-union, or local tumor recurrence may cause {{the need for further}} surgery or amputation.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{ivermectin}} {{is effective}} in eradicating scabies, often in a single dose.

25|$|Tetracyclines {{remain the}} <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> for infections caused by {{chlamydia}} (trachoma, psittacosis, salpingitis, urethritis and L. venereum infection), Rickettsia (typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), brucellosis and spirochetal infections (borreliosis, syphilis and Lyme disease). In addition, {{they may be}} used to treat anthrax, plague, tularemia and Legionnaires' disease. They are also used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Defibrillation is the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> for {{ventricular}} fibrillation (VF) and ventricular tachycardia resulting in cardiac arrest. However, amiodarone {{has been used}} in shock-refractory VF. The 2010 guidelines of the American Heart Association included amiodarone as a second line agent (after epinephrine or vasopressin). They believed that amiodarone was more effective than lidocaine in VF or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, DES {{was found}} to be more {{effective}} than androgens in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. DES was the hormonal <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women until 1977, when the FDA approved tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator with efficacy similar to DES but fewer side effects.|$|E
40|$|Malignant tumors of {{the breast}} arising from the {{connective}} tissue of the gland are rare and underestimated. Three new cases are here reported: 1 malignant fibrous histiocytoma and 2 malignant phylloides tumors. Tumor size, mammographic findings and cytologic aspect of the needlebiopsy lead to the correct diagnosis. Large excision or radical mastectomy are <b>treatments</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> while axillary lymph nodes dissection does not appear justified, since metastatic spread via lymphatics is rare. Postoperative radiation and chemotherapy seem not effective in preventing local recurrences...|$|R

30|$|Aortic {{emergencies}} {{are relatively}} rare, {{but they have}} to be detected very quickly. CTA is the imaging method <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> and helps to decide whether elective, urgent or emergent treatment is necessary.

25|$|For {{management}} of clinically active Graves' disease, orbitopathy (clinical activity score >2) {{with at least}} mild to moderate severity, intravenous glucocorticoids are the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> usually administered {{in the form of}} pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. Studies have consistently shown that pulse intravenous methylprednisolone is superior to oral glucocorticoids both in terms of efficacy and decreased side effects for managing Graves' orbitopathy.|$|E
25|$|Activated {{charcoal}} is the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> {{to prevent}} poison absorption. It is usually administered {{when the patient}} is {{in the emergency room}} or by a trained emergency healthcare provider such as a Paramedic or EMT. However, charcoal is ineffective against metals such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, and alcohols and glycols; it is also not recommended for ingestion of corrosive chemicals such as acids and alkalis.|$|E
25|$|Cefalexin is {{a useful}} {{alternative}} to penicillins in patients with penicillin intolerance. For example, penicillin is the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> for respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus, but cefalexin {{may be used as}} an alternative in penicillin-intolerant patients. Caution must be exercised when administering cephalosporin antibiotics to penicillin-sensitive patients, because cross sensitivity with beta-lactam antibiotics has been documented in up to 10% of patients with a documented penicillin allergy.|$|E
40|$|Vulva is an {{uncommon}} localization for basal cell carcinomas. We report three cases and review the literature. There {{is often a}} long delay before patients seek medical attention for these lesions. Moreover the clinical aspect is often indistinctive and misleading. The gross polymorphism of vulvar neoplasms therefore calls for biopsy of any suspicious areas. Surgical excision or Moh's chemotherapy are the <b>treatments</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> for vulvar basal cell carcinomas. The recurrence rate remains quite high even when the lesion looks completely resected. Peer reviewe...|$|R
25|$|Nifedipine, {{sold under}} the brand names Adalat among others, is a {{medication}} used to manage angina, high blood pressure, Raynaud's phenomenon, and premature labor. It is one <b>of</b> the <b>treatments</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> for Prinzmetal angina. It {{may be used}} to treat severe high blood pressure in pregnancy. Its use in preterm labor may allow more time for steroids to improve the baby's lungs and time to transfer the mother to a well qualified medical facility before delivery. Nifedipine is taken by mouth and comes in fast and slow release formulations.|$|R
