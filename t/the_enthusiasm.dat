5|$|Through Henley, Rodin met Robert Louis Stevenson and Robert Browning, in whom {{he found}} further support. Encouraged by <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> of British artists, students, and high society for his art, Rodin donated a {{significant}} selection {{of his works}} to the nation in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{benefiting from}} {{large numbers of}} {{campaign}} contributions from individual donors, and the efforts of tech-savvy supporters determined to keep his name a frequent topic of discussion on the internet, {{over the course of}} the campaign Paul was unable to translate <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> of his core supporters into large enough numbers of actual primary votes to unseat his rivals.|$|E
5|$|Noether spoke quickly—reflecting {{the speed}} of her thoughts, many said—and demanded great {{concentration}} from her students. Students who disliked her style often felt alienated. Some pupils felt that she relied too much on spontaneous discussions. Her most dedicated students, however, relished <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> with which she approached mathematics, especially since her lectures often built on earlier work they had done together.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for relics continued, and foundations' {{prestige}} {{was greatly}} increased by success in obtaining {{the remains of}} important saints. The period between the Benedictine Reform and the Norman Conquest saw the most lavish donations of land to monasteries of any period in medieval England, and the leading reformed foundations became immensely wealthy, retaining their status after the Conquest. Monasteries founded in the Anglo-Saxon period enjoyed greater prosperity and prestige than post-Conquest establishments.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Shostakovich {{concentrated}} on composition and soon limited his performances primarily {{to those of}} his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, the pieces were not critically acclaimed with <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> granted to the First.|$|E
5|$|Vandersteen, liberated of {{the work}} on the daily comic, started on a comic series based on one of the novels he had read as a youth: Robert en Bertrand, the story of two Flemish tramps at the fin de siècle. The series debuted in De Standaard in 1972. The series was the first in a long time to renew <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> of Vandersteen, and the {{graphical}} quality and the stories were a lot better than most of the Studio production of the time.|$|E

5|$|As {{a person}} of {{multiple}} talents, Siddiqui was also a refined poet, musician, and a painter. In August 1924, he held his first international exhibition of paintings in Frankfurt. Later in 1927, his works of art were exhibited at the Uzielli Gallery, Frankfurt. During his stay in Germany, he also translated Rainer Maria Rilke's poetry into Urdu, {{which was published in}} the journal of Jamia Millia Islamia. Though, his passion for arts was superseded by <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> in scientific research, he continued to patronise arts and culture. In 1966, he was at the forefront for setting up the Central Institute of Arts and Crafts in Karachi. He also compiled a selection of poetry of Mir Taqi Mir into Intekhab-e-Meer. In 1983, he published a portfolio collection of charcoal drawings from 1920 to 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{hoped to}} remain out of {{politics}} {{in order to pay}} off the debts he had incurred during the Panic, but when the Republican state convention nominated him for governor in 1875, he accepted. The campaign against Democratic nominee William Allen focused primarily on Protestant fears of the possibility of state aid to Catholic schools. Hayes was against such funding and, while he was not known to be personally anti-Catholic, he allowed anti-Catholic fervor to contribute to <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for his candidacy. The campaign was a success, and Hayes was returned to the governorship by a 5,544-vote majority. The first person to earn a third term as Governor of Ohio, Hayes reduced the state debt, re-established the Board of Charities, and repealed the Geghan Bill, which had allowed for the appointment of Catholic priests to schools and penitentiaries.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, after {{selling his}} share of the law practice, Malone {{returned}} to Stratford. He started his own law firm in partnership with another practitioner. With a reduced work load, he began focus on his other interests, which included the military. Malone participated in New Zealand's militia, the Volunteer Force. In 1900, he helped raise the Stratford Rifle Volunteers, one of many units formed in <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for the military during the Second Boer War, with himself as its captain. When he moved to New Plymouth in 1903, he relinquished his command. As a result of a request by his Volunteer Force battalion commander, Malone was made adjutant of the 4th Battalion of the Wellington (Taranaki) Rifle Volunteers. In 1905 he was second-in-command and by 1910, and now a lieutenant-colonel, he was the commander of the battalion.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} how much support there was for {{persecution}} within the aristocracy. After Gallienus's peace, Christians reached high ranks in Roman government. Diocletian appointed several Christians to those positions himself, {{and his wife}} and daughter may have been sympathetic to the church. There were many individuals willing to be martyrs, and many provincials willing to ignore any persecutory edicts from the emperors as well. Even Constantius was known to have disapproved of persecutory policies. The lower classes demonstrated little of <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> they had shown for earlier persecutions. They no longer believed the slanderous accusations that were popular in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Perhaps, as the historian Timothy Barnes has suggested, the long-established Church had become another accepted part of their lives.|$|E
5|$|Many factors {{contributed to}} the Song's {{repeated}} military blunders and subsequent loss of northern China to the Jurchens. Traditional accounts of Song history held the venality of Huizong's imperial court responsible for {{the decline of the}} dynasty. These narratives condemned Huizong and his officials for their moral failures. Early Song emperors were eager to enact political reforms and revive the ethical framework of Confucianism, but <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for reforms gradually died after the reformist Wang Anshi's expulsion as chancellor in 1076. Corruption marred the reign of Huizong, who was more skilled as a painter than as a ruler. Huizong was known for his extravagance, and funded the costly construction of gardens and temples while rebellions threatened the state's grip on power.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair-Burgess {{retired from}} the {{military}} in 1937, having served six years as Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces. On his retirement, the position was abolished. Following {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War he offered his services to the New Zealand government but this was turned down despite <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> of Edward Puttick, the Chief of Staff at the time. A carpenter in his youth, he built a house for himself at Mahina Bay, near Wellington. It was destroyed in a fire in 1959, along with all his belongings.

5|$|The Americans {{planned to}} have the K-25 plant in full {{production}} by June or July 1945. Having taken two years to get the prototype stages working, the British experts regarded this as incredibly optimistic, and felt that, barring a miracle, it {{would be unlikely to}} reach that point before the end of 1946. This opinion offended their American counterparts and dampened <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for cooperation, and the British mission returned to the United Kingdom in January 1944. Armed with the British Mission's report, Chadwick and Oliphant were able to persuade Groves to reduce K-25's enrichment target; the output of K-25 would be enriched to weapons grade by being fed into the electromagnetic plant. Despite the British Mission's pessimistic forecasts, K-25 was producing enriched uranium in June 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{tone of the}} Seattle {{campaign}} against Initiative Thirteen was different from those in Miami and St. Paul; it focused consistently on privacy and civil rights. Instead of educating the public about different subcultures in the gay community, they printed effective posters showing an eye peeping through a keyhole and a family living in a fishbowl. High-profile liberal figures, labor unions, and other large organizations including the Church Council of Greater Seattle opposed Initiative Thirteen. David Estes did not have <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> and momentum modeled by Bryant and other communities though his campaign used many of their tactics. On election day, Initiative Thirteen was rejected by 63%.|$|E
5|$|Weaver privately {{supported}} Bryan's {{quest for}} the Democratic nomination in 1896, which their convention awarded him on the fifth ballot. When the Populist convention gathered the next month in Chicago, they divided between endorsing the silverite Democrat and preserving their new party's independence. Weaver backed the former course, holding the issues the party stood for to be of more importance than the party itself. A majority of delegates agreed, but without <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> that had marked their convention of four years earlier. At the same time, Weaver joined with anti-fusionists to keep the Populist platform from deviating from the party's ideological principles. Against the fusion candidate stood Republican William McKinley of Ohio, a hard-money conservative. Bryan succeeded in uniting the South and West, Weaver's longtime dream, but with the more populous North solidly behind McKinley, Bryan lost the election.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{the stadium}} gained {{national}} attention when the visiting New York Giants committed 11 false start penalties. Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren attributed the penalties to <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> and {{noise from the}} crowd. He dedicated the ball {{used to make the}} game-winning field goal to the fans, and it is now displayed at the stadium. The Giants' general manager, Ernie Accorsi, asked an NFL senior vice president whether the Seahawks had broadcast artificial crowd noise over the public address system during this game. The NFL sent a memorandum early in the 2006 season about such complaints and sent officials to monitor two games. Holmgren denied the allegations, and the crowd responded by being even louder than usual when the Giants returned to CenturyLink Field. Since 2005 the Seahawks have tracked the number of false starts committed by visiting teams and display the statistic on a scoreboard to motivate the crowd. As of 2013, the stadium has had a league-high number of false starts since. In preparation for 2005–06 NFC Championship Game at CenturyLink Field, the Carolina Panthers practiced with the recorded sounds of jet engines in the background to prepare for the volume of the crowd.|$|E
5|$|News of {{the rescue}} was {{released}} to the public on February 2. The feat was celebrated by MacArthur's soldiers, Allied correspondents, and the American public, as the raid had touched an emotional chord among Americans concerned about the fate of the defenders of Bataan and Corregidor. Family members of the POWs were contacted by telegram to inform them {{of the rescue}}. News of the raid was broadcast on numerous radio outlets and newspaper front pages. The Rangers and POWs were interviewed to describe the conditions of the camp, as well as the events of the raid. <b>The</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> over the raid was later overshadowed by other Pacific events, including the Battle for Iwo Jima and the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The raid was soon followed by additional successful raids, such as the raid of Santo Tomas Civilian Internment Camp on February3, the raid of Bilibid Prison on February4, and the raid at Los Baños on February23.|$|E
5|$|The MR grew steadily, {{extending}} its {{own services}} and acquiring other local railways {{north and west}} of London. In 1872 Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was appointed Chairman. A director of many railway companies, he wanted to unify a string of companies to create a single line from Manchester via London to an intended Channel Tunnel and on to France. In 1873 Watkin negotiated {{to take control of}} the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the section of the former Buckinghamshire Railway north from Verney Junction to Buckingham. He planned to extend the MR north from London to Aylesbury and extend the Tramway southwest to Oxford, creating a route from London to Oxford. Rail services between Oxford and London were poor, and although still roundabout, the scheme would have formed the shortest route from London to Oxford, Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford-upon-Avon. The Duke of Buckingham was enthusiastic and authorisation was sought from Parliament. Parliament did not share <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> and in 1875 the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire Union Railway Bill was rejected. Watkin did receive consent in 1881 to extend the MR to Aylesbury.|$|E
