500|$|Veteran {{video game}} cover {{illustrator}} Marc Ericksen painted the North American box art, which included Mega Man firing a pistol {{instead of his}} trademark Mega Buster. Ericksen explained, [...] "I didn't know anything about Mega Man, and [...] I said to the art director, 'What is he shooting with?' ... He said, 'Well, he must have a pistol, because I don't see a rifle.' ... I said, 'So, a pistol? Do {{you want me to}} do a pistol?' And he said, 'Yeah, let's put a pistol in there.' So I did what I was told and I put the pistol in there. Add to the fact that they only had, like, a day and a half for me to do the painting and what you wound up with was not the greatest result. But certainly a result that was not my fault. I mean, <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> put the pistol in his hand!" ...|$|E

I landed on a planet that I identified as Saturn... they teleported me and I was down on [...] stage with them. They wanted to talk with me. They had one little antenna on each ear. A little antenna over each eye. They talked to me. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stop [...] because {{there was going to}} be great trouble in schools... the world was going into complete chaos... I would speak , and the world would listen. That's what they told me.|$|E

5000|$|Erin Gruwell is {{the woman}} who began the Freedom Writers and {{compiled}} her students’ stories into The Freedom Writers Diary. She started teaching {{in the fall of}} 1994 at Woodrow Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach, California. In interviews, she has said that she thinks she is the one who changed the most. “Everything I was told not to do, I did. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> smile. I smiled. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> never <b>to</b> show emotion. How could I not be a person, though? How could I not be compassionate and give a student a hug when they were hurting? I changed the most. I became the student.” ...|$|R

2500|$|Two years later, Clark {{began making}} {{allegations}} {{about his relationship}} with Abdul. Clark stated in his E-book, <b>They</b> <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> Tell the Truth, So...: The Sex, Lies and Paulatics of One of America's Idols, and in a May 2005 interview with ABC's Primetime Live that Idol judge Paula Abdul took him under her wing, beginning on December 12, 2002, and coached him on how to succeed in the competition, including helping him select the right songs, clothes, and hairstyle, {{in order to avoid the}} show's [...] "exploitation" [...] of young hopefuls' careers like himself, and that this mentorship developed into a three-month-long sexual relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Kenseth {{started out}} his {{season with a}} {{promising}} race in the Daytona 500. He led 40 laps in the waning stages in the race. He took the white flag to start the final lap, but was passed by teammate Denny Hamlin and Martin Truex, Jr.. Kenseth's attempt at blocking backfired as he went sideways and lost several positions. Kenseth finished 14th while Hamlin edged Truex to the stripe to win the closest finish in the race's history. One week later in the Atlanta race, he was tagged for [...] "improper fueling" [...] during a green flag pit stop {{and was forced to}} serve a pass-through penalty. He was given the black flag with the white cross marks for not pitting within three laps. After serving that penalty, he ended up in 31st two-laps down. After the race, he said [...] "I got black-flagged for some type of pit road penalty and I didn’t know it and pitted the lap <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do a pass through – I'm assuming they were black flagging us before that and they pulled our card. I never heard anything about it or at least saw the flag or anything, so I came when <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come and I guess they must have penalized us a couple laps or something. I don’t really know. I haven’t really seen it.” However, Kenseth did go on to finish 19th. He finished 37th at Las Vegas after being involved in a multi-car wreck with Chase Elliott, Kurt Busch, and Carl Edwards late in the race.|$|E
2500|$|Corey Clark {{was also}} disqualified {{from the show}} because, {{according}} to the Idol producers, Clark had a police record he had not disclosed to the show. [...] However, in 2005, contestant Corey Clark alleged {{in an interview on}} ABC's Primetime Live and in a book, <b>They</b> <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> Tell the Truth, So... The Sex, Lies and Paulatics of One of America's Idols, that he and judge Paula Abdul had an affair while he was on the show and that this contributed to his removal. Clark also alleged that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show and tips on song choice. [...] A subsequent investigation by an independent counsel hired by Fox [...] "could not corroborate the evidence or allegations provided by Mr. Clark or any witnesses". [...] Paula Abdul was therefore considered exonerated but an [...] "enhanced non-fraternization policy" [...] was put in place after the investigation.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{members of}} the Rocko's Modern Life staff created other {{successful}} ventures. Stephen Hillenburg pitched SpongeBob SquarePants to Nickelodeon in 1997. Murray said of the pitch, [...] "If it goes well, it'll be a blessing to us all." [...] The network bought the show, which premiered in 1999, {{and it became a}} popular, critical and financial success, and one of the biggest shows on Nick. Hillenburg stated that he [...] "learned a great deal about writing and producing animation for TV" [...] from his time on Rocko's Modern Life. Two writers for the series, Dan Povenmire and Jeff [...] "Swampy" [...] Marsh, went on to create Phineas and Ferb for the Disney Channel; the show became a ratings success and received numerous award nominations. When Murray returned with a new animated series, Camp Lazlo, in 2005, much of the former staff of Rocko's Modern Life joined him. Murray stated that [...] "We always kept in touch and <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> look them up if I ever did another project", adding that the crew already knew his sensibilities and an extra decade worth of experience. Carlos Alazraqui, who played Rocko, also ended up playing the main character of Lazlo. Derek Drymon and Nick Jennings, both part of the staff, went on to be responsible for the tone and visual looks of a lot of very successful animated series that came later.|$|E

60|$|But in the morning, {{a little}} before the flood was made, I was called out of my cabin to see an army, as <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> coming <b>to</b> attack us. I turned out hastily enough, as may be easily conjectured, and such an army {{appeared}} as no ship was ever attacked with; for we spied three or four hundred black creatures, come playing and tumbling down the stream towards us, like so many porpoises in the water. I was not satisfied at first that they were human creatures, but would have persuaded our men, that they were sea-monsters, or fishes of some strange kind.|$|R

60|$|Another half-hour {{brought us}} to about a dozen native shafts in the usual chimney shape.
