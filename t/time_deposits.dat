In its rediscounting actions the BNA was not engaged in pure lender of last resort actions, following Bagehot's principle of lending freely at a penalty rate.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study are (1) to analyse the condition of third party deposit outstanding, its interest rate, and cost of fund set up by PT. BNI (Persero) Tbk; (2) to analyse effect of third party deposit interest rate to third party deposit outstanding; and (3) to recommend to management an appropriate third party deposit interest rate which is able to optimize composition of third party deposit. Methodology used in this study is descriptive with a case study approach. The study applies Descriptive Analysis and Multiple Linear Regression analysis as the analysis tools. The study shows that, in general, third party deposit interest rate in BNI has experienced a down turn {{over the last three years}} (2002 – 2004) for all deposit. The declining trend of interest rate was followed by a change in composition of current <b>deposit,</b> saving, and <b>time</b> <b>deposit.</b> On one hand, <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> tended to decrease, on the other hand current deposit indicated an up turn. Finally, the change in this third party deposit composition had an impact of declining BNI cost of fund over that time. Based on result of regression analysis, variables which influenced significantly to <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> are rupiah denominated <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> interest rate and foreign currency denominated time deposi interest rate. The variable which influenced significantly to saving is foreign currency denominated <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> interest rate.

Design/methodology/approach – The analysis consists of two main elements. First element is the identification and selection of significant macroeconomic variables that determine return volatility of mudharabah <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> in Indonesian Islamic bank industry. Second element is the implementation of appropriate ANNs model according to neural networks properties, and model evaluation based on simulated return predictions of mudharabah <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> product in Bank Syariah Mandiri (RR-BSM). Findings – It is shown that monthly changes of return can be predicted quite well. The model provides a satisfactory result in forecasting RR-BSM for 12 months ahead with 95. 22 per cent accuracy. These results suggest that the ANNs can be applied as an adequate tool to help depositors in predicting future return of mudharabah <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> product.

None of the surviving records mention anything but <b>time</b> <b>deposits</b> (for the purposes of raising capital), so they generally did not offer demand accounts and maintain the interest by lending out a portion of the deposits.

The Medici bank was not a banco a minuto, although between 1476 and 1491, Francesco di Giuliano de' Medici (14501528) was involved in two that dealt heavily in jewelry (one of whose partnership contracts explicitly state that as a goal, though the more successful one dealt in all sorts of luxuries like Spanish tuna).

Such bills could be a hidden and legal method to create loans bearing interest. The Medici Bank was such a bank. One Medici branch manager (Tommaso Portinari) said: [...] "The foundation of the [...] business rests on trade in which most of the capital is employed." [...] Similarly, the articles of association frequently said {{something along the lines of}} the purpose for the partnership being [...] "to deal in exchange and in merchandise with the help of God and good fortune." [...] Under Cosimo, the Bank had interests in wool, silk, alum and merchant vesselsentirely separate from the many financial instruments and relations it managed. Despite their membership in the Arte del Cambio (assuming they bothered to run a local bank in Florence itself), these merchant banks' focus were determinedly international in scope, where profits could be found, local markets being very competitive. Sometimes these banks were referred to as gran tavoli ("big table") or variants thereof, due to their origins as banchi in mercato; the difference between them and banchi grossi was more one of degree than kind.|$|E
