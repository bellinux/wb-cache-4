5|$|A European innovation, castles {{originated}} in the 9thand 10thcenturies, {{after the fall of}} the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes. These nobles built castles <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the area immediately surrounding them, and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as protection from enemies. Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies, the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. Urban castles were used <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the local populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community, such as mills, fertile land, or a water source.|$|E

40|$|Many {{proteins}} bind <b>to</b> <b>controlled</b> pore glass; {{they are}} either acid elutable or alkali elutable. Mouse interferon is an acid-elutable protein. Since poly(L-lysine) and, to some extent, poly(L-arginine) are also eluted from controlled pore glass under acidic conditions, one may postulate that mouse interferon binds <b>to</b> <b>controlled</b> pore glass via some of the protein's epsilon-amino groups (of lysine) and/or guanidinium groups (of arginine) and the beads' silanol (hydroxyl groups). The necessity of lysine in the binding of interferon <b>to</b> <b>controlled</b> pore glass is further substantiated {{by the fact that}} citraconylated interferon does not bind <b>to</b> <b>controlled</b> pore glass. A requirement for Lewis acid-base interaction between the beads' B 2 O 3 groups and the amide groups of arginine is unlikely in view of the results obtained with the alternative system, ZrOH, which, being devoid of B 2 O 3, did bind interferon. Since a substantial amount of interferon could be eluted from controlled pore glass with ethylene glycol and high salt, one may assume that some hydrophobicity is involved in the binding of interferon <b>to</b> <b>controlled</b> pore glass. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Although a {{small number}} of castles had been built in England during the 1050s, after the conquest the Normans began to build timber motte and bailey and ringwork castles in large numbers <b>to</b> <b>control</b> their newly {{occupied}} territories. During the 12th century the Normans began to build more castles in stone, with characteristic square keeps that supported both military and political functions. Royal castles were used <b>to</b> <b>control</b> key towns and forests, whilst baronial castles were used by the Norman lords <b>to</b> <b>control</b> their widespread estates; a feudal system called the castle-guard was sometimes used to provide garrisons. Castles and sieges continued to grow in military sophistication during the 12th century, and in the 13th century new defensive town walls were constructed across England.|$|E

5|$|At 10:29, Captain Aoki {{ordered the}} ship's {{magazines}} flooded. The forward magazines were promptly flooded, but the aft magazines were {{not due to}} valve damage, likely caused by the near miss aft. The ship's main water pump also {{appears to have been}} damaged, greatly hindering fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 10:32 damage control teams attempted <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the spreading fires by employing the one-shot CO2 fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning aviation fuel proved impossible <b>to</b> <b>control,</b> and serious fires began to advance deeper into the interior of the ship. At 10:40, additional damage caused by the near-miss aft made itself known when the ship's rudder jammed 30 degrees to starboard during an evasive maneuver.|$|E
5|$|Beetles can be {{beneficial}} to human economics by controlling the populations of pests. The larvae and adults of some species of lady beetles (Coccinellidae) feed on aphids that are pests. Other lady beetles feed on scale insects, whitefly and mealybugs. If normal food sources are scarce, they may feed on small caterpillars, young plant bugs, or honeydew and nectar. Ground beetles (Carabidae) are common predators of many insect pests, including fly eggs, caterpillars, and wireworms. Ground beetles can help <b>to</b> <b>control</b> weeds by eating their seeds in the soil, reducing the need for herbicides to protect crops. The effectiveness of some species in reducing certain plant populations {{has resulted in the}} deliberate introduction of beetles in order <b>to</b> <b>control</b> weeds. For example, the genus Zygogramma is native to North America but has been used <b>to</b> <b>control</b> Parthenium hysterophorus in India and Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Russia.|$|E
40|$|Abnormal cytoplasmic pH {{regulation}} during activation in uremic neutrophils. Neutrophils {{isolated from}} ESRF patients demonstrated abnormal cytoplasmic pH changes after FMLP stimulation; the initial cytoplasmic acidification was absent (P < 0. 001 compared <b>to</b> <b>controls)</b> {{and the degree}} of alkalinization enhanced (P < 0. 05 compared <b>to</b> <b>controls).</b> This effect was not due to the absence of any of the factors associated with acidification in normal PMN since superoxide production was enhanced (P < 0. 05 compared <b>to</b> <b>controls)</b> and intracellular calcium release was normal. Our observations are not explicable by alterations in the function of the Na:H antiport since the kinetics of antiport activation by cytoplasmic pH were not different in uremic and control cells. Other factors must therefore be important in generating the abnormal pH response to chemotactic factors in uremic PMN. Cells from CAPD patients had some degree of initial acidification (P < 0. 001 compared <b>to</b> <b>controls</b> and P < 0. 05 compared to ESRF) and enhanced alkalinization (P < 0. 05 compared <b>to</b> <b>controls).</b> Preincubation of normal PMN in four-hour dwell PDE reproduced the responses of uremic PMN with absent acidification, enhanced alkalinization and enhanced superoxide generation after FMLP stimulation (P < 0. 05 compared <b>to</b> <b>controls).</b> Changes in the control of cytoplasmic pH in stimulated PMN may influence PMN function, and our observations may be relevant to the susceptibility of uremic patients to infection...|$|R

5|$|Before the Romans {{arrived in}} Britain, the land now forming {{the county of}} Carmarthenshire {{was part of the}} kingdom of the Demetae who gave their name to the county of Dyfed; it {{contained}} one of their chief settlements, Moridunum, now known as Carmarthen. The Romans established two forts in South Wales, one at Caerwent <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the southeast of the country, and one at Carmarthen <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the southwest. The fort at Carmarthen dates from around 75 AD, and there is a Roman amphitheatre nearby, so this probably makes Carmarthen the oldest continually occupied town in Wales.|$|E

5|$|Biological {{control is}} first {{recorded}} around 300 AD in China, when colonies of weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina, were intentionally placed in citrus plantations <b>to</b> <b>control</b> beetles and caterpillars. Also in China, ducks {{were used in}} paddy fields to consume pests, as illustrated in ancient cave art. In 1762, an Indian mynah was brought to Mauritius <b>to</b> <b>control</b> locusts, and about the same time, citrus trees in Burma were connected by bamboos to allow ants to pass between them and help control caterpillars. In the 1880s, ladybirds were used in citrus plantations in California <b>to</b> <b>control</b> scale insects, and other biological control experiments followed. The introduction of DDT, a cheap and effective compound, put an effective stop to biological control experiments. By the 1960s, problems of resistance to chemicals and damage to the environment began to emerge, and biological control had a renaissance. Chemical pest control is still the predominant type of pest control today, although {{a renewed interest in}} traditional and biological pest control developed {{towards the end of the}} 20th century and continues to this day.|$|E

David I invited Anglo-Norman lords into Scotland in the early 12th century to help him colonise and control areas of his kingdom such as Galloway; the new lords brought castle technologies with them and wooden castles began to be established over the south of the kingdom. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 1170s, under Henry II, castles were established there too.|$|E
