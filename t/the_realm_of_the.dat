5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that several imitation medallions and bracteates of the Migration Period (ca. first centuries AD) feature depictions of Hel. In particular the bracteates IK 14 and IK 124 depict a rider traveling down a slope and coming upon a female being holding a scepter or a staff. The downward slope may indicate that the rider is traveling towards <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead and the woman with the scepter may be a female ruler of that realm, corresponding to Hel.|$|E
5|$|The Eye's {{importance}} {{extends to}} the afterlife as well. Egyptian funerary texts associate deceased souls with Ra in his nightly travels through the Duat, <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead, and with his rebirth at dawn. In these texts the Eye and its various manifestations often appear, protecting and giving birth to the deceased as they do for Ra. A spell in the Coffin Texts states that Bastet, as the Eye, illuminates the Duat like a torch, allowing the deceased to pass safely through its depths.|$|E
5|$|There is no creator God, {{according}} to Mahavira's teachings, and existence has neither beginning nor end. However, there are gods and demons in Jain beliefs, whose jivas {{are a part}} of the same cycles of births and deaths depending on the accumulated karmic particles. The goal of spiritual practice is to liberate the jiva from all karmic accumulation, and thus enter <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> siddhas who are never reborn again. Enlightenment, to Mahavira, is the consequence of a process of self-cultivation and self-restraint.|$|E

5|$|Hindu scriptures provide diverse {{accounts}} {{of the birth of}} Kamadhenu.

Still other scriptures narrate that Kamadhenu was in the possession of either Jamadagni or Vashista (both ancient sages), and that kings who tried to steal her from the sage ultimately faced dire consequences for their actions. Kamadhenu plays the important role of providing milk and milk products to be used in her sage-master's oblations; she is also capable of producing fierce warriors to protect him. In addition to dwelling in the sage's hermitage, she is also described as dwelling in Goloka - <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cows - and Patala, the netherworld.|$|E

5|$|Since ancient times, the Chinese {{believed}} in a folk religion and Taoism that incorporated many deities. The Chinese believed Tao and the afterlife was a reality {{parallel to the}} living world, complete with its own bureaucracy and afterlife currency needed by dead ancestors. Funerary practices included providing the deceased with everything they might need in the afterlife, including animals, servants, entertainers, hunters, homes, and officials. This ideal is reflected in Tang dynasty art.

5|$|Comets {{are thought}} to have two {{separate}} points of origin in the Solar System. Short-period comets (those with orbits of up to 200years) are generally accepted to have emerged from either the Kuiper belt or the scattered disc, which are two linked flat discs of icy debris beyond Neptune's orbit at 30AU and jointly extending out beyond 100AU from the Sun. Long-period comets, such as comet Hale–Bopp, whose orbits last for thousands of years, {{are thought to}} originate in the Oort cloud. The orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, and so very few comets are thought to originate there. The scattered disc, however, is dynamically active, and is far more likely to be the place of origin for comets. Comets pass from the scattered disc into <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer planets, becoming what are known as centaurs. These centaurs are then sent farther inward to become the short-period comets.|$|E
5|$|From {{at least}} {{the time of the}} Pyramid Texts, kings hoped that after their deaths they could emulate Osiris's {{restoration}} to life and his rule over <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead. By the early Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE), non-royal Egyptians believed that they, too, could overcome death as Osiris had, by worshipping him and receiving the funerary rites that were partly based on his myth. Osiris thus became Egypt's most important afterlife deity. The myth also influenced the notion, which grew prominent in the New Kingdom, that only virtuous people could reach the afterlife. As the assembled deities judged Osiris and Horus to be in the right, undoing the injustice of Osiris's death, so a deceased soul had to be judged righteous in order for his or her death to be undone. As ruler of the land of the dead and as a god connected with maat, Osiris became the judge in this posthumous trial, offering life after death to those who followed his example. New Kingdom funerary texts such as the Amduat and the Book of Gates liken Ra himself to a deceased soul. In them, he travels through the Duat and unites with Osiris to be reborn at dawn. Thus, Osiris was not only believed to enable rebirth for the dead; he renewed the sun, the source of life and maat, and thus renewed the world itself.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} of atomic bombs lay outside <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ministry of Defence.

Tizard became the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence in November 1946, and in January 1947 he also became the chairman of the Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC), which was established to advise the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff on matters of scientific policy. Tizard attempted to gain some control over nuclear weapons policy. Anderson's advisory committee was abolished at the end of 1947, and two new committees were established in its place, the Atomic Energy (Defence Research) Committee AE(DR), which came under the DRPC, and was chaired by Tizard; and the Atomic Energy (Review of Production) Committee, which was answerable to Portal. But Tizard failed to gain control of atomic energy policy.|$|E
5|$|Some {{practitioners}} do not emphasize {{belief in}} an afterlife, instead stressing {{the importance of}} behaviour and reputation in this world. In Icelandic Heathenry, there is no singular dogmatic belief about the afterlife. A common Heathen belief is that a human being has multiple souls, which are separate yet linked together. It is common to find a belief in four or five souls, two of which survive bodily death: one of these, the hugr, travels to <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancestors, while the other, the fetch, undergoes a process of reincarnation into a new body. In Heathen belief, there are various realms that the hugr can enter, {{based in part on}} the worth of the individual's earthly life; these include the hall of Valhalla, ruled over by Odin, or Sessrúmnir, the hall of Freyja. Beliefs regarding reincarnation vary widely among Heathens, although one common belief is that individuals are reborn within their family or clan.|$|E

5|$|Although Kennedy Martin's notion for {{the serial}} was {{influenced}} by real political events, he had {{for a long time}} railed against naturalism in television drama – most notably in a 1964 article for the theatre magazine Encore, titled “Nats Go Home. First Statement of a New Drama for Television”, in which he sought “to free the camera from photographing dialogue, to free the structure from natural time and to exploit the total and absolute objectivity of the television camera”. Edge of Darkness producer Michael Wearing has noted that “there is a mystical dimension to Troy's imagination. His instincts are visual and non-naturalistic”. Kennedy Martin, therefore, crafted a serial that on the one hand placed its events squarely within the real, present day world but on the other also placed itself within <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mystical and the mythic. Realism and authenticity was provided by the appearances of real life television presenter Sue Cook and Labour MP Michael Meacher. There was also use of contemporary stock footage, such as Robin Day's interview with Margaret Thatcher and references to real persons like Michael Heseltine and places such as Sellafield, alongside the references to fictitious characters and places contained in the plot. The mystical dimension is provided by Emma's ghost while the mythic is provided by Craven himself and by Jedburgh and Grogan. Kennedy Martin, influenced by John Darragh's The Real Camelot (Thames and Hudson, 1981) which examined the pagan origins of the Arthurian legend, saw Craven as a modern-day Green Man who would confront the threats to the Earth on behalf of Gaia. Jedburgh was conceived by Kennedy Martin as a Knight of the Marches, one of the Teutonic Knights who defended the borders of Eastern Europe, opposed to Grogan, who Kennedy Martin saw as a descendant of the Knights Templar who, according to legend, had guarded a special wisdom in the Temple of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. These aspects would reach their apotheosis in the serial's conclusion in which Kennedy Martin envisaged that Craven, having found the plutonium stolen by Jedburgh, would be shot by a sniper and would be transformed into a tree.|$|E
