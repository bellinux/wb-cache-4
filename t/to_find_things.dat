25|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} P. R. Brown, and released on November 7, 2016. The video reflects the song's central theme of being in unsettled situations and getting through them. In {{the beginning of the}} video, Armstrong is shown as a solitary figure; his bandmates Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool are sitting lethargically in a different location. The video explores situations of various other characters as well, all starting out in a dejected state. The shots of Armstrong, Dirnt, and Cool are repeatedly seen interspersed with developments {{in the lives of the}} other characters. Eventually, all of them manage <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>things</b> that make them happy. As the video reaches its end, Armstrong is seen entering a warehouse and being happily reunited with his bandmates, who had begun to play their instruments.|$|E
500|$|Gatiss has criticised recent {{television}} {{adaptations of}} the Conan Doyle stories as [...] "too reverential and too slow", aiming instead {{to be as}} irreverent to the canon as the 1930s and 1940s films starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, which were mostly set in the then contemporary interwar era. Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock uses modern technology, such as texting, the internet and GPS to solve crimes. Paul McGuigan, who directed two episodes of Sherlock, says that this {{is in keeping with}} Conan Doyle's character, pointing out that [...] "n the books he would use any device possible and he was always in the lab doing experiments. It's just a modern day version of it. He will use the tools that are available to him today in order <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>things</b> out." ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron sketched Jack's nude {{portrait}} of Rose for a scene which he feels has {{the backdrop of}} repression. [...] "You {{know what it means}} for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason," [...] he said. The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. [...] "It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them," [...] Cameron stated. [...] "They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot." [...] Cameron said he and his crew [...] "were just trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>things</b> to shoot" [...] because the big set [...] "wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot." [...] After seeing the scene on film, Cameron felt it worked out considerably well.|$|E

They are both {{surprised}} by Roy's beautiful home and the elegant wedding details, and Roy tells them he runs a very successful gravel company. During his wedding toast, Roy stuns his lovely bride by performing [...] "She's Got a Way" [...] by Billy Joel on the piano, saying that {{he told her he}} was taking boxing lessons as a cover for learning some music for her instead. Pam and Jim, convinced they already know everything about one another but stunned by Roy's transformation, try <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>things</b> about themselves the other does not know. This is exacerbated by Jim's frequent calls about a new business he is starting with a friend, because Jim and Pam agreed that the venture was not right for them, but Jim then signed onto it without telling his wife he had done so. Pam tries unsuccessfully to bait Jim {{to find out what the}} secret is and becomes increasingly annoyed that her husband is lying to her.|$|E
500|$|A {{lot of my}} {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, so we thought 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>things</b> that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} with previous Ace Attorney games, players could identify with Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice; for Ace Attorney Investigations, they wanted players to be {{immersed in the}} game and feel like they are Edgeworth. He said that they think players will feel a connection with Edgeworth and understand his character. As examples of this, Eshiro cited the ability to directly control Edgeworth, and the possibility to see inside his head: the game's logic system was created because the development team wanted to show how Edgeworth thinks. It represents what is happening inside his mind, which Eshiro describes as a [...] "very cool, calm and collected way of thinking". For the rebuttal phases in the game, Eshiro wanted to try out new things that could not be done in courtroom battles: during rebuttals, several characters come in and out during each scene at a rapid pace, providing the player with evidence, to create drama with tension. Ace Attorney Investigations has a larger focus on the environment than previous Ace Attorney titles had; previous titles featured gameplay elements in which the player finds contradictions in suspects' statements, whereas the goal of Ace Attorney Investigations is <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>things</b> at the crime scene that contradict the evidence the player has. The game's third person perspective was specifically chosen to be different from the main series' first person perspective, and to show the environment so that players can walk around inside it. The game system was designed specifically for Ace Attorney Investigations, with the aim of being different from the main series; therefore, Eshiro felt that a lot of its features should stay within the Investigations series, and not be used in other Ace Attorney titles.|$|E

2500|$|Landschulheim Herrlingen was non-denominational, {{accepting}} {{children from}} any faith, and coeducational. Having {{been influenced by}} progressive education in the United States, Essinger ran the school accordingly. The primary grades were taught using the Montessori method. Teachers were {{to set an example}} in [...] "learning, laughing, loving and living" [...] and the motto for the school was [...] "Boys and girls learn to be inquisitive, curious and independent and <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>things</b> out themselves. All work is to encourage critical thinking." [...] Individual work was encouraged. There was no testing of skills or attainment. Instead, grading was replaced by an assessment that described the development of the individual child and progress was discussed with the children. Parents received the assessment of their children in writing.|$|E
2500|$|In fall 2000, Norwood {{finally began}} conceiving ideas {{for a third}} studio album with the Atlantic label. While Rodney Jerkins, the main {{producer}} of her previous album, and his Darkchild crew, including Fred Jerkins III and LaShawn Daniels, {{had been working on}} several new songs for the singer's upcoming project in hopes of recreating the winning chemistry of Never Say Never, [...] Norwood {{wanted to make sure that}} she was gaining more creative control over the project and thus, arranged meetings with all her writers and musicians to discuss the lyricals topics and sounds she wanted for the album. [...] "I was involved from A-Z," [...] she said. [...] "Every song on the album was inspired by my life [...] I wanted to talk about how I feel on so many levels. I wanted to be in touch with all of my emotions and share them. I've taken three years off for myself and got a chance <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>things</b> I like to do, things I don't like and things I want to change about myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although reviewers {{have read}} {{political}} intonations into the album's ostensible themes, deeming it “unashamedly prog in its ambition and dimensions”, Turner {{is reluctant to}} admit to such an agenda. [...] "I'd hesitate to call the record 'political' because Isis has never taken a public political stand on anything. At the same time, it's intended to draw a parallel between the system that Bentham created and what's {{going on in the}} world right now". Likewise, he notes that the album is “absolutely not about a political agenda. I always try to write about stuff that is specific to my life during the time I write an album. And I try <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>things</b> that I'm emotionally and intellectually attached to. We've never been a political band. But right now politics are such a great importance. You can travel everywhere and you simply cannot ignore them. And so this is one of the main things that have been occupying my mind during the creation of this record. So beyond these things just being interesting themselves they have a lot of relevance to what's {{going on in the world}} right now [...] I think these things are relevant to everybody's lives and specifically to me and this band and what we experienced through living in this country over the last couple of years. And also I think my lyrics are so abstract and fragmented sometimes that I feel like those things are a better representation of what I'm writing about than printed lyrics might be.” Despite his denial that Panopticon is politically motivated, Turner does refer to the then-incumbent George W. Bush administration's tenure as a source of inspiration; about how Bentham's essay bore relevance to “hit home in terms of how [...] is treating its own citizens outside and within the country.” ...|$|E
