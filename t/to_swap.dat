5|$|Goodison Park hosted {{five games}} during the 1966 FIFA World Cup. The {{original}} schedule of the 1966 World Cup meant that if England won their group and then reached the Semi final, the match {{would be held}} at Goodison Park. However, the organising committee were allowed <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> the venues, with England playing Portugal at Wembley Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Charles Ebbets, {{owner of}} the Brooklyn Dodgers, viewed Tinker as a good {{replacement}} for the released Bob Fisher, their shortstop in 1913. The Cubs, Giants, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Philadelphia Phillies were also interested in acquiring Tinker. Ebbets secured Tinker's release from the Reds for $15,000, with another $10,000 {{to be paid to}} Tinker. The teams also agreed <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> players, with Earl Yingling and Herbie Moran going to Cincinnati and Dick Egan joining Brooklyn. Ebbets entered contract negotiations with Tinker.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar {{was part}} of a 17-ship squadron, keeping four French ships-of-the-line in Fort Royal, Martinique, when on 29April 1781 a 20-ship fleet and a {{merchant}} convoy under Contre-amiral François deGrasse arrived from Brest. Out of sight of the British, deGrasse put a man ashore <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> information with Fort Royal's garrison, and agree on a plan of attack with the blockaded ships.|$|E
5000|$|Unix systems, {{and other}} Unix-like {{operating}} systems, {{use the term}} [...] "swap" [...] to describe both the act of moving memory pages between RAM and disk, and the region of a disk the pages are stored on. In some of those systems, {{it is common to}} dedicate an entire partition of a hard disk <b>to</b> <b>swapping.</b> These partitions are called swap partitions. Many systems have an entire hard drive dedicated <b>to</b> <b>swapping,</b> separate from the data drive(s), containing only a swap partition. A hard drive dedicated <b>to</b> <b>swapping</b> is called a [...] "swap drive" [...] or a [...] "scratch drive" [...] or a [...] "scratch disk". Some of those systems only support <b>swapping</b> <b>to</b> a <b>swap</b> partition; others also support <b>swapping</b> <b>to</b> files.|$|R

Cuomo stated that, while the band liked the chosen band photo for the cover, Matt Sharp was {{not happy with the}} way his head looked. The Geffen Art Director used Photoshop <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> out the head with one from another shot.|$|E
5|$|Janus and Epimetheus {{are called}} co-orbital moons. They are of roughly equal size, with Janus being {{slightly}} larger than Epimetheus. Janus and Epimetheus have orbits {{with only a few}} kilometers difference in semi-major axis, close enough that they would collide if they attempted to pass each other. Instead of colliding, however, their gravitational interaction causes them <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> orbits every four years.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea centre back Frank Sinclair {{and left}} back Graeme Le Saux were both sidelined {{for the final}} due to their calf injuries, causing player-manager Vialli <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> them with Michael Duberry, and Danny Granville, who had {{recovered}} from an abscess pain. Central midfielder Poyet was {{also included in the}} starting line-up to join captain Dennis Wise, after returning from a damaged cruciate ligament. Together with forward and lead goalscorer Vialli, Flo began in the attack, instead of Zola, who was named as a substitute, despite making an improvement from his damaged groin, sustained in a league fixture against Liverpool in April.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>swapping</b> semi-major axes like Saturn's moons Epimetheus and Janus, {{another possibility}} is to share the same axis, but swap eccentricities instead.|$|R
50|$|When byte <b>swapping</b> is {{required}} <b>to</b> convert between the big-endian byte order of variant 1 and the little-endian byte order of variant 2, the fields above define the swapping. The first three fields are unsigned 32- and 16-bit integers and are subject <b>to</b> <b>swapping,</b> while {{the last two}} fields consist of uninterpreted bytes, not subject <b>to</b> <b>swapping.</b> This byte swapping applies even for version 3, 4, and 5 UUID's where the canonical fields do not correspond {{to the content of}} the UUID.|$|R
5000|$|The third {{category}} related <b>to</b> <b>swaps</b> also entered into {{in connection with}} an existing loan, where the local authority sought <b>to</b> use <b>swaps</b> <b>to</b> alter {{the proportion of the}} interest which was paid on either a fixed or variable basis through swap contracts. In the judgment these were referred to as [...] "re-profiling". Similarly, Lord Templeman determined fairly immediately in his judgment that these were in his view largely indistinguishable from parallel contracts.|$|R
5|$|Electrons are {{identical}} particles because they cannot {{be distinguished from}} each other by their intrinsic physical properties. In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting electrons must be able <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> positions without an observable change {{to the state of}} the system. The wave function of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped; that is, , where the variables r1 and r2 correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively. Since the absolute value is not changed by a sign swap, this corresponds to equal probabilities. Bosons, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions instead.|$|E
5|$|Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes is {{the third}} entry in the Marvel vs. Capcom series of 2D {{fighting}} games. The game utilizes similar tag team-based game mechanics to its predecessor, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter. Before starting each match, the player selects a team of two fighters to compete in one-on-one combat. The player is free <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> between their characters at any point during battle. While one character fights, their teammate resting off-screen slowly regenerates their life gauge. The first team to exhaust their opponent's vitality wins the match; however, if the timer runs out before either team is knocked out, the player with the most remaining health is declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, 2014, the Rockets {{acquired}} Jason Terry, a 2015 second-round pick, and Portland's 2016 second-round {{pick from}} Sacramento {{in exchange for}} Alonzo Gee, Scotty Hopson, and a trade exception. Previously, on July 10, 2013, the Kings acquired a 2016 second round pick (with an option <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> selections with New Orleans) and a 2018 second round pick from Portland in a three-team trade with New Orleans Pelicans. Previously, on July 15, 2012, the Knicks acquired Raymond Felton and Kurt Thomas from the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Jared Jeffries, the rights to Dan Gadzuric, the future selections of Kostas Papanikolaou and Georgios Printezis, and their 2016 second round selection.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after making}} {{the choice to}} include {{electronic}} drums and triggers, Peart added what has become another trademark of his kit: a rotating drum riser. During live Rush shows the riser allows Peart <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> the prominent portions of the kit (traditional acoustic in front, electronic in back). A staple of Peart's live drum solos has been the in-performance rotation-and-swap of {{the front and back}} kits as part of the solo itself. This special effect provides both a symbolic transition of drum styles within the solo and a visual treat for the audience.|$|E
5|$|Australia and England {{reassembled}} at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Following his unbeaten 159 in {{the previous}} match and Brown's struggles when playing in the middle-order, Loxton took Brown's position. Brown had scored 25, 26, 17, 24 and 32 in the middle-order in the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and the first two Tests. As fast bowling all rounder Keith Miller had been struggling with a back injury that prevented him from bowling from time to time, Loxton {{was seen as a}} necessary reinforcement for the frontline bowlers. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, and Loxton bowled first change, sending down seven overs for the loss of 18 runs. The Australians themselves opened with Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston taking the new ball, but Bradman had misjudged the breeze and needed <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> his bowlers' ends. For this purpose, Loxton bowled a solitary over, his first in Ashes cricket. He was erratic in his length and bowled three long hops outside leg stump at the debutant George Emmett, who ignored the opportunity to attack and let the balls pass.|$|E
5|$|By July 1, 1919, {{the first}} roads {{to carry the}} M-64 {{designation}} were signed in the southern Lower Peninsula. This highway ran from the Ohio state line north to Hillsdale, ending in rural southeastern Calhoun County. This trunkline was extended northerly in 1926 through Homer to end at the contemporary US12 in Albion. In {{the latter half of}} 1929, this highway was redesignated M-9 (now M-99). At the same time, the original M-9 in Keweenaw County between US41 and Eagle Harbor was renumbered M-64. The net effect was <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> the numbers between roads on opposing ends of the state. The next year, the M-64 number was swapped with another highway, the original M-129 that ran along the west side of Lake Gogebic and south to the Wisconsin state line.|$|E

5|$|On 15 September 1914 Rowell and {{his classmates}} were {{commissioned}} as first lieutenants in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). At the time, Rowell's class {{had not yet}} completed its military training. The AIF's commander, Major General William Throsby Bridges, decided that regimental duty would rectify that deficiency, so he allotted the Duntroon cadets as regimental officers of the AIF, rather than as staff officers. The cost of this decision was high; of the 134 commissioned in time to serve at the front, 42 were killed and 38 wounded. Cadets were posted to units being formed in their home states, so Rowell was posted to the 10th Infantry Battalion. When he discovered that the 3rd Light Horse Regiment was {{to be commanded by}} his cousin, Lieutenant Colonel F. M. Rowell, Sydney obtained permission <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> places with another member of his Duntroon class Lieutenant Eric Wilkes Talbot Smith. It was a fateful decision; Smith was fatally wounded on Anzac Day.|$|E
5|$|On July 10, 2015, Stauskas {{was traded}} to the Philadelphia 76ers along with Carl Landry, Jason Thompson, a future first round pick, and the rights <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> first round picks in 2016 and 2017, in {{exchange}} for the rights to Artūras Gudaitis and Luka Mitrović. During the preseason, Stauskas was impaired by a right tibia stress reaction. Although he felt recovered from the stress reaction {{by the beginning of the}} season, he missed the October 28 season opener with back spasms. The 2015–16 76ers team played no players over the age of 24 or with more than 3 years of NBA experience on opening night. Stauskas joined the young team's rotation in October 30 against the Utah Jazz with a 12-point debut performance. Stauskas moved into the starting lineup on November 2 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. He posted a career-high tying 15 points against his idol LeBron James. On November 7, Stauskas posted a career-high 18 points and career-high tying five assists against the Orlando Magic. He tallied at least 12 points in each of his first five games of action for Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the filming}} was completed, more than 20 two-hour Beta SP video tapes of footage {{had to be}} edited down to fit {{the actions of the}} game. The {{programming}} included editing the original video footage, and mixing the rendered images of doors, drawers, chairs and other objects into the footage frame-by-frame, which was necessary for more than 100 scenes. The game required more polishing and fine-tuning than most games of its time due to the many video components, and the programmers had to determine the desired frame rate, data transfer rate and desired resolution of the video elements. Another challenge for the game was CD resource management. Since many of the scenes in the game could be repeated in multiple chapters, some pieces of the code were written onto several different CDs {{to reduce the number of}} times the player had <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> discs in the middle of a chapter, an unusual practice for computer games at the time. The final game was on seven discs, a large number for a computer game, and more than the four or five discs originally expected.|$|E

5|$|Organised league {{football}} {{had been}} {{played in the}} West Riding of Yorkshire since 1894 in the West Yorkshire League, but no side from the county had played in the Football League. So on 30 January 1903, Scotsman James Whyte, a sub-editor of the Bradford Observer, met with Football Association representative John Brunt at Valley Parade, {{the home of the}} city's rugby league side Manningham Football Club, to discuss establishing a Football League club within Bradford. In May, Manningham's committee decided <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> codes from rugby to association football and so the Football League decided to invite Bradford City to join their league in a bid to introduce association football to the West Riding, the main sport in which was rugby league. The League voted in favour of replacing Doncaster Rovers, who had finished the 1902–03 season in 16th position in the Second Division, with Bradford City even though Bradford had yet to play a single game.|$|E
5|$|Shiren the Wanderer is a roguelike game {{in which}} the player {{traverses}} thirty randomly generated grid-based, top-down areas – referred to as floors – in which they fight enemies and find items. The player can move in eight directions, attack with melee weapons and arrows, and use {{a wide range of}} items with different effects: for example, some heal the player, some fling away enemies, and some allow the player <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> positions with an enemy. The items are kept in the player's inventory, which only has a limited amount of space. For every step the player takes, their health regenerates, but their fullness counter also decreases; because of this, the player needs to carry food items with them, which also take up inventory space. The gameplay is turn-based: every time the player performs an action, such as moving, attacking, or using items, all enemies and characters in the area perform one action as well. In addition to the enemy characters, there are friendly characters, three of which can join the player's party and help them with things such as healing.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} England's opening pair {{did not result}} in an {{improvement}} on the scoreboard. A run out was narrowly avoided following a mix-up on the first ball, and Cyril Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that offered early assistance to the bowlers. The Australians themselves started with Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston taking the new ball, but Bradman had misjudged the breeze and had <b>to</b> <b>swap</b> his bowlers' ends. For this purpose, Loxton bowled a solitary over. He was erratic in his length and bowled three long hops outside leg stump at the debutant Emmett, who ignored the opportunity to attack and let the balls pass. At the other end, Washbrook also played watchfully and avoided any horizontal bat shots, apart from a missed cut against Johnston's bowling. Overall however, the English openers appeared comfortable in the first half hour of play.|$|E
