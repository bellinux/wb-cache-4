500|$|... "Luxurious" [...] is an R ballad, whose {{instrumentation}} {{consists of}} keyboards and synthesizers. It {{is written in}} common time in the key of A minor. The song uses a descending i-vii-VI-V chord progression. The lyrics of the song include descriptions of wealth and riches, what one reviewer called [...] "a world of Egyptian cotton, cashmere, tuberoses, and, of course, diamonds". Stefani stated that [...] " [...] song really is more about a love relationship. If you really listen to the lyrics, it has nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>money</b> or luxury. It {{has to do with}} love, being rich in love. I just wanted to think of a clever way to express how you have to work really hard for the rewards of that." [...] The single version of the song contains an additional verse from rapper Slim Thug for release to urban radio and clubs.|$|E
500|$|Despite his folkloric qualities, the Slender Man {{is not in}} {{the public}} domain. Several for-profit ventures {{involving}} the Slender Man have unequivocally acknowledged Knudsen as the creator of this fictional character, while others were civilly blocked from distribution (including the Kickstarter-funded film) after legal complaints from Knudsen and other sources. Though Knudsen himself has given his personal blessing to a number of Slender Man-related projects, the issue is complicated by the fact that, while he is the character's creator, a third party holds the options to any adaptations into other media, including film and television. The identity of this option holder has not been made public. Knudsen himself has argued that his enforcement of copyright has less <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>money</b> than with artistic integrity: [...] "I just want something amazing to come off it... something that's scary and disturbing and kinda different. I would hate for something to come out and just be kinda conventional." [...] As of May 2016, the media rights to Slender Man have been sold to production company Mythology Entertainment.|$|E

500|$|The {{protagonist of}} the prior film, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), was killed {{off-screen}} in the film. Rumors indicated that Sawa had a contract dispute with New Line concerning the deduction of his salary; however, Perry resolved {{the issue with}} the statement that [...] "it had everything to do with narrative, and nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>money</b> or Devon’s unwillingness to come back." [...] Despite this, New Line reinstated Ali Larter to reprise her character as Clear Rivers. [...] "When New Line asked me to come back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script and let me have some input, and it was really terrific," [...] Larter revealed. Larter indicated that Clear [...] " [...] gotten to a hardened place and tucked herself inside because she has felt so much pain in her life. By having herself committed to a mental hospital, she has created a safehouse so that Death can't get her." [...] Tony Todd also resumed his character as mortician William Bludworth. [...] "It’s the same character that we saw before that the audience loved," [...] Ellis expressed.|$|E
500|$|People {{are always}} {{using the word}} Illuminati but they're always {{referencing}} it in an incorrect way. People often accuse me of {{being a member of}} the Illuminati and I think in today's pop culture the Illuminati is perceived as a group of powerful, successful people who are working behind the scenes to control the universe. Not people with consciousness, not people who are enlightened. So people were accusing me of {{being a member of the}} Illuminati, and I kept going, wait—so first I had to figure out what that meant...I know who the real Illuminati are, and I know where that word comes from. The real Illuminati were a group of scientists, artists, philosophers, writers, who came about in what is referred to as the Age of Enlightenment, after the Dark Ages, when there was no writing and no art and no creativity and no spirituality, and life was really at a standstill. And right after that, everything flourished. So we had people like Shakespeare and Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo and Isaac Newton, and all these great minds and great thinkers, and they were called Illuminati...It had nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>money</b> and power. Of course they were powerful, because they influenced people. But their goal was to inspire and enlighten. So when people refer to me as a member of the Illuminati, I always want to say thank you. Thank you for putting me in that category.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2000 Presidential election, Lee Alcorn, {{president}} of the Dallas NAACP branch, criticized Al Gore's selection of Senator Joe Lieberman for his Vice-Presidential candidate because Lieberman was Jewish. On a gospel talk radio show on station KHVN, Alcorn stated, [...] "If we get a Jew person, then what I'm wondering is, I mean, what is this movement for, you know? Does it {{have anything to do}} with the failed peace talks?" [...] … [...] "So I think we need to be very suspicious of any kind of partnerships between the Jews at that kind of level because we know that their interest primarily has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>money</b> and these kind of things." ...|$|E

60|$|Arthur did so, and {{presently}} Philip, in {{that tone}} of gentlemanly ease which above everything distinguished {{him from his}} cousin, led the conversation round to his guest's prospects and affairs, more especially his money affairs. Arthur answered him frankly enough, but this money talk had not the same charms for him that it had for his host. Indeed, a marked repugnance to everything that had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>money</b> {{was one of his}} characteristics; and, wearied out at length with pecuniary details and endless researches into the mysteries of investment, he took advantage of a pause to attempt to change the subject.|$|E

All this sort of rot is likely to frighten them, and we can't afford to frighten them. The passengers aboard an Ocean steamer don't feel reassured when the ship's way is stopped, and they hear the workmen's hammers tinkering at the engines down below.

There {{is nothing}} {{the matter with}} her physically, but she is very rich, and is prudent and careful about {{everything}} that belongs to her, while her husband is not a business man at all and never has anything <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>money</b> matters of importance. There are three children, and she has reason to feel anxious about them should they and their property {{be left in the}} charge of Mr. Clinton, or to the tender mercies of some woman who would marry him {{for the sake of his}} wealth. You can see for yourself that it is no wonder she casts her eyes upon Margaret. I believe Mrs. Clinton could die happy if she could see her husband and Margaret Temple promise themselves to each other at her bedside.' ...|$|E

5000|$|As {{the play}} {{progresses}} {{the reader is}} faced therefore with the suspense of the outcome: which is either to agree with Sheppey’s view as <b>to</b> what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the <b>money</b> or agree <b>with</b> those that think his proposed actions are [...] "potty".|$|R
6000|$|There was a laugh {{among the}} group. 'A good many I should fancy, Jacob, but I don't think this chap {{could have been}} one of them. A man who has been left in the lurch {{generally}} takes it out in strong language. If this chap had wanted you for a tenner and you had not forked over, he would probably have spoken of you as a swindling scoundrel and said that if he met you he would take it out of you in another way if he could not get the money. Now he didn't seem put out at all; he wanted to see you about something or other, but I don't think it was anything <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>money.</b> I can always tell when there is anything wrong about that. A man may put it as mild as he likes, but there is something in it that says he is nasty.' ...|$|E
60|$|When he got {{beyond the}} light {{he turned and}} went back to a {{position}} where in the dark he could watch without being seen. His father and the hotel proprietor were again engaged in earnest colloquy. Neuman had disappeared. Kurt saw the huge shadow of a man pass across a drawn blind in a room up-stairs. Then he saw smaller shadows, and arms raised in vehement gesticulation. The very shadows were sinister. Men passed {{in and out of the}} hotel. Once old Dorn came to the door and peered all around. Kurt observed that there was a dark side entrance to this hotel. Presently Neuman returned to the desk and said something to old Dorn, who shook his head emphatically, and then threw himself into a chair, in a brooding posture that Kurt knew well. He had seen it so often that he knew it had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>money.</b> His father was refusing demands of some kind. Neuman again left the office, this time with the proprietor. They were absent some little time.|$|E
60|$|The {{business}} {{which had}} called him out from his seclusion in his lost corner of the Eastern seas was with the Tesmans, and it had something <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>money.</b> He transacted it quickly, and then found himself {{with nothing to do}} while he awaited Davidson, who was to take him back to his solitude; for back to his solitude Heyst meant to go. He whom we used to refer to as the Enchanted Heyst was suffering from thorough disenchantment. Not with the islands, however. The Archipelago has a lasting fascination. It is not easy to shake off the spell of island life. Heyst was disenchanted with life as a whole. His scornful temperament, beguiled into action, suffered from failure in a subtle way unknown to men accustomed to grapple with the realities of common human enterprise. It was like the gnawing pain of useless apostasy, a sort of shame before his own betrayed nature; and in addition, he also suffered from plain, downright remorse. He deemed himself guilty of Morrison's death. A rather absurd feeling, since no one could possibly have foreseen the horrors of the cold, wet summer lying in wait for poor Morrison at home.|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{he gives}} me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an' his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer. No, all he has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> his <b>money</b> is <b>to</b> guttle it. But I'll show him!" ...|$|R
60|$|So {{some people}} will say, and so some {{will be glad to}} say. But why? Because {{they do not want to}} be righteous, upright, just, and honest in their money dealings; and, therefore, they are glad to make out that they could not be upright if they tried; because money being a bad thing altogether, a man must needs, if he has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>money,</b> do things which he knows are wrong. I say some people are glad to believe that. I do not mean any one in this congregation. God forbid! I mean in the world in general. We do see people, {{religious}} people too, do things about money which they know are mean, covetous, cruel, and then excuse themselves by saying,--'Well, of course I would not do so to my own brother; but, in the way of business, one can't help doing these things.' Now, I do not quite believe them. I have seldom seen the man who cheated his neighbour, who would not cheat his own brother if he had a chance: but so they say. And, if they be religious people, they will quote Scripture, and say,--Ah! it is the fault of the unrighteous mammon; and, in dealing with the unrighteous mammon, we cannot help these little failings, and so forth: till they seem to have two quite different rules of right and wrong; one for the saving of their own souls, which they keep to when they are hearing sermons, and reading good books; and the other for money, which they keep to when they have to pay their debts or transact business.|$|E
