500|$|Following Jackson's death, {{reports of}} {{his use of}} {{pethidine}} (Demerol) surfaced. Cherilyn Lee, a nurse who provided nutritional counseling to Jackson, said that on April 12, 2009, he asked her for unspecified [...] "products for sleep." [...] On April 19, 2009, he told her the only medicine that would help was propofol. Lee refused, telling him, [...] "Michael, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> you taking this medication ... is you're {{going to take it}} and you're not going to wake up." [...] Jackson dismissed the warning, telling her he had been given the drug before by IV injection and that his doctor told him it was safe. He did not name the doctor. [...] An overdose of propofol can cause the patient to stop breathing, leading to a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the body which can lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.|$|E
500|$|Kid Klown in Krazy Chase {{received}} mixed reception. It {{holds an}} aggregate score of 64.17% on GameRankings based on three reviews. Author Andy Slaven wrote that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> {{the game was}} its [...] "strange" [...] three-quarter perspective. Nintendo Power gave it a 3.375 out of 5. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it a 7.6 out of 10, summarizing that [...] "this one {{requires a lot of}} skill and technique, but the various antics and animations (especially on Kidd's enemy) are incredibly lifelike and make this one of the better games around." [...] IGN called the Super NES version overlooked and described it as a [...] "zany" [...] game that [...] "boasts stellar colors and some really frantic animation". Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell described the video game J.J. & Jeff as a [...] "poor man's Plok/Kid Klown in Crazy Chase/Putty Quest/etc". Edge compared Let's Tap to Kid Klown due to the similar challenges found in Let's Taps multi-player mode. Nintendo Life's Andrew Donaldson commented that while not a bad game, there's no reason to play it {{due to a lack of}} levels and an abundance of games that do what it does better.|$|E

2500|$|To read Reston on Henry Kissinger today is, as it {{was during}} the Nixon administration, a little embarrassing. (Reston once titled one of his columns [...] "By Henry Kissinger with James Reston".) Nothing in his {{experience}} in Washington, Reston says over and over in these memoirs, [...] "was ever quite as good or as bad as the fashionable opinion of the day", and he thinks of Kissinger as a prime example of this. [...] But in praising Kissinger, Reston is praising a man who regularly misled him, who wiretapped NSC staff members to determine who was leaking to reporters when they revealed his unconstitutional maneuverings, and who urged Nixon to prosecute Reston's newspaper for its constitutionally protected publication of the Pentagon Papers. During the infamous 1972 Christmas bombing of North Vietnam, Reston wrote of Kissinger that [...] "he has said nothing in public about the bombing in North Vietnam, which he undoubtedly opposes.... If the bombing goes on ... Mr. Kissinger will be free to resign." [...] <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the interpretation, however, was that the bombings were Kissinger's idea. He misled Reston about his own position and then misled the White House staff about these conversations, finally admitting the truth when confronted with his phone records.|$|E

50|$|It's a {{few days}} before Christmas, and James (Robert Taylor) and Ellen (Cathy Lewis), married seven years and {{recently}} relocated to California for the husband's engineering job, move into a hastily finished rental house in a development that was started before the war. Dusty furniture and creaky hinges seem to be <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> place at first glance. But the very night they move in, the two hear inhuman cries in the night, and find blood oozing out from under a closet door they can't open. Next, Ellen, sleep-walking, attacks James like a crazed animal and bites him savagely, waking with no memory of the attack; then the milkman is discovered with his throat torn out. The narrative concludes with James' indication that he has accepted his fate and is no longer afraid; he knows now what he must do. Just then there's {{a knock on the door}} and the inhuman scream is heard again. A newspaper article clipped to the manuscript notes that James killed Ellen with a shotgun before turning the weapon on himself.|$|R
