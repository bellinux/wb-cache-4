5|$|Almost {{a million}} slaves in French West Africa {{responded to this}} by moving away from their masters and {{settling}} elsewhere. The French supported these efforts by creating settlements around <b>the</b> <b>Niger</b> River and digging wells for communities elsewhere so they could farm away from their former masters.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the British {{formally}} united <b>the</b> <b>Niger</b> area as the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. Administratively, Nigeria remained {{divided into}} the Northern and Southern Protectorates and Lagos Colony. Inhabitants {{of the southern}} region sustained more interaction, economic and cultural, with the British and other Europeans owing to the coastal economy.|$|E
5|$|Niger {{seed oil}} is {{obtained}} from the edible seeds of <b>the</b> <b>Niger</b> plant, which belongs to the Asteraceae family and of the Guizotia genus. The botanical name of the plant is Guizotia abyssinica. Cultivation for the plant originated in the Ethiopian highlands, and has since spread from Malawi to India.|$|E

These flow southwestward or westward {{directly into the}} Gulf of Guinea. The Dja and Kadéï drain southeastward into the Congo River. In northern Cameroon, the Bénoué River runs north and west and empties into <b>the</b> <b>Niger.</b> The Logone flows northward into Lake Chad, which Cameroon shares with three neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|Ethnocentrism, tribalism, {{religious}} persecution, and prebendalism {{have affected}} Nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960. Kin-selective altruism {{has made its}} way into Nigerian politics, resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate Federal power to a particular region of their interests. Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as MASSOB, Nationalist movements such as Oodua Peoples Congress, Movement for the Emancipation of <b>the</b> <b>Niger</b> Delta and a civil war. Nigeria's three largest ethnic groups (Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba) have maintained historical preeminence in Nigerian politics; competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria is the 12th largest {{producer}} of petroleum {{in the world}} and the 8th largest exporter, and has the 10th largest proven reserves. (The country joined OPEC in 1971). Petroleum plays a large role in the Nigerian economy, accounting for 40% of GDP and 80% of Government earnings. However, agitation for better resource control in <b>the</b> <b>Niger</b> Delta, its main oil producing region, has led to disruptions in oil production and prevents the country from exporting at 100% capacity.|$|E

5|$|The Other Hand, {{also known}} as Little Bee, is a 2008 novel by British author Chris Cleave. It is a dual {{narrative}} story about a Nigerian asylum-seeker and a British magazine editor, who meet during the oil conflict in <b>the</b> <b>Niger</b> Delta, and are re-united in England several years later. Cleave, inspired as a university student by his temporary employment in an asylum detention centre, wrote the book {{in an attempt to}} humanise the plight of asylum-seekers in Britain. The novel examines the treatment of refugees by the asylum system, as well as issues of British colonialism, globalization, political violence and personal accountability.|$|E
5|$|The colony {{supported}} mostly rain-fed agriculture, {{with limited}} irrigation {{for its first}} 30 years. The only cash crops were nuts gathered close to the railroad between Kayes and Bamako. However, following successful tests of growing Egyptian cotton in West Africa during World War I, Émile Bélime began to campaign {{for the construction of}} a large irrigation system along <b>the</b> <b>Niger</b> river. Starting in 1921, significant irrigation projects around Koulikoro and later at Baguinéda-Camp and the Ségou Cercle began to bring water. The French believed this project could rival the major cotton growing centers of Egypt and the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{powerful}} Saharan tribes, Berber {{in origin}} and later adapting to Muslim and Arab cultures, controlled the channels to western Africa by making {{efficient use of}} horse-drawn vehicles and pack animals. The Songhai engaged in a struggle against the Sa'di dynasty of Morocco over {{the control of the}} trans Saharan trade, resulting in damage on both sides and a weak Moroccan victory, further strengthening the uninvolved Saharan tribes. Struggles and disturbances continued till the 14th century, by which the Mandé merchants were trading with the Hausa, between Lake Chad and <b>the</b> <b>Niger.</b> Newer trade routes developed following extension of trade.|$|E
25|$|The Sahel’s {{farmers have}} been largely cleared of blame for the 20th century’s Sahel {{droughts}}. The Sahel region’s droughts in the 1970s and 1980s were caused by the recent warming of the Indian Ocean, rather than by over-farming causing environmental degradation as previously assumed, {{according to a new}} joint Scidev/UN study. With both a 3.5 C. rise in <b>the</b> <b>Niger's</b> temperature over <b>the</b> last decade and with irrigated land accounting for only 0.1% of <b>the</b> <b>Niger's</b> inhabitable land, regular famine crisis is inevitable in most years. Acute water shortages, which are common in the region's harsh weather, make irrigation systems all the more important for the local farmers.|$|R

50|$|The scruples of the British {{government}} being overcome, {{a charter}} was at length granted (July 1886), the National African Company becoming <b>The</b> Royal <b>Niger</b> Company Chartered and Limited (normally shortened to <b>the</b> Royal <b>Niger</b> Company), with Lord Aberdare as governor and Goldie as vice-governor.|$|R
5|$|There {{are small}} {{minorities}} of British, American, East Indian, Chinese (est. 50,000), white Zimbabwean, Japanese, Greek, Syrian and Lebanese immigrants in Nigeria. Immigrants also include those from other West African or East African nations. These minorities mostly reside {{in major cities}} such as Lagos and Abuja, or in <b>the</b> <b>Niger</b> Delta as employees for the major oil companies. A number of Cubans settled in Nigeria as political refugees following the Cuban Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Colonization and {{expansion}} {{of the kingdom of}} Nri was achieved by sending mbùríchi, or converts, to other settlements. Allegiance to the eze Nri was obtained not by military force but through ritual oath. Religious authority was vested in the local king, and ties were maintained by traveling mbùríchi. By the 14th century, Nri influence extended well beyond the nuclear northern Igbo region to Igbo settlements on the west bank of <b>the</b> <b>Niger</b> and communities affected by the Benin Empire. There is strong evidence to indicate Nri influence well beyond the Igbo region to Benin and Southern Igala areas like Idah. At its height, the kingdom of Nri had influence over roughly a third of Igboland and beyond. It reached its furthest extent between 1100 and 1400.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, British {{claims to}} a West African sphere of {{influence}} received recognition from other European nations at the Berlin Conference. The following year, it chartered the Royal Niger Company {{under the leadership of}} Sir George Taubman Goldie. In 1900 the company's territory came {{under the control of the}} British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British protectorate, and part of the British Empire, the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered Benin in 1897, and, in the Anglo-Aro War (1901–1902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up <b>the</b> <b>Niger</b> area to British rule.|$|E

He then seeks to undermine the power of Sumanguru with his allies, Tabon and Wagadou by taking a sacred relic cart to his enemies Niger, Sangaran, Labe, forcing these villages to submit to his rule. He then cuts off Sumanguru's resources by plundering gold {{from the city of}} Djenne; following that, he then takes over <b>the</b> <b>Niger</b> River and destroys all of Sumanguru's military camps in the region, acquiring the allegiance of Sumanguru's former vassals Fakoli and Mema. Sundjata finally assaults the enemy base in Koumbi Saleh, killing Sumanguru once and for all and establishing his sovereignty over the Malian Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{area near}} the border with Cameroon close to the coast is rich {{rainforest}} {{and part of the}} Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests ecoregion, an important centre for biodiversity. It is habitat for the drill monkey, which is found in the wild only in this area and across the border in Cameroon. The areas surrounding Calabar, Cross River State, also in this forest, are believed to contain the world's largest diversity of butterflies. The area of southern Nigeria between <b>the</b> <b>Niger</b> and the Cross Rivers has lost most of its forest because of development and harvesting by increased population, with it being replaced by grassland (see Cross-Niger transition forests).|$|E

5|$|Elephants {{have been}} the subject of {{religious}} beliefs. The Mbuti people of central Africa believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in elephants. Similar ideas existed among other African tribes, who believed that their chiefs would be reincarnated as elephants. During the 10th century AD, the people of Igbo-Ukwu, near <b>the</b> <b>Niger</b> Delta, buried their leaders with elephant tusks. The animals' religious importance is only totemic in Africa but is much more significant in Asia. In Sumatra, elephants have been associated with lightning. Likewise in Hinduism, they are linked with thunderstorms as Airavata, the father of all elephants, represents both lightning and rainbows. One of the most important Hindu deities, the elephant-headed Ganesha, is ranked equal with the supreme gods Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma. Ganesha is associated with writers and merchants and it is believed that he can give people success as well as grant them their desires. In Buddhism, Buddha is said to have been a white elephant reincarnated as a human. In Islamic tradition, the year 570 when Muhammad was born is known as the Year of the Elephant. Elephants were thought to be religious themselves by the Romans, who believed that they worshipped the sun and stars.|$|E
