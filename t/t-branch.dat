40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{consider}} space-time representation to {{the magnetic}} field produced by a right-angle branching discharge. Current pulse starts and propagates to the <b>T-branching</b> point. Then one discharge segment carries {{a part of the}} initial current in the original direction to the first (cloud) terminal point.

This scheme can serve as a rough model of complicated cloud-to-cloud discharge that partially branches to the ground. The report was stimulated by observation of corresponding natural phenomenon in July 1996 at the Ladoga Lake. The discharge structure is shown in Figure 1. The current pulse starts at the point Ol and propagates to the T-junction point OH at which it branches. One segment carries the part of the initial current to the terminal point F. The rest of the current 1 - is directed at a right angle to the terminal point O.

40|$|In pipe systems, {{carrying}} gas {{with high}} velocities, broadband turbulent pulsations {{can be generated}} causing strong vibrations and fatigue failure, called Acoustic Fatigue. This occurs at valves with high pressure differences (i. e. chokes), relief valves and obstructions in the flow, such as sharp bends and <b>T-branches.</b> Characteristic for the turbulent sources is the strong and broadband excitation caused by turbulent flow, complex acoustic response and vibrations. The traditional approach to calculate the response per resonance frequency. This brute force method is too (computational) time consuming and perhaps even not feasible.

40|$|The project 'Strength and {{fracture}} behaviour of branch {{connections and}} elbows under internal pressure load and superimposed external bending moment' (BV IV) {{was carried out}} at MPA Stuttgart from 1989 to 1993. The objective of the project BV IV was to extend the foundations for a safety-relevant assessment of the main coolant pipes (MCP) of primary systems of pressurized water reactors (PWR). This was made by enhancing the state of knowledge of the load bearing behaviour (stress state) {{as well as the}} failure and fracture behaviour (crack initiation, crack propagation, leak-before-break) of degraded branch connections (T-branches) and elbows. The manufacture and design of the T-branches and elbows was performed according to the conditions in the plants KWO, KKS, KWB A, GKN- 1, KKU and KWB B. The dimensions corresponded to those of the main coolant pipe, resp. to the <b>T-branch</b> of the surge line. The T-branches and Elbows were on the one hand made of the material 20 MnMoNi 5 5 (upper shelf impact energy C_v, _t_r_a_n_s_v_e_r_s_e > 150 J) {{and on the other hand}} of a MnMoNiV-special melt (upper shelf impact energy C_v, _t_r_a_n_s_v_e_r_s_e #approx# 50 J). Both materials dispose of comparable strength properties. The loads applied during the tests covered the loading types and levels occurring in the plants as well as those postulated for accidents. In the case of the T-branches the flaws were applied on the inside of the nozzle corner shaped as a quarter-elliptical nozzle corner flaw longitudinal to the run pipe axis, in the case of the elbows the flaws (spark eroded notches, prefatigue cracks) were applied longitudinally on the inside in the area of the bend flanks. The flaw size was chosen in a way to be definitely found by nondestructive examination methods. Five tests with T-branches consisting of a run pipe with set-on nozzle and six tests with 90 elbows were carried out. An external bending moment (in the case of elbows in-plane bending moment with opening mode, in the case of T-branches in-plane at the branch pipe) was applied reaching maximum load resp. until occurrence of leakage (quasistatic load, in the case of elbows also pulsating load). This took place in the tests after attaining the test temperature (temperature of the upper shelf impact energy, for one <b>T-branch</b> made of the special melt the test temperature corresponded to the transitional range of the C_v-T-curve with T 30 C) as well as the static internal pressure (operational pressure, exception one test with <b>T-branch</b> with p_i = 11 MPa).

30|$|Robot {{agent-based}} {{systems are}} considered as an attractive alternative of sensor-based systems {{described in the}} previous subsection for the fully autonomous real-time pipeline inspection and monitoring. For natural gas distribution pipelines, Schempf et al. [27, 28] proposed EXPLORER and GRISLEE that provide the visual inspection of 4 -, 6 -, and 8 -in-diameter pipelines. Although EXPLORER and GRISLEE have comparably good mobility in elbows and <b>T-branches</b> of the pipelines, the inspection using EXPLORER and GRISLEE is cost-expensive and time consuming as the robot itself {{is responsible for the}} inspection of the entire pipeline. Moreover, these systems provide no mean for incident localization. Several other robot agents are proposed for inspecting different diameter pipelines, e.g., [8 – 14]; we direct readers to respective papers for details and only summarize their limitations here. It is worth noticing that these robots are manually controlled and experience several limitations including the following two facts: (i) the topology of the pipeline, where some of them have been used, was made simple and does not have vertical segments and Y- and T-branches; and (ii) the robots exhibit localization problems due to several reasons including wheel slips and undetectability of the markers. Some researchers developed semi-autonomous and autonomous solutions [15 – 17]. KANTARO [15] is an autonomous mobile robot used for the inspection of 200 – 300 -mm-diameter sewer pipelines. It uses a simple moving mechanism which reduces resource usage. However, the localization based on wheel rotations is not efficient because a wheel slip can induce large errors on the location computation. MAKRO [17] is another fully autonomous, untethered, multi-segmented, and self-steering articulated robot. It is designed for inspecting roughly cleaned, non-man-entry sewer pipes with a diameter of 300 – 600 mm at dry weather conditions. Similar to KANTARO, MARKO’s localization technique is not efficient, and it does not have vertical mobility. In addition, certain assumptions such as dried pipelines are not suitable for real-time operations [17].|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{specific}} {{plasma jet}} device named Plasma Gun {{has been developed}} in GREMI for biomedical applications. Recent studies using this device concerned plasma antitumoral effect and potential endoscopic treatments. The plasma gun is based on dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) flushed with rare gases at low flow rates (10 - 1000 sccm), and powered by a pulsed generator. It allows Pulsed Atmospheric- pressure Plasma Streams (PAPS) generation at high velocities (108 cm. s- 1). PAPS can propagate over long distances in dielectric capillaries (from few tens of cm to m). At the capillary outlet, a plasma plume is generated in ambient air, leading to production of reactive species which participate to the plasma treatment. In order to optimize plasma target exposition, {{it is necessary to}} better understand the mechanisms of generation and propagation of the PAPS in the dielectric capillary and at its outlet. In this work, generation and propagation mechanisms were investigated mainly by means of ICCD imaging. Fast ionization wave (FIW) velocity measurements are obtained using a bunch of optical fibers, connected to a PMT, placed along the PAPS propagation path. Two propagation modes have been highlighted: Wall hugging PAPS (Wh-PAPS) and Homogeneous PAPS (H-PAPS). PAPS propagation is dependent on the voltage pulse shape and, to a lesser extent, on the pulse repetition rate and the gas flow rate. It appears that the photo-ionization plays a minor role, but the PAPS propagation mechanisms are clearly dependent on the plasma tail characteristics (namely impedance) [1] that connects the higher intensity zone (corresponding to the FIW front) to the DBD reactor. Indeed, the PAPS propagation is sustained by the high electric field induced by the ionization front. Even at long distances, if the local electric field is high enough {{in the vicinity of the}} FIW, a secondary PAPS can be generated in another capillary close to the initial one through the dielectric wall. A recent study based on a numerical model developed by Z. Xiong and M. J. Kushner at the University of Michigan, has investigated mechanisms of PAPS propagation, splitting and mixing. It has been shown that the PAPS splitting is symmetric, in terms of electron density ne and electron temperature Te [2] as can be a priori estimated from experiments performed in <b>T-branched</b> capillary. Even if there are still discrepancies between calculated and measured velocities, both simulation and experimental data emphasize the key role of the plasma tail between FIW and initial discharge volume on the final characteristics of the plasma created at the capillary outlet.

MethodsBetween January 2010 and January 2013, 46 consecutive patients with TAAAs underwent endovascular aortic repair with mbEVARs. A custom-made device was used in 24 patients (group A, 52 %), with Crawford classification type I, 2 (8 %); type II, 4 (17 %); type III, 9 (38 %); and type IV/V, 9 (38 %), and the a <b>t-branch</b> endograft was used in 22 patients (group B, 47 %), with type II, 9 (41 %); type III, 12 (55 %); and type IV/V, 1 (4 %). The main outcome measure was technical success, defined as successful target revascularization without occlusion of the bridging endografts or type I or III endoleak at the completion angiography. Secondary end points were mortality, unplanned reinterventions, branch occlusion, paraplegia, and persistent (after discharge) paraparesis. ResultsTechnical success was 100 % in both groups. The 30 -day mortality was 8 % in group A (n = 2) and 0 % in group B (P =. 51). Survival rates at 6  months were 71 % in group A (mean follow-up, 13  ± 11  months) and 94 % in group B (mean follow-up, 6  ± 3  months; (P =. 04). There was only one procedure-related death caused by cerebral bleeding and herniation in group A. The freedom-from-reintervention rate at 6  months was 100 % in group A (mean follow-up, 12  ± 11. 5  months) and 90 % in group B (mean follow-up, 6  ± 3. 9  months; P =. 07). No branch occlusions were observed in group A, whereas a branch occlusion occurred in three patients in group B (in all cases the bridging endograft for the renal artery). In two patients, the possible reason for branch occlusion was a thrombophilic disorder, whereas in one patient, the reason remains unknown. Paraplegia was observed in one patient in each group (group A: 4 %; group B: 5 %; P =. 51) and persistent paraparesis in two patients in group A (8 %) and in one patient (5 %) in group B (P =. 94).

Concerning the manufacturing of complex industrial parts with high quality even in small numbers, a reliable and predictive numerical simulation is an inevitable part of the production chain. The simulation program CASTS is based on finite element (FE) approximations. Recently a hybrid approach was developed combining the mathematics of finite elements with the technical advantages of the finite volume (FV) method. In this work a flow solver for the hybrid FE/FV method has been developed. This solver is based on an approximation of velocity and pressure of first order. Thus a stabilization is necessarily required. Hence bubble functions and static condensation are introduced into the FE/FV method. This way discrete bubble stencils are derived. The obtained bubble stabilization is limited for high Reynolds numbers by a conventional pressure stabilizing Petrov-Galerkin method. The stabilized FE/FV method is validated on several flow problems and applied to mold filling. The free surface is modeled using a phase field stabilized volume of fluid (VoF) method.

40|$|The {{research}} {{and application of}} finite element methods {{in the area of}} material processing has increased rapidly in recent years. Application of FEM is reported in the processing of most engineering materials including new materials like metal matrix composites. In metal forming, FEM is mostly applied to conventional forming situations like forging and upsetting, extrusion, drawing, rolling, sheet metal forming, casting and moulding and machining Most of these forming operations are also well analysed by theories of plastic deformation like limit theorems, slip-line field theory etc. In contrast, new and unconventional metal forming cases, which are often very complex, are relatively under-analysed either by the theoretical methods mentioned above or by numerical methods like finite element. This work is mainly devoted to computer simulation and study of one of the unconventional metal forming process called bulge forming. There are various type of industrial products made by bulge forming process. In some processes the main forming load is the hydrostaic pressure {{on the surface of the}} blank plate or shell. While in others, an in-plane compressive load is also applied simultaneously with the pressure load. Depending on the initial blank shape and final product shape, the simultaneous loading case becomes a complex forming situation. This project has simulated the later category of bulge forming by finite element method. Number of such cases were simulated to cover initial blank shape viz flat circular plate, flat rectangular plate and initially curved shell In the latter category axisymmetric expansion of tubes, <b>T-branch</b> forming from straight cylindrical tubes and forming of box-sectioned elbow from cylindrical tubes were simulated.
