5000|$|The {{changes in}} MY 1986 and MY 1987 {{occurred}} in parts. Instead of a drastic change in MY 1987 {{models for the}} above MK1b upgrades, some MK1a parts continued on in early MY 1987 cars while some MK1b parts came on MY 1986 cars as options.

5000|$|The {{second time}} they {{attempted}} to raise the keel, the same tank was used and the tide was not used for leverage. Ed Huseman positioned the tank over the keel and flooded the tank with water to submerge the tank, and then attached the tank to the keel. The next process was to blow out {{the water in the}} tank with the attached keel, and then the two would float to the surface. Ed Huseman figured out that hooking ten air tanks together, containing [...] of air and attaching a garden hose from the air tanks to the tank's <b>top</b> <b>valve,</b> the air at the top would force the water out through the bottom of the tank. Ed Huseman's ingenious idea worked very well. The air blew the water out of a 30 ft x 8 ft tank in about 30 minutes. The keel and the tank floated up to about 4 ft off the reef, however there were rocks about 5 ft that blocked the exit movement of the keel. They tried to pull the tank and keel out one way, but the towboat, a Cal 39 sail boat with a Perkins 4108 50-hp diesel engine, skippered by Dan Cohen, was too far away to tell Cohen that the keel was still stuck in the rocks, and the tow rope snapped into two pieces. [...] After being in the water for over nine hours that day, the four divers almost gave up. One of the divers, Steve Stiener, said they could move the keel, {{and they were able to}} push the tank with just flipper power. The divers all felt that the tank and keel were going to hit more rocks, however the keel and tank moved out of the rock and reef area, went through a bed of seaweed and into dark deep water, and floated to the water's surface. After the broken tow rope was repaired, Cohen started towing the tank and keel out of the rock and the reef area. The exhausted diving crew, after being in the water for two days, and the sailboats left Catalina Island elated, having achieved a successful salvage operation that no one else had been able to accomplish. The tank and 20-ton keel were then towed 24 miles by the Cal 39 Perkins 4108 50-hp diesel engine across the Catalina Channel to Long Beach Harbor.|$|E

30|$|The {{separation}} {{performance of}} activated carbons was evaluated {{according to the}} following procedure. At first, the sapphire cell was dismounted from the apparatus, washed with distilled water, dried, and loaded with a certain mass of activated carbon. Subsequently, the cell was installed into the apparatus again and connected to the blind cell, and the whole system was evacuated. Afterward, the <b>top</b> <b>valve</b> of the sapphire cell was closed and the blind cell was charged with the feed gas until the desired pressure was achieved. The air-bath temperature was then regulated to the desired value. When the temperature and {{the pressure of the}} gas mixture in the blind cell were stable at the specified value for a period of time, the stable pressure of the blind cell was recorded as P 1. Thereafter, the <b>top</b> <b>valve</b> of the sapphire cell was opened and the desired amount of feed gas originating from the blind cell was injected into the sapphire cell. When the pressure of the sapphire cell reached the desired value (recorded as P 0), the <b>top</b> <b>valve</b> was closed. Then, the adsorption separation experiment took place in the sapphire cell. After the pressure of the sapphire cell remained constant for a period of time, the separation process was deemed to have ended. The pressure of the residual gas in the blind cell and in the sapphire cell was recorded as P 2 and PE, respectively. The equilibrium gas mixture in the sapphire cell was sampled under constant pressure by pushing the piston using a hand pump, and the corresponding composition was analyzed by HP 7890 gas chromatography.|$|E

This study compared the midterm echocardiographic parameters of 52 patients undergoing aortic valve replace-ment with a <b>Top</b> Hat <b>valve</b> {{with those in}} other studies of Top Hat or CarboMedics intraannular valves. Echocardiography was performed 6 – 48 months after surgery with Top Hat sizes 21 – 27.

Preoperative and postoperative echocardiographic measurements were compared in 38 patients with aortic valve stenosis.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{population}} dynamics and parasite load of the foraminifer Cibicides antarcticus on its host the Antarctic scallop Adamussium colbecki from three localities differing by sea ice cover within western McMurdo Sound, Ross Sea, Antarctica: Explorers Cove, Bay of Sails and Herbertson Glacier. We also estimated CaCO 3 biomass and annual production for both species. Cibicides populations varied by locality, valve type, and depth. Explorers Cove with multiannual sea ice had larger populations {{than the two}} annual sea ice localities, likely related to differences in nutrients. Populations were higher on Adamussium <b>top</b> <b>valves,</b> a surface that is elevated above the sediment. Depth did not affect Cibicides distributions except at Bay of Sails. Cibicides parasite load (the number of complete boreholes in Adamussium valves) varied by locality between 2 % and 50 %. For most localities the parasite load was < 20 %, contrary to a previous report that ~ 50 % of Cibicides were parasitic. The highest and lowest parasite load occurred at annual sea ice localities, suggesting that sea ice condition is not important. Rather, the number of adults that are parasitic could account for these differences. Cibicides bioerosion traces were categorized into four ontogenetic stages, ranging from newly attached recruits to parasitic adults. These traces provide an excellent proxy for population structure, revealing that Explorers Cove had a younger population than Bay of Sails. Both species are important producers of CaCO 3. Cibicides CaCO 3 biomass averaged 47 - 73 kg ha(- 1) and Adamussium averaged 4987 - 6806 kg ha(- 1) by locality. Annual production rates were much higher. Moreover, Cibicides represents 1. 0 - 2. 3 % of the total host-parasite CaCO 3 biomass.

The screw remains captive on the valve body even when unscrewed fully; it is tightened again after the tire is inflated and the pump removed.

25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the <b>top</b> of the <b>valves.</b> The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the <b>top</b> of each <b>valve</b> stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|R
