Saying your occupation is [...] "assassin" [...] or [...] "professional killer" [...] could, and therefore the 5th Amendment could be invoked as to that question; saying you made $635,000 last year does not provide evidence of anything criminal and thus it could not.|$|E

In an especially unfavourable critique for Rolling Stone magazine, Timothy White described it as [...] "the sorriest grab bag of dreck in recent memory" [...] and lamented {{that none of the}} songs were [...] "the least bit fleshed out", with the listener instead given [...] "an irritating display of disjointed images and unfocused musical snapshots". After opining that, since 1970, [...] "this ex-Beatle has been lending his truly prodigious talents... to some of the laziest records in the history of rock & roll", White wrote: [...] "Who, one felt compelled <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>is</b> in charge here?

2500|$|The Mishna details {{questions}} one is {{obligated to}} ask {{on the night}} of the seder. It is customary for the youngest child present to recite the four questions. Some customs hold that the other participants recite them quietly to themselves as well. In some families, this means that the requirement remains on an adult [...] "child" [...] until a grandchild of the family receives sufficient Jewish education to take on the responsibility. If a person has no children capable of asking, the responsibility falls to their spouse, or another participant. The need <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>is</b> so great that even if a person is alone at the seder they are obligated to ask themselves and to answer their own questions.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the James–Stein estimator dominates the usual estimator for any ν. [...] A natural question <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>is</b> whether the improvement over the usual estimator is independent of the choice of ν. [...] The answer is no. The improvement is small if [...] is large. [...] Thus to get a very great improvement some knowledge of the location of θ is necessary. [...] Of course this is the quantity we are trying to estimate so we don't have this knowledge a priori. [...] But we may have some guess as to what the mean vector is. [...] This can be considered a disadvantage of the estimator: the choice is not objective as it may depend on the beliefs of the researcher.|$|E

"That Maxwell {{should spend}} his efforts upon a romanticized, {{literary}} past {{is no less}} legitimate than the preoccupation of a Chirico with long sad vistas in towns that never were.

The only question we are permitted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>is,</b> [...] "How far can nostalgia go without becoming the mutterings {{of an old man}} in his beer (or his bourbon) who likes to tell you, ad infinitum, about things that have ceased to interest anyone but himself, and himself only because he has nothing better to do?"

2500|$|Few of {{the portraits}} {{attributed}} to Giorgione appear as straightforward {{records of the}} appearance of a commissioning individual, although it is entirely possible that many are. Many can be read as types designed to express a mood or atmosphere, and certainly many of the examples of the portrait tradition Giorgione initiated appear to have had this purpose, and not to have been sold to the sitter. The subjects of his non-religious figure paintings are equally hard to discern. Perhaps the first question <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>is</b> whether there was intended to be a specific meaning to these paintings that ingenious research can hope to recover. Many art historians argue that there is not: [...] "The best evidence, perhaps, that Giorgione's pictures were not particularly esoteric in their meaning is provided by the fact that while his stylistic innovations were widely adopted, the distinguishing feature of virtually all Venetian non-religious painting {{in the first half of}} the 16th century is the lack of learned or literary content".|$|E
2500|$|Given a presheaf, {{a natural}} {{question}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>is</b> {{to what extent}} its sections over an open set U are specified by their restrictions to smaller open sets V'i of an open cover of U. A presheaf is separated if its sections are [...] "locally determined": whenever two sections over U coincide when restricted to each of V'i, the two sections are identical. All examples of presheaves discussed above are separated, since in each case the sections are specified by their values at the points of the underlying space. Finally, a separated presheaf is a sheaf if compatible sections can be glued together, i.e., [...] whenever there is {{a section of the}} presheaf over each of the covering sets V'i, chosen so that they match on the overlaps of the covering sets, these sections correspond to a (unique) section on U, of which they are restrictions. It is easy to verify that all examples above except the presheaf of bounded functions are in fact sheaves: in all cases the criterion of being a section of the presheaf is local in a sense that it is enough to verify it in an arbitrary neighbourhood of each point.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, 16 {{years after}} her debut appearance, Kasumi was {{redesigned}} to look less cartoon-like and more realistic with a [...] "grown up" [...] appearance in DOA5. The game's art director Yuta Saito said, [...] "From DOA4 we wanted to evolve the characters in a slightly realistic direction. The most difficult, and you don't have <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>is</b> Kasumi. Kasumi {{is the face of}} DOA and the eternal heroine. And for such a popular character like Kasumi, to change her form we really needed a lot of courage and it really was a big challenge. But if we didn't do that, we couldn't make DOA5 and we wouldn't be able to show you anything." [...] Producer Yasuke Hayashi said the processn of remodeling Kasumi has sparked most disputes in the development team, especially since she is [...] "a character that is not so much out on the table, with [...] hidden feelings, and it's been difficult to express such a 'hidden look'." [...] GamesRadar noted that [...] "the manga influences on her facial featureswhile still apparenthave been scaled right back nd her boobs seem less ludicrously unmanageable." [...] Itagaki, who has left Team Ninja in 2008, said in 2014: [...] "Straightly speakin’, my daughter was totally ruined, spoiled. I can’t/shouldn’t avert my eyes from that fact.

2500|$|In {{determining}} whether a defendant in a civil rights lawsuit should receive qualified immunity, the first question <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>is</b> whether the plaintiff has alleged a constitutional violation. [...] On the facts presented in this case, the Court concluded that Alabama's use of the hitching post violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. [...] The [...] "unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain constitutes cruel and unusual punishment," [...] and [...] "among unnecessary and wanton inflictions of pain {{are those that are}} totally without penological justification." [...] And the actions of prison officials lack penological justification if they act with deliberate indifference to the health or safety of an inmate. [...] Here it was [...] "obvious" [...] that the Alabama prison guards were deliberately indifferent to Hope's health or safety. [...] Once Hope had been transported back to the prison, concerns about safety had been addressed. [...] There was no emergency situation at hand, yet the prison guards [...] "knowingly subjected [...] to a substantial risk of physical harm, to unnecessary risk of physical pain caused by the handcuffs and the restricted position of confinement for a 7-hour period, to unnecessary exposure to the heat of the sun, to prolonged thirst and taunting, and to a deprivation of bathroom breaks that caused a risk of particular discomfort and humiliation." [...] This was a basic violation of the [...] "dignity of man," [...] which amounts to [...] "gratuitous infliction of wanton and unnecessary pain" [...] prohibited by the law.|$|E
