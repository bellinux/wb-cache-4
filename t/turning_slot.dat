5000|$|A recent {{trend in}} CD {{packaging}} has been packaging CDs in sleeves comparable to LPs. Many of these albums come from Japan. However, a few European and American albums are given LP-style packaging, such as Morrissey's live album Live at Earls Court, The Who's compilation Then and Now, and R.E.M.'s 2-disc version of their greatest hit package, In Time. A similar packaging type {{was also used}} for Phish's 1995 live release A Live One, with the CDs inserted into interior slots perpendicular to the spine rather than the ends. The Beatles' White Album 30th Anniversary re-release was released as essentially a scaled down version of the original release, including card wallets housing the CDs, which in <b>turn</b> <b>slot</b> into the LP-style folder. Unlike the original release, the album was also provided with a plastic protective cover for the package.

50|$|The winding {{specifications}} affect motor performance the most. Changing {{the number}} of <b>turns</b> per <b>slot</b> or the diameter of magnet wire produces results that differ greatly from each other. Environmental temperature affects the magnetic forces of magnets and the winding resistance, and so indicates changes in motor performance. Changing anisotropic magnets from wet to dry results in decreasing stall torques and increasing no-load speed due to the magnetic force being weakened. Magnets are held in a housing for their full capability, while using a thin-wall housing will result in magnetic force leaking through the housing wall. That is where magnet yokes are used to prevent magnetic leakage, thus maintaining the full capacity of the magnets. Phase refers to positional relations between the center line of each polar magnet and the switching position of commutator segments and brushes. Lagging in phase causes inefficiency, electrical noise, and shortened life. To avoid these situations, improved motors are assembled with forward brush-shifting that offsets the armature reaction during load operation to keep them on neutral electrically.|$|R

If only the voltage of the power supply changes, the change in motor performance is {{in direct proportion to}} that change in voltage. Unlike the constant-voltage power supply, the power supply with resistance will have a voltage drop due to its internal resistance, causing the stall current and, therefore, the stall torque to drop with the speed line bottomed to the left.|$|R

30|$|The {{cognitive}} MAC (C-MAC) protocol {{proposed in}} Cordeiro and Challapali (2007) operates over multiple channels.

A rendezvous channel (RC) is utilized for coordination amongst nodes in different channels. The RC is decided dynamically and in a totally distributed fashion. The functionality and {{the operation of the}} C-MAC protocol are heavily dependent on the rendezvous channel (RC), {{which is one of the}} white spaces in the FCL.

50|$|The slotted optical switch, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} opto switch or optical switch {{but not to}} be confused with the optical component, is a device comprising a photoemitter (e.g. LED) and a photodetector (e.g. photodiode) mounted in a single package so that the photoemitter normally illuminates the photodetector, but an opaque object can be inserted in a slot between them so as to break the beam. Associated circuitry is provided which changes state when the beam is interrupted. For example, the carriage of a computer printer may be fitted with a projection which interrupts the beam of a slotted switch when it reaches the end of its travel, causing circuitry to react appropriately. Another application of the slotted switch is in the type of computer mouse with a rotating ball. The ball measures distances moved by rotating orthogonal shafts which drive optical chopper wheels <b>turning</b> in the <b>slots</b> of slotted switches.|$|R

30|$|A {{semantic}} frame[19] is a {{data structure}} {{that represents the}} semantic concepts in a spoken utterance which users are likely to refer when they control a device by voice. Each semantic frame is composed of <b>slots,</b> which in <b>turn</b> contain <b>slots</b> or values. Different commands with a similar structure are represented by the same semantic frame structure but use different slot values. For example, the correspondence between commands like ‘Switch off the kitchen light’ and ‘Switch on the bathroom light’ could consist of a switching action on the object, here ‘light’, at a particular location. A semantic frame with three slots, labelled by <action><action>, <object> <object> and <location> <location> is a possible generic structure for parsing such commands. The values in the slots relate to the concepts describing the intended setting. Each slot allows the selection of one value from a predefined list, such as <on, off, … ><on, off, … >, <lights, … > <lights, … > and <kitchen, bathroom, … > <kitchen, bathroom, … > in this example. The values also relate to the functionality of the devices, and this {{can be understood as}} a place holder with the potential capacity to hold a spoken word or phrase referring to a relevant concept. For instance, the semantic frame structure in the example above also covers commands like ‘Turn on the light in the kitchen’, where the spoken phrase ‘Turn on’ is related to the value <on><on>. The challenge is in learning to distinguish the semantic frame and filling in the correct values in the relevant slots, allowing the user to choose his own words and using his own pronunciations.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Winding {{failures}} in induction machines {{have been a}} major concern in the past several years, and more so recently with the addition of variable speed drives (VSDs). Both the introduction of the vacuum breaker, and the use of pulse width modulation (PWM) drives, utilizing fast switching IGBT’s, have resulted in an increase in winding {{failures in}} induction machines. Two mechanisms that cause winding failures are steep-fronted surges, like those caused during the opening and closing of vacuum breakers, and transient overvoltages caused by impedance mismatch between the cable and load during VSD operation. There has been a fair amount of work done to date on the propagation of vacuum breaker induced steep-fronted surges in the windings of the induction machine. More recently, work has been progressing on overvoltages at the machine terminals as a result of VSD’s operating with long cables connecting drive and machine. However the propagation of these surges down the coils and the interference of these PWM surges with each other in the coils as well as the coupling between turns and coils have not been thoroughly investigated. Such an investigation would allow more benign PWM strategies to be developed, which do not build up in the machine to unacceptably high levels. To this end, this paper presents a measurement technique which can be used to study PWM generated surges and their propagation within the coil, considering each turn at a time. This requires the inclusion of the differences in the surge impedances in each section of the coil. Detailed parameter measurements are made of each <b>turn</b> section (<b>slot</b> vs. overhang), which are then used to determine the surge impedance of each section. Reflection and refraction coefficients are calculated, then used to map, via lattice diagrams, the propagation of surges within the turns of one coil...|$|R

30|$|This study aims {{to solve}} time-space {{uncertainties}} {{due to the}} narrow network channel bandwidth and long transmission delay of an underwater acoustic sensor network when a node is using a channel. This study proposes a MAC protocol (BSPMDP-MAC) for an underwater acoustic sensor network {{based on the belief}} state space. This protocol can averagely divide the time axis of a sensor’s receiving nodes into n slots. The action state information of a sensor’s transmission node was divided by the grades of link quality and the residual energy of each node. The receiving nodes would obtain the decision strategy sequence of the usage rights of the competitive channels of the sensor’s transmission nodes according to the joint probability distributions of historical observations and action information of channel occupancy. The transmission nodes will transmit data packets to the receiving nodes in <b>turns</b> in allocated <b>slots,</b> according to the decision strategy sequence, and the receiving nodes will predict the channel occupancy and perceive the belief states and access actions in the next cycle, according to the present belief states and actions. These experimental simulation results show that this protocol can reduce the collision rate of data packets, improve the network throughput and transmission success rate of data packets, and reduce the energy overhead of the network.|$|R
40|$|High-powered motors {{typically}} have very low resistance and inductance (R and L) in their windings. This makes the pulse-width modulated (PWM) {{control of the}} current very difficult, especially when the bus voltage (V) is high. These R and L values are dictated by the motor size, torque (Kt), and back-emf (Kb) constants. These constants are in turn set by the voltage and the actuation torque-speed requirements. This problem is often addressed by placing inductive chokes within the controller. This approach is undesirable in that space is taken and heat {{is added to the}} controller. By keeping the same motor frame, reducing the wire size, and placing a correspondingly larger number of <b>turns</b> in each <b>slot,</b> the resistance, inductance, torque constant, and back-emf constant are all increased. The increased inductance aids the current control but ruins the Kt and Kb selections. If, however, a fraction of the turns is moved from their "correct slot" to an "incorrect slot," the increased R and L values are retained, but the Kt and Kb values are restored to the desired values. This approach assumes that increased resistance is acceptable to a degree. In effect, the heat allocated to the added inductance has been moved from the controller to the motor body, which in some cases is preferred...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{approximation}} and online algorithms {{for a few}} different problems. 1) There have been continued improvements in the approximation algorithms for packing and covering problems. Some recent algorithms, including Fastpc, have provable good worst-case running times, {{but it is not}} known how they perform in practice compared to the simplex and interior-point algorithms that are widely used to solve these problems. We present an empirical comparison of these algorithms, using our own implementation of Fastpc and CPLEX implementations of simplex and interior-point methods. We use a variety of inputs for this experimental study. We find that Fastpc is slower for small problem instances, but its performance, relative to CPLEX algorithms, improves as the instances get bigger. Our experiments show that for reasonably large inputs Fastpc performs better than the CPLEX algorithms. 2) We give deterministic algorithms for some variants of online file caching by reducing the problems to online covering. The variants considered in this study include {{one or both of the}} following features: (i) a rental cost for each slot occupied in the cache, and (ii) zapping a file by paying a cost so that the zapped file does not occupy any space in the cache and does not incur any retrieval cost. The rental cost is motivated by the idea of energy efficient caching where caching systems can save power by <b>turning</b> off <b>slots</b> not being used to store files. Our approach is based on the online covering algorithm by Koufogiannakis and Young. We give deterministic lower bounds for these variants, which are tight within con-stant factors of the upper bounds for most of the cases. We also give randomized algorithms and lower bounds for the variants with rental cost. 3) We introduce online Huffman coding. In Huffman coding, the symbols are drawn from a probability distribution and revealed one by one, and the goal is to find a minimum cost prefix-code for the symbols. In the online version, the algorithm has to assign a codeword to a symbol when it is revealed for the first time. We propose an online greedy algorithm and show that it is constant-competitive for online Huffman coding. We also show a lower bound of 10 / 9 on the competitive ratio of any deterministic online algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – A {{number of}} {{algorithmic}} and protocol assumptions {{taken for granted}} {{in the design of}} existing wireless communication technologies need to be revisited in extending their scope to the new cognitive radio (CR) paradigm. The fact that channel availability can rapidly change over time and the need for coordinated quiet periods in order to quickly and robustly detect the presence of incumbents, {{are just some of the}} examples of the unique challenges in protocol and algorithm design for CR networks and, in particular, in the medium access control (MAC) layer. With this in mind, in this paper we introduce a novel cognitive MAC (C-MAC) protocol for distributed multi-channel wireless networks. C-MAC operates over multiple channels, and hence is able to effectively deal with, among other things, the dynamics of resource availability due to primary users and mitigate the effects of distributed quiet periods utilized for primary user signal detection. In C-MAC, each channel is logically divided into recurring superframes which, in <b>turn,</b> include a <b>slotted</b> beaconing period (BP) where nodes exchange information and negotiate channel usage. Each node transmits a beacon in a designated beacon slot during the BP, which helps in dealing with hidden nodes, medium reservations, and mobility. For coordination amongst nodes in different channels, a rendezvous channel (RC) is employed that is decided dynamically and in a totally distributed fashion. Among other things, the RC is used to support network-wide multicast and broadcast which are often neglected in existing multi-channel MAC protocols. We present promising performance results of C-MAC. We also describe our efforts to implement features of C-MAC in a real CR prototype with Atheros chipset, which currently includes the spectrum sensing module and preliminary features of C-MAC.

But {{there are still some}} shortcomings of this electric vehicle components, one of which is the low value of power density of existing electric motor in the market today. On vehicles such as electric cars when Race Car Contest, energy saving problems about power density of the driving motor is very vital. This is because the total weight of the vehicle has a huge influence on the vehicle efficiency is against it. The issue {{is one of the reasons}} of the research task. In this final task is done making the design, simulation, and architecture of the Axial Halbach Brushless DC Motor. Use of system configuration on the halbach magnet to avoid the use of iron as a material cantilever rotor. By changing the material of the cantilever rotor with lighter materials such as aluminum or even carbon fibre, the value of power density electric motors can be increased. Then using the litz wire on coil stator to reduce loss-power loss due to the barriers on the coil. Coreless stator on the system and to avoid the phenomenon of cogging at the time due to low rpm style attraction magnet with iron in the core material. While the creation process begins by determining the specifications of the Axial Halbach Brushless DC motors. Then go into the design phase of the mechanical and electrical design. Who then conducted simulations to help determine other parameters such as air gap, <b>slot</b> <b>turn,</b> and magnetic orientation. The process of making a component of stator and rotor after the simulation is completed. After all the components of the rotor and stator on assembly, mounting the hall sensor is carried out to the right to position obtained by reading the signals. After the motor can spin with good motor performance, testing can be done. This final task generates Axial Halbach Brushless DC Motor with construction of one rotor and a stator. Axial DC Brushless Halbach Motor consists of 10 pole halbach magnet system permanent and 30 slot on the stator. On the performance test of Axial Halbach Brushless DCMotor it obtained efficiency of 92. 72 %, power output of 807. 34 Watts, torque of 2. 24 Nm, moment rpm 3451. As well as the power density of 0. 588 kW/kg at 50 % throttle opening...|$|R
