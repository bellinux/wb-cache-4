25|$|The Sioux and Haida also {{carved out}} sizable nations in North America. The Haida {{returned}} {{to the practice of}} slavery, raiding the Oregon coast for new slaves. The Sioux live a nomadic lifestyle, <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> herds and hunting buffalo, though also raiding their neighbors unless they are paid protection money. The Sioux made an unsuccessful attempt to conquer Fargo and Marshall, and fought a war with the Church Universal and Triumphant that led to a peace treaty seen as somewhat unfavorable to the Sioux.|$|E
25|$|At the end {{of their}} yearly raids, usually in the late winter or spring, the Comanche drove their {{captured}} livestock back to Texas. They sold or traded the horses and mules at several American trading posts as far north as Bent's Fort in Colorado. They needed the captives, mostly children, as laborers. The boys were put to work <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> horse herds. The girls assisted in household chores, including preparing buffalo skins for sale as robes. The boys often grew up to be Comanche warriors and the girls often became one of several wives of Comanche men. A few of the captives were ransomed.|$|E
30|$|Gupta and Singh (2010) {{argued that}} HPWS might send message to {{employees}} that their employers have trust on them, <b>taking</b> <b>cares</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> well-being, and that’s why flourishing humanistic values. By holding these reciprocity sentiments, employees {{will tend to}} enhance their personal efforts and contributions and consequently get involve in exhibiting extra-role behaviors (Tsui et al. 1997). Chuang and Liao (2010) argued that HPWS nurtured the shared perceptions related to supportive organizational environment that foster discretionary behaviors among employees that make positive contributions to organizational performance and effectively cope with customer’s needs. Snape and Redman (2010) reported that HRM practices positively influence the organizational citizenship behavior in employees from North- East England.|$|R

Women in rural parts of Pakistan are typically responsible to fetch water for their family needs.

25|$|When two of Liza's female {{teachers}} (who live together) go {{on vacation}} during spring break, she volunteers {{for the job of}} <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> home and feeding their cats. The two girls stay at the house together, but in an unexpected turn of events a Foster Academy administrator discovers Liza and Annie together. Liza is forced to tell her family about her relationship with Annie, and the headmistress of her school organizes a meeting of the school's board of trustees in order to expel Liza. The board rules in favor of Liza staying at Foster, and she is allowed to keep her position as student president. However, the two teachers, who in the process are discovered to be gay, are fired. After their initial shock at discovering the girls together, the teachers are very supportive and {{go out of their way}} to reassure Liza not to worry about their dismissal, but a few ignorantly insensitive responses end up pushing Liza to leave Annie.|$|E
25|$|Individual ants do not exhibit complex behaviours, yet {{a colony}} of ants collectively {{achieves}} complex tasks such as constructing nests, <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> young, building bridges and foraging for food. A colony of ants can collectively select (i.e. send most workers towards) the best, or closest, food source from several in the vicinity. Such collective decisions are achieved using positive feedback mechanisms. Selection of the best food source is achieved by ants following two simple rules. First, ants which find food return to the nest depositing a pheromone chemical. More pheromone is laid for higher quality food sources. Thus, if two equidistant food sources of different qualities are found simultaneously, the pheromone trail to the better one will be stronger. Ants in the nest follow another simple rule, to favor stronger trails, on average. More ants then follow the stronger trail, so more ants arrive at the high quality food source, and a positive feedback cycle ensures, resulting in a collective decision for the best food source. If there are two paths from the ant nest to a food source, then the colony usually selects the shorter path. This is because the ants that first return to the nest from the food source {{are more likely to}} be those that took the shorter path. More ants then retrace the shorter path, reinforcing the pheromone trail.|$|E

40|$|Patients {{with severe}} mental illness have an {{accumulation}} of risk factors for physical diseases like cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus and COPD. These patients receive suboptimal care in the Netherlands. A major barrier to optimal care {{is the lack of}} collaboration between mental health professionals and general practitioners. An improvement could be made if all medical professionals actively supported these high-risk patients in <b>taking</b> adequate <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> health needs. This improvement can only be made if general practitioners and mental health professionals collaborate in a timely and structured manner...|$|R

500|$|Agneta Wilhelmina Johanna van Marken-Matthes [...] (4 October 1847 – 5 October 1909) was a Dutch entrepreneur. She and {{her husband}} Jacques van Marken were {{involved}} in the manufacture of yeast throughout their lives, and were engaged in the cooperative movement, <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> workers. Matthes and Van Marken created living quarters for workers in her hometown, Delft in South Holland, named Agnetapark after her. These are considered a model for the cooperative development and construction of garden cities (self-contained communities) for workers. Matthes founded and ran a Delft perfume factory, Maison Neuve, {{to take advantage of a}} by-product from the yeast factory.|$|E

40|$|The random {{convex hull}} of a Poisson point process in R^d whose {{intensity}} measure is {{a multiple of}} the standard Gaussian measure on R^d is investigated. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to invent a new viewpoint on these Gaussian polytopes that is based on cumulants and the general large deviation theory of Saulis and Statulevičius. This leads to new and powerful concentration inequalities, moment bounds, Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund-type strong laws of large numbers, central limit theorems and moderate deviation principles for the volume and the face numbers. Corresponding results are also derived for the empirical measures induced by these key geometric functionals, <b>taking</b> thereby <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> spatial profiles...|$|R

She did so by working as a nurse in Castiglione and Mantua. Her devotion to the Blessed Virgin and her generous service to the sick and the poor drew her closer to Christ. Profoundly {{attracted}} to the Heart of Jesus, she opened her life to the action of divine grace and to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, journeying with faith and courage along the path that God prepared for her. So, after having set her siblings in a decorous place, she surrendered herself totally to God.|$|R

2500|$|Adoption is {{a result}} of three situations: when queens lose their nests and [...] "make the best of a bad situation"; workers leave multiple-foundress nests; and {{subordinates}} employ a [...] "sit-and-wait" [...] strategy, waiting for nests to be abandoned. Nests are orphaned when the adult wasps die while <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> nest, leaving an immature brood. Orphaned nests allow a new wasp to gain status as queen without a fight. Females that adopt nests are less cooperative and expend less energy than those that found nests. Spring foundresses sometimes found colonies alone, form associations with others, take over established conspecific colonies, or even adopt abandoned nests. Females would adopt an abandoned nest if they lost their nest due to predation or other damage or if they waited to adopt an orphaned nest rather than found their own. Females engaging in the [...] "sit-and-wait" [...] reproductive strategy adopted the most mature nest rather than the nest with an increased probability of containing kin (from the same population). Females prioritize the quality of the nest over rescuing possible kin from another abandoned nest. Females demonstrate a preference for mature nests and nests with a large proportion of fourth- and fifth-instar larvae. When a female adopts an orphaned nest, she destroys the existing eggs and larvae, but allows older larvae and pupae to complete development. Adopting a nest maximizes the potential of possessing a mature preworker phase colony without expending excessive energy during the nest founding period or cooperating {{in the construction of the}} nest.|$|E

30|$|The goal of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) is to {{efficiently}} and effectively link relevant biomedical articles to meet physicians’ needs for <b>taking</b> better <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> patients. In CDS applications, the patient records are considered as queries and the biomedical articles are retrieved {{in response to}} the queries. A major difference between CDS and traditional IR tasks is that the documents, mostly scientific articles, are very long and contain comprehensive information about a specific topic such as a treatment for a disease, or a patient case. As a result, the CDS queries, although longer than those in other IR tasks, may not cover the various aspects of the user information need, and simple document-query matching does not lead to optimal effectiveness in the CDS task.|$|R
