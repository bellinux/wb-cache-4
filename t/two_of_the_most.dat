5|$|As the 1910s unfolded, attitudes {{hardened}} on {{both sides}} of the emancipation issue. In 1912 the anti-suffrage WNASL was amalgamated into the newly formed National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage (NLOWS), and that year a branch of the NLOWS was established in Bangor. Of the 286 branches of the organisation, 19 were eventually formed in Wales. <b>Two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> prolific supporters of the NLOWS in Wales were both Members of Parliament; Ivor Guest (Cardiff) and J.

5|$|By the 1820s, an {{extensive}} canal system had been constructed, giving {{greater access to}} natural resources and fuel for industries. During the Victorian era, the population of Birmingham grew rapidly to well over half a million and Birmingham became the second largest population centre in England. Birmingham was granted city status in 1889 by Queen Victoria. Joseph Chamberlain, mayor of Birmingham and later an MP, and his son Neville Chamberlain, who was Lord Mayor of Birmingham and later the British Prime Minister, are <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> well-known political figures who have lived in Birmingham. The city established its own university in 1900.|$|E

5|$|Diving {{medicine}} is the diagnosis, treatment {{and prevention of}} conditions caused by exposing divers to the underwater environment. It includes the effects {{on the body of}} pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how fitness to dive affects a diver's safety. Hyperbaric {{medicine is}} another field associated with diving, since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber with hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the definitive treatment for <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important diving-related illnesses, DCS and arterial gas embolism.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium carbonate, Dy2(CO3)3, and {{dysprosium}} sulfate, Dy2(SO4)3, {{result from}} similar reactions. Most dysprosium compounds are soluble in water, though dysprosium carbonate tetrahydrate (Dy2(CO3)3·4H2O) and dysprosium oxalate decahydrate (Dy2(C2O4)3·10H2O) are both insoluble in water. <b>Two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> abundant dysprosium carbonates, tengerite-(Dy) (Dy2(CO3)3·2–3H2O) and kozoite-(Dy) (DyCO3(OH)) {{are known to}} form via a poorly ordered (amorphous) precursor phase with a formula of Dy2(CO3)3·4H2O. This amorphous precursor consists of highly hydrated spherical nanoparticles of 10–20nm diameter that are exceptionally stable under dry treatment at ambient and high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Having {{between a}} fifth or sixth of the arable or good {{pastoral}} land and {{roughly the same}} amount of coastline as England and Wales, marginal pastoral agriculture and fishing were <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important aspects of the Medieval Scottish economy. With poor communications, in the Early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in agriculture. Most farms were based around a family unit and used an infield and outfield system. Arable farming grew in the High Middle Ages and agriculture entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century, the Yucatán Peninsula was still {{dominated}} by the Maya civilization. It was divided {{into a number of}} independent provinces that shared a common culture but varied in their internal sociopolitical organisation. When the Spanish discovered Yucatán, the provinces of Mani and Sotuta were <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important polities in the region. They were mutually hostile; the Xiu Maya of Mani allied themselves with the Spanish, while the Cocom Maya of Sotuta became the implacable enemies of the European colonisers.|$|E
5|$|In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu {{emerged as}} a {{principal}} centre in the Late Preclassic.

5|$|Mecoptera {{have special}} {{importance}} {{in the evolution of}} the insects. <b>Two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important insect orders, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and Diptera (true flies), along with Trichoptera (caddisflies), probably evolved from ancestors belonging to, or strictly related to, the Mecoptera. Evidence includes anatomical and biochemical similarities as well as transitional fossils, such as Permotanyderus and Choristotanyderus, which lie between the Mecoptera and Diptera. The group was once much more widespread and diverse than it is now, with four suborders during the Mesozoic.|$|E

5|$|On 17 June 1936, all {{police forces}} {{throughout}} Germany were united under {{the purview of}} Himmler and the SS.

Police and intelligence forces brought under their administrative control included the SD, Gestapo, Kriminalpolizei (Kripo; criminal investigative police), and Ordnungspolizei (Orpo; regular uniformed police). In September 1939, the security and police agencies, including the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo; security police) and SD (but not the Orpo), were consolidated into the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), headed by Heydrich. This further increased the collective authority of the SS.|$|E
