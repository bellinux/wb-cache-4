A farmer discovers <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> <b>door</b> is open and suspects trespassers. He enters the barn, nearly catching Homer and Marge, who are hiding in the hay loft, but leaves after failing to locate them. When the coast is clear, Homer and Marge have inspired sexual intercourse in the hay loft.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2005, after Alan Greenspan {{expressed}} concern over housing markets, Krugman criticized Greenspan's earlier reluctance {{to regulate the}} mortgage and related financial markets, arguing that [...] " [...] {{like a man who}} suggests leaving <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> <b>door</b> ajar, and then – after the horse is gone – delivers a lecture on the importance of keeping your animals properly locked up." [...] Krugman has repeatedly expressed his view that Greenspan and Phil Gramm are the two individuals most responsible for causing the subprime crisis. Krugman points to Greenspan and Gramm for the key roles they played in keeping derivatives, financial markets, and investment banks unregulated, and to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed Great Depression era safeguards that prevented commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies from merging.|$|E
2500|$|The {{floor plan}} of aisled barns {{resembles that of}} an aisled church. However, the nave in farm {{buildings}} is called an aisle thus a [...] "three aisled barn". Aisled <b>barns</b> have <b>the</b> big <b>barn</b> <b>doors</b> on <b>the</b> gable end of the building giving access to the center aisle, often called the drive floor or threshing floor. The side aisles may be the same widths making <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> symmetrical or <b>the</b> aisle where animals were housed may be narrower which is apparent outside <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> because <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> <b>doors</b> are then off-center. The area between the posts, perpendicular to the aisles are called bays. In stables there is a stable aisle down the centre with individual stalls facing the aisle.|$|R

25|$|Some 19th-century barns {{found in}} other parts of the U.S. may have some {{similarities}} with <b>the</b> New England <b>barn</b> but are distinctly different. <b>The</b> Pennsylvania <b>barn</b> has <b>doors</b> on <b>the</b> sidewall like <b>the</b> English <b>barn</b> but is a larger, bank <b>barn</b> with <b>the</b> cows housed in the basement, and has one or more distinctive forebays (cantilevered walls). The New World Dutch barn (Dutch barn) has similarities to <b>the</b> New England <b>barn</b> with <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> <b>doors</b> on <b>the</b> gable ends, but <b>the</b> Dutch <b>barns</b> are a much older type and are framed with the classic anchor beam framing.

This paper covers the evolution of Intel Intemet access policy, a continual struggle to close <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> <b>doors</b> before <b>the</b> horses get out.

It discusses Intel's first taste of the Internet, Intel's policy-making process, the open access policy of that period, and the resulting security challenges.

The paper proceeds to describe today's problems, the majority of which center around Intel people accessing the Intemet. In response to this problem and growing numbers of people wanting to use the Internet, Intel has drawn up explicit corporate guidelines on Internet use. These guidelines are then compared to various Acceptable Use Policies and Netiquette guides.
