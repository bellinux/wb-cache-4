5000|$|Strix is a genus of <b>owls</b> in the <b>typical</b> <b>owl</b> family (Strigidae), {{one of the}} two {{generally}} accepted living families of owls, with the other being the barn-owl (Tytonidae). Common names are earless owls or wood owls, though they are not the only owls without ear tufts, and [...] "wood owl" [...] is also used as a more generic name for forest-living owls. Neotropical birds in the genus Ciccaba are sometimes included in Strix.|$|R
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} {{is a member}} of the wood-owl genus Strix, part of the <b>typical</b> <b>owl</b> family Strigidae, which {{contains}} all species of owl other than the barn owls. Within its genus, the tawny owl's closest relatives are Hume's owl, Strix butleri, (formerly considered to be conspecific), the Himalayan owl, Strix nivicolum, (sometimes considered conspecific), its larger northern neighbour, the Ural owl, S. uralensis, and the North American barred owl, S. varia. The Early–Middle Pleistocene Strix intermedia is sometimes considered a paleosubspecies of the tawny owl, which would make it that species' immediate ancestor.|$|R

5|$|The {{barn owl}} (Tyto alba) {{is the most}} widely {{distributed}} species of owl {{and one of the}} most widespread of all birds. It is also referred to as the common barn owl, to distinguish it from other species in its family, Tytonidae, which forms one of the two main lineages of living owls, the other being the <b>typical</b> <b>owls</b> (Strigidae). The barn owl is found almost everywhere in the world except polar and desert regions, Asia north of the Himalayas, most of Indonesia, and some Pacific islands.|$|E

5000|$|The {{short-eared owl}} (Asio flammeus) is {{a species of}} <b>typical</b> <b>owl</b> (family Strigidae). Owls {{belonging}} to genus Asio are known as the eared owls, as they have tufts of feathers resembling mammalian ears. These [...] "ear" [...] tufts {{may or may not}} be visible. Asio flammeus will display its tufts when in a defensive pose, although its very short tufts are usually not visible. The short-eared owl is found in open country and grasslands. The scientific name is from Latin. The genus name Asio is a type of eared owl, and flammeus means [...] "flame-coloured".|$|R

What are <b>typical</b> <b>OWL</b> users to do when their favorite reasoner never seems to return? In this paper, we present our first steps considering this problem. We describe the challenges and our approach, and present a prototype tool to help users identify reasoner performance bottlenecks {{with respect to their}} ontologies. We then describe 4 case studies on synthetic and real-world ontologies. While the anecdotal evidence suggests that the service can be useful for both ontology developers and reasoner implementors, much more is desired. ...|$|R
5000|$|Greater sooty owls are {{territorial}} and {{are thought}} {{to remain in the}} same area throughout their adult lives.

25|$|Scops owls are <b>typical</b> <b>owls</b> (family Strigidae) mostly {{belonging}} to the genus Otus. Approximately 45 living species are known, but new ones are frequently recognized and unknown ones are still being discovered every few years or so, especially in Indonesia. For most of the 20th century, this genus included the American screech owls, which are now again separated in Megascops based {{on a range of}} behavioral, biogeographical, morphological and DNA sequence data. Otus is the largest genus of owls in terms of number of species.|$|E
500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the barn owl does not hoot (such calls {{are made by}} <b>typical</b> <b>owls,</b> like the tawny owl or {{other members of the}} genus Strix). It instead {{produces}} the characteristic shree scream, ear-shattering at close range, an eerie, long-drawn-out shriek. Males in courtship give a shrill twitter. Both young and old can hiss like a snake to scare away intruders. Other sounds produced include a purring chirrup denoting pleasure, and a [...] "kee-yak", which resembles one of the vocalisations of the tawny owl. When captured or cornered, the barn owl throws itself on its back and flails with sharp-taloned feet, making for an effective defence. In such situations it may emit rasping sounds or clicking snaps, produced probably by the beak but possibly by the tongue.|$|E
500|$|The {{barn owl}} is a medium-sized, pale-coloured owl with long wings and a short, squarish tail.

However, the largest bodied race of barn owl, T. a. furcata from Cuba and Jamaica, is also an island race, albeit being found on more sizeable islands with larger prey and few larger owls competing for dietary resources. The shape of the tail is a means of distinguishing the barn owl from <b>typical</b> <b>owls</b> when seen in the air. Other distinguishing features are the undulating flight pattern and the dangling, feathered legs. The pale face with its heart shape and black eyes give the flying bird a distinctive appearance, like a flat mask with oversized, oblique black eye-slits, the ridge of feathers above the beak somewhat resembling a nose.|$|E
50|$|P. prigoginei is {{not well}} known and was {{initially}} considered a subspecies of P. badius; today, however, {{it is not clear}} whether the African species would not be better placed in Tyto or a monotypic genus. It is similar to the other Phodilus species in being smaller than <b>typical</b> barn <b>owls,</b> and having the more U-shaped facial disk; however, the ear-like feather tufts are hardly visible.|$|R
50|$|This <b>typical</b> <b>owl</b> {{is found}} in {{subtropical}} to temperate forests in Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, and Vietnam. They inhabit the Himalayan foothills from Kashmir and Garhwal east to the mountains of Laos and Vietnam and in southern China up to Chekiang and Anhwei. They require forest tracts and duars bearing mountain streams. In areas such as Darjeeling and Nepal, they commonly live at elevations of 1500 to 2450 m. It more less replaces the buffy fish owl (Bubo ketupu) in range and at one time they {{were considered to be}} of the same species. The tawny fish owl may overlap in range with brown fish owls (B. zeylonensis) in Laos and Vietnam, the brown usually but not always inhabiting lowland areas and preferring slow or stagnant waters unlike the tawny which prefers faster flowing waters. Unlike the brown and buffy fish owls, they are found only in remote wilderness with little to no disturbance. Those other two fish owls (but not the Blakiston's species) can adapt to living and hunting near human habitations or human-altered areas, such as canals, paddy fields, reservoirs, ornamental ponds and villages, which provides them a boon of ornamental and commercial fishes.|$|R

50|$|The true owls or <b>typical</b> <b>owls</b> (family Strigidae) {{are one of}} the two {{generally}} accepted families of owls, the other being the barn owls (Tytonidae). The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy unites the Caprimulgiformes with the owl order; here, the <b>typical</b> <b>owls</b> are a subfamily Striginae. This is unsupported by more recent research (see Cypselomorphae for details), but the relationships of the owls in general are still unresolved.

500|$|The {{barn owl}} {{was one of}} several species of bird first {{described}} in 1769 by the Tyrolean physician and naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in his [...] Anni Historico-Naturales. He gave it the scientific name Strix alba. [...] As more species of owl were described, the genus name Strix came to be used solely for the wood <b>owls</b> in the <b>typical</b> <b>owl</b> family Strigidae, and the barn owl became Tyto alba in the barn owl family Tytonidae. The name literally means [...] "white owl", from the onomatopoeic Ancient Greek tyto (τυτώ) for an owl – compare English [...] "hooter" [...] – and Latin alba, [...] "white". The bird is known by many common names which refer to its appearance, call, habitat, or its eerie, silent flight: white owl, silver owl, demon owl, ghost owl, death owl, night owl, rat owl, church owl, cave owl, stone owl, monkey-faced owl, hissing owl, hobgoblin or hobby owl, dobby owl, white-breasted owl, golden owl, scritch owl, screech owl, straw owl, barnyard owl, and delicate owl. [...] "Golden owl" [...] might also refer to the related golden masked owl (T. aurantia). [...] "Hissing owl" [...] and, particularly in the UK and in India, [...] "screech owl", refers to the piercing calls of these birds. The latter name is also applied to a different group of birds, the screech-owls in the genus Megascops.|$|R
50|$|The {{wing chord}} length is 297 - 400 mm.

50|$|Around the Paleogene-Neogene {{boundary}} (some 25 Mya), barn-owls {{were the}} dominant group of owls in southern Europe and adjacent Asia at least; the distribution of fossil and present-day owl lineages indicates that their decline is contemporary with {{the evolution of the}} different major lineages of <b>typical</b> <b>owls,</b> which for the most part seems to have taken place in Eurasia.

50|$|This {{species is}} a part of the larger family Strigidae of owls, known as <b>typical</b> <b>owls.</b> This family {{contains}} most species of owls.|$|E
50|$|During the Paleogene, the Strigiformes {{radiated}} into ecological niches now mostly {{filled by}} {{other groups of}} birds. The owls as known today, though, evolved their characteristic morphology and adaptations during that time, too. By the early Neogene, the other lineages had been displaced by other bird orders, leaving only barn-owls and <b>typical</b> <b>owls.</b> The latter at that time were usually a fairly generic type of (probably earless) owls similar to today's North American spotted owl or the European tawny owl; the diversity in size and ecology found in <b>typical</b> <b>owls</b> today developed only subsequently.|$|E
5000|$|Pulsatrix perspicillata pulsatrix (Wied-Neuwied, 1820)- Or the [...] "Short-browed Owl"; {{native to}} southeastern Brazil from about Bahia south to Rio Grande do Sul {{in the area}} of Aparados da Serra National Park and also {{bordering}} over into northeastern Argentina. This species has creamy-buff instead of white on the spectacles of the face. P. p. pulsatrix is lighter brown than in any other spectacled owl, with no contrasting darker plumage on the crown and nape as in other races. The breast band is brown and distinctly broken in the center. Main proposed difference (leading to it being considered a full species) is that territorial song is not as ascelerated as in other races. Apparently, where the ranges of more <b>typical</b> spectacled <b>owls</b> overlap with the short-browed types, they do not seem to hybridize. This is the largest variety of Spectacled Owl. Wing is 363 to 384 mm long and tail is 211 to 226 mm. Weight of a single male and single female was 1050 g and 1250 g, conicidentally exactly the same of the maximum weight recorded for the nominate race of Spectacled Owl.|$|R
50|$|At 46 - 50 cm long, the pharaoh eagle-owl {{is one of}} {{the smaller}} eagle-owl species. It is an {{attractive}} bird of prey, with striking, large orange-yellow eyes and mottled plumage. The head and upperparts are tawny and densely marked with black and creamy-white streaks and blotches, while the underparts are pale creamy-white, with black streaks on the upper breast and fine reddish-brown vermiculations on the lower breast and belly. The face has the disc-like form <b>typical</b> of most <b>owls,</b> defined by a dark rim, the robust bill is black and hooked, and the head is crowned with small ear tufts. There are two recognised subspecies of pharaoh eagle-owl, Bubo ascalaphus ascalaphus and B. a. desertorum, the latter being smaller and paler with sandier colouration.|$|R
50|$|This owl is {{a member}} of the <b>typical</b> or true <b>owl</b> family, Strigidae, which {{contains}} most species of owl, the other grouping being the barn owls, Tytonidae. It is a small, cryptically coloured, mainly nocturnal species and is found in a range of habitats including farmland, woodland fringes, steppes and semi-deserts. It feeds on insects, earthworms, other invertebrates and small vertebrates. Males hold territories which they defend against intruders. This owl is a cavity nester and a clutch of about four eggs is laid in spring. The female does the incubation and the male brings food to the nest, first for the female and later for the newly hatched young. As the chicks grow, both parents hunt and bring them food, and the chicks leave the nest at about seven weeks of age.|$|R
