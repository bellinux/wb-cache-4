5|$|The {{description}} of what happens next is deliberately cryptic. Lucius reminds <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> the uninitiated {{are not allowed to}} know the details of the mystery rites, before describing his experience in vague terms.|$|E
5|$|It {{must seem}} to <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> this Colonel Beriah Norton was a traitor {{to his own}} people, but {{what could he do}} but give in to Grey's command! Grey had the force and the power and could have {{destroyed}} the towns on the island in half a day, and would have done so if they had resisted in any way. In the diary, September 12th and 13th are omitted. Those were the days when the British troops were ravaging the island from Edgartown to Gay Head.|$|E
5|$|The end of The Dry Salvages {{starts with}} a {{discussion}} about how people attempt to see the future through various superstitious means. Then the narrator tries to convince <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> resignation about death is necessary. However, such resignation {{should be viewed as}} pushing the self towards redemption and the eternal life in the next world. By acting properly, one would be able to overcome life and move towards the next world.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>reader</b> learns <b>that</b> Khaled {{lives as}} a prosperous and renowned French {{archeologist}} under {{the identity of}} Paul Martineau. He organizes terror attacks through an Arab associate in Marseilles. <b>The</b> <b>reader</b> also discovers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> arrangements for Khaled’s next attack are underway.|$|R
5|$|The {{publication}} of works on archaeology and art {{followed the same}} pattern as with works on physical and natural sciences: that of an itinerary with descriptions of the roads travelled, noteworthy monuments along these routes and descriptions of their destinations. Hence, volume I of Expédition de Morée. Section des Beaux Arts describes Navarino (pp.1–7) with six pages of plates (fountains, churches, the fortress of Navarino and the palace of Nestor at Pylos); then on pages 9–10, the Navarino-Methoni road is detailed with four pages of plates (a church in ruins and its frescoes, but also bucolic landscapes reminding <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> the scene is not so far from Arcadia); and finally three pages on Methoni and four pages of plates. The bucolic landscapes were rather close to the “norm” that Hubert Robert had proposed for depictions of Greece.|$|E
25|$|The trick will be {{to render}} intact the {{magnitude}} of Clarissa's miniature but very real desperation; to fully convince <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that,</b> for her, domestic defeats {{are every bit as}} devastating as are lost battles to a general.|$|E
25|$|Expansion {{at first}} {{use and the}} abbreviation-key feature are aids to <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> {{originated}} in the print era, and they are equally useful in print and online. In addition, the online medium offers yet more aids, such as tooltips, hyperlinks, and rapid search via search engine technology.|$|E

5000|$|The {{next chapter}} {{begins with a}} Thirukkural, which states: [...] "Wisdom is a weapon to ward off destruction;It is an inner {{fortress}} which enemies cannot destroy". This chapter reminds <b>the</b> <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> Ancient India was a [...] "knowledge society that contributed {{a great deal to}} civilization." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1982, Ito {{produced}} a lubricant product and named it [...] "Love Oil". He appealed to <b>the</b> <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> for safer and better sex, they should use condoms and put Love Oil over it. It became another popular product of Barazoku, with average sales of 4000 - 5000 bottles per month.|$|R
25|$|As Marek and {{his team}} search for Johnston in the past, they find {{themselves}} forced to rely deeply on one another for their basic safety. Marek proves to be quite brave, where Kate proves herself to be somewhat fearless. Chris takes longer to prove himself, but, eventually, he shows <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> he is just as brave as Marek.|$|E
25|$|Vitruvius {{illustrates}} this point by naming {{what he considers}} are the most talented individuals in history. Implicitly challenging <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> they {{have never heard of}} some of these people, Vitruvius goes on and predicts that some of these individuals will be forgotten and their works will be lost, while other less deserving political characters of history will be forever remembered with pageantry.|$|E
25|$|In a clear but {{scholarly}} {{analysis of}} the German high command, Megargee shows that the German general staff, despite flashes of real brilliance, had deep, long-term flaws {{in such areas as}} intelligence, logistics, and strategic planning. (...) His analysis reminds <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> it is the drudgery of staff work that often wins and loses wars; it is a tribute to the author's abilities that he can make that fact not only clear but highly interesting.|$|E
30|$|Here, {{we should}} remind <b>the</b> <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reverse of Theorem  2.6 is {{stronger}} than (2.13) and only holds for 0 ≤ν≤ 1 / 4 and 3 / 4 ≤ν≤ 1 in Zhao and Li [8]. We also can see Zhao and Wu [6] for a different method to get Theorem  2.6.|$|R
50|$|In an 2012 {{interview}} Hanna {{was asked}} to share some personal details about herself. Among other things, she told <b>the</b> <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> she is terrified of guns but would love to try skydiving.

25|$|Let's Get Well (1965) was {{her final}} book, {{in which she}} tries to {{convince}} <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> before most diseases develop there were likely nutritional deficiencies that people were not aware of. In the book she discusses nutritional therapy for hundreds of ailments, including heart disease, high cholesterol, ulcers, diabetes, and arthritis, and often contradicts the dietary advice given by many physicians. The book is documented with over 2,000 footnoted references to studies reported in medical journals and books.|$|E
25|$|Walter Lowrie reminds <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> Kierkegaard has said, 'With {{my right}} hand I held out the Edifying Discourses, with my left the {{aesthetic}} works-and all grasped with the right hand what I held in my left.’ This would pair right and left as Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions and Stages on Life’s Way, then Three Discourses in Various Spirits with A Literary Review; and The Lilies of the Field and the Birds of the Air with Either/Or, 2nd edition. He indicates a plan to Kierkegaard's writing.|$|E
25|$|Mysteriously, {{this work}} was a fresco of her father's Cluj University, which Rădulescu may not have {{attended}} at all, to {{the backdrop of the}} Great Depression and political convulsions. Such details renewed speculation that Marta was signing works penned by Dan Rădulescu. The student-narrator takes part in the strike of 1932, where she meets recruiters for both the Romanian Communist Party and the fascist Iron Guard (including a glimpse of the agitator Bănică Dobre). The autofictional Rădulescu informs <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> she prefers the Guard, but attends meetings of the far-left, during which communist activists imply that the difference between them and the fascists is a minor one.|$|E
5000|$|For his motto Bishop Shlesinger {{has adopted}} the Latin phrase “CHRISTUM OPORTET CRESCERE,” that {{is taken from}} the 30th verse of the 3rd chapter of Saint John’s Gospel.

5000|$|Trade {{publications}} keep industry members {{abreast of}} new developments. In this role, it functions similarly to how academic journals or scientific journals serve their audiences. Trade publications include targeted advertising, which earns a {{profit for the}} publication and sales for the advertisers while also providing sales engineering-type advice to <b>the</b> <b>readers,</b> <b>that</b> may inform purchasing and investment decisions.|$|R
25|$|It has {{gradually}} become clear to <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> John Rokesmith is the missing heir, John Harmon. He had been robbed {{of his clothes}} and possessions by the man later found drowned and mis-identified as him. Rokesmith/Harmon has been maintaining his alias {{to find out more}} about Bella Wilfer before committing himself to marry her as required by the terms of his father's will. Now that she has married him, believing him to be poor, he can throw off his disguise. He does so and it is revealed that Mr Boffin's apparent miserliness and ill-treatment of his secretary was part of a scheme to test Bella's motives and affections.|$|E
25|$|February Shadows can be {{categorized}} as a psychological novel. The entire narration is told through first person stream of consciousness, and the plot builds through the unearthing of new memories as they emerge in Hilde's mind. The story is told in a mix {{of past and present}} and the narration switches fluidly {{back and forth between the}} two. The manner of the flashbacks and the inner comments Hilde makes about each informs <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> she wishes to repress the horrific memories of 2 February 1945. Hilde constantly reminds herself to forget the past as if her survival and sanity depended on doing so.|$|E
25|$|Why We Want You to Be Rich {{notes in}} the {{introduction}} it is not intended as a technical manual with specific recommendations. The book warns <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> the American middle class strata is shrinking due to multiple factors including oncoming retirement of the baby boomers, rising costs of light crude oil, decreasing employer pay to employees, increasing national debt of the United States, and a declining power of the United States dollar. The authors caution that individuals should not rely on the federal bureaucracy for support from problems including the middle-class squeeze, economic globalization, and threats of terrorism. They assert that employment opportunities are not formed from the government but rather through entrepreneurship.|$|E

Throughout the text there are boxes of information that capture essential steps or informative pieces <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> should make note of or {{make it a point}} to remember.

50|$|The group pursues the Parasite to Berlin, {{where they}} find he has killed Steelwolf and absorbed his powers. They fight the Parasite who is killed by Superman in an {{apparent}} act of panic. It is revealed to <b>the</b> <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> this Superman is not the traditional character, but rather Zod, another Kryptonian who has the same superpowers, but is a psychopath.|$|R
25|$|Likewise H.D.’s {{revision}} {{of the story of}} Helen of Troy in Helen is an attempt to exonerate women from the blame of the Trojan War. In this sense, form inexorably serves the function and meaning of the poem by indicating to <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> the poem is, if not an epic, epic-like and therefore a history. For some female authors using the well known form of an epic is a way to legitimize their stories, but by slightly altering the epic tradition they also indicate that the traditional way is unacceptable and insufficient for their purposes. Embodying the modernist dilemma, the long poem as epic often contains the seeming belief in the futility of tradition and history paired with the obvious dependence on them.|$|E
25|$|In the ebook The Third Law, Rico Dredd as narrator tells <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> he {{was trying}} to enforce the law in a less remote fashion, {{allowing}} for mercy and accepting the citizens as they were; bribes are explained as a way of making sure the crime lords believed they controlled him and he wasn't the one ensuring they kept restrained. Sex and drinking are shrugged off as perks, and threats to Joe as being the result of drinking. Rico is implied to be an unreliable narrator and this calls his claims into question. Notably, he claims he couldn't shoot Kenner in case the bullets were traced and he used the rad pit to kill him, and regretted 'having' to kill him; the original strip shows him hitting Kenner with an incendary round, shooting his limbs, and mocking him as he dies, using the rad pit to dispose of the corpse. The ebook Wear Iron is told in third-person and describes Rico's thoughts circa 2080: here, when he isn't telling his own story, he's callous, brutal, and sometimes bursts out in manic laughter. He remembers Kenner's murder fondly.|$|E
