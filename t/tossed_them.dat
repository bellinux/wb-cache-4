25|$|In 1842, Njegoš and Ali Pasha {{met at a}} Dubrovnik palace to {{negotiate}} peace. The two eventually reached an agreement, which was signed before representatives of Austria and Russia. As Njegoš and Ali Pasha emerged from the palace, Ali Pasha produced a bag full of gold coins and <b>tossed</b> <b>them</b> into the air, prompting the Montenegrin delegation—which included several chiefs—to scramble after as many as possible. Through this action, Ali Pasha effectively demonstrated Montenegro's poverty before the Austrians and Russians, embarrassing Njegoš in the process.|$|E
25|$|Among the European settlers, hoop-rolling was a {{seasonal}} sport, seeing the greatest {{activity in the}} winter. Children, besides rolling the hoops, also <b>tossed</b> <b>them</b> back and forth, catching them on their sticks. In the 1830s, hoop trundling {{was seen as an}} activity so characteristic of the young that it was adopted by a fanatic sect in Kentucky whose members mimicked children's activities in order to gain access to heaven. Hoop driving was also seen as a remedy for the sedentary and overprotected lives led by many American girls of the mid-19th century. The game was popular with both girls and boys: in an 1898 survey of 1000 boys and 1000 girls in Massachusetts, both the girls and the boys named hoop and stick their favorite toy. In Ohio, the wood of the American elm (Ulmus americana) was particularly valued for making hoop-poles.|$|E
500|$|Hog Island, {{a barrier}} island that was mostly washed {{away by the}} 1893 New York hurricane, was further eroded by the rough seas. Beaches, pavilions, bath houses, and boardwalks on Coney Island {{incurred}} significant damage, with many small buildings along Brighton Beach being [...] "picked up bodily and carried away." [...] Damage on Coney Island was expected to cost at least $200,000. In Far Rockaway, Queens, beachfront houses built on stilts were leveled, while significant flooding extended well inland; multiple hotels were inundated by at least [...] of water. In New England, the storm kept all vessels at port for several days. The strongest recorded winds on land occurred on Block Island, Rhode Island, where gusts reached [...] Elsewhere, winds peaked at [...] on Nantucket, Massachusetts, and [...] at Boston. The storm partially destroyed a seawall and shifted a building off its foundation in Narragansett Pier, Rhode Island. Near South Boston, the storm broke 15 yachts from their moorings and <b>tossed</b> <b>them</b> ashore, sinking several others. The schooner Alsatin sank off Bakers Island; her crew of four was rescued by a passing steamer. At Cohasset, a new lifeboat station constructed by the Massachusetts Humane Society was destroyed. As the former hurricane moved over Nova Scotia, Halifax experienced gusty winds and moderate rainfall.|$|E

2500|$|A {{large crowd}} {{gathered}} outside the court {{house for the}} start of the Patterson trial on Monday, April 2. Without the [...] "vivid detail" [...] she had used in the Scottsboro trials, Victoria Price told her account in 16 minutes. The defense had what she had said before under oath on paper, and could confront her with any inconsistencies.

2500|$|Although {{the captain}} was {{ultimately}} responsible {{for the safety of}} passengers, the owners had made no effort to maintain or replace the ship's safety equipment. The fire hoses had been allowed to rot, and fell apart when the crew tried to put out the fire. The crew had never practiced a fire drill, and the lifeboats were tied up and inaccessible. (Some claim they were wired and painted in place.) Survivors reported that the life preservers were useless and fell apart in their hands. Desperate mothers placed life jackets on their children and <b>tossed</b> <b>them</b> into the water, only to watch in horror as their children sank instead of floating. [...] Most of those on board were women and children who, like most Americans of the time, could not swim; victims found that their heavy wool clothing absorbed water and weighed them down in the river.|$|E

[...] They held the Buckeyes to 60 rushing yards, 46 passing yards, and three first downs. [...] Ohio State completed two of ten passes, with five passes being intercepted by Michigan. [...] Ted Petoskey was reported to be the outstanding player on defense: [...] "Petoskey halted Ohio's rushes at his end, eluded his blockers, pulled down runners at the line of scrimmage and <b>tossed</b> <b>them</b> for losses, coming from behind to make smothering tackles." [...] Bill Renner scored Michigan's first touchdown on a long drive in the second quarter that featured a 19-yard gain on a pass from Renner to John Regeczi and a run by Jack Heston (Willie Heston's son) on Fielding H. Yost's [...] "old 83" [...] play. [...] Renner ran for the touchdown from the three-yard line. [...] The extra point kick by Herman Everhardus was wide, and Michigan led, 6–0.|$|E
