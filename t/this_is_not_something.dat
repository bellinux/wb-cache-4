2500|$|Germ line cells {{develop into}} eggs and sperm and the {{associated}} inherited material can be passed down to future generations. As shown in the associated karyotype image, chromosomes 1–22 are grouped A-G. A population of male grasshoppers (Chorthippus binotatus) from the Sierra Nevada (Spain) are polysomic mosaics (coming from cells of two genetically different types) possessing an extra E group chromosome(chromosomes 16, 17 & 18) in their testicles. [...] Parents that exhibited polysomy did not pass the E chromosome abnormality {{to any of the}} offspring, so <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> that is passed down to future generations. Male grasshoppers (Atractomorpha similis) from Australia carry between one and ten extra copies of chromosome A9, with one being the most common in natural populations. Most polysomic males produce normal sperm. However, polysomy can be transmissible through both the male and female parents through nondisjunction.|$|E

[...] It is very difficult to imagine that the Georgians launched their attack against U.S. wishes. The Georgians rely on the United States, and they were in no position to defy it. [...] the United States either was unaware of the existence of Russian forces, or knew of the Russian forces but -- along with the Georgians -- miscalculated Russia's intentions. [...] Putin did not want to re-establish the Soviet Union, but he did want to re-establish the Russian sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union region. [...] He did not want to confront NATO directly, but he did want to confront and defeat a power that was closely aligned with the United States, had U.S. support, aid and advisers and was widely seen as being under American protection. Georgia was the perfect choice. [...] The war in Georgia, therefore, is Russia's public return to great power status. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> that just happened — it has been unfolding ever since Putin took power, and with growing intensity in the past five years." ...|$|E

Judge Gray argued that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> the court <b>was</b> permitted to do without an express, written statute.
