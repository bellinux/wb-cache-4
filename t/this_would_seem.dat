5|$|There is {{no direct}} mention of Ivalice in Vagrant Story.

25|$|The above-average {{usage of}} water might be {{attributed}} {{to the demands of the}} baths, latrines and the possible Armamentarium, although industrial usage is more likely, since all forts would have baths and latrines. Large-scale smithing or smelting is assumed to have been carried out within the fort or the associated vicus judging by the large quantities of slag and cinders found at the site. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to support the thesis that this particular fort was home to an Armamentarium, or arms store, where weaponry was fabricated and stored. This would supply not only Longovicium but other nearby forts. However, the site is almost unique in Britain for the size of its water supply, and the remains imply large-scale iron smelting, perhaps assisted by watermills for forging iron products.|$|E
25|$|Reference {{has been}} made to the rib vault in Roman work, where the {{intersecting}} barrel vaults were not of the same diameter. Their construction must at all times have been somewhat difficult, but where the barrel vaulting was carried round over the choir aisle and was intersected (as in St Bartholomew-the-Great in Smithfield, London) by semicones instead of cylinders, it became worse and the groins more complicated. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to have led to a change of system and to the introduction of a new feature, which completely revolutionized the construction of the vault. Hitherto the intersecting features were geometrical surfaces, of which the diagonal groins were the intersections, elliptical in form, generally weak in construction and often twisting. The medieval builder reversed the process, and set up the diagonal ribs first, which were utilized as permanent centres, and on these he carried his vault or web, which henceforward took its shape from the ribs. Instead of the elliptical curve which was given by the intersection of two semicircular barrel vaults, or cylinders, he employed the semicircular arch for the diagonal ribs; this, however, raised the centre of the square bay vaulted above the level of the transverse arches and of the wall ribs, and thus gave the appearance of a dome to the vault, such as may be seen in the nave of Sant'Ambrogio, Florence. To meet this, at first the transverse and wall ribs were stilted, or the upper part of their arches was raised, as in the Abbaye-aux-Hommes at Caen, and the Abbey of Lessay, in Normandy. The problem was ultimately solved by the introduction of the pointed arch for the transverse and wall ribs - the pointed arch had long been known and employed, on account of its much greater strength and of the less thrust it exerted on the walls. When employed for the ribs of a vault, however narrow the span might be, by adopting a pointed arch, its summit could be made to range in height with the diagonal rib; and, moreover, when utilized for the ribs of the annular vault, as in the aisle round the apsidal termination of the choir, it was not necessary that the half ribs on the outer side should be in the same plane as those of the inner side; for when the opposite ribs met in the centre of the annular vault, the thrust was equally transmitted from one to the other, and being already a broken arch the change of its direction was not noticeable.|$|E

500|$|The horn, {{which was}} to feature {{prominently}} in 18th century compositions centred on dramatic themes of hunting or nobility, clearly symbolizes here the hunt, a recreation which was reserved for the wealthy and privileged. The virtuosic horn line (particularly difficult on the natural horn which {{did not have the}} valves available to the modern player) underlines this perspective. The aria has been claimed as a very early example of the horn's use in opera; its presence as a solo instrument would have been unexpected by audiences at the era of the premiere of Giulio Cesare. Handel began to feature the horn in his 1708 serenata Aci, Galatea e Polifemo, and first used the horn as part of an opera orchestra in Rinaldo (1711). The score of Giulio Cesare calls for four horns in the orchestra (although only one is used in this aria), and <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to be the first appearance in music of the 'horn quartet' which would become a standard feature of orchestral scores of the music of the romantic period a century later. The only other noted use by Handel of a horn obbligato in an aria occurs in his pastoral ode L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato (1740), where the text, [...] "Mirth, admit me", also refers to hunting.|$|E
500|$|Ballast Wiltshier plc, a {{contracting}} {{company that had}} built the Amsterdam Arena, was contracted to build the stadium at an initial cost of £15million. In June 1996, as the planned capacity rose to more than 40,000, construction work began. The capacity was revised again in early 1997, and the stadium was completed on time, with a capacity of 42,000. The stadium's design allows possible expansion of a further tier; completed expansion of the whole upper tier would produce a capacity of 63,000, although it is believed by some that the stadium can expand to a maximum capacity of 84,000, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> unlikely ever to be exercised. During construction, the stadium had not adopted an official name, and had been known colloquially as the [...] "Wearside Stadium" [...] and [...] "New Roker Park". The name was eventually revealed as the Stadium of Light, {{a reference to a}} miner's lamp (the stadium is built {{on the site of the}} old Wearmouth Colliery, and many Sunderland fans have worked in the region's mines). To emphasise the fact, a Davy lamp is located in front of the stadium's ticket office, adjacent to the stadium. The stadium was opened on 30 July 1997 by Prince Andrew, Duke of York, with bands such as U2, Status Quo, Upside Down and Kavana playing. To celebrate the opening of the stadium, Sunderland played a friendly against Dutch side Ajax, which was drawn 0–0.|$|E
500|$|Thelma {{is a film}} {{adaptation}} of the 1887 novel of the same name, it was written under the pen name Marie Corelli by Mary Mackay. During the era, her novels were so well-known that some reviewers {{did not need to}} include a summary of the plot of the film to reader. A brief review in The Moving Picture World {{went so far as to}} say, [...] "Practically everybody has read the novel, hence no long explanation is required." [...] Film historian Q. David Bowers, states, [...] "Although present-day scholars consider her works to be of no serious literary importance, she is remembered by the science-fiction world for her vivacious imagination and her [...] "scientific discoveries," [...] including interstellar travel via personal electricity. Her writings were known in her time for sublimated sex, fervent religiosity, and far-fetched fantasy." [...] The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. He was the most important script writer for Thanhouser, averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film assigns Theodore Marston as the director this film, but <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to be in error. The apparent origin of this error is from the American Film-Index 1908–1915. Bowers consulted one of the co-authors of the book, Gunnar Lundquist, and confirmed that the credit of Marston was in error. Theodore Marston worked with Pathé, Kinemacolor, Vitagraph and other companies, but there is no record of Marston working with Thanhouser. Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions.|$|E
