5|$|An initial demo of {{the game}} was made {{available}} in August 2007 for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. This demo included cutscenes to introduce the player to Rapture, the game's tutorial section, and its first levels; the demo also included weapons, plasmids, and tonics {{that would otherwise be}} introduced later in the full title, as to give the player more of <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>that</b> would be found in the published game. The Xbox demo was the fastest demo at that time to reach one million downloads on the Xbox Live service. The full game was released for these platforms on August 21, 2007.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the cathedral}} began in about 1175, {{to the design of}} an unknown architect. Wells is the first cathedral in England to be, from its foundation, built in the Gothic style. According to art {{historian}} John Harvey, it is the first truly Gothic cathedral in the world, its architects having entirely dispensed with all <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>that</b> bound the contemporary east end of Canterbury Cathedral and the earlier buildings of France, such as the east end of the Abbey of Saint Denis, to the Romanesque. Unlike these churches, Wells has clustered piers rather than columns and has a gallery of identical pointed arches rather than the typically Romanesque form of paired openings. The style, with its simple untraceried lancet arches and convoluted mouldings, is known as Early English Gothic.|$|E
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{produces}} basidiospores {{that are}} ellipsoidal or broadly ellipsoidal in shape. The spore shape {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>that</b> makes the species readily recognisable microscopically, and the spores measure from 4.5 to 6.1 by 3.5 to 5 micrometres(μm). The average spore length is 5.25μm, while the average width is 4.14μm. The spores have thick cell walls, and are hyaline. They are strongly cyanophilous, meaning that the cell walls will readily absorb methyl blue stain. In addition, they are weakly dextrinoid, meaning that they will stain slightly reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The spores are borne on barrel-shaped basidia, with four spores per basidium, measuring 8 to 12 by 6 to 7μm. There are also basidioles, which are similar in shape to the basidia, but slightly smaller.|$|E

30|$|Looking across estimators in Tables  7 and 8, {{the genetic}} {{matching}} estimates end up outliers in both cases: {{on the high}} side for women and on the low side for men.

For this reason, we tend to discount the estimates from the genetic matching estimator relative to the other three.|$|R

The Choquet-expected utility implied by such preference is used to capture <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> trader is uncertain about which model should be used. The prices that emerge from the model are similar to standard models and have <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> as uncertainty is removed, the derivative prices converge to standard prices. However, the optimal changes in the agent's portfolio that results from the option position are quite different than the standard hedge position. It is this <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> links uncertainty with market liquidity. ...|$|R
25|$|When {{generics}} {{were added}} to Java 5.0, there was already a large framework of classes (many of which were already deprecated), so generics were chosen to be implemented using erasure to allow for migration compatibility and re-use of these existing classes. This limited <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>that</b> {{could be provided by}} this addition as compared to some other languages. The addition of type wildcards made Java unsound.|$|E

The same forces also created the North American Great Lakes and the Niagara River. All were dug by a continental ice sheet that drove through the area, deepening some river channels to form lakes, and damming others with debris. Scientists argue {{there is an old}} valley, St David's Buried Gorge, buried by glacial drift, at the approximate location of the present Welland Canal.|$|E
25|$|Because the h-index {{was never}} meant to measure future {{publication}} success, recently, a group of researchers has investigated <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>that</b> are most predictive of future h-index. It is possible to try the predictions using an online tool. However, later work has shown that since h-index is a cumulative measure, it contains intrinsic auto-correlation that led to significant overestimation of its predictability. Thus, the true predictability of future h-index is much lower compared to what has been claimed before.|$|E

25|$|Gloster {{produced}} several design {{proposals in}} the hope of satisfying the requirement. P.228, drawn up in 1946, was essentially a two-seat Meteor with slightly swept wings. A similar design was also offered to the Royal Navy as the P.231. The later-issued P.234 and P.238 of early 1947 had adopted many of <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>that</b> would be distinctive of the Javelin, including the large delta wing and tailplane. The two differed primarily in role; P.234 was a single-seat day fighter with a V-tail, while P.238 was a two-seat night fighter with a mid-mounted delta tailplane.|$|E
25|$|A neuron is a {{specialized}} type of cell {{found in the}} bodies of all eumetozoans. Only sponges {{and a few other}} simpler animals lack neurons. <b>The</b> <b>features</b> <b>that</b> define a neuron are electrical excitability and the presence of synapses, which are complex membrane junctions that transmit signals to other cells. The body's neurons, plus the glial cells that give them structural and metabolic support, together constitute the nervous system. In vertebrates, the majority of neurons belong to the central nervous system, but some reside in peripheral ganglia, and many sensory neurons are situated in sensory organs such as the retina and cochlea.|$|E

25|$|Cuttlefish {{possess an}} {{internal}} structure called the cuttlebone, which is porous and {{is made of}} aragonite. The pores provide it with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the chambered cuttlebone via the ventral siphuncle. Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges or texture. The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, {{and is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>that</b> distinguish them from their squid relatives. Jewellers and silversmiths traditionally use cuttlebones as moulds for casting small objects, but they are probably better known as the tough material given to parakeets and other caged birds as a source of dietary calcium.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} issue of Huxley's Natural History Review, an article by George Rolleston on the {{orangutan}} brain showed <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>that</b> Owen claimed apes lacked, and when Owen responded {{in a letter to}} the Annals and Magazine of Natural History that the issue was a matter of definition rather than fact, Huxley made a public dissection of a spider monkey that had died at the zoo, to support his case. In the following issue John Marshall provided detailed measurements making the same point about the chimpanzee, as well as explaining how a chimpanzee's brain could be distorted by not being properly preserved and removed from the skull, so that it would look like the one in Owen's illustration.|$|E
25|$|LGE did not {{challenge}} {{the claim that}} the intended and reasonable use of the microprocessor products was to incorporate them into computers, but it claimed that some noninfringing uses existed: they could be sold overseas, as repair parts, or by disabling <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>that</b> made them patented. The Court dismissed these arguments. As for disablement, the Court asserted that the disabled device aspects (“features”) rather than the device that remained must have a noninfringing use, so that disabling them would cause them to have “no real use.” As for foreign or replacement use, the legal test to be looked to was whether the product would perform the patented method or embody the patented product, not whether the use gave rise to infringement liability.|$|E
