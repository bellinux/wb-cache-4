5|$|The {{station was}} rebuilt {{in the early}} 1930s <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> the {{relaying}} of the line west from Temple Meads with four tracks instead of two.

The two new island platforms opened on 21 May 1933, and the station name was changed to simply Parson Street in November 1933. The new station included covered waiting shelters, and a booking office on the road bridge. Again, no goods facilities were provided.|$|E

In bats, the relative alveolar surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume are significantly larger than most other small quadrupedal mammals. Due to the restraints of the mammalian lungs, bats cannot maintain high-altitude flight.|$|E

40|$|Four studies {{conducted}} in various organizations in Italy, employing contemporaneous and longitudinal designs, tested hypotheses relating 2 personality constructs - need for cognitive closure (Kruglanski & Webster, 1996) and locomotion tendency (Higgins, Kruglanski, & Pierro, 2003; Kruglanski et al., 2000) - to individuals' ability <b>to</b> successfully <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> organizational change. Across diverse organizational settings, populations studied, types of organizational change implemented, and measures of <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> change, we found that need for closure was negatively related, and locomotion tendency was positively related, <b>to</b> <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> change. We {{also found that the}} negative relation between need for closure and coping was attenuated where organizational climate is supportive of change, and that degree of successful <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> change determines post-change work attitudes. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing, Inc...|$|R
