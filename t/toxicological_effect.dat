50|$|Of 165 {{plant species}} found in Bermuda today, 14 are endemic (others are native), and 25 are endangered. When discovered, about 1505, the island's habitat was {{dominated}} by the remnant, old-growth forest of Bermuda Juniper (Juniperus bermudiana). Underwater archaeology of the caldera basin to the north shows that the area was once densely forested with junipers when it was above sea level. The juniper is an endemic species, though related to species found in North America. Its wood is an unusually deep red, indicative of the high iron content of the island's soil (which is similarly very red). Prior to human settlement, there were several million juniper trees in Bermuda. By the 1830s, large areas of Bermuda had been denuded by the shipbuilding industry. As that industry died out in the 19th century, however, the junipers rapidly recovered their numbers. By 1900, when the human population neared 20,000, the islands were again covered densely with juniper, although many of these were juvenile trees. The respite proved temporary, however. In the 1940s, it was realised that two species of scale insect, Lepidosaphes newsteadi and Carulaspis minima, had accidentally been introduced, and were rapidly killing off the junipers, which had no immunity to their <b>toxicological</b> <b>effect.</b> Attempts were made to control the infestation naturally, which involved the large-scale introduction of ladybird beetles (Coccinellidae), but these were to no avail. Over the next decade, roughly 8 million juniper trees were lost to the scales. Motor cars were legalised in Bermuda in 1948, {{as a result of}} changes wrought by World War II, and the resultant sprawl of the rapidly growing population (which had reached 60,000 by the 1980s) outward from the pre-war population centres happened simultaneously with the destruction of the forests. Unlike in the 19th century, many plant species that had been introduced, some, like the Casuarina, specifically to replace the windbreak lost with the juniper, spread virulently. The juniper grows slowly by comparison to many of the introduced species, and has been unable to thrive in the presence of Casuarina and Brazilian pepper trees. Efforts to restore it centre around intensively managed land areas, such as gardens and golf courses. Other large plant species, which were never as numerous as the juniper, had also fared poorly in the presence of invasive species, but have become popular with gardeners and their numbers also have increased in managed areas. These include two native species, the Bermuda olivewood (Elaeodendron laneanum), and the Bermuda palmetto (Sabal bermudana), the only native or endemic palm. In some coastal areas and inland marshes, Bermuda is the most northerly point at which mangrove trees are found. Smaller plants include many ferns. Notable among these is the rare Bermuda cave fern (Ctenitis sloanei). An even rarer fern, Diplazium laffanianum, no longer survives in the wild. Another native plant is the iris Bermudiana (Sisyrinchium bermudiana). This was thought to be endemic, but also appears in two locations in Ireland. Many of the smaller endemic and native plants of Bermuda are rare and endangered, but others have survived and prospered. The common Bermuda grass is not actually Bermudian, but a Mediterranean import.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{design of}} {{toxicological}} testing strategies aimed at identifying the toxic effects of chemicals without (or with a minimal) recourse to animal experimentation {{is an important}} issue for toxicological regulations and for industrial decision-making. This article describes an original approach which enables the design of substance-tailored testing strategies with a specified performance in terms of false-positive and false-negative rates. The outcome of toxicological testing is simulated in a different way than previously published articles on the topic. Indeed, toxicological outcomes are simulated not only {{as a function of the}} performance of toxicological tests but also as a function of the physico-chemical Properties of chemicals. The required inputs for Our approach are QSAR predictions for the LOAELs of the <b>toxicological</b> <b>effect</b> of interest and statistical distributions describing the relationship existing between in vivo LOAEL values and results from in vitro tests. Our methodology is able to correctly predict the performance of testing strategies designed to analyze the teratogenic effects of two chemicals: di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate and Indomethacin.

It can be foreseen that integrated testing strategies will evolve with the advent of AOPs and a better understanding of the mechanisms of <b>toxicological</b> <b>effects,</b> which comprise a combination of in silico and in vitro tools to predict <b>toxicological</b> <b>effects.</b> For example, models that predict pharmacokinetic behaviour (absorption, distribution) of compounds based on physicochemical properties could be combined with predictions of liver transport based on QSAR transporter models. The inclusion of subsequent results from in vitro toxicity assays with hepatocytes or mitochondria will help to identify compounds that have a propensity towards drug-induced liver toxicity (DILI). Such complementary tools may limit and remove the most problematic candidates in early phases or allow medicinal chemistry departments to optimize the structure early on.|$|R

Due to its <b>toxicological</b> <b>effects</b> this study reviews current literature on the toxicological profile of lead on the testis, bone, blood and lungs and the possible roles of mitigating agents. In this study reports showed that in the brain lead induced cerebellar edema, cerebral satellitosis and encephalomalacia with impairments in cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. Lead impairment of haematological parameters manifested as decrease in packed cell volume, haematoglobin, red blood cell count and total erythrocyte count. Anemia, leucopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia and monocytopenia were also reported. Lead treated testis was characterized by reduction in the weight of sex glands, testicular sperm counts, daily sperm production, sperm density, sperm viability, sex hormones with increase in sperm abnormalities. Histopathological study of lead treated testis revealed loss of germ cells with pyknotic nuclei and vacuolated cytoplasm. Apoptosis of sertoli cells, leydig cells and mitochondria degeneration were reported. Lead treated lungs were characterized by mononuclear cell proliferation, mononuclear cell invasion, collagen fibre accumulation in the interalveolar septa and pneumonia. The antioxidants status of these organs were impaired making these organs vulnerable to lead induced oxidative stress. This laid credence to the generation of reactive oxygen species as one of the mechanisms of lead induced <b>toxicological</b> <b>effects</b> in various organs. In this study it was also observed that the <b>toxicological</b> <b>effects</b> of lead were mitigated by vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, zinc and calcium.
