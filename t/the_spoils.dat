5|$|After leaving Heraclea, Attalus and Sulpicius sacked both Oreus, on the {{northern}} coast of Euboea, and Opus, the chief city of eastern Locris. <b>The</b> <b>spoils</b> from Oreus had been reserved for Sulpicius, who returned there, while Attalus stayed to collect <b>the</b> <b>spoils</b> from Opus. However, with their forces divided, Philip, alerted by signal fire, attacked and took Opus. Attalus, caught by surprise, was barely able to escape to his ships.|$|E

5|$|The {{civilian}} posse {{arrived at}} the battleground as the fighting finished.

40|$|The Heron Island harbour was re-dredged between September and November 1987 and a swing basin for {{vessels and}} a jetty were also {{constructed}} at that time. Following {{concern about the}} potential effects of the dredging operation, a multi-disciplinary monitoring program was initiated. This report covered {{the investigation into the}} nature and distribution of sediments on the reef flat and in <b>the</b> <b>spoil</b> dump, <b>the</b> conditions responsible for the erosion of <b>the</b> <b>spoil</b> dump and <b>the</b> quantity of dredge material in <b>the</b> <b>spoil</b> dump...|$|R
50|$|The Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Spoiling</b> Dyke (also {{known as}} the Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Spoiled</b> Dyke, Blar Milleadh a’ Ghàraidh, Millegearaidh) was a Scottish clan battle {{that took place in}} 1578, fought in the Scottish Highlands, between the MacDonalds of Uist and the Clan MacLeod.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{problems}} of acidification of some environmental components by acid mine drainage (AMD) are well-known {{all over the}} world, mainly in the regions with developed mining industry and in the regions with abandoned mines. AMD production and its consequences can be found also in <b>the</b> <b>spoil</b> dump of pyritized hydroquartzite in the locality of Malý Šobov in the Banská Štiavnica region (central Slovakia). This paper {{presents the results of}} two-year soil moisture research, its distribution, regime in the AMD production in this locality. The seasonal soil moisture variability in <b>the</b> <b>spoil</b> dump corresponds with the AMD production intensity (in spring and autumn <b>the</b> <b>spoil</b> dump moisture of about 20 % and temperature create suitable conditions for the activity of autochthonous microflora). The space distribution of soil moisture identified the permeable zones in <b>the</b> <b>spoil</b> dump (where <b>the</b> primary process of pyrite decomposition is expected) and impermeable zones where water and AMD are retained. This knowledge could be useful in application of other remediation processes into <b>the</b> <b>spoil</b> dump...|$|R
5|$|The manner {{by which}} Hopkins {{distributed}} <b>the</b> <b>spoils</b> was criticized, and {{his failure to}} follow his orders to patrol the Virginia shore resulted in censure by the Continental Congress.

Muhammad offered to free and marry her and according to some sources she accepted his proposal, while according to others she rejected it and remained Muhammad's slave. She is said to have later become a Muslim.|$|E

The machine also on the rails behind <b>the</b> <b>spoil</b> wagon is an early electrical coal cutter the arm extending from the front moved through an arc and cut a corresponding arc in the coal seam which then allowed the coal to drop down in big lumps. One the shaft was established the sinking engine would either be dismantled and sold on or kept to use in an emergency.|$|R

5|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Cleveland {{was faced with}} the task of filling all the {{government}} jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under <b>the</b> <b>spoils</b> system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone {{solely on the basis of}} party service. He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers. Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from <b>the</b> <b>spoils,</b> Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats.; this was especially the case with policy making positions. While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.|$|E
5|$|The Vandals {{were also}} {{weakened}} by the hostility of their Roman subjects, the continued existence among the Vandals of a faction loyal to Hilderic, and by the ambivalent position of the Moorish tribes, who watched the oncoming conflict from the sidelines, ready to join the victor and seize <b>the</b> <b>spoils.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{city was}} {{thoroughly}} sacked and plundered; {{according to the}} Arab accounts, the sale of <b>the</b> <b>spoils</b> went on for five days. The Byzantine chronicler Theophanes Continuatus mentions 70,000 dead, while the Arab al-Mas'udi records 30,000. The surviving population were divided as slaves among the army leaders, except for the city's military and civic leaders, who were reserved for the caliph's disposal. After allowing Theophilos's envoys to return to him with the news of Amorium's fall, Mu'tasim burned {{the city to the}} ground, with only the city walls surviving relatively intact. Among <b>the</b> <b>spoils</b> taken were the massive iron doors of the city, which al-Mu'tasim initially transported to Samarra, where they were installed at the entrance of his palace. From there they were taken, probably {{towards the end of the}} century, and installed at Raqqa, where they remained until 964, when the Hamdanid ruler Sayf al-Dawla had them removed and incorporated in the Bab al-Qinnasrin gate in his capital Aleppo.|$|E
5|$|Argentine {{football}} finally inscribed {{their name}} on the winner's list in 1964 when Independiente became the champions after disposing of reigning champions Santos and Uruguayan side Nacional in the finals. Independiente successfully defended the title in 1965; Peñarol would defeat River Plate in a playoff to win their third title, and Racing {{would go on to}} claim <b>the</b> <b>spoils</b> in 1967. One of the most important moments in the tournament's early history occurred in 1968 which saw Estudiantes participate for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Even with Lancaster defeated, {{the battle}} against the rebels was not over. Edmund was charged with {{overtaking}} Wallingford Castle from Maurice de Berkeley in January 1323, a task which he fulfilled with great success. For his loyalty, Edmund was rewarded with substantial holdings in Wales, primarily land forfeited by Roger Mortimer. The greater part of <b>the</b> <b>spoils</b> of war, however, went to the Despensers, who both benefited greatly from the forfeiture of the rebels. By 1326, the Despensers, father and son respectively, enjoyed incomes of £3,800 and £7,000, while Edmund's annual income was at only 2,355 marks (£1,570).|$|E

5|$|Grant and Hayes {{had both}} {{advocated}} civil service reform, and by 1881, civil service reform associations had organized with renewed energy across the nation. Garfield sympathized with them, believing that <b>the</b> <b>spoils</b> system damaged {{the presidency and}} distracted from more important concerns. Some reformers were disappointed that Garfield had advocated limited tenure only to minor office seekers and had given appointments to his old friends, but many remained loyal and supported Garfield.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{took office}} {{determined}} {{to reform the}} system of civil service appointments, which had been based on <b>the</b> <b>spoils</b> system since Andrew Jackson was president. Instead of giving federal jobs to political supporters, Hayes wished to award them by merit according to an examination that all applicants would take. Immediately, Hayes's call for reform brought him into conflict with the Stalwart, or pro-spoils, branch of the Republican party. Senators of both parties were accustomed to being consulted about political appointments and turned against Hayes. Foremost among his enemies was New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, who fought Hayes's reform efforts at every turn.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Eisenberg portrayed Rolling Stone {{journalist}} David Lipsky in the biographical drama film The End of the Tour, appearing opposite Jason Segel, who {{portrayed the}} late author David Foster Wallace. Eisenberg's third play, <b>The</b> <b>Spoils,</b> premiered off-Broadway in The New Group Perishing Square Signature Center Alice Griffin Box Theatre. The play featuring Eisenberg as Ben, also starring Kunal Nayyar, Michael Zegen, Erin Darke, and Annapurna Sriram, {{was the winner}} of The Blanche and Irving Laurie Foundation Theatre Visions Fund Award. On September 8, 2015, Eisenberg released his first book, Bream Gives Me Hiccups, {{a collection of short}} humor pieces.|$|E
50|$|Several {{techniques}} of re-utilising <b>the</b> <b>spoil</b> tips exist, usually including either geotechnics or recycling. Most commonly, old spoil tips are partially revegetated to provide valuable green spaces {{since they are}} inappropriate for building purposes. At Nœux-les-Mines, an artificial ski slope has been constructed on <b>the</b> tip. If <b>spoil</b> tips are considered to contain sufficient amounts of residual material, various methods are employed to remove <b>the</b> <b>spoil</b> from <b>the</b> site for subsequent processing.|$|R
