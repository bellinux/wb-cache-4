500|$|In Malaya, the RhAR {{comprised}} A, B, C and D Companies, each {{of which}} was split into three 32-man platoons. The white lieutenant commanding each platoon carried the weapon of his choice, usually a shotgun or an FN FAL battle rifle, and acted {{with the assistance of}} a black platoon sergeant and a black warrant officer. Under the lieutenant, three black corporals led a rifle section each. These consisted of the section leader (generally armed with a shotgun), a scout, a Bren gunner, a Patchett-Sterling machine-gunner, and up to seven FN FAL riflemen. When marching through thick jungle, an RhAR patrol moved in single file, with each trooper [...] behind <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front.</b> The warrant officer followed close behind the lieutenant, ready to take over command if necessary, with the radio operator and medic with him. The platoon sergeant made up the rear. According to Second Lieutenant John Essex-Clark, an Australian-born officer who led an RhAR platoon in Malaya, these Southern Rhodesian units moved much faster in jungle conditions than those made up of British men. The black Southern Rhodesian soldiers were reportedly naturals when it came to tracking; many of them came from rural backgrounds, and had acquired relevant instincts and skills while growing up.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{opens in}} a small South Texas bordertown in the 1850s. A poor farmer and his young son arrive into the {{settlement}} where the farmer confronts Luke, a thieving henchman employed by wealthy land baron Richard Barrett. The man complains to Luke {{that he had been}} cheated by Barrett claiming he had been sold a deed to non-existent property. Luke finally shoots the farmer, killing <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of his young son. His son then picks up his father's shotgun, uses it to kill Luke, and rides out of town with Luke's horse and a distinctive silver-trimmed saddle.|$|E
2500|$|A London Regiment private {{with the}} 60th (London) Division, [...] "pend {{a day of}} thirst, [...] he most {{depressing}} country conceivable ... not unlike the downs round Winchester but unrelieved dust colour, not a speck of green or a sign of habitation. Perfectly barren. Up hill and down dale and across Waddies we go. Clouds of dust inconceivable. So dense that you instinctively close on <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of you {{in order not to}} lose sight of him. Could not see your own feet, or where you were putting them down. That was the worst ... a man was just discernible at ten paces by peering. In the dust go camels, pack mules, limbers, wagons, artillery, and all the rattling paraphernalia of War." ...|$|E
60|$|Jack agreed, {{and they}} walked up to <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> just as <b>the</b> muleteer came {{galloping}} up with his troupe.|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later he saw <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> stop at <b>the</b> edge of the water, and he {{wondered}} why they did so. The channel was rapidly widening and they must cross at once or surrender. Instead, they ran along the bank for some distance and stopped again; and Andrew now saw that a white boat was moving along the opposite side. Changing his course, he ran on, panting hard, and saw that <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> were waiting. A moment later one plunged into the channel while his comrade stood still.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, fire a volley among <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of us," [...] Desmond said. [...] "We are {{not likely}} to hit any of them, but it is sure to draw their fire, and there will not be many unemptied guns as we pass them." ...|$|R
2500|$|Manfred von Richthofen later {{recalled}} that: [...] "I was animated {{by a single}} thought: <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of me must come down". He closed in to point blank range, opened fire, and [...] "suddenly the opponent's propeller turned no more. [...] Hit!" [...] It became evident that the plane lacked the speed to return to its own lines. [...] When it was forced down, von Richthofen landed his craft near the aircraft and documented his kill. This delayed {{his return to the}} Jasta headquarters and he explained the delay with [...] "One Englishman shot down". He later ordered a small silver cup from a Berlin jeweller to commemorate the victory. The inscription read: [...] "1. Vickers 2. 17.9.16". [...] This was the first of 60 such cups which von Richthofen ordered up until September 1917, at which time the jeweller declined further orders, since production was impossible due to a wartime silver shortage.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> was {{the deputy}} sheriff of the county; his {{companion}} was a stranger.|$|E
6000|$|There was a {{tremendous}} hullaboo about something, and I craned {{to see over the}} shoulder of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front.</b> [...] "Order, order, order!" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{some great}} {{demonstration}} was plainly toward; {{for the children}} of the forest were arrayed in two lines, right and left of the open space, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>front,</b> and <b>the</b> women behind; and all bedizened, {{to the best of their}} power, with arnotto, indigo, and feathers.|$|R
60|$|The yarn had not {{yet come}} to an end when a commotion among <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of us caused me to crane my neck to look in the {{direction}} many were pointing, and there I saw the lines of red marching directly toward us in perfect order, as if on parade.|$|R
50|$|The Kamayurá village {{comprises}} a round roof that {{is decorated}} with sape grass (Imperata brasiliensis) and the ‘house of the flutes’ contain important flute (jakui) instruments {{that can only be}} played by <b>the</b> <b>men.</b> <b>In</b> <b>front</b> of that house there is a meeting area where <b>the</b> <b>men</b> discuss fishing trips or plan festivals and so on.|$|R
60|$|Six picked Indians {{accompanied}} the prairie chief, and these marched in single file, each treading {{in the footsteps}} of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> with the utmost care.|$|E
60|$|At this command <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> {{rushed in}} and caught {{hold of the}} man's pin. Out it came in his hand, a {{beautiful}} affair, worth {{at least a hundred}} dollars.|$|E
6000|$|There {{is always}} unpleasantness about this tandem. It is {{the theory of}} <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> that the man behind does nothing; it is equally {{the theory of the}} man behind that he alone is the motive power, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> merely doing the puffing. The mystery will never be solved. It is {{annoying}} when Prudence is whispering to you on the one side not to overdo your strength and bring on heart disease; while Justice into the other ear is remarking, [...] "Why should you do it all? This isn't a cab. He's not your passenger:" [...] to hear him grunt out: ...|$|E

40|$|Photograph of a {{group of}} Yaqui Indians, {{including}} Chief Talaviate[?], at the surrender and signing of peace treaty at Ortiz, Mexico, ca. 1910. Three <b>men</b> stand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> foreground while other stand grouped behind them under a thatched canopy. They all wear hats. Two of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> wear scarves around their necks. The treaty was signed by Colonel Paynard and Chief Talaviate...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, no!" [...] said Kit. [...] "I expect I'll {{stop for}} a year or two. Anyhow, if I make much progress, I'll come back then. You see, I'm forced to go. There's no chance for me in Liverpool; you get old while you wait for <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> to move up the ladder. If I stop until I'm forty, I might get up a few rounds." ...|$|R
60|$|Without {{mentioning}} {{that he had}} some friends outside, Tony went in {{and sat down to}} talk with Cousin Maria. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the house had stepped to one side when the door opened, and the others were out of sight, of course.|$|E
6000|$|Esmond {{glanced at}} <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of him, {{with a little}} sardonic smile. [...] "I have only your assurance, and I'm afraid it would {{scarcely}} be wise to place more confidence in your friends than their leaders seem to have done. Their appearance is, unfortunately, against them." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{all this}} had taken {{valuable}} time, and meanwhile the other horses continued to gallop on, led by <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front,</b> {{who was now}} riding like the wind. Who he was they could not make out, but they strongly suspected Sol Blugg {{or one of his}} cronies.|$|E
60|$|Malcolm {{took his}} {{post at the}} {{loophole}} awaiting attack, but <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of him did not advance. Suddenly a light sprang up beneath him. There was a sound of falling stones, but the light grew brighter and brighter, {{and he knew that}} this time the pile had been fired. As he ran upstairs he was met by one of the soldiers from above.|$|R
60|$|And then, like a theatre trick, there {{followed}} the last act of Shoreby Battle. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Richard turned tail, {{like a dog}} that has been whistled home, and fled like the wind. At the same moment there came through the market-place a storm of horsemen, fleeing and pursuing, the Lancastrians turning back to strike with the sword, the Yorkists riding them down {{at the point of}} the lance.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> paused. Through <b>the</b> fumes {{of smoke}} they saw dimly {{the pile of}} barrels and a figure {{standing}} with a lighted torch close to one of them. A panic seized them, and believing they had {{made their way into}} a powder magazine, and that in another instant there would be a terrible explosion, they turned with shouts of [...] "A magazine! a magazine! Fly, or we are all dead men!" ...|$|R
60|$|The touring trip {{took the}} Crumville folks {{first to the}} {{business}} section of Chicago, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front,</b> with a megaphone, bawled out the various points of interest. Then the touring-cars, {{in a sort of}} procession, moved to a residential section, fronting Lake Michigan, with its palatial homes.|$|E
60|$|Stephen, who had {{in truth}} read {{the stories in}} {{question}} {{a month or two}} before, could not conceal his embarrassment He looked at <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of him,--alert, masterful intelligent, frank to any stranger who took his fancy,--and wondered how any one who had talked to him could believe them.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{not until}} an hour later that Harry heard a party {{ascending}} the stairs. When the door opened, he saw {{that two of the}} men carried torches. Abdool, who was in the rear, closed the door behind him, and then said, [...] "Now sahib!" [...] and struck down <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of him with his tulwar.|$|E
6000|$|The {{noise was}} too {{great for the}} words to be heard and, with cries of [...] "Death to the spy!" [...] <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> {{prepared}} for a rush. The leveled bayonets and drawn swords, however, for a moment checked their ardor; but those behind kept up the cry, and a serious conflict would have ensued, had not a party {{of five or six}} of the franc tireurs come along at the moment.|$|R
5000|$|Jeff Widener, {{took the}} famous picture of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{standing}} <b>in</b> <b>front</b> {{of a line}} of tanks during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the truth," [...] {{repeated}} Bradley. There was {{a strong}} Russell contingent in the meeting, and they were full of fight. <b>The</b> angry <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> repeated his shout: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> led the way. He {{was pale}} and cadaverous looking with scanty hair and {{drooping}} moustache: in shape he was very like a beetle, with limbs markedly bowed and held away from his stooping body. There were five of them altogether, three women and two men. Louisa was interested in them, vaguely wondering who they were.|$|E
60|$|Alton said nothing, but {{he pressed}} his heels home, and the big tired horse moved forward. The trail was narrow just there, and wound through a quaggy belt where tall wild cabbage grew out of black depths of mire. There was also no room for Hallam to wheel his horse on the {{slippery}} sawn-up logs, and Alton urged his beast on, glancing imperturbably at <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of him.|$|E
60|$|Just {{then the}} man they were {{discussing}} turned toward the bridge, from which the skipper was beckoning him. A minute or two later {{they went into the}} room beneath it, and the engineer sat down looking at <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of him with narrow, half-open eyes. The latter was young and spruce in trim uniform, a man of no great education, who had a favorable opinion of himself.|$|E

25|$|The term “rifle-musket” {{originally}} {{referred to}} muskets with the smooth-bored barrels replaced with rifled barrels. The {{length of the}} barrels were unchanged, allowing the weapons to be fired by rank, since a long rifle was necessary to enable the muzzles of the second rank of soldiers to project beyond the faces of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>front.</b> <b>The</b> weapon would also be sufficiently long when fitted with a bayonet to be effective against cavalry. Such weapons manufactured with rifled barrels, muzzle loading, single shot, and utilizing the same firing mechanism, also {{came to be called}} rifle-muskets.|$|R
60|$|A {{vigilant}} lookout was kept. Suddenly, {{when they}} were in the thickest part of the wood, a number of mounted men dashed out from either side. In obedience to the orders Ronald had given, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> and behind at once closed in, so that there were three {{on either side of the}} carriage. The assailants fired their pistols as they dashed down, but the bullets flew harmlessly by, while the fire of the defenders, sitting quietly on their horses, was more accurate, two of the assailants falling dead, while another was severely wounded.|$|R
