40|$|Background: Increased {{volume of}} <b>STAT</b> <b>test</b> and {{prolonged}} reporting time of laboratory results were causing concomitant {{delay in the}} diagnosis and management of patients in the emergency department also causing overcrowding and delay in patient care. Methods: Prospective study, conducted in the hematology section of clinical laboratory and emergency department satellite lab of The Aga Khan University Hospital. Satelitte aboratory was established in Emergency department, new staff was hired and trained, satellite lab was connected through ILMS {{to other areas of}} hospital. Data of previous 9 months i-e from January 2012 to October 2012 was taken into consideration. Results: During the study period, a total of 1166310 samples were received in Hematology section. Out of these samples, stat samples were 60108 (5. 1 % of total volume). STAT samples received in emergency department were 29039 (48. 3 % of total <b>stat</b> <b>test</b> received. Among these samples, CBC were 24701 (85 % of <b>STAT</b> <b>test)</b> and MP were 4338 (14. 9 %of <b>STAT</b> <b>test).</b> Results reported with in time with morphology were 28944 (99. 6 %) while the delayed results were (0. 32 %). CBC samples delayed were 0. 11 % while MP were 0. 21 %.

40|$|Processing {{time for}} tests is often {{considered}} the most significant measure of performance within a clinical lab. This paper summarizes a project completed by four undergraduate students during a semester-long Workstation Design course. The project setting was a clinical laboratory that was not consistently meeting time requirements for completion of <b>stat</b> <b>test</b> results. The goal, as specified by laboratory management, was to reduce the total turnaround time for <b>stat</b> <b>tests</b> and increase the percentage of tests meeting time requirements. Many industrial engineering methods were utilized including direct observation, process analysis, and historical data analysis. Improvement opportunities that were identified focus on reducing delays caused by poor visual cues and the unnecessary use of automation. These delays can be mitigated by color coding the carriers that incoming test specimens arrive in, manually processing certain stat specimen instead of using the automated machine available, and using colored labels for stat specimen {{in order to provide}} a visual cue for all technicians within the lab. The colored labels were implemented with positive feedback, while the other opportunities are still under consideration.

40|$|We {{are writing}} in {{response}} to the recent review entitled "Tumor Markers in the Detection of Recurrent TCC of the Bladder," by Aiman Zaher and Todd Sheridan (Acta Cytologica 2001; 45 : 575 - 581). Although valuable information is presented, the paper contains significant errors in the discussion of BTA that may result in misleading the reader. The authors erroneously state, "Antibodies to factor H were used initially to create the Bard BTA test... involving latex agglutination. " In fact, the first-generation test detected basement membrane proteins in urine and did not detect the presence of complement factor H-related proteins (CFHrp), an important distinction when comparing it to the improved tests. U. S. distribution of the original test was discontinued in 1995, and the authors correctly state that the BTA <b>stat</b> <b>test</b> (Alidex Inc., Redmond, Washington, U. S.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} {{study examines}} {{the aspects of}} psychological trauma and investigates why singular explanatory models fail compared with a holistic approach. Part of this integrated approach includes {{the development of a}} benchmarked psychometric test, the Sherry Trauma Assessment Test [STAT]) (Copyrighted © Richard Sherry 2011). The test’s reliability was evaluated using Chronbach’s alpha (p< 0. 001 levels of significance), which these findings were crosschecked with the findings from eleven other psychometric tests to standardise the results. In comparing the data sets, the <b>STAT</b> <b>test</b> project data was used to both answer fundamental questions within the field of clinical trauma psychology and confirm the reliability of the newly developed psychometric test. Furthermore, the information was collected and used to derive a principle component analysis (PCA) to help in developing a model to support current thinking within the social neuro-scientific arenas as well as to better organize clinical psychology assessment and treatment approaches. These findings have important implications on how trauma, in particular, the human neuropsychological learning process, is addressed. This psychometric foundation was then used to develop this newer model and adaptive tele-medicine platform (Zielinski et al., 2006). This multidisciplinary integration of information, expertise and models, has served to clarify the effects of maturation in relationship to traumatic response and helped to refine the understanding of how traumatic phenomena serves to fragment the integration of embedded systems, {{and what can be done}} to reverse these problematic processes in order to replace them with positive cycles of development. The <b>STAT</b> <b>test</b> findings have shown statistically significant results (p< 0. 001 level), which provide quantitatively grounded evidence in support of this psychometric measure and improve clinical assessment and treatment approaches. The theoretical model of the <b>STAT</b> <b>test</b> is included in the concept of Integrated Systems Healing, which was developed independently, but has similar theoretical roots in Goetz and Caron’s (2005) bio-psychosocial model of the Systemic Healing used in the treatment of sick children. The author describes further conceptual developments within the concept of Integrated Systems Healing (Copyrighted © Richard Sherry 2011) to include the holistic systems approach, which could be used for a large-scale treatment with specific interacting components of Integration, Compassion, Developmentally scaled interventions, and Sustainability or the ICDS Model (Copyrighted © Richard Sherry 2011). This project has evolved improved strategies for integrative assessment, feedback, and holistic approaches for learning and programme development to improve people’s lives.

50|$|Robert Sternberg, {{working with}} various colleagues, has also {{suggested}} that intelligence has dimensions independent of g. He argues {{that there are three}} classes of intelligence: analytic, practical, and creative. According to Sternberg, traditional psychometric tests measure only analytic intelligence, and should be augmented to test creative and practical intelligence as well. He has devised several tests to this effect. Sternberg equates analytic intelligence with academic intelligence, and contrasts it with practical intelligence, defined as an ability to deal with ill-defined real-life problems. Tacit intelligence is an important component of practical intelligence, consisting of knowledge that is not explicitly taught but is required in many real-life situations. Assessing creativity independent of intelligence tests has traditionally proved difficult, but Sternberg and colleagues have claimed to have created valid tests of creativity, too. The validation of Sternberg's theory requires that the three abilities tested are substantially uncorrelated and have independent predictive validity. Sternberg has conducted many experiments which he claims confirm the validity of his theory, but several researchers have disputed this conclusion. For example, in his reanalysis of a validation study of Sternberg's <b>STAT</b> <b>test,</b> Nathan Brody showed that the predictive validity of the <b>STAT,</b> a <b>test</b> of three allegedly independent abilities, was almost solely due to a single general factor underlying the tests, which Brody equated with the g factor.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{shipping}} activities {{developed in}} Ninh Hoa district (south-central Vietnam), have raised an urgent environmental concern {{related to the}} use of copper slag as abrasive material for removing rust {{from the surface of the}} ships. This study was conducted to investigate the characteristics of the blasted copper slag (BCS). Enrichment Factors (EF) were used to assess the contamination status of sediments and soils in the surroundings of the BCS dump site. The potential release of As and heavy metals (HMs) from BCS was examined through pH stat and cascade leaching tests in combination with XRD analysis. From the results, As, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn were characterized as moderate severely enriched to severely enriched while Cu showed extremely severe enrichment in the sediments. Regarding the soil collected at the dump site, it was strongly contaminated with As, Cu and Zn (extremely severe enrichment) whereas Cr, Ni and Pb were ranked as severely enriched. This study also demonstrates that it is important to use local background values of As and HMs in soils and sediments for a correct estimation of the degree of As or HM contamination. The cascade leaching test results from the BCS showed that the concentrations of the regulated HMs leached were lower than the EU limit for non-hazardous waste; except for Cu.

Materials and methods: 479 Chinese clinical laboratories participating in the external quality assessment programs of chemistry, blood gas, and haematology tests organized by the National Centre for Clinical Laboratories in China were included in our study. General information and the median of intra-TAT of routine and <b>stat</b> <b>tests</b> in last one week were asked in the questionnaires. Results: The response rate of clinical biochemistry, blood gas, and haematology testing were 36 % (479 / 1307), 38 % (228 / 598), and 36 % (449 / 1250), respectively. More than 50 % of laboratories indicated that they had set up intra-TAT median goals and almost 60 % of laboratories declared they had monitored intra-TAT generally for every analyte they performed. Among all analytes we investigated, the intra-TAT of haematology analytes was shorter than biochemistry while the intra-TAT of blood gas analytes was the shortest. There were significant differences between median intra-TAT on different days of the week for routine tests. However, there were no significant differences in median intra-TAT reported by accredited laboratories and non-accredited laboratories. Conclusions: Many laboratories in China are aware of intra-TAT control and are making effort to reach the target. There is still space for improvement. Accredited laboratories have better status on intra-TAT monitoring and target setting than the non-accredited, but there are no significant differences in median intra-TAT reported by them...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to determine, in {{addition}} to well-known prognostic factors, histological grade, stage, tumour size and multiplicity, the correlation of BTA stat Test on disease free interval (DFI) on primary superficial bladder cancer. A total of 116 patients with newly diagnosed bladder cancer were evaluated in a prospective multicentre study. A voided urine sample was obtained prior to TURB and split for culture, cytology and BTA <b>stat</b> <b>testing.</b> Follow-up data for the patients were collected until the first recurrence or the last visit and the DFI was analysed by Kaplan–Meier method and Cox analysis. Ninety-seven of the 116 (83. 6 %) patients were eligible for analysis. The BTA stat Test was positive in 73 (75. 3 %) patients, whereas cytology detected 20 (20. 6 %) cases. The DFI was found to be shorter among patients with a positive BTA stat Test, and also among those with intermediate or high-grade tumours. The BTA stat Test result divided patients with grade 2 tumours into two prognostic groups, in that those testing positive had 68. 6 % risk of recurrence during the first year compared to 42. 9 % risk of those with a negative test result (P = 0. 041). Although the effect of tumour size on DFI was notable, the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0. 064). Number of tumours was not related to DFI, nor was the difference between different stage of tumour of significance.

INTRODUCTION: Along with accuracy and reliability, timely reporting of laboratory test result is now considered an important aspect of service provided by a laboratory. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the cause of delay in TAT and scope for improvement. METHOD AND MATERIALS: This was a retrospective study from January 2011 to December 2012, where the TAT of <b>stat</b> <b>tests</b> were analysed. TAT was specified as the time from sample collection to final dispatch of report. The delay was categorized in to 0 - 30 min, 30 min- 1 hour, 1 - 2 hours, 2 - 5 hours, 5 - 10 hours and > 10 hours. Reasons and time of the day in which delay were looked into. RESULT: Total 102331 sample were received, out of which 6989 (6. 8 %) sample were reported out of range for acceptable TAT. Most delays (59. 29 %) were limited to the first 30 minutes. Most common delay was noted during lunch breaks and early mornings. Common source of delay was the pre-analytic phase (sample transport and pre-analytical processing). Significant improvement in TAT from year 2011 (8. 02 %) to 2012 (5. 4 %) was due increasing staff, regular audit and corrective actions.

40|$|Campylobacter {{enteritis}} is a food-borne or waterborne illness caused {{almost exclusively}} by Campylobacter jejuni and, {{to a lesser}} extent, by Campylobacter coli. These organisms produce indistinguishable clinical diseases and together represent {{the second most common}} cause of bacterial diarrhea in the United States and the leading cause of enteric infection throughout the world. The conventional approach to the laboratory diagnosis of Campylobacter enteritis is based on the recovery of the organism from a stool specimen, which requires the use of a specialized medium incubated at 42 °C for several days in an artificially created microaerophilic environment. Recently, several commercially available enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) have been developed for the direct detection of C. jejuni and C. coli in stool specimens. This study compared conventional culture with three EIA methods, the Premier CAMPY EIA (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH), the ProSpecT Campylobacter EIA (Remel, Lenexa, KS), and the ImmunoCard <b>STAT!</b> CAMPY <b>test</b> (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH), for the detection of C. jejuni and C. coli in 485 patient stool samples. Discordant results were arbitrated by using an in-house, real-time PCR assay that was developed and validated by a public health reference laboratory. Following analyses of the discrepant specimens by PCR, the sensitivity and specificity of both the Premier CAMPY and ProSpecT Campylobacter EIAs were 99. 3 % and 98 %, respectively, while the ImmunoCard <b>STAT!</b> CAMPY <b>test</b> had a sensitivity of 98. 5 % and a specificity of 98. 2 %. By use of the PCR test as the reference standard, culture detected 127 of 135 Campylobacter-positive stool specimens, yielding a sensitivity of 94. 1 %. These results showed that the three EIAs evaluated in this study provide a rapid and reliable alternative for the laboratory diagnosis of enteric infections with C. jejuni and C. coli and that conventional culture may no longer be recognized as the “gold standard” for diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|We {{review the}} status of radioimmunoassays for {{detection}} of abused drugs. Individual assays with use of 1251 -Iabeled antigens are all performed in an identical manner and can be completed in 30 mm to 1 h. Combined assays for si-muitaneous detection {{of two or more}} such drugs or assays in which a tritium-labeled antigen is used require 1 - 2 h for completion. All tests can be performed with 0. 1 ml or less of specimen. The assays involving 1251 reliably detect urinary concentrations of, per liter, 40 - 100 g of mor-phine, 100 g of barbiturates, methadone, methaqualone, or benzoylecgonine, and 1000 tg of amphetamine. The assay for morphine involving 3 H detects 60 tg/liter. Each assay is capable of providing a qualitative and quantitative estimate of the drugs sought. The 125 i-labeled antigens have a usable shelf life of at least two to four months after the antigen is iodinated; the tritium assay is stable for six months. The assays can be performed with use of paper discs that have been suspended in urine and then dried, in place of the liquid specimen. The assays appear to be equally applicable to detection of drugs in urine, blood, saliva, and tissues. All of them are done at ambient tem-perature and can be used equally well for emergency (<b>stat)</b> <b>tests</b> or mass screening.

40|$|Aim: Brucellosis is {{a disease}} of {{zoonotic}} importance as it affects both human as well as animal’s health, and therefore, directly affects animal productivity and human efficiency. Therefore, a {{study was conducted to}} estimate the seroprevalence of brucellosis in humans in Jammu and surrounding areas. Materials and Methods: A total of 121 sera samples from humans occupied with professional related to animals were collected and tested for anti-Brucella antibodies by Rose Bengal plate test (RBPT), modified RBPT (mRBPT), standard tube agglutination <b>test</b> (<b>STAT),</b> and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (I-ELISA). Sampling was done keeping in view with the occupation, sex, and age. Results: The overall seroprevalence of brucellosis recorded was 4. 96...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea is to}} {{advocate}} {{the use of the}} condi-tional distribution of the goodness-of-fit test given the value of Tn (min. suff. <b>stat.).</b> This, in <b>testing</b> fit of a distribution in presence of unknown θ and since not of interest, it is con-sidered nuisance so conditioning seems appro-priate. Emphasis in no need for tables but rather for an algorithm based on simulation which produces “exact ” conditional p-value. So it is an exact level α, finite-n procedure, in the continuous case. It may be used in the discrete case as well but the level would be approximate due to dis-creteness of Tn. Inverse Gaussian is discussed, comparing the results of the procedure with recent power stud-ies, showing that for the alternatives consid-ered, there is an increase of power. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} based on the {{investigation}} of Pb, Cd, Ca, and Cl in one individual batch of bottom ash and fly ash (mixture 5 : 1) resulting from a specific municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) in Japan. This mixture ash was stabilized as the following pretreatments: water washing, carbonation, and phosphate stabilization. After the optimum processing condition for each pretreatment was determined, the performance of each pretreatment was examined using pH <b>stat</b> leaching <b>tests</b> (pH 6, 9, 12) and availability tests. For the performance tests, fly ash alone was used, instead of a mixture of MSWI residues, to observe leaching differences among the pretreatments more distinctly. Water washing effectively removed the major elements from MSWI residues and also reduced the leachability of trace metals, such as Pb and Cd, from MSWI residues. A washing time of 15 min with an L/S ratio of 5 was reasonably effective. Carbonation had a significant effect on leachability in alkaline ranges (pH 9 and 12), due to carbonation only on the surface of MSWI residues, not in the center matrix. A moisture content of 10 - 16. 7 % appeared to be suitable for carbonation. Phosphate stabilization, even with small doses of phosphate (0. 16 mol-PO 4 ^ 3 - kg^- 1 sample), was very effective at reducing the leachability of heavy metals...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHere, {{we define}} the IL- 7 R-activated signal that {{promotes}} survival and proliferation of T cell progenitors and demonstrate {{that it is}} distinct from the signals that induce differentiation. We show that IL- 7 activates PKB and STAT 5 in human thymocytes. Into T cell precursors we introduced chimeric receptors with a cytoplasmic domain of the IL- 7 R {{that is no longer}} able to activate PI- 3 K/PKB and <b>STAT</b> 5 and <b>tested</b> the transduced cells in a fetal thymic organ culture. We also examined the T cell precursor activity of progenitors expressing dominant-negative forms of PI- 3 K or STAT 5 B. These experiments revealed that PI- 3 K/PKB activation is essential for the survival and proliferation of T cell precursors and suggest that STAT 5 activated by IL- 7 mediates T cell differentiation...|$|R
