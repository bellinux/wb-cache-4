The OSE estimates the external loads using the response of the model and calculated <b>natural</b> <b>modes.</b> The response is measured with several accelerometers to allowthe OSE to estimate the response of the flexible modes which is needed for an accurate estimation of the external forces.

40|$|Relatively simple {{analytical}} {{procedures for the}} estimation of natural frequencies of free thin rectangular plates, based on the Rayleigh quotient and the Rayleigh-Ritz method, are presented. First, <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> are assumed in the usual form as products of beam <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> in the longitudinal and transverse directions, satisfying the grillage boundary conditions. Based on a detailed FEM analysis, the missing of some <b>natural</b> <b>modes,</b> defined as a sum and a difference of the cross products of beam modes, is noted. The frequencies of these modes are very similar and identical in some special cases, manifesting {{in such a way}} a double frequency phenomenon. These families of <b>natural</b> <b>mode</b> shapes form a complete natural frequency spectrum of a free rectangular plate as a novelty. The reliable approximation of <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> enables the application of the Rayleigh quotient for the estimation of higher natural frequencies. The application of the developed procedure is illustrated by the case of a free thin square plate. The obtained results are compared with those determined by FEM and also with rigorous ones from the relevant literature based on the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The achieved accuracy is acceptable from the engineering point of view. Furthermore, the same problem is solved by the Rayleigh-Ritz method using approximate <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> as mathematical ones. Direct and iterative procedures are presented. A small number of mathematical modes and iteration steps are sufficient to achieve reliable results...|$|R

40|$|In {{magnetic}} singularity identification (MSI) of coonducting and permeable scatterers {{one considers}} the low-frequency poles with real <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> and frequencies to represent the magnetic-polarizability dyadic. This is an approximation neglecting the higher-order multipoles. This paper considers the magnetic quadrupole terms as a correction to the dipole-only representation. This leads {{to the concept of}} the effective center of a <b>natural</b> <b>mode</b> to minimize the quadrupole contribution. In the case of scatterers with certain symmetries there can also exist <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> with no magnetic-dipole contribution, but with a quadrupole contribution.

40|$|Acoustic {{noise in}} the {{switched}} reluctance motor (SRM) is caused primarily by the deformation of the stator lamination stack. Acoustic noise is most severe when the periodic excitation of the SRM phases excites a <b>natural</b> vibration <b>mode</b> of the stack. The <b>natural</b> vibration <b>modes</b> and frequencies of a four-phase, 8 / 6 SRM are examined. Structural finite element analysis is used to compute the <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> and frequencies. Impulse tests on the stator stack verify the calculations and show which modes are excited. Heuristic arguments are developed to predict the operating conditions that will excite the <b>natural</b> <b>modes.</b> Measurement of vibration while the machine is under load shows which operating conditions excite the <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> and verifies the predictions. An approximate formula is derived to predict {{the frequency of the}} fundamental vibration mode in terms of lamination dimensions and material properties. The formula is validated by comparison with finite element calculations for several laminations, and hence is shown to be useful in design trade-off studies...|$|R

40|$|An {{approach}} for identifying {{the dynamics of}} large space structures is applied to a free-free beam. In this approach the system's order is determined on-line, along with mode shapes, using recursive lattice filters which provide a least square estimate of the measurement data. The mode shapes determined are orthonormal {{in the space of}} the measurements and, hence, are not the <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> of the structure. To determine the <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> of the structure, a method based on the fast Fourier transform is used on the outputs of the lattice filter.

40|$|Thermoacoustic instabilities usually {{result from}} the {{coupling}} between the oscillatory heat release and one or more <b>natural</b> acoustic <b>modes</b> of the combustion system. When the shifting of system frequencies caused by the unsteady heat release is limited, the calculation of <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> allows to identify which of them are excited by the flame once changes in flow temperature and composition due to combustion are considered. In this paper, isothermal computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed to predict the <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> of a heavy-duty gas turbine combustor in reactive conditions. Combustion and heat transfer are neglected in the numerical analysis to simplify the model and limit the computational effort. The natural frequencies resulting from isothermal simulations are then corrected using a rather basic post processing approach to account for temperature and gas composition changes due to combustion process. Frequency and amplitude of the calculated modes are finally compared to experimental measurements to evaluate {{the ability of the}} acoustic analysis to capture frequency and spatial shape of the combustor <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> excited by the flame...|$|R

A vide range of side ratios and Poisson's ratios are considered {{and the results are}} presented in the form of tables and graphs. The solutions for plates with two opposite edges simply supported are obtained by employing Levy's Method and those for plates having two opposite edges not simply supported are obtained by employing Rayleigh-Ritz, procedure using the <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> of vibrating beams as approximating deflection functions of the plates. The first six <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> of clapped-clamped and free-free beams and the first five <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> of clamped-free beams were used in the analysis.

By using the finite element method (FEM) software, the Eigen vibration of 3 -D finite element model of maxillary central incisor tooth was analyzed.

When a <b>natural</b> <b>mode</b> of an elastic target is excited, the energy which is stored during the forced excitation is radiated {{after the end of}} the forced excitation. The observation of backscattered spectra obtained by the "Resonance Isolation and Identification Method" (RIIM) fi •om an aluminium cylinder shows supplementary resonances. The directivity pattern of the transducer is the cause of these supplementary resonances. The behaviour of these resonances is analogous to the resonances of plates. This leads us to study the <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> of the cylinder. Ail the resonances which are experimentally detected may be considered as normal modes of the target.

The deflection of loop part and the bending of leg part generated by piezoelectric bimorphs makes an elliptic motion at the center point of the upper member. If resonators are put in a train and are actuated at the same frequency, it can feed objects on the upper surface of its train. There are two type of resonator, arch type and pentagonal type. Arch type resonator generates big amplitude {{on the center of}} upper surface. Bending its under member, pentagonal type resonator generates amplitude on the whole upper surface. Calculated results show that a shape of resonator influences on <b>natural</b> <b>modes</b> and <b>natural</b> frequencies. The trial one could generate elliptic motion in arbitrary phase with both type resonator.

40|$|A new method, namely Impact-synchronous Modal Analysis (ISMA), {{utilizing}} the modal extraction technique {{commonly used in}} Experimental Modal Analysis performed {{in the presence of}} the ambient forces, is proposed. In ISMA, the extraction is performed while the machine is running, utilized Impact-synchronous Time Averaging prior to performing the Fast Fourier Transform. The number of averages had a very important effect when applying ISMA on structures with dominant periodic responses of cyclic loads and ambient excitation. With a sufficient number of impacts, all the unaccounted forces were diminished, leaving only the response due to the impacts. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of averages taken in the determination of dynamic characteristics of a machine while in different rotating speeds. At low operating speeds that coincided with the lower <b>natural</b> <b>modes,</b> ISMA with a high number of impacts determined the dynamic characteristics of the system successfully. Meanwhile, at operating speeds that were away from any <b>natural</b> <b>modes,</b> ISMA with a moderate number of averages taken was sufficient to extract the modal parameters.
