40|$|In daily speech the {{linguistic}} information {{plays a major}} role in the communication between people. However, voice quality and individuality are important in speech recognition and understanding. For instance, it is exceptionally significant to understand and discriminate between two or more speakers in a radio or a television program. Voice individuality, apart from providing the aforementioned advantages in communication, enriches our daily life with variety. For a number of modern applications it is important to create and maintain data bases for different speakers, for example, in gaming, in text-to-speech synthesis and in cartoon movies. This may be time consuming and expensive, depending on the requirements of the application. Speaker interpolation (SI) is the process of producing an intermediate voice between two or more speakers, while voice conversion (VC) is the technique of processing the voice of one person, namely the source speaker, such that his/her voice resembles the voice of another person, namely the target speaker. Moreover, the converted or interpolated speech should sound natural and intelligible. Despite the extended research in VC, high-quality voice conversion has not been achieved yeet. A number of reasons explain this current shortcoming, with the main ones being a) the oversmoothing effect by using of statistical modeling b) inaccurate estimation of the speaker-depended features and c) the inadequacy of the used synthesis methods. Voice conversion methods are based on spectral envelope information, which represents the vocal tract, since it has an important role on speech individuality. In conventional VC the excitation signal of the source speaker is ex- tracted first by inverse filtering. Then this excitation signal is filtered from the vocal tract of the target speaker. In <b>speech</b> <b>interpolation</b> the excitation signal is filtered from an interpolated vocal tract of the given speakers. The scope of this thesis is to deal with this research gap and achieve high quality <b>speech</b> <b>interpolation</b> and voice conversion of parallel corpora using accurate meth- ods for spectral envelope estimation (true envelope), time and frequency alignment (piecewise linear time and frequency warping), and speech synthesis (interpolated lattice filter or overlap and add). With the use of precise methods in each processing step it was expected to reduce the artifacts currently met in voice conversion. In <b>speech</b> <b>interpolation</b> the produced vocal tract is not just an interpolation between the given speakers, but the vocal tract length can be altered, producing a broad range of voices. Hence, given a limited data base a substantially larger one that contains individual speakers for every use can be created...|$|R

Usually a fixed amount of time is given to scan individual bands. Most of the times, historical information about the traffic in the spectrum bands is not used.

Therefore, instead of scanning a band for a fixed amount of time, more time can be given to less occupied bands and less time to heavily occupied ones.

50|$|The {{telephone}} switching in the ISCs was then typically crossbar or electronic controlled cross-points such as reed relays. The transmission media {{was likely to}} be satellite or lengthy terrestrial submarine cable channels. In some cases these were advantaged or multiplied with TASI (Time-Assignment <b>Speech</b> <b>Interpolation)</b> or DCME (Digital Circuit Multiplication Equipment). These transmission methods were not suited to Line or Inter-Register signalling. Taking the signalling function away from the traffic channel could cut costs, and would later lead to Common Channel Signalling. There would be no need for filtering signalling away from speech, and the duty cycle of the costly trunk for each revenue earning call would be better. Signalling time in call set up and clear down would be significantly shorter than with C4 and C5. With telephone signalling not transmitted over the line, the opportunities for fraud were reduced.|$|R
50|$|TAT-1 (Transatlantic No. 1) was {{the first}} transatlantic {{telephone}} cable system. It was laid between Gallanach Bay, near Oban, Scotland and Clarenville, Newfoundland between 1955 and 1956 by the cable ship Monarch. It was inaugurated on September 25, 1956, initially carrying 36 telephone channels. In the first 24 hours of public service there were 588 London-U.S. calls and 119 from London to Canada. The capacity of the cable was soon increased to 48 channels. Later, an additional three channels were added by use of C Carrier equipment. Time-assignment <b>speech</b> <b>interpolation</b> (TASI) was implemented on the TAT-1 cable in June 1960 and effectively increased the cable's capacity from 37 (out of 51 available channels) to 72 speech circuits.

40|$|In {{this work}} some {{modifications}} to the evaluation of PRMA protocols are presented. First, a more realistic voice model which takes in account the hangover of the speech detector is used, based on ITU-T P- 84 recommendation. Second, the Front End Clipping (FEC) is calculated and taken as a limiting parameter instead of the dropping probability. Unlike this last, the FEC is a standard parameter to measure the quality of <b>speech</b> <b>interpolation</b> voice systems. The main conclusion is that even taking the most relaxed FEC condition, this factor is more restrictive than fixing the dropping probability {{to a maximum of}} 1 %. 1. INTRODUCTION In the recent years, some papers have been published about the performance evaluation of the protocol PRMA [1, 2] considering different situations like erroneous channels [3], fading [4] or the capture effect.

30|$|Finally, {{numerical}} {{results are}} provided {{to demonstrate the}} accuracy of the analytical results and the effectiveness of the proposed ALPF method. It is shown that, PSDFR outperforms TSDFR to achieve higher achievable rate in such a MIMO–OFDM relaying system. Moreover, some important conclusions are obtained: The optimal factor which indicates the time division pattern between the two phases in the PSDFR protocol is always above 0.8, which means that, the common division of the total transmission time into two equal phases in previous work applying PS-based receiver is not optimal. It is also shown that the relay position greatly affects the system performance of both protocols, and relatively worse achievable rates are achieved when the relay is placed {{in the middle of the}} source and the destination. This is different from the MIMO–OFDM DF relaying system without SWIPT. Besides, we find some differences between AF and DF systems. For example, in the AF system of Reference (Xiong et al. 2015), as the relay node moves from the source to the destination, the optimal <b>time</b> <b>assignment</b> factor in TS-based protocol will decrease to achieve higher system performance. But in DF systems, as the relay node moves from the source to the destination, the optimal <b>time</b> <b>assignment</b> factor first increases and then decreases, which is to say that, when the relay is in the middle of the source and the destination, the optimal <b>time</b> <b>assignment</b> factor is relatively high.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is the development of}} resource management schemes for integrated networks, with the major contributions being: (i) the development of an optimal adaptive buffer management scheme for the packet-switched subsystem, (ii) the integration of a moveable-boundary hybrid switching scheme with the time assigned <b>speech</b> <b>interpolation</b> technique for implementing a congestion control mechanism for the packet-switched subsystem, and (iii) the development of an adaptive hierarchical scheme for implementing the access control and routing functions within the circuit-switched subsystem. The problem of buffer management at an integrated network node is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem with a convex objective function and an interative solution technique with fast convergence is proposed for a real-time implementation of the buffer management scheme in practical environments. In order to exercise an additional degree of control over the packet-blocking probability at each hybrid-switched link within the network, a new multiplexing scheme based on the integration of the moveable-boundary hybrid switching scheme and the time assigned <b>speech</b> <b>interpolation</b> technique is presented in this dissertation. The tradeoff between the corresponding decrease in the packet blocking probability and the increase in the circuit freezeout fraction is demonstrated by a detailed queueing analysis of the multiplexer. Specific algorithms are also presented in this dissertation for the solution of the access control and routing problems within the circuit-switched subsystem. In particular, an access control scheme is developed by solving an integer programming problem formulated using the policy of complete partitioning of the available bandwidth among the competing user classes. As an alternative to the completely partitioned approach, the problem of traffic routing is considered in a network that supports homogeneous traffic classes based on the policy of complete sharing. Finally, for the general case of networks with heterogeneous traffic classes, a hierarchical scheme is developed for the implementation of the access control and the routing functions at two functional levels, where the access control is implemented by the network supervisor who solves an appropriate linear integer programming problem periodically, and the routing function is handled by the individual nodes of the network on a distributed basis.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a wireless powered communication network (WPCN) with group cooperation, where two communication groups cooperate {{with each other}} via wireless power transfer and time sharing to fulfill their expected information delivering and achieve "win-win" collaboration. To explore the system performance limits, we formulate optimization problems to respectively maximize the weighted sum-rate and minimize the total consumed power. The <b>time</b> <b>assignment,</b> beamforming vector and power allocation are jointly optimized under available power and quality of service requirement constraints of both groups. For the WSR-maximization, both fixed and flexible power scenarios are investigated. As all problems are non-convex and have no known solution methods, we solve them by using proper variable substitutions and the semi-definite relaxation. We theoretically prove that our proposed solution method guarantees the global optimum for each problem. Numerical results are presented to show the system performance behaviors, which provide some useful insights for future WPCN design. It shows that in such a group cooperation-aware WPCN, optimal <b>time</b> <b>assignment</b> has the greatest effect on the system performance than other factors.
