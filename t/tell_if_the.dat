25|$|The Department of Defense {{returned}} the dead men's bodies {{to their families}} in mid-June, after al-Utaybi's family openly questioned the claims he'd committed suicide and requested his body for a second autopsy. Utaybi's family reported that the Saudi post-mortem had found that the DOD had retained his brain, heart, liver and kidneys. Each of the families had second autopsies done, but these were inconclusive. In each case, the US had kept organs of the throat, so pathology teams could not <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> men had died by hanging or not.|$|E
25|$|The {{minutes of}} the old lodge at York, which later called itself the Grand Lodge of All England, give a glimpse of masonry outside the Grand Lodges of the period. The minutes are erratic, with spaces of some years between some entries. It is often {{impossible}} to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> minutes are lost, were never taken, or the lodge did not meet at all. They do, however, contain {{the full text of}} a speech by the antiquary Francis Drake in 1726, in which he discusses the contemplation of geometry, and the instructive lectures which ought to be occurring in lodges. He used the York legend to claim precedence of his own lodge over all others in England, and being a more careful historian than the compilers of the Old Charges, Edwin the son of Athelstan became Edwin of Northumbria, adding three centuries to his lodge's pedigree. Later minutes show the lodge adding ritual, and developing a five degree system from a single ceremony where a candidate was admitted and made a Fellow Craft in one evening. The York account of the split between the Premier Grand Lodge of England and the Lodge of Antiquity provides a balance to the charged prose of William Preston. The minutes cease for the final time in 1792.|$|E

Andrew Bub of GameSpy asserted that Nintendo should have used Iridion to advertise the Game Boy Advance, {{as it took}} {{full advantage of the}} system's power. A year after its release, TechTV's Miguel Concepcion argued it was still the best-looking game for the system. Miguel Lopez of GameSpot lauded the graphics, writing that [...] "while it's ultimately all smoke and mirrors, Iridions world is richly detailed, has remarkable depth, and is unbelievably fluid.

500|$|The stagecoach {{made its}} way through the crowded square at about 10:30am. Kupriashvili gave the signal, and the robbers hit the {{carriage}} with grenades, killing many of the horses and guards, and began shooting security men guarding the stagecoach and the square. Bombs were thrown from all directions. The Georgian newspaper Isari reported: [...] "No one could <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> terrible shooting was the boom of cannons or explosion of bombs... The sound caused panic everywhere... almost across the whole city, people started running. Carriages and carts were galloping away". [...] The blasts were so strong that they knocked over nearby chimneys and broke every pane of glass for a mile around. Ekaterina Svanidze, Stalin's wife, was standing on a balcony at their home near the square with her family and young child. When they heard the explosions, they rushed back into the house terrified.|$|E

[...] This advertising premise was substantiated by Virgil Exner's designs, notably the 1947 Studebaker Starlight coupé, which introduced innovative styling features that influenced later cars, including the flatback [...] "trunk" [...] instead of the tapered look of the time, and a wrap-around rear window. Exner's concepts were spread through a line of models like the 1950 Studebaker Champion Starlight coupe The new trunk design prompted a running joke that one could not <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> car was coming or going.|$|E

2500|$|In 1959, Wann Langston, Jr. {{recorded}} {{evidence of}} a Centrosaurus bonebed near Hilda, Alberta. Later, between 1964 and 1966 Don Taylor of the Provincial Museum of Alberta (now called the Royal Alberta Museum) oversaw the collection of fossils from yet another bonebed in the same region. These prospective bonebeds {{attracted the attention of}} scientists working for the Royal Tyrell Museum in the 1990s because Hilda was an ideal location for maintaining physical continuity across the bonebeds' expanse. Physical continuity is important, because discontinuity in the rock strata can make it harder to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> bones were deposited at the same time or not.|$|E
2500|$|This {{mechanism}} {{agrees with}} the observations involving return paths: an EMF is generated whenever the disc moves relative to the return path, regardless of {{the rotation of the}} magnet. In fact it was shown that so long as a current loop is used to measure induced EMFs from the motion of the disk and magnet {{it is not possible to}} <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> magnetic field does or does not rotate with the magnet. (This depends on the definition, the motion of a field can be only defined effectively/relatively. If you hold the view that the field flux is a physical entity, it does rotate or depends on how it is generated. But this does not alter what is used in the Lorentz formula, especially the v, the velocity of the charge carrier relative to the frame where measurement takes place and field strength varies according to relativity at any spacetime point.) ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{several weeks}} after 15 September, the Germans were puzzled about the new weapon, being unable to {{distinguish}} between accurate reports of their shape and size and the more fanciful accounts. The existence {{of male and female}} tanks apparently led Germans to believe that there were a mass of specialist vehicles and sight of a knocked-out tank north of Flers, caused an officer to conclude that it had a single, wide caterpillar track, which caused much confusion to military intelligence. On 28 September, an intelligence officer included the report along with an accurate description and that much was still uncertain about how the vehicles were built, how many types there were or how big. Bavarian gunners taken prisoner reported that the tanks were a surprise and that the [...] "Spitzgeschoss mit Kern" [...] ( [...] S.m.K. pointed projectile with core) bullets issued earlier had not been intended for anti-tank fire. The tanks that did confront German and Bavarian troops caused panic and prisoners said that it was not war but butchery. Later in the month, a German intelligence officer wrote that only time would <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> new weapon was of any value.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are some}} fairly {{widespread}} {{questions as to}} whether or not the speaker may have a homosexual love interest in his friend the young man. This idea is hard to prove one way or the other but has been acknowledged by many writers and scholars such as Professor Robert Matz from George Mason University. It is difficult to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> speaker has a genuine respect and admiration for his friend or if there is more to it than that. However, this debate always comes down to personal opinions and it is up to the reader to decide what they would like to believe. [...] Shakespeare uses many descriptions in this sonnet that are interpreted as sexual references. Renowned Shakespeare critic Joseph Pequigney writes in his book Such is my Love that line 10, [...] "makes the most open reference to auto-eroticism. Being infecund, it involves both the expenditure of seed for self-gratification and withholding it from reproduction". As Pequigney explains, in this sonnet not only is the speaker trying to convince his friend the young man to have children, but he is making an argument against masturbation, which is something the speaker sees as selfish and a waste of the young man's great genetics. This line also contributes to the reason why this sonnet has been called [...] "A Disquisition Forbidding Masturbation" [...] by Joseph Pequigney. This subject of masturbation goes hand in hand with the idea of being alone and dying without producing children or heirs, something which the speaker thinks would be a selfish act and would deprive the future earth of beauty.|$|E
