Sloughing is normally used <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> card that may otherwise take a trick the player does not wish to take. It {{can also be used to}} void other suits allowing play of trump cards in tricks where that suit is led.|$|E
25|$|STV {{has some}} {{history in the}} United States. Many cities, {{including}} New York City, once used it {{to break up the}} Democratic Party monopolies on elective office. Cincinnati, Ohio, adopted STV in 1925 <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Republican Party monopoly, but the Republicans returned the city to FPTP in 1957. From 1870 to 1980, Illinois used a semi-proportional cumulative voting system to elect its House of Representatives. Each district across the state elected both Republicans and Democrats year-after-year. Cambridge, Massachusetts, (STV) and Peoria, Illinois, (cumulative voting) continue to use PR. San Francisco had citywide elections in which people would cast votes for five or six candidates simultaneously, delivering some of the benefits of proportional representation.|$|E
25|$|Because R. romandi nests {{can often}} be found on buildings, {{it is common for}} wasp nests to be built in heavily human {{populated}} areas. Their nests do not cause any structural damage, so if the nests are located in out of the way areas, they are best left alone. Attempting to knock them down will induce the aggressive behavior described above, and R. romandi tend to rebuild nests in similar spots. Additionally, paper wasps feed their young on caterpillars, so they can help eliminate common garden and agricultural pests. If one does have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nest, it is recommended that the job is done by a professional exterminator, or with a fast acting can of insecticide. The best time to get rid of an R. romandi nest is at dawn or after dark when the wasps are most docile.|$|E

Orlov, accompanied by Gustav Orreus and four regiments of troops, arrived in Moscow on September 26, immediately calling an emergency council with local doctors. They confirmed presence of both bubonic and septicemic forms of plague. Orlov established and supervised an executive medical commission charged with developing the ways to check the epidemic. More important, he succeeded in changing public opinion in favor of the state's emergency measures, at the same improving the efficiency and quality of medical quarantine (in particular, varying quarantine duration for different groups of exposed but yet healthy people, and paying them for the quarantine stay).|$|E
500|$|Gunsmoke was {{originally}} a half-hour program filmed in black-and-white. The series expanded {{to an hour}} in length with season seven and began filming in color in season twelve. During its run 635 episodes were broadcast, of which 233 were 30 minutes in length and 402 were 60 minutes in length. [...] Of the hour-long episodes 176 were in black-and-white and 226 in color. During season two, Gunsmoke {{became one of the}} ten most popular programs on American television and moved to number one in the third season. It remained at number one until 1961 and stayed in the top twenty until 1964. The series returned to prominence in 1967 following a shift in its programming time from Saturday to Monday night. [...] From there Gunsmoke remained in the top twenty for the next seven years, dropping out only in its final season. [...] In May 1975 CBS canceled the series. [...] Alan Wagner, the network's vice president at the time, said, [...] "It's better <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> program one year too soon than one year too late." [...] Between 1987 and 1994 five television movies based on the series were aired by CBS.|$|E

The {{only child}} of a clone, she has {{inherited}} the apparent accelerated healing ability demonstrated by Sarah and Helena, and has shown the ability to tell the clones apart {{even when they are}} posing as each other. It would seem that her intelligence is greater than a normal child's, being able to figure out Cal is her father within moments of meeting him, and that he needed a distraction <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suspicious cop; she also seems to have some of Sarah's skills as she was able to steal a nurse's phone during an examination without her notice and use it to call Cal. After Rudy threatens Kira, Sarah sends Kira to Iceland with her father Cal; they reunite in the third-season finale. In season four, Kira seems to have developed a latent psychic ability; she dreamed about her [...] "aunts" [...] killing Sarah because she was [...] "changing". (seasons 1â€“5) ...|$|E

About 110 tons of ammunition and CS gas were made ready in New Jersey for a potential airlift to Viracopos Airport in Campinas.

The trio moves to Harlem, [...] "home to every black man". When they arrive, Rabbit, Bear, and Fox find that it is not all that it is made out to be. They encounter a con man named Simple Savior, a phony revolutionary leader who claims to be the cousin of [...] "Black Jesus", and that he gives his followers [...] "the strength to kill whites". In a flashy stage performance in his [...] "church", Savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppressionâ€”represented by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley, and Richard Nixon, before asking his parishioners for [...] "donations". Rabbit and his friends quickly realize Savior's [...] "revolution" [...] is merely a money making scam. Rabbit openly steals {{a large portion of the}} donation money, prompting Savior to try to have him killed. After Rabbit tricks his would-be murderers (in a paraphrasing of the story of Br'er Rabbit and the briar patch), he and Bear kill Savior. This allows Rabbit to take over Savior's racket, putting him in line to become the head of all organized crime in Harlem. Rabbit lays out his plan to keep all organized crime money in Harlem. But first, he has <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few other opponents. Savior's former partners tell Rabbit they will join him but only if he can kill his opponents, otherwise they will kill him instead.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} is Vin Scully's call of Kirk Gibson's game inning {{home run in}} Game 1 of the 1988 World Series of the 1988 World Series: [...] "All year long, they looked to him to light the fire, [...] and all year long, he answered the demands, until he was physically unable to start tonight â€“ with two bad legs: The bad left hamstring, and the swollen right knee. And, with two out, {{you talk about a}} roll of the dice... this is it." [...] Scully made repeated references to Gibson's legs, noting at one point that the batter was [...] "shaking his left leg, making it quiver, like a horse trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> troublesome fly." [...] Gibson worked the count to 3â€“2 as Mike Davis stole second base; the camera turned at that point to Steve Sax getting ready for his turn at the plate, and Scully reminded the viewers that Sax was waiting on deck, but that the game right now is at the plate. [...] "High fly ball into right field, she i-i-i-is... gone!!" [...] Scully said nothing for over a minute, allowing the pictures to tell the story. Finally, he said, [...] "In a year that has been so improbable... the impossible has happened!" [...] Returning to the subject of Gibson's banged-up legs during a replay, Scully joked, [...] "And, now, the only question was, could he make it around the base paths unassisted?!" [...] "You know, I said it once before, a few days ago, that Kirk Gibson was not the Most Valuable Player; that the Most Valuable Player for the Dodgers was Tinkerbell. But, tonight, I think Tinkerbell backed off for Kirk Gibson. And, look at Eckersley â€“ shocked to his toes!" [...] "They are going wild at Dodger Stadium â€“ no one wants to leave!" [...] As NBC showed a replay of Gibson rounding second base in his home run trot, Scully then made a point to note Eckersley's pitching performance throughout the 1988 season, to put things in perspective. [...] "Dennis Eckersley allowed five home runs all year. And we'll be back." ...|$|E
