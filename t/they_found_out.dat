5|$|According to Bobby Darin's agent, Martin Baum, Paul Newman's agent {{turned down}} the part of Fast Eddie. Newman was {{originally}} unavailable to play Fast Eddie regardless, being committed to star opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the film Two for the Seesaw. Rossen offered Darin the part after seeing him on The Mike Wallace Interview. When Taylor was forced {{to drop out of}} Seesaw because of shooting overruns on Cleopatra, Newman was freed up to take the role, which he accepted after reading just half of the script. No one associated with the production officially notified Darin or his representatives that he had been replaced; <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> from a member of the public at a charity horse race.|$|E

5|$|The Arab states {{surrounding}} the Mandate of Palestine started to prepare themselves {{a few weeks}} before May 15. According to the Arab plan, the Syrian army was to attack the new state from southern Lebanon and capture Safed. As such, the Syrians massed their forces in that area; however, after <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that Lebanon did not wish to actively participate in combat, their plans changed to an attack from the southern Golan Heights on Samakh (Tzemah) and later Tiberias. The Syrian force assembled in Qatana on May 1. It moved on May 12 to Beirut and to Sidon on May 13, after which it headed to Bint Jbeil. After the sudden plan change, the force moved to Nabatieh, and proceeded around the Finger of the Galilee to Banias and Quneitra, from which the eventual attack was staged.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of Rayon and Dr. Eve Saks were fictional; the writers had interviewed transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors {{for the film}} and combined these stories to create the two composite supporting roles. However, Woodroof did lose all his friends after <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> he was HIV-positive. In his interviews with Borten, Woodroof implied that this, along with interactions with gay people living with AIDS through the buyers club, led to a rethinking of his apparent anti-gay sentiments and changed his views on gay people. Other people who knew him {{said that he did}} not harbor anti-gay sentiments and was himself bisexual. Also, while a rodeo enthusiast, he never rode any bulls himself. Although the film shows Woodroof diagnosed in 1985, he told Borten that a doctor had informed him he might have had the disease well before that; Woodroof believed that he may have been infected in 1981, something that was briefly alluded to in a flashback in the film.|$|E
5|$|As Boyce's {{interest}} in philanthropy grew, {{he turned to}} his childhood experiences in the outdoors as a resource, but could not find a way to channel his charitable ideas and dreams until a fateful stop to England while en route to what became the failed photographic expedition to Africa. Events in London on the way to and from this expedition would lead to the founding of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), one of many civic and professional organizations formed during the Progressive Era to fill the void of citizens who had become distended from their rural roots. Many youth organizations such as the Woodcraft Indians and Sons of Daniel Boone formed in America in the early 1900s focusing on outdoor character-building activities. The writings and adventures of Theodore Roosevelt contributed to these movements, with their outdoor, nature, and pioneer themes. By the time of his 1922 expedition to Africa, Boyce was so well respected in Scouting that French Boy Scouts in Algeria saluted him and offered to escort him along a trail when <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> he was the founder of BSA and LSA in America.|$|E

5|$|Before {{relation}} with his later wife Gertrud Weiss, Leo Szilard's life {{partner in the}} period 1927 – 1934 was kindergarten teacher and opera singer Gerda Philipsborn, who also worked as a volunteer in a Berlin asylum organization for refugee children and in 1932 moved to India to continue in this work. Szilard married Gertrud (Trude) Weiss, a physician, in a civil ceremony in New York on October 13, 1951. They {{had known each other}} since 1929, and had frequently corresponded and visited each other ever since. Weiss took up a teaching position at the University of Colorado in April 1950, and Szilard began staying with her in Denver {{for weeks at a time}} when they had never been together for more than a few days before. Single people living together was frowned upon in the conservative United States at the time, and after they were discovered by one of her students, Szilard began to worry that she might lose her job. Their relationship remained a long-distance one, and they kept news of their marriage quiet. Many of his friends were shocked when <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>out,</b> as it was widely believed that Szilard was a born bachelor.|$|E
25|$|Researchers from Cornell University in Ithaca {{studied the}} {{emergent}} behavior of crowds at mosh pits by analyzing online videos, finding similarities with models of 2-D gases in equilibrium. Simulating the crowds with computer models, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that a simulation dominated by flocking parameters produced highly ordered behavior, forming vortexes like those {{seen in the}} videos.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Thomson, de la Haye {{and their}} {{associates}} wanted {{to incorporate the}} new airline under the name Scottish Airways. When <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that BEA had already reserved this name, the company was incorporated as Caledonian Airways (Prestwick) in Prestwick, Scotland, in April 1961 to conduct worldwide IT and group charter operations, with de la Haye and Thomson being appointed managing and deputy managing director respectively.|$|E

25|$|On March 2, 1809 the {{municipal}} authorities prepared a welcome for {{the visit of}} Lodewijk Napoleon, king of the short-lived Kingdom of Holland. They were disappointed when <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> the king had already passed Ommen the day before. The three burgomasters quickly pursued the king and met with his party near Gramsbergen, still receiving a gift of 1000 Dutch guilders for the well-intended preparations for his visit.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Hirao and {{co-workers}} {{have found that}} asymmetric reduction of prochiral armomatic ketones with chiral amino alcohols and borane afforded the corresponding secondary alcohols with 60% ee. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that the chiral amino alcohols would react with borane to form aloxyl-amine-borane complexes. The complexes are proposed to contain a relatively rigid five member-ring system which makes them thermal and hydrolytic stable and soluble {{in a wide variety}} of protic and aprotic solvents.|$|E
25|$|In 1864, all the French territories in {{southern}} Vietnam were declared {{to be the}} new French colony of Cochinchina. In 1866, France started the exploration of the Mekong river, with the objective of reaching the riches of China, under Ernest Doudart de Lagrée and Francis Garnier. They reached the Yunnan, discovering that the Mekong was not navigable as far as China. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> instead that the Song-Koï river in Tonkin would be a good alternative.|$|E

Reno Tahei (ex-Sounds Unlimited, Compulsion, Castaways, Luke's Walnut, Genesis) filled in on drums for a few months until Wilson returned. Tahei was arrested and was deported back to New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|In October 1917, while Lishansky was in Zikhron Ya'akov, the Ottoman {{authorities}} received {{information about}} Nili's activities by accidentally catching a homing pigeon {{with a message}} from Sarah Aaronsohn, and after capturing the Nili operative Na'aman Belkind, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> about a cell in Zikhron. They encircled the village, capturing Sarah Aaronsohn, but Lishansky managed to escape, and became a fugitive with a price on his head. He met with HaShomer members carrying gold and accompanied them to Tel Adas.|$|E
25|$|In the Puerto Rican Campaign, Marine {{detachments}} under Lieutenant John A. Lejeune {{landed in}} Fajardo {{in order to}} seize boats for a subsequent landing by Army forces.

25|$|The band {{managed to}} strike a record deal with Enigma Records in 1985, after Hart's high school friend, Eric Blair, (who worked for the Christian metal band Stryper) pitched the Rock in Victory EP to Enigma Records President, Wesley Hein. When <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> there was a Spanish band also going by the name Fusion, they changed the band name to Gardian - {{intentionally}} misspelled to have 7 letters. In early 1986, Caro left the band {{and was replaced by}} guitarist Tony Palacios. With Palacios, there surfaced a bootleg EP, Voyager in 1987—which were really just pre-production demos recorded in the backroom of an Orange County music store.|$|E
25|$|Andersen et al. {{were able}} to {{generate}} {{a model of the}} (S)-citalopram binding site in human SERT by combining mutational analysis and comparative modeling where <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that Asn-177 and Phe-341 where key determinants for (S)-citalopram potency and high affinity inhibition in addition to Tyr-95, Asp-98, Ile-172 and Ser438 previously described, where three functional groups of the inhibitors structure bind to the transporters amino acids. (S)-citalopram is positioned as that the cyanophthalane-. fluorophenyl- and methylaminoprpyl moieties occupy three different sub-pockets within the SERT binding pocket. Ile-172 and Phe-341 are likely not in direct contact with the drug molecule, but they are very important for controlling alignment of the inhibitor.|$|E
