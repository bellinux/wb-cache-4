40|$|This paper {{provides}} a methodological framework for {{decision making process}} to ensure its traceability generally {{in the context of}} telemedicine and particularly in the act of <b>teleexpertise.</b> This act permits to medical professionals and/or health professionals to collaborate in order to take suitable decisions for a patient diagnosis or treatment. The main problem dealing with <b>teleexpertise</b> is the following: How to ensure the traceability of the decisions making process? This problem is solved in this paper through a conceptualisation of a rigorous framework coupling semantic modelling and explicit reasoning which permits to fully support the analysis and rationale for decisions made. The logical semantic underlying this framework is the argumentative logicto provide adequate management of information with traceability of the reasoning including options and constraints. Thus our proposal will permit to formally ensure the traceability of reasoning in telemedicine and particularly in <b>teleexpertise</b> in order to favour the quality of telemedicine’s procedure checking. This traceability is to guarantee equitable access to the benefits of the collective knowledge and experience and to provide remote collaborative practices with a sufficient safety margin to guard against the legal requirements. An illustrative case study is provided by the modelling of a decision making process applied to <b>teleexpertise</b> for chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 2...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTelemedicine allows {{collaborative}} activities between {{health professionals}} for {{the deployment of}} medical procedures carried out remotely by means of device using information and communication technologies. This article focuses on the <b>Teleexpertise</b> that allows collaboration between medical professionals in order to share knowledge and expert advices used as explanation elements for decision support. We propose a conceptual model integrating the FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) Contract Net Protocol which permits to collect medical professionals' answers for a request for <b>teleexpertise</b> in an efficient manner. Our model satisfies four requirements (coverage, QoS (Quality of Service) guarantees and prioritisation, mobility and roaming, service usability) on the configuration and operation of the underlying network and the services. Therefore, we provide an operational assistance by improvement of the networks quality of service via interoperable web services. Finally, we hope to bring a tangible contribution on the implementation of this suggested conceptualization that will allow to generate relevant and action-oriented finding...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTelemedicine {{consists}} {{of the use of}} information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the practice of medicine. The massive digitalisation of the society is changing the behaviour of ordinary people even in medical sectors. The impact of digitisation is also having impacts on <b>teleexpertise,</b> where a medical professional can remotely ask some advices through the use of ICTs to provide treatment to a patient in critical conditions in remote environment. However, sometimes the outcome of such advice obtained remotely can lead to medical errors. In these situations, it is important to determine whether the causes of the errors could have been avoidable or not for the purposes of establishing the truth and assuring justice for the victims of medical errors. The proposed work fits this perspective with the objective to formalise elements of argumentation in collaborative medical organisations using telemedicine. In other words, a technique that extends the Dung's argumentation framework in order to bring out the errors committed following a remote medical procedure has been proposed. The proposed technique is underpinned by graphical reasoning. The reasoning is represented through a directed graph in which the extended nodes specify the arguments with their source(s) and the identification of errors is done according to the Makeham's and Tempos taxonomies. To illustrate the functioning of the proposed technique or solution, an example of the practice of <b>teleexpertise</b> (between two French hospitals) that leads to litigation is presented...|$|E
40|$|Current medical {{information}} systems are too complex to be meaningfully exploited. Hence {{there is a}} need to develop new strategies for maximising the exploitation of medical data to the benefit of medical professionals. It is against this backdrop that we want to propose a tangible contribution by providing a tool which combines conceptual graphs and Dung׳s argumentation system in order to assist medical professionals in their decision making process. The proposed tool allows medical professionals to easily manipulate and visualise queries and answers for making decisions during the practice of <b>teleexpertise.</b> The knowledge modelling is made using an open application programming interface (API) called CoGui, which offers the means for building structured knowledge bases with the dedicated functionalities of graph-based reasoning via retrieved data from different institutions (hospitals, national security centre, and nursing homes). The tool that we have described in this study supports a formal traceable structure of the reasoning with acceptable arguments to elucidate some ethical problems that occur very often in the telemedicine domain...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{complexity}} {{of the health care}} system is a particularly notable framework for the development of telehealth and telemedicine. It is therefore necessary to try to answer the relevant question that can be summarized broadly as ''How to manage this complex system?'' We will discuss here the relations between system engineering and telehealth, or more specifically how systems engineering can be applied in the design of a telehealth system, and what benefits it can bring in its development. This naturally leads us to think of methods you can use to understand the difficulty of decision-making and the conceptual perspectives. It has been an accepted fact that this first requires modeling, i. e. to construct a representation of the perceived reality through symbols and relevant rules, then to verify or validate in absolute terms this representation, model, so as to improve or be able to use it. The importance of this modeling and the rigorous analysis of the requirements of telemedicine systems are even more apparent since the recognition of the generic representation declined in two meta-models: the first covers the activities of teleconsultation, <b>teleexpertise</b> and teleassistance; the second concerns telemonitoring...|$|E
