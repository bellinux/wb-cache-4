In March 2010, Henrik and Johanna made a joint $1.5million donation, with Daniel and his wife Marinette, to the BC Children's Hospital's $200 million project for a new building; the two families requested that it be put towards a pediatric intensive-care unit and a diagnostic imaging area.

Agnew declined the opportunity, opting to remain BBC cricket correspondent, {{in part because he}} was a [...] "radio man" [...] and in part out of loyalty. The following year, England hosted the 1999 Cricket World Cup. The BBC had the UK television rights, but with so many specialist TV cricket presenters now at Channel 4 and therefore unavailable to the BBC, Agnew was asked to present the coverage. His recollections of the experience are <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> of a trial, helped only by the experienced Richie Benaud alongside him: ...|$|E

According to Lopez, {{she knew}} that there was {{something}} [...] "inside of me that I have to offer to this [...] And then, you know, things happen. Things have a weird way of happening naturally and organically when they're supposed to. And I feel that this song was just meant to be, for this movie. Basically, I wrote the song for me to go through all these kinds of things as an actress with this character. You draw from all different experiences in your life. From way back to the present, to whatever, to make it really true and honest". [...] "Alive" [...] means [...] "the world" [...] to Lopez because of its positive message and the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that she created with Judd.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{was made}} in 1993 for the first season and remained unchanged until Duchovny left the show. Carter sought to make the title an [...] "impactful opening" [...] with [...] "supernatural images". These scenes notably include a split-screen image of a seed germinating {{as well as a}} [...] "terror-filled, warped face". The latter was created when Carter found a video operator who was able to create the effect. The sequence was extremely popular and won the show its first Emmy Award, which was for Outstanding Graphic Design and Title Sequences. Rabwin was particularly pleased with the sequence and felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that had [...] "never [...] seen on television before". In 2017, James Charisma of Paste (magazine) ranked the show's opening sequence #8 on a list of The 75 Best TV Title Sequences of All Time.|$|E
500|$|Beghe was a {{guest in}} May 2009 on the BBC World Service radio program , where he {{discussed}} his views on {{what he thought of}} Scientology when he first joined: [...] "I thought <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that was going to deliver miracles, and that it was the most selfless group of people that were totally dedicated to helping mankind, and I {{wanted to be part of}} it." [...] He was also critical of the Scientology organization leadership, including its head David Miscavige: [...] "I think that there are probably things of Scientology that are valuable and that can help people - my main issue is not with Scientology per se, it is with Scientology the organization - it is a corrupt I believe and probably a criminal endeavor, and that has to do with people who are in charge of Scientology mainly David Miscavige..." ...|$|E

500|$|Watoosh! saw {{the band}} mixing {{multiple}} genres and making diverse {{songs on the}} same album, stretching from hip hop to indie and ska punk. However, this evolved into a more collected sound that was a mix of fewer genres on their second album, Billy Talent. The result of {{this has not been}} described by the band as their defining sound and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that appeared to them after experimenting with different styles. [...] On Billy Talent II, the band altered their sound yet again, based on more mid-tempo and emotional compositions; a bit more collected than their previous work. It was also based on far less angst and aggression behind the production, things that were known factors behind their debut. [...] In their music there are raw and frequent backup vocals heavily collaborated by main vocals, quick changes between loud and quiet, and Kowalewicz's characteristic vocals which are the key elements that emphasize that assertion.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Ten were completed in May 1991. Krusen left the band once the sessions were completed, checking himself into rehabilitation. According to Krusen, {{he was suffering}} from personal problems at the time. Krusen said, [...] "It was a great experience. I felt from the beginning of that band <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> special," [...] and added, [...] "They had to let me go. I couldn't stop drinking, and it was causing problems. They gave me many chances, but I couldn't get it together." [...] In June, the band joined Tim Palmer in England for mixing. Palmer decided to mix the album at Ridge Farm Studios in Dorking, a converted farm that according to Palmer was [...] "about as far away from an L.A. or New York studio as you can get." [...] Palmer made a few additions to the already-recorded songs, including having McCready finish up the guitar solo on [...] "Alive" [...] and tweaking the intro to [...] "Black". Palmer overdubbed a pepper shaker and a fire extinguisher as percussion on [...] "Oceans".|$|E
500|$|Sale el Sol is {{considered}} to be Shakira's return to her [...] "roots" [...] and is a [...] "fusion between rock and pop heavily influenced from Latino and Colombian music". Shakira said there are three [...] "directions" [...] of Sale el Sol: a romantic one, a [...] "very rock and roll" [...] one, and a [...] "Latino, tropical" [...] one. Explaining the romantic [...] "direction" [...] of the album, she said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> [...] "which I hadn't tapped into for the past three years, but it suddenly came to me and I couldn't hold it back. So it’s [...] got songs that are very intense, very romantic [...] ". Examples include ballads like [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] ("Before Six O'Clock") and [...] "Lo Que Mas" [...] ("The Most"); in the former Shakira delivers [...] "sad, emotional, and heartfelt vocals," [...] while in the latter she sings over a piano and string-supplemented melody. About the rock and roll [...] "direction" [...] of the album, Shakira said [...] "I started my career as a rock artist and then I kind of crossed over into pop, so it’s been fun to re-encounter that side of my artistic personality".|$|E

500|$|A {{lot of my}} {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, so we thought 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> I would love forever.|$|E
500|$|Wipeout 2048 was {{developed}} by Sony Studio Liverpool, known as Psygnosis during {{the development of the}} early Wipeout games. Studio Liverpool's technical director, Stuart Lovegrove, affirmed that the game {{was developed}} in parallel with the PlayStation Vita and was a testbed for the console. Lovegrove was aware that the next Wipeout game would be a launch title, and said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> Studio Liverpool had done before. Chris Roberts, the game's director of graphics, tools and technologies, said that Sony Computer Entertainment involved the Liverpudlian studio early {{in the development of the}} PlayStation Vita and had a [...] "fairly good idea" [...] of the console's capability. Jon Eggleton, former senior artist of the Wipeout series, said in an interview that Studio Liverpool influenced the Vita's design. When staff were given development kits for what was called a [...] "next-generation portable", a group was formed to brainstorm hardware details; proposals included a touchscreen device, not yet conceived by Sony. Eggleton speculated that the console was released with two analogue sticks solely because [...] "Studio Liverpool said it needed two sticks". During early development of Wipeout 2048 and the PlayStation Vita, the studio provided Sony with feedback on the hardware and libraries and sent updated application code to Sony's firmware staff for testing their compilers. Both Lovegrove and Roberts were impressed with the simplicity of the Vita's firmware, in contrast to the architecture [...] of the PlayStation 3.|$|E
500|$|The episode [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I." [...] {{introduces}} the Kree alien {{race to the}} MCU, members of which {{play a significant role}} in Guardians of the Galaxy. This begins a storyline that recurs throughout the series, and introduces Inhumans to the MCU, with Jed Whedon saying <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> [...] "in the works" [...] for a long time, as Marvel Studios had plans for an Inhumans film, and this would be [...] "one of the first instances where we get to start planting the seeds on the show before the film." [...] The third season {{introduces the}} concept of the Secret Warriors, with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name, while also retconning the history of Hydra in the MCU, tying it into the Inhumans storyline. Gregg noted in January 2016 that the [...] "writer and director [...] will have free rein to do what they want to do with the Inhumans, but hopefully there'll be some way that our Inhumans connect to that." [...] When the film was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, Whedon noted that the series had [...] "a little more freedom" [...] and were [...] "able to do a little bit more" [...] with the species going into the fourth season, including the potential of introducing some of the [...] "classic" [...] Inhumans. Marvel's Inhumans, a television series centered on Black Bolt and other members of the Inhuman Royal Family, was announced in November 2016 to air on ABC in September 2017. It is not intended to be a spin-off of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

500|$|Bradley Joseph {{was born}} in Bird Island, Minnesota and raised in Willmar, Minnesota, graduating from Willmar Senior High School in 1983. [...] He learned how to play piano from a how-to piano book he found in the piano bench. [...] One morning his father {{taught him how to}} play a boogie-woogie blues tune and by nightfall he could play the entire piece. [...] He started playing {{classical}} piano at age eight, taking lessons {{for a year and a}} half but was self-taught thereafter. [...] While in junior high, he took a concert field trip where he saw Buddy Rich perform. He recalls, [...] "I sat in the first row and when Buddy's sax player stood up to take his first solo something just clicked — the world closed in around me. I felt the power of music and knew <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> special, a gift to be shared." [...] Joseph played piano for the jazz band and choir in high school, and trombone through high school and college. [...] When he picked up the horn, he got a whole new perspective on music, gaining insight into all the different timbres available, which was invaluable to him when he started working with orchestras. [...] The first band he was in was a wedding dance band which allowed him to gain experience in every different style of music from polkas to rock and roll to jazz classics. [...] After attending Moorhead State University as a music major, he led some of his own bands around the area that toured Midwest nightclubs. [...] He played sax and guitar in some of these earlier bands but left them to concentrate on just the piano/keyboards. Later, he started performing with guitarist Dugan McNeill, whose U2-like group was signed to Polygram. [...] McNeill and Yanni had once played together in the technopop band Chameleon in the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake {{on the video}} for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E

[...] Strangely, this change of opinion did not make it back to Britain where Mantell was mocked for his error. Mantell was still convinced that the teeth had come from the Mesozoic strata and finally recognised that they resembled those of the iguana, but were twenty times larger. He surmised that the owner of the remains must have been at least 60feet (18metres) in length.|$|E
