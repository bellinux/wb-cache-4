Many of the released prisoners were communists who quickly used the new freedoms of speech <b>to</b> <b>organize</b> <b>a</b> protest attended by approximately 400 people in Kaunas on 13 June. The protest was dispersed. The new government's opposition used this protest as the platform for a public attack on the government, alleging that it was allowing illegal organizations (the Communist Party of Lithuania was still outlawed) to continue their activities freely. Despite its local nature, the incident was presented as {{a major threat to}} Lithuania and its military; the government was said to be incapable of dealing with this threat.|$|E
5|$|After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), many Poles {{believed}} that revolutionary France, whose public opinion was very {{sympathetic to the}} ideals of the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791, would come to Poland's aid. France's enemies included Poland's partitioners, Prussia, Austria and Imperial Russia. Paris was the seat of two Polish organizations laying the claim to be the Polish government-in-exile, the Deputation (Deputacja) of Franciszek Ksawery Dmochowski and the Agency (Agencja) of JÃ³zef Wybicki. Many Polish soldiers, officers and volunteers therefore emigrated, especially to Italy and to France. Eventually, the Agency was successful in convincing the French government (the Directory) <b>to</b> <b>organize</b> <b>a</b> Polish military unit. As the French Constitution did not allow for the employment of foreign troops on French soil, the French decided to use the Poles to bolster their allies in Italy, the Cisalpine Republic.|$|E
