Russia, while fulfilling the other obligations, steadily denied since 2002 that it ever made a clear commitment to withdraw its troops, but Russia did withdraw 58 trainloads of equipment and ammunition from <b>Transdniestria.</b> No further withdrawals have occurred since 2004. Russia argues that it has fulfilled all of its obligations by signing the agreements with Georgia to close the Batumi and Akhalkalaki bases and withdraw the Russian troops stationed there by the end of 2008. As long as not all troops are withdrawn from Georgia and Moldova, NATO members refuse to ratify the treaty. This includes the dismantling of the one remaining base (after 2008) in Georgia: the Gudauta base located in Abkhazia. This has been viewed as an attempt to postpone ratification. Abkhazia is a de facto independent break-away republic within the internationally recognized borders of Georgia. In 2002 and 2006 referendums were held in which Abkhazians voted by large margins for de jure independence.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe article {{introduces}} {{a set of}} remedial conditions that might justify unilateral secession under international public law and examines whether remedial secession might be applied in the post-Soviet “frozen conflicts”: South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, <b>Transdniestria</b> and Crimea. The article concludes that the remedial right to secession has no relevance in the “frozen conflicts” in post-Soviet region and neither of the entities cannot justify their independence on remedial secession. However, all the cases confirm {{the existence of the}} right and its conditions. Moreover, the situations of the “frozen conflicts” in the post-Soviet region add clarity to the procedural criterion for the exercise of the negotiations. Negotiations in good faith are possible merely if the conflicting parties are not influenced by the third states, which violate international law. The cases of South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, <b>Transdniestria</b> and Crimea reveal that the right to remedial secession simply is not relevant in the cases which are related to the unlawful use of force or other egregious violations of the norms of international law. Remedial secession cannot be exercised in the cases, created in serious breach of international law norms...|$|E

40|$|The present note is a {{response}} to the invitation from Moldova to comment on the new draft agreement proposed by Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE to resolve the decade-old stand-off between Moldova and <b>Transdniestria,</b> following the conflict over the latter’s attempted secession in 1992. It is a contribution to an open international debate over the search for a viable solution. Summary At a meeting in Kiev on 1 - 3 July 2002, the mediators for the Moldovan- <b>Transdniestria</b> conflict proposed, at the initiative of the OSCE, a draft agreement on the constitutional system that would regulate the distribution of competencies between Chisinau and Tiraspol. This draft agreement defines the Republic of Moldova as a “federal state”. The implementation of the agreement would be monitored and ultimately guaranteed by the Russian Federation, Ukraine and the OSCE. 1 It is to be greatly welcomed that the interested parties have reached the stage of negotiation over a full text to finally resolve a conflict in a constitutionally ordered way. It is also notable, and highly positive, that this process is now being made open and transparent. This improves the chances that the outcome will be viewed as democratically legitimate by the population, which is an important condition for its long-term viability. Under the present circumstances, the choice of a federal solution should also be welcomed as the best option for a multi-national state such as Moldova. Furthermore, the federalisation of Moldova could lead to a positive spillover effect in the frozen conflicts of the southern Caucasus...|$|E

Here OSCE has succeeded in transforming conflicts that have broken out and in contributing to the prevention of future conflicts.

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{research on}} ethnic {{conflict in the}} Former Soviet Union (FSU). Various appealing but unsatisfactory typologies have been proposed, focusing on the subjects of the conflict (actors, goals, motivations); on {{the environment of the}} conflict (territory, language, socio-economy, environment and resources; or on characteristics of the conflict (scale, length, form of fighting, losses, aftermath). Most conflict typologies reflect better the thinking and political agenda of the typologists than the actual social panorama. Conflict theories and data presentations contain strong prescriptive elements and may even generate new conflict. For the conflicts in the Former Soviet Union, existing typologies fail to grasp several major factors, such as the strategies and behavior of individuals, social and political disorder, power and status aspirations, elite manipulations, and outside interventions. This article discusses data on human and material losses in nine violent conflicts: Karabakh, Fergana, Osh, South Ossetia, <b>Transdniestria,</b> Tajik, Abkhazia, Ingush–Ossetian, and Chechen.

40|$|After Kosovo’s independence, {{politicians}} and the press of various territorial entities aspiring for independent statehood had pointed to the Kosovo ‘precedence’, for example <b>Transdniestria,</b> Nagorno-Karabakh, the Republika Srpska, and Palestine. Overall, both {{in the context of}} the Kosovo’s protracted path to formal independence, after its declaration of independence (DoI), in the course of the proceedings before the ICJ, and more recently, some political actors time and again highlighted the sui generis nature of the Kosovo issue, and denied that it would have (and should have) any precedential value, while others on the contrary relied on the ‘precedent’. This chapter analyzes the merits of these claims. It concludes that the Advisory Opinion, while not being a precedent in a technical sense, had the unfortunate effect, due to its failure to spell out clear limits of secession, of not containing subsequent (erroneous) reliance on its meagre holdings. With regard to the possible ‘precedential’ value of the DoI and its implicit endorsement by states and the Court, the chapter concludes that the denial of ‘precedent’ had the legal effect of stalling the formation of a general opinio iuris on secession, but that the legal technique of distinguishing is a sufficient and normatively preferable strategy to contain other instances of imminent secessions...|$|E
40|$|The Gagauz {{leadership}} has advanced several basic demands. The first category of demands relates to economic concerns and these {{appear to be}} the most fundamental. The situation that they insist be addressed in that there is an economic disparity between Gagauzia {{and the rest of the}} Moldovan Republic. If one looks beyond the rhetoric of Comrat, Gagauz political demands are secondary to the economic ones. They demand political parties that would operate in local elections. They want more seats in the Moldovan Parliament and believe that all laws should be published in the Gagauz language as well as in Russian and Romanian. While much has been said about Turkish involvement with Gagauzia, this has not served to generate any feeling among the Gaguz that their cultural roots are in Turkey. Those who emigrate are most likely to go, first, to the United States and, second, to Russia. Ties between Gagauzia and <b>Transdniestria</b> reached their closest during the early part of the 1990 s. Since that time Gagauzia has found a more effective relationship working within the Moldovan Republic. The confrontations of recent months are a product of the Moldovan political crisis, not intervention from Tiraspol. They have led to a renewal of ties between these two regions. Transdniestria’s fundamental demand is to assume equal status with the Moldovan Republic within a confederation. There appear to be limited prospects for a renewal of violence such as that seen in 1992. Direct foreign intervention by any one of the three nations with the greatest interests in this situation – Russia, the Ukraine, and Romania – appears unlikely barring a renewal of violence...|$|E
40|$|The {{most serious}} foreign policy {{challenge}} that the Russian Federation faced from 1991 to 1996 was {{whether and how}} to respond to outbreaks of conflict within its neighbouring states. Unlike under the Soviet Union, there were open, diverse and complex debates about whether Russia should react to these conflicts, and if so, by what means. These foreign policy debates among the political elite and the ensuing policies form the subject of this thesis. The thesis asks what the dominant ideas expressed in these debates about foreign policy were, and whether they were reflected in Russia's policies towards specific military conflicts in the CIS States. To answer these questions, the thesis first derives insights about the role of ideas and debates within international relations literature which are helpful for the subsequent analysis of Russian foreign policy debates. It then identifies the dominant foreign policy ideas and foreign policy orientations, traces the major stages in the debates and the policies, and compares Russia's political debates, policies and actions towards the Moldova- <b>Transdniestria,</b> Georgia-Abkhazia and Tajikistan conflicts. Using interviews and both primary and secondary sources, the general finding of the thesis is that broad foreign policy ideas and orientations provided the backdrop against which debates occurred and policies were formulated or pursued. Ideas and debates were crucial factors in developing and defining an official pragmatic nationalist foreign policy orientation that crystallised in the later period. On the whole, there was congruence between the dominant ideas within the debates and the foreign policies enacted towards specific conflicts. Specific foreign policies towards the conflicts developed in response to the general debate (clash of ideas), which in turn responded to the domestic conditions and particular events in the near abroad. Military actions tended to start independently as local initiatives, and then fall in line with government policy...|$|E
40|$|Most {{scholars}} {{agree that}} modern states share several defining characteristics: a population, territory, government, {{and the capacity}} to enter into international relations. More recently, this list has expanded to include the criteria of democracy, the rule of law, and the protection of human rights. These traditional and contemporary criteria for statehood are likewise essential for settling the status of de facto states, entities that seek international recognition yet are rebuffed by the world community. By examining the criteria for international recognition from the perspective of constitutional law, this dissertation reveals the existing but overlooked relationship between the recognition process and constitutionalism. As is shown, a constitution performs more than its usual functions of organizing and regulating a polity, limiting the government, and ensuring individuals protection. It also {{plays a key role in}} asserting and realizing both the traditional and contemporary criteria for state recognition. This linkage between constitutionalism and the recognition process is then tested on the case study of <b>Transdniestria,</b> an entity within the Republic of Moldova that has all the attributes of a state and seeks recognition of its statehood. As one of the first analyses of unrecognized foundational legal frameworks, this dissertation offers insight into how an “invisible” constitution affects the recognition process and the political status of an unrecognized state. It shows that, while the Transdniestrian constitution has not influenced the entity’s search for recognition, it has had other important effects on the negotiation process, such as consolidating Transdniestrian statehood, hardening the entity’s position in negotiations, and influencing the nature of its interactions with international actors. These outcomes broaden the understanding of the contemporary criteria for recognition and the functions of a constitution with respect to their application in unrecognized states. They also demonstrate the limitations of the prevailing approach in the literature that democratization is necessarily beneficial for the purposes of conflict resolution. In such a way, this research additionally helps to present a more nuanced picture of post-Cold War politics, law, and international relations in Europe...|$|E
40|$|Nearly {{ten years}} since the 1999 NATO {{military}} intervention against Serbia {{and the establishment of}} UN administration, Kosovo and Metohija has resurfaced as a topical issue in international politics, separating the positions of the USA and Russia, and becoming a precedent in international relations, possibly with far-reaching consequences not only {{for the future of the}} western Balkans but also for many territorial disputes worldwide. Russia has only recently pulled herself out of the years-long Chechnya crisis, and facing similar problems in her 'new neighborhood' (Abkhazia, South Ossetia <b>Transdniestria),</b> is among the countries that might be affected by this precedent. Secondly, with her bad experience in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990 s, Russia has become sensitive not only to any disturbance in the balance of power in the Balkans but also to any change to the existing international order. Moscow has not forgotten that during the 1990 s many Westerners saw Serbia as a 'metaphor for Russia' and that the NATO interventions against the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina (1995) and against Serbia (1999) revealed Russia's weakness, sending her the message to give up her interests in the Balkans and Europe. Thirdly, diverging American and Russian policies on Kosovo and Metohija coincide with their strained relations over the deployment of an antimissile 'shield' in Poland and the Czech Republic, the war in Iraq, policy towards Iran and other issues currently at the top of the list of international problems. Fourthly, meanwhile Russia has managed to recover from the disintegration of the USSR and to consolidate her economic and political power in Europe and the world, owing above all to oil and gas exports, but also to the export of industrial products (military in particular). The precedent that an independent Kosovo and Metohija would constitute in international relations is therefore a test of Russia's role as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. She has found herself in the role of the defender of the fundamental principles of international law such as the inviolability of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the UN members...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} Russia's military, {{economic and}} diplomatic policies towards {{the newly independent}} states, particularly towards {{the members of the}} CIS, during Boris Yeltsin's first term as President of an independent Russia (December 1991 to July 1996). The objective is to determine whether {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union the new Russian state tried to restore a sphere of influence or informal empire over the former Soviet republics - as the French did in sub-Saharan Africa after decolonisation - or whether instead Russia's policies reflected a genuine desire to establish normal state-to-state relations with the new states. Chapter one analyses the underlying principles of Russia's foreign policy towards the former Soviet states and examines the debate on Russian foreign policy priorities which took place during the first years of Russia's independence. This section also overviews Russia's policies towards the Russian minorities that inhabit the Baltic states, in order to determine whether Russia attempted to use this diplomatic tool to further its own interests in the area. Chapter two analyses the peculiar structure of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the extent to which Russia used this political framework to achieve hegemony over the former Soviet republics. Chapter three looks at Russia's participation in the wars in <b>Transdniestria,</b> Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabagh, and Tajikistan, and Chapter four analyses Russia's energy trade with Ukraine, Belarus, and the Caspian states. The thesis reaches the conclusion that during 1992 - mid 1996 Russia's policies only partially reflected an attempt to reassert the country's influence over the republics of the former Soviet Union and create an informal empire in the post-Soviet space. Russia's behaviour was particularly assertive in the military field as well as in its attempts to build a Russian dominated CIS military infrastructure. However, Russia's policies were less aggressive in the economic sphere, except probably as far as energy policy is concerned, and regarding the fate of Russians living beyond the new borders. More often than not, though, Russia's policies followed an ambivalent and incoherent pattern, a result of the weak and fragmented character of the Russian state...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The survey {{is part of}} the ESRC-funded project “After the War Ends: Violence in Post-Soviet Unrecognized States. ” The overall project addresses the question, what happens after the fighting in intrastate conflicts officially ends? It hones in on post-war developments in so-called de facto, or unrecognized, states. The survey deposited here took place in Nagorno Karabakh in September 2013. Nagorno Karabakh is officially part of Azerbaijan, but it has functioned as a de facto state since the war with its “parent” state Azerbaijan in 1988 - 1993. The survey, which covers 1, 000 respondents over the age of 18, asks people questions about their views on their present political, social, economic, and security situation, as well as their experiences of violence in the war of 1988 - 1993. The survey respondents were selected randomly from eight primary sampling units (the capital and the seven regions controlled by the Nagorno Karabakh authorities). Participation was entirely voluntary, and the survey responses are anonymous. The survey questions were asked in the respondents’ native tongue, by professionally trained interviewers. The survey was designed by the Dr. Bakke, based on surveys carried out elsewhere, and was commissioned to be carried out in the field by the Armenian Sociological Association. Project description: What happens after the fighting in intrastate conflicts officially ends? Peace settlements and military victories are assumed {{to bring an end to}} violence, yet they are often followed by high levels of crime and fighting among former enemies, even among former allies. Questions about post-war violence are particularly important in so-called de facto states born out of violent struggles, as these are vulnerable entities in the international system from the very outset. De facto, or unrecognized, states lack international recognition but function as state-like entities in that they control the population within their territories. While de facto states have been features on the international scene for decades, the fall of the USSR and subsequent separatist conflicts gave rise to several such state-like entities - places like Abkhazia, Chechnya, Nagorno Karabkah, South Ossetia, and <b>Transdniestria.</b> This study theorises and examines the causes and consequences of post-war violence within these de facto states. Based on statistical analyses of survey data, the study seeks to assess how the inhabitants’ experiences of criminal and political violence affect their views of the de facto states and their regimes. The study also aims to trace how the organisation and nature of war-time violence shapes post-war peace and stability (or lack thereof). The survey conducted as part of this ESRC-funded project took place in Nagorno Karabakh in September 2013. For related research based on a similar survey carried out in another de facto state (funded by the National Science Foundation in the US), see Bakke, O’Loughlin, Toal, and Ward’s 2014 article in International Studies Quarterly on “Convincing State-Builders?

40|$|After {{fifteen years}} of {{economic}} transformation, Moldova still remains a mostly agrarian country. The industrial sector is only successful in connection with agriculture (such as the production of food or beverages). The country's agrarian structure {{seems to be a}} legacy of Moldova's former role in the division of labour within the Soviet Union. Although the absence of the 'resource curse' facilitated Moldova's relative success in economic and political institutional reforms, there are still significant drawbacks in the quality of the economic order which prevent the institutional factor from compensating the 'geographical' deficits. An additional problem is the Transdniestrian conflict, which has resulted in the existence of a 'split state' and a 'split society'. High labour emigration in the wake of rising poverty, deficits of the labour market and the advantages of social integration within the post-Soviet space have a twofold effect on economic transformation they reduce internal demand and workforce potential, but also create a permanent and significant inflow of migrants' transfers and establish opportunities for learning effects. Moldova's geographical structure of trade is still dominated by the CIS. The European vector of its foreign trade remains underdeveloped, partly because of EU agricultural trade restrictions, but to a great extent because of internal trade barriers. Moldova's major comparative advantage (with respect to both the CIS and the EU, as well as globally) lies in agricultural production - food, beverages, tobacco, animal and vegetable oils - which is reflected in a very low diversification of exports. Imports are by far more diversified; the major imported goods are fuels, machinery and equipment. The energy intensity of the Moldovan economy makes the country extremely dependent on Russian gas and oil. In order to achieve positive structural shifts and move away from agricultural specialization, Moldova needs to continue economic and political reforms and improve the quality of the investment climate in order to attract FDI. A peaceful resolution of the Transdniestrian conflict is of vital importance {{from the point of view}} of investment risks. Further consolidation of democracy could help to reduce rent-seeking and state capture (which is still very high in the republic). The evolution of the Communist administration since 2001 has been very promising in this respect. Moldova seems to be a natural benefactor of 'open regionalism' solutions in the Eurasian space, which could give it an opportunity to simultaneously improve its trade relations with the EU, the CIS and Southeast Europe. The EU Neighbourhood Policy could act as a trigger for internal reforms and as a factor of external re-orientation (if major problems such as <b>Transdniestria</b> could be resolved). On the other hand, Moldova could benefit from a redesigning of post-Soviet integration to make it compatible with the Western vector of integration, reduce political aspects of the 'protective integration' currently inherent in the CIS and similar groups, and focus on the opportunities of open regionalism solutions. economic transition, restructuring, foreign trade, integration...|$|E
