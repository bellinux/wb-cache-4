In an attempt to alleviate the <b>grounding</b> <b>resistance</b> problem, we have tested three electrode designs featuring increasing sizes and surface area, in the laboratory and at three different field sites in Greenland. <b>Grounding</b> <b>resistance</b> measurements showed that changing the electrode shape (using plates instead of rods) reduced the <b>grounding</b> <b>resistances</b> at all sites by 28 %– 69 % during unfrozen and frozen ground conditions. Using meshes instead of plates (the same rectangular shape and a larger effective surface area) further improved the <b>grounding</b> <b>resistances</b> by 29 %– 37 % in winter.

Still, little information is available on <b>grounding</b> <b>resistances</b> in the geophysical literature, mainly because it is difficult to measure. The focus-one protocol is a new method for estimating single electrode <b>grounding</b> <b>resistances</b> by measuring the resistance between a single electrode in an ERT array and all the remaining electrodes connected in parallel. For large arrays, the measured resistance is dominated by the <b>grounding</b> <b>resistance</b> of the electrode under test, the focus electrode. We have developed an equivalent circuit model formulation for the resistance measured when applying the focus-one protocol. Our model depends on the individual <b>grounding</b> <b>resistances</b> of the electrodes of the array, the mutual resistances between electrodes, and the instrument input impedance. Using analytical formulations for the potentials around prolate and oblate spheroidal electrode models (as approximations for rod and plate electrodes), we have investigated the performance and accuracy of the focus-one protocol in estimating single-electrode <b>grounding</b> <b>resistances.</b> We also found that the focus-one protocol provided accurate estimations of electrode <b>grounding</b> <b>resistances</b> to within 7 % for arrays of 30 electrodes or more when the ratio of instrument input impedance to the half-space resistivity was 1000 m− 1 or more.

30|$|After {{looking into}} the {{importance}} of a good grounding system design, many researchers have carried out extensive studies in this area. Ref. [1] provided information about grounding grid performance in different soil structures after an extensive parametric study. A method for calculating the <b>grounding</b> grid <b>resistance</b> was presented in [2] based on the theoretical manipulations of the numerical moment method and the current image. This method {{has been shown to be}} dependent on the substation grounding grid design. Ref. [3] presented an analysis on evaluating grounding grids of different shapes in substations. Different shapes of grounding grids have also been considered in [4] in calculating <b>ground</b> <b>resistance</b> using the finite-element method (FEM). A substation grounding grid has been analyzed with the variation of soil layer depth in [5]. Ref. [6] conducted a study where they measured the impedances of four grounding grids using tuned-frequency test equipment operating close to the system operating frequency. FEM was used in [7] for computing the <b>grounding</b> grid <b>resistance.</b> A scheme was proposed in [8] for calculating the <b>ground</b> <b>resistance</b> using FEM to the resolution of solid models in 3 D view. As discussed in many literatures including [3, 4, 7], although FEMs are the most accurate methods for computing <b>grounding</b> grid <b>resistance,</b> these methods are quiet complicated and time consuming for grounding system design purpose. In [9], it is shown that the low or high resistivity soil layer formed in raining or freezing season affects the safety of grounding system, and leads to the changes of <b>grounding</b> <b>resistance</b> of the <b>grounding</b> system, step and touch voltages on the ground surface. A practical example of <b>ground</b> <b>resistance</b> measurement has been presented in a 154  kV substation under commercial operating condition [10]. In [11], a research study has been carried out to show the validity of the formula available in the literature against the measured earth resistance values at the field site. Ref. [12] has evaluated the role played by the foundations in a substation yard as grounding element and estimated the magnitude of the fault and leakage currents carried by the foundations. An artificial intelligent network approach is used for developing the relationship between the <b>ground</b> <b>resistance</b> and the vertically inserted electrode in the soil in [13]. Dimensional and grid electrodes are used for the measurement of <b>ground</b> <b>resistance</b> near a residential area in [14]. A methodological approach has developed for estimating the <b>ground</b> <b>resistance</b> of the several grounding system with various ground enhancing compounds using ANN [15]. Ref.

It is well-known that grounding systems are a key of high importance for the safe operation of electrical facilities, substations, transmission lines and, generally, electric power systems.
