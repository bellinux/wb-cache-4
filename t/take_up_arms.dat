5|$|Urban saw Alexios's request as a dual {{opportunity}} to cement Western Europe and reunite the Eastern Orthodox Church with the Roman Catholic Church under his rule. On 27 November 1095, Pope Urban II called together the Council of Clermont, and urged all those present to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms</b> {{under the sign}} of the Cross and launch an armed pilgrimage to recover Jerusalem and the East from the Muslims. The response in Western Europe was overwhelming.|$|E

5|$|As Police Commissioner Blamey {{defended the}} actions of the police during the 1928 Waterside Workers' Federation dispute, during which police opened fire, killing a {{striking}} worker who was also a Gallipoli veteran, and wounding several others. His treatment of the unionists was typical of his hard line anti-communist beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing governments were tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League of National Security. This was reportedly a response to the rise of communism in Australia. Its members stood ready to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms</b> to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.|$|E

5|$|On 27 November 1095, Urban II called {{together}} the Council of Clermont in France. There, amid {{a crowd of}} thousands {{who had come to}} hear his words, he urged all present to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms</b> under the banner of the Cross and launch a holy war to recover Jerusalem and the east from the 'infidel' Muslims. Indulgences were to be granted to all those {{who took part in the}} great enterprise. Many promised to carry out the Pope's command, and word of the Crusade soon spread across western Europe.|$|E
5|$|The false {{story of}} the {{execution}} of the Ho-Chunk prisoners, along with the incessant American trespassing, convinced some Ho-Chunks to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms</b> against the United States. The timing seemed right, since the evacuation of Fort Crawford appeared to be a sign of American weakness. Another grievance was the news that some Ho-Chunk women had been sexually assaulted by American riverboat crews along the Mississippi River, although this story, like the one about the executions, may have been a false rumor. The Ho-Chunks broke off diplomatic relations with the United States by not showing up for a scheduled treaty conference, and prepared for war.|$|E
5|$|Albanian {{intelligence}} groups informed Skanderbeg—the main {{leader of}} the revolt—that a large Ottoman army was preparing to march into Albania, the number of which was reported by some as being as high as 170,000. This army, however, {{is likely to have}} contained no more than 80,000 soldiers. Nevertheless, Murad marched his army into Monastir. Skanderbeg urgently called for material aid Venice. The answer, however, was negative. Instead, the only aid received came from the Neapolitans and the Ragusans. Nonetheless, Murad soon marched into Ohrid and Black Drin valley, traveling near Svetigrad. In response, Skanderbeg strengthened the garrisons of Krujë, Stellushi, Svetigrad, and Berat by ordering the populations around these fortress to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1929 he was {{appointed}} the marriage registrar at the sharia court in Haifa by the Waqf authorities in Jerusalem, a role {{that allowed him to}} tour the northern villages, whose inhabitants he encouraged to set up agricultural cooperatives. According to the American historian Edmund Burke, al-Qassam was:An individual deeply imbued with the Islamic social gospel and who was struck by the plight of Palestinian peasants and migrants. Al-Qassam's pastoral concern was linked to his moral outrage as a Muslim at {{the ways in which the}} old implicit social compact was being violated in the circumstances of British mandatory Palestine. This anger fueled a political radicalism that drove him eventually to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms</b> and marks him off from the Palestinian notable politicians.|$|E
5|$|In July 1778, Clark {{and about}} 175 men crossed the Ohio River at Fort Massac and marched to Kaskaskia, {{capturing}} {{it on the}} night of July 4 without firing their weapons. The next day, Captain Joseph Bowman and his company captured Cahokia in a similar fashion without firing a shot. The garrison at Vincennes along the Wabash River surrendered to Clark in August. Several other villages and British forts were subsequently captured, after most of the French-speaking and Indian inhabitants refused to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms</b> on behalf of the British. To counter Clark's advance, Hamilton recaptured the garrison at Vincennes, which the British called Fort Sackville, with a small force in December 1778.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a zone of buffer states, Sigismund I of Hungary tried to draw the neighboring Orthodox rulers under his own suzerainty by granting them estates in his kingdom. For example, Stefan Lazarević of Serbia received Satu Mare, Baia Mare and Baia Sprie in modern Romania, and Mircea I of Wallachia was granted Făgăraş. Sigismund I {{was also the first}} monarch who recognized, in 1419, the legislative competence of the Estates in Transylvania. On his initiative, their assembly declared that in case of an Ottoman attack, every third nobleman and every tenth serf would <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms.</b> Indeed, from 1420 Ottoman attacks occurred on an annual basis. In this period many Saxon churches, and later the Székely churches of the Ciuc region, were fortified, which gave local architecture a distinctive appearance.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{place after}} the events of Mega Man 4, Mega Man's brother and ally Proto Man un{{character}}istically leads a group of menacing robots in {{attacks on the world}} and kidnaps his own creator Dr. Light, leaving the title character little choice but to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms</b> in a fight against his once trusted sibling. Mega Man 5 carries over the same graphical style and action-platforming gameplay as the four preceding chapters in the series. The game introduces a new character, Beat, a robotic bird that the player can use as a weapon once a series of eight collectible letters are found. Artist Keiji Inafune had to re-illustrate the bosses several times but described his work as fun.|$|E
5|$|In June 1560, Michel de l'Hôpital was {{appointed}} Chancellor of France. He sought {{the support of}} France's constitutional bodies and worked closely with Catherine to defend {{the law in the}} face of the growing anarchy. Neither saw the need to punish Protestants who worshipped in private and did not <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms.</b> On 20 August 1560, Catherine and the chancellor advocated this policy to an assembly of notables at Fontainebleau. Historians regard the occasion as an early example of Catherine's statesmanship. Meanwhile, Condé raised an army and in autumn 1560 began attacking towns in the south. Catherine ordered him to court and had him imprisoned as soon as he arrived. He was tried in November, found guilty of offences against the crown, and sentenced to death. His life was saved by the illness and death of the king, as a result of an infection or an abscess in his ear.|$|E
5|$|Rupert's {{imprisonment}} {{became more}} relaxed {{on the advice}} of the Archduke Leopold, Ferdinand's younger brother, who met and grew to like Rupert. Rupert practised etching, played tennis, practised shooting, read military textbooks and was taken on accompanied hunting trips. He also entered into a romantic affair with Susan Kuffstein, the daughter of Count von Kuffstein, his gaoler. He received a present of a rare white poodle that Rupert called Boy, or sometimes Pudel, and which remained with him into the English Civil War. Despite attempts by a Franco-Swedish army to seize Linz and free Rupert, his release was ultimately negotiated through Leopold and the Empress Maria Anna; in exchange for a commitment never again to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms</b> against the Emperor, Rupert would be released. Rupert formally kissed the Emperor's hand at the end of 1641, turned down a final offer of an Imperial command and left Germany for England.|$|E

5|$|The {{mainstay}} of its economy was sugar, grown on cane plantations worked by slaves. The {{sale of the}} crop in Britain enjoyed preferential terms. There were 2,571 declared slaves working on 68 plantations in Essequibo, and 1,648 slaves in Demerara in 1762. These numbers {{were known to be}} much understated, as the slave headcount was the basis of taxation. By 1769, there were 3,986 declared slaves for Essequibo's 92 plantations and 5,967 for Demerara's 206 plantations. The slave labour was in short supply and expensive due to the trading monopoly of the DWIC, and smuggling from Barbados was rife. Dutch colonists ensured white dominance over their growing slave population through the collaboration of indigenous natives, who strongly resisted white domination but could also be relied upon to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms</b> against any Spanish incursions. When slaves rose up in Berbice in 1763, natives blocked the border to prevent the disruption from spreading into Demerara.|$|E
5|$|The story follows Madoc's journey as {{they travel}} West again, contending with {{problems}} such as storms and dissent among the crew. Eventually, they reach America and are received by the natives. Madoc takes {{on one of the}} natives, Lincoya, as his guide when they begin to explore the area of the Mississippi River. As they continue to travel, they soon come to Aztlan, the original homeland of the Aztec nation, and Madoc discovers that the Aztecs require human sacrifices for their gods. Madoc decides to interfere with tribal affairs and stop two children from being taken by the Aztecs to be sacrificed. Following this, he encourages a peaceful tribe, the Hoamen, to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms</b> against the Aztecs. To further protect the Hoamen, Madoc goes to the Aztec capital to deal with their king. While there, he is shown by the king how great the Aztecs are and how no one could stand against them. Madoc witnesses among the buildings and monuments piles of skulls and corpses along with other horrific scenes.|$|E
5|$|Events at Ulm {{were now}} {{reaching}} a conclusion. On 15 October Ney's troops successfully charged the Michelsberg encampments {{and on the}} 16th the French began to bombard Ulm itself. Austrian morale was at a low point and Mack {{began to realize that}} there was little hope of rescue. On 17 October Napoleon's emissary, Ségur, signed a convention with Mack in which the Austrians agreed to surrender on 25 October if no aid came by that date. Gradually, however, Mack heard of the capitulations at Heidenheim and Neresheim and agreed to surrender five days before schedule on 20 October. Fifteen hundred troops from the Austrian garrison managed to escape, {{but the vast majority of}} the Austrian force marched out on 21 October and laid down their arms without incident, all with the Grande Armée drawn up in a vast semicircle observing the capitulation (see infobox picture). The officers were permitted to leave, pending their signatures on a parole in which they agreed not to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms</b> against France until they were exchanged. More than ten general officers were included in this agreement, including Mack, Johann von Klenau, Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, Prince Liechtenstein, and Ignaz Gyulai.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the late Republic, {{formerly}} authoritative institutions lost their credibility and authority. For example, the Sullan reforms to the Senate strongly split the aristocratic class between those who stayed in the city and those who rose to high office abroad, further increasing class divides between Romans, even at the highest levels. Furthermore, the dominance of the military in the late Republic, along with stronger ties between a general and his troops, caused by their longer terms of service together and the troops' reliance on that general to provide for their retirements, along with an obstructionist central government, meant a huge number of malcontent soldiers willing to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms</b> against the state. Adding in the institutionalisation of violence as a means to obstruct or force political change (e.g. the deaths of the Gracchi and Sulla's dictatorship, respectively), the Republic was caught in an ever more violent and anarchic struggle between the Senate, assemblies at Rome, and the promagistrates. It would only be resolved by civil war, a war which the promagistrate governors and their troops would win, and in doing so, collapse the Republic.|$|E
5|$|The Combine's first {{appearance}} is in Half-Life 2. Through {{the early stages}} of the game, Combine Civil Protection units pursue Gordon Freeman through City 17 after he accidentally reveals his presence to Wallace Breen. Due to Freeman's actions in Half-Life, Breen sees Freeman as a major threat. As Freeman escapes the city, Civil Protection units raid the resistance base of Black Mesa East and capture resistance leader Eli Vance, who is transferred to holding facilities at Nova Prospekt. Freeman and Vance's daughter Alyx break into the facility to rescue him, but Eli Vance is teleported to the Combine Citadel by double agent Judith Mossman. However, the strike against Nova Prospekt is seen as the start of a revolution by the citizens of Earth, who <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms</b> against the Combine. In response, Combine Overwatch are deployed to City 17, and heavy street fighting takes place. Freeman manages to infiltrate the Citadel but is captured and taken to Breen. Mossman allows Freeman to break free of his captivity, and Breen flees to the Citadel's trans-dimensional teleporter, intent on escape. However, Freeman destroys the teleporter's reactor before Breen can escape, causing a large explosion that destroys the top of the Citadel.|$|E
5|$|The Maltese {{position}} {{had already}} been severely weakened by {{the large number of}} Frenchmen who were part of the Order, who refused en masse to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>arms</b> against Bonaparte. The French Revolution had already significantly reduced the Knights' income and their ability to put up serious resistance to Bonaparte was seriously compromised by a lack of resources. On 12 June, Bonaparte finally announced to his troops the destination of the expedition and on 19 June he sailed for Alexandria, initially steering east towards Crete. He left behind Vaubois and 4,000 men to maintain Malta as a base to control the Central Mediterranean. To ensure that news of the impending attack on Egypt did not spread ahead of the fleet, Brueys ordered that any merchant ships that sighted the convoy during the passage were to be seized and detained until his force had reached Alexandria. On 26 June, the British gained the first firm intelligence of French intentions, when the frigate HMS Seahorse under Captain Edward Foote encountered and captured the French frigate Sensible, which was returning to Toulon from Malta with a cargo of treasure and wounded soldiers, including General d'Hilliers. From these prisoners the destination of the French fleet was discovered and Seahorse, joined shortly afterwards by Terpsichore, sailed in pursuit, hoping to encounter Nelson.|$|E
