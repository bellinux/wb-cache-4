500|$|Braille was {{determined}} to invent a system of reading and writing that could bridge the gap in communication between <b>the</b> <b>sighted</b> and the blind. In his own words: [...] "Access to communication in the widest sense is access to knowledge, and that is vitally important for us if we [...] are not to go on being despised or patronized by condescending sighted people. We do not need pity, nor {{do we need to}} be reminded we are vulnerable. We must be treated as equals – and communication is the way this can be brought about." ...|$|E

50|$|To achieve natural {{point of}} aim, the shooter settles into {{position}} while not looking through <b>the</b> <b>sights.</b> Some shooters actually close their eyes, but this can upset the natural maintenance of balance because the brain uses visual cues to help stay in balance. The shooter looks through <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> only after ensuring the position is comfortable and the firearm is {{resting in the}} stance with minimal muscle tension. If <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> are not resting on the desired point of impact, the shooter adjusts the position by repeating the same steps until <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> rest on <b>the</b> target. After achieving a comfortable and natural position, if <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> {{are not on the}} target, the shooter adjusts his stance (moves his feet) until <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> are on target. The arm, head and body position do not change; when standing only the feet are moved to bring <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> onto target.|$|R
500|$|The {{handcrafted}} Haüy books {{all came}} in uncomfortable sizes and weights for children. They were laboriously constructed, very fragile, and expensive to obtain: when Haüy's school first opened, {{it had a}} total of three books. Nonetheless, Haüy promoted their use with zeal. To him, the books presented a system which would be readily approved by educators and indeed they seemed – to <b>the</b> <b>sighted</b> – to offer the best achievable results. Braille and his schoolmates, however, could detect all too well the books' crushing limitations. Nonetheless, Haüy's efforts still provided a breakthrough achievement – the recognition of the sense of touch as a workable strategy for sightless reading. Haüy's only personal limitation was that he was [...] "talking to the fingers with the language of the eye." ...|$|E

2500|$|Starting June 26 and June 27, {{newspapers}} {{first began}} using the terms [...] "flying saucer" [...] and [...] "flying disk" [...] (or [...] "disc") to describe <b>the</b> <b>sighted</b> objects.

Jerome Clark cites a 1970 study by Herbert Strentz, who reviewed U.S. newspaper accounts of the Arnold UFO sighting, {{and concluded that the}} term was probably due to an editor or headline writer: the body of the early Arnold news stories did not use the term [...] "flying saucer" [...] or [...] "flying disc." [...] However, earlier stories did in fact credit Arnold with using terms such as [...] "saucer", [...] "disk", and [...] "pie-pan" [...] in describing the shape.

2500|$|Ileana Sánchez {{invented a}} book for the blind that brings {{together}} art and braille. Ms. Sanchez used a new technique called TechnoPrint and TechnoBraille. Rather than punch through heavy paper to create the raised dots of the Braille alphabet for the blind, these techniques apply an epoxy to the page to create not only raised dots, but raised images with texture. The epoxy melds with the page, becoming part of it, so that you can't scrape it off with your fingernail. The images are raised so that a blind person can feel the artwork and in color, not just to attract <b>the</b> <b>sighted</b> family who will read the book with blind siblings or children, {{but also for the}} blind themselves. The book [...] "Art & the Alphabet, A Tactile Experience" [...] is co-written with Rebecca McGinnis of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Met has already incorporated the book into their Access program.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>sight</b> {{head was}} mounted {{on top of}} a square platform, with screw {{adjustments}} {{that could be used to}} level the platform.

2500|$|There is {{significant}} {{controversy over the}} presence of Eastern Cougars in the U.P. Historically, {{the last of the}} species, or subspecies, was extirpated near Newberry in 1906, although there have been sightings of the creatures over the years since. These reports increased in number over {{the first decade of the}} 21st century. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) formed a four-person team to investigate sightings in the state. The biologists with the DNRE currently do not believe that there is a breeding population anywhere in the state, rather that <b>the</b> <b>sighted</b> animals are visitors to the state. As late as January 2007, the DNRE's official position was that no cougars lived in Michigan. Several residents in the state disagree with both current and previous positions on the part of the DNRE. Researchers at Central Michigan University and the Michigan Wildlife Conservancy in 2006 published the findings of a study using DNA analysis of fecal samples taken in the Upper and Lower peninsulas that showed the presence of cougars at the time. These results were disputed in a second journal article in 2007 by other researchers from Eastern Michigan University and the U.S. Forest Service. A citizen's group, the Michigan Citizens for Cougar Recognition (MCCR), independently tracked sightings and in 2009 listed Delta County as the location with the greatest number of reports in the state. The DNRE verified five sets of tracks and two trail camera photos in Delta, Chippewa, Marquette, and Menominee counties since 2008. DNRE officials acknowledge that there are cougars in the UP, but not elsewhere in the state. Critics of the DNRE's position on the species, including the founder of the MCCR, say that the department is attempting to [...] "avoid paying for a cougar management program".|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Drift <b>Sight</b> {{was mounted}} {{to the side}} of the {{aircraft}} using two brackets at the front and back of <b>the</b> <b>sights.</b> <b>The</b> forward bracket had a pivot point, and the rear a screw jack that rotated <b>the</b> entire <b>sighting</b> system up or down around the front bracket's pivot. This allowed fine adjustment of the levelling of <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> during flight to account for changes in trim; after making these adjustments the system was locked in position using wingnuts.

50|$|Telescopic sights for {{tanks were}} adopted before World War II, and these sights usually had {{a means of}} aiming off for target {{movement}} and graticules marked for different ranges.
