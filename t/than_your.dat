It {{allowed the}} player {{to act as}} the General Manager of the Raw or Smackdown brands (or ECW brand in WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2008). After {{choosing}} a brand, and selecting {{to participate in the}} WWE Draft, or using a default roster, you then start a calendar year of hiring and managing Superstar and Divas, booking matches, establishing rivalries, and other options to try and win WWE fans to support your brand. You must manage finances, contract or release Superstars & try to make better matches <b>than</b> <b>your</b> rival brand. At {{the end of the year}} at WrestleMania, Vince McMahon will give The General Manager of the Year award to the show that was able to hold the most fans.|$|E

25|$|Tinder lights {{easily and}} is used to start an {{enduring}} campfire.

A few decent natural tinders are birch bark, cedar bark, and fatwood, where available; followed by dead, dry pine needles or grass; a more comprehensive list is given in the article on tinder. Though not natural, steel wool makes excellent tinder and can be started with steel and flint, or a 9 volt battery without difficulty.|$|E
25|$|If, therefore, it {{is claimed}} that your race {{is doomed to}} {{economic}} inferiority, you may confidently look {{to the home of}} your ancestors and say, that you have set out to recover for the colored people the strength that was their own before they set foot on the shores of this continent.

500|$|Dark Forces {{gameplay}} {{has been}} described as [...] "challenging" [...] and has generally received praise. Ron Dulin, reviewing the game for GameSpot, highlights the implementation of puzzles within levels: [...] "The levels are diverse and ingenious, with plenty of creative obstacles standing between you and your goal. While they can be occasionally frustrating, Dark Forces diverse gameplay requirements make this title more mentally challenging <b>than</b> <b>your</b> average key hunt." [...] The graphics and sound were both praised as helping to immerse the player in the environment.|$|E
500|$|However, some of {{the reviews}} were more negative. PALGN's Jeremy Jastrzab opined that [...] "Darkwatch gives vampires, undead, cowboys and plenty of bullets to fire. But that's about it. Otherwise, Darkwatch is a fairly {{standard}} affair that's worth a rental." [...] According to Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, [...] "Darkwatch doesn't amount to much more <b>than</b> <b>your</b> run-of-the mill first-person shooter." [...] Eurogamer's Martin Coxall called it [...] "a generic and quickly tiresome shooter, with a contrived premise which, unfortunately, does nothing to elevate it." ...|$|E

500|$|Keeping {{with the}} custom at the time, Hancock did not {{campaign}} personally, but stayed at his post at Fort Columbus on Governors Island, in New York Harbor {{and met with}} visitors there (as General Grant had in 1868, Hancock remained on active duty throughout the campaign). Both parties' campaigns began {{with a focus on}} the candidates rather than the issues. Democratic newspapers attacked the Republican nominee, James A. Garfield of Ohio, over rumors of corruption and self-dealing in the Crédit Mobilier affair, among others. Republicans characterized Hancock as uninformed on the issues, and some of his former comrades-in-arms gave critical speeches regarding his character. Democrats never made clear what about their victory would improve the nation; Hancock biographer David M. Jordan later characterized their message as simply [...] "our man is better <b>than</b> <b>your</b> man".|$|E

500|$|Of {{the updated}} 2006 version, Variety stated that [...] "..the breezy one-hour show is equal parts adorable and creepy, hilarious and unsettling, making it way more {{compelling}} <b>than</b> <b>your</b> average holiday entertainment." [...] The Boston Globe also reviewed the 2006 {{edition of the}} play, and its review spent more time giving background {{on some of the}} cast and crew, particularly writer Kyle Jarrow, stating that [...] "..Jarrow has created a musical about L. Ron Hubbard that is, in its own sardonic way, much more funny and touching than any of Cruise's diatribes against Ritalin." [...] The New York Sun described the production as an: [...] "ingenious musical account of L. Ron Hubbard's life and times", and compared the discomfort produced by watching the piece to that produced by the 2006 documentary Jesus Camp.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{graphics}} and sounds were {{also met with}} muted enthusiasm. Kasavin complained of Deus Exs relatively sub-par graphics, blaming them on the game's [...] "incessantly dark industrial environments." [...] GamePro reviewer Chris Patterson {{took the time to}} note that despite being [...] "solid acoustically," [...] Deus Ex had moments of weakness. He poked fun at JC's [...] "Joe Friday, 'just the facts, deadpan," [...] and the [...] "truly cheesy accents" [...] of minor characters in Hong Kong and New York City. IGN called the graphics [...] "blocky", adding that [...] "the animation is stiff, and the dithering is just plain awful in some spots," [...] referring to the limited capabilities of the Unreal Engine used to design the game. the website, later on, stated that [...] "overall Deus Ex certainly looks better <b>than</b> <b>your</b> average game." ...|$|E

500|$|After the 2001 {{inauguration of}} Harvard University's twenty-seventh president, Lawrence Summers, Lewis and Summers came into {{conflict}} over {{the direction of}} the College and its educational philosophy. Lewis, for example, emphasized the importance of extracurricular pursuits, advising incoming freshmen that [...] "flexibility in your schedule, unstructured time in your day, and evenings spent with your friends rather <b>than</b> <b>your</b> books are all, in a larger sense, essential for your education", while Summers complained of an insufficiently intellectual [...] "Camp Harvard" [...] and admonished students that [...] "You are here to work, and your business here is to learn." [...] After Lewis issued what The Harvard Crimson called [...] "a scathing indictment of the view that increasing intellectual rigor ought to be the [...] priority"pointing out that prospective employers show less interest in grades than in personal qualities built outside the classroomhe was peremptorily removed as dean in March 2003.|$|E
500|$|Combat {{and the new}} {{gameplay}} mechanics were well-received, with Dale North of Destructoid saying [...] "God of War {{has never}} looked or played better than this", and Xav de Matos of Joystiq commenting that the combat is simpler than in God of War III, and rarely required much adjustment. Opinions on difficulty varied; Simmons felt {{that most of the}} gameplay was balanced, and that Ascension [...] "is probably the easiest" [...] in the series, but both he and Hollander Cooper of GamesRadar commented that some areas, such as the Trials of Archimedes, were too difficult. Simmons felt that in some sections, the many enemies made dying feel [...] "cheap and frustrating", and in Cooper's opinion, some points in the game [...] " [...] your patience, rather <b>than</b> <b>your</b> skills—including one [...] that's easily the most difficult section in any God of War game to date, for all the wrong reasons".|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{identified}} himself as a poet and, in November 1734, applied to Edward Cave {{to work on the}} poetry reviews for The Gentleman's Magazine. In a letter written under the name S.

In particular, Johnson suggested removing the magazine's [...] "low Jests" [...] and [...] "awkward Buffoonery" [...] and then replacing them with poems, inscriptions, and [...] "short literary Dissertations in Latin or English" [...] written by himself. Cave did not accept Johnson's proposal to write a column, but he did employ Johnson occasionally to work on minor aspects of the periodical.|$|E
