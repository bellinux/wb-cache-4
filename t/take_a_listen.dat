Roth thought that one of the onlookers of such a scene would probably shout [...] "go ahead and jump". Roth bounced this suggestion off Hostler who agreed it was good.

For a variety of takes on the closing ceremony, see Danwei’s wrap-up. 2. In case you missed them, here are Xinhua’s pictures of a sweaty President Bushchatting with the eventual gold medalists in women’s beach volleyball. 3. Mary Beard at TLS wrote two recent pieces on the Olympics that may be of interest–both written from a classicist’s perspective, the first beginning from the premise of how London will possibly live up to Beijing’s show, while the second a tongue-in-cheek reflection on Greek Olympic traditions. 4. For those tracking superstitions in 2008 (like the earthquake premonitions and the Olympic harbingers of doom), Shanghaiist is keeping up on connections between the earthquake and the Chinese medal count. 5. After all the mentions in the media {{over the last few weeks}} of the massive mobilization of humans necessary for the Olympic performances (a mobilization made possible, commentators implied or sometimes said, because China is an autocratic regime), Jamie Metzl of the Asia Society urges in FEER that liberal democracies need to go toe-to-toe with Beijing’s technocrats and prove that liberal democracies can also put on a good show.

40|$|Watching English-spoken {{films with}} {{subtitles}} {{is becoming increasingly}} popular throughout the world. One reason for this trend {{is the assumption that}} perceptual learning of the sounds of a foreign language, English, will improve perception skills in non-English speakers. Yet, solid proof for this is scarce. In order to test the potential learning effects derived from watching subtitled media, a group of intermediate Spanish students of English as a foreign language watched a 1 h-long episode of a TV drama in its original English version, with English, Spanish or no subtitles overlaid. Before and after the viewing, participants <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>listening</b> and vocabulary test to evaluate their speech perception and vocabulary acquisition in English, plus a final plot comprehension test. The results of the listening skills tests revealed that after watching the English subtitled version, participants improved these skills significantly more than after watching the Spanish subtitled or no-subtitles versions. The vocabulary test showed no reliable differences between subtitled conditions. Finally, as one could expect, plot comprehension was best under native, Spanish subtitles. These learning effects with just 1 hour exposure might have major implications with longer exposure times.

The participants, 226 university-level students from a Flemish university, watched three short French clips in one of three conditions: the control group watched the clips without captions (N = 70), the second group had fully captioned clips (N = 81), the third group had keyword captioned clips (N = 75). After each clip, all participants <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension test, which consisted of global and detailed questions. To answer the detailed questions, participants had access to an audio passage of the corresponding clip. At the end of the experiment, participants completed a questionnaire and open-ended survey questions about their perception of captions. Our findings revealed that the full captioning group outperformed both the no captioning and the keyword captioning group on the global comprehension questions. However, no difference was found between the keyword captioning and the no captioning group. Results of the detailed comprehension questions (with audio) revealed no differences between the three conditions. A content-analysis approach to the questionnaire indicated that learners’ perceived need for full captions is strong. Participants consider captions useful for speech decoding and meaning-making processes. Surprisingly, keyword captions were considered highly distracting. These findings suggest that full rather than keyword captioning should be considered when proposing video-based listening comprehension activities to L 2 learners. status: publishe...|$|R
