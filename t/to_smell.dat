5|$|King {{vultures}}, which {{lack the}} ability <b>to</b> <b>smell</b> carrion, follow the greater yellow-headed vultures to carcasses, where the king vulture tears open {{the skin of}} the dead animal. This allows the smaller greater yellow-headed vulture access to food, as it does not have a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of mutual dependence between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both turkey vultures and king vultures, due to their larger size.|$|E
5|$|The procellariids are small- to {{medium-sized}} seabirds. The largest, {{the giant}} petrels with a wingspan of , {{are almost as}} large as albatrosses; the smallest, such as the fairy prion have a wingspan of , are slightly bigger than the diving petrels. There are no obvious differences between the sexes, although females tend to be slighter. Like all Procellariiformes, the procellariids have a characteristic tubular nasal passage used for olfaction. This ability <b>to</b> <b>smell</b> helps to locate patchily distributed prey at sea and may also help locate nesting colonies. The plumage of the procellariids is usually dull, with greys, blues, blacks and browns being the usual colours, although some species have striking patterns (such as the Cape petrel).|$|E
5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until {{the time came to}} add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said <b>to</b> <b>smell</b> and taste like molasses.|$|E
50|$|Menthyl acetate is {{a natural}} {{monoterpene}} which contributes <b>to</b> the <b>smell</b> and flavor of peppermint. It is the acetate ester of menthol. Menthyl acetate constitutes 3-5% of the volatile oil of mentha piperita, contributing <b>to</b> its <b>smell</b> and flavour.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{essential}} oils in pregnancy {{is not recommended}} due to inadequate published evidence to demonstrate evidence of safety. Pregnant women often report an abnormal sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>smells</b> and taste, and essential oils can cause irritation and nausea.|$|R
2500|$|The {{anterior}} insula processes a person's {{sense of}} disgust both <b>to</b> <b>smells</b> and <b>to</b> {{the sight of}} contamination and mutilation — even when just imagining the experience.

25|$|Chemical senses {{include the}} use of chemoreceptors, related to taste and smell, {{affecting}} mating, habitat selection, feeding and parasite-host relationships. Taste is usually located on the mouthparts of the insect but in some insects, such as bees, wasps and ants, taste organs can also be found on the antennae. Taste organs can also be found on the tarsi of moths, butterflies and flies. Olfactory sensilla enable insects <b>to</b> <b>smell</b> and are usually found in the antennae. Chemoreceptor sensitivity related <b>to</b> <b>smell</b> in some substances, is very high and some insects can detect particular odours that are at low concentrations miles from their original source.|$|E
50|$|A smelling {{screen is}} a type of digital scent {{technology}} that combines a display screen, similar to a television or computer monitor, with an odor emitting device capable of pinpointing the <b>smell</b> <b>to</b> a specific portion of the displayed image. It {{is believed to be the}} first device <b>to</b> incorporate <b>smells</b> into a television screen, though certainly not the first <b>to</b> synchronize <b>smell</b> with a displayed image (see Digital scent technology).|$|R

25|$|The {{causes of}} ORS are unknown. It {{is thought that}} {{significant}} negative experiences may trigger the development of ORS. These have been considered as two types: key traumatic experiences related <b>to</b> <b>smell,</b> and life stressors present when the condition developed but which were unrelated <b>to</b> <b>smell.</b> In one review, 85% of reported cases had traumatic, smell-related experiences, and 17% of cases had stress factors unrelated <b>to</b> <b>smell.</b> Reported smell-related experiences usually revolve around family members, friends, co-workers, peers or other people making comments about an odor from the person, which causes embarrassment and shame. Examples include accusation of flatulence during a religious ceremony, or being bullied for flatulence such at school, accidental urination in class, announcements about a passenger needing to use deodorant over speaker by a driver on public transport, sinusitis which caused a bad taste in the mouth, mockery about a fish odor from a finger which had been inserted into the person's vagina {{in the context of}} a sexual assault, and revulsion about menarche and brother's sexual intimacy. It has been suggested that a proportion of such reported experiences may not have been real, but rather early symptom of ORS (i.e. referential thoughts). Examples of non smell-related stressful periods include guilt due to a romantic affair, being left by a partner, violence in school, family illness when growing up (e.g. cancer), and bullying.|$|E
25|$|Shahid Afridi, {{standing}} {{in as the}} Pakistani Captain, received a two T20 international match ban for ball-tampering in a match against Australia in January 2010. He was caught on camera biting the cricket ball in a bizarre attempt to readjust the seam of the ball. The ball was eventually replaced. He reported to Hindustan Times {{that he was trying}} <b>to</b> <b>smell</b> the ball but he pleaded guilty for ball tampering.|$|E
25|$|The soul is {{sometimes}} plainly {{perceived to be}} but one in its own sensorium, while the body is understood to be all that so variously modifies impressions as to make them in the one instance smell, in another taste, another sight, and thus on, ad finem. Thus the hasheesh-eater {{knows what it is}} to be burned by salt fire, <b>to</b> <b>smell</b> colors, to see sounds, and, much more frequently, to see feelings.|$|E

50|$|The product, {{initially}} {{marketed as}} a way to get rid of unpleasant smells, sold poorly until P&G realised that people become accustomed <b>to</b> <b>smells</b> in their own homes, and stop noticing them even when they are overpowering (like the smell of several cats in a single household). The marketing then switched to linking it <b>to</b> pleasant <b>smells</b> and good cleaning habits instead, which resulted in a massive increase in sales. Only after the product became well established in the marketplace did the marketing go back to emphasising odor elimination properties as well.|$|R
25|$|Recent {{experiments}} with the Gambian giant pouched rat, {{also known as}} the African giant pouched rat, have indicated that it has the required sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>smell,</b> can be trained reliably with food-reward incentives, and is typically too small to set off the mines. These rats also offer a local solution to many African countries because they are indigenous to East Africa. These rats are trained by a non-profit, research organization called APOPO and are called HeroRATs.|$|E
25|$|Pure {{water is}} usually {{described}} as tasteless and odorless, although humans have specific sensors that {{can feel the}} presence of water in their mouths, and frogs {{are known to be}} able <b>to</b> <b>smell</b> it. However, water from ordinary sources (including bottled mineral water) usually has many dissolved substances, that may give it varying tastes and odors. Humans and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the potability of water by avoiding water that is too salty or putrid.|$|E
25|$|When closed, a well-maintained bin is odorless; when opened, {{it should}} have little smell if any smell is present, it is earthy. Worms require gaseous oxygen. Oxygen can be {{provided}} by airholes in the bin, occasional stirring of bin contents, and removal of some bin contents if they become too deep or too wet. If decomposition becomes anaerobic from excess wet feedstock added to the bin, or the layers of food waste have become too deep, the bin will begin <b>to</b> <b>smell</b> of ammonia.|$|E

25|$|The kappa is {{typically}} depicted as roughly humanoid {{in form and}} {{about the size of}} a child. Its scaly reptilian skin ranges in color from green to yellow or blue. Kappa supposedly inhabit the ponds and rivers of Japan, and have various features to aid them in this environment, such as webbed hands and feet. They are sometimes said <b>to</b> <b>smell</b> like fish and they can swim like them. The expression kappa no kawa nagare ("a kappa drowning in a river") conveys the idea that even experts make mistakes.|$|E
25|$|On 23 February 2012, the {{advocate}} depute led evidence from a Lothian and Borders Police constable {{who told the}} court that they had {{enlisted the help of}} specially trained cadaver dogs from South Yorkshire Police to search the offices where David Gilroy and Suzanne Pilley worked. The dogs were specially trained <b>to</b> <b>smell</b> for blood and human remains. The court was told that the dogs, springer spaniels, had identified three areas of interest; one in the basement area of the offices, and two in the boot of David Gilroy's silver Vauxhall Vectra.|$|E
25|$|Various organic {{diseases}} {{may cause}} parosmias (distortion {{of the sense}} of smell). Also, since smell and taste are intimately linked senses, disorders of gustation (e.g. dysgeusia- taste dysfunction) can present as a complaint related <b>to</b> <b>smell,</b> and vice versa. These conditions, collectively termed chemosensory dysfunctions, are many and varied, and they may trigger a person to complain of an odor than is not present, however the diagnostic criteria for ORS require the exclusion of any such causes. They include pathology of the right hemisphere of the brain, substance abuse, arteriovenous malformations in the brain, and temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E

50|$|Fish, too, have a {{well-developed}} {{sense of}} smell, {{even though they}} inhabit an aquatic environment. Salmon utilize their sense of <b>smell</b> <b>to</b> identify and return to their home stream waters.

Many fishes use the sense of <b>smell</b> <b>to</b> identify mating partners or to alert {{to the presence of}} food.|$|R
50|$|The Pachón Navarro is a Spanish hunting dog (also known as: Nafarroako eper txakur, Perdiguero Navarro, Pachón de Victoria, Navarra Pointer) {{which has}} the unusual feature of a split or double nose. It was {{believed}} that this unusual nose gives it extra sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>smells,</b> a primary reason it was chosen as a hunting dog. Today {{it is known that}} this feature is only a cosmetic difference.|$|R
25|$|The Western {{honey bee}} {{is the third}} insect to have its genome mapped, and is unusual in having very few transposons. According to the {{scientists}} who analyzed its genetic code, the western honey bee originated in Africa and spread to Eurasia in two ancient migrations. They have also discovered {{that the number of}} genes in the honey bees related <b>to</b> <b>smell</b> outnumber those for taste. The genome sequence revealed several groups of genes, particularly the genes related to circadian rhythms, were closer to vertebrates than other insects. Genes related to enzymes that control other genes were also vertebrate-like.|$|E
25|$|Earlier on, in {{the third}} segment, Mrs. Potts' Party, the Beast makes several cameos {{sleeping}} in his bed in the West Wing. Dialogue between Lumiere and Cogsworth shows that {{he had spent the}} entire previous night mending leaks in the castle roof, and is still resting. An argument between Lumiere and Cogsworth about Mrs. Potts' favourite flowers lead to them having to hide several bunches of flowers around the Beast's bed. At one point, the Beast begins <b>to</b> <b>smell</b> one of the flowers and almost wakes up, but it is removed just in time, and he falls asleep again.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the 1980s, the {{perfection}} of the extractor hood allowed an open kitchen again, integrated more or less with the living room without causing the whole apartment or house <b>to</b> <b>smell.</b> Before that, only a few earlier experiments, typically in newly built upper-middle-class family homes, had open kitchens. Examples are Frank Lloyd Wright's House Willey (1934) and House Jacobs (1936). Both had open kitchens, with high ceilings (up to the roof) and were aired by skylights. The extractor hood {{made it possible to}} build open kitchens in apartments, too, where both high ceilings and skylights were not possible.|$|E
