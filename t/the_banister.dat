25|$|The mainstaircase was {{flanked by}} smooth, {{variegated}} marble columns in antis. Ten marble steps {{lead up to}} a landing. In the east wall of the intermediate landing is a fountain. The stairs diverge at the intermediate landing, with nine more steps on {{the north and south}} leading to the second floor landing. The stringer, risers, and treads are all made of marble. <b>The</b> <b>banister</b> is of cast iron in a rinceau and cartouche pattern, with a handrail encased in red velvet.|$|E
25|$|The main {{stairwell}} {{is located}} in the main courtyard opposite the nereid fountain. The dogs that adorn <b>the</b> <b>banister</b> of the main stairwell and the mascarons over the main doorway have an Oriental look to them, which was not common in such residences. Partly because of this, it has been speculated that the wood and the labor used to create parts of the house were of Philippine origin. However, both the work and the wood are native to Mexico, although the wood is not very common.|$|E
25|$|Historic Jordan House in West Des Moines is {{a stately}} Victorian home built in 1850 {{and added to}} in 1870 by the first white settler in West Des Moines, James C. Jordan. Completely refurbished, this mansion was once part of the Underground Railroad and today houses 16 period rooms, a {{railroad}} museum, West Des Moines community history, and a museum dedicated to the Underground Railroad in Iowa. In 1893 Jordan's daughter Eda was sliding down <b>the</b> <b>banister</b> when she fell off and broke her neck. She died two days later, and her ghost is reputed to haunt the house.|$|E
5|$|Banister met his wife, Karen, {{while they}} were {{students}} at the University of Houston. Karen worked as a teacher at Clear Lake High School in Houston. <b>The</b> <b>Banisters</b> have two children: Alexandra and Jacob. Alexandra is a college volleyball player. <b>The</b> <b>Banisters</b> reside in Keller, Texas.|$|R

25|$|The old City Hall {{was built}} in 1906–1907 after the {{construction}} plans of Komor Marcell and Jakab Dezső. The entrance area, including the corridor and the staircase leading {{to the first floor}}, is the most representative in this regard. The ribbed stellar vaults that cover this area were inspired by Gothic architecture. The vaults are supported by columns with composite caps, and the keystone is a large floral shape which includes the lighting appliance. The vaults are painted with spiraling vegetal motifs. Elements of the front hall include the stone bench with its legs shaped as those of an animal and with wing-shaped handles. Its shell-shaped, golden back has a shield flanked by two volutes on its upper side. Features of the monumental staircase leading to the first floor include the upper side of <b>the</b> <b>banister</b> resembling a slithering animal or a wave. The exterior decoration is simpler and is based on Hungarian-Székely folk motives made of polychromatic ceramics. The ground floor is marked by a solid, embossed pedestal. Windows with large openings tend to be predominant in the façade. The three semicircular windows in the middle area of the façade are those of the honor hall that has a double elevation with respect to the other rooms. The glass paintings which illustrated Gábor Bethlen, Francis II Rákóczi, Lajos Kossuth, Ferenc Deák and Franz Joseph I of Austria are missing from the halls.|$|E
500|$|Hogg and {{her younger}} {{brothers}} were rambunctious. She recalled that they particularly enjoyed sliding down the banisters in the Governor's Mansion. Hogg's parents allowed this to continue until Thomas cut his chin, after which Jim Hogg nailed tacks along {{the center of the}} railing to curb the activity through fear of bloodied posteriors; the holes from the tacks remained visible in <b>the</b> <b>banister</b> for many decades after the Hogg family moved from the home. Hogg's mother attempted to teach her ladylike skills such as needlework, but Hogg claimed that she [...] "never had the patience to succeed". Her mother also encouraged Hogg to learn German. Hogg and her siblings were frequently taken to the Millet Opera House in Austin to enjoy the performances.|$|E
500|$|Hard Boiled took 123 days to shoot. Although Woo {{told his}} cast {{that the film}} would be more gritty and not as stylish as his {{previous}} films, Hard Boiled became more stylish as the filming began. The tea house sequence in the film was shot before the script was written. The crew found that the tea house {{was going to be}} torn down and decided to film a scene there. Woo saw the staircase in the tea house, and thought about a scene where a character would come shooting down gun smugglers while sliding down <b>the</b> <b>banister.</b> The tea house sequence was shot in around a week's time and was choreographed by Woo and Philip Kwok. It was shot with interruptions from many local triads in the area asking for protection money, and residents complaining about the noise.|$|E

60|$|So {{he kissed}} her again. 'Sam!' said Mr. Pickwick, calling over <b>the</b> <b>banisters.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{knocking}} continued; a door upstairs opened, and Margaret spoke over <b>the</b> <b>banisters.</b>|$|R
500|$|Paige {{transferred}} to the New York production of Sunset Boulevard to make her Broadway debut at the Minskoff Theatre on 12 September 1996, staying with the show until it closed on 22 March 1997. On the Sunset Boulevard set in Broadway, the staircase steps had to be raised six inches (15cm) {{in order to accommodate}} Paige's short stature, or it would have been hard to see her behind <b>the</b> <b>banister.</b> [...] Paige was welcomed to the Broadway stage with a long standing ovation from the audience, and received largely positive reviews for her New York performance as Norma Desmond: [...] "The lush sound and the sheer power of her voice are, to put it simply, incredible", wrote one critic, whilst another said [...] "Her voice has great range, remarkable clarity and emotional force". Paige was the first Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard to sing one of the show's key songs, [...] "With One Look", which she did first at Lloyd Webber's wedding to Madeleine Gurdon, although at the time the song was called [...] "Just One Glance". Lloyd Webber noted, regarding Paige's performance of one of the show's other prominent songs, [...] "As If We Never Said Goodbye", that it was [...] "as good, if not the best, of anything I've ever heard of mine". [...] Regarding the key lyric in the song, [...] "This world's waited long enough. I've come home at last", Paige had sought to change the way the melody was sung, despite being fully aware of Lloyd-Webber's fastidious tendencies. To her, the moment was not exploited to its fullest potential, so she approached the show's musical director, David Caddick, and expressed her wish to hold the word [...] "home", to which he agreed. Although she had been disappointed when she hoped to perform on Broadway in Evita, Cats and Chess, Paige stated of her debut there, [...] "It was just the most perfect time to go with that particular show". After Sunset Boulevard finished, she suffered from depression, commenting that the show's closing [...] "was the most terrible feeling.... I'd felt I'd lost something so very important to me. I thought it had died and gone away." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1964, Mitchell {{discovered}} {{that she was pregnant}} by her Calgary ex-boyfriend Brad MacMath. She later wrote, [...] " [...] left me three months pregnant in an attic room with no money and winter coming on and only a fireplace for heat. The spindles of <b>the</b> <b>banister</b> were gap-toothed fuel for last winter's occupants." [...] At the time, [...] "the pill" [...] was legally unavailable in Canada, as was abortion, yet there was a strong social stigma against women giving birth out of wedlock. In Toronto, she could at least do so quietly, without alarming her relatives back home. In February 1965 she gave birth to a baby girl. Unable to provide for the baby, she placed her daughter, Kelly Dale Anderson, for adoption. The experience remained private for most of her career, but she made allusions to it in several songs, for example [...] "Little Green", which she performed in the 1960s and eventually recorded for the 1971 album Blue.|$|E
2500|$|Abe {{capitalized}} on her notoriety by sitting {{for an interview}} in a popular magazine, and appearing for several years starting in 1947 in a traveling one-act stage production called Shōwa Ichidai Onna (A Woman of the Shōwa Period) under the director of dramatist Nagata Mikihiko. In 1952 she began working at the Hoshikikusui, a working-class pub in Inari-cho, downtown Tokyo. She lived a low-profile life in Tokyo's Shitaya neighborhood for the next 20 years, and her neighborhood restaurant association gave her a [...] "model employee" [...] award. More than once, during the 1960s, film-critic Donald Richie visited the Hoshikikusui. In his collection of profiles, Japanese Portraits, he describes Abe making a dramatic entrance into a boisterous group of drinkers. She would slowly descend a long staircase that led {{into the middle of}} the crowd, fixing a haughty gaze on individuals in her audience. The men in the pub would respond by putting their hands over their crotches, and shouting out things like, [...] "Hide the knives!" [...] and [...] "I'm afraid to go and pee!" [...] Abe would slap <b>the</b> <b>banister</b> in anger and stare the crowd into an uncomfortable and complete silence, and only then continue her entrance, chatting and pouring drinks from table to table. Richie comments, [...] "...she had actually choked a man to death and then cut off his member. There was a consequent frisson when Sada Abe slapped your back." ...|$|E

60|$|Arnold walked on. Suddenly his {{attention}} was arrested. Isaac was leaning over <b>the</b> <b>banister</b> {{of the landing}} above.|$|E
60|$|Going up {{stairs to}} my old haunt, there was Bartleby silently sitting upon <b>the</b> <b>banister</b> at the landing.|$|E
60|$|They were half-way up the staircase, {{which led}} rather sharply from the hall, {{when she stopped}} and grasped <b>the</b> <b>banister.</b>|$|E
60|$|I was half-way up {{the stairs}} by this time. I stopped and looked over <b>the</b> <b>banisters.</b>|$|R
60|$|At {{last she}} heard her mother calling. She started {{to her feet and}} ran to <b>the</b> <b>banisters.</b>|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} she leaned over {{the upper part of}} <b>the</b> <b>banisters</b> and softly spoke to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hark! Who's that?" [...] exclaimed a small pupil-teacher, {{who also}} {{assisted}} this morning, to her great delight. She ran half-way down the stairs, and peeped round <b>the</b> <b>banister.</b> [...] "O, you should, you should, you should!" [...] she exclaimed, scrambling {{up to the}} room again.|$|E
6000|$|Facing him, waving him away, she {{had taken}} another upward step; but he sprang {{to the side of}} the stairs and brought his hand, above <b>the</b> <b>banister,</b> down hard on her wrist. [...] "Do you mean to tell me that I must marry a woman I hate?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{knocked out}} his pipe at last, {{and walked slowly}} and ponderously upstairs. He grinned again as he passed {{the door of the}} housekeeper’s room, and then, with a catch in his breath, {{clutched}} heavily at <b>the</b> <b>banister</b> as a soft female voice bade him [...] "Good-night." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{dinner was}} ready {{she went to}} the stairs and called Anne. A tear-stained face appeared, looking tragically over <b>the</b> <b>banisters.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have broken}} the rules by sliding down <b>the</b> <b>banisters</b> to-day with Miss Carpenter and Miss Wylie. Miss Wylie went first." ...|$|R
60|$|Jill {{was talking}} to the parlourmaid whose head had popped up over <b>the</b> <b>banisters</b> {{flanking}} <b>the</b> stairs that led to the kitchen.|$|R
60|$|He {{had almost}} reached {{the last step}} {{when there was a}} ring at the front door. With what he was {{afterward}} wont to call an inspiration, he retreated with unusual nimbleness until he had almost reached Joan's door again. Then he leaned over <b>the</b> <b>banister</b> and listened.|$|E
60|$|They are at {{the door}} of Elsley's lodgings now. Tom Thurnall meets them there, and bows them upstairs silently. Lucia is so weak that she has to cling to <b>the</b> <b>banister</b> a moment; and then, with a strong shudder, the spirit conquers the flesh, and she hurries up before them both.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] {{said the}} Irishman, hanging on <b>the</b> <b>banister,</b> [...] "he begins by {{bullying}} little chaps; then he bullies the big chaps; then he bullies some one who isn't {{connected with the}} College, and then catches it. Serves him jolly well right... I beg your pardon, sir. I didn't see you were coming down the staircase." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't help it, Mrs. Jobson," [...] he replied, {{sitting down}} upon the bottom stair, and leaning his head against <b>the</b> <b>banisters.</b>|$|R
