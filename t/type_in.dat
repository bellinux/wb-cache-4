5|$|Many modern revival fonts {{based on}} French renaissance {{printing}} {{are influenced by}} the work of Robert Granjon (c. 1513-90), particularly in italic.

5|$|A {{fleet of}} 40 AEC Routemaster buses were {{purchased}} from London Transport in 1986 {{to launch the}} new services in competition with Strathclyde Buses. Kelvin had not previously employed conductors, but introduced them for these services. This meant the vehicles {{did not have to}} spend as long loading at bus stops as one-person operated buses and were able to offer quicker journeys through Glasgow. The Routemasters proved popular with both passengers and staff and continued to operate into the 1990s under successor company Kelvin Central, {{which was one of the}} last operators of the <b>type</b> <b>in</b> regular service in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|A new bow <b>type,</b> <b>in</b> which bone {{reinforcements}} {{cover the}} handle of the bow as well as the tips, may have developed in Central Asia during the 3rd to 2nd century BCE, with earliest finds from the area of Lake Baikal. Fittings from this type of bow appear right across Asia from Korea to the Crimea. Such bows with reinforcement of both grip and siyahs have been called “Hun,” “Hunnic” or “Hsiung-nu” composite bows. Huns did use such bows, but so did many other peoples; Rausing termed this type the 'Qum-Darya Bow' from the Han Chinese type-site at the frontier post of Loulan, {{at the mouth of the}} Qum Darya river, dated by analogy between c. 1st century BCE and the 3rd century CE.|$|E

Franco portrayed the trapped canyoneer Aron Ralston in 127 Hours (2010), a survival drama, which earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination. Franco appeared in four films in 2011, including the poorly-received fantasy film Your Highness, and the science fiction film Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011), a critical and commercial success.|$|E

In 1944, a breed association, the American Cream Association, {{was formed by}} 20 owners and breeders and granted a corporate charter {{in the state of}} Iowa. In 1950, the breed was finally recognized by the Iowa Department of Agriculture, based on a 1948 recommendation by the National Stallion Enrollment Board.|$|E

British neurologist Edwin Bickerstaff, based in Birmingham, described the brainstem encephalitis <b>type</b> <b>in</b> 1951 with Philip Cloake, and made further contributions with another paper in 1957. Guillain had reported on some of these features prior to their full description in 1938. Further subtypes have been described since then, such as the form featuring pure ataxia and the type causing pharyngeal-cervical-brachial weakness. The axonal subtype was first described in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Chris Chibnall {{wanted to}} write a story that tackled the issue of loss and {{revolved}} around a missing person case. Executive producer Russell T Davies appreciated the character dynamics and domestic themes in the episode and cited the script as one of his inspirations in continuing the series. Ruth Jones, who is generally better known for her comedic roles, was cast against <b>type</b> <b>in</b> the central guest role of Nikki Bevan. The episode was filmed largely on location in South Wales with the island of Flat Holm featuring prominently. Response to the episode was generally positive. Reviewers generally praised the episode for illuminating the conflicting elements of Gwen's character and providing a central dilemma with no easy answer. Some critics identified ostensible plot holes, though felt that the episode's emotional successes negated these.|$|E

5|$|Continuing southwards, {{the river}} passes the gallops which {{are part of}} Coombelands Racing Stables, {{situated}} on the eastern bank, and Park Mount, a motte and bailey dating {{from the time of}} the Norman conquest. It is one of the best-preserved monuments of this <b>type</b> <b>in</b> south east England. The river is crossed by Stopham Bridge, a fine medieval stone bridge built in 1422-23. The centre arch was raised as part of the improvements made to the navigation in 1822. It is a Grade I listed structure, and also a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It was damaged by army lorries in the Second World War, but has been repaired, and the heavy traffic on the A283 road was diverted onto a new bridge just upstream of it in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere on the Camp, the Army began {{replacing}} the wartime Nissen huts with more permanent structures. New barracks opened in 1955, and the Headquarters of the Army in Scotland arrived {{the same year}} from Edinburgh Castle. Further land was purchased from Lord Rosebery and married quarters were built close to the river. In 1966, a purpose-built office block, by architects Bowhill Gibson and Laing, was constructed within the walled garden, and named Annandale Block in honour of the builder of Craigiehall. Craigiehall Camp was also {{the site of a}} Cold War Anti-Aircraft Operations Room, built in the 1950s.
