25|$|Adults with language-learning disabilities {{exhibit a}} much smaller McGurk effect than other adults. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> as {{influenced}} by visual input as most people. Therefore, people with poor language skills will produce a smaller McGurk effect. A reason for the smaller effect in this population is {{that there may be}} uncoupled activity between anterior and posterior regions of the brain, or left and right hemispheres.|$|E
25|$|Montgomery County, {{north of}} Houston, is a Republican stronghold, {{supported}} by voters in affluent communities on Lake Conroe and in The Woodlands. Rural {{residents of the}} county, though primarily lower- and middle-class, {{tend to be very}} socially conservative and also have a substantial Republican following. However, the city of Conroe proper, the county seat, tends to lean Democratic. Although The Woodlands is home to many corporate transplants from Europe, Japan, Canada, and Australia, who tend to be of a more liberal persuasion, most of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> U.S. citizens, thus have little impact on the voting trends of the county.|$|E
25|$|SPCD is {{more common}} in the Faroe Islands than in other countries, at least one out of every 1000 {{inhabitants}} of the Faroes has the illness, while the numbers for other countries are one in every 100,000. Around 100 persons in the islands have been diagnosed, around one third of the whole population of 48,000 people have been screened for SPCD. Several young Faroese people and children have died a sudden death with cardiac arrest because of SPCD. Scientists believe that around 10% of the Faroese population are carriers of the gene for SPCD. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> ill, but may have a lower amount of carnitine in their blood than non-carriers.|$|E
50|$|At least 14 {{people died}} during {{the work on the}} facilities. Most of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> from Greece.|$|R

60|$|Aside {{from their}} flat heads, <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> really bad looking. The men were armed with {{bows and arrows}} and had small axes of steel stuck in their metal belts. They wore no hats nor ornaments.|$|R
500|$|After the filming, Burton {{said of the}} cast, [...] "All I can say is {{this is one of}} {{the best}} casts I've ever worked with. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{professional}} singers, so to do a musical like this which I think is one of the most difficult musicals, they all went for it. Every day on the set was a very, very special thing for me. Hearing all these guys sing, I don't know if I can ever have an experience like that again."" [...] Burton said of the singing, [...] "You can't just lip synch, you'd see the throat and the breath, every take they all had to belt it out. It was very enjoyable for me to see, with music on the set everybody just moved differently. I'd seen Johnny (Depp) act in a way I'd never seen before, walking across the room or sitting in the chair, picking up a razor or making a pie, whatever. They all did it in a way that you could sense." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mr. The Englishman {{accepted}} this {{interpretation of the}} matter with an indifferent grace, and observed to himself, in an injured manner, when he was again alone: [...] "I shouldn't mind it so much, if <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> such a"--National Participled--"sentimental people!" ...|$|R
50|$|In July 2012, ShoeDazzle {{signed up}} a record one million new members.

5000|$|Due to {{the nature}} of this {{building}} material, the anthropological documentation for <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> widespread. The manner of wood harvest and continued use of that harvest was purposeful and sustainable.

60|$|<b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> firing {{upon the}} vessels near by Gloucester; but {{straightway}} up the river, {{and therefore it}} was we knew our <b>people</b> <b>were</b> coming over the land in considerable force, giving no more token of an inclination to halt because of this summons by heavy missiles, than had those who manned the fleet.|$|R
25|$|Patients {{from the}} {{aforementioned}} groups should be monitored very closely during therapy {{for signs of}} abuse and development of dependence.

50|$|The Zweletemba township, to the {{southeast}} of the town, was awarded 524 sub-economic, 300 economic dwellings and two hostel schemes of 1274 units for single persons.

Also radium has an indefinite life, {{but that is a}} mineral. Only <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> microbes nor are they minerals.

6000|$|Not that <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{doing all}} they can for me. I know that. I admit it. If I should meet my end here and if--to put the thing {{straight}} out--my lifeless body is found floating {{on the surface of}} this pond, I should like there to be documentary evidence of that much.

Then, turning to the throng of Kings and Queens, he continued: [...] "Tik-Tok has spoken truly, for his machinery will not allow him to lie, nor will it allow his thoughts to think falsely. Therefore <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> our enemies and must be treated with consideration and justice.

6000|$|Lying flat on {{his back}} {{at the bottom of the}} boat, Godfrey raised his cap; almost instantaneously there were three or four sharp taps on the side of the boat, and one arrow passed through it but an inch above his chest. In a moment he sat upright with a paddle in his hand, and a couple of sharp strokes sent the boat out into the centre of the current. At this moment they heard a series of yells and splashes. [...] "Lucky for them," [...] Luka laughed, [...] "I made the slits so big.

But frankly, you are doing an {{absolutely}} unwise thing in staying here. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> my servants. They are hers. They are beyond my bribing. Violet," [...] he added, dropping his voice a little, and drawing her into his arms, [...] "don't be foolish, dear. Don't {{run the risk of}} bringing disaster upon both of us. You wouldn't care to have to do without her now. Nor should I. It was a little thoughtless of you to come, dear. Do follow my advice now, and I will try and make it up to you very soon.

6000|$|There {{was also}} a slight {{sensation}} here when the Chancellor [...] of the Exchequer brought in his first appropriation for [...] maintaining prohibition. From {{our point of view}} in America, [...] it was modest enough. But <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> used to it. [...] The Chancellor merely asked for ten million pounds a month [...] to begin on; he explained that his task was heavy; he has to [...] police, not only the entire coast, but also the interior; [...] for the Grampian Hills of Scotland alone he asked a million. [...] There was a good deal of questioning in the House over these [...] figures. The Chancellor was asked if he intended to keep a [...] hired spy at every street corner in London. He answered, [...] "No, only on every other street." [...] He added also that every [...] spy must wear a brass collar with his number.|$|E
50|$|As for {{the driving}} {{off of the}} Bassa and Bokoko, <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> fishermen. They <b>were</b> farmers, so getting them to leave the coast and major rivers for the {{interior}} would presumably <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> too difficult. The Bassa and Bakoko would have avoided conflict by doing so, {{and they would be}} better able to farm in the interior anyway.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] Mr. Arbuton looked {{blank and}} not {{altogether}} pleased. Milwaukee was bad enough, though {{he understood that}} it <b>was</b> largely <b>peopled</b> from New England, and had a great German element, which might account {{for the fact that}} <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> quite barbaric. But this Eriecreek, New York State! [...] "I don't think I've heard of it," [...] he said.|$|R
50|$|The {{island was}} first settled by Mesolithic and Neolithic <b>peoples.</b> There <b>is</b> archaeological {{evidence}} at the sites of Vela Spila (Big Cave) and at Jakas Cave {{near the village of}} Zrnovo.

60|$|The most terrifying {{reflection}} (I am speaking now for myself) is {{that all}} <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{the product of the}} exceptional but of the general--of the normality of their place, and time, and race. The ferocity and imbecility of an autocratic rule rejecting all legality and in fact basing itself upon complete moral anarchism provokes the no less imbecile and atrocious answer of a purely Utopian revolutionism encompassing destruction by the first means to hand, in the strange conviction that a fundamental change of hearts must follow the downfall of any given human institutions. These people are unable to see that all they can effect is merely a change of names. The oppressors and the oppressed are all Russians together; and the world is brought once more {{face to face with the}} truth of the saying that the tiger cannot change his stripes nor the leopard his spots.|$|E
60|$|His {{troubles}} {{are very}} likely over by this time. The two fools who caused his misery will never read this history of him; THEY never read godless stories in magazines: and I wish, honest reader, {{that you and}} I went to church {{as much as they}} do. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> wicked BECAUSE of their religious observances, but IN SPITE of them. They are too dull to understand humility, too blind to see a tender and simple heart under a rough ungainly bosom. They are sure that all their conduct towards my poor friend here has been perfectly righteous, and that they have given proofs of the most Christian virtue. Haggarty's wife is considered by her friends as a martyr to a savage husband, and her mother is the angel that has come to rescue her. All they did was to cheat him and desert him. And safe in that wonderful self-complacency with which the fools of this earth are endowed, they have not a single pang of conscience for their villany towards him, consider their heartlessness as a proof and consequence of their spotless piety and virtue.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you could}} {{disguise}} your nationality, {{you would not}} find any insolence here. These shopkeepers detest the English and despise the Americans; they are rude to both, more especially to ladies of your nationality and mine. If these go shopping without a gentleman or a man-servant, they are tolerably sure {{to be subjected to}} petty insolences--insolences of manner and tone, rather than word, though words that are hard to bear are not always wanting. I know of an instance where a shopkeeper tossed a coin back to an American lady with the remark, snappishly uttered, 'We don't take French money here.' And I know of a case where an English lady said to one of these shopkeepers, 'Don't you think you ask too much for this article?' and he replied with the question, 'Do you think you are obliged to buy it?' However, <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> impolite to Russians or Germans. And as to rank, they worship that, for they have long been used to generals and nobles. If you wish to see what abysses servility can descend, present yourself before a Baden-Baden shopkeeper in the character of a Russian prince." ...|$|E
50|$|During {{his time}} as commandant in Dachau, 35 <b>people</b> <b>were</b> hanged and 18 <b>people</b> <b>were</b> shot. Before his post-war trial, Weiss insisted that <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> KZ prisoners, but prisoners of the Gestapo. He said they were sentenced to death by order of Heinrich Himmler and the Reich Main Security Office. This contradicted the {{statement}} of Johann Kicks, and was also {{a violation of the}} rules of the concentration camps Lagerordnung.|$|R
5|$|The UMWA {{took action}} against Pittston's new plan of {{operation}} {{and offered to}} reach a settlement. The coal company stayed quiet, and {{when the time came}} to renew the health care and retirement benefit plans for its workers, Pittston refused. The refusal to renew the contract left about 1,500 people without health care. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> just miners employed by Pittston, but also families, widows, and disabled miners in the Virginia area.|$|R
50|$|R. De Staningtona {{made use}} of the {{explanations}} of Averroes in compiling his text. His work was probably employed in the Oxford Dominican convent for the preliminary education of the brothers. Many of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> degree candidates.
