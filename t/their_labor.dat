5|$|George Pullman and William Halliday {{familiarized}} {{themselves with}} their industrial operations, giving {{attention to the}} minutest details. <b>Their</b> <b>labor</b> forces, tempered by the demands of industry in America, expected to work hard {{in exchange for the}} necessities of life. Cooperation between managers and workers created a higher standard of living, which in turn, encouraged better working conditions.Good housing also helped promote good work habits.|$|E
5|$|Race {{relations}} were tense during the Reconstruction era, as whites resisted freedmen {{being allowed to}} choose <b>their</b> <b>labor,</b> vote, and have freedom of movement. Following a fire that damaged many businesses, the riot of 1871 erupted, with whites attacking blacks in the community. The black community had expanded after the war, as people moved to the city for more opportunity and to create community away from white supervision.|$|E
5|$|A severe drought from 1130 to 1180 led {{to rapid}} {{depopulation}} {{in many parts}} of the San Juan Basin, particularly at Chaco Canyon. As the extensive Chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to Mesa Verde, causing major population growth in the area. This led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for Mesa Verdeans, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. In order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more of <b>their</b> <b>labor</b> to farming. Population increases also led to expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the Mesa Verdeans had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture was the empire's {{main source}} of income through taxes on land and produce. The {{majority}} of the people lived in villages and worked farming the staple crops of rice, pulses, and cotton in the dry areas and sugarcane in areas having sufficient rainfall, with areca and betel being the chief cash crops. The living conditions of the labourers who farmed the land must have been bearable as there are no records of revolts by the landless against wealthy landlords. If peasants were disgruntled the common practice was to migrate in large numbers out of the jurisdiction of the ruler who was mistreating them, thereby depriving him of revenue from <b>their</b> <b>labor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect farmers, parents of young children, and others whose hours are {{set by the}} sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice, although some farmers are neutral. One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer <b>their</b> <b>labor</b> is less valuable. Dairy farmers are another group who complain of the change. Their cows {{are sensitive to the}} timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems. Today some farmers' groups are in favor of DST.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons try to {{hold the}} poachers but {{eventually}} they break into the sanctuary. The poachers are revealed to be Greenpeace activists, who prove that Dr. Bushwell is actually a chimp slave master, exploiting <b>their</b> <b>labor</b> at a nearby diamond mine. Worried that the Simpsons will report her to the authorities, Dr. Bushwell offers everyone diamonds as a bribe - which all the Simpsons except Lisa happily accept. On the plane ride back to Springfield, it is revealed that their former tour guide, Kitenge, is {{now president of the}} country, with the former president now the Simpsons' flight attendant.|$|E

5|$|In April 1944, the Regiment {{departed}} California {{aboard the}} USS General John Pope for Oro Bay, New Guinea. On {{the way to}} New Guinea the Regiment spent part of June in Australia. Upon arriving at Oro Bay, it {{was assigned to the}} 31st Infantry Division, 8th Army to provide area security and continue training. Some soldiers were then assigned to the Alamo Scouts, the 5217th Reconnaissance Battalion, and to the Philippine Regional Section of Allied Intelligence Bureau. One example was Second Lieutenant Rafael Ileto, a future Vice Chief of Staff in the Philippines, who led a team in the Alamo Scouts. Due to the reassignment of these soldiers, both Filipino Infantry Regiments became smaller than authorized. In response, the 2nd Filipino Infantry Regiment was disbanded and used to bring the 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment to 125% of its standard allocated size. The remaining soldiers of the 2nd Filipino Infantry Regiment who did not join the Regiment formed the 2nd Filipino Infantry Battalion (Separate). During its time at Oro Bay the Regiment was reinforced with Filipinos from Hawaii. These men {{had not been able to}} enlist in the Army until 1943 as the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association had successfully argued that <b>their</b> <b>labor</b> was needed in the sugar industry.|$|E
5|$|Villermé’s Tableau {{discussed}} {{the role of}} industrialization on the general health {{and quality of life}} for the laboring class. His perspective in this work is unique in that he maintained that the process of industrialization is not completely to blame. He even suggested the industrial movement to be beneficial for the future of society, calling on examples of industrialization in the United States. He also {{discussed the}} role of children working in the textile industry. The point is made that, in some cases, {{at least half of the}} workforce in a textile factory was made up of the children of textile workers, many under the age of eighteen. Villermé contrasted the quality of life of workers who maintained family life with those taken over completely by <b>their</b> <b>labor.</b> He blamed both the working conditions associated with industrialization as well as the workers themselves to an extent. This work served not only as valuable information to medical institutions and boards, but also as a social statement, widely accepted by the public. It is from this work that Villermé received his reputation as a moral economist.|$|E
5|$|When Ponce de León {{arrived in}} Puerto Rico, {{he was well}} {{received}} by the Cacique (Tribal chief) Agüeybaná (The Great Sun), chieftain of the island Taino tribes. Besides the conquistadors, {{some of the first}} colonists were farmers and miners in search of gold. In 1508, Ponce de León became the first appointed governor of Puerto Rico, founding the first settlement of Caparra between the modern-day cities of Bayamón and San Juan. After being named Governor, de León and the conquistadors forced the Tainos to work in the mines and to build fortifications; many Tainos {{died as a result of}} cruel treatment during <b>their</b> <b>labor.</b> In 1510, upon Agüeybaná's death, his brother Güeybaná, better known as Agüeybaná II (The Brave), and a group of Tainos led Diego Salcedo, a Spaniard, to a river and drowned him, proving to his people that the white men were not gods. Upon realizing this, Agüeybaná II led his people in the Taino rebellion of 1511, the first rebellion in the island against the better armed Spanish forces. Guarionex, cacique of Utuado, attacked the village of Sotomayor (present day Aguada) and killed eighty of its inhabitants. Cacique Guarionex died during the attack which was considered a Taino victory.|$|E

5|$|As Southern {{states began}} the process of forming governments, Johnson's {{policies}} received considerable public support in the North, which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the South. While he received such support from the white South, he underestimated the determination of Northerners {{to ensure that the}} war had not been fought for nothing. It was important, in Northern public opinion, that the South acknowledge its defeat, that slavery be ended, and that the lot of African Americans be improved. Voting rights were less important—after all, only a handful of Northern states (mostly in New England) gave African-American men the right to vote on the same basis as whites, and in late 1865, Connecticut, Wisconsin, and Minnesota voted down African-American suffrage proposals by large margins. Northern public opinion tolerated Johnson's inaction on black suffrage as an experiment, to be allowed if it quickened Southern acceptance of defeat. Instead, white Southerners felt emboldened. A number of Southern states passed Black Codes, binding African-American laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not quit, and allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for vagrancy and rent out <b>their</b> <b>labor.</b> Most Southerners elected to Congress were former Confederates, with the most prominent being Georgia Senator-designate and former Confederate vice president Alexander Stephens. Congress assembled in early December 1865; Johnson's conciliatory annual message to them was well received. Nevertheless, Congress refused to seat the Southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate Reconstruction legislation.|$|E

5000|$|During the New Kingdom {{and into}} the Late Period (747-332 BC), the wooden models were {{developed}} into {{what are known as}} Shabti or Ushabti. Shabti, similarly, were funerary models provided in the tombs of Egyptian royalty to spare the tomb owner from labor in the next life. Shabtis were inscribed with chapter 6 of The Book of the Dead providing them with instructions that enabled them to perform <b>their</b> <b>labors.</b> [...] "Overseer" [...] models were also provided to ensure the shabti performed <b>their</b> <b>labors.</b> Shabtis were composed of wood, clay, wax, stone, bronze, faience, or glass. The practice died out during the Ptolemaic period (332-30 BC).|$|R
