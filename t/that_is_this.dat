25|$|By this definition, a {{sequence}} of sets approaches a limiting set when the limiting set includes elements which are in all except finitely many sets of the sequence and does not include elements which are in all except finitely many complements of sets of the sequence. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>this</b> case specializes the general definition when the topology on set X is induced from the discrete metric.|$|E

Notation: r = base resistance of transistor, rO = output resistance, and gm = transconductance. The negative sign for h21 reflects the convention that I1, I2 are positive when directed into the two-port. A non-zero value for h12 means the output voltage affects the input voltage, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>this</b> amplifier is bilateral. If h12 = 0, the amplifier is unilateral.|$|E

25|$|In general, neither {{impedance}} nor admittance can be {{time varying}} {{as they are}} defined for complex exponentials for –∞ < t < +∞. If the complex exponential voltage–current ratio changes over time or amplitude, the circuit element cannot be described using the frequency domain. However, many systems (e.g., varicaps {{that are used in}} radio tuners) may exhibit non-linear or time-varying voltage–current ratios that appear to be linear time-invariant (LTI) for small signals over small observation windows; hence, they can be roughly described as having a time-varying impedance. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>this</b> description is an approximation; over large signal swings or observation windows, the voltage–current relationship is non-LTI and cannot be described by impedance.|$|E
500|$|Mark Lepage of Blender claimed <b>that</b> <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> It {{is similar}} to the works of 1970s bands the Velvet Underground, Television and the Feelies.

AllMusic's Heather Phares concluded, [...] "Granted, their high-fashion appeal and faultless influences... have 'critics' darlings' written all over them. But like the similarly lauded Elastica and Supergrass before them, the Strokes don't rehash the sounds that inspire them—they remake them in their own image." ...|$|E

[...] While Dan Rankin of Blare Magazine said the album was [...] "essentially just another fat kid on the already rusty trampoline <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> genre." [...] Brooke Daly of Tastemakers said that the album {{was one of the}} band's [...] "more solid releases" [...] with less repetition than on Homesick.

Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, described the Strokes as [...] "a great groove band", and noted that [...] "the beats implode, clashing/resolving with punky brevity and gnarly faux simplicity". In a perfect 10 review, NME reviewer John Robinson indicated <b>that</b> <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> It {{was one of the}} best debut LPs by a guitar band during the past 20years.

Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave [...] "Synchrony" [...] two out of four stars, considering it a middling episode with some effective moments, but complaining about plot holes, [...] "not particularly compelling" [...] supporting characters, and feeling that time travel [...] "takes away from the reality <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> show's foundation". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode {{two and a half stars}} out of five, praising the [...] "high concept that is told without pretension". The two also called the episode [...] "solid and watchable" [...] despite flaws such as the underdevelopment of the script and not fully exploring the [...] "concept with such potential" [...] that is time travel.|$|E

500|$|Gary Mulholland of The Observer {{considers}} {{the release of}} Is This It a [...] "world-changing moment" [...] and notes that its impact was [...] "immediate and dramatic" [...] on both music and attire. BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe suggests that the album moved popular opinion from DJs and pop music to [...] "skinny jeans and guitars", [...] "the template for rock 'n' roll in the modern day". Tam Gunn of FACT agrees and explains that it [...] "caused a sea change" [...] in mainstream music in the US and the UK, while Anthony Miccio of Stylus {{points out that the}} Strokes' success created the commercial context for [...] "other new-wavers" [...] to flourish. Rolling Stone writes <b>that</b> <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> It inspired [...] "a ragged revolt" [...] in Britain, led by the Libertines and Arctic Monkeys, and continued its influence in the US on the success of bands like Kings of Leon. The Observer shares a similar view and concludes that [...] "a fine brood of heirs", like the Libertines and Franz Ferdinand, would not have existed and been successful if the Strokes had not reinvigorated [...] "rock's obsession with having a good time". Jared Followill of Kings of Leon notes that the album {{was one of the main}} reasons that he wanted to get into a band; he states, [...] "The title track was one of the first basslines I learned...
