Thomas Hamm, in his book Quakers in America, describes a transition among most Friends from plainness to simplicity.|$|E
25|$|Kristiansen's mother testified {{during the}} trial that she saw her son {{arriving}} and walking in the backyard {{on the evening of}} the murders, and as such could not have been at the murder-site. This statement also matched the measurements in the telecommunication reports since the cell cite connected to Kristiansen's phone was close to his home, a fact Kristiansen's mother couldn't have known about since the cell phone alibi wasn't discovered until the trial was almost over. Furthermore, a witness saw a man together with two girls right before the crime. The description he gave matched Andersen and the victims. He did not see a second man, and it's unlikely that the witness saw Kristiansen instead of Andersen since Kristansen is a short and thin while Andersen is tall and big. Despite extensive public outreach for everyone who was in the area to contact the police, no other people matched this description. <b>This</b> <b>witness,</b> a commercial airline pilot, was not called as witness to the trials. Additional 5 people that heard or saw relevant activity that did not fit the timeline created by the police were not called as witness to the court either.|$|E
500|$|Unbeknownst to the Fringe team, September has {{engineered}} several {{events in}} the last few days, including stopping an armed robbery to help the asthmatic female employee (Olivia Cheng) recover from an asthma attack, taking her inhaler. When Walter hears of <b>this</b> <b>witness,</b> he requests Peter and Agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) to bring her to his lab, believing her {{to be related to the}} Observer's warning. Minutes from the lab, September rams the car in which the woman is being transported, initiating another asthma attack. September races from the scene, prompting Peter to follow him in Walter's car, requesting Walter to [...] "give me the keys and save the girl." [...] Walter realizes that September has been orchestrating the events leading up to this point and urges Peter not to go, believing that following the advice of the Observer might lead to Peter's death. Walter eventually relents and returns to help the woman, creating a makeshift inhaler before emergency help arrives. Meanwhile, Peter and Olivia follow the Observer to a rooftop. Peter corners September, who says [...] "It must be very difficult, being a father", before he shoots Peter with an energy blast that knocks him off his feet. Olivia arrives in time to give chase to the Observer but September disappears from an adjacent rooftop.|$|E

2500|$|Lord Boyd of Duncansby's role as Lord Advocate {{featured}} {{leading the}} prosecution in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial between May 2000 and January 2001. Of the two defendants, one – Fhimah – was acquitted {{and the other}} – Megrahi – was convicted on 31 January 2001 of 270 counts of murder, and sentenced to 27 years in jail. Controversy continues to surround Megrahi's conviction despite the rejection of his appeal on 14 March 2002. Evidence presented at the trial has been called into question and doubts have been expressed about the reliability of several key prosecution witnesses. According to The Sunday Times of 23 October 2005 former Lord Advocate, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, described one such witness as [...] "not quite the full shilling" [...] and [...] "an apple short of a picnic". Boyd has demanded that Lord Fraser should issue a public statement clarifying what he actually said about <b>this</b> <b>witness,</b> and {{what he meant by}} those remarks.|$|E
2500|$|One {{of these}} films was among the last made by Mary Miles Minter. Gibson (in her words) [...] "fled" [...] the United States to the Far East in 1934, where she married Elbert Lewis, who worked for Socony (later Mobil Oil). She {{returned}} to Los Angeles in 1940, for medical reasons. Her husband died in a March 1942 attack by the Japanese on the Socony oil refinery at Penang, Straits Settlements (now Malaysia) during World War II. Lewis left Gibson a small pension, which she lived on until her death in 1964. In 1999, the widely cited newsletter Taylorology published an account that on 21 October 1964, while living in the Hollywood Hills under the name Pat Lewis, Gibson suffered a heart attack. As a recently converted Roman Catholic, she confessed before dying, that she had [...] "shot and killed William Desmond Taylor", along with several other things the witness to her confession didn't understand and then, more than 30 years later, could not remember. <b>This</b> <b>witness</b> later repeated his recollection in a televised documentary.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{decision}} issued December 29, 1965, Judges John Simpson Hastings, Winfred George Knoch, and Luther Merritt Swygert for the Seventh Circuit Court upheld Bolden's conviction and denied a retrial. The Court wrote {{that they found}} no merit to his claim {{that he had not}} received an impartial trial under Perry, and that his opinion to the deliberating jurors as to what the evidence showed could not be equated with personal bias. Regarding Spagnoli's testimony at Bolden's trial, the Court said his testimony was [...] "merely cumulative" [...] and rejected Bolden's [...] "central contention" [...] that Spagnoli was an essential witness for the prosecution whose testimony could only be corroborated by the testimony of Jones. Addressing the issue of perjury that was at the core of Bolden's appeal, the Seventh Circuit Court noted what Spagnoli had testified at both trials and said he had not actually perjured himself about his source of income. The Court noted that Spagnoli's [...] "livelihood was clearly a collateral matter bearing upon his credibility" [...] and that they did not believe [...] "the jury's overall appraisal of <b>this</b> <b>witness</b> would have been substantially affected by the knowledge that he was being less than forthright concerning his source of income." ...|$|E

The second individual considered [...] "of interest" [...] to the Los Angeles Police Department in their investigation into Reet Jurvetson's murder is the first suspect's likely roommate: a man with a Beatles-style haircut, possibly also named [...] "Jean", who is known to have informed a close friend of Reet in the spring of 1970 that he and the first suspect had lived with Reet in Los Angeles the previous year. This individual had claimed Reet had left the two men of her own volition; he had also made brief attempts to assure Reet's close friend she (Reet) had not been in any form of danger when she had left the two men, making a statement to the effect of: [...] "Oh yeah, she was with us {{for a couple of weeks}} and then she left on her own and everything's fine.
