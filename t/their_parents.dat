5|$|Albatross chicks take a {{long time}} to fledge. In the case of the great albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes {{anywhere}} between 140 and 170 days. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b> Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. Albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> who return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first out at sea.|$|E
5|$|By 24–28days after hatching, {{the young}} birds start to perch on {{branches}} near the nest {{and take their}} first flight. They are fed by <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> for a further 28–30days, staying close to the nest while growing and practicing flying. At this stage they are extremely vocal, and their cries to <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> can often be heard a considerable distance away. The young hawks disperse after <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> stop provisioning them. Though they receive {{the same amount of}} food, male chicks (roughly half the size of females) mature more quickly and seem to be ready to leave the nest sooner. In a study in the Forest of Ae, south-west Scotland, it was found that 21% of nestlings over two days old died, with the causes of death being starvation, wet weather, predation and desertion by the parents. The parasite Leucocytozoon toddi can be passed from parent to nestling at the nest, possibly {{because of the number of}} birds sharing a small space, thus allowing transmission.|$|E

40|$|Inner-shell {{electronic}} structures, {{properties and}} ionization spectra of DNA/RNA bases are studied {{with respect to}} <b>their</b> <b>parent</b> pyrimidine and purine species. Density functional theory B 3 LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ has been employed to produce the geometries of the bases, whereas LB 94 /et-pVQZ//B 3 LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ {{is used to calculate}} site-related Hirshfeld charges and core (vertical) ionization energies, as well as inner-shell spectra of C 1 s, N 1 s and O 1 s for DNA/RNA bases and <b>their</b> <b>parent</b> pyrimidine and purine species. The site-dependent variations of properties indicate the changes and inheritance of chemical environment when pyrimidine and purine become substituted. In general, although the changes are site-dependent, they are also ring-dependent. Pyrimidine bases change less significantly with respect to <b>their</b> <b>parent</b> pyrimidine than the purine bases with respect to <b>their</b> <b>parent</b> purine. Pyrimidine bases such as uracil, thymine and cytosine inherit certain properties from <b>their</b> <b>parent</b> pyrimidine, such as the Hirshfeld charge distributions and the order of core ionization energy level etc. No particular sites in the pyrimidine derivatives are engaged with a dramatic chemical shift nor with energy crossings to other sites. For the core shell spectra, the purine bases inherit very little from <b>their</b> <b>parent</b> purine, and guanine exhibits the least similarities to the parent among all the DNA/RNA bases...|$|R

They did not tell <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> that they were racing. The twins each had two wins after their first four races.

5|$|The eggs hatch after 53 to 60days of {{incubation}} by both parents. Chicks {{are born}} with their eyes open and sometimes {{can take up to}} a week to leave the shell completely. The young are covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b> They are able to fly after five to six months, but continue to roost and forage with <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> until they are in their second year, at which point the parents typically turn their energies to a new nest.

5|$|The {{point at}} which chicks fledge varies dramatically. The chicks of the Synthliboramphus murrelets, like the ancient murrelet, leave the nest the night after they hatch, {{following}} <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators. Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age. In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, {{they are able to}} fly. The amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging. Chicks may also follow <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> during their first migration.|$|E
5|$|The {{young are}} covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b> They are able to fly after six months, but {{continue}} to roost and hunt with <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch. Healthy adults have no natural predators, but large birds of prey and mammalian predators, like foxes, may take eggs or hatchlings. Predation is relatively uncommon, since the vigilant parents often aggressively displace birds of prey who come near and the rocky, precipitous location of most nests are difficult for mammals to access.|$|E
