The [...] "Rainier" [...] <b>test</b> (<b>part</b> of Operation Plumbbob, performed in Nevada) produced strong seismic signals, but looked much like an ordinary earthquake. In 1959, Dr. James R. Killian, the Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, formed the Panel on Seismic Improvement (which subsequently recommended the program that {{came to be known as}} Vela Uniform), with the twin goals of improving seismic instruments and deploying them globally, and researching in more depth the seismic effects of nuclear explosions. The project was subsequently initiated by the Eisenhower administration.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} half of 2010, the testing {{activity}} focused on tool wear management and machining a part in multiple setups with multiple alternate machining plans for 3, 4 and 5-axis machining. [...] The new <b>test</b> <b>part</b> was a gear box that must be machined on all six sides. The tool wear and consequent machine loads were predicted from the STEP-NC data and verified using a dynamometer. [...] In the second half of 2010, the testing forum applied STEP-NC to set up compensation with on-machine measurement of part and fixture datums using a FaroArm portable measurement device.|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{reliability}} of congeneric tests, specifically designed reliability measures have been proposed. This paper emphasizes that such measures rely on a unidimensionality hypothesis, which can neither be confirmed nor rejected when {{there are only three}} <b>test</b> <b>parts,</b> and will invariably be rejected when there are more than three <b>test</b> <b>parts.</b> Jackson and Agunwamba's (1977) greatest lower bound to reliability is proposed instead. Although this bound has a reputation for overestimating the population value when the sample size is small, this is no reason to prefer the unidimensionality-based reliability. Firstly, the sampling bias problem of the glb does not play a role when the number of <b>test</b> <b>parts</b> is small, {{as is often the case}} with congeneric measures. Secondly, glb and unidimensionality based reliability are often equal when there are three <b>test</b> <b>parts,</b> and when there are more <b>test</b> <b>parts,</b> their numerical values are still very similar. To the extent that the bias problem of the greatest lower bound does play a role, unidimensionality-based reliability is equally affected. Although unidimensionality and reliability are often thought of as unrelated, this paper shows that, from at least two perspectives, they act as antagonistic concepts. A measure, based on the same framework that led to the greatest lower bound, is discussed for assessing how close is a set of variables to unidimensionality. It is the percentage of common variance that can be explained by a single factor. An empirical example is given to demonstrate the main points of the paper...|$|R

5000|$|Gary Sommargren {{proposed}} a point diffraction interferometer design which directly followed from the basic design where {{parts of the}} diffracted wavefront was used for testing and the remaining part for detection as shown in Figure 3. This design was a major upgrade to existing systems. The scheme could accurately measure the optical surface with variations of 1 nm. The phase shifting was obtained by moving the <b>test</b> <b>part</b> with a piezo electric translation stage. An unwanted side effect of moving the <b>test</b> <b>part</b> is that the defocus also moves distorting the fringes. Another downsides of Sommargren's approach is that it produces low contrast fringes [...] and an attempt to regulate the contrast also modifies the measured wavefront.|$|E
