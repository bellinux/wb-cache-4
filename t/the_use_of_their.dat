5|$|Dodge's {{screenplay}} for Bad Words was {{featured on the}} 2011 Black List and was shortly thereafter picked up by Bateman. In the original script, the story was set at the Scripps National Spelling Bee, but the name was changed to a fictional bee since the filmmakers did not expect Scripps to allow <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> name in the film. After two other actors declined to play the main character, Bateman decided {{to take on the}} role himself, and cast the other roles by a combination of contacting friends and open casting calls. Filming took place in Los Angeles at the end of 2012.|$|E

Abraham Lincoln was portrayed on the 1861 $10 Demand Note; Salmon Chase, Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury, approved his own portrait for the 1862 $1 Legal Tender Note; Winfield Scott was depicted on Interest Bearing Notes during the early 1860s; and Francis Spinner and Spencer Clark both approved <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own image on fractional currency. In 1873, driven {{in large part by}} the actions of Spinner and Clark, Congress prohibited the use of portraits of living people on any U.S. bond, security, note, or fractional or postal currency.|$|E

Due to the relative {{lack of interest in}} winter sport in Australia, both Camplin and Bradbury had been without sponsorship before their Olympic triumphs, and were effectively broke.|$|E

5|$|The disdain of the British {{people for}} the Boers was {{recorded}} {{as early as the}} 18th century. The Boers were portrayed to the British public in literature and editorial cartoons as uncivilised and cruel, especially in order to obtain the support of the British public for British imperialism and the Second Boer War. The English term Boer-hater was used in a political context in the British Cape Colony as early as 1889, referring to persons opposing Cape Dutch interests, <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> language in Parliament in particular.|$|E

5|$|According to Moyzisch, the German Foreign Office did {{not make}} much use of the documents, because {{officers}} there were divided about their reliability for several reasons. There was {{a steady stream of}} documents, which was highly unusual. Cicero seemed to have used sophisticated photography techniques to create unusually clear images, which raised the question of whether he acted alone. Antipathy between Papen and Ribbentrop added to the ineffective analysis of the intelligence. Aware of the Allied forces attempts to bring Turkey into the war, however, Papen was able to thwart their efforts for a time by threatening to destroy İzmir and Istanbul if Turkey declared war against Germany. Being able to postpone Turkey's alliance with the Allied forces and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> airfields, Papen told Ribbentrop that the way was now clear to take the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|Following the battle, Wayne ordered Scott's {{volunteers to}} conduct {{numerous}} raids within a fifty-mile radius of their position. Due {{to a lack}} of pack horses in Wayne's force, the mounted volunteers were also employed transporting supplies between forts throughout September 1794. They eventually grew weary of garrison duty and complained that <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> personal horses to transport goods had injured the animals. Many threatened to mutiny if not discharged. On October 13, 1794, Wayne finally ordered them home. In a commendation of Wayne issued on December 4, 1794, the U.S. House of Representatives specifically thanked Scott and his men for their service at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The Treaty of Greenville formally ended the war in mid-1795.|$|E
5|$|On November 6, 2013, Disney Consumer Products began {{releasing}} {{a line of}} merchandise featuring Anna in Disney Store and other retailers. Various versions of Anna dolls include the fashion doll set, the mini-doll set, plush doll, Anna-as-a-toddler doll, and a special version called Musical Magic Elsa and Anna Dolls, which lights up and plays their signature songs that appear in the film when users hold their hands or they hold each other's hands. Anna's merchandise also covers {{a wide range of}} other products, such as rolling luggage, boots, clothes, nightgowns, bowls, plates, coffee mugs, and home décors. In addition, the film was adapted as simplified storybooks for children, with diverse versions featuring sound effects, original character voices, and mini projectors that project movie images on the wall. One of those books, called A Sister More Like Me, includes illustrations by Brittney Lee, the film's visual development artist. Both Anna and Elsa appear as playable characters in Disney Infinity through <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> corresponding figurines.|$|E
5|$|The added {{height of}} the spire allowed the Chrysler Building to surpass 40 Wall Street as the tallest {{building}} {{in the world and}} the Eiffel Tower as the tallest structure. The Chrysler Building was thus the first man-made structure to be taller than , and as one newspaper noted, the tower was also taller than the highest points of five states. The new Chrysler Building, appraised at $14 million, was also exempt from city taxes as per an 1859 law that gave tax exemptions to sites owned by the Cooper Union. Although the city had attempted to repeal the tax exemption, Cooper Union opposed that measure, and because the Chrysler Building retains the tax exemption, it has paid Cooper Union for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> land since opening.|$|E

The name Manuel was retired in 2014, after it became the first Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in mainland Mexico, redevelop over water, and become a hurricane. At the 2015 hurricane committee meeting the name Odile was retired from the list of names after it became the first major hurricane to affect Baja California in 25 years. The name Isis was also pre-emptively retired from the lists of names for 2016, as it was deemed inappropriate to be used because of the Islamic extremist rebel group.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins with}} Emmon, a lowland runaway, coming to Caspromant when Orrec and Gry are 16. The {{children}} tell Emmon of their gifts, {{though he is}} somewhat disbelieving of them. Orrec then narrates the history of his family from his childhood. His father Canoc is the brantor of Caspromant; his mother Melle, a woman from the lowlands. Despite living in the Uplands, Melle holds to some of her traditions, and teaches Orrec stories and lays that she had learned as a child. She also teaches him to read, an ability rare among Uplanders. Canoc also begins to instruct Orrec in <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> power, though Orrec does not manifest any ability as a child. Orrec and Gry, of a similar age, become good friends, and Gry begins to show her power, being able {{to listen to the}} speech of cats and mice.|$|E
5|$|The Rathores, {{rulers of}} Marwar and {{successful}} Rajput cavalry, were the traditional breeders of the Marwari. The Rathores were forced from their Kingdom of Kanauj in 1193, and withdrew into the Great Indian and Thar Deserts. The Marwari was vital to their survival, {{and during the}} 12th century they followed strict selective breeding processes, keeping the finest stallions for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> subjects. During this time, the horses were considered divine beings, and at times they were only allowed to be ridden {{by members of the}} Rajput families and the Kshatriyas warrior caste. When the Moguls captured northern India in the early 16th century they brought Turkoman horses that were probably used to supplement the breeding of the Marwari. Marwaris were renowned during this period for their bravery and courage in battle, as well as their loyalty to their riders. During the late 16th century, the Rajputs of Marwar, under the leadership of Moghul emperor Akbar, formed a cavalry force over 50,000strong. The Rathores believed that the Marwari horse could only leave a battlefield under one of three conditions– victory, death, or carrying a wounded master to safety. The horses were trained to be extremely responsive in battlefield conditions, and were practised in complex riding maneuvers. Over 300years later, during the First World War, Marwar lancers under Sir Pratap Singh assisted the British.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Adolescents with an {{intellectual}} disability have difficulties in maintaining social contacts {{and finding a}} way to spend <b>their</b> leisure time. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> internet can be helpful, but also has risks. Hardly any research has been done into the risk factors <b>of</b> internet <b>used</b> by intellectual disabled adolescents. In addition, there is hardly any research available on parents of a mentally disabled child and how they manage <b>the</b> internet <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> child. <b>The</b> research question is: “What is the role of parents on <b>the</b> internet <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> intellectual disabled children?” The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the parenting roles concerning <b>the</b> internet <b>use</b> between children with and without {{an intellectual}} disability. Method: This research has been conducted on the basis of qualitative interviews. The total number of participants was thirteen. The processing and the analysis of data was done on the basis of NVivo 11. Results: From the interviews appeared that <b>the</b> internet <b>use</b> has a lot of advantages for the children, such as maintaining social contacts, how to spend their leisure time and the improvement of language skills. Disadvantages are –according to the parents– <b>the</b> compulsive <b>use</b> <b>of</b> internet, <b>the</b> influence images/movies have on the children and being susceptible of abuse. Three roles can be determined concerning <b>the</b> internet <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> child: <b>the</b> encouraging, the attendant and the controlling parent. Parents switch between these three roles. In general parents control <b>the</b> internet <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mentally disordered children more than <b>the</b> internet <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> children without a disorder. Finally it has been found that the parents who participated in this survey have no need for information (sessions) about <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> internet of children with an intellectual disorder. Most parents do stress out that school lessons about this subject is important. Conclusion and discussion: The three parental roles from this study can be compared with the parenting styles from parents of children with a normal development. The difference is, however, that adolescents with an intellectual disorder are encouraged more than children without an disability to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> internet. Except they are in general more vulnerable, so parents control their internet use more compared to children with a normal development...|$|R
