[...] Araya also denied rumors that Slayer members are Satanists, but they find the subject of Satanism interesting and [...] "we are all on this planet to learn and experience." ...|$|E

He goes inside, and overhears several teenagers gathered in the basement <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> each other {{with the story of}} Bletcher's murder. Black interrupts, scaring off the youths—and is again reminded of his past, recalling his reaction when Crocell was found to have committed suicide.

500|$|The band used Satanic {{themes in}} both lyrics and live {{performances}} to gain notice among the metal community. The back cover featured 'side 666' and inverted crosses, with Hanneman playing his guitar. Due to the imagery and lyrical content, Slayer received mail from the Parents Music Resource Center telling the band to stop releasing records. [...] Araya comments, [...] "Back {{then you had}} that PMRC, who literally took everything to heart. When in actuality you're trying to create an image. You're <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> people on purpose." [...] The album produced the songs [...] "The Antichrist", [...] "Die by the Sword", and [...] "Black Magic", which are played at Slayer's live shows regularly.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{learns that}} two celebrities have died {{recently}}—the obese man Pac-Man {{was based on}} and a famous clog dancer—and TGS writer Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) tells Tracy he should be careful because celebrity deaths tend to come in threes (the [...] "Rule of Three") and he might be next. Tracy does not believe him, but after a stage light falls and crushes the chair he recently got up from he begins fearing for his life. Tracy calls actress Betty White and screams into the phone, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> her to death, but is unsuccessful. He is nearly killed by comedic actor Jimmy Fallon, but is relieved when he learns that Pumpkin [...] "died".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. New Zealand actor Sam Neill guest starred in the episode as Molloy, the cat burglar. Executive producer David Mirkin thought Neill, a big The Simpsons fan, was [...] "lovely" [...] to direct. Mirkin also said Neill was [...] "really game" [...] and did [...] "a terrific job" [...] on the episode. Neill considers recording this episode to be a [...] "high-point" [...] of his career. One scene of the episode features Kent Brockman reporting on the burglaries. Mirkin {{said this was a}} joke the staff enjoyed doing because it pointed out how negative and mean-spirited news broadcasts can be, and how they are seemingly [...] "always <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> everybody" [...] by creating panic and depression.|$|E

500|$|During {{the dispute}} with Taylor over the High National Council in December, Khánh {{had tried to}} frame the dispute in {{nationalist}} terms, {{in an attempt to}} rally support around himself against what he saw as overbearing US influence. This worked for a while, as Taylor had angrily berated Khánh's generals, {{but in the long run}} it failed, as South Vietnam and the generals' careers and advancement were dependent on US aid. Taylor hoped Khánh's appeals to nationalism might backfire by causing his colleagues to fear a future without US funding. On occasions during the December stand-off, Khánh had appealed to his colleagues to support the expulsion of Taylor from the country. The ambassador said that US support for South Vietnam would end if he was expelled, and the generals backed down, but Khánh said the military did not need US aid. The Americans were aware of Khánh's tactics and exploited it by persistently <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> his colleagues with the prospect of a military heavily restricted by the absence of US funding. After the December coup, Taylor credited the fear of US abandonment for having [...] "raised the courage level of the other generals to the point of sacking him", as many were seen as beholden to their desire for personal advancement above all.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{begins with}} the Simpson family {{watching}} a news broadcast in which the news anchor Kent Brockman calls the United States Army a [...] "kill-bot factory". Mirkin {{said this was a}} joke the staff [...] "particularly loved to do" [...] because it pointed out how negative and mean-spirited news broadcasts can be, and how they are seemingly [...] "always <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> everybody" [...] by creating panic and depression. In one scene in the episode, Marge begins hallucinating after drinking from Springfield's water supply, which has been spiked with LSD by Springfield's rival town, Shelbyville. The Fox network's censors wanted the scene to be cut from the episode because they did not like the idea of Marge [...] "getting high" [...] on LSD. Mirkin, however, defended the scene and argued Marge was not [...] "doing it on purpose", so the censors ultimately allowed the scene to remain in the episode. In another scene, Homer becomes frustrated at God for not getting the tickets to the game, so yells at a waffle stuck to the ceiling that he believes is God. Marge points out to him, however, that it is just a waffle that Bart threw up there. This scene, inspired by some melted caramel stuck to the ceiling of the Simpsons writers' room, is one of Mirkin's and Richardson's [...] "all time favorite" [...] jokes.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the coup}} was a {{political}} success for Khánh, {{it was not enough}} to stabilize his leadership in the long run. During the dispute over the HNC, Khánh had tried to frame the dispute in nationalistic terms against what he saw as overbearing US influence. In the long run, this failed, as South Vietnam and the senior officers' careers and advancement were dependent on US aid. Taylor hoped Khánh's appeals to nationalism might backfire by causing his colleagues to fear a future without US funding. The Americans were aware of Khánh's tactics and exploited it by persistently <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> his colleagues with the prospect of a military heavily restricted by the absence of US funding. After the December coup, Taylor felt the fear of US abandonment [...] "raised the courage level of the other generals to the point of sacking" [...] Khánh, as many were seen as beholden above all to their desire for personal advancement. In January and February 1965, Khánh sensed he could no longer work with Taylor and the Americans, and that his support in the junta was unreliable, so he began to try to set up secret peace talks with the communists. Planning for discussions was only beginning, but this was unacceptable to the Americans and hardline anti-communists in the junta, as it meant the bombing campaign against North Vietnam would not be possible. When Khánh's plans were discovered, US-encouraged plotting intensified. On February 19–20, a coup occurred, and after the original plot was put down by the Young Turks, they forced Khánh into exile as well. With Khánh out of the way, the bombing campaign started.|$|E

2500|$|In The Hobbit, the {{inhabitants}} of the Misty Mountains who capture the Dwarves of Thorin's Company for trespassing, and later fight the Men, Elves and Dwarves at the Battle of the Five Armies, are identified as goblins, which is largely consistent with the use in The Book of Lost Tales. The term Orc does occur twice; once in an instance where Gandalf is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> Bilbo by mentioning creatures of the wilderness [...] "goblins, hobgoblins, and orcs of the worst description," [...] and again when the narrator mentions the large goblins ("great Orcs of the mountains"), {{as well as in the}} Elvish name of Thorin's sword, Orcrist.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{scored the}} game 7.6 out of 10, writing [...] "it {{might be a}} little too {{straightforward}} in spots, but it does make for a solid action game." [...] He concluded that [...] "although The Suffering tends to rely more on startling you with visual effects and sudden attacks than on actually <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> you, it's still a pretty refreshing take on horror-themed games. [...] more monsters, more ways to do them in, and perhaps some slightly more-involving puzzles would have probably made the game feel more in-depth. But even taking this into consideration, The Suffering is a fun action game." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1 December The Daily Telegraph ran a {{front page}} {{headline}} suggesting that Saudi Arabia {{had given the}} UK ten days to suspend the Serious Fraud Office investigation into BAE/Saudi Arabian transactions or they would take the deal to France, but this threat was played down in other quarters. [...] A French official had said [...] "the situation was complex and difficult... {{and there was no}} indication to suggest the Saudis planned to drop the Eurofighter." [...] This analysis was confirmed by Andrew Brookes, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, who said [...] "there could be an element here of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> the SFO off.

2500|$|A {{spokesperson}} for POM replied: [...] "If it is a hoax, it {{is a form}} of blackmail. If actual contamination has taken place, with the intention of injuring innocent people, it is an act of terrorism. Either way, the Animal Rights Militia is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> and intimidate innocent people. That is criminal behaviour." [...] It also said that the company conducted a vast amount of research involving human studies and that only a small amount of tests were animal based, which did not include dogs, cats or primates. The owners the following month then stated: [...] "POM Wonderful pomegranate juice has ceased all animal testing, and we have no plans {{to do so in the}} future." [...] This followed Whole Foods Market, the biggest grocery chain in natural stores, threatening to stop selling their products, initiated by the PETA campaign.|$|E
2500|$|... "Admiral Richard E.

The admiral explained that he was not <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a [...] recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking– recalled the admiral – {{is one of the most}} important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration. I have to warn my compatriots that the time has ended when we were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} Kent Brockman {{functions as}} The Simpsonss main character for news parodies. He {{was based on}} Los Angeles anchormen Hal Fishman and Jerry Dunphy, and modeled after anchorman Ted Koppel. Another influence on the character was The Mary Tyler Moore Shows Ted Baxter, played by Ted Knight. His role on The Simpsons is to host the news as the fictional television channel, Channel 6's anchorman. In addition to the news, he also hosts the programs Eye on Springfield and Smartline. In most of his appearances, he seems more interested in entertaining the viewers than informing them of real news. In [...] "Homer Loves Flanders" [...] Brockman calls the United States Army a [...] "kill-bot factory" [...] in a news broadcast. Mirkin {{said this was a}} joke the staff [...] "particularly loved to do" [...] because it pointed out how negative and mean-spirited news broadcasts can be, and how they are seemingly [...] "always <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> everybody" [...] by creating panic and depression. Turner said that [...] "in Brockman's journalism, we see some of the modern news media's ugliest biases", of which he says are glibness, amplification, and sensationalism. MSN called Brockman one of the worst TV news anchors. Brockman is joined by Scott Christian and Arnie Pie on the Channel 6 news team. Originally, Scott Christian was the anchor and Brockman was the field reporter, but the show shifted focus to Brockman. Arnie Pie is a helicopter-based traffic reporter that sometimes help with field reports other than traffic.|$|E
