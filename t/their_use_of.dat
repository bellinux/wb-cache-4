40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown an increased <b>use</b> <b>of</b> IT amongst young people. This has made it problematic for parents to set boundaries for <b>their</b> children's <b>use</b> <b>of</b> IT. The aim {{for this study was}} to create a deeper understanding of how parents relate to boundaries of IT, and how they monitor <b>their</b> children's <b>use</b> <b>of</b> it. This study was a qualitative study through semi-structured interviews to enable to capture the parents' experiences. The results showed that parents have boundaries but that there is a gap between the occurrence of boundaries and causes for boundaries. The study showed that parents monitor <b>their</b> children's <b>use</b> <b>of</b> IT but it is unclear whether the methods they use actually give them sufficient insight and knowledge regarding <b>their</b> children <b>use</b> <b>of</b> IT...|$|R

5|$|While {{the slaves}} lacked {{military}} training, Spartacus' forces displayed ingenuity in <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> available local materials, and in <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> clever, unorthodox tactics when facing the disciplined Roman armies. In response to Glaber's siege, Spartacus' men made ropes and ladders from vines and trees {{growing on the}} slopes of Vesuvius and used them to rappel down the cliffs {{on the side of the}} mountain opposite Glaber's forces. They moved around the base of Vesuvius, outflanked the army, and annihilated Glaber's men.|$|E
5|$|Forward Intelligence Teams (FITs) are two or {{more police}} {{officers}} who are deployed by UK police forces to gather intelligence {{on the ground and}} in some circumstances, to disrupt activists and deter anti-social behaviour. They use cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. An unsuccessful legal challenge has been made against <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> overt surveillance, but in 2009 the Court of Appeal ruled that they must justify retention of photographs on a case-by-case basis.

Crop varieties that are resistant to pests and diseases can reduce the need for application of harmfulpesticides.While crops that are more vigorous can better compete withweeds whichreduces the need for applyingherbicides. This is shown in a case study completed atAarhus Universityin Denmark which used more robust maize.Drought resistant plants can help save water and reduce the need forirrigation whiledeeper rooting varieties can help stabilize soils; and varieties that are more efficient in <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> nutrients require lessfertilizer.|$|E
5|$|Led Zeppelin's next album, Houses of the Holy, was {{released}} in March 1973. It featured further experimentation by the band, who expanded <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> synthesisers and mellotron orchestration. The predominantly orange album cover, designed by the London-based design group Hipgnosis, depicts images of nude children climbing the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Although the children are not shown from the front, the cover was controversial {{at the time of}} the album's release. As with the band's fourth album, neither their name nor the album title was printed on the sleeve.|$|E

Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the band's name and material.

A survey was sent to all women superintendents practicing in four Midwestern states during the 2000 - 2001 school year and nine women in the sample participated in interviews. Results of quantitative data analysis revealed that there were significant differences in participants 2 ̆ 7 age and years of experience in the superintendency and how they perceived <b>their</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> power.

5|$|Prokaryotes control <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> these {{electron}} {{donors and}} acceptors by varying which enzymes are produced, {{in response to}} environmental conditions. This flexibility is possible because different oxidases and reductases use the same ubiquinone pool. This allows many combinations of enzymes to function together, linked by the common ubiquinol intermediate. These respiratory chains therefore have a modular design, with easily interchangeable sets of enzyme systems.|$|E

5|$|Venice {{could not}} {{directly}} confront the large Ottoman expeditionary force on Crete, {{but it did}} possess a fine navy, that could intervene and cut the Ottoman supply routes. In 1645, the Venetians and their allies possessed a fleet of 60–70 galleys, 4 galleasses and about 36 galleons. The Venetians were also superior in <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a mixed fleet of both galleys and sailing ships, while initially, the Ottoman navy relied almost exclusively on galleys.

5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.|$|E

Raymond's workforce were enthusiastic in <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> this new material, likening it to the walls of traditional kura storehouses.

5|$|Alan Grant, {{a writer}} from Scotland, {{got his start}} on 2000 AD as an {{assistant}} writer for John Wagner. Grant rose to prominence as an equal of Wagner's {{in the creation of}} Judge Dredd comic strips. These stories were noted favorably for <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> socio-political commentary and satire. Together, the duo acquired employment with DC Comics. Dennis O'Neil assigned them to Detective Comics in 1988, hoping they would bring their gritty, violent take on Judge Dredd to Batman storylines. Soon after, Wagner left the company, leaving Grant to continue the run on his own. Drawing on his work for Judge Dredd, Grant began injecting social commentary into the comic book, and avoided using common Batman rogues in favor of his own creations. Some of these villains were influenced by characters from the Judge Dredd universe. Anarky was conceived singularly by Grant {{as a result of these}} circumstances, and Grant's own intellectual and philosophical meditations influenced the portrayal of the character over the following years.|$|E
