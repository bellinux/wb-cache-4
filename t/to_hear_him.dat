5|$|In 1896, William Jennings Bryan drew a {{crowd of}} 6,000 to Gladstone’s then 78-acre Chautauqua park <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> give his popular lecture, “The Prince of Peace”, which {{stressed}} that Christian theology, through both individual and group morality, was a solid foundation for peace and equality.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Indiana Senator Benjamin Harrison, {{grandson}} of territorial Governor William Henry Harrison, was elected President after an intense battle that attracted more than 300,000 partisans to Indianapolis <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> speak from his famous front porch. Fort Benjamin Harrison was named in his honor. Six Hoosiers {{have been elected}} as Vice-President. The most recent was Mike Pence, elected in 2016.|$|E
5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when preaching to a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women how they had enjoyed them, {{to be told that}} they had no real interest in the subject itself, but they loved <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> speak. The character of the college provost in the A Staircase in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was based on that of Chadwick.|$|E

5|$|Joseph {{was also}} {{unable to stop}} those who came <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> speak from desecrating the Sabbath, and his Yiddish sermons had {{no impact on the}} younger generation. In addition, he had to contend with a number of obstacles: he had no {{administrative}} experience or training, local Orthodox rabbis (particularly Joshua Seigel) and Jews outside his congregation did not accept his authority, and non-Orthodox Jews and groups criticized him. These problems were exacerbated by a stroke suffered in 1895, which partially incapacitated him, followed by a relapse in 1900 which left him bedridden.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{traditional}} account, Hanuman went to Valmiki numerous times <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> sing the Ramayana, but Valmiki turned down the request saying that Hanuman being a monkey was unworthy of hearing the epic. After the victory of Rama over Ravana, Hanuman went to the Himalayas to continue his worship of Rama. There he scripted a play version of the Ramayana called Mahanataka or Hanuman Nataka engraved on the Himalayan rocks using his nails. When Valmiki saw the play written by Hanuman, he anticipated that {{the beauty of the}} Mahanataka would eclipse his own Ramayana. Hanuman was saddened at Valmiki's state of mind and, being a true bhakta without any desire for glory, Hanuman cast all the rocks into the ocean, some parts of which are believed to be available today as Hanuman Nataka. After this, Valmiki was instructed by Hanuman to take birth as Tulsidas and compose the Ramayana in the vernacular.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{resignation}} from the Senate, Pierce {{had no intention}} of leaving public life. The move to Concord had given him more opportunities for cases, and allowed Jane a more robust community life. Jane had remained in Concord with her young son Frank and her newborn Benjamin for the latter part of Pierce's Senate term, and this separation had taken a toll on the family. Pierce, meanwhile, had begun a demanding but lucrative law partnership with Asa Fowler during congressional recesses. Pierce returned to Concord in early 1842, and his reputation as a lawyer continued to flourish. Known for his gracious personality, eloquence, and excellent memory, Pierce would attract large audiences <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> in court. He would often represent poor people for little or no compensation.|$|E

5|$|Seeing the {{positive}} reception by the female audience, Glenda tries to convince Deke {{to join the}} Tex Warner Show. Driving in Deke's hotrod, she tells him about his potential. Not willing to leave his first steady job in a year, he rejects the offer, but Glenda asks him to think about it. Upon returning to town, Glenda calls the Highway Beverage Company, after which she and Tex quit the Tallman campaign {{to return to their}} own roadshow. Later that night, Deke is provoked at a restaurant by the boyfriend of one of his fans, who wants <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> sing a song. After singing to a tune from the jukebox, he starts a fight with him. He is later exonerated by the police.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} term in the legislature, which met in the state capital of Nashville, Johnson did not {{consistently}} vote with either the Democratic or the newly formed Whig Party, though he revered President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat and Tennessean. The major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals, with the party system {{in a state of}} flux. The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson, fearing the concentration of power in the Executive Branch of the government; Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads, while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation. After Brookins Campbell and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re-election in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years. In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a Democrat and was elected. From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County. Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after the}} church opened the Methodist evangelist James Caughey spent {{four months in}} Kingston. Hundreds of people came <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> speak at the Sydenham Street Methodist Church, and {{it is said that}} he was {{directly}} responsible for almost four hundred conversions or experiences of sanctification.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{he moved}} to California. In 2008 in McKinney, Texas, near Dallas, he met Kanae Miyahara, the Mexican-born, Texas-based younger {{daughter}} of a Japanese agricultural engineer and a Mexican mother. She had come <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> give a motivational speech. They married on 12 February 2012. The couple has two sons and, as of June 2017, are expecting twin girls. They live in southern California.|$|E
25|$|Zeth Höglund, {{prisoner}} number 172, {{was released}} from Långholmen prison on 6 May 1917 after more than 13 months in prison. He was greeted by his friends, family {{and a couple of}} thousands workers who had gathered outside the prison. On the same day of his release, Höglund held a speech in a park in Stockholm, massing thousands of people <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> talk about peace, socialism and revolution.|$|E

50|$|Heenan later {{recovered}} from throat cancer, but lost {{a great deal}} of weight, dramatically changing his appearance and voice. Following early treatments, he spoke in a soft, high-pitched tone which contrasts noticeably with the tone fans were accustomed <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> use as a color commentator. He went from 246 lb to 190 lb or even less.|$|R

25|$|In July 1969, Taylor headlined a six-night {{stand at}} the Troubadour in Los Angeles. On July 20, he {{performed}} at the Newport Folk Festival as the last act and was cheered by thousands of fans who stayed in the rain <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him.</b> Shortly thereafter, he broke both hands and both feet in a motorcycle accident on Martha's Vineyard {{and was forced to}} stop playing for several months. However, while recovering, he continued to write songs and in October 1969 signed a new deal with Warner Bros. Records.|$|E
25|$|He made {{it clear}} that he also {{intended}} to argue against the suppression of the American Communist Party, and to use the committee as a platform for a call to transform World War II into a world revolution. Many of his supporters argued against his appearance. When the committee learned the nature of the testimony Trotsky intended to present, it refused <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him,</b> and he was denied a visa to enter the United States. On hearing about it, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union immediately accused Trotsky of being in the pay of the oil magnates and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.|$|E
25|$|His first {{professional}} appearance in London was opposite Agnes Nicholls, in Wallfahrt nach Kevlaar by Engelbert Humperdinck at the St James's Hall, with the Handel Society under J. S. Liddle in late April 1903, and immediately afterwards he {{appeared at the}} Westmorland Festival. In June 1903 he was auditioned at the Royal College of Music in London by Charles Villiers Stanford, who left the room and brought Hubert Parry in <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> as well. The violinist Professor Kruse, who was then attempting to revive the Saturday 'Pops' at the St James's Hall jumped {{out of his chair}} and promptly engaged him, and it was Kruse who arranged for his first appearance in Edward Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius early in 1904 as an addition to his Beethoven Festival. Harry Plunket Greene, who had encouraged Elwes through this audition, also remained his lifelong friend.|$|E

5000|$|Said pianist Martha Argerich, [...] "Sergio Monteiro is {{an artist}} with {{extraordinary}} creativity and energy. When he starts playing, music comes to life.

I strongly recommend him and I am looking forward <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> play again and again. It is pure joy and very stimulating".|$|R

25|$|Since casting Harley, however, Lloyd Webber {{had also}} begun to regret his artistic choices. As {{production}} continued on the show, {{the bulk of the}} score was revealing itself to be far more classical and operatic, entirely unsuited to Harley's rough, contemporary voice. Wanting instead a performer with a more classic, melodic voice, as described in the original book, he began yet another search for the perfect actor to play his Phantom. Crawford's landing of the role was due largely in part to the coincidence that Sarah Brightman, had taken lessons with the same vocal coach as Crawford. She and her husband had arrived early for her lesson, and it was while waiting that they chanced <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> practising a piece from Handel's Atalanta, namely the aria Care Selve. Intrigued, Lloyd Webber inquired of Mr. Adam as to the identity of his student. Soon after, Crawford was called in for an audition and was hired nearly on the spot.|$|E
25|$|Nahmanides is {{recorded}} as settling in the Old City of Jerusalem in 1267. He moved to Acre, {{where he was}} active in spreading Jewish learning, which {{was at that time}} neglected in the Holy Land. He gathered a circle of pupils around him, and people came in crowds, even from the district of the Euphrates, <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him.</b> Karaites were said to have attended his lectures, among them Aaron ben Joseph the Elder. He later became one of the greatest Karaite authorities. Shortly after Nahmanides' arrival in Jerusalem, he addressed a letter to his son Nahman, in which he described the desolation of the Holy City. At the time, it had only two Jewish inhabitants—two brothers, dyers by trade. In a later letter from Acre, Nahmanides counsels his son to cultivate humility, which he considers to be the first of virtues. In another, addressed to his second son, who occupied an official position at the Castilian court, Nahmanides recommends the recitation of the daily prayers and warns above all against immorality. Nahmanides died after reaching seventy-six, and his remains were interred at Haifa, by the grave of Yechiel of Paris.|$|E
25|$|In February 1622 John Donne {{resigned}} the preachership at Lincoln's Inn, and the benchers elected Preston as his successor. A new chapel, finished {{soon after}} his appointment, gave accommodation to the large numbers who flocked <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him.</b> A more important piece of preferment followed, {{but it was not}} obtained without intrigue. Laurence Chaderton, the first master of Emmanuel, had held that post with distinction for thirty-eight years. He had outlived his influential friends, and the fellows thought that to secure Preston's interest with Buckingham would be to the advantage of their college. In particular they wanted a modification of the statutes, which enjoined continuous residence, so cutting them off from chaplaincies and lectureships, {{and at the same time}} compelled them to vacate at the standing of D.D., whether otherwise provided or not. From Preston's influence they hoped to gain more liberty, as well as to increase the number of college livings. Chaderton thought highly of Preston, but was very reluctant to resign, and doubted whether, if he did, an Arminian might not be appointed. Preston procured a letter from Buckingham (20 September 1622) assuring Chaderton that it was the wish of the king and the prince that he should make way for Preston, and promising him a 'supply of maintenance'. Accordingly Chaderton resigned on 25 September; contrary to statute, the vacancy was not announced, on the plea that all the fellows were in residence; the election took place on 2 October with locked gates, and nothing was known of it at Queens' until Preston was sent for to be admitted as master of Emmanuel.|$|E
