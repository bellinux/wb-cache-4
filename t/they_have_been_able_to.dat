5|$|The northwestern {{slope of}} Kohala has few stream valleys cut into it, {{the result of}} the rain shadow effect, as the {{dominant}} trade winds bring most of the rainfall to the northeastern slope of the volcano. The seven windward valleys of Kohala are, from southeast to northwest, Waipio, Waimanu, Honopue, Honokea, Honokane Iki, Honokane Nui, and Pololu. The size of the valleys reflects the amount of drainage <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> capture; Waipio, the largest, at some point drained Waimanu Valley as well, and the former headwaters of Waimanu are now one of its branches. Waimanu valley, cut off from its headwaters to the summit and left with Wai'ilikahi as its main tributary, still had managed to form a substantial floodplain, although less than half the size of Waipio. Honokane Nui, the third largest valley, has its drainage almost exclusively from {{the north side of the}} summit, and as a result is a deep, long, narrow bottomed valley with little habitable floodplain.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the land}} {{assigned}} for sorghum cultivation by the Mechanized Farming Corporation had previously been used by pastoralists to graze their animals. One {{of a number of}} pastoral groups whose grazing grounds were encroached upon is the Rashaida in the Kassala area of eastern Sudan. This tribe emigrated from Saudi Arabia to the Sudan in the last century and, because of their relatively recent arrival, their territorial rights have been regarded as tenuous at best. However, as specialized camel breeders, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> adapt themselves well to the expansion of sorghum cultivation into their grazing grounds. By using sorghum byproducts to feed their camels, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> significantly increase food output per unit area.|$|E

25|$|The Lacandons are descendents of {{the ancient}} Maya. Since the 16th century, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> survive as a culture by living deep in the rainforest, with many {{communities}} out of contact {{with the rest of}} the world until the 20th century. Before the Conquest, the Lacandon dominated about a million hectares of these lands, but since then they have been encroached upon, mostly by indigenous from other areas of Chiapas since the early 20th century. This has dramatically altered their lifestyle and worldview. Today the Lacandon Maya are primarily found in three villages called Naja, Lacanja Chansayab and Metzobok. near the ruins of Bonampak and Yaxchilan. Local lore states that the gods resided here when they lived on earth.|$|E

25|$|Bluehole {{planned to}} port {{the game to}} consoles, which will be {{released}} sometime following {{the completion of the}} Windows release, with the company already having a team starting on the Xbox One port. Greene was part of Microsoft's press conference during Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017 to announce that Battlegrounds would be coming to Xbox One as a timed console exclusive sometime by the end of 2017. Kim says they anticipate using the Xbox Game Preview early access approach to roll out and test the game on the Xbox One console. Initially, Greene said that Microsoft was not directly involved in the porting but only providing assistance to make sure the port is good, and that most of the porting responsibilities are being done by Anticto, a Spanish developer. However, at Gamescom that year, Bluehole affirmed that Microsoft Studios would be publishing the Xbox One version of the title, helping to make a planned 2017 release for this version. Greene said that Microsoft's support has helped in several ways, not only for the Xbox One version but improving the performance and security of the Windows version. Further, by being part of the group of studios under the Microsoft banner, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> talk and incorporate technology from other developers, such as improved water rendering techniques they obtained from Rare that they had developed for Sea of Thieves. The Xbox One release will initially start as an early access title in the Xbox Game Preview program on December 12, 2017, and when finalized, will include a physical release alongside digital availability, and will be released on December 12, 2017.|$|E
