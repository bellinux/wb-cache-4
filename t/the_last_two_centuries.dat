50|$|Indeed, {{within the}} century of Shin Arahan's death, the Buddhism of Pagan would be realigned with the Mahavihara school of Ceylon, {{away from his}} Conjeveram-Thaton school. (The Conjeveram school {{originated}} in Kanchipuram, Tamil nadu in 5th century AD, based on the writings of monk Dhammapala.) By 1192, the Mahavihara school became the predominant school of Burmese Buddhism by the efforts of Shin Uttarajiva.

5|$|Only three Sinhala books survive {{from the}} Anuradhapura period.

Dampiya Atuva Gatapadaya is another, and is a {{glossary}} for the Pali Dhammapadatthakatha, providing Sinhala words and synonyms for Pali words. The third book is Mula Sikha Ha Sikhavalanda, a set of disciplinary rules for Buddhist monks.

5|$|Scotland {{also has}} {{numerous}} vitrified forts but again an accurate chronology {{has proven to}} be evasive. Extensive studies of such a fort at Finavon Hill near Forfar in Angus, using a variety of techniques, suggest dates for the destruction of the site in either <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> or the mid-1st millennium. The lack of Roman artifacts (common in local souterrain sites) suggests that many sites were abandoned before the arrival of the legions.|$|E
5|$|The {{area has}} been a major focus of modern Egyptological {{exploration}} for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>centuries.</b> Prior to this time it was a site for tourism in antiquity (especially during Roman times).

40|$|By {{using the}} sunspot time series as a proxy, {{we have made}} a {{detailed}} analysis of the mean solar magnetic field over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> and half <b>centuries,</b> by means of a reconstruction of its phase space. We find evidence of a long-term trend variation of some of the solar physical processes (over a few decades) that might be responsible for the apparent erratic behaviour of the solar magnetic cycle. The analysis is done by means of a careful study of the axisymmetric dynamo model equations, where we show that the temporal counterpart of the magnetic field can be described by a self-regulated two-dimensional dynamic system, usually known as a Van der Pol-Duffing oscillator. Our results suggest that during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> and half <b>centuries,</b> <b>the</b> velocity of the meridional flow, vp, and the efficiency of the α mechanism responsible for the conversion of toroidal magnetic field into poloidal magnetic field might have suffered variations that can explain the observed variability in the solar cycle...|$|R
5000|$|The quarrel {{became a}} schism: those who derived their {{ordination}} from Shin Arahan {{were known as}} the Former Order; those who derived it from Ceylon were known as the Latter Order. The king supported the new movement. More and more monks were sent to Ceylon where they received ordination at the ancient Mahavihara Monastery. [...] Shin Uttarajiva died in October 1191 (right {{around the end of}} Buddhist Lent). By then, the Mahavihara school became the predominant school of Burmese Buddhism. Shin Chapata also returned from Ceylon right after his teacher's death, and carried on his teacher's reformation effort. But the old order did not yield easily. <b>The</b> schism <b>lasted</b> <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> before Conjeveram Buddhism finally died out.|$|R
5|$|The most {{important}} breeding populations in Europe, in Russia and Sweden are stable, and the breeding range in Norway {{has expanded to}} the south, but populations have more than halved in Finland, Poland, Latvia and The Netherlands. Although the small populations in these countries are of limited overall significance, the decline {{is a continuation of}} trend towards range contraction that has occurred over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>centuries.</b> The drop in numbers in Europe has been attributed to drainage, increased fertiliser use, the loss of formerly mown or grazed breeding sites and over-hunting.|$|E
5|$|The habitat {{includes}} {{various kinds}} of wetlands, such as lakes, marshes, and rivers. Oryzomys species swim well, are active during the night, and eat both plant and animal food. They build woven nests of vegetation. After a gestation period of 21 to 28days, about four young are born. Species of Oryzomys are infected by numerous parasites and carry at least three hantaviruses, one of which (Bayou virus) also infects humans. Two, maybe three, species have gone extinct over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> {{and at least one}} other is endangered, but the widespread marsh rice rat and O.couesi are not threatened.|$|E
5|$|Sugar was {{a luxury}} in Europe until the 18th century, {{when it became}} more widely available. It then became popular and by the 19th century, sugar came to be {{considered}} a necessity. This evolution of taste and demand for sugar as an essential food ingredient unleashed major economic and social changes. It drove, in part, colonization of tropical islands and nations where labor-intensive sugarcane plantations and sugar manufacturing could thrive. The demand for cheap labor to perform the hard work involved in its cultivation and processing increased the demand for the slave trade from Africa (in particular West Africa). After slavery was abolished, there was high demand for indentured laborers from South Asia (in particular India). Millions of slave and indentured laborers were brought into the Caribbean and the Americas, Indian Ocean colonies, southeast Asia, Pacific Islands, and East Africa and Natal. The modern ethnic mix of many nations that have been settled in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> has been influenced by the demand for sugar.|$|E

5|$|A major {{reform to}} the Court {{happened}} {{soon after the}} restoration, {{with the introduction of}} a right of appeal to the House of Lords from the Chancery. Before this there had been no records of appeals to the Lords, and a committee had concluded that there was no precedent to give the Lords jurisdiction over equity matters, except when problems and cases were sent directly to Parliament (as occasionally had been the case). In 1660 the Convention Parliament claimed for itself the right of appellate jurisdiction over equity matters, and also the right of original jurisdiction to hear equity cases at first instance. After disputes which lasted into the next Parliament, this second measure was dropped, but the right to hear equity appeals was confirmed. Horowitz writes that despite these changes, one of the academic certainties is that the problems which had dogged the court for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> persisted; Observations on the Dilatory and Expensive Proceedings in the Court of Chancery, written in 1701, listed 25 different procedures, areas and situations which contributed to the problems of high fees and slow processes.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{numerous}} vitrified forts, {{the walls of}} which have been subjected to fire, which may date to this period, but an accurate chronology has proven to be evasive. When first noted in the nineteenth century it was assumed that vitrification had been deliberately undertaken as part of the building process to harden walls, but this hypothesis was rejected by V. Gordon Childe in the 1940s and subsequent excavations have indicated that, since the debris from such walls fell on the deposits of occupation it could not {{have been part of the}} building process. Reconstructions have indicated the difficulty of deliberately firing timbers in this way, particularly in the prevailing climatic conditions in Scotland, and it is more likely that this was done as part of a process of fort destruction, either after conquest or when abandoned by the inhabitants. Extensive studies of such a fort at Finavon Hill near Forfar in Angus, suggest dates for the destruction of the site in either <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> BCE, or the mid-first millennium CE. Excavations at Dunnideer, Aberdeenshire indicate a date for its destruction in the period 500–250 BCE.|$|E

50|$|The {{decline in}} {{anadromous}} salmonid species over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> to three <b>centuries</b> is {{correlated with the}} decline in the North American beaver and European beaver, although some fish and game departments continue to advocate removal of beaver dams as potential barriers to spawning runs. Migration of adult Atlantic salmon may be limited by beaver dams during periods of low stream flows, but the presence of juvenile Salmo salar upstream from the dams suggests the dams are penetrated by parr. Downstream migration of Atlantic salmon smolts was similarly unaffected by beaver dams, even in periods of low flows.|$|R

After World War II an alternative Reggio Emilia approach to early-childhood education was developed in Italy, introduced by Loris Malaguzzi.|$|R
