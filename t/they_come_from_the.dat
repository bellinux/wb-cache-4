5|$|The three episodes {{were tied}} {{together}} by {{the story of a}} murdered Haitian domestic worker employed by wealthy philanthropist Felix Wilson, played by Jones. Protagonists Frank Pembleton and Al Giardello initially refuse to properly investigate the Wilson family out of respect for their success and contributions to the African American community of Baltimore, which leads to tensions and accusations of discrimination within the police department. The storyline serves as a rumination and commentary on racism and classism, even when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> best of intentions.|$|E
5|$|In 1802, {{shortly after}} {{discovering}} Pallas, Olbers suggested to Herschel that Ceres and Pallas were fragments {{of a much}} larger planet that once occupied the Mars–Jupiter region, this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before. Over time, however, this hypothesis has fallen from favor. The large amount of energy required to destroy a planet, combined with the belt's low combined mass, which is only about 4% of the mass of the Moon, do not support the hypothesis. Further, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids become difficult to explain if <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same planet. Today, most scientists accept that, rather than fragmenting from a progenitor planet, the asteroids never formed a planet at all.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{comes from}} frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring {{long periods of}} precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. These warm air masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north or northwest {{as a result of}} a trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, warm air masses from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air. These warm air masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the warmest air masses, leading to the warmest temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air from the north is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived.|$|E

25|$|Concerning social housing, {{there are}} several organisations which are the Public Housing Office of Valence (OPH) and Housing Development of Drôme (DAH) who construct, {{maintain}} and manage social housing throughout the city and in the Valence agglomeration, most are located in so-called working-class quarters.

25|$|Many objects {{recovered}} by archeologists {{are believed}} to be related to a cult of the sun and the solar deity. Those include ceramics with painted solar images and molded into bird figures, bronze wheeled mini-carts with animal ornaments and bronze clasps with bird images, probably worn as parts of a ceremonial robe by priests-sorcerers. Anthropomorphic figurines and zoomorphic containers and plates related to solar or other forms of cult are found in the Lusatian western zone; <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> last centuries of the Bronze Age and continue into the Iron Age. Engraved on a vase-urn found in Łazy in Milicz County and dated 850–650 BC are representations of mythical deer-man figures. Some such vessels, jewelry and drawings have their contemporary counterparts in Assyria, ancient Israel, Archaic Greece and Etruria, which shows the breadth of Lusatian trade and other contacts. A panpipe (syrinx), a musical instrument of the type popular in northern Italy and eastern Hallstatt circles, was found in a grave in Przeczyce near Zawiercie from the late bronze or early iron periods.|$|E

2500|$|The {{manuscript}} once contained evangelist portraits for {{all four}} Evangelists, preceding their gospel, a usual feature of illuminated Gospel books, and at least three further pages of narrative scenes, one following each portrait page.

2500|$|The Founding of Caunus: two {{comments}} in Parthenius's Love Stories {{are the only}} testament to this poem {{but they seem to}} give conflicting accounts. According to one, it deals with the story of Lyrcus; according to the other, it deals with the story of Byblis. This might indicate a loose, episodic structure, rather than a unified narrative. It might then be inferred that this kind of treatment was typical of his other foundation poems as well (the question of unity {{is one of the main}} issues even in Argonautica, which is sometimes termed an [...] "episodic epic"). Five hexameter verses attributed to Apollonius may be a fragment of this poem but they seem unrelated to the stories of Lyrcus and Byblis and some scholars think <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> next poem.|$|E

2500|$|The CMST {{researchers}} believe that the most likely explanation of the hydroacoustic data is that <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same event, but unrelated to Flight 370. They note that [...] "the characteristics of the [...] are not unusual, it is only their arrival time {{and to some extent}} the direction from which they came that make them of interest". If the data relates to the same event, related to Flight 370, but the arc derived from analysis of the aircraft's satellite transmission is incorrect, then the most likely place to look for the aircraft would be along a line from HA01 at a bearing of 301.6° until that line reaches the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge (approximately 2.3°S, 73.7°E). In the latter possibility, if the acoustic recordings are from the impact of the aircraft with the ocean, they likely came from a location where water is less than 2,000m deep and the seabed slopes downwards towards the east or southeast; if they came from debris imploding at depth, the source location along this line is much less certain. The lead CMST researcher believed the chance the acoustic event was related to Flight 370 to be very slim, perhaps as low as 10%. The audio recording of the suspect detection was publicly released on 4 June 2014; the ATSB had first referenced these signals in a document posted on its website on 26 May.|$|E
2500|$|The primary ethical {{dilemma that}} is {{brought up in}} stem cell {{research}} is concerning the source of embryonic stem cells (hESCs). As the name states, hESCs come from embryos. To be more specific, <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inner cell mass of a blastophere, which is the beginning stage of an embryo. However, that mass of cells could {{have the potential to}} give rise to human life, and there in lies the problem. Often, this argument leads back to a similar moral debate held around abortion. The question is: when does a mass of cells gain personhood and autonomy? Some individuals believe that an embryo is in fact a person at the moment of conception and that using an embryo for anything other than creating a baby would essentially be killing a baby. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum, people argue that the small ball of cells at that point only has the potential to become a fetus, and that potentiality, even in natural conception, is far from guaranteed. According to a study done by developmental biologists, between 75–80% of embryos created through intercourse are naturally lost before they can become fetuses. This debate is not one that has a right or wrong answer, nor can it be clearly settled. [...] Much of the ethical dilemma surrounding hESCs relies on individual beliefs about life and the potential for scientific advancement versus creating new human life.|$|E
