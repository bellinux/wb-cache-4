5|$|Casualties {{during the}} {{fighting}} around Isurava have been variously reported. In the immediate post war era, Australian sources tended {{to report a}} ratio of around five Japanese killed for every one Australian, with the Australians estimating that they had killed around 700 Japanese; however, in recent times this has been revised. The Japanese also initially over-estimated the casualties they inflicted on the Australians, claiming 1,000 killed, before reducing this to 300. It is now thought that the casualties were more even, although still favouring the Australians. For the Australians, casualties are now reported as 99 killed and 111 wounded while <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> thought to have lost 140 killed and 231 wounded.|$|E

25|$|As both Korea and Taiwan {{had been}} under the {{domination}} of Japan for an indefinite amount of time, many citizens of both territories were forced to work under the Japanese military and experienced violence for a long time.

25|$|The Japanese {{had major}} {{prisoner}} of war (POW) camps at Kuching, Ranau, and Sandakan, plus smaller ones at Dahan and other locations. Batu Lintang camp held both military and civilian prisoners. The camp was finally liberated on 11 September 1945 by the 9th Australian Army Division {{under the command of}} Brigadier Tom Eastick. Sandakan camp was also closed by the Japanese prior to the Allied invasion; with most of its occupants {{died as a result of}} forced marches from Sandakan to Ranau. In total, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> believed to have held an estimated 4,660 prisoners and internees at all camps in northern Borneo, with only 1,387 managed to survived in Batu Lintang camp and only six in the forced marches until the end of the war.|$|E

Multilevel random coefficient modeling analyses found that <b>the</b> self_esteem of <b>Japanese</b> participants changed more in reaction to daily social events (both positive and negative) than it did for North American participants. For positive social events, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> more reactive in terms of positive affect than North Americans. For negative social events, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> more reactive in terms of depressed mood (ND) and deactive positive affect (PD) than North Americans. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> less reactive to negative achievement events than North Americans in terms of PA and anxious mood. <b>The</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> more reactive than North Americans to positive achievement events in terms of PA and ND. The results highlight the greater sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> to social concerns compared to North Americans, and the greater affective sensitivity of North Americans to failure in achievement domains...|$|R

500|$|The Langlois Bridge {{reminded}} Van Gogh of Hiroshige's print [...] [...] Inspired by the Japanese {{wood block}} prints, Van Gogh sought to integrate techniques from Japanese artwork into his own. In {{a letter to}} Émile Bernard about the Langlois Bridge, he wrote: [...] "If <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> not making any progress in their own country, still it cannot be doubted that their art is being continued in France." [...] With a Japanese aesthetic, Van Gogh's Langlois Bridge paintings reflect a simplified use of color to create a harmonious and unified image. [...] Outlines were used to suggest movement. He used fewer shades of colors, preferring multiple subtle color variations. The Langlois Bridge reminded Van Gogh of Hiroshige's Sudden Shower on the Great Bridge inspiring him to use blocks of colors, like patterns of yellow against a blue sky, colors chosen {{to create a sense}} of vitality of the Japanese prints and the vibrant quality of light in [...] southern France. These approaches created a more powerful impact and depicted the simpler, primitive quality of the country lifestyle.|$|E
500|$|The atomic {{bombings of}} Hiroshima and Nagasaki are {{identified}} {{as the cause of}} Japanese whaling.

In [...] "Whale Whores", <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> presented with a doctored picture of the Enola Gay, the B-29 Superfortress bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.

Near the end of the episode, Stan and the crew of the MY Steve Irwin encounter fishing ship captain Sig Hansen and his crew from the Discovery Channel reality series, Deadliest Catch. The scene with Paul Watson's crew throwing [...] "stinky butter" [...] at the whalers refers to Watson and his crew's practice of throwing stink bombs containing butyric acid, an acid found in rancid butter and cheese, at Japanese whaling vessels, including the factory vessel, the Nisshin Maru.|$|E
