25|$|On rare occasions, blood {{products}} are contaminated with bacteria. This {{can result in}} a life-threatening infection known as transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection. The risk of severe bacterial infection is estimated, as of 2002, at about 1 in 50,000 platelet transfusions, and 1 in 500,000 red blood cell transfusions. Blood product contamination, while rare, is still more common than actual infection. The reason platelets are more often contaminated than other {{blood products}} is that they are stored at room temperature for short periods of time. Contamination is also more common with longer duration of storage, especially if <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>more</b> than 5 days. Sources of contaminants include the donor's blood, donor's skin, phlebotomist's skin, and containers. Contaminating organisms vary greatly, and include skin flora, gut flora, and environmental organisms. There are many strategies in place at blood donation centers and laboratories {{to reduce the risk of}} contamination. A definite diagnosis of transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection includes the identification of a positive culture in the recipient (without an alternative diagnosis) as well as the identification of the same organism in the donor blood.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{reviewed}} the episode, simply saying he [...] "loved this episode," [...] {{giving it a}} perfect 10 out of 10 score. Canning enjoyed Jack and Devon's back-and-forth, and wrote that Jenna and Tracy [...] "tormenting" [...] Liz in their separate ways were [...] "equally gratifying." [...] Meredith Blake, a contributor from the Los Angeles Times opined, [...] "To all those haters who say 30 Rock is losing its touch, I say 'poppycock!' [...] was proof that the show is as zippy as ever." [...] She noted that Jack's plot [...] "didn't make {{a whole lot of}} sense", nonetheless [...] "anything <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>more</b> Will Arnett on 30 Rock is fine by me." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad reported it was great to see Jack and NBC [...] "still being affected by the economy, government bailouts, and Washington hearings". Sassone much preferred [...] "Into the Crevasse" [...] than [...] "Season 4". New York magazine contributor Mark Graham said this episode of 30 Rock saw the series [...] "once again hitting a familiar, meta-flavored stride, as Tina Fey and her writing staff tried a 'ripped from the headlines' approach and took on recent real-life story lines like the 30 Rock porno". [...] "The return of Will Arnett, the existence of a Porn Liz, and one deal breaker after another: 'Into the Crevasse' had some killer lines, even if it didn't come together in one big narrative", remarked Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly. In his recap, TV Guides [...] Michael Anthony said that the Jack and Devon characters [...] "really [...] how to put a playful spin" [...] on the bail out and government money story.|$|E
500|$|Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad {{said that}} he was not certain if [...] "this was a great 30 Rock episode" [...] but that it [...] "had all of the {{elements}} that make the good ones: funny one-liners and Liz and Jack both looking for something better in their lives." [...] He was complimentary towards Matt Damon's appearance, writing that he [...] "was {{one of the best things}} about this season finale episode", but admitted he could not see Damon [...] "being Liz's boyfriend or husband next season." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin wrote that he enjoyed Kenneth's rant against his former co-workers, and said that this episode [...] "was a terrific end to a season that wobbled for a while but ended strongly." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste magazine said that Kenneth's story was [...] "an enjoyable diversion". In regard to the finale, itself, Gandert noted that it was [...] "pretty good, but not outstanding, which is a fitting way to conclude a season that never quite hit its stride but was still consistently entertaining." [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Emily Exton noted that Damon's character was a [...] "perfect match" [...] for Liz. Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, wrote that Damon was [...] "perfectly Damon-esque". Blake reported that she had been rooting for the Avery character since first appearing in the series, but acknowledged [...] "that there's something undeniably sweet about Jack and Nancy." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning complimented Julianne Moore's performance, writing that she was [...] "engaging". Canning said that Kenneth and Jenna's plots [...] "added more hilarity to the episode" [...] and that on their own [...] "these storylines [...] very entertaining. But combine them into one fantastic, fast and funny half hour and you're left with near perfection." [...] Alexandra Martell of New York magazine said that Avery's pregnancy was [...] "going to drive much of next season, but if <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>more</b> Elizabeth Banks, we're cool." [...] Martell wrote that Kenneth getting fired was a [...] "nice twist", but that [...] "the highlight" [...] of [...] "I Do Do" [...] was Jenna discovering Paul dressing up as Cher. TV Guides Adam Mersel opined that the [...] "biggest twist in the series' history" [...] was Nancy revealing that Avery was pregnant.|$|E

60|$|But farther, {{that this}} {{discontinuity}} of parts {{is the principal}} Cause of the opacity of Bodies, will appear by considering, that opake Substances become transparent by filling their Pores with any Substance of equal or almost equal density with their parts.

And to the increase of the opacity of these Bodies, it conduces something, that by the 23d Observation the Reflexions of very thin transparent Substances are considerably stronger than those made by the same Substances of a greater thickness.|$|E
