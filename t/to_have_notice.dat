But as I have said, I think not that there is any chance of their {{beginning}} in such a way; it will be only after they have encountered the troops, and blood has been shed." ...|$|E
60|$|But my {{case was}} particular; {{it was by}} no means proper to me to go thither without money or goods, and for a poor convict, that was to be sold as soon as I came on shore, to carry with me a cargo of goods would be <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>notice</b> taken of it, and perhaps to have them seized by the public; so I took part of my stock with me thus, and left the other part with my governess.|$|E

60|$|During {{all this}} Herbert could hardly {{think of his}} own fate and fortune, though, indeed, he could hardly think of {{anything}} else. He was eager to be alone, that he might think, and was nearly broken-hearted when the second bottle of 34 made its appearance. Something, however, was arranged in those intercalary moments between the raising of the glasses. Mr. Prendergast {{said that he would}} write both to Owen Fitzgerald and to Mr. Somers; and it was agreed that Herbert should immediately return to Castle Richmond, merely giving his mother time <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>notice</b> of his coming.|$|E

"I understand," [...] said she, [...] "that you {{are trying}} to get hot water out of your well, and that there {{is likely to be a}} lot more than you need, so that it will run down by the side of the road. I just want to say that if a stream of hot water comes down past my house some of the {{children}} will be bound to get into it and be scalded to death, and I came to say that if that well is going to squirt b'iling water I'd like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>notice</b> so that I can move, though where a widow with so many orphans is going to move to nobody knows. Mr. Colwell says that if you had got him to tell you where to put that well there would have been no danger of this sort of thing." ...|$|E

A huge {{world of}} smoky chaos; the special fires of it, if there be {{anything}} of fire, {{are all the}} more clear far in the distance. Of which sort, and of which only, the reader is <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>notice.</b> Marechal de Saxe--King Louis oftenest personally there, {{to give his name}} and countenance to things done--is very glorious in the Netherlands; captures, sometimes by surprisal, place after place (beautiful surprisal of Brussels last winter); with sieges of Antwerp, Mons, Charleroi, victoriously following upon Brussels: and, before the end of 1746, he is close upon Holland itself; intent on having Namur and Maestricht; for which the poor Sea-Powers, with a handful of Austrians, fight two Battles, and are again beaten both times. [1. Battle of Roucoux, 11th October, 1746; Prince Karl commanding, English taking mainly the stress of fight;--Saxe having already outwitted poor Karl, and got Namur. 2. Battle of Lawfelt, or Lauffeld, called also of VAL, 2d July, 1747; Royal Highness of Cumberland commanding (and taking most of the stress; Ligonier made prisoner, &c.),--Dutch fighting ill, and Bathyani and his Austrians hardly in the fire at all.] A glorious, ever-victorious Marechal; and has an Army very [...] "high-toned," [...] in more than one sense: indeed, I think, one of the loudest-toned Armies ever on the field before. Loud not with well-served Artillery alone, but with play-actor Thunder-barrels (always an itinerant Theatre attends), with gasconading talk, with orgies, debaucheries,--busy service of the Devil, AND pleasant consciousness that we are Heaven's masterpiece, and are in perfect readiness to die at any moment;--our ELASTICITY and agility ("ELAN" [...] as we call it) well kept up, in that manner, for the time being.|$|E

5000|$|Lord Millett, writing extrajudicially, {{has also}} criticised the decision, stating [...] "It {{is easy to}} agree with Lord Browne-Wilkinson that Chase Manhatten v Israel-British Bank was wrong decided, but it was wrongly decided not because {{transferee}} had no notice of the transferor's claim ... but because the claimant had no proprietary interest for it <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>notice</b> of." ...|$|E

5000|$|It is {{important}} to note that the presence of a lis pendens does not prevent or necessarily invalidate a transfer of the property, although it makes such a transfer subject to the outcome of the litigation. Thus, the owner is not prevented from selling the land for (non-borrowed) cash, pledging it as security for a speculative loan, or giving it away, all subject to the outcome of the lawsuit. However, once the lis pendens is recorded, the recipient (a [...] "purchaser" [...] or [...] "grantee pendente lite") would be deemed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>notice</b> of the litigation and might lose their title to the property if the plaintiff's suit prevails.|$|E
50|$|In the US {{very few}} states have laws that {{specifically}} permit district attorneys to allow private collection agencies to collect checks {{in the district}} attorney's name. About half of all U.S. states offer some type of Bad Check Restitution Program, and these services vary in many ways. Some accept non-sufficient funds (NSF), and closed account checks while others may accept stopped payment checks and markers. It will {{also be noted that}} most have time limits (checks may need to be less than 90 or 180 days old and most need to be at least 30 days old and have had <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>notice</b> to check maker that the check has been returned unpaid with a demand for payment in a specified time). Some will not accept checks that were written under certain circumstances, including a post-dated check, one that the check writer asked the recipient to hold, or one that was written as an extension of credit.|$|E
40|$|Criminal law norms {{assume that}} all {{defendants}} are alike. But social science {{research has demonstrated that}} most defendants with mental retardation are unlike their peers of average intelligence in their cognitive and behavioral capacity, a difference with profound effects on their blameworthiness. The law acknowledges this difference in a few limited areas, most notably in the Supreme Court’s categorical exclusion of defendants with mental retardation from the death penalty. But while that decision has begun to percolate into the rest of criminal law, it has not yet reached the law of statutory rape. When prosecuted as a strict liability offense, statutory rape precludes the fact-finder from considering the defendant’s state of mind altogether. The total exclusion of mens rea is an anomaly in criminal law, where a finding of guilt typically requires proof not only of an “evil act,” but also of an “evil mind. ” Commentators have criticized the strict liability doctrine, but have ignored how the standard is especially unjust when applied to defendants with mental retardation. A close analysis of statutory rape law reveals certain assumptions which allow such a low standard of proof for such a significant offense: would-be defendants are presumed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>notice</b> that sex with underage partners is unlawful; to be {{in the best position to}} prevent any harm from occurring; and to be deviant, immoral aggressors. When examined in light of research about mental retardation, however, these assumptions collapse. Indeed, punishing a person with mental retardation without regard to his awareness of the law, social cues, and the nature of his conduct may also run afoul of constitutional due process and proportionate sentencing principles. This article therefore argues that the prosecution of statutory rape should be modified for defendants with mental retardation. The government should have to prove that a defendant with mental retardation had the mens rea to commit the offense. In addition, this article recommends formalizing the existing ways of addressing the difference in culpability of this population through charging and sentencing. The failure to account for defendants’ mental retardation in the context of statutory rape provides just one example of the theoretical and constitutional problems when criminal law disregards people who cannot comprehend the significance of their conduct...|$|E
