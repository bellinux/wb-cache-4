40|$|Subject of {{this work}} is the {{implementation}} of the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism into the Russian legislation. The Convention is called upon to fill the gap in the international instruments on terrorism matter existed at the moment by obliging state-parties to prohibit certain offences possibly leading to the commission of terrorism, namely public provocation to commit <b>terrorist</b> <b>offence,</b> training and recruitment for terrorism. Beside it the Convention is aimed at enhancing the co-operation between states in fighting terrorism. The overall goal {{of this work}} is to show how the requirements of the Convention were met in Russian legislation and assess how successful was the implementation of particular provisions of the Conventions by Russia. As a result of ratification of the Conventions relevant legislative acts were amended in order to fulfil the obligations under the Convention.

40|$|This report {{reviews the}} {{appropriateness}} {{and effectiveness of}} Australia 2 ̆ 7 s national security legislation, focusing on the legal definition of terrorism and on controversial powers such as control orders, preventative detention and coercive questioning. Key findings:Chapter II concludes that control orders in their present form are not effective, not appropriate and not necessary. It suggests {{that they may be}} effective, would be appropriate and might be regarded as necessary in the case of persons already convicted of terrorist offences whose dangerousness at the expiry of their sentences of imprisonment can be shown. Chapter III concludes the preventative detention orders are not effective, not appropriate and not necessary. They should simply be abolished. Chapter IV concludes that questioning warrants are sufficiently effective to be appropriate, and in a relevant sense necessary. Further, it suggests they might be more readily available than the legislation currently provides. It rejects the criticism that questioning warrants are an unjustified infringement of liberty. Chapter V concludes that questioning and detention warrants are an unnecessary extension of questioning warrants. But the reasoning for that conclusion does not suggest detention for the purposes of questioning is wrong. Rather, it is appropriately and proportionately comprehended within the counter-terrorism laws provisions for questioning warrants. Chapter VI proposes improvements to Australia’s definition of terrorism. The current requirement for the separate proof of a political, religious or ideological motivation in order that a person be guilty of a <b>terrorist</b> <b>offence</b> is not effective, not appropriate and not necessary.

40|$|The {{debate on}} the government’s legal {{response}} to September 11 shows how bad laws can emerge from hasty decisions made in times of danger, according to George Williams, {{the director of the}} Gilbert & Tobin Centre of Public Law at the University of New South Wales. This article is based on his contribution to the conference, ‘The War on Terrorism’: Democracy Under Challenge, held in Melbourne on 9 August. MY STARTING point may be different from that of some people here. I believe that the federal parliament should enact new anti-terrorism laws. After September 11, such laws are required from the perspective of community confidence and also to fulfill Australia’s international obligations. Before September 11, there were no federal laws dealing specifically with terrorism (in fact such laws could only be found in the Northern Territory). While we need a national legislative response to terrorism, any new laws must strike a balance between national defence and security, and important public values and fundamental human rights. We must not pass laws that damage the same democratic freedoms we are seeking to protect from terrorism. My paper today addresses whether the government’s legislative response to September 11 has achieved the right balance. I argue that it has clearly failed to do so. In fact, the bills introduced in March 2002 into parliament pose as great a threat to Australian democracy as Prime Minister Robert Menzies’ attempt to ban communism in 1950. If passed, the new terrorism bills may do more to undermine the long term health of our democratic system than any threat currently posed by terrorism. I will begin with an examination of the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 (Terrorism Bill). That bill has now been enacted by Parliament, but only after being substantially amended to meet a number of objections. I then examine the ASIO Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 (ASIO Bill), which has yet to be passed and arguably poses the greater threat to our democratic system. THE FIRST package of anti-terrorism legislation comprised five bills. The bills failed to pass in their original form and were substantially amended after a highly critical and unanimous report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and advocacy by the legal and community sectors. The most important of the first bills was the Terrorism Bill. It defined ‘terrorist act’ as an act or threat that: • involves serious harm to a person or serious damage to property; or • endangers another’s life or creates a serious risk to public health or safety; • seriously interferes with, disrupts or destroys an electronic system; and • is done ‘with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause’. This definition lacked a focus on the ultimate intent of the terrorist act or, put another way, what distinguishes terrorist violence from offences or forms of violence covered in other acts. The definition was so wide that it would have criminalised (with life imprisonment) many forms of civil protest. For example, farmers, unionists or other protesters marching, blockading or mass e-mailing could fall within the definition (the legislation excepted only lawful advocacy, protest or dissent). This aspect of the bill has been amended. The definition of ‘terrorist act’ as enacted includes a new element: the action is done or the threat is made with the intention of: 	(i) 	coercing, or influencing by intimidation, the government of the Commonwealth or a State, Territory or foreign country, or of part of a State, Territory or foreign country; or (ii) 	intimidating the public or a section of the public. The reference to lawful advocacy, protest or dissent has been removed. Advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action is now excluded from the definition of terrorism so long as it is not intended to, among other things, cause serious physical harm to a person or to create a serious risk to public health or safety. Section 102. 2 of the original bill would also have given the federal attorney general the power to proscribe (or ban) an organisation, followed thereafter by criminal offences, including 25 years jail, for members and supporters of the banned organisation. This power would have enabled the attorney general to ban an organisation for reasons including that the organisation ‘has endangered, or is likely to endanger, the security or integrity of the Commonwealth or another country’. ‘Integrity’ would at least have referred to the geographical, or territorial, integrity of a nation, and hence this power could have been used to proscribe an organisation that advocated or supported non-violent independence movements within other nations. Over recent years, a good example would be organisations supporting independence for East Timor. The power to ban organisations could have been exercised unilaterally by the attorney general and not as part of a fair and accountable process. The attorney general need not have given any reasons for a decision, and any decision would not have been subject to meaningful independent review. It was intended by the government that a decision to proscribe an organisation could be reviewed under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth). But this may not have always been available. The capacity to review a decision under section 102. 2 could have been removed by regulation made under section 19 B of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act (which would be subject to disallowance, but only when Parliament next sat). A judge might in any event have refused to review a decision made under section 102. 2 where the decision related to a matter of national security. Such matters are usually seen by the courts as non-justiciable. Even if a court was prepared to examine a decision, effective review would require that a proscribed organisation could marshal the evidence needed to show that a decision had not been properly made. This would likely require access to sensitive national security information. This hurdle would almost always be insurmountable. Even if a judge were to proceed to review a decision made under section 102. 2, the grounds of review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act are narrow and procedural. There would be no scope for review on broader proportionality grounds. In orders words, it could not be argued that a decision was wrongly made because it was not ‘reasonably appropriate and adapted’ to the relevant purpose or object. This is a serious limitation upon the scope of review under the Act. If a wrongfully proscribed organisation was successful in having a decision under section 102. 2 overturned, the process of review could take a considerable period during which its reputation and standing in the community could be tarnished irrevocably. Retrospective judicial remedies provide an insufficient means of controlling a power like that under section 102. 2. Clearly, the power to proscribe an organisation (and effectively to destroy it by prosecuting any person who continues {{to be associated with the}} organisation) should not be vested solely in a member of the executive. The Terrorism Bill was similar in design to the Communist Party Dissolution Act 1950 (Cth). That Act granted the governor general an unfettered, and unreviewable, power to declare an organisation to be unlawful or a person to be a communist. The act was struck down by the High Court because it granted the governor general an unreviewable and unfettered power. The Terrorism Bill may not have suffered from the same constitutional defect as the Communist Party Dissolution Act because review of a decision of the attorney general would have been available, even if it was ineffective. Despite this, its similarity with the Dissolution Act is of grave concern. Both give a very broad power to a member of the executive to ban an organisation. The separation of powers, including the notion that power must not be concentrated in any one arm of government, suggests that the proscription power should be vested instead in a court, or at least must be subject to a more strict form of scrutiny by an independent tribunal. The dangers of not doing so are obvious. As Sir Owen Dixon stated in the Communist Party Case: History and not only ancient history, shows that in countries where democratic institutions have been unconstitutionally superseded, it has been done not seldom by those holding the executive power. The Terrorism Bill was amended to remove its proscription element. The legislation as enacted does not vest any general power in the attorney general to proscribe organisations and to criminalise their members. Instead, it contains criminal sanctions for involvement with a terrorist organisation, including recruiting members, providing support or funds, directing their activities or being a member. The act defines a terrorist organisation to be ‘an organisation that is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act occurs) ’. Under a very limited form of proscription, an organisation will also be a terrorist organisation where the attorney general is satisfied that the Security Council of the United Nations has made a decision about terrorism identifying the organisation and ‘the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur) ’. DESPITE a victory in achieving significant changes to the Terrorism Bill, the battle over the legislative response to September 11 has not been won. The Senate has yet to deal with the second package of legislation that would confer unprecedented new powers upon ASIO. The ASIO Bill will likely be debated in the next sittings of the federal parliament beginning on 19 August. This will be a more difficult process than the debate over the Terrorism Bill as it may be more of a challenge to engage Australians and the media in debate on anti-terrorism measures a second time. The politics of the bill will also be more difficult. Objections to the Terrorism Bill could be met through careful amendment. By contrast, the flaws in the ASIO Bill are at a more fundamental level and may require outright rejection of the Bill rather than piecemeal change. Although it is not the intention of the government, the ASIO Bill would establish part of the apparatus of a police state. It is a law that would not be out of place in some former dictatorships. The ASIO Bill would allow adults, and even children, to be detained and strip searched, and to be held by ASIO for rolling periods of two days that could be extended indefinitely. While detained, they could be denied access to people outside of ASIO, and could not inform their employer, family members or even a lawyer of their detention. Section 34 F(8) of the bill states: ‘A person who has been taken into custody, or detained, under this Division is not permitted to contact, and may be prevented from contacting, anyone at any time while in custody or detention. ’ ASIO would require a warrant from a ‘prescribed authority’ for the detention of an Australian citizen. However, this need not be obtained from a judge. The bill enables a warrant to be granted by a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), a non-judicial body whose officers are members of the executive. Moreover, members of the AAT, other than presidential members, are appointed for fixed periods and lack entrenched independence or tenure. They are dependent upon the favour of the executive if seek reappointment. The ASIO Bill would authorise the detention of Australians without charges being laid, or even the possibility that they might be laid. Australians could be held by ASIO not because they have engaged in terrorism or are likely to do so, but because they know something about a <b>terrorist</b> <b>offence.</b> They could be held without access to legal advice and without the normal rights to silence and to avoid self-incrimination (a five year jail term applies for refusing to answer a question). While the bill says that detainees ‘must be treated with humanity and with respect for human dignity’, there is no penalty for ASIO officers who subject detainees to cruel, inhumane or degrading punishment. In fact, under section 92 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (Cth) it is an offence to even publish the identity of an ASIO officer. The ASIO Bill is inconsistent with basic democratic and judicial principles. Australians should not be detained except as a result of a finding of guilt by a judge or as part of the judicial process (such as being held in custody pending a bail hearing). Neither parliament nor any part of government should be given the power to detain Australians without a trial except for well known exceptions such as mental illness or infectious disease. This underpins Australia’s democratic system and the separation of powers entrenched by the Australian Constitution. The ASIO Bill breaches basic principles and could be challenged in the High Court. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD reported in May 2002. The committee, including members of the government, found that the legislation ‘would undermine key legal rights and erode the civil liberties that make Australia a leading democracy’. Despite this, the committee made only modest recommendations about the operational aspects of the legislation, including that it not apply to children and that people be detained for a maximum of seven days. The committee failed to address the main issue. That is, a government should not have the power to detain Australian citizens where there is no suspicion that they have committed an offence. It has never been recognised that Australian citizens should be detained incommunicado to help ASIO with its inquiries. Australians should not accept the imprisonment of citizens except as part of a fair and independent judicial process resulting from allegations of criminal conduct. There are grave dangers in allowing a government to bypass the courts, especially where a secret government organisation is involved. It would not be acceptable to the community for a state police force to secretly detain people for lengthy periods, nor should it be for ASIO. Even lesser police powers should not be granted to an organisation except in circumstances where their exercise is subject to a high level of accountability, including public scrutiny. If ASIO is to be granted new police powers it must be subject to the political and community scrutiny and controls that would apply to any other police force. However, this is not compatible with the current intelligence gathering work of ASIO and its organisational structure (such as in regard to the secrecy applying to the identity of its employees). It would be difficult, if not impossible, for ASIO both to be sufficiently secretive to adequately fulfil its primary mission, as well as sufficiently open to scrutiny as would be necessary for it to exercise the powers set out in the ASIO Bill. DESPITE substantial amendment of the Terrorism Bill, it remains likely that Parliament will enact legislation abrogating civil liberties and our democratic principles to a greater extent than any piece of legislation since the anti-communist law of 1950. The powers to be given to ASIO may not be used against the Australian people today, or even over the next decade, but we cannot guess at the wisdom and motives of a government in 10, 20 or even 50 years time. The stakes are high and we are now in the thick of the debate. The following weeks will be crucial. We must deny ASIO the power to detain Australians where there is no suspicion that they have committed a crime. If we do not, a new precedent in law enforcement will have been set, and once that line is crossed there may be no coming back. The {{debate on the}} government’s legal response to September 11 shows how bad laws can emerge from hasty decisions made in times of danger. We must keep this in mind in ensuring that our Parliament does not enact anti-terrorism laws that we are likely to regret for many years to come.
