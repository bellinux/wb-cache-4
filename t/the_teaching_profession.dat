40|$|The {{attitude}} of teachers towards <b>teaching</b> <b>profession</b> {{is as important}} as teaching knowledge. It is estimated that teachers who have positive attitudes towards <b>teaching</b> <b>profession</b> may show humanistic attitudes and behaviors to students. Therefore, this study examines correlation between attitudes towards <b>teaching</b> <b>profession</b> and pupil control ideology of teacher candidates. The participants of the study comprise 281 teacher candidates at Ondokuz Mayıs University’s Faculty of Education. In this study, two instruments were used for data gathering. “Teaching Profession Attitude Scale” was used to evaluate <b>the</b> attitudes towards <b>teaching</b> <b>profession</b> of <b>the</b> teacher candidates. “Pupil Control Ideology Inventory” was used for determining the level of pupil control ideology of teacher candidates on a humanistic-custodial dimension. The results of Pearson moment correlation analysis indicated that the pupil control ideology was negatively correlated with <b>the</b> attitude towards <b>teaching</b> <b>profession</b> of teacher candidates. According to simple regression analysis, <b>the</b> attitude towards <b>teaching</b> <b>profession</b> is a significant predictor for pupil control ideology on teacher candidates T-test analysis indicated that {{there was no significant difference}} according to gender in terms of pupil control ideology and <b>the</b> attitude towards <b>teaching</b> <b>profession</b> of teacher candidates...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{secondary}} <b>teaching</b> <b>profession</b> in Brazil {{is compared}} with <b>the</b> secondary <b>teaching</b> <b>profession</b> in <b>the</b> United States. The role of <b>the</b> secondary <b>teaching</b> <b>profession</b> {{is influenced by}} cultural values and beliefs, {{as well as by}} social and economic conditions. Similarities and differences in the role and preparation of secondary teachers in Brazil and the United States are identified and related to the historical and cultural contexts in which they have developed. The role of <b>the</b> secondary <b>teaching</b> <b>professions</b> in these two cultures is examined through the analysis of two types of data. Historical trends and cultural processes which have influenced the development of <b>the</b> secondary <b>teaching</b> <b>professions</b> are identified through a comparison of information obtained from the education literature. A second body of data consisted of information about professional status and job satisfaction collected through questionnaires distributed to secondary teachers in Petropolis, Rio de Janeiro and Tucson, Arizona. Qualitative as well as quantitative techniques were used to analyze these data, so that cultural values and beliefs could be identified along with statistically significant differences in the teachers' responses. When historical and cultural factors affecting secondary education were examined, five major patterns were identified. These patterns were related {{to the role of the}} Catholic church in education, the social function of education, centralization of the educational system, the social and political organizations shaping secondary education, and funding for education. Questionnaire responses indicated that low pay was the most important factor affecting job satisfaction for both Brazilian and American secondary teachers. There were significant differences, however, in the social rankings of education related professions in the two countries. Brazilian teachers ranked the professions of University professor and elementary teachers significantly lower than did the American teachers. American teachers ranked the profession of school principal significantly lower than did the Brazilian teachers. The two groups of teachers shared similar feelings about the effects of factors such as national politics and parental cooperation on their professions...|$|R

Until local training was completed and there were graduates, some teachers immigrated from eastern Canada and Europe to teach at the early one room school houses. Teachers from the 1880s through to 1940s taught in one room school houses which offered grades 1 through 8, and, where needed, also grades 9 through 12 with classroom sizes varying from 10 through to 40 students.
