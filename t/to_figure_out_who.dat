The girls think Shana was 'A', and with her gone, they no longer worry about 'A'. However, 'A' returns, blowing up the Cavanaugh house and leaving the liars more afraid than ever. With Alison back, Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer notice how their friendship has changed since Ali's disappearance. The other residents in Rosewood also deal with Alison coming home, and it leads to Mona making an army against her, consisting of residents whom Ali bullied back in the day.

25|$|Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial {{candidate}} (and the late Congressman Flood's nephew), Harry F. Byrd supported creation of Shenandoah National Park, as did his friend William E. Carson, a businessman {{who had become}} Virginia's first chairman of the Commission on Conservation and Development. Development of the western national parks had assisted tourism, which produced jobs, which Byrd and local politicians supported. The land that became Shenandoah park was scenic, mountainous, and had also lost about half of its trees to the Chestnut blight (which was incurable and affected trees as they reached maturity). However, it had been held as private property for over a century, so many farms and orchards existed. After Byrd became governor and convinced the legislature to appropriate $1 million for land acquisition and other work, Carson and his teams (including surveyors and his brother Kit who was Byrd's law partner) tried <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> owned the land. They found that it consisted of more than 5,000 parcels, some of them inhabited by tenant farmers or squatters (who were ineligible to receive compensation). Some landowners, including wealthy resort owner George Freeman Pollock and Luray realtor and developer L. Ferdinand Zerkel, had long wanted the park created and had formed the Northern Virginia Park Association {{to win over the}} national park selection committee. However, many local families who had lived in the area for generations (especially people over 60 years old) did not want to sell their land, and some refused to sell at any price. Carson promised that if they sold to the state, they could still live on their homesteads {{for the rest of their}} lives. Carson also lobbied the new President Herbert Hoover, who bought land to establish a vacation fishing camp near the headwaters of the Rapidan River (and would ultimately donate it to the park as he left office; it remains as Rapidan Camp).|$|E

Those outfits achieve exactly what I was trying to achieve. There's flamboyance, there's real risk-taking, but when I walk into the room, it's not flashy. It's actually very subtle.

[...] Leight told TV Guide about Baldwin's Captain Harris character, [...] "He comes into situations that are all screwed up, and his job is <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who's</b> straight, who's corrupt, who can he trust to restore order.

Commenting that the album garnered its title from her personality, Tisdale said she wanted to use her first album to formally introduce herself personally, and as not one of the characters she portrays.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the script at the time Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He replied: I think {{that might be the}} original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft [...] maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in trying <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> would do something like this, {{the only way to make}} sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. [...] When Ryan Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. A fan of his work, the actor chose the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. [...] "It had to be [...] There was no other choice." ...|$|E
500|$|After seven episodes, Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku {{disliked the}} series {{so much that}} he {{discouraged}} viewers from watching it for that particular season. He supported this by stating that the premise of teenagers summoning monsters has been done to death and that the adaptation has no compelling mysteries nor are there deeper psychological dilemmas being explored. Eisenbeis shared sentiments with the Anime News Network reviewers when he elaborated on what he called the [...] "woefully underdeveloped" [...] characters of Devil Survivor 2 who are only given rudimentary back-stories. This had the added effect of making it nearly impossible <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> exactly is a one-off character and who is a main character since they are all equally subjected to the threat of death. Eisenbeis noted that this made their demise genuinely shocking as it added to the viewing tension. Eisenbeis went on to write that the other characters were contrast to the main villain (or antihero) Yamato Hotsuin since he gets so much development that much of the series' runtime is spent on his backstory and goals than all the other characters combined. This helps give an in-depth understanding of the character and simultaneously made him an excellent villain.|$|E
5000|$|The Plain Dealers Troy L. Smith {{wrote that}} the album [...] "plays it safe and smart", {{explaining}} it [...] "functions as 'My Everything 2.0' - a collection of pitch-perfect hooks and slick production built in the mold of Mariah Carey."

[...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that Grande [...] "too often tries to look and sound more mature than she is,"observing that [...] "the songs on the album's latter half are limited by their strict adherence to contemporary pop and R&B trends." [...] In a mixed review, Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone opined that [...] "as an album artist, she's prone to a schizophrenic sound and unfortunate sequencing," [...] adding that [...] "we're still no closer <b>to</b> <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> she wants <b>to</b> be."

5000|$|Klein is {{a regular}} blogger on time.coms Swampland blog. In November 2007, Salon {{columnist}} Glenn Greenwald wrote about what he alleged were factual errors in a Klein story about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

[...] Time later published a comment: [...] "In the original version of this story, Joe Klein wrote that the House Democratic version of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) would allow a court review of individual foreign surveillance targets. Republicans believe the bill can be interpreted that way, but Democrats dont." [...] Greenwald noted that the text of the legislation does not require court review of individual targets, and that Times response disregards this fact.

500|$|In April 2016, the ABC-owned {{cable network}} Freeform {{announced}} Marvel's Cloak & Dagger, {{based on the}} characters of the same name, with a straight-to-series order for 2018. The network confirmed that the series would be [...] "its first venture into the Marvel Cinematic Universe", and described the show as a [...] "superhero love story", a premise that Variety called [...] "a seamless fit for Freeform" [...] given the network's target audience of [...] "Becomers" [...] (the 14-34 age demographic). This younger-skewing content was continued with the comedy series Marvel's New Warriors ordered in April 2017, with Freeform executive Karey Burke saying, Marvel [...] "started to see our strength with young adults and together we could create a pipeline for content that was specific to our audience that felt younger than what they're doing at the other channels... It was important {{to both of us}} to find the right characters that felt like they would speak directly to Freeform's audience. The Avengers wouldn't work here but the about-to-be-Avengers works here." [...] Loeb noted that it was [...] "exciting" [...] to Marvel [...] "to be able to explore the world of the hero and how it affects someone who is trying <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> they are as opposed to already knows who they are and now their whole life has to take a left.

500|$|Erica Hahn was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't really {{think it was going}} to work out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too– kind of like when I used to be single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has said that she was not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I {{have no idea what it}} really is to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am really good at it. I have to look like I’ve been doing it a long time".|$|E

50|$|Other {{legal experts}} {{point to the}} fact that the current U.S. {{government}} did not exist prior to June 21, 1788 when the United States Constitution was ratified. Therefore, they say the U.S. government inherited the institution of slavery, and cannot be held legally liable for the enslavement of Africans by Europeans prior <b>to</b> that time. <b>Figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> was enslaved by whom in order to fairly apply reparations from the U.S. government only to those who were enslaved under U.S. laws, would be an impossible task.|$|R
5000|$|Acid Brass was {{released}} to generally favourable reviews. Steve Huey of Allmusic was mixed in his assessment, who said [...] "the somewhat dodgy (and condescending) concept for this record, by artist Jeremy Deller, {{is that both}} brass bands and raves are staples of British working-class life, so a fusion of the two styles of music is natural. While the results are certainly well played, it's extremely difficult <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> exactly <b>who</b> Acid Brass is supposed to appeal to, except maybe the kitsch audience." [...] Joshua Klein of The A.V. Club was favourable, saying: [...] "If the musicians weren't so serious about the endeavor, it wouldn't quite work, and as it stands, A Guy Called Gerald's 'Voodoo Ray' sounds pretty silly when played by a marching band. But the arrangements retain much of the simple hookiness of the originals." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{title and}} {{plot of the}} episode {{reference}} the 2006 film The Departed and the episode contains several elements of the film, {{including the use of}} the Dropkick Murphys song [...] "I'm Shipping Up to Boston", Donny's attire being similar to what Leonardo DiCaprio wears for parts of the film, Bart suspecting he is being sabotaged just as Jack Nicholson's character began to suspect he had a mole in his criminal crew, a minor event in the story leading <b>to</b> someone <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> is betraying them, and Principal Skinner employing Donny in Bart's crew just as Martin Sheen's character does with DiCaprio's character. The scene where Bart is chasing Donny through the school and the playground was an exact replica of the scene in the film where DiCaprio chases Matt Damon through the city streets. The episode also ends with the appearance of a rat, just like the film does.|$|R

2500|$|For Murray, in {{addition}} to their shared abandonment issues, Lucas's love for literature also appealed to him. Murray had become a fan of the genre during high school, and felt it changed his way of seeing things; it made him rethink his own actions. Lucas has been described as [...] "caught between being charming and a nerd, a hermit and confident". Murray said of the character, [...] "He's very introverted." [...] He described Lucas as an observer, someone who likes to watch people and try <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> they really are, as opposed to who they think they are, another aspect similar to Murray's own personality.|$|E
