5|$|His tasks {{included}} finding {{experts to}} examine and report on his collections from the voyage. Darwin proposed to edit these reports, writing his own forewords and notes, and used his contacts to lobby for government sponsorship of publication of these findings as a large book. When a Treasury grant of £1,000 was allocated {{at the end of}} August 1837, Darwin stretched the project to include the geology book that he had conceived in April 1832 at the first landfall in the voyage. He selected Smith, Elder & Co. as <b>the</b> <b>publisher,</b> and gave them unrealistic commitments on the timing of providing the text and illustrations. He assured the Treasury that the work would be good value, as <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> would only require a small commission profit, and he himself would have no profit. From October he planned what became the multi-volume Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle on his collections, and began writing about the geology of volcanic islands.|$|E
