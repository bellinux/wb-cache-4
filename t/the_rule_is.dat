5|$|The {{authenticity}} of the Libellus (notwithstanding Boniface's suspicions, on which see below) was not called into serious question until the mid-twentieth century, when several historians forwarded {{the hypothesis that the}} document had been concocted in England in the early eighth century. It has since been shown, however, that this hypothesis was based on incomplete evidence and historical misapprehensions. In particular, twentieth-century scholarship focused on the presence in the Libellus of what appeared to be an impossibly lax rule regarding consanguinity and marriage, a rule that (it was thought) Gregory could not possibly have endorsed. It is now known that this rule is not in fact as lax as historians had thought, and moreover that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> fully consistent with Gregory's style and mode of thought. Today, Gregory I's authorship of the Libellus is generally accepted. The question of authenticity aside, manuscript and textual evidence indicates that the document was being transmitted in Italy by perhaps as early as the beginning of the seventh century (i.e. shortly after Gregory I's death in 604), and in England {{by the end of the}} same century.|$|E
25|$|Saint Thomas Christians do {{not marry}} close relatives. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> that {{the bride and}} groom must not be related for at least five generations.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> {{not hard}} and fast, with counter-examples such as vinr, {{which has the}} synonym vin, yet retains the unabsorbed version, and jǫtunn, where {{assimilation}} takes place even though the root vowel, ǫ, is short.|$|E

50|$|The {{respondents}} defended {{their actions}} {{by arguing that}} <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR). Namely, that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> required to maintain an acceptable standard for firefighting.|$|R
50|$|Creator {{is based}} on the idea of {{independent}} characters that have a graphical appearance and non-graphical properties. Each character has a list of rules that determine how it behaves. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> created by demonstrating what the character does in a specific situation. Each <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> a before / after rule, stating that when the before conditions of <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>are</b> met, <b>the</b> after actions of <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>are</b> performed.|$|R
25|$|In general, {{the rule}} {{applies only to}} conduct leading {{directly}} to a final decision, and not to an investigation meant for obtaining information. In Subbiah Pillai v. Wong Meng Meng (2001), the Court of Appeal held {{that there was no}} right for the solicitor in question to be present every time the Inquiry Committee of the Law Society of Singapore, which had been convened to look into a complaint against him, spoke to a witness. This was because the work of the Inquiry Committee was investigative rather than prosecutorial in nature. Even though <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> of paramount importance, its application is not universal. The exact ambit of <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> said to be unclear.|$|E
25|$|Lower value notes (10 ~ 500 tögrög) {{issued in}} 2000 and after have line-patterned color underprint {{on the entire}} note, where the {{previous}} edition had near-white solid color. But one exception to <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> the 2000 edition of 500 tögrög.|$|E
25|$|In claims {{concerning}} {{discrimination on}} religious grounds, {{the burden of}} proof shifts to the employer, landlord or service provider who has to prove the two elements: (1) that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> necessary and (2) he accommodates the individual to the point of undue hardship.|$|E
30|$|Once <b>the</b> first <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> {{sent over}} <b>the</b> UART, <b>the</b> second <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> sent {{followed}} by <b>the</b> third <b>rule.</b> This sequence <b>was</b> followed till <b>the</b> final <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> sent.|$|R
50|$|In rules-based SDC, a rigid set of <b>rules</b> <b>is</b> used to {{determine}} whether or not the results of data analysis can <b>be</b> released. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> applied consistently, which makes it obvious what kinds of output are acceptable. However, because <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> inflexible, either disclosive information may still slip through, or <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> overrestrictive and may only allow for results that are too broad for useful analysis to be published.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> {{applied to}} a control chart on which the {{magnitude}} of some variable is plotted against time. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> based on <b>the</b> mean value and the standard deviation of the samples.|$|R
25|$|In May 1892 Scottish Mountaineer William W. Naismith devised Naismith's rule {{while walking}} over Cruach Ardrain {{on the way}} to the {{neighbouring}} mountain of Ben More. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> a simple formula for estimating walking time taking into account not just distance but also height to be ascended.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} {{limitations}} {{to the rule}} of necessity. One suggested limitation is that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> inapplicable if the disqualification of a member will still leave a quorum of an administrative agency capable of acting. Another is that the rule of necessity will not justify an adjudicator sitting where actual bias can be shown.|$|E
25|$|A rule of {{inference}} states that, given {{a particular}} formula (or set of formulas) {{with a certain}} property as a hypothesis, another specific formula (or set of formulas) can be derived as a conclusion. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> sound (or truth-preserving) if it preserves validity {{in the sense that}} whenever any interpretation satisfies the hypothesis, that interpretation also satisfies the conclusion.|$|E
5000|$|According to the National Catholic Reporter Corsetti's lawyer said:“The {{president}} of the United States doesn’t know what <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are.</b> <b>The</b> secretary of defense doesn’t know what <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are.</b> But <b>the</b> government expects this Pfc. to know what <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> are?” ...|$|R

25|$|The {{distinction}} between leftmost derivation and rightmost derivation {{is important because}} in most parsers {{the transformation of the}} input is defined by giving a piece of code for every grammar rule that is executed whenever <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> applied. Therefore, {{it is important to know}} whether the parser determines a leftmost or a rightmost derivation because this determines the order in which the pieces of code will be executed. See for an example LL parsers and LR parsers.|$|E
25|$|As a {{condition}} of employment, workers {{may be required to}} answer their employer's narrowly defined questions regarding conduct on the job. If an employee invokes the Garrity rule (sometimes called the Garrity Warning or Garrity Rights) before answering the questions, then the answers cannot be used in criminal prosecution of the employee. This principle was developed in Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493 (1967). <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> most commonly applied to public employees such as police officers.|$|E

25|$|Sandra Wilde in 1990 {{claimed the}} sounded-like-E version of <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> {{one of only}} two sound–letter {{correspondence}} rules worth teaching in elementary schools. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> covered by five of nine software programs for spelling education studied by Barbara Mullock in 2012.|$|R
25|$|Major pre-independence {{stations}} including Kuala Lumpur station, Klang station, Port Klang {{station and}} Seremban station were retained and upgraded to support Komuter services. Smaller, wood-based stations and halts {{along the line}} that were built at {{around the same time}} were either demolished and replaced by modern brick-and-concrete counterparts, or simply abandoned. The only exception to <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> the old Sentul station, which has remained in service years since KTM Komuter's launch, albeit with a replacement platform.|$|E
25|$|The main duty of a heraldic {{device is}} to be recognized, and the dark colours or light metals are {{supposed}} to be too difficult to distinguish if they are placed on top of other dark or light colours, particularly in poor light. Though this is the practical genesis of the rule, <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> technical and appearance is not used in determining whether arms conform to the rule. Another reason sometimes given to justify this rule is that it was difficult to paint with enamel (colour) over enamel, or with metal over metal.|$|E
25|$|With -our {{words like}} colour/color or behaviour/behavior the {{spelling}} of -our is always used unless a Trademark, such as Colorsteel or The Color Run, etc. Foreign official awards {{such as the}} FBI Medal Of Valor always retain their US spelling in New Zealand texts. Additionally the online version of The New Zealand Herald newspaper republishes articles with US spelling when the original article is written with US spelling, such as articles from the Associated Press. Since the advent of Word Processors with spell-checkers, in modern assignment writing in New Zealand universities <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> to use either 100% British spelling or 100% American spelling the emphasis being consistency.|$|E

50|$|Horse {{fighting}} was practised for sport, although <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> unclear. It {{appears to have}} involved two stallions pitted against each other, within smell and sight of fenced-off mares. Whatever <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were,</b> <b>the</b> fights often resulted {{in the death of}} one of the stallions.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> here {{explained}} in simple terms. As will follow from a later section, if the mathematical concept of vectors is known, some of <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> may <b>be</b> stated more briefly. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> may also <b>be</b> stated {{in terms of}} the physical concepts velocity and acceleration.|$|R
25|$|High full pitched balls {{that pass}} or would have {{passed on the}} full above waist height of the striker are deemed dangerously unfair, except for slow deliveries, where <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> above {{shoulder}} height. The same sanctions apply to high full pitched balls as apply to fast short pitched balls. Such deliveries, which are called beamers, can be incredibly dangerous. Usually they only occur by mistake, when a ball slips in the bowler's hand {{at the point of}} delivery and bowlers usually immediately apologise to the batsman for their mistake. If they are bowled deliberately, no ball is immediately called, the bowler is removed and is reported to the authority to which he is responsible for further disciplinary action.|$|E
25|$|A way {{for making}} {{formulae}} referring to different worlds not interacting {{in the wrong}} way {{is to make sure}} that all formulae of a branch refer to the same world. This condition is initially true as all formulae in the set to be checked for consistency are assumed referring to the same world. When expanding a branch, two situations are possible: either the new formulae refer to the same world as the other one in the branch or not. In the first case, <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> applied normally. In the second case, all formulae of the branch that do not also hold in the new world are deleted from the branch, and possibly added to all other branches that are still relative to the old world.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} (3×3×3) Rubik's Cube {{has eight}} corners and twelve edges. There are 8! (40,320) ways {{to arrange the}} corner cubes. Each corner has three possible orientations, although only seven (of eight) can be oriented independently; {{the orientation of the}} eighth (final) corner depends on the preceding seven, giving 37 (2,187) possibilities. There are 12!/2 (239,500,800) ways to arrange the edges, restricted from 12! because edges must be in an even permutation exactly when the corners are. (When arrangements of centres are also permitted, as described below, <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> that the combined arrangement of corners, edges, and centres must be an even permutation.) Eleven edges can be flipped independently, with the flip of the twelfth depending on the preceding ones, giving 211 (2,048) possibilities.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> {{written for}} {{individually}} based figures and {{this approach was}} {{in marked contrast to}} the element based rulesets current amongst ancient historical wargames when <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> first published.
