25|$|In 1980 Brian De Palma, who {{directed}} Carrie, wanted Liv Ullmann {{to play the}} role of Kate Miller in the erotic crime thriller Dressed to Kill and offered it to her, but she declined because of the violence. The role subsequently went to Angie Dickinson. In 1982 Ingmar Bergman wanted Ullmann to play the main character Emelie Ekdahl in his last feature film, Fanny and Alexander and wrote the role with this in mind. But Ullmann felt the role was too sad and declined. Liv Ullmann later stated in interviews that turning it down was one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> she really regrets.|$|E
25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> {{that both}} the Greco-Roman and the vernacular Irish sources agree on about the druids is that they played an {{important}} part in pagan Celtic society. In his description, Julius Caesar claimed that they were one of the two most important social groups in the region (alongside the equites, or nobles) and were responsible for organizing worship and sacrifices, divination, and judicial procedure in Gaulish, British and Irish society. He also claimed that they were exempt from military service and from the payment of taxes, and had the power to excommunicate people from religious festivals, making them social outcasts. Two other classical writers, Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, also wrote about the role of druids in Gallic society, claiming that the druids were held in such respect that if they intervened between two armies they could stop the battle.|$|E
25|$|Once La Rue {{was engaged}} with the Grande chapelle, he made two trips to Spain. On the second trip, in 1506, he was shipwrecked in the English Channel, and spent three {{months at the}} court of Henry VII of England. After two more years in Spain, {{in the service of}} Juana of Castile – Joanna the Mad – he {{returned}} to the Netherlands in 1508, probably because Juana had been forced out of power (her husband, Philip, had died of typhus in 1506). Juana was inconsolable, unable to leave the corpse of her dead husband, and had become quite insane; why La Rue stayed as long as he did is not known, but it is not impossible that his dark, intensely expressive music was one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> that brought her solace. In addition, he was treated well. Juana promoted him to premier chapelain, the head of the chapel, and paid him twice what the other singers received; paying the singers was apparently the one of the only practical administrative matters she was able to do during the period of her madness.|$|E

500|$|The name [...] "Robinsons" [...] {{has also}} been {{used to refer to}} those Jews who hid out in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto in the {{aftermath}} of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Uri Orlev's (Jerzy Orlowski) children's book The Island on Bird Street (1981), adapted into a 1997 film, tells the story of an 11-year-old boy who hides out in the ruins of the ghetto. Orlev also draws analogies with Robinson Crusoe in this work; in fact one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> Alex, the story's protagonist, possesses is a copy of Defoe's novel.|$|E
500|$|During the two Zaca expeditions Beebe was {{accompanied}} by his longtime assistant John Tee-Van as well as Jocelyn Crane, a young carcinologist who had first worked for Beebe at Nonsuch Island in 1932, and who would subsequently be among Beebe's most cherished associates {{for the rest of}} his life. Like Hollister before her, Crane would eventually become Beebe's lover during the long expeditions that Beebe made without Elswyth's companionship. During this time Beebe was also forming a close friendship with Winnie-the-Pooh's creator A. A. Milne, who wrote of Half Mile Down [...] "I don't know which I envy you most: all those moral and physical qualities which you have and I lack, or all that wonder of a new world. [...] One of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> in the world of which I am really proud is that I know Will Beebe." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} room is {{the large}} Marble Hall (1) at {{the centre of the}} south front; this hall {{is the beginning of a}} grand procession of rooms, and corresponds to the former Great Parlour or Saloon (9) on the north front. The Marble Hall is flanked by the former Little Parlour (11, now the Tapestry Room) and the Great Staircase (2), while the Saloon is flanked by two withdrawing rooms (8, 10). The bedrooms are arranged in individual suites on both floors of the two wings (3, etc.) that flank the state centre of the house. The main staircase, set to one side of the Marble Hall, is one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> at Belton which is asymmetrically placed. It has a robust plaster-work ceiling incorporating the Brownlow crest by the London plasterer Edward Goudge, [...] "now looked on as ye best master in England in his profession," [...] William Winde reported in 1690.|$|E

500|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> {{retained}} {{from earlier}} ships was {{the position of}} the tripod foremast with its spotting top behind the forward funnel to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the boat-handling derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable at times, but the Board of Admiralty insisted on it for all the ships of the 1909–1910 Programme. David K. Brown, naval architect and historian, commented on the whole fiasco: [...] "It is amazing that it took so long to attain a satisfactory arrangement, which was caused by the Director of Naval Ordnance (DNO)'s insistence on sighting hoods in the roofs of turrets and Jellicoe's obsession with boat-handling arrangements. These unsatisfactory layouts reduced firepower, prejudiced torpedo protection and probably added to cost. As DNO and then as Controller, Jellicoe must accept much of the blame for the unsatisfactory layout of the earlier ships." ...|$|E

[...] It said that there had been an overall improvement in the fourth season, and that [...] "this could become some of the best Star Trek ever made". It gave [...] "Kir'Shara" [...] a rating of four and a half out of five. In Matthew Kappell's book Star Trek As Myth, he said that he felt that the revelation that the previous Vulcan administration was working with the Romulans all along [...] "suddenly makes sense of years of previously incomprehensible Vulcan policy" [...] and linked to The Next Generation episode [...] "".|$|E
500|$|John Jude Palencar {{illustrated}} the English cover featuring the golden dragon Glaedr. The {{content of the}} cover was one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> initially confirmed by Paolini before he wrote the book. He had originally planned for it to feature a green dragon, but later indicated that this was affected by {{the expansion of the}} series to a four-book cycle. Paolini liked the cover because it reflects that Brisingr is the longest and [...] "most intense entry in the series so far." [...] The Japanese translation of Brisingr was so large that the publisher split it into two volumes. Since the Japanese did not want the same cover on two volumes, they commissioned Palencar to paint one of the Lethrblaka for the second volume. The Lethrblaka are the Ra'zac's steeds and parents. Paolini made drawings based on the book for the deluxe edition of Brisingr, including one with Eragon's arm and hand holding the sword he receives in the book. The sword, named Brisingr, has flames around its blade.|$|E

With all of his recent acclaim he finally decided {{he might be able to}} make a living as a photographer, and with little notice he quit his job and launched into being a professional photographer. He wrote to his friend F.

2500|$|Soon {{after taking}} over, United laid off all but nine of WMUR's {{employees}} and reduced local programming to its two daily newscasts.

[...] It paid almost {{no attention to the}} station even as equipment broke down. [...] The studio's upkeep also suffered; the floor was so slanted that cameras rolled on their own. [...] WMUR continued to broadcast in black-and-white up until 1973, long after the Boston stations all upgraded to color capability. [...] Two of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> the station had going for it during this time were The Uncle Gus Show, hosted by Gus Bernier for more than 20 years, and an increasingly active news department led by Tom Bonnar and Fred Kocher.|$|E

2500|$|Little {{is known}} of Richardson's early years beyond <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> that Richardson was willing to share. Although he was not {{forthcoming}} with specific events and incidents, he did talk {{about the origins of}} his writing ability; Richardson would tell stories to his friends and spent his youth constantly writing letters. One such letter, written when Richardson was almost 11, was directed to a woman in her 50s who was in the habit of constantly criticizing others. [...] "Assuming the style and address of a person in years", Richardson cautioned her about her actions. However, his handwriting was used to determine that it was his work, and the woman complained to his mother. The result was, as he explains, that [...] "my mother chid me for the freedom taken by such a boy with a woman of her years" [...] but also [...] "commended my principles, though she censured the liberty taken".|$|E
2500|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> that {{is known}} of Fuzûlî's life during this time is how he arrived at his pen name. In the {{introduction}} to his collected Persian poems, he says: [...] "In the early days when I {{was just beginning to}} write poetry, every few days I would set my heart on a particular pen name and then after a time change it for another because someone showed up who shared the same name". Eventually, he decided upon the Arabic word fuzûlî—which literally means [...] "impertinent, improper, unnecessary"—because he [...] "knew that this title would not be acceptable to anyone else". Despite the name's pejorative meaning, however, it contains a double meaning—what is called tevriyye (توريه) in Ottoman Divan poetry—as Fuzûlî himself explains: [...] "I was possessed of all the arts and sciences and found a pen name that also implies this sense since in the dictionary fuzûl (ﻓﻀﻮل) is given as a plural of fazl (ﻓﻀﻞ; 'learning') and has the same rhythm as ‘ulûm (ﻋﻠﻮم; 'sciences') and fünûn (ﻓﻨﻮن; 'arts')".|$|E
