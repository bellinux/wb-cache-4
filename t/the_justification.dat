40|$|Abstract. Finding <b>the</b> <b>justifications</b> of an {{entailment}} (that is, all {{the minimal}} set of axioms sufficient {{to produce an}} entailment) {{has emerged as a}} key inference service for the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Justifications are essential for debugging unsatisfiable classes and contradictions. <b>The</b> availability of <b>justifications</b> as explanations of entailments improves the understandability of large and complex ontologies. In this paper, we present several algorithms for computing all <b>the</b> <b>justifications</b> of an entailment in an OWL-DL Ontology and show, by an empirical evaluation, that even a reasoner independent approach works well on real ontologies...|$|R
5|$|Those ransomed were valued on {{a sliding}} scale, ranging from around 1,875DM for a manual worker to around 11,250DM for a doctor. <b>The</b> <b>justification,</b> {{according}} to East Germany, {{was that this}} was compensation for the money invested by the state in the prisoner's training. For a while, payments were made in kind using goods that were in short supply in East Germany, such as oranges, bananas, coffee and medical drugs. The average prisoner was worth around 4,000DM worth of goods.|$|E
5|$|While {{the attacks}} on the Mariana Islands did not seriously disrupt the USAAF air campaign, they had an effect on other American operations. After {{determining}} that the Japanese raiders were staging through Iwo Jima, American forces stepped up their attacks on that island. While the decision to invade Iwo Jima had been made before the raids commenced, stopping the attacks formed part of <b>the</b> <b>justification</b> for the landing. In addition, further air defense units were deployed to the Mariana Islands to protect the B-29 bases.|$|E
5|$|A similar tale {{of divine}} {{seduction}} appears in Greek mythology, where Zeus, a king-of-the-gods figure akin to Indra, seduces Alcmene by assuming {{the form of}} her husband, resulting in {{the birth of the}} legendary hero Heracles. Like Ahalya, Alcmene falls victim to Zeus's trickery in some versions or, recognising his true identity, proceeds with the affair in others. The main difference between the tales is that the raison-d'être of Alcmene's seduction is <b>the</b> <b>justification</b> of Heracles's divine parentage, so she is never condemned as an adulteress or punished; in contrast, Ahalya faces the ire of the scriptures as her encounter is regarded as purely erotic (not resulting in procreation).|$|E

5|$|As of 2016, the {{black-necked grebe}} is {{classified}} as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The trend {{of the population is}} uncertain, as some populations are decreasing, whereas others are stable, have an uncertain trend, or are increasing. <b>The</b> <b>justification</b> for the current classification of this species is its very large population (estimated around 3.9–4.2 million individuals) combined with a large estimated extent of occurrence (about 155 million km2 (60 million sq mi)). This grebe is probably the most numerous grebe in the world.|$|E
5|$|What {{is today}} Route31 was {{defined in the}} 1927 New Jersey state highway {{renumbering}} as Route30, a highway that began in Trenton and ended in Buttzville. In the 1953 renumbering, Route30 was renumbered as Route69, as the number conflicted with US30 in southern New Jersey. The bypass of Ringoes, shared with US202, opened in the1960s. Due to the sexual meaning of the number and resulting sign theft, Route69 was changed in1967 to Route31 once all the signs were removed. <b>The</b> <b>justification</b> for the removal was that people were stealing signs as a trophy for dorm rooms because of their interest in the number69.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 the {{evolutionary}} biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared Paley to Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss, {{the man who}} could argue any case (however hopeless). Gould is struck that Paley can claim that even the agonising pain of gallstones or gout could indicate the goodness of a loving God, with <b>the</b> <b>justification</b> that it felt so good when the pain stopped. Gould makes it clear he finds Paley's argument incorrect scientifically, but states that he respects it as a coherent and well-defended philosophy. Gould particularly respects Paley's method of identifying alternative possibilities and then systematically refuting them. Gould notes that Paley envisages a Lamarckist kind of evolution and rebuts it with the observation that men have not lost their nipples through disuse. However, Gould writes, Paley did not manage to think of one more alternative, natural selection, which has no purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} {{of this analysis}} are to: articulate clearly the central premises {{of each of the}} theories of punishment (retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation) and, to explore the policy implications that flow from each of <b>the</b> <b>justifications.</b> <b>The</b> differences among <b>the</b> theoretical <b>justifications</b> of punishment range from obvious to extremely subtle. This analysis clearly delineates the differing premises of the theories that underlie criminal justice. Attention then turns to the policies that would be pursued if any one of <b>the</b> <b>justifications</b> of punishment were used as the primary basis of the criminal justice system. The major conclusion is that the poli cies derived from the competing theories lead in divergent and often contradictory directions. Finally, bureaucratic accommodations such as plea bargaining are explored in terms of their relationship to the theories of punishment. It is contended that plea bargaining and failure to prosecute multiple charges tend to run counter to all of <b>the</b> <b>justifications</b> of <b>the</b> criminal sanction. The failure to address the policies of criminal justice with reference to the theories of punishment means that the system will have great difficulty achieving any particular goals...|$|R

40|$|David Boonin has {{recently}} advanced several challenges to <b>the</b> self-defense <b>justification</b> of punishment. Boonin argues that <b>the</b> self-defense <b>justification</b> of punishment justifies punishing the innocent, justifies disproportionate punishment, cannot account for mitigating excuses, {{and does not}} justify intentionally harming offenders as we do when we punish them. In this paper, I argue that <b>the</b> self-defense <b>justification,</b> suitably understood, can avoid all of these problems. To help demonstrate the self-defense theory’s attraction, I also develop some contrasts between <b>the</b> self-defense <b>justification,</b> Warren Quinn’s better known ‘auto-retaliator’ argument, and desert-based justifications of punishment. In sum, I show that <b>the</b> self-defense <b>justification</b> of punishment is more resilient than commonly supposed and deserves {{to be taken seriously}} as a justification of punishment...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>justification</b> for {{the closure}} of Loring was that the Air Force had six more {{strategic}} bases than were needed to support the number of bomber and tanker aircraft in the Defense Department's Structure Plan. The base was evaluated against eight selection criteria {{and a large number}} of subelements specific to Air Force bases and missions. Even though Loring was in good condition and had strong community support, it ranked low in the criteria when compared to twenty other bases in the strategic category. One of the things that hurt Loring was its limited peacetime value as a tanker base, as well as its distance from bombing ranges. The commission did note that the facilities at Loring were above average, and the cost to close Loring would be low, the latter of which contributed to its closure.|$|E
5|$|The {{views of}} historians {{of the outcome}} of the battle changed {{with the passage of time}} and the {{changing}} political situations surrounding them. Kutuzov proclaimed a victory both to the army and to Emperor Alexander. While many a general throughout history claimed victory out of defeat (Ramses II of Egypt did so) and in this case, Kutuzov was the one man to whom the entire Russian Army could give its allegiance, but it was an army that, despite the huge losses, considered itself undefeated. Announcing a defeat would have removed Kutuzov from his command, and further damaged an army that had endured much and still stood proud. While Alexander was not deceived by the announcement, it gave him <b>the</b> <b>justification</b> needed to allow Kutuzov to march his army off to rebuild the Russian forces and later complete the near utter destruction of the French army. As such, what was said by Kutuzov and those supporting his views was allowed to pass into the histories of the time unchecked.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{attempts}} {{to shed light}} on why aggressive ideas gain support within established western states. To do that it {{attempts to}} answer the question why the armed conflict against Iraq received such varied support during the first four months of 2003 within the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, France and Spain. A comparative study indicates that <b>the</b> <b>justifications</b> for <b>the</b> armed conflict must be endorsed in the national identities of the particular states. If not, either <b>the</b> <b>justifications</b> or national identities have to be modified. The dominant elite emerge as essential to this process, as does the public experience of vulnerability. It appears that the war against Iraq received such varied support because the initial definitions of national identities endorsed <b>the</b> <b>justifications</b> for <b>the</b> war to different degrees, the dominant elites promoted different opinions and the people experienced different degrees of vulnerability...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the phenomenon of unpaid internships and whether <b>the</b> <b>justifications</b> offered are legitimate. This research was designed to examine: the key debates which surround unpaid internships, <b>the</b> supporting <b>justifications,</b> whether <b>the</b> <b>justifications</b> are legitimate and how the use of unpaid internship is affecting those preparing to enter the industry. This study used two research methods: Content Analysis and Questionnaires. The Content Analysis was used to examine documents (n= 12) such as blogs and articles which supported the use of unpaid internships. The questionnaires were carried out with Public Relations students (n= 14) and Public Relations Practitioners (n= 15). The research then used an adapted form of Boulding’s theory of Legitimacy to investigate legitimating factors. The study has found that <b>the</b> <b>justifications</b> which focused on the intern’s experience were strongly supported and that these justifications were legitimized by that fact that they provide positive payoffs for the student. The research also allowed additional justifications to be revealed. The recommendations constructed from the research note that the internship practice needs to be closely monitored and stronger guidelines should be enforced by the government and the industry bodies...|$|R
