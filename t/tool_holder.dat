40|$|Tool path {{generation}} {{is the key}} procedure to fabricate multi-material (MM) assemblies in rapid prototyping (RP) machines. In slicing MM assembly, there will be 2 D regions of different materials. The regions need to be filled into 2. 5 D slabs. In order to complete all regions in a certain slice faster, <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> should fill the regions simultaneously. In other words, the <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> will move around in the RP work envelope concurrently. In such case, Interference between <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> may occur. Therefore, collision-free path plan should be generated. In this paper, a dexel based spatio-temporal modelling approach is proposed for detecting collision in rapid manufacturing MM assemblies. The approach is based on 2 D regions in dexel representation, which needs only simple computation. As a result, <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> can fill MM regions simultaneously and efficiently.

50|$|A {{spade drill}} bit for metal is a two part bit with a <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> and an {{insertable}} tip, called an insert. The inserts come in various sizes {{that range from}} 7/16 to 2.5 in. The <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> usually has a coolant passage running through it. They are capable of cutting {{to a depth of}} about 10 times the bit diameter. This type of drill bit {{can also be used to}} make stepped holes.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of tipped tools {{is only a}} small insert of the cutting material is needed to provide the cutting ability. The small size makes manufacturing of the insert easier than making a solid tool of the same material. This also reduces cost because the <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> can be made of a less-expensive and tougher material. In some situations a tipped tool is better than its solid counterpart because it combines the toughness of the <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> with the hardness of the insert.|$|E

40|$|The surface {{finishing}} technique called black oxidation {{is currently being}} used on the <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> made of low alloyed tool steel produced by Sandvik Coromant. Black oxidation isn’t considered a sufficient technique because it doesn’t make the <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> look like the quality products that they actually are. The reasoning behind {{this is that the}} <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> can show signs of corrosion after prolonged storing times or in countries with high humidity and temperature. The corrosion doesn’t decrease the <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> performance, but the customers might believe otherwise. After the black oxidation is performed the surface is oiled which can cause sticky surfaces that rubs off on the person handling the <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> which is also {{something that needs to be}} avoided. The aim of this master thesis was to study potential substitutes to the current {{surface finishing}} technique, which could primarily improve the <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> corrosion resistance and appearance. Other material properties have been studied as well such as hardness, friction coefficient, fatigue- and wear resistance. The cost of some of the different surface finishing techniques has been studied as well, because in order to be interesting their price must match what improvements the technique provides with. A preliminary study was done where the surface finishing techniques that are available in the market has been examined. This has been a theoretical study which means that no experiments were performed and that most of the information available in this study has been obtained from literature and scientific articles. Companies that work with surface finishing has been contacted which shared information about both the theoretical and practical aspects of finishing techniques. Electro- and electroless plating are the two techniques which seem most suited for the replacement of the current method, black oxidation. Polishing and electropolishining can be suitable aswell, but the corrosion resistance barely increases...|$|R
50|$|The {{equipment}} {{used in the}} spot welding process consists of <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> and electrodes. The <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> function as a mechanism to hold the electrodes firmly in place and also support optional water hoses that cool the electrodes during welding. Tool holding methods include a paddle-type, light duty, universal, and regular offset. The electrodes generally are made of a low resistance alloy, usually copper, and are designed in many different shapes and sizes depending on the application needed.|$|R

50|$|In other {{situations}} this {{is less than}} optimal, because the joint between the <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> and the insert reduces rigidity. However, these tools may still be used because the overall cost savings is still greater.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that since}} {{stiffness}} (rather than strength) {{is usually the}} design driver of a <b>tool</b> <b>holder,</b> the steel used doesn't need to be particularly hard or strong as there is relatively little difference between the stiffnesses of most steel alloys.|$|E

5000|$|Drawbar force gauges {{are able}} to detect broken or {{weakening}} components of the drawbar clamping system, can give indications that the unit needs lubrication, detect gripper mis-adjustment, or demonstrate that the incorrect retention knob is being used for the machine. A retention knob is a device screwed into the narrow end of a <b>tool</b> <b>holder,</b> enabling the drawbar to pull the <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> into the spindle. With a highly accurate electronic gauge, deficiencies can be noted and corrected. Many hours of expensive machine operating time can be put to use while avoiding fretting, chatter, [...] "stuck" [...] tool holders in a spindle, etc., by employing proper preventative maintenance techniques using an accurate electronic gauge and other spindle health management tools.|$|E
50|$|By {{confining}} {{the expensive}} hard cutting tip {{to the part}} doing the actual cutting, the cost of tooling is reduced.

50|$|Boring {{can be done}} on mills, lathes or {{drill press}} machines, either with a boring head or with just a boring tool. The shorter the {{distance}} between the <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> and the material, the less distortion created from vibration or unbalanced gyroscopic effects. The greater the distance (static or dynamic mounts) the more flex in the tool or an increase in the imbalance of a moving tool. Use of a boring head increases the mass of the <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> and decreases the distance. If a vibration is created it will be at a higher frequency and the deflection of the tool from the desired path will be much smaller and easier to erase through repetitive tool passes. In the case of a dynamic tool (mill or press), the balance of the tool can be adjusted with counterweights if the tool is mounted perpendicular to the shaft or the tool length can be decreased.|$|E
