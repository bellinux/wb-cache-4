5|$|Bethe {{managed to}} work it out on the train from New York to Schenectady. He arrived at a value of 1040MHz, {{extremely}} close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculations. His paper, published in the Physical Review in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> necessary.|$|E

5|$|In May 2013 the {{investigation}} board was {{made aware of}} that two passengers had each their Mobira NMT-450 mobile telephone {{with them on the}} flights. As this had not been mentioned in the original report, AIBN conducted a review of the issue and especially if the telephones could have influenced the vertical navigation. They concluded in December <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the case, as there were no indications of interferences and that there are no instances where electromagnetic interference has been a contributing cause to an aviation accident.|$|E
5|$|In Tan Liang Joo John, Justice Judith Prakash stated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{a closed}} list, {{and that the}} court is {{entitled}} {{to take into account}} all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing bad faith. She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism – that the acts or words in question must neither impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity, propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts. However, she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Bahrain was invaded {{by both the}} Omanis and the Al Sauds. In 1802 it was governed by a 12-year-old child, when the Omani ruler Sayyid Sultan {{installed}} his son, Salim, as Governor in the Arad Fort. In 1816, the British political resident in the Gulf, William Bruce, {{received a letter from}} the Sheikh of Bahrain who was concerned about a rumour that Britain would support an attack on the island by the Imam of Muscat. He sailed to Bahrain to reassure the Sheikh <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the case and drew up an informal agreement assuring the Sheikh that Britain would remain a neutral party.|$|E

The Supreme Court requested the United States to brief the Court, and the Solicitor General filed a brief generally {{in support of the}} Monsanto position. The United States asked the Court to deny certiorari. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 5, 2012.|$|E
5|$|The 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela {{had helped}} create, {{called for the}} {{nationalisation}} of banks, gold mines and land, to ensure equal distribution of wealth. Despite these beliefs, Mandela initiated a programme of privatisation during his presidency in line with trends in other countries of the time. It has been repeatedly suggested that Mandela {{would have preferred to}} develop a social democratic economy in South Africa but <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> feasible {{as a result of the}} international political and economic situation during the early 1990s.

5|$|The {{attacks of}} 28 March were a {{continuation}} of the rapid advances that had so shattered the Fifth Army since the first days of the Spring Offensive. Prisoners of war taken by the 48th Battalion attested to the fact <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a set-piece assault, but merely an attack off the line of march. The 50th Reserve Division was in no state to renew the offensive on the following day, and 229 RIR was withdrawn from the line. It had suffered 309 casualties, with 230 RIR losing another 240.|$|E
5|$|While France {{respected}} the deadline, the Libyans limited themselves to retiring some forces, while maintaining at least 3,000 men stationed in Northern Chad. When this became evident, it embarrassed the French and caused recriminations between the French and Chadian governments. On 16 November, Mitterrand met with Gaddafi on Crete, {{under the auspices}} of the Greek prime minister Papandreou. Despite Gaddafi's declaration that all Libyan forces had been withdrawn, the next day Mitterrand admitted <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> true. However, he did not order French troops back to Chad.|$|E
5|$|A CBC investigation, {{intended}} to test {{access to information}} following Bill 29, discovered that some departments and agencies were refusing to release previously available details about how much public employees take home above their base salaries. When the media was briefed on Bill 29 the-then Deputy Minister of Justice, Donald Burrage, said that {{the provisions of the}} act which enabled the public to see bonuses offered to public service employees had not been changed. Minister Hutchings confirmed that only the base salary, or a salary range, plus a range of possible bonuses, are now available. However, he said <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a change due to Bill 29 and that the information on salaries is only voluntary.|$|E

5|$|According to Aonuma, the team's {{starting}} point for development was the Wii version of Twilight Princess: feeling they had not fully realized their goal of creating a vast and realistic world with Twilight Princess, they used their previous work {{as a foundation for}} the next title. They also sought to create a memorable experience equivalent to , by that time considered the series' most memorable title. Development lasted around five years, and according to series producer Shigeru Miyamoto, the game's budget was considered quite high for a Nintendo project. The development time was initially estimated at three years, but difficulties and changes in the game's development extended development time by a further two years: despite this, Miyamoto felt <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> wasted development time as the first two years went into experimentation. By June 2011, the game was complete aside from fine tuning and balancing its mechanics.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, {{and they had no}} idea what it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of World War I, B3, B4, and B5 were at Dover and were deployed on a line between Calais and the Goodwin Sands to protect {{the passage of the}} British Expeditionary Force to France. Each submarine would sail from Dover before dawn to be secured at the buoy marking their billet at dawn, the idea being that {{they would be able to}} slip from the buoy when they spotted an enemy ship and manoeuvre to attack. <b>That</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a good tactic was proved when B3 narrowly avoided a torpedo from a German U-boat on the morning of 2 October. Nonetheless the scheme was successful and the BEF crossed to France without loss.|$|E

5|$|During 1989 Prost {{began to}} {{contemplate}} starting his own team, as {{his relationship with}} his McLaren teammate, Ayrton Senna, had turned sour. Prost and John Barnard, formerly chief designer at McLaren, came close to founding a team in 1990; but a lack of sponsorship meant <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> possible, so Prost moved to Ferrari and Barnard left Ferrari to join Benetton. After falling out with the Italian team at the end of 1991, Prost found himself without a drive for 1992; after the failure of extensive negotiations with Guy Ligier about buying his Ligier team, Prost decided to join Williams for 1993. In 1995, when Prost was working for Renault, people began to assume that a Prost-Renault team would be formed in the near future. Renault refused Prost's request to supply engines for his team, ending the speculation.|$|E
5|$|From the 1830s to the interwar period (1919–1939), the Anglo-Norman {{was one of}} {{the main}} horses used by the French cavalry. Although author Alfred Gallier stated that it was a good breed for this use, many {{opposing}} scholars argued <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the case. Military requirements conflicted with Norman breeders, as the carriage horses preferred by the breeders were very different from the style sought by the military, which required fast horses with stamina and agility. According to military equestrian Denis Bogros, the economic weight of the Norman horse breeders was such as they negatively influenced the effectiveness of the French army until the early 20th century, producing only large, overweight trotters that became fatigued more easily than Barbs or Arabians. Bogros states that breeders of Norman horses managed to deceive the French government, through powerful lobbying groups, by selling the military rejects from the breeding programs. The Anglo-Norman was a commercial success as carriage horses, but proved worthless for the cavalry. This led to the creation of the Société du cheval de guerre (Society of the War Horse), which in 1906 severely criticized the use of the Anglo-Norman. Bogros considered the Anglo-Arabians bred near Tarbes to be much more useful for the military.|$|E
5|$|Gilmore had {{suspected}} that C. fragilis and C. agilis were the same, but Ostrom {{was able to}} demonstrate this synonymy. This greatly expanded the known material pertaining to C. fragilis, and Ostrom was able to demonstrate that Ornitholestes was quite different from Coelurus. At the time, Dale Russell had proposed that C. agilis was a species of Elaphrosaurus based on the incomplete information then published; Ostrom was also able to demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the case. Additionally, he showed {{that one of the}} three vertebrae Marsh had illustrated for C. fragilis was actually a composite of two vertebrae, one of which was later shown to come from another quarry and belonged not to Coelurus but to another, unnamed small theropod. This unnamed genus would not be the last small theropod from the Morrison Formation to be confused with Coelurus; a later discovery (1995) of a partial skeleton in Wyoming was first thought to be a new larger specimen of Coelurus, but further study showed it belonged to a different but related genus, Tanycolagreus.|$|E
