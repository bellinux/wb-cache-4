5|$|Unlike the Dyson swarm, <b>the</b> <b>constructs</b> {{making it}} up are not in orbit around the star, but would be statites—satellites {{suspended}} by use of enormous light sails using radiation pressure to counteract the star's pull of gravity. Such constructs {{would not be in}} danger of collision or of eclipsing one another; they would be totally stationary with regard to the star, and independent of one another. Because the ratio of radiation pressure to the force of gravity from a star is constant regardless of the distance (provided the statite has an unobstructed line-of-sight to the surface of its star), such statites could also vary their distance from their central star.|$|E
5|$|Most of humanity's oldest known archaeological constructions are tombs. Mostly megalithic, the {{earliest}} instances date {{to within a}} few centuries of each other, yet show a wide diversity of form and purpose. Tombs in the Iberian peninsula have been dated through thermoluminescence to c. 4510BCE, and some burials at the Carnac stones in Brittany also {{date back to the}} fifth millennium BCE. The commemorative value of such burial sites are indicated by the fact that, at some stage, they became elevated, and that <b>the</b> <b>constructs,</b> almost from {{the earliest}}, sought to be monumental. This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to be tied to the concept of collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of ancestor-worship, a development available only to communities that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and specialized sectors of activity.|$|E

40|$|One {{method to}} grow {{artificial}} body tissue {{is to place}} a porous scaffold seeded with cells, known as a tissue construct, into a rotating bioreactor filled with a nutrient-rich fluid. The flow within the bioreactor {{is affected by the}} movement of <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> relative to <b>the</b> bioreactor which, in turn, is affected by the hydrodynamical and gravitational forces <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> experiences. <b>The</b> <b>construct</b> motion is thus coupled to the flow within the bioreactor. Over the timescale of a few hours, <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> appears to move in a periodic orbit but, over tens of hours, <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> drifts from periodicity. In the biological literature, this effect is often attributed to the change in density of <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> that occurs via tissue growth. In this paper, we show that weak inertia can cause <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> to drift from its periodic orbit over the same timescale as tissue growth. We consider the coupled flow and construct motion problem within a rotating high-aspect- ratio vessel bioreactor. Using an asymptotic analysis, we investigate the case where the Reynolds number is large but the geometry of the bioreactor yields a small reduced Reynolds number, resulting in a weak inertial effect. In particular, to accurately couple the bioreactor and porous flow regions, we extend the nested boundary layer analysis of Dalwadi et al. (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 798, pp. 88 – 139, 2016) to include moving walls and the thin region between <b>the</b> porous <b>construct</b> and <b>the</b> bioreactor wall. This allows us to derive a closed system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> trajectory, from which we show that neglecting inertia results in periodic orbits; we solve the inertia-free problem analytically, calculating the periodic orbits in terms of the system parameters. Using a multiple-scale analysis, we then systematically derive a simpler system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that describe the long-time drift of <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> due to <b>the</b> effect of weak inertia. We investigate the bifurcations of <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> trajectory behaviour, and the limit cycles that appear when <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> is less dense than the surrounding fluid and the rotation rate is large enough. Thus, we are able to predict when <b>the</b> tissue <b>construct</b> will drift towards a stable limit cycle within the bioreactor and when it will drift out until it hits the bioreactor edg...|$|R

500|$|Carme Juncadella {{produced}} a systematic review of research as of 2013 {{related to the}} impact of NVC on the development of empathy. She found 13 studies which met her inclusion criteria (three were published in peer reviewed journals; ten were unpublished theses or researcher reports). Eleven of these suggested an increase in empathy subsequent to the application of NVC (five of these with evidence of statistical significance) and two did not. Juncadella notes several shortcomings of her review. None of the studies she included were randomized and only three used validated instruments. As a result she used a narrative synthesis review format, which, [...] "lacks precision," [...] but allows the summarization of studies of different types, sizes, outcome measures and aims. She suggests the primary limitation of her review is that a number of relevant studies exist that could not be included due to lack of availability. She suggests these might have significantly altered her results. Finally, she includes the following caveat: [...] "I must mention the inevitable subjectivity bias present throughout the whole review. In spite of the efforts made towards 'disciplined subjectivity'... my decisions show a degree of uncertainty and inaccuracy born via the tension between the weak evidence of the studies and my own convictions about the NVC model." [...] Her overall assessment of the current research on NVC's efficacy in promoting the development of empathy is that the results are promising, but [...] "would need to be confirmed with further studies bearing stronger designs and more appropriate measures." [...] She notes that a major shortcoming of the existing research is the [...] "mismatch between <b>the</b> <b>constructs</b> of the model and the validated empathy measures" [...] and suggests that improved instruments need to be developed to adequately test NVC.|$|E
500|$|It is {{revealed}} in the comic series Halo: Escalation that when the Didact fell into the slipspace portal, he was teleported to Halo Installation 03, where he slaughters Spartan Black Team.

He accesses the portal within the Abyss to access the Composers Forge, a world where he acquires more Composers. He strikes a bargain with the Forge's monitor, 859 Static Carillon; Static will bring the Halo to the Forge and in return the Didact will cease his creation of Promethean Knights from composed humans, as Static considers <b>the</b> <b>constructs</b> [...] "abominations". However, the Didact soon finds his plans threatened by Spartan Blue Team, consisting of the Master Chief and his old squad-mates Fred, Linda, and Kelly. The Didact confronts and attempts to kill Blue Team, summoning an army of newly-created Prometheans to back him up. While Static Carillon fulfills it's end of the bargain, bringing the Halo over to the Forge, it also turns on the Didact and decides to help the Spartans as the Didact violated his side of their compact by creating more Prometheans. The Didact goes to the Halo to use it to use it against Earth. He almost kills the Chief before Static intervenes to save him by teleporting the Didact into the ring's control center. When the Master Chief arrives at the control room, the Didact prepares for another fight, but the Chief confuses him by deliberately activating the Halo. This turns out to be a trick, allowing Static to detach the control center and launch it into the Forge, destroying the Composers, where the pulses released from their destruction strike the Didact, disintegrating his body but digitizing his mind, leaving him a powerful threat waiting to be unleashed.|$|E
