Here I offer you a third part of my money, and all you've got to do is to take it and go away peaceable. I'd be willin' to bet two to one that it's more than you {{expected}} to get, and yet you are not satisfied; now, I'll be hanged if I'm going to do business with you.'--'You can be hanged if you like,' says I, 'but you'll do the business all the same.'--'No, I won't,' says he, and he turns <b>to</b> <b>Putty</b> Henderson. 'Now, Putty,' says he, 'you've got a pile more sense that this pal of yourn, and I'm goin' to see if I can't do business with you. Now, you and me together can lick this Tommy Randall just as easy as not, and if you'll help me do it I'll not only divide the money with you, but I'll give you fifty dollars extra, so that instead of fifteen hundred and fifty dollars--that's all he'd given you, if he didn't cheat you--you'll have sixteen hundred, and I'll have fifteen hundred instead of the thousand and thirty-three dollars which I would have had left if my first offer had been took. So, Putty, {{what do you say to}} that?' Now, Putty, he must have been a little sore with me on account of the arguments we'd had about dividin', and he was mighty glad besides to get the chance of makin' fifty dollars extry, and so he said it was all right, and he'd agree. Then I thought it was about time for me to take in some of my sail, and says I: 'Jerry, that's a pretty good joke, and you can take my hat as soon as I get a new one, but of course I don't mean to be hard on you, and if you really have bills to pay to-morrow I'll take a third, and Putty'll take another, and we'll go away peaceful.'--'No, you won't,' sings out Jerry, and with that he jumps out of bed right at me, and Putty Henderson he comes at me from the other side, and, between the two, they gave me the worst lickin' I ever got in my born days, and then they dragged me down stairs and kicked me out the front door, and I had hardly time to pick myself up before I saw a policeman about a block off, and if he hadn't been a fat one he'd had me sure. It wouldn't have been pleasant, for I was a good deal wanted about that time.|$|E

This is his purpose, and to achieve it everything turns <b>to</b> <b>putty</b> in his hands: the actor, the set designer, the costumes, the musician, the dancer.

Boudin had used a similar treatment in the Blue Bedroom at Leeds Castle in Kent, England. Rather than attempting <b>to</b> <b>putty</b> and polish the rough sawn timbers he chose to highlight the porous texture of the paneling.

5000|$|Although present-day Old Harford Road {{never has}} been part of the Maryland State Highway system, rapid {{suburban}} development throughout the Parkville-Carney area following World War II brought substantial traffic increases to the city- and county-maintained road. In particular, completion of the nearby Parkville High School and Perring Plaza Shopping Center spurred increases in the late 1950s and early 1960s, respectively. Major improvements (including widening, resurfacing and construction of curbs/sewers) occurred over various segments in the following years: 1971 (north of Joppa Road), 1972 (north of Taylor Avenue), 1975 (north of Proctor Lane), 1979 (intersection with Joppa Road), 1981 (near Summit Avenue), 1984 (Northern Parkway to Alvarado Square), 1990 (Satyr Hill Road to Joppa Road), and 2000-2001 (Taylor Avenue <b>to</b> <b>Putty</b> Hill Avenue). Construction of an overpass at the Baltimore Beltway (Interstate 695) in 1961 resulted in relocation of the roadway about 300 ft west of the original right-of-way. This reconstruction also eliminated an existing [...] "y" [...] intersection with Satyr Hill Road.

5000|$|Polymer clays {{contain a}} basis of PVC resin and a liquid plasticizer, making it a {{plastisol}}. Polymer clay plastisol is also categorized as a plastigel because of its rheological properties. It is a high yield thixotropic material; when a sufficient force is applied the material yields, flows like a viscous liquid until that force is removed, whereupon it returns to being a solid. This plasticity {{is what makes it}} useful as modeling clay as opposed <b>to</b> <b>putty</b> or paste. Plastigels retain their shape even when heat is applied, which is why polymer clay does not melt or droop when oven cured. Various gelling agents are added to give it this property such as aminated bentonite, metallic soaps, or fumed silica. The base resin can be modified in various ways. Mineral oil, lecithin, and odorless mineral spirits can be added to reduce its viscosity or alter its working properties. Small amounts of zinc oxide, kaolin, or other fillers are sometimes added to increase opacity, elastic modulus, or compression strength. Polymer clay is available in many colors, which can be mixed to create a wide range of colors or gradient blends. Special-effect colors and composites include translucent, fluorescent, phosphorescent, and faux [...] "pearls," [...] "metallics," [...] and [...] "stone." ...|$|E
