50|$|Many General-Purpose Modeling {{languages}} {{already have}} <b>tool</b> <b>support</b> {{available in the}} form of CASE tools. Domain-specific language languages tend to have too small a market size to support the construction of a bespoke CASE tool from scratch. Instead, most <b>tool</b> <b>support</b> for domain-specific language languages is built based on existing domain-specific language frameworks or through domain-specific language environments.|$|E
50|$|Software {{development}} {{based on}} formal methods: Software <b>tool</b> <b>support</b> {{based on some}} mathematical formalism includes model checking, process algebras, and Petri nets. The Box Structure Method might be one such means of specifying and designing a software product. Verification that the design correctly implements the specification is performed through team review, often with software <b>tool</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E
30|$|DM, RM and {{measurement}} processes {{have very few}} <b>tools</b> to <b>support</b> their activities {{when compared to other}} SPM areas. Only three <b>tools</b> <b>support</b> RM, three <b>tools</b> <b>support</b> measurement and two <b>tools</b> <b>support</b> DM. Researchers should focus more on these areas as they are inadequately <b>supported</b> by proper <b>tools.</b> RM should particularly attract tool builders’ attention. Controlling the risks in software projects in general (Bannerman 2008), and global software projects in particular (Persson et al. 2009), greatly contributes to project success.|$|R
