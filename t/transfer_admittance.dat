40|$|In this study, we numerically model a vibro-acoustic system {{consisting}} of a flexible micro-perforated plate (f-MPP) and an acoustic medium. Combined with a back-cavity, micro-perforated plates are considered as a promising noise control technology due to their tunable, wide-band sound absorption characteristics and robust performance. An MPP consists of a plate with uniformly distributed perforations whose diameters are {{in the order of}} a millimeter. These perforations are small enough to dissipate the acoustic perturbations due to the viscous effects caused by the presence of the Stokes layers. When the plate is rigid, the sound dissipation mechanism for a specific frequency bandwidth is determined by the perforation diameter, plate thickness, plate porosity and the back cavity depth. Yet, when the plate is flexible, additional absorption peaks, which cannot be determined by the parameters mentioned before, are observed in the measurements. This phenomenon is due to the vibro-acoustic coupling of the flexible plate and the acoustic medium. To model the vibro-acoustic system numerically, we couple two 3 D cylindrical acoustic mediums, i. e. incident and back cavity regions, with a flexible plate {{consisting of}} shell elements.

40|$|Flow duct systems, such as {{automotive}} exhausts and ventilation systems, are {{an important}} source of noise disturbance. These systems not only contain significant sources of sound, but also act as an efficient transfer path for the noise generated upstream. Because of the growing customer expectations and the restrictive legal requirements regarding the noise emission to the environment, the need for efficient characterization and prediction tools for the aeroacoustic behavior of flow duct systems emerges. The acoustic design of flow duct systems is often based on network modeling approaches, where models for the individual components are connected to predict the behavior of the entire system. In this framework, the components are typically described using acoustic two-port or multi-port models. Such model can be derived analytically for simple geometries, but more complex components require numerical simulations or a dedicated experimental campaign. The first part of this dissertation therefore investigates efficient numerical and experimental techniques for the characterization of flow duct components using two-port or multi-port models. An important aspect of the experimental characterization of a component is the decomposition of the acoustic pressure field into downstream and upstream propagating waves. Therefore, robust iterative techniques are presented in this dissertation which optimize the parameters of the underlying model to improve the accuracy of the decomposition. The numerical part of this dissertation focuses on time-domain models for the flow-acoustic behavior of perforates in a flow duct. These models include a hybrid method, based on the linearized Navier-Stokes equations, and a recursive formulation for a transfer-admittance. In the second part of this dissertation, the developed two-port and multi-port characterization techniques are applied to three components, selected for their industrial relevance. First, a multi-port model is used to describe the acoustic effect of a butterfly valve, which acts {{at the same time as}} a shield for noise propagating through the system and as an efficient source of sound. Secondly, an indirect measurement technique is presented for the acoustic impedance of locally reacting wall treatments. Finally, the characterization techniques are applied to investigate the potential of modal filters, a novel silencer topology using micro-perforated panels.

40|$|High {{voltage power}} {{transformers}} {{are designed to}} withstand a variety of overvoltages and short circuit forces. Occurrence of these events in a power system is natural, inevitable, {{and one of the}} main causes of transformer failure. Therefore, an early and reliable detection of an incipient fault is paramount. To this end, diagnostic testing and condition monitoring, not only enables power utilities in early detection of incipient fault-like conditions, but also is a practical way of optimizing existing assets, lowering operating costs, scheduling maintenance, preventing unplanned outages, etc. and consequently improve efficiency. Over the years, many monitoring and diagnostic methods have evolved. In par- ticular, low voltage impulse and frequency response analysis or transfer function approaches have emerged as useful tools in detecting winding deformations. Literature study reveals that although much has been acclaimed about these methods, advancement in interpretation of acquired data must be rigorously pursued, to facilitate a more meaningful assessment. As a matter of fact, diagnosis (which means interpretation of monitored data) has at-the-most been confined to a mere comparison of two subsequently acquired data sets. This philosophy certainly needs to be improved, to realize the true potential of monitoring/diagnostic tools. Achieving this goal calls for newer impetus. It is natural that there will arise many problems while achieving this goal and they will have to be resolved. Keeping these aspects in mind, the objective of this thesis was aimed at developing Solutions to two specific topics that are closely related to and concern the transformer winding, namely, * An efficient solution to the generalized model of a transformer winding, with no particular limitation on the size of network and number of windings, no restriction on circuit topology and terminal condition, etc. * Propose a method to locate the position, quantum and type of change (i. e. deformation) a model winding undergoes, based on terminal measurements. Details of these approaches are presented in this thesis, which is divided into two parts. 1. A comprehensive analysis of the behaviour of a transformer winding under impulse excitation and its interaction with adjacent windings was until now severely limited, due to the simplifying assumptions imposed (by the existing approaches), like neglecting interaction with neighbouring windings, Ignoring loss, considering only a few sections, etc. thereby rendering the computed results less accurate. A solution considering all these aspects often times results in a very large-sized circuit that needs to be solved. Although circuit simulation software afford iterative solutions, a direct estimation of poles and zeros of any desired network function is not possible. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, a novel and closed-form (i. e. analytical) solution based on state space analysis is proposed. It is shown, how the renders the entire computation to be purely numeric. Thus, time-consuming symbolic manipulations are avoided. With this feature, there is practically no limit on the size of network and no restriction on circuit topologies that can be considered. So, virtually any number of windings of a transformer can be considered, permitting a comprehensive analysis of winding behaviour and its interactions. Further, the formulation also permits computation of poles and zeros of any desired network function (e. g. <b>transfer</b> <b>admittance),</b> response to any excitation (e. g. neutral current, transferred surge), estimation of voltage distribution, etc. with little extra effort. Hence, it would be apppropriate to term the proposed method as a " solution. For the sole purpose of demonstration, a large-sized network (representing a two-winding transformer with 250 sections/winding) was solved and required only 700 seconds. This shows the time-efficiency achieved, and also that it is free from issues like numerical instability, convergence problems, etc. encountered in some of the existing methods. 2. Detection of mechanical deformation in transformer windings can be achieved with a fair degree of sensitivity using frequency response methods. However, a major challenge that has remained elusive is ascertaining the of damage" and likewise location along the winding". It is needless to say that finding these answers is crucial. Ideally, a diagnosis tool is expected to be endowed with powers to answer these questions. Therefore, it is desirable to explore alternative ways of harnessing these embedded features, if any. This was the next motivation. Obviously, a direct solution to this problem on an actual transformer winding is far too complex. Hence, in this preliminary effort a solution was attempted considering a model winding. However, care was taken to incorporate other winding-related nuances as far as practicable. The method was formulated based on quantities measured at the terminals. In the second part of the thesis, a novel algorithm is proposed for determining the location, extent and type of changes intrroduced in a model winding, based on terminal measurements. It employs the well-known properties of driving-point functions and adopts an iterative circuit synthesis approach. From knowledge of the measured short-circuit and open-circuit natural frequencies, and some relevant winding design data, an equivalent circuit was synthesized (called reference circuit). Next, changes were introduced at different locations in the model winding and natural frequencies measured again. Corresponding to every new set of measured natural frequencies, a fresh circuit was synthesized (with topology remaining unchanged). A comparison of these circuits with the reference circuit revealed that a mapping could be established between changes introduced in the model winding and those predicted by the synthesized circuits. Initially, the underlying principle is discussed, and thereafter, the experimental results are presented for both continuous-disc and interleaved winding representations. The case studies involved examples wherein changes in the model winding were made to elements connected to a single tap, two physically different tap positions, multiple changes to different elements, and so on. In all cases, the positions of all the `changes' were reasonably well locatable, and so was the `type of change'. The results were very encouraging. In summary, localization of changes based on terminal measurements, is shown to be a possibility. Lastly, it is conjectured that these findings could be of some assistance in addressing the ultimate task of locating mechanical deformations in actual transformer windings...|$|E
40|$|Magnetizing {{harmonics}} {{in power}} systems have received limited attention. The general {{belief is that}} they do not reach harmful levels in interconnected networks. Moreover the modelling of non-linearities is not a straightforward procedure and so there has been little motivation to develop appropriate methodologies that allow a thorough investigation to take place. In this thesis the problem of magnetizing harmonics in power systems is investigated. The results obtained show that, contrary to expectations, magnetizing currents can give rise to a considerable harmonic distortion in the voltage wave form of power networks operating under loaded conditions. The method adopted in this research linearizes each magnetic non-linearity around a base operating point. The linearization exercise takes place in the complex-conjugate harmonic space and the individual linearized equations may be interpreted as harmonic Norton equivalents. These equations combine easily {{with each other and with}} the <b>transfer</b> <b>admittances</b> representing the linear part of the network. The overall process of linearization may be seen as a linearization of the entire network and can also be interpreted as a multi-nodal, polyphase harmonic Norton equivalent. This problem is non-linear and the harmonic solution is reached by an iterative process. A re-linearization of the network takes place at each iterative step and so the solution is found through a Newton-type procedure. Several iterative strategies are tested, including unified and sequential solutions with either single or multi-evaluated Jacobians. A hitherto neglected problem which also receives attention is the harmonic modelling of non-homogenous transmission lines. A novel approach to the modelling of the frequency dependent part of the transmission line is also presented.

The goal {{is to determine the}} optimal dimensions of the pipe, by which a desired steady state sound spectrum can be achieved. By modifying the geometry of the pipe body, the eigenfrequencies of the acoustic resonator can be tuned in order to amplify or repress given harmonic partials in the pipe sound. Since the dependence of the eigenfrequencies on the pipe dimensions is quite complex, obtaining the optimal scaling parameters is not trivial. To overcome this difficulty two alternative approaches are suggested and examined. In case of simple pipe forms, such as chimney pipes, the <b>transfer</b> (input <b>admittance)</b> function and the eigenfrequencies of the pipe are calculated by means of a one-dimensional model. However, when the pipe geometry is irregular (e. g. pipes with tuning slot) constructing a simple pipe model is not trivial.

These modeling techniques serve as guidelines in the development of an optimization algorithm. The usefulness and applicability of the methodology are proven by validation measurements performed on pipes built with optimized dimensions...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Active {{transmission}} lines, a {{generalization of}} classical transmission lines, are useful electrical devices. They can be utilized to realize distributed amplifiers and to obtain other electrical characteristics unattainable with passive lines. Active lines have historical significance and model many physical processes including heat conduction in an internally heated material, a vibrating string, pressure waves in gas, neutron diffusion and fission, and semiconductor photodetection. This paper fully develops {{the analysis and}} synthesis of active transmission lines using a network theory approach. An active line is characterized by distributed series voltage and shunt current sources {{in addition to the}} passive line parameters. These sources may be of independent and/or dependent type. It is shown that independent sources may be removed from the line if appropriate modifications' in port conditions are made. Extraction integrals are formulated for this purpose. Examples of independent sources include initial condition generators; they also occur in devices exhibiting active coupling such as the traveling-wave transistor. Dependent sources however change the two-port parameters of the active line. These sources have their outputs controlled by either line voltage or current (a source at position x has an output which depends on either voltage or current at position x). Two basic types of lines are therefore possible. The uniform active line having dependent distributed sources is completely analyzed. Its traveling-wave characteristics including characteristic impedances and propagation functions are presented. Laplace transformation techniques are used to analyze the driving-point and <b>transfer</b> <b>admittances,</b> gain, bandwidth, step response, rise and delay time, and sensitivity of uniform rcg active lines. The general nature of the pole-zero patterns of nonuniform active lines having distributed dependent sources are investigated using several results from differential equation theory. Their two-port parameters are readily expressed using the basic set notation and self-adjoint properties of the active line equations. Lack of pole-zero cancellation is noted utilizing the Wronskian of the basic set solutions. Sturm-Liouville theory establishes the general pole-zero locations. many of the powerful theorems concerning lumped passive networks are seen to parallel those of active lines. Active transmission lines are readily synthesized directly in the time or frequency domain using variational calculus techniques. The parameter distributions required to produce specified port response for arbitrary excitations and loadings (consistent with parameter bounds, etc.) are generated by expressions involving voltage and current along the original line and a so-called adjoint line. The method is readily implemented by digital and hybrid computers. At the present time, active transmission lines cannot be realized because of the inability to distribute dependent sources along a passive line. Therefore artificial active lines are presently utilized The topology and two-port parameter requirements of the iterative two port are discussed. Future advances in solid-state electronics and thin-film technology should overcome this difficulty. Several current research studies involving semiconductor bulk effects and solid-state traveling-wave amplifiers are cited. Although this thesis is concerned with the class of active distributed network having an active transmission line equivalent, the various considerations are readily extendable to networks having other differential models. more generally then, this investigation is concerned with developing methods for analyzing and synthesizing active distributed networks...|$|R

The predicted large-scale lithospheric stress regime (compression or extension) is consistent with the world stress map (thrust or normal faulting). Both recent compiled high-accuracy residual topography and the predicted dynamic topography yield ∼ 1 [*]km amplitude long-wavelength dynamic topography, inconsistent with recent studies suggesting amplitudes of ∼ 100 to ∼ 500 m. Such studies use a constant, positive <b>admittance</b> (<b>transfer</b> function between topography and gravity), in contrast to the evidence which shows that the earth has a spatially and wavelength-dependent admittance, with large, negative admittances between ∼ 4000 and ∼ 10 ^ 4 [*]km wavelengths...|$|R
40|$|A vehicle on {{the road}} {{encounters}} an unsteady flow due to turbulence in the natural wind, the unsteady wakes from other vehicles {{and as a result}} of traversing through the stationary wakes of road side obstacles. There is increasing concern about potential differences in aerodynamic behaviour measured in steady flow wind tunnel conditions and that which occurs for vehicles {{on the road}}. It is possible to introduce turbulence into the wind tunnel environment (e. g. by developing active turbulence generators) but on-road turbulence is wide ranging in terms of both its intensity and frequency and it would be beneficial to better understand what aspects of the turbulence are of greatest importance to the aerodynamic performance of vehicles. There has been significant recent work on the characterisation of turbulent airflow relevant to road vehicles. The simulation of this time-varying airflow is now becoming possible in wind tunnels and in CFD. Less is known about the range of turbulence length scales and intensities that are significant to the performance of vehicles. It is only necessary to simulate (experimentally or computationally) the Venn intersection of the range of conditions experienced and the range that are important to the vehicle's performance. The focus of this work is on transient yaw fluctuations. Time-resolved simulations of simple two dimensional parametric geometries subjected to yaw transients at a range of different time scales were conducted using Exa Powerflow. The effects of model geometry, Reynolds number yaw fluctuation amplitude and superposition were investigated. It was found that, in general, the flow could be treated as quasi-steady for reduced frequencies below 0. 3 (based on model length and freestream velocity), which is consistent with theory. The most significant changes were observed in a critical reduced frequency range between ω R = 0. 3 and ω R = 1. 5 (scales of 4 - 20 vehicle lengths, or periods of 0. 6 to 3 s for a vehicle at 30 m/s). Higher frequencies will have significant effects, but these were observed to show little sensitivity to frequency above the critical range. Small physical features on real vehicles will add importance to smaller, but not larger, scales. The dynamic effects were largely independent of Reynolds number, including for near-inviscid conditions, indicating that the sources of the non-quasi-steady response were not viscous in origin. Increasing yaw amplitude or combining multiple frequency components did not have a summative impact suggesting that it may not be possible to describe vehicle response to transient conditions using linear concepts such as <b>transfer</b> or <b>admittance</b> functions...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the transformerless synthesis of passive electrical networks, which is motivated by mechanical control based on inerters. Passive network synthesis is a significant topic of circuits and systems theory, which is to physically design a circuit containing passive components according to a given function describing the network, such as an impedance, <b>admittance,</b> <b>transfer</b> function, etc. The most general one-port transformerless realization approach, Bott-Duffin procedure, always generates many redundant elements, and the transformerless realization problem for multi-port passive networks is still an open question. After the 1970 s, research interest of passive network synthesis has declined due to the rapid development of integrated circuits. More than one decade ago, a new kind of passive mechanical elements named the inerter was invented, which completes the analogy between passive mechanical and electrical systems. As a result, passive network synthesis {{can be applied to the}} design of passive mechanical networks, which has been successfully utilized in a series of mechanical control systems, such as vehicle suspensions, train suspensions, machine vibration systems, etc. Such a passive control method can have lower cost and higher reliability compared with the active control approach, and it has been shown that the introduction of the inerter can certainly enhance the system performances. Since in practice mechanical systems usually require low complexity due to the limitation of weight and space, research interest in transformerless synthesis of passive networks become significant and urgent for more effective mechanical control. In this thesis, the minimal realizability problem of a biquadratic impedance with double poles and zeros as a seven-element series-parallel network is investigated, which is the series or parallel connection of a three-element seriesparallel network and a four-element series-parallel network. Such a class of biquadratic impedances can provide fast transitions, which is expected to have advantages in some mechanical systems. A necessary and sufficient condition for such a realizability is presented. This thesis also solves the minimal realization problem for a third-order real symmetric matrix as the admittance of a three-port resistive network. A necessary and sufficient condition for the realizability is derived and the configurations to cover the condition are also presented. The investigation can provide guidance on minimal realization problems of more general n-port resistive networks and can be a first critical step toward solving the realizability of n-port RLC networks. Moreover, the results can be utilized to solve minimal realizations of one-port or two-port passive mechanical or electrical networks based on the elements extraction approach. In addition, this thesis {{is concerned with}} the realization problem for a class of transfer functions as a two-port RC ladder network with a specified gain. The cascade realization methodology and the continuous gain adjustment technique based on the congruent transformation are utilized. A systematic procedure is established for such a realizability. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
