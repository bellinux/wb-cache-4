The two men greatly respected one another and shared a bond in that they both had past military experience. <b>Their</b> <b>positive</b> relationship facilitated Clark’s many accomplishments while in Sapporo and accounted for the wide latitude Clark was given in implementing not just SAC programs, but also his influence on the colonial development of Hokkaido.|$|E

5|$|To {{complete}} her {{contract with}} Paramount Pictures, Wong made {{a string of}} B movies in the late 1930s. Often dismissed by critics, the films gave Wong non-stereotypical roles which were publicized in the Chinese-American press for <b>their</b> <b>positive</b> images. These smaller-budgeted films could be bolder than the higher-profile releases and Wong used this to her advantage to portray successful, professional, Chinese-American characters. Competent and proud of their Chinese heritage, these roles worked against the prevailing U.S. film portrayals of Chinese Americans. In contrast to the usual official Chinese condemnation of Wong's film roles, the Chinese consul to Los Angeles gave his approval to the final scripts of two of these films, Daughter of Shanghai (1937) and King of Chinatown (1939).|$|E

25|$|A {{person can}} have a high {{self-esteem}} and hold it confidently where {{they do not need}} reassurance from others to maintain <b>their</b> <b>positive</b> self view, whereas others with defensive, high self-esteem may still report positive self-evaluations on the Rosenberg Scale, as all high self-esteem individuals do; however, <b>their</b> <b>positive</b> self-views are fragile and vulnerable to criticism. Defensive high self-esteem individuals internalize subconscious self-doubts and insecurities, causing them to react very negatively to any criticism they may receive. There is a need for constant positive feedback from others for these individuals to maintain their feelings of self-worth. The necessity of repeated praise can be associated with boastful, arrogant behavior or sometimes even aggressive and hostile feelings toward anyone who questions the individual's self-worth, an example of threatened egotism.|$|E

25|$|All atomic nuclei, being {{composed}} of protons and neutrons, repel one another because of <b>their</b> <b>positive</b> charge. However, if the atoms {{have a high}} enough temperature and pressure (for example, {{in the core of}} the Sun), then their random motions can overcome such electrical repulsion (called the Coulomb force), and they can come close enough for the strong nuclear force to take effect, fusing them into heavier atoms.|$|E

When organic carbon is present in water, bacteria are fed by directly reducing As(V) to As(III) or by reducing the element at the binding site, releasing inorganic arsenic.|$|E

25|$|Following World War II, tubes {{intended}} {{to be used in}} series heater strings were redesigned to all have the same ("controlled") warm-up time. Earlier designs had quite-different thermal time constants. The audio output stage, for instance, had a larger cathode, and warmed up more slowly than lower-powered tubes. The result was that heaters that warmed up faster also temporarily had higher resistance, because of <b>their</b> <b>positive</b> temperature coefficient. This disproportionate resistance caused them to temporarily operate with heater voltages well above their ratings, and shortened their life.|$|E

Thereafter, a kindergarten was added and one upper grade each year until the school had a complete high school program, graduating its first senior class in 1977. Two senior traditions were established with the first graduating class: The American Christian Heritage Tour of the cities of Boston, Plymouth, Lexington, Concord, and Salem, Massachusetts taken in the spring before graduation and the unique graduation ceremony which CHA adopted, in which each graduating senior is individually recognized and lauded for <b>their</b> <b>positive</b> character qualities and impact within their class.|$|E

25|$|Supportive {{psychotherapy}} is {{also used}} in an inpatient or outpatient setting by a trained professional that focuses on areas such as coping skills, improvement of social skills and social interactions, communication, and self-esteem issues. People with SPD {{have a tendency to}} miss differences that causes an inability to pick up environmental cues and limits their experience. The perception of varied events only increases their fear for intimacy and limits them in their interpersonal relationships. Their aloofness may limit their opportunities to refine the social skills and behavior necessary to effectively pursue relationships. Socialization groups may help people with SPD. Educational strategies in which people who have SPD identify <b>their</b> <b>positive</b> and negative emotions also may be effective. Such identification helps them to learn about their own emotions and the emotions they draw out from others and to feel the common emotions with other people with whom they relate. This can help people with SPD create empathy with the outside world.|$|E
25|$|The {{adoption}} of cooperatives in Gujarat is widely attributed {{to much of}} the success in the agricultural sector, particularly sugar and dairy cooperatives. Cooperative farming has been a component of India's strategy for agricultural development since 1951. Whilst the success of these was mixed throughout the country, <b>their</b> <b>positive</b> impact on the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat have been the most significant. In 1995 alone, the two states had more registered co-operatives than any other region in the country. Out of these, the agricultural cooperatives have received much attention. Many have focused on subsidies and credit to farmers and rather than collective gathering, they have focused on facilitating collective processing and marketing of produce. However, whilst they have led to increased productivity, their effect on equity in the region has been questioned, because membership in agricultural co-operatives has tended to favour landowners whilst limiting the entry of landless agricultural labourers. An example of co-operative success in Gujarat can be illustrated through dairy co-operatives, with the particular example of Amul (Anand Milk Union Limited).|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of the social web, {{engagement}} means that customers and stakeholders, such as consumer advocacy groups and groups that criticize companies (e.g., lobby groups or advocacy organizations) are active participants rather than passive viewers. Social media use in a business or political context allows all consumers/citizens to express and share an opinion about a company's products, services or business practices, or a government's actioins. Each participating customer or non-customer (or citizen) who is participating online via social media becomes part of the marketing department (or a challenge to the marketing effort), as other customers read <b>their</b> <b>positive</b> or negative comments or reviews. Getting consumers and potential consumers (or citizens) to be engaged online is fundamental to successful social media marketing. With the advent of social media marketing, it has become increasingly important to gain customer interest in products and services, which can eventually be translated into buying behavior (or voting or donating behavior in a political context). New online marketing concepts of engagement and loyalty have emerged which aim to build customer participation and brand reputation.|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is to capture the {{diversity}} of perceptions of housing estates {{from the perspective of}} their population and from the outsiders' perspective. The thesis is divided into two parts. The theoretical part deals with the image of housing estates and <b>their</b> <b>positives</b> and negatives. In the theoretical framework, also the studies of image of housing estates from selected foreign countries are presented. The second empirical part is based on the analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted with 50 residents of 10 housing estates in Prague and the results of focus group, which was conducted with 10 geography students who were generally familiar with the reputations of studied housing estates. These two research phases aimed to reveal, if the housing estates are perceived negatively as a place to live. And if so, whether they are perceived negatively by their inhabitants, or by people who live in other parts of Prague. Next taks of the analysis was to find out what is the main problem of Prague's housing estates and, on the contrary, what are <b>their</b> <b>positives.</b> In the conclusion, the thesis sums up, that despite the prevailing negative image of the housing estates, in the eyes of their inhabitants, the are perceived rather agreeable and many positive elements can be found.
