2500|$|David Yates {{was born}} in 1963 in Lancashire, England. His parents {{died when he was}} young. Raised in the village of Rainhill, Yates was {{inspired}} to pursue a career in filmmaking after watching Steven Spielberg's 1975 movie Jaws. Before her death, Yates' mother bought him a Super 8mm camera. He used this to shoot various films [...] in which his friends and family featured. One such film, The Ghost Ship, was shot on board the vessel where his uncle worked as a cook. He attended St Helens College where he completed the courses of sociology, politics, and literature before moving on to the University of Essex. Yates said that he [...] "used <b>to</b> <b>skive</b> off college all the time" [...] and never expected to join university before being surprised by his A-Level exam results. While at the University of Essex, Yates formed the Film and Video Production Society. He graduated with a BA Government in 1987.|$|E

40|$|L'article {{concerne}} la restauration d'un livre du XVIIIe siècle imprimé à Würzburg. Le travail a été réalisé dans le cadre d'un workshop au Centro del bel libro, à Ascona, en Suisse, sous la direction de Renate Mesmer. Pour préserver autant que possible le livre original, les techniques les moins invasives ont été appliquées afin de réparer le papier et la couverture, mais le livre a dû être recousu en totalité. The article {{concerns the}} complete restoration of an 18 th century vellum bound book printed in Würzburg. All {{work was done}} during a workshop at the Centro del bel libro in Ascona, Switzerland, {{under the direction of}} Ms Renate Mesmer. To preserve as much as possible of the original book, the least invasive techniques were applied in repairing paper, vellum, and the endbands, but the bookblock had to be disbound and re-sewn completely. In a new method, the vacuum table was used to force the Yapp edges back to their original 90 -degree. To repair a circular hole in the cover, the replacement vellum was skived on the hair-side in contrast <b>to</b> usually <b>skiving</b> on the flesh-side, using a glass shard in addition <b>to</b> the <b>skiving</b> knife...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a successful attempt to automate a manual process in footwear industry. The process is called skiving of leather components {{and it is}} one of the early processes necessary for the assembly of shoe uppers. Skiving is the localised thinning of leather components, mainly at some of their edge regions. The purpose of <b>skiving</b> is <b>to</b> produce quality decorative edges or more importantly to enable attaching and joining components without forming thick, discomforting and weak joints. Although other processes in footwear manufacturing have been subject to partial or full automation, skiving has been performed for decades now with a standard mechanism that requires 3 -dimensional manipulation of the components by a human operator. This research work was directed towards two main aims. One was to establish a novel method on the basis of which skiving may be performed without the need of human assistance. The developed method is called dynamic matrix skiving and it is capable of performing skiving on leather components by generating and actuating skive patterns as sets of finite elements of <b>skived</b> area <b>to</b> a given resolution. Following derivation and study of the method for skiving, the second phase was aimed at implementing a fully automatic skiving system. The main requirement from the system was to be an intelligent, component oriented, flow through, processing device. This required the capability to receive input components at any orientation and position along its transport mechanism, to recognise them as to their identity and relative position, and <b>to</b> perform <b>skiving</b> upon them without moving them or disturb their continuous flow throughout the entire operation. Individual chapters in this thesis describe the study and experimentation with regards <b>to</b> dynamic matrix <b>skiving,</b> and all logical steps taken to identify the necessary elements and implement their integration to produce the automated skiving system. The concluding part of this work includes presentation of the results obtained from the automated system, and it identifies the areas where further research and development is needed in order to improve the quality of its output...|$|R
50|$|Madsen {{made his}} Superliga debut with Odense BK in July 1999, and spent three {{seasons with the}} club, winning the 2002 Danish Cup. When Odense manager Troels Bech moved to league rivals FC Midtjylland (FCM) in the summer 2002, Madsen joined him, {{and went on to}} become a {{mainstay}} in the FCM. Madsen spent seven seasons with FCM, scoring eight goals in 126 Superliga games for the club. Known for a good technique, he suffered from an increasing number of injuries, and decided to end his career in January 2010. He went on to coach second-tier club Skive IK, with former FCM teammate Michael Hansen as manager.On June 24, 2013 got promoted and was assigned lead manager of Skive IK, as the club got relegated and the former manager left the club, leaving the manager seat empty. The club had many candidates but found that Claus Madsen was the perfect choice and the right manager <b>to</b> lead <b>Skive</b> IK <b>to</b> win the division and earn promotion to move back up to the Danish 1st Division. On 5 March 2014 he resigned as manager of <b>Skive</b> due <b>to</b> personal reasons.|$|R

50|$|Farum's {{first full}} {{season as a}} {{professional}} club was a fruitful one, edging out Aalborg Chang and <b>Skive</b> <b>to</b> fifth place by one point, gaining promotion {{for the second time}} in two years into the 1st Division. The club's meteoric rise was slowed at first with the new challenge of playing in the Danish second tier, though it was not stopped however, ending the 1999-2000 campaign with a respectable eighth-place finish, winning the same amount of games as it lost. Farum, however, remained unable to make any sort of impact in the Danish Cup, having lost in the first round for the last three years since making its debut in the tournament in the 1997-98 season. The following year saw some progression in both the league and cup, improving on the previous year's finish by finishing fifth, three spots and nine points behind second-placed promotion winners Vejle, as well as breaking out of the first round of the Danish Cup to eventually fall to Fremad Amager in the third round following a 2-1 loss.|$|R
40|$|This study aimed <b>to</b> {{develop a}} <b>SkiVes</b> {{training}} curriculum {{model for the}} engineering education program based on Work-Based Learning (WBL) in Malaysian Polytechnic. The construction of the model was intended to assist and guide the lecturers in carrying out the teaching and application of generic skills and values for the engineering students that enrolled in WBL education programme. This study used the method of Design and Developmental Research Approach introduced by Ritchey and Klien (2007) to develop the model. Based on this method, the study was divided into three phases. In the first phase, a survey using needs analysis was conducted on 65 students who had just finished studying engineering at the Malaysian Polytechnic based on WBL to see the need to train and deploy the elements of generic skills and values on themselves. The data was analyzed by descriptive statistics using the software Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) version 21. 0. The interpretation of this requirement {{was based on the}} mean value and standard deviation. In the second phase, Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) approach and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) were exploited to develop a model based on the opinions and decisions of 12 and 9 panel of experts for Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) repectively. The data of Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) approach was interpreted based on the acceptance of its major components and elements accepted by a panel of experts. Meanwhile the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) approach was the experts’ agreement on the position of each of the main components from the aspect of driving power and dependence power. The third phase was the usability evaluation model involving 21 experts of engineering lecturers evaluating the model using Modified Nominal Group Technique (Modified NGT). Engineering lecturers were selected because they were the target group that used the SkiVes training curriculum model, they were directly involved in the engineering study programme based on Work-based Learning (WBL) at the Malaysian Polytechnic. Acceptance percentage point score was calculated to determine the suitability of all components and elements in the model. Acceptance percentage point score must be above 70 % for each component and element to be considered suitable and applicable. The overall findings of the first phase showed that the students stated that there were no educational training either on a scheduled basis or through the application in the field of courses followed, and there were no materials or resources directly focused on the elements of generic skills and values. Next the students agreed to be trained and to apply the elements of generic skills and values before they enrolled in the industry. Therefore, the study <b>to</b> construct <b>SkiVes</b> training curriculum model is required. Findings from the second phase generated the training curriculum model that involved 5 keys component and elements contained therein. The main components included the objectives, content, teaching aids, teaching strategies (delivery) and evaluation. Further, the findings showed that all three phases of the main components and elements were located at a suitable level and can be implemented since the score percentage value of above 70 % was accomplished. This development of model is able to guide the engineering lecturers in the process of implementation and training involving generic skills and values for engineering programmes based on Work-Based Learning (WBL) that is implemented at the Malaysian Polytechnic...|$|R
5000|$|For the fit to last, so to speak, {{the boot}} {{had to hold}} the shape. In the {{construction}} of the boot itself, as with {{the construction of the}} last, Charlie had some secrets. He drew on a lifetime of incorporating ideas and practices from the dozens of bootmakers with whom he worked and his own, constant effort to improve his practices. By the 1970s, something like a Charlie Dunn [...] "code" [...] for bootmaking had taken shape. Put simply, he made boots the old-fashioned way, never trying something new unless it improved the boot, and sometimes not even then, for he preferred the traditional way. This [...] "code" [...] had practices that were not negotiable for Charlie. The boot must have hard maple, not plastic or metal, pegs in securing various elements. He insisted on spinning his own flax threads for stitching and binding, though doing so {{took a long time to}} perfect and was expensive. Nylon thread, though sometimes more durable, was never used. Though almost every other bootmaker, including custom fitters, used plastic toe boxes as inserts to shape the toe of the boot, Charlie insisted on shaping them exclusively with leather boxes because they were tougher, could be built in almost any appropriate shape, and retained the tradition of bootmaking by hand. Where leather joined <b>to</b> leather, he <b>skived,</b> or thinned, both pieces to obtain a smoother, less abrasive seam, one that not only felt better to the wearer but also retained the lines of the boot. To provide support for the foot of the boot, Charlie used only iron spikes pounded flat by his hammer of 70+ years on his anvil affixed to a tree stump. For small men and women, he used a 40-penny spike; for larger men, he used a 60-penny spike, about six inches long and half-inch wide, known as a [...] "bridge timber spike." [...] And [...] "The sole has got to be leather and got to be thick leather," [...] and that's the way it was, for Charlie. These and other elements defined the Charlie Dunn [...] "code" [...] of making boots that had passed through the centuries of bootmaking, refined in his hands and on shop machines nearly as old as he was.|$|R

5000|$|Langer {{grew up in}} {{the town}} of Skive, Denmark. His parents are both {{teachers}} and share a love for music. At age three, he started learning the piano [...] and he listened to his father's record collection. When he was 15, he dreamt of moving to New York and becoming a rock star. In high school, he was in a Rage Against the Machine cover band. After finishing high school, a local audition in Skive got him in touch with a talent scout who suggested him to move to Copenhagen and present his homemade demos there. He studied jazz piano at the Royal Danish Academy of Music, but eventually he just started writing music It was during this time he started playing guitar. Ultimately this landed him a record deal with Copenhagen Records. Langer debuted on 20 March 2006 in Denmark with Attention Please, an album containing potent pop rock songs. It was scheduled to be released a year earlier, but in post-production he connected so well with Søren Balsner of Carpark North that Langer requested his label to scrap the recordings and start over with Balsner as producer. Despite an intense media hype and good reviews, the album had limited success in Denmark. According to Langer, his record label is to blame for raising unrealistic expectations: [...] "As it often happens, when something is overhyped, then the media just gives you the finger afterwards when it comes out. Because of course this record isn't a masterpiece, but I think it's a very good debut for a very young guy, but that's never where we came to because they had been told that it was a masterpiece from the record label. So the minute it came out, it flopped." [...] The song [...] "Breaking News" [...] became a hit. The American spotter Sat Bisla picked up on him, which enabled Langer to perform in Great Britain and Germany, to move to New York City and from there often travel back and forth to Los Angeles, where he among others played before record company executives. This media circus life was taxing on him at such a young age, he had grown tired of other people's visions on his career, questioned his talent and got homesick, so in 2007 he quit his rock star life and returned <b>to</b> <b>Skive.</b> Equipped with only a map and his guitar, he roamed through Europe like a troubadour, playing about 100 acoustic shows (other sources say about 60) for gas money to fuel his [...] Volkswagen Polo which he bought after his return. He lived off the money he collected by selling his CDs after each show. The tour helped him to find himself again and garnered him a growing fanbase. Later in 2007, he composed and conducted the Danish performance of Hedwig and the Angry Inch at the Nørrebros Theater in Copenhagen starring Anders W. Berthelsen.|$|E
30|$|The frozed grid {{was loaded}} onto a home-made cryo-shuttle (Zhang et al. 2016) and then {{transferred}} {{into the chamber}} of a dual beam scanning electron microscope (FEI Helios NanoLab 600 i) that {{is equipped with a}} Quorum PT 3000 cryo-stage. The grid has been pre-tilted 45 ° on the shuttle. Then the grid was imaged and examined using electron beam and the signal from secondary electron with the following experimental parameters, an accelerating voltage of 2  kV, a beam current of 0.34  nA, and a dwell time of 3  µs. The region of interest (ROI) with crystals was identified and marked. Then focused ion gallium beam was utilized to perform fabrication of crystals. Before cryo-FIB milling, a thin layer of Pt was coated using GIS system to reduce the radiation damage during milling. The inclination angle of the beam was kept[*]~ 10 ° against the grid plane. The accelerating voltage of ion beam was 30  kV. Considering the block shape of the crystal, a large beam current of 0.43  nA was used <b>to</b> <b>skive</b> crystals efficiently. When a thick slice of lamella was made, the beam current was reduced to 80  pA for the fine trimming and also the reduction of potential radiation damage. The final thickness of the crystal cryo-lamella was controlled ~ 300  nm. Several crystal cryo-lamellas can be made in one grid. After cryo-FIB fabrication, the grid was transferred and kept in liquid nitrogen for the subsequent MicroED experiment.|$|E
