5|$|Colin Renfrew {{has pointed}} out the dangers of {{applying}} modern values of art to past societies and cultures. Günter Berghaus argues that these works have often been approached {{with a set of}} post-Renaissance aesthetic values that distinguish between artists and craftsman and art and artifact, although these categories are not universal and may be inappropriate for understanding prehistoric society. Duncan Garrow has pointed to the difficulties of the modern distinction drawn between form and decoration. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> studies of prehistoric art tend to be placed on decoration in objects such as ceramics and ignores the importance of form, found in objects such as weapons.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> {{this system}} is on {{understanding}} the three marks of existence, dukkha, anatta and anicca. This emphasis is recognizable in the value that is given to vipassanā over samatha, especially in the contemporary Vipassana movement.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally Xing Yi was {{an armed}} art. Students would train {{initially}} with the spear, progressing to shorter weapons and eventually empty-handed fighting. This gradually changed throughout the 20th century, as <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> most traditional Chinese Martial Arts {{shifted from the}} use of weapons to fighting empty-handed. Weapon diversity is great in many lineages, with the idea being that an experienced Xing Yi fighter would be able to pick up almost any weapon available (or an object to use as such) irrespective of its exact length, weight and shape.|$|E

25|$|Until the Czech coup, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> Washington {{had been}} on {{economic}} containment of Communism, primarily through the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan and a heavy reliance on atomic power as a shield to support it. President Harry S. Truman understood that in 1946 and 1947 the American people were not prepared for a massive conventional arms buildup or a confrontation with the Soviet Union. He was reluctant to increase the military budget dramatically and instead chose a gradual and balanced buildup. Expecting to spend large amounts on the Marshall Plan, he sought to keep the annual defence budget below $15billion.|$|E
25|$|The Gazelle was {{designed}} to be easy to maintain, all bearings were life-rated without need for continuous application of lubrication and most fluid reservoirs to be rapidly inspected. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> the design stage of achieving minimal maintenance requirements contributed towards the helicopter's low running costs; many of the components were designed to have a service life in excess of 700 flying hours, and in some cases 1,200 flight hours, before requiring replacement. Due to the performance of many of the Gazelle's subsystems, features pioneered upon the Gazelle such as the fenestron would appear upon later Aerospatiale designs.|$|E
25|$|E. B. Ford was an {{experimental}} naturalist {{who wanted to}} test natural selection in nature, virtually inventing the field of ecological genetics. His work on natural selection in wild populations of butterflies and moths {{was the first to}} show that predictions made by R. A. Fisher were correct. In 1940, {{he was the first to}} describe and define genetic polymorphism, and to predict that human blood group polymorphisms might be maintained in the population by providing some protection against disease. His 1949 book Mendelism and Evolution, helped to persuade Dobzhansky to change <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> the third edition of his famous text from drift to selection.|$|E

25|$|As of 2012, India has 152 central universities, 316 state universities, and 191 private universities. Other {{institutions}} include 33,623 colleges, including 1,800 exclusive women's colleges, functioning {{under these}} universities and institutions, and 12,748 Institutions offering Diploma Courses. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> the tertiary {{level of education}} lies on science and technology. Indian educational institutions by 2004 consisted {{of a large number}} of technology institutes. Distance learning is also a feature of the Indian higher education system. The Government has launched Rashtriya Uchchattar Shiksha Abhiyan to provide strategic funding to State higher and technical institutions. A total of 316 state public universities and 13,024 colleges will be covered under it.|$|E
25|$|The second {{goal is to}} have {{safe and}} {{reliable}} production in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> this project is on local food production to reduce food mileage. Local agriculture produces mostly rice, mandarins and local salad onions. After the Minamata disease scandal local farmers wanted to show that their products were safe, so they changed their way of production by: not using pesticides anymore, use 70% less fertilizer and instead started using a special fertilizer from Chisso. In the 2011 environmental report the local production was stable for the last 10 years and the advice was to promote local production. Fishing was not possible from 1970 till 1997, because the bay was closed with a net to prevent the catching of contaminated fish. During this period fishers were compensated by the local government. When the nets were removed sardine catching started to flourish and there now are full-time and part-time fishers, who combine fishing with other jobs.|$|E
25|$|Vocal {{music is}} music {{performed}} {{by one or}} more singers, which are typically called songs, and which may be performed with or without instrumental accompaniment, in which singing provides the main focus of the piece. Vocal music is probably the oldest form of music since it does not require any instrument or equipment besides the voice. All musical cultures have some form of vocal music and there are many long-standing singing traditions throughout the world's cultures.Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered as instrumental music. For example, some blues rock songs may have a short, simple call-and-response chorus, but <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> the song is on the instrumental melodies and improvisation. Vocal music typically features sung words called lyrics, although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables or noises, sometimes as musical onomatopoeia. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a song, although, in classical music, terms such as aria are typically used.|$|E

25|$|Compulsory figures {{formerly}} {{accounted for}} up to 60% of the score in singles figure skating, which meant that skaters who could build up a big lead in figures could win competitions {{even if they were}} mediocre free skaters. As television coverage of skating events became more important, so did free skating. Beginning in 1968, the ISU began to progressively reduce the weight of figures and introduced the short program in 1973. With these changes, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> competitive figure skating shifted to increasing athleticism. By the 1980s, some skaters began practicing quadruple jumps. Jozef Sabovcik of Czechoslovakia landed a quad toe loop at the 1986 European Championships which was recognized at the event but then ruled invalid three weeks later due to a touchdown with his free foot. At the 1988 World Championships, Kurt Browning of Canada landed the first quad toe loop which has remained ratified. Although it was expected that quads would soon become an important part of men's skating, it was a number of years before this happened. Japan's Midori Ito landed the first triple axel by a woman. Worth only 20% by 1989, figures were eliminated entirely from international competition in 1990.|$|E
500|$|The Chicago program {{comprised}} sequences in {{the natural}} sciences, the humanities, {{and the social sciences}} which were supposed to integrate past and present work within these divisions of knowledge. In addition, these sequences were capped by work in philosophy and history. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> teaching was on small classes with bright students, where discussion could supplant monologue as the dominant pedagogic technique.... At the same time, in order to retain high academic standards and contact with the [...] "frontiers of knowledge", the College's pedagogy emphasized reading originals (sometimes although not invariably, defined as Great Books).|$|E
500|$|During the 17th century, horses from Perche, the {{ancestors}} of the current Percheron, were smaller, standing between [...] high, and more agile. These horses were almost uniformly gray; paintings and drawings from the Middle Ages generally show French knights on mounts of this color. After {{the days of the}} armored knight, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> horse breeding was shifted so as to develop horses better able to pull heavy stage coaches at a fast trot. Gray horses were preferred because their light coloring was more visible at night. This new type of horse was called the [...] "Diligence Horse", because the stage coaches they pulled were named [...] "diligences". After the stage coach was replaced by rail, the modern Percheron type arose as a slightly heavier horse for use in agriculture and heavy hauling work moving goods from docks to railway terminals.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{have seen}} Jake as an {{ambiguous}} representative of Hemingway manliness. For example, {{in the bar}} scene in Paris, Jake is angry at some homosexual men. The critic Ira Elliot suggests that Hemingway viewed homosexuality as an inauthentic way of life, and that he aligns Jake with homosexual men because, like them, Jake does not have sex with women. Jake's anger shows his self-hatred at his inauthenticity and lack of masculinity. His sense of masculine identity is lost—he {{is less than a}} man. Elliot wonders if Jake's wound perhaps signifies latent homosexuality, rather than only a loss of masculinity; <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> the novel, however, is on Jake's interest in women. Hemingway's writing has been called homophobic because of the language his characters use. For example, in the fishing scenes, Bill confesses his fondness for Jake but then goes on to say, [...] "I couldn't tell you that in New York. It'd mean I was a faggot." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewer Margaret Busby, who {{saw this}} book [...] "not so much an ending as a beginning", called Song [...] "the {{culmination}} of a unique autobiographical achievement, a glorious celebration of indomitable spirit". [...] Like other reviewers, Busby considered Song a series of [...] "beautifully crafted vignettes" [...] and found the book concise and readable. [...] Scholar John McWhorter {{did not look at}} Angelou's use of vignettes as positively, and stated that all of her books were short, divided into [...] "ever shorter" [...] chapters as her series progressed, and [...] "sometimes seem written for children rather than adults". [...] McWhorter recognized, however, that Angelou's precise prose and [...] "striking and even jarring simplicity" [...] was due to Angelou's purposes of depicting African-American culture in a positive way. [...] Busby also recognized Angelou's ability to find inspirational lessons from adversity, both nationally and personally, although <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> this book was on the personal, especially her dilemmas as a mother and as a lover.|$|E
500|$|After the American Civil War, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> American racing {{changed from}} the older style of four-mile (6km) races in which the horses ran {{in at least two}} heats. The new style of racing {{involved}} shorter races not run in heats, over distances from five furlongs up to [...] This development meant a change in breeding practices, as well as the age that horses were raced, with younger horses and sprinters coming to the fore. It was also after the Civil War that the American Thoroughbred returned to England to race. Iroquois became the first American-bred winner of the Epsom Derby in 1881. The success of American-bred Thoroughbreds in England led to the Jersey Act in 1913, which limited the importation of American Thoroughbreds into England. After World War I, the breeders in America continued to emphasize speed and early racing age but also imported horses from England, and this trend continued past World War II. After World War II, Thoroughbred breeding remained centered in Kentucky, but California, New York, and Florida also emerged as important racing and breeding centers.|$|E
50|$|Although some sex-positive feminists, such as Betty Dodson, {{were active}} in the early 1970s, much of sex-positive {{feminism}} largely {{began in the late}} 1970s and 1980s as a response to <b>the</b> increasing <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> radical feminism on anti-pornography activism.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{approaches}} to reading presume that students learn differently. <b>The</b> phonics <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> reading draws heavily from behaviorist learning theory that {{is associated with}} the work of the Harvard psychologist B.F.

5000|$|In {{ecological}} usage, {{the word}} was coined by the entomologist Auguste-Henri Forel as an analogue to [...] "symbiosis", also {{in the sense of}} [...] "next to". However, <b>in</b> this case, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> was <b>in</b> contrast to [...] "together" [...] ("sym-").|$|R
500|$|The {{theme of}} women and death is evident in stories as early as [...] "Indian Camp". The theme of death {{permeates}} Hemingway's work. Young believes <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> [...] "Indian Camp" [...] {{was not so much}} on the woman who gives birth or the father who commits suicide, but on Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a [...] "badly scarred and nervous young man". Hemingway sets the events in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] that shape the Adams persona. Young believes [...] "Indian Camp" [...] holds the [...] "master key" [...] to [...] "what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career". Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in existentialism: if [...] "nothingness" [...] is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life. Francis Macomber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic; the bullfighter in the corrida represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity. In his paper The Uses of Authenticity: Hemingway and the Literary Field, Timo Müller writes that Hemingway's fiction is successful because the characters live an [...] "authentic life", and the [...] "soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature".|$|E
