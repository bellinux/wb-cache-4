5|$|Carthage, {{the second}} largest city in <b>the</b> <b>empire,</b> was lost along with much of North Africa in 439 AD to the Vandals, {{and the fate of}} Rome seemed sealed. By 476 AD, what {{remained}} of <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> was completely in the hands of federated Germanic troops and when they revolted, led by Odoacer and deposed the Emperor Romulus Augustus there was nobody to stop them. Odoacer happened to hold the part of <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> around Italy and Rome but other parts of <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> were ruled by Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Franks, Alans and others. <b>The</b> <b>Empire</b> in the West had fallen, and its remnant in Italy was no longer Roman in nature.

5|$|A {{period of}} {{increasing}} trouble and decline {{began with the}} reign of Commodus. Commodus' assassination in 192 triggered the Year of the Five Emperors, of which Septimius Severus emerged victorious. The assassination of Alexander Severus in 235 led to the Crisis of the Third Century in which 26 men were declared emperor by the Roman Senate over a fifty-year time span. It {{was not until the}} reign of Diocletian that <b>the</b> <b>empire</b> was fully stabilized with the introduction of the Tetrarchy, which saw four emperors rule <b>the</b> <b>empire</b> at once. This arrangement was ultimately unsuccessful, leading to a civil war that was finally ended by Constantine the Great, who defeated his rivals and became the sole ruler of <b>the</b> <b>empire</b> in 324. Constantine subsequently established a second capital city in Byzantium, which he renamed Constantinople. It remained the capital of the east until its demise. Constantine also adopted Christianity which later became the official state religion of <b>the</b> <b>empire.</b> Following the death of Theodosius I in 395, <b>the</b> <b>empire</b> was permanently divided between the West and the East. The dominion of the Western Roman Empire was gradually eroded by abuses of power, civil wars, barbarian migrations and invasions, military reforms and economic depression. The Sack of Rome in 410 by the Visigoths and again in 455 by the Vandals accelerated the Western Empire's decay, while the deposition of the emperor, Romulus Augustulus, in 476 by Odoacer, is generally accepted to mark the end of <b>the</b> <b>empire</b> in the west. However, Augustulus was never recognized by his Eastern colleague, and separate rule in the Western part of <b>the</b> <b>empire</b> only ceased to exist upon the death of Julius Nepos, in 480. The Eastern Roman Empire (in modern historiography called the Byzantine Empire) endured for another millennium as one of the leading powers in the world alongside its arch-rival the Sassanid Empire, which had inherited a centuries-old Roman-Persian conflict from its predecessor the Parthians. It eventually fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.|$|E

5000|$|The {{settlement}} {{dates to the}} Iron Age: according to the Soviet Encyclopedia it was established {{during the reign of}} the Urartian king Menua (r. 810 - 785 BC). The Armenian name Manazkert is supposedly shortened from Manavazkert (Մանավազկերտ), adopted in Greek as Μαντζικέρτ.The suffix -kert is frequently found in Armenian toponymy, meaning [...] "built by". According to Movses Khorenatsi, Manzikert was founded by Manaz, one of the sons of Hayk, the legendary and eponymous patriarch and progenitor of the Armenians.

When the Returners arrive in the capital, they find Emperor Gestahl claiming to no longer have the will to fight, inviting the Returners to a banquet to negotiate peace.

5|$|Although such a {{long-range}} {{attack on a}} state far from the centre of <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> may seem extraordinary (the last time <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> had attempted anything on this scale was the failed invasion of Sicily over one hundred and twenty years earlier), it can be {{explained in terms of}} Manuel's foreign policy, which was to use the Latins to ensure the survival of <b>the</b> <b>Empire.</b> This focus on the bigger picture of the eastern Mediterranean and even further afield thus led Manuel to intervene in Egypt: it was believed that {{in the context of the}} wider struggle between the crusader states and the Islamic powers of the east, control of Egypt would be the deciding factor. It had become clear that the ailing Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt held the key to the fate of the crusader states. If Egypt came out of its isolation and joined forces with the Muslims under Nur ad-Din, the crusader cause was in trouble.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the crisis}} of the 3rd century was not the {{absolute}} beginning of Rome's decline, it nevertheless did impose a severe strain on <b>the</b> <b>empire</b> as Romans waged war on one another as they had not done since {{the last days of the}} Republic. Within the space of a single century, twenty-seven military officers declared themselves emperors and reigned over parts of <b>the</b> <b>empire</b> for months or days, all but two meeting with a violent end. The time was characterized by a Roman army that was as likely to be attacking itself as it was an outside invader, reaching a low point around 258 AD. Ironically, while it was these usurpations that led to the breakup of <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> during the crisis, it was the strength of several frontier generals that helped reunify <b>the</b> <b>empire</b> through force of arms.|$|E

50|$|In 1853 <b>the</b> Russian <b>Empire</b> {{on behalf}} of the Slavic Balkan states began to {{question}} the very existence of <b>the</b> Ottoman <b>Empire.</b> <b>The</b> result was the Crimean War, 1853-1856, in which <b>the</b> British <b>Empire</b> and <b>the</b> French <b>Empire</b> supported <b>the</b> Ottoman <b>Empire</b> in its struggle against the incursions of <b>the</b> Russian <b>Empire.</b> Eventually, <b>the</b> Ottoman <b>Empire</b> lost control of the Balkan region.|$|R
5|$|Another {{division}} among Christians occurred, when Leo III {{ordered the}} destruction of icons throughout <b>the</b> <b>Empire.</b> This led to a significant religious crisis, which ended in mid-9th century with the restoration of icons.

5|$|Byzantium looked {{impressive}} when Manuel died in 1180, {{having just}} celebrated the betrothal {{of his son}} Alexios II to {{the daughter of the}} king of France. Thanks to the diplomacy and campaigning of Alexios, John, and Manuel, <b>the</b> <b>empire</b> was a great power, economically prosperous, and secure on its frontiers; but there were serious problems as well. Internally, the Byzantine court required a strong leader to hold it together, and after Manuel's death stability was seriously endangered from within. Some of the foreign enemies of <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> were lurking on the flanks, waiting for a chance to attack, in particular the Turks in Anatolia, whom Manuel had ultimately failed to defeat, and the Normans in Sicily, who had already tried but failed to invade <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> on several occasions. Even the Venetians, the single most important western ally of Byzantium, were on bad terms with <b>the</b> <b>empire</b> at Manuel's death in 1180. Given this situation, it would have taken a strong Emperor to secure <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> against the foreign threats it now faced, and to rebuild the depleted Imperial Treasury. But Manuel's son was a minor, and his unpopular regency government was overthrown in a violent coup d'état. This troubled succession weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely.|$|E
50|$|In the Migration Period and the Middle Ages, {{the region}} was part of <b>the</b> Eastern Roman <b>Empire,</b> <b>the</b> Hunnic <b>Empire,</b> <b>the</b> Ostrogothic Kingdom, the Kingdom of the Gepids, the Lombard State, the Avar Khaganate, <b>the</b> Frankish <b>Empire,</b> <b>the</b> Bulgarian <b>Empire,</b> <b>the</b> Principality of Pannonian Croatia, the Principality of Lower Pannonia, the Great Moravia, and the Kingdom of Hungary.|$|R
5000|$|Sultan Abdul-Hamid II, {{who ruled}} 1876-1909, felt that <b>the</b> <b>Empire's</b> desperate {{situation}} {{could only be}} remedied through strong and determined leadership.

5|$|Diocletian divided <b>the</b> <b>empire</b> {{into four}} regions, each {{ruled by a}} {{separate}} emperor, the Tetrarchy. Confident that he fixed the disorders that were plaguing Rome, he abdicated along with his co-emperor, and the Tetrarchy soon collapsed.
