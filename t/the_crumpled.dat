25|$|The oldest known {{amate paper}} {{dates back to}} 75 CE. It was {{discovered}} {{at the site of}} Huitzilapa, Jalisco. Huitzilapa is a shaft tomb culture site located northwest of Tequila Volcano near the town of Magdalena. <b>The</b> <b>crumpled</b> piece of paper was found in the southern chamber of the site's shaft tomb, possibly associated with a male scribe. Rather than being produced from Trema micrantha, from which modern amate is made, the amate found at Huitzilapa is made from Ficus tecolutensis. Iconography (in stone) dating from the period contains depictions of items thought to be paper. For example, Monument 52 from the Olmec site of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán illustrates an individual adorned with ear pennants of folded paper. The oldest known surviving book made from amate paper may be the Grolier Codex, which Michael D. Coe and other researchers have asserted is authentic and dated to the 12th-13th century CE.|$|E

His work at the Tribune came as his fame as a poet was reaching its peak, and one colleague described it as [...] "a liberal education in the delights of intellectual life to sit in intimate companionship with John Hay and watch the play of that well-stored and brilliant mind".

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the properties of}} crystalline phantom membranes, at <b>the</b> <b>crumpling</b> transition and in the flat phase, using a nonperturbative renormalization group approach. We avoid a derivative expansion of the effective average action and instead analyse the full momentum dependence of the elastic coupling functions. This leads to a more accurate determination of the critical exponents and further yields the full momentum dependence of the correlation functions of the in-plane and out-of-plane fluctuation. The flow equations are solved numerically for D= 2 dimensional membranes embedded in a d= 3 dimensional space. Within our approach we find a crumpling transition of second order which is characterized by an anomalous exponent η_c≈ 0. 63 (8) and the thermal exponent ν≈ 0. 69. Near <b>the</b> <b>crumpling</b> transition <b>the</b> order parameter of the flat phase vanishes with a critical exponent β≈ 0. 22. The flat phase anomalous dimension is η_f≈ 0. 85 and the Poisson's ratio inside the flat phase {{is found to be}} σ_f≈ - 1 / 3. At <b>the</b> <b>crumpling</b> transition we find a much larger negative value of the Poisson's ratio σ_c ≈ - 0. 71 (5). We discuss further in detail the different regimes of the momentum dependent fluctuations, both in the flat phase and in the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>crumpling</b> transition, and extract the crossover momentum scales which separate them.

40|$|Abstract: Recently, {{pedestrian}} protection related research topics have been actively studied by automotive designers and engineers {{due to the}} enhanced pedestrian protecting regulations. It is required to design an energy absorbing structure, such as crumple zone that can sufficiently absorb the impact energy to reduce the leg injury when accident happens. The structure is designed by reducing the height of front end module, considering the mounting location, and investigating impact characteristics. In this paper, the concept of <b>the</b> <b>crumple</b> zone was introduced {{and the role of}} <b>the</b> <b>crumple</b> zone was investigated by analyzing the performance of upper legform impact to a bonnet leading edge test, and the design process was suggested...|$|R
50|$|When {{a vehicle}} is {{hit on the}} side by another vehicle, <b>the</b> <b>crumple</b> zones of <b>the</b> {{striking}} vehicle will absorb some of the kinetic energy of <b>the</b> collision. <b>The</b> <b>crumple</b> zones of <b>the</b> struck vehicle may also absorb some of the collision's energy, particularly if the vehicle is not struck on its passenger compartment. Both vehicles are frequently turned from their original directions of travel. If the collision is severe, the struck vehicle may be spun or rolled over, potentially causing it to strike other vehicles, objects, or pedestrians. After the collision, the involved vehicles may be stuck together by the folding of their parts around each other.|$|R

40|$|Insight in <b>the</b> <b>crumpling</b> or {{compaction}} of one-dimensional objects is {{of great}} importance for understanding biopolymer packaging and designing innovative technological devices. By compacting various types of wires in rigid confinements and characterizing the morphology of <b>the</b> resulting <b>crumpled</b> structures, here we report how friction, plasticity, and torsion enhance disorder, leading to a transition from coiled to folded morphologies. In the latter case, where folding dominates <b>the</b> <b>crumpling</b> process, we find that reducing the relative wire thickness counter-intuitively causes the maximum packing density to decrease. The segment-size distribution gradually becomes more asymmetric during compaction, reflecting an increase of spatial correlations. We introduce a self-avoiding random walk model and verify that the cumulative injected wire length follows a universal dependence on segment size, allowing for the prediction of the efficiency of compaction {{as a function of}} material properties, container size, and injection force.
