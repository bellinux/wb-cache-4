5|$|Hawaiian eruptions are {{responsible}} for several unique volcanological objects. Small volcanic particles are carried and formed by the wind, chilling quickly into teardrop-shaped glassy fragments known as Pele's tears (after Pele, the Hawaiian volcano deity). During especially high winds these chunks may even {{take the form of}} long drawn-out strands, known as Pele's hair. Sometimes basalt aerates into reticulite, the lowest density rock <b>type</b> <b>on</b> earth.|$|E
5|$|Flow-dominated eruptions are {{long-lived}} {{events that}} build up extensive, compound lava flows. The extent of these flows makes them a major terrain <b>type</b> <b>on</b> Io. In {{this style of}} eruption, magma emerges onto the surface from vents {{on the floor of}} paterae, vents surrounding paterae, or from fissures on the plains, producing inflated, compound lava flows similar to those seen at Kīlauea in Hawaii. Images from the Galileo spacecraft revealed that many of Io's major flows, like those at Prometheus and Amirani, are produced by the build-up of small breakouts of lava on top of older flows. Flow-dominated eruptions differ from explosion-dominated eruptions by their longevity and their lower energy output per unit of time. Lava erupts at a generally steady rate, and flow-dominated eruptions can last for years or decades.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, British Airways, Iberia, and Icelandair {{were the}} 757's largest {{mainline}} customers, while other carriers such as Lufthansa rejected the type as {{too large for}} their narrow-body aircraft needs. Many European charter airlines, including Air 2000, Air Holland, and LTU International, also acquired the twinjet for holiday and tour package flights in the late 1980s. In Asia, where even larger aircraft were commonly preferred because of greater passenger volumes, the 757 found fewer orders. A 1982 sales demonstration was unable to attract a purchase from potential customer Japan Airlines, and the first Asian customer, Singapore Airlines, sold its four 757s in 1989 in favor of standardizing on the 240-seat wide-body Airbus A310, just five years after debuting the <b>type</b> <b>on</b> Indonesian and Malaysian routes. The 757 fared better in China, where following an initial purchase by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) in 1987, orders grew to 59 aircraft, making it the largest Asian market. Operators such as China Southern, China Southwest, Shanghai Airlines, Xiamen Airlines, and Xinjiang Airlines used the 757 on medium length domestic routes.|$|E

5|$|The Hotel Victoria {{opened in}} 1887, its name commemorating the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria held that year. It held 500 {{bedrooms}} {{and was the}} second largest hotel in London of its <b>type</b> <b>on</b> opening, overrunning its budget by around £520,000 (now £). The hotel was self-powered, generating its own electricity from dynamos. It was bought by Frederick Gordon in 1893, giving him a monopoly on all hotels on Northumberland Avenue. A refurbishment was started in 1911, though delayed due to the First World War, {{which resulted in a}} new annexe, the Edward VII Rooms. It closed in 1940 and was used by the War Office in need of extra accommodation. The War Office bought the building outright in 1951, renaming it the Victoria Buildings. It was subsequently renamed Northumberland House.|$|E
5|$|The Nclass {{was also}} {{successful}} on the Central section, where they worked alongside L. B. Billinton's LB K class 2-6-0s. However the large cylinder and cab sizes of the Nclass prevented {{use of the}} <b>type</b> <b>on</b> the Eastern section's TonbridgeHastings line. The route's narrow bridges and tunnels were unable to accommodate the class, and provided justification for using the narrower 3-cylinder N1 class 2-6-0 on the route. Despite these restrictions, the class was capable of hauling heavy loads at moderate speeds, a useful attribute that was exploited throughout the Second World War. The entire class came into British Railways' ownership in 1948 and {{could be seen in}} most areas of the Southern Region.|$|E
5|$|The last Sabre {{conversion}} {{course was}} completed in December 1970. Early the following year, the Australian government announced that the Sabres were to be phased out and retired by July 1971. At this time RAAF fighter pilots were trained progressively on the CAC Winjeel, Macchi, Sabre and Mirage, but after considering the feasibility of direct Macchi-to-Mirage conversion, and the impracticability of maintaining the ageing Sabres, the government determined {{that it was possible}} to remove the Sabre from the process and retire the <b>type,</b> <b>on</b> the proviso that more Mirage trainers were made available; it subsequently approved the purchase of six new Mirage IIID dual trainers to augment the ten already in service. No.5 OTU was disbanded on 31July 1971, the date the Sabre was retired from RAAF service. The unit's Macchis were transferred back to No.2 OCU.|$|E

5|$|The {{quality of}} the {{original}} design was such that No. A866 was put {{on display at the}} British Empire Exhibition at Wembley from May to November 1925, and no class-wide modifications were made until 1934. This was when the SECR and Woolwich batches began to receive new domes and front footsteps during overhauls and general repairs. These were the same design as those used on Nos.14001414, and were intended to standardise components between the batches. The SECR and Woolwich batches also received smoke deflectors to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring the driver's vision ahead. The U1 chimneys replaced the standard Nclass <b>type</b> <b>on</b> the earlier locomotives, which, along with the removal of the piston tail rods on the earlier batches, created a truly standardised appearance.|$|E
5|$|Wilcke claimed two {{victories}} on 24 November 1942, an Il-2 Sturmovik and a Yak-1, {{his first}} victories {{in support of}} the Stalingrad pocket. On 30 November he claimed the destruction of three aircraft of unknown type, one more on 2 December, and three more on 8 December. Four victories claimed on 12 December, one Lavochkin La-5 and three Yak-1s, took his total to 148 aerial victories. Wilcke became the fourth German fighter pilot to achieve 150 aerial victories in combat. He achieved this mark on 17 December 1942, claiming victories 149–151. The next day he claimed victory over three more aircraft. Following this 154th victory, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords on 23 December 1943, the 23rd member of the Wehrmacht to be so honored. Along with the Swords came the ban from flying further operational combat missions. Although banned from flying, he was credited with two more victories on the Eastern Front, a Yak-1 on 28 December and an aircraft of unknown <b>type</b> <b>on</b> 5 January 1943.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan did {{not take}} to his new posting and was eager {{to get back to}} the action. MacLachlan volunteered for service with RAF Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain which had begun in July 1940. He learned on the 18 August that he had been one of five pilots chosen from 88 Squadron to retrain as fighter pilots. He was posted to RAF Drem for {{training}} with No. 145 Squadron. He flew a Hawker Hurricane fighter for the first time days later on 22 August. Within nine days he had logged 18 hours in the <b>type.</b> <b>On</b> 3 September he was given official leave to travel to London. There he received his DFC at Buckingham Palace. He returned to No. 145 shortly afterwards and was based at RAF Tangmere, Croydon and Westhampnett. No. 11 Group RAF was in the thick of the fighting and suffered many casualties. MacLachlan and his group were to replace the many pilots killed or wounded. MacLachlan practiced operational take-offs, fighter tactics, radio control, break-aways and dogfights—the essence of air-to-air combat. He was sent on patrols on 30 August, but only over Scotland, to guard against attacks from Luftflotte 5 (Air Fleet 5) based in Norway. No interceptions were made as air combat was rare in the north. On 21 September MacLachlan survived a force-landing at Dyce, caused by an oil leak. On 27 September 1940 MacLachlan was posted to the south at Debden, arriving two days later. He was then assigned to No. 73 Squadron RAF at RAF Castle Camps.|$|E

5|$|The American Air Museum {{was opened}} by Queen Elizabeth II on 1 August 1997. The {{total cost of}} the project had been £13.5 million. The museum was re-dedicated on 27 September 2002, in a {{ceremony}} attended by former President George H. W. Bush and by Prince Charles. Since being opened, the museum has had its glass front removed, and then reinstalled, to allow the bringing-in of an SR-71 Blackbird and Consolidated B-24 Liberator. The SR-71, serial number 61-7962, is the only example of its <b>type</b> <b>on</b> display outside the United States, and set a flight altitude record of 85,069 feet (25,929m) in July 1976. Besides the Blackbird, nineteen other American aircraft are on display. Notable examples include a C-47 Skytrain which flew with the 316th Troop Carrier Group and participated in three major Second World War airborne operations; the June 1944 Normandy landings, Operation Market Garden and Operation Varsity, the airborne crossing of the River Rhine in March 1945. The museum's B-29 flew during the Korean War as part of the 7th Bomb Wing; it is the only example in Europe and one of only two preserved in museums outside the United States. The B-52 flew 200 sorties during the Vietnam War as part of the 28th Bomb Wing. The General Dynamics F-111 on display flew 19 missions during the 1991 Gulf War as part of the 77th Fighter Squadron.|$|E
