40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the available results for Belgium of the European Union coordinated monitoring program (2004 / 665 EC) on Salmonella in layers in 2005, as well as the results of the monthly outbreak reports of Salmonella Enteritidis in humans in 2005 to identify a possible statistical significant trend in both populations. Materials and Methods: Separate descriptive statistics and univariate analysis were carried out and the parametric and/or non-parametric hypothesis tests were conducted. A <b>time</b> <b>cluster</b> analysis was performed for all Salmonella Enteritidis phage types (PTs) isolated. The proportions of each Salmonella Enteritidis PT in layers and in humans were compared and the monthly distribution of the most common PT, isolated in both populations, was evaluated. Results: The <b>time</b> <b>cluster</b> analysis revealed significant clusters during the months May and June for layers and May, July, August, and September for humans. PT 21, the most frequently isolated PT in both populations in 2005, seemed to be responsible of these significant clusters. PT 4 was the second most frequently isolated PT. No significant difference was found for the monthly trend evolution of both PT in both populations based on parametric and non-parametric methods. Discussion and Conclusion: A similar monthly trend of PT distribution in humans and layers during the year 2005 was observed. The <b>time</b> <b>cluster</b> analysis and the statistical significance testing confirmed these results. Moreover, the <b>time</b> <b>cluster</b> analysis showed significant clusters during the summer time and slightly delayed in time (humans after layers). These results suggest a common link between the prevalence of Salmonella Enteritidis in layers and the occurrence of the pathogen in humans. Phage typing was confirmed to be a useful tool for identifying temporal trends...|$|E

40|$|<b>Time</b> series <b>clustering</b> {{has become}} an {{important}} topic, particularly for similarity search amongst long time series such as those arising in bioinformatics. Unfortunately, existing methods for <b>time</b> series <b>clustering</b> that rely on the actual time series point values can become impractical since the methods do not scale well for longer time series, and many clustering algorithms do not easily handle high dimensional data. In this {{paper we propose a}} scalable method for <b>time</b> series <b>clustering</b> that replaces the time series point values with some global measures of the characteristics of the time series. These global measures are then clustered using a selforganising map, which performs additional dimension reduction. The proposed approach has been tested using some benchmark time series previously reported for <b>time</b> series <b>clustering,</b> and is shown to yield useful and robust clustering. The resulting clusters are similar to those produced by other methods, with some interesting variations that can be intuitively explained with knowledge of the global characteristics of the time series...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Sequential <b>time</b> series <b>clustering</b> is a {{technique}} used to extract important features from time series data. The method can {{be shown to be}} the process of clustering in the Delay-Vector space formalism used in the Dynamical systems literature. Recently, the startling claim was made that sequential <b>time</b> series <b>clustering</b> is meaningless. This has important consequences for a significant amount of work in the literature, since such a claim invalidates these work’s contribution. In this paper, we show that sequential <b>time</b> series <b>clustering</b> is not meaningless, and that the problem highlighted in these works stem from their use of the Euclidean distance metric as the distance measure in the delay vector space. As a solution, we consider quite a general class of time series, and propose a regime based on two types of similarity that can exist between delay vectors, which give rise naturally to an alternative distance measure to Euclidean distance in the delay vector space. We show that, using this alternative distance measure, sequential <b>time</b> series <b>clustering</b> can indeed be meaningful...|$|R

40|$|Objectives This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} and characterize homogeneous subgroups of individuals with distinct trajectories of physical functioning (PF) and to examine prognostic indicators of deterioration in PF in a highly heterogeneous population of older adults with joint pain and comorbidity. Study design A prospective cohort study among 407 older adults with joint pain and comorbidity provided data {{over a period of}} 18 months, with 6 month time-intervals. We used latent class growth modelling (LCGM) to identify underlying subgroups (clusters) with distinct trajectories of PF. Next, we characterized these subgroups and applied multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify prognostic indicators for deterioration in PF. Main outcome measures We measures PF with the RAND- 36 PF subscale and several potential sociodemographic, physical and psychosocial prognostic indicators. Results LCGM identified three clusters. Cluster 1 'good PF' contained 140 participants with good baseline PF and small improvements over <b>time.</b> <b>Cluster</b> 2 'moderate PF' contained 130 participants with moderate baseline PF and deterioration over <b>time.</b> <b>Cluster</b> 3 'poor PF' contained 137 participants with poor baseline PF and deterioration over time. After backward selection, the final model that could best distinguish between improved participants (cluster 1) and deteriorated participants (cluster 2 - 3) included the following prognostic indicators: higher age, more depressive symptoms, less perceived self-efficacy and more activity avoidance. Conclusions Older adults with joint pain and comorbidity either improved or deteriorated in PF over time. The prognostic model facilitates the classification of patients, the provision of more accurate information about prognosis and helps to narrow the focus to the high risk group of poor PF. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|E
