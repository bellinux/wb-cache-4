40|$|Purposes of {{this paper}} are to {{establish}} the model for explaining Japanese young's housing demand and to derive the implication to guide Japanese housing policy. For this, I investigate the determinants of their tenure choice, considering <b>their</b> <b>housing</b> independence from <b>their</b> parents. On the basis of Japanese features, I would rather regard <b>their</b> <b>housing</b> self-pay as <b>their</b> independence than regard their nest-leaving as <b>their</b> independence. Here, <b>housing</b> self-pay means people bear <b>their</b> <b>housing</b> cost by themselves. As a result, this paper finds the strong relationship between Japanese young's financial ability and <b>their</b> <b>housing</b> independence. Just as I thought, recent severe economic environment of Japanese young discourages them from entering housing market. This result also shows their complete dependent choice is an essential element for considering the magnitude of <b>their</b> <b>housing</b> demand. Furthermore, my findings validate Japanese housing policy of recent years. ...|$|R
