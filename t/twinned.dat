50|$|If several <b>twin</b> crystal {{parts are}} aligned {{by the same}} <b>twin</b> law they are {{referred}} to as multiple or repeated <b>twins.</b> If these multiple <b>twins</b> are aligned in parallel they are called polysynthetic <b>twins.</b> When the multiple <b>twins</b> are not parallel they are cyclic <b>twins.</b> Albite, calcite, and pyrite often show polysynthetic <b>twinning.</b> Closely spaced polysynthetic <b>twinning</b> is often observed as striations or fine parallel lines on the crystal face. Rutile, aragonite, cerussite, and chrysoberyl often exhibit cyclic <b>twinning,</b> typically in a radiating pattern.But in general based on relationship between <b>twin</b> axis and <b>twin</b> plane there are 3 types of <b>twinning</b> exists, such as;1-parallel twinning:-when <b>twin</b> axis and compositional plane lies parallel to each other.2-normal twin:-when the <b>twin</b> plane and compositional plane lies noramally.3-complex twin:-combination of parallel <b>twinning</b> and normal <b>twinning</b> on one compositional plane.|$|R
25|$|<b>Twinning</b> is the intergrowth {{of two or}} more crystal of {{a single}} mineral species. The {{geometry}} of the <b>twinning</b> is controlled by the mineral's symmetry. As a result, there are several types of <b>twins,</b> including contact <b>twins,</b> reticulated <b>twins,</b> geniculated <b>twins,</b> penetration <b>twins,</b> cyclic <b>twins,</b> and polysynthetic <b>twins.</b> Contact, or simple <b>twins,</b> consist of two crystals joined at a plane; this type of <b>twinning</b> is common in spinel. Reticulated <b>twins,</b> common in rutile, are interlocking crystals resembling netting. Geniculated <b>twins</b> have a bend in the middle that is caused by start of the <b>twin.</b> Penetration <b>twins</b> consist of two single crystals that have grown into each other; examples of this <b>twinning</b> include cross-shaped staurolite <b>twins</b> and Carlsbad <b>twinning</b> in orthoclase. Cyclic <b>twins</b> are caused by repeated <b>twinning</b> around a rotation axis. It occurs around three, four, five, six, or eight-fold axes, and the corresponding patterns are called threelings, fourlings, fivelings, sixlings, and eightlings. Sixlings are common in aragonite. Polysynthetic <b>twins</b> are similar to cyclic <b>twinning</b> by the presence of repetitive twinning; however, instead of occurring around a rotational axis, it occurs along parallel planes, usually on a microscopic scale.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe misorientations {{induced by}} {{cold-rolling}} in commercially pure titanium by <b>twinning</b> and multiple <b>twinning</b> were investigated by electron backscatter diffraction.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of twins: {{identical}} and fraternal. Identical <b>twins</b> have exactly the same genes; fraternal <b>twins</b> are no more similar than regular siblings.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} nano-indentation induced deformation <b>twinning</b> in pure magnesium. The working objectives {{of this study were}} to clarify: 1. Whether deformation <b>twinning</b> is a statistical certainty 2. The positive effects of high stress on deformation <b>twinning</b> 3. Whether deformation <b>twins</b> in magnesium are strain-rate sensitive 4. The role of grain and pre-existing <b>twin</b> boundaries on deformation <b>twinning</b> 5. The efficacy of the Schmid criterion (CRSS) in predicting deformation <b>twinning.</b> Deformation <b>twins</b> induced by nano-indentation using a Berkovich tip on magnesium grains were studied using a combination of optical microscopy, SEM and electron back scattering diffraction (EBSD). All nano-indents made on the magnesium grains in this study induced <b>twinning,</b> mainly of the 101 2 tension <b>twin</b> type. The <b>twins</b> induced were highly reproducible in terms of <b>twin</b> type, size, shape, amount and orientation with respect to the indent. Consistent with findings from other studies, deformation <b>twins</b> were found to react positively to increasing contact pressure. The evidence shows that <b>twin</b> nucleation and growth are both higher for indents made with higher stress. Moreover, deformation <b>twins</b> appear to be insensitive to strain-rate. Whilst pre-existing <b>twin</b> boundaries play no apparent role in promoting further <b>twinning,</b> grain boundaries <b>twins</b> were found to promote <b>twinning</b> in neighbouring grains. Finally, the <b>twin</b> variants formed by indenting in different crystal orientation suggested a break-down of the Schmid criterion, hence invalidates of the CRSS evaluation for deformation <b>twinning</b> in magnesium. These results elucidate existing knowledge gaps in this area...|$|R

50|$|A {{parasitic}} <b>twin</b> (also {{known as}} an asymmetrical or unequal conjoined <b>twin)</b> {{is the result of}} the processes that also produce vanishing <b>twins</b> and conjoined <b>twins,</b> and may represent a continuum between the two. Parasitic <b>twins</b> occur when a <b>twin</b> embryo begins developing in utero, but the pair does not fully separate, and one embryo maintains dominant development at the expense of its <b>twin.</b> Unlike conjoined <b>twins,</b> one ceases development during gestation and is vestigial to a mostly fully formed, otherwise healthy individual <b>twin.</b> The undeveloped <b>twin</b> is defined as parasitic, rather than conjoined, because it is incompletely formed or wholly dependent on the body functions of the complete fetus.The independent <b>twin</b> is called the autosite.|$|R

50|$|The exact {{development}} of craniopagus parasiticus {{is not well}} known.

When this happens, one embryo will dominate development, while the other's development is severely altered. The key difference between a parasitic <b>twin</b> and conjoined <b>twins</b> is that in parasitic <b>twins,</b> one <b>twin,</b> the parasite, stops development during gestation, whereas the other <b>twin,</b> the autosite, develops completely.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{formability}} of magnesium alloys at low temperatures, {{a thorough understanding of}} the <b>twinning</b> behaviour is required. Cylindrical samples were compressed uniaxially from room temperature to 250 o C, with the compression axis parallel to the transverse direction (TD) of a hot-rolled Mg- 3 Al- 1 Zn sheet. <b>Twinning</b> was investigated by use of orientation maps constructed from electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) data. Tensile <b>twinning</b> was observed at all temperatures. In some grains two <b>twin</b> variants were observed. For each <b>twin</b> the specific <b>twinning</b> variant among the 6 possible <b>twinning</b> systems was identified by consideration of the <b>twinning</b> rotation. The <b>twinning</b> was then investigated by comparing the specific <b>twin</b> variant with the calculated Schmid factors for all 6 possible <b>twin</b> variants. In cases of grains that are completely reoriented by two <b>twin</b> variants it is possible to back-calculate the initial grain orientation by considering all possible <b>twin</b> rotations for both of the <b>twin</b> variants. It was found that the operative <b>twin</b> variants where those with the highest Schmid factors...|$|R
40|$|We studied <b>twinning</b> and {{fertility}} indices in mothers with spontaneous monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) <b>twins</b> and in mothers who conceived their <b>twins</b> after {{the use of}} assisted reproduction techniques (ART). Participants in this study consisted of 8, 222 and 5, 505 women with spontaneous DZ and MZ offspring and 4, 164 and 250 women with ART DZ and MZ <b>twin</b> pairs, respectively. Women were compared {{with respect to the}} number of sibs and offspring, the presence of other relatives with <b>twins</b> and the time it took to conceive the <b>twins.</b> We also compared familial <b>twinning</b> between a younger and an older age group. Women with spontaneous DZ <b>twins</b> more often reported female relatives with <b>twins</b> than those with spontaneous MZ <b>twins.</b> The proportion of DZ versus MZ <b>twin</b> offspring in relatives was also larger in women with spontaneous DZ offspring than in women with MZ offspring. The first group of women reported a shorter time to conceive. Women with ART <b>twins</b> had fewer sibs and offspring and less often reported relatives with <b>twins.</b> We did not observe that DZ <b>twinning</b> was more familial in women who had their <b>twins</b> before age 36 years compared to older women.
