25|$|Dawkins {{interviews}} Haggard {{and begins}} by likening the worship experience to a Nuremberg Rally of which Goebbels {{might have been}} proud. Haggard says he knows nothing of the Nuremberg Rallies {{and goes on to}} say that some evangelicals <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> services as something akin to rock concerts. Haggard said the Bible is true and doesn't contradict itself as science does. Dawkins contends that the advantage of science is that new evidence changes ideas, allowing the advancement of human knowledge, something religion does not allow. Steadily the exchanges become increasingly fractious.|$|E
500|$|Nikkatsu was {{promoting}} lead actor Tamio Kawachi {{as one of}} its Bad Boy Trio, {{along with}} Akira Kobayashi and Tadao Sawamoto. Kurahara asked him to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> character as a [...] "hungry lion roaring at the sun." [...] He turned in what writer Mark Schilling described as his most unusual, and one of his best, performances of the period. Supporting actress Noriko Matsumoto came to the film as a relative unknown. Hiroyuki Nagato had starred in The Time of Youth. Eiji Go was the younger brother of future Diamond Line star Joe Shishido. The film was completed on August 18, 1960.|$|E
500|$|In mid-1910 Barrymore met socialite Katherine Corri Harris, and {{the couple}} married in September that year. Harris' father objected to the {{relationship}} and refused to attend the wedding. Shortly after the ceremony, The Dictator went on tour, and Harris was given a small role in the play. According to Peters, Barrymore [...] "began to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> marriage as a 'bus accident. Film critic Hollis Alpert wrote that, {{within a week of}} the wedding, Katherine was complaining that she saw her new husband too infrequently. Barrymore's increasing dependence on alcohol was also a cause of marital problems, and he explained that [...] "unhappiness increased the drink, and drink increased the unhappiness".|$|E

I have traced the {{family history of}} the man who calls himself Freddy Mike, and I find beyond question, and I may say even on his own admission, {{that there is not a}} shred or shadow of foundation for his story from beginning to end. He said that he had a twin brother. He had no twin brother. He said that the twin brother or a friend of the twin brother was in Eastbourne that night. There were no such people, and the whole story is an invention because, having known John Williams in the past, he did not like to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> being hanged." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1957, he {{was sent}} to the Imperial Defence College, London to attend a higher command course for one year. On his return, he was {{appointed}} the General Officer Commanding (GOC), 26th Infantry Division. While he commanded the division, General K. S. Thimayya was the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS), and Krishna Menon, the defence minister. During Menon's visit to Manekshaw's division, he asked him what he thought of his chief. Manekshaw replied that it was not appropriate for him to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chief in that way, and told Menon not to ask anybody again. This annoyed Menon and he told Manekshaw that if he wanted to, he could sack Thimayya, to which Manekshaw replied, [...] "You can get rid of him. But then I will get another." [...] This heated conversation with Menon later proved to be a thorn in his career.|$|E
500|$|Berry was {{religious}} {{as well as}} worldly, {{and collected}} relics as keenly as other types of objects. [...] By 1397 both of his sons had died, {{he was in his}} late fifties, and he had begun to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tomb, finally deciding to build a new [...] "Sainte Chapelle" [...] in his capital of Bourges to house it. [...] His collection of relics included objects claimed to be the wedding ring of the Virgin Mary, a cup used at the Wedding at Cana, a piece of the Burning Bush and many others. [...] However the provenance of the Holy Thorn, as well as its centrality to the Passion of Christ must have given it a special status. [...] The crown from which the thorn came had been bought in 1239 by Louis IX, both a saint and King of France, from the Latin Emperor in Constantinople, Baldwin II, along with a portion of the True Cross. [...] Both had been in Constantinople since the Muslim Conquest of the Holy Land in the 7th century, and may very well be the same relics that Bishop Paulinus of Nola saw in Jerusalem in 409. [...] There {{are a number of other}} thorn relics said to have come from the relic in the Paris Sainte Chapelle, including the far smaller Salting Reliquary in the British Museum, a French pendant of about 1340.|$|E

500|$|Though Hemmings did not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{work as a}} biography, Richard L. Hopkins (Comparative Education Review) said it {{essentially}} was strongest as one. Hopkins {{wrote in}} 1976 that Hemmings's book was the best biography of Neill available at the time, and called it [...] "comprehensive", [...] "objective", and [...] "sympathetically thoughtful". In comparison, Neill's autobiography [...] "rambles" [...] and Skidelsky's biography [...] "preens" [...] over [...] "small insights", while Hemmings unpacks larger issues to contextualize [...] "a complex man in a complex world". Reflecting on these three biographies of Neill, Hopkins added that Hemmings's book would interest [...] "comparative educators" [...] most, as that it addressed the two points readers would find most interesting about Neill: the role of his history on his ideas, {{and the role of}} his ideas in the outside world. Still, Hopkins thought many readers would find the work [...] "too long and detailed". Hopkins himself found Hemmings's book [...] "a struggle to work through", though more complete compared to Neill's [...] "easy", [...] "stream-of-consciousness" [...] prose. Leonard W. Cowie (British Journal of Educational Studies) said that Fifty Years was written with [...] "great competence" [...] and would be both [...] "interesting and essential" [...] for those interested in understanding Neill. [...] recommended the [...] "excellent volume" [...] for [...] "all readership levels", and considered it more telling than Neill's own autobiography. Shelley Neiderbach (Library Journal) agreed that Hemmings's [...] "admiring ... historical biography" [...] remained [...] "clear, cool, and evenhanded". [...] Sarah Curtis (The Times Literary Supplement) wrote in 1972 that Hemmings's account of Neill was [...] "the most lucid, dispassionate yet sympathetic" [...] published. No system, she wrote, has reconciled the needs for individual freedom and societal regulation.|$|E

His eclectic writing style has also been praised for its postmodern sensibilities and suitability for virtual space.|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1920s, Friedrich Christian was {{fundamentally}} {{convinced that}} those who still treasured the old values of the nobility needed {{to break down the}} ancient barriers separating them from the common people, reach out to the masses, and side with the National Socialists and their message.

2500|$|The {{naming of}} Kurt Hectic was {{inspired}} by two disparate sources. In {{the early stages of}} development, some of the team saw the 1993 Mike Leigh film, Naked, in which David Thewlis' character says to a junkie, [...] "What is it like in your head? Hectic?" [...] Bruty and Williams loved the line, and decided Hectic should be the character's surname. When trying to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first name, they wanted to name him after someone who lived a notoriously hectic life, and settled on Kurt Cobain.|$|E
2500|$|During a 2008 interview, {{when asked}} if he had ever benefited from his parents' {{connection}} to the entertainment industry, Thicke answered, [...] "It never helped.

Her husband has no ambition with clothing and does not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> appearance at all important, only wearing football tops. Jo wants to revamp her wardrobe but does not really have any knowledge about what clothing is suitable, and resorts to buying her clothes from magazines and only ventures to wear black. After Woodall and Constantine have taken them shopping for new clothing, Mark is improved when dressed in earthy tones which complement his skin tone. Jo sees her complexion brightened by the substitution of black to shades of copper, blue and red.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the gradual}} {{breakup of the}} Python troupe between Life of Brian in 1979 and The Meaning of Life in 1983, Gilliam became a screenwriter and director, {{building}} upon the experience he had acquired during the making of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. He says he used to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> films in terms of trilogies, starting with Time Bandits: the [...] "Trilogy of Imagination" [...] (written by Gilliam) about [...] "the ages of man" [...] in Time Bandits (1981), Brazil (1985), and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). All are about the [...] "craziness of our awkwardly ordered society {{and the desire to}} escape it through whatever means possible." [...] All three movies focus on these struggles and attempts to escape them through imagination; Time Bandits {{through the eyes of a}} child, Brazil through the eyes of a man in his thirties, and Munchausen, through the eyes of an elderly man.|$|E
2500|$|When Davout marched from Naumburg {{to glory}} at Auerstedt, Bernadotte refused {{to join his}} fellow marshal despite {{positive}} orders to do so. Instead, he executed an earlier set of orders to march to Dornburg and missed the fighting at both Jena and Auerstedt. Bernadotte found himself in serious trouble with his emperor. In a conversation with General of Division Jean Rapp Napoleon guessed that Bernadotte's behavior was caused by professional jealousy. The emperor remarked to General of Division Anne Jean Marie René Savary, [...] "This business is so hateful that if I send him before a court-martial {{it will be the}} equivalent of ordering him to be shot; it is better for me not to speak to him about it, but I shall take care he shall know what I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> behavior. I believe he has enough honor to recognize that he has performed a disgraceful action regarding which I shall not bandy words with him." [...] In the end, Bernadotte's career may have been saved because of Napoleon's fondness for his wife Désirée Clary, whom he almost married.|$|E
