5|$|Although aid {{operations}} {{continued for}} some time, the Iranian government ceased rescue work on May 14. No more survivors {{were expected to}} be found in <b>the</b> <b>rubble.</b>|$|E
5|$|Burial 24 was {{an elite}} status burial {{inserted}} into <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> core of Temple 33 {{during the final}} phase of the pyramid's construction. The tomb contained painted ceramic dishes that appear to name Nuun Ujol Chaak's father and grandfather, who both preceded him as rulers of the city.|$|E
5|$|At the school, the {{fatalities}} {{resulted from}} {{the collapse of a}} concrete block wall. One hallway completely collapsed, trapping many students in <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> of the hallway known as 3rd Hall. The tornado at the school was so strong that it tossed and mangled cars in the parking lot, flattened parts of the stadium and tore trees out of the ground. School buses were there for an early dismissal due to the storms at just after 1:00pm, but the tornado hit before the school could be dismissed.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the fourth}} {{season of the}} {{original}} series, Betty and Barney found an abandoned infant on their doorstep, {{by the name of}} [...] "Bamm-Bamm." [...] After a court battle for possession of Bamm-Bamm (in which <b>the</b> <b>Rubbles</b> faced <b>the</b> opposition's noted prehistoric lawyer [...] "Perry Masonry"), the couple were allowed to adopt Bamm-Bamm. <b>The</b> <b>Rubbles</b> never had children of their own.|$|R
50|$|The Flintstones and <b>the</b> <b>Rubbles</b> {{welcome a}} new strange family, The Frankenstones, to their Bedrock neighborhood.|$|R
5|$|Schools {{across the}} country were {{dismissed}} early and ordered closed. A photograph of firefighter Chris Fields emerging from <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> with infant Baylee Almon, who later died in a nearby hospital, was reprinted worldwide and {{became a symbol of}} the attack. The photo, taken by bank employee Charles H. PorterIV, won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography and appeared on newspapers and magazines for months following the attack.|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{fragments of}} the building— the wash-basin and two memorial tables from the forecourt, {{as well as some}} parts of a column— were saved by Ivo Kraus. He pulled them from <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> shortly after the end of World War II. The wash-basin and the memorial tables are now in the Zagreb City Museum. The column fragments are kept by the Jewish Community of Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the week}} of 11–18 December, the 1st Parachute Battalion from the German 1st Parachute Division—with {{supporting}} units—had prepared strong defences within the Italian coastal town of Ortona. Paratroop engineers and infantry had destroyed much of Ortona itself, turning the streets into a debris-filled maze. Major streets were mined, with demolition charges throughout the main piazza, and booby traps littered the town. German forces had also buried tanks in <b>the</b> <b>rubble,</b> leaving only the turrets exposed.|$|E

5|$|Catwoman ambushes Shreck in {{an attempt}} to kill him, but Batman stops her and unmasks himself. Catwoman removes her own mask when she rejects Wayne's {{attempts}} to reason with her. Shreck shoots Wayne and Kyle, leaving them wounded. Putting a taser to his lips, Kyle kisses Shreck while grabbing an exposed power cable, electrocuting him. Wayne uncovers Shreck's corpse while digging through <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> {{in an attempt}} to find Kyle. Cobblepot tries to kill Wayne with his umbrella, but dies from his injuries. His penguin family carry out a makeshift funeral.|$|E
5|$|Engine Co. 22's {{vehicle was}} blown across Broad Street and {{eventually}} burned. Several {{members of the}} company were injured. Hart was thrown across a rooftop by the explosion but only sustained a minor ankle injury. Augustus L. Cowdrey of Engine Co. 42 and Dave Van Winkle of Engine Co. 5 were throwing water on an adjacent building when a second explosion occurred in the warehouse. The explosion threw Van Winkle into the street. Cowdrey was killed, his body never found. His company continued to search for him amid <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> for two days. His name appears along with many others on a memorial in Trinity Churchyard in New York for volunteer firefighters {{who died in the}} line of duty.|$|E
5|$|Often {{armed with}} no more than shovels and spades, {{soldiers}} and civilians dug for bodies in <b>the</b> <b>rubble.</b> Other than this, rescue workers were faced with a number of obstacles, including the temperatures of the villages damaged. They were warm during the day, although the villages grew colder at night, making rescue work harder and threatening the health of the homeless and anyone alive and trapped under the debris. Many civilians were discouraged from helping due to fear of aftershocks. According to Gary Oshea of International Rescue, the volunteers did not have enough technical equipment, and the religious leaders seemed unwilling to contribute much. Official rescue work ended on June 24, 2002, when rescue workers said there were no more survivors.|$|E

5|$|Often, castles {{constructed}} {{before the}} age of gunpowder were incapable of using guns as their wall-walks were too narrow. A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> to provide a surface for the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle's defences. These could be built from earth or stone and were used to mount weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire was}} fed not merely by wood, fabrics, and thatch, Hanson points out, {{but also by}} the oil, pitch, coal, tallow, fats, sugar, alcohol, turpentine, and {{gunpowder}} stored in the riverside district. It melted the imported steel lying along the wharves (melting point between 1,250 and 1,480°C (2,300 and 2,700°F)) and the great iron chains and locks on the City gates (melting point between 1,100 and 1,650°C (2,000 and 3000°F)). Nor would anonymous bone fragments have been of much interest to the hungry people sifting through {{the tens of thousands of}} tons of rubble and debris after the fire, looking for valuables, or to the workmen clearing away <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> later during the rebuilding.|$|E
5|$|Triton's orbit upon capture {{would have}} been highly eccentric, and would have caused chaotic {{perturbations}} in the orbits of the original inner Neptunian satellites, causing them to collide and reduce to a disc of rubble. This means {{it is likely that}} Neptune's present inner satellites are not the original bodies that formed with Neptune. Only after Triton's orbit became circularised could some of <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> re-accrete into the present-day regular moons. This great perturbation may possibly be the reason why the satellite system of Neptune does not follow the 10,000:1 ratio of mass between the parent planet and all its moons seen in the satellite systems of all the other giant planets.|$|E

40|$|A {{pebbling}} move on a graph removes two pebbles at a vertex {{and adds}} one pebble at an adjacent vertex. Rubbling is {{a version of}} pebbling where an additional move is allowed. In this new move, one pebble each is removed at vertices $v$ and $w$ adjacent to a vertex $u$, and an extra pebble is added at vertex $u$. A vertex is reachable from a pebble distribution if {{it is possible to}} move a pebble to that vertex using <b>rubbling</b> moves. <b>The</b> <b>rubbling</b> number is <b>the</b> smallest number $m$ needed to guarantee that any vertex is reachable from any pebble distribution of $m$ pebbles. <b>The</b> optimal <b>rubbling</b> number is <b>the</b> smallest number $m$ needed to guarantee a pebble distribution of $m$ pebbles from which any vertex is reachable. We give bounds for rubbling and optimal rubbling numbers. In particular, we find an upper bound for <b>the</b> <b>rubbling</b> number of $n$-vertex, diameter $d$ graphs, and estimates for <b>the</b> maximum <b>rubbling</b> number of diameter 2 graphs. We also give a sharp upper bound for <b>the</b> optimal <b>rubbling</b> number, and sharp upper and lower bounds in terms of the diameter...|$|R
5|$|Alma is {{nonetheless}} freed when her storage chamber is opened by ATC researcher {{and leader of}} Project Origin, Harlan Wade (Grant Goodeve), who felt guilty over the company's treatment of Alma and who was actually her father. The player is then called to sabotage the structure's reactor, running a gauntlet against Alma's ghosts before the whole location explodes. In {{the aftermath of the}} detonation, a Delta Force Black Hawk helicopter extracts the Point Man from <b>the</b> <b>rubble,</b> rescuing him. While the player and the survivors of the F.E.A.R. team survey the results of the explosion from the helicopter, Jin wonders what happened to Alma. Just then, the helicopter loses power, and Alma is seen pulling herself up into the cabin: the destruction of the Origin facility has not stopped her quest to get closer to her son.|$|E
5|$|Bond survives {{attacks by}} Jaws, Chang's replacement, during Rio Carnival {{and on the}} Sugarloaf Cable Car. After Jaws' cable car crashes, he is rescued from <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> by Dolly, and the two fall in love. Drax's forces capture Goodhead, but Bond escapes; he learns that the toxin comes from a rare orchid {{indigenous}} to the Amazon jungle. Bond travels the Amazon River while under attack from Drax's forces; he eventually finds Drax's base near Iguazu Falls. Captured by Jaws, Bond is taken to Drax and witnesses four Moonrakers lifting off. Drax explains that he stole the loaned shuttle because another in his fleet had developed a fault during assembly. Bond and Goodhead escape and pose as pilots on Moonraker 6. The shuttles dock with Drax's space station, hidden from radar by a cloaking device.|$|E
5|$|By seven-thirty, {{the town}} was firmly {{in the hands of}} Major-General Hunter's force. Almost the {{entirety}} of the Mahdist garrison, excepting the cavalry, had been slain in desperate combats throughout the settlement. However, a few isolated pockets of Mahdist resistance remained in fortified houses, violently refusing to give up the fight. Six men sent to capture a Mahdist sniper's position in a small house near the river were each killed, forcing Hunter to invoke his artillery. The building was shelled to ruins, but the sniper survived, evidenced by the shooting of another soldier sent to locate his body. Finally, a second barrage of artillery blasted what remained of the structure and <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> fell silent, though the sniper's body was never found. The local inhabitants had armed themselves with clubs and spears to defend themselves during the battle, but played little role in its outcome.|$|E

5|$|Ganondorf appears and kidnaps Zelda, imprisoning {{her in his}} castle. The {{other six}} sages help Link {{infiltrate}} the stronghold; Link frees Zelda after defeating Ganondorf, who destroys the castle {{in an attempt to}} kill Link and Zelda. After they escape the collapsing castle, Ganondorf emerges from <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> and transforms into a boar-like monster named Ganon using the Triforce of Power. Ganon knocks the Master Sword from Link's hand; with Zelda's aid, Link retrieves the Master Sword and defeats Ganon. The seven sages seal Ganondorf in the Dark Realm; still holding the Triforce of Power, he vows to take revenge on their descendants. Zelda uses the Ocarina of Time to send Link back to his childhood. Navi departs and young Link meets Zelda in the castle garden once more, where he retains knowledge of Hyrule's fate, starting with Hyrule's decline.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, Angel {{escaped from}} a beachside hotel before its {{demolition}} {{in front of}} a crowd of about 50,000 people, an illusion that also aired on the television program. After the illusion, Angel showed the audience step by step how he achieved the escape. He first picked open a set of handcuffs that had him shackled to a balcony railing. He then smashed the window of the room in order to enter the hotel, and picked padlocks on both the room's internal door and the door to the stairwell. The escape was initially supposed to occur via a ladder that dangled above the hotel's roof 30 seconds before collapse, after picking through five locks on the roof's door. Instead, Angel emerged from <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> after the collapse, claiming that the initial plan was always to escape via the helicopter. The total time allotted for the entire illusion was 4 minutes, with dynamite located on the first, second, and fourth floors of the building.|$|E
5|$|Inward of Triton {{are seven}} small regular satellites, {{all of which}} have {{prograde}} orbits in planes that lie close to Neptune's equatorial plane; some of these orbit among Neptune's rings. The largest of them is Proteus. They were re-accreted from <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> disc generated after Triton's capture after the Tritonian orbit became circular. Neptune also has six more outer irregular satellites other than Triton, including Nereid, whose orbits are much farther from Neptune and at high inclination: three of these have prograde orbits, while the remainder have retrograde orbits. In particular, Nereid has an unusually close and eccentric orbit for an irregular satellite, suggesting that it may have once been a regular satellite that was significantly perturbed to its current position when Triton was captured. The two outermost Neptunian irregular satellites, Psamathe and Neso, have the largest orbits of any natural satellites discovered in the Solar System to date.|$|E
50|$|Cliff {{holds an}} {{aptitude}} test, where the worker {{with the highest}} mark will become the new {{vice president of the}} company. Barney gets the highest score but he switches his paper with Fred, who he knows will fail. Fred receives the promotion, but his first order is to dismiss Barney, since Barney now effectively has the lowest score. Fred doesn't want to fire him, but Vandercave tells Fred if he doesn't fire him, he will fire Barney for him and Fred will be fired too. Fred reluctant accepts, but does his best to help Barney support his family, even inviting <b>the</b> <b>Rubbles</b> to live with them so that they can rent out their home. However, Fred's job and newfound wealth put a strain on his relationships with Wilma and <b>the</b> <b>Rubbles.</b> Cliff eventually tricks Fred into dismissing the workers, over the objections of his office Dictabird.
