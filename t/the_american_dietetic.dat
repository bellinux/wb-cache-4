40|$|This review {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the most effective treatment for iron deficiency in women in developed countries and children in developing countries with consideration of side effects, adherence and sustainability. Studies were excluded if they involved: disease states affecting iron status; pregnant, lactating or postpartum women; groups of participants with mean haemoglobin and/or serum ferritin above deficient cut-offs at baseline; articles published prior to 1980; studies of animals and studies not written in English. All included articles were assessed for quality using <b>the</b> 2008 <b>American</b> <b>Dietetic</b> Association Quality Criteria Checklist. Most articles were of a high quality with nine being scored positively and five scoring a neutral result. Fourteen randomised trials were found, with two studies on adult women in developed countries and twelve studies on children in developing countries. Iron supplementation was {{the most effective and}} timely solution; however, side effects were common. A 30 - 60 mg daily dose of elemental iron may correct iron deficiency anaemia within 8 weeks. Dietary strategies and fortification showed promising results over a longer time period. Limitations of research included: nutritional and disease confounders such as multiple nutrient deficiencies and parasitic infection; lack of international uniformity of haematological definition of iron deficiencies; side effects of iron therapy affecting adherence to treatments; and treatment effectiveness being dependent on individual variations in iron absorption depending on stage of iron depletion and duration of study. Further longer-term research and research on supplement and fortificant formulation is required. No Full Tex...|$|R

Statistics show that <b>the</b> diet of <b>Americans</b> needs improvement (Guenther et al., 2007) indicating possible lack knowledge of what healthy eating behaviors are.

In an effort to provide a college community with credible nutrition education based on dietary analysis and stage of change, a nutrition assessment and consultation program was developed and implemented at a college campus during the fall 2003 quarter. It was integrated into the existing fitness testing and prescription program, polyFIT. Seven students, referred to as fitness consultants, majoring in Nutrition or Kinesiology were recruited and trained to distribute appropriate education based on individual clients’ dietary analysis, a stage of change assessment and personal goals. Intervention materials were constructed using a variety of resources focusing on areas of nutrition. Thirty clients participated during the fall 2003 quarter; all were freshman and sophomores enrolled in a Healthy Living course. Separate survey questionnaires were designed for the consultants and the clients to gather their perceptions of the program components.

2500|$|Vegetarian diets {{typically}} contain similar {{levels of}} iron to non-vegetarian diets, {{but this has}} lower bioavailability than iron from meat sources, and its absorption can sometimes be inhibited by other dietary constituents. According to the Vegetarian Resource Group, consuming food that contains vitamin C, such as citrus fruit or juices, tomatoes, or broccoli, {{is a good way}} to increase the amount of iron absorbed at a meal. Vegetarian foods rich in iron include black beans, cashews, hempseed, kidney beans, broccoli, lentils, oatmeal, raisins, [...] spinach, cabbage, lettuce, black-eyed peas, soybeans, many breakfast cereals, sunflower seeds, chickpeas, tomato juice, tempeh, molasses, thyme, and whole-wheat bread. The related vegan diets can often be higher in iron than vegetarian diets, because dairy products are low in iron. Iron stores often tend to be lower in vegetarians than non-vegetarians, and a few small studies report very high rates of iron deficiency (up to 40%, and 58% of the respective vegetarian or vegan groups).
