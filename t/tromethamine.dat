40|$|BACKGROUND: Uncomplicated {{urinary tract}} infections (UTIs) are common among female patients. According to the {{national}} guidelines of the Dutch College of General Practitioners (GPs), the drugs of first and second choice as therapy for UTIs are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim with resistance percentages of 2 % and 23 %, respectively. The third choice is fosfomycin <b>tromethamine</b> for which no current resistance data from The Netherlands are available. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine these resistance percentages. METHODS: During 2003 - 04, urine samples were collected from a representative sample of 21 general practices spread over The Netherlands, the Sentinel Stations of The Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (NIVEL). Escherichia coli isolated from female patients visiting their GP with symptoms of an acute, uncomplicated UTI were used. Fosfomycin <b>tromethamine</b> susceptibility was determined by Etests. An MIC of fosfomycin <b>tromethamine</b> of 64 mg/L or lower was considered to indicate susceptibility, and MIC values of 96 mg/L or higher were considered to indicate resistance. E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as a reference strain. RESULTS: In total, 1705 E. coli strains were tested, of which 11 (0. 65 %) were resistant to fosfomycin <b>tromethamine.</b> The MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for this population were 1 and 4 mg/L, respectively. Within the inhibition zone of 162 susceptible E. coli, resistant mutant colonies were observed, of which after repetition of the susceptibility testing 68 were resistant. In total, 79 (5 %) strains were resistant to fosfomycin <b>tromethamine.</b> There was no cross-resistance observed between fosfomycin <b>tromethamine</b> and other antimicrobial agents tested previously. CONCLUSIONS: The high in vitro susceptibility to fosfomycin <b>tromethamine</b> in this population and the lack of cross-resistance between fosfomycin <b>tromethamine</b> and other agents together with the extensive global clinical experience support the choice of the national guidelines of the Dutch College of GPs to include fosfomycin <b>tromethamine</b> as a therapeutic option in general practice for uncomplicated UTI...|$|E

40|$|Background: Diseases and {{abnormal}} conditions may cause severe pain, such as bone fracture. An accurate pain management is needed, in which opioid analgesic {{is the best}} choice. However, opioid is associated with addiction and side effects that affect the central nervous system. Therefore, ketorolac <b>tromethamine,</b> an NSAID, is used.

Objective: To investigate the effects of ketorolac <b>tromethamine</b> intraperitoneal injection on the histology of gaster in adult Wistar rats with crural fracture. Methods: An experimental study with post test only control group design. A sample of 20 Wistar rats divided into 2 groups, and had their right cruris fracturised.

40|$|Ketorolac <b>tromethamine</b> is a non-steroidal {{drug that}} has potent {{analgesic}} and moderate anti-inflammatory activity. A single dose of ketorolac <b>tromethamine</b> is clinically {{more effective than}} that of many drugs {{in the management of}} moderate to severe postoperative pain. Transdermal delivery of ketorolac <b>tromethamine</b> seems as a potential method of administration that would be non-invasive and eliminate repeated dosing regimens. Although a transdermal dosage form of ketorolac has not arrived in the market, permeation enhancement of ketorolac <b>tromethamine</b> transdermally and topically {{has been the subject of}} several pharmaceutical research studies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible release enhancement effects of several commonly used skin emollient substances on the in vitro release of ketorolac <b>tromethamine</b> from topical emulsion formulations. The O/W emulsions containing 1. 65 % ketorolac <b>tromethamine</b> were prepared as topical formulations. Six different emulsions with three different emollients; sucrose polysoyate, di-ppg- 2 -myreth- 10 adipate, and ppg- 3 -benzyl myristate at 1 and 5 % levels were prepared. The release of ketorolac <b>tromethamine</b> from each emulsion was studied in vitro using static Franz diffusion cells. The diffusion studies were conducted across cellulose ester and silicone membranes. A validated HPLC assay method was used to analyze the drug concentration. A linear mixed-effect model was used to test the statistical significance of all the release rates from the six emulsions compared to the control at a significance level of p The release experiment results show that sucrose polysoyate significantly increased the release rate of ketorolac <b>tromethamine</b> both at 1 and 5 % levels across the silicone membrane, although it increased the release rate of the drug only at 5 % ratio across the cellulose ester membrane. According to the rheological analysis results, addition of sucrose polysoyate at 5 % level increased the complex viscosity and the thixotropy values. Di-ppg- 2 -myreth- 10 adipate also increased the release rate of the drug both at 1 and 5 % levels across the silicone membrane, however it had no effect on the release rate of the drug at 1 % and significantly decreased the release rate of the drug at the 5 % concentration across the cellulose ester membrane. The addition of di-ppg- 2 - myreth-l 0 adipate both at 1 and 5 % concentrations showed a decrease in the complex viscosity and the thixotropy values. PPG- 3 - benzyl myristate increased the release rate of ketorolac <b>tromethamine</b> both at I and 5 % concentrations across the cellulose ester and the silicone membrane. PPG- 3 -benzyl myristate, at 1 % level increased the complex viscosity and the thixotropy value however it had no effect on the viscosity, and lowered the thixotropy at 5 % level. Our in vitro test results helped us understand how the skin emollients may affect the diffusion rate of ketorolac <b>tromethamine</b> out of topical formulations and as O/W emulsions across two different membranes. It also gave us an idea whether these emollient substances could be studied and evaluated further as potential permeation enhancers for in vivo studies.

Moreover, the proposed HPLC method was utilized to investigate the pH dependent degradation kinetics of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and ketorolac <b>tromethamine</b> in buffer solutions at different pH values like 2. 0, 6. 8 and 9. 0. Results and Conclusion: The retention time (t R) of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and ketorolac <b>tromethamine</b> were 3. 81 ± 0. 01 and 8. 82 ± 0. 02 min, respectively.

On the other hand, all the treated groups showed significantly (P< 0. 05) lower plasma progesterone concentrations as compared to that of control cows starting from the evening of day- 11 till the morning of day- 13 of the oestrus cycle. The plasma progesterone concentrations decreased to 0. 80 ± 0. 10, 0. 85 ± 0. 05 and 0. 70 ± 0. 10 ηg/ml at the onset of oestrus in Dinoprost <b>Tromethamine,</b> Cloprostenol Sodium and dextro-rotatory D-Cloprostenol treated cows within 68. 00 ± 4. 00, 64. 00 ± 8. 00 and 88. 00 ± 8. 00 hours after the treatment, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Ketorolac <b>Tromethamine</b> {{is having}} {{analgesic}} and NSAID category, the general side effect {{are related to}} gastrointestinal tract. Reduction of side effects while prolonging its action by using controlled release of oral dosage forms is highly desirable. In the present study direct compression method {{is used for the}} preparation of fabricated batches and EudragitL 100 is used as coating polymer for enteric coating. In vitro release profiles of batches F 1 -F 4 shows that Ketorolac <b>Tromethamine</b> in drug :polymer ratio with Guar gum, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl cellulose and Sodium alginate give 79. 32 %, 91. 52 %, 88. 35 % and 92. 19 % drug release respectively in 12 hours. In vitro release profile of batches F 5 -F 8 shows that Ketorolac <b>Tromethamine</b> in ratio 1 : 4 with Guar gum, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl cellulose and Sodium alginate gives release of 85. 21 %, 95. 52 %, 93. 50 %, 97. 24 % respectively in 12 hours. In vitro release profile of batches F 9 -F 12 shows that Ketorolac <b>Tromethamine</b> in ratio 1 : 3 with Guar gum, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl cellulose and Sodium alginate gives release of 89. 50 %, 98. 25 %, 95. 22 %, 100. 27 % respectively in 12 hours. All the batches showed no drug release in first two hours in hydrochloric buffer of pH 1. 2 and then showed higher increase in phosphate buffer of pH 6. 0 up to 12 hours. All these batches follow near zero order kinetic. This indicates that the Guar Gum, Xanthan Gum and Ethyl cellulose and Sodium alginate at minimum concentration is not only able to sustain but also control the drug release...|$|E
