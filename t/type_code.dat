25|$|The unique {{identity}} is a mandatory requirement for RFID tags, despite special {{choice of the}} numbering scheme. RFID tag data capacity is large enough that each individual tag will have a unique code, while current bar codes are limited to a single <b>type</b> <b>code</b> for a particular product. The uniqueness of RFID tags means that a product may be tracked as it moves from location to location, finally ending up in the consumer's hands. This may help to combat theft {{and other forms of}} product loss. The tracing of products is an important feature that gets well supported with RFID tags containing a unique identity of the tag and also the serial number of the object. This may help companies cope with quality deficiencies and resulting recall campaigns, but also contributes to concern about tracking and profiling of consumers after the sale.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{languages}} {{are becoming increasingly}} popular for different software development scenarios such as rapid prototyping because of the flexibility and agile interactive development they offer. The benefits of dynamic {{languages are}}, however, counteracted by many limitations produced {{by the lack of}} static typing. In order to obtain the benefits of both approaches, some programming languages offer a hybrid dynamic and static type system. The existing IDEs for these hybrid typing languages do not provide any type-based feature when dynamic typing is used, lacking important IDE facilities offered for statically <b>typed</b> <b>code.</b> We have implemented a constraint-based type inference system that gathers type information of dynamic references at compile time. Using this type information, we have extended a professional IDE to offer those type-based features missed for dynamically <b>typed</b> <b>code.</b> Following the Separation of Concerns principle, the IDE has also been customized to facilitate the conversion of dynamically <b>typed</b> <b>code</b> into statically <b>typed</b> one, and vice versa...|$|R
