5|$|<b>The</b> <b>circuit</b> {{passed its}} final {{inspection}} in May 2016 with FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting declaring his satisfaction that <b>the</b> <b>circuit</b> {{would be ready}} {{in time for the}} race. <b>The</b> <b>circuit</b> attracted some criticism from drivers who highlighted a lack of run-off in some corners and the tight pit entry positioned at one of the fastest points on <b>the</b> <b>circuit.</b> Following problems with loose kerbs in free practice, changes were made in turns 6 and 12, where the kerbs were replaced by painted markings on the track. Further revisions were made to the pit entry ahead of qualifying, extending the white line denoting the entry lane to allow drivers more time to react to cars entering the pit.|$|E
