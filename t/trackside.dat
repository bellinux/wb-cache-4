5|$|The {{gathering}} of the dignitaries at the station and {{the departure of the}} trains was a major event. Every hotel room and lodging-house in Liverpool was full the night before. From 9.00am onwards the area around the station was filled with people, and crowds thronged the <b>trackside</b> at Liverpool to watch the trains depart. One group of men had each paid two shillings for access to the best vantage point, the top of a chimney near the tunnel leading to Crown Street railway station; they were hoisted up by rope and board shortly after dawn to watch proceedings.|$|E
5|$|The stadium's {{foundation}} {{stone was}} laid by Prime Minister Tony Blair in December 1999, and construction began in January 2000. The stadium {{was designed by}} Arup Associates and constructed by Laing Construction {{at a cost of}} approximately £112 million, £77 million of which was provided by Sport England, with the remainder funded by Manchester City Council. For the Commonwealth Games, the stadium featured a single lower tier of seating running around three sides of the athletics track, and second tiers to the two sides, with an open-air temporary stand at the northern end; initially providing a seating capacity for the Games of 38,000, subsequently extended to 41,000 through the installation of additional temporary <b>trackside</b> seating along the east and south stands.|$|E
5|$|Starting on 1 May, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} a three-day test at the Mugello Circuit in Italy {{ahead of the}} Spanish Grand Prix. The test gave teams the opportunity to assess major aerodynamic upgrades before racing them. HRT elected not {{to take part in}} the test, instead choosing to concentrate on establishing themselves at their new headquarters in Madrid. Both Lotus's <b>trackside</b> operations director Alan Permane and Red Bull Racing driver Mark Webber questioned the value of testing at the Mugello circuit as the characteristics of the circuit were unlike any of the circuits the championship was due to visit after the test, while Caterham driver Vitaly Petrov was critical of the choice of Mugello as a testing venue as he felt it was not safe enough for Formula One. Petrov's comments came shortly after Fernando Alonso crashed on the final morning of the test. Red Bull Racing and Lotus team principals Christian Horner and Éric Boullier were also critical of the test as they felt that the costs of conducting in-season testing outweighed any benefits, with Horner stating his opposition to continuing mid-season testing in the future.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} Nato, Haryanto and Binder went {{three abreast}} at the Casino hairpin which saw Haryanto squeezed wide at the corner's exit by Nato and {{was unable to}} leave the turn, causing a brief usage of the VSC to allow the three cars to be extracted from the circuit by a <b>trackside</b> crane. Nato was able to continue but made a pit stop for repairs and was issued with a ten-second time penalty because he was judged to have caused the collision. The race resumed on the second lap with Stanaway leading Maricello and Sirotkin. Stanaway pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field. Leal was overtaken for fourth place by Canamasas at Sainte Dévote on the seventh lap's start and narrowly made the corner. Stanaway led the field by three seconds at the race's mid-way point while Maricello was two seconds in front of Sirotkin. Stanaway's team cautioned him about the possibility of his tyres degrading if he continued to push hard. Few overtaking manoeuvres took place as the field spread out. Rossi and Vandoorne intentionally fell back from the leaders and both drivers started to record fastest lap times in an effort of earning the accolade of one point for setting the event's fastest lap. Vandoorne temporarily claimed the award with a lap time of one minute and 21.926 seconds, before Nato gained the accolade on the 30th lap with a time of one minute and 21.886 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Vergne {{dropped down}} the order when his car {{developed}} a water pump battery failure {{and was forced}} to make an unscheduled pit stop to move into his second vehicle on lap eight, while di Grassi made his required pit stop for a replacement front wing on the same lap and narrowly avoided striking a <b>trackside</b> marshal after leaving his pit stall. López had dropped to 18th place by the start of the following lap. Bird briefly reduced the time deficit to Piquet until the latter responded to the Virgin car's fast pace. Rosenqvist lost control of the back-end of his car and slid backwards into the turn five barrier on the 14th lap, damaging his rear wing. The incident forced him to make a pit stop for the switch into his second car. López carried a large amount of speed exiting the chicane and made heavy contact with the wall on lap 17. Piquet was close behind him and took avoiding action but reacted late and had an understeer which sent him into the barrier. He did not damage his car and was able to reverse out of the barrier but lost the lead to Bird and Buemi moved into second place. The incident necessitated the deployment of the safety car to allow marshals to repair the wall and extract López's car from the track. Some drivers (including Buemi) elected to make mandatory pit stops to switch into their second cars under safety car conditions {{at the end of the}} 20th lap.|$|E

25|$|At {{the season}} finale held in Australia, Häkkinen's car {{suffered}} a tyre failure during the event's first qualifying session on Friday, which resulted in his car becoming airborne and crashing sideways into the crash barrier {{on the outside of}} Brewery corner, the fastest corner of the Adelaide Street Circuit, at an estimated speed of 120mph. The session was suspended with Häkkinen being critically injured due to sustaining a skull fracture, internal bleeding and a blockage of his airway. His life was saved by the efforts of the <b>trackside</b> medical team which included doctors from the Royal Adelaide Hospital, one of whom performed an emergency cricothyroidotomy at the <b>trackside.</b> Häkkinen was immediately transported by ambulance to the nearby Royal Adelaide Hospital which was luckily located only about half a kilometre from the circuit. There he remained in a critical condition under care of the Trauma Service, the Neurosurgical Unit, and the Intensive Care Unit and remained in the hospital for approximately two months. He eventually made a remarkable recovery. Häkkinen finished the season seventh in the Drivers' Championship, with 17 points.|$|E

40|$|Dianthus armeria is a tall, slender {{plant with}} a hairy inflorescence, leaf-like bracts and deep-pink petals with very small white spots.

40|$|Low-energy {{rockfall}} catch {{fence is}} a mechanical structure that uses along the <b>tracksides</b> {{in the mountain}} regions to stop destabilised rocks and debris, which located on side slopes, from reaching and damaging the train track. In contrast to other means of rockfall protection systems that use bespoke components and require heavy machinery for installation, low energy catch fence uses readily available components and requires only manpower for installation. This makes it a cheaper and a practical solution for railway safety projects. However, these fences were developed primarily by engineering experience which cannot ensure effective protection over {{the wide range of}} loading conditions. Thus, an effective design approach is needed to ensure the fence can provide the required level of protection. As one of the largest railway infrastructure services contractors in the UK, QTS Ltd engaged with the University of Glasgow in this KTP project to develop the design of low energy rockfall catch fences in order to enhance safety on the railways. The project aims to develop an efficient and a cost-effective design of low energy rockfall catch fences by using advanced numerical modelling techniques and full-scale field tests...|$|R
