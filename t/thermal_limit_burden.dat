40|$|Aim Understanding the {{stability}} of realised niches is crucial for predicting the responses of species to climate change. One approach is to evaluate the niche differences of populations {{of the same species}} that occupy regions that are geographically disconnected. Here, we assess niche conservatism along thermal gradients for 26 plant species with a disjunct distribution between the Alps and the Arctic. Location European Alps and Norwegian Finnmark. Methods We collected a comprehensive dataset of 26 arctic-alpine plant occurrences in two regions. We assessed niche conservatism through a multi-species comparison and analysed species rankings at cold and warm <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> along two distinct gradients corresponding to (1) air temperatures at 2 meters above ground level and (2) elevation distances to the treeline (TLD) for the two regions. We assessed whether observed relationships were close to those predicted under <b>thermal</b> <b>limit</b> conservatism. Results We found a weak similarity in species ranking at the warm <b>thermal</b> <b>limits.</b> The range of warm <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> for the 26 species was much larger in the Alps than in Finnmark. We found a stronger similarity in species ranking and correspondence at the cold <b>thermal</b> <b>limit</b> along the gradients of 2 -m temperature and TLD. Yet, along the 2 -m temperature gradient, the cold <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> of species in the Alps were lower on average than those in Finnmark. Main conclusion We found low conservatism of the warm <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> but a stronger conservatism of the cold <b>thermal</b> <b>limits.</b> We suggest that biotic interactions at the warm <b>thermal</b> <b>limit</b> likely modulate species responses more strongly than at the cold limit. The differing biotic context between the two regions is likely responsible for the observed differences in realised niches...|$|R

40|$|The climate {{variability}} hypothesis {{proposes that}} in variable temperate climates poikilothermic animals have wide thermal tolerance windows, whereas in constant tropical climates they have small thermal tolerance windows. In {{this study we}} quantified and compared {{the upper and lower}} lethal <b>thermal</b> tolerance <b>limits</b> of numerous bivalve species from a tropical (Roebuck Bay, north western Australia) and a temperate (Wadden Sea, north western Europe) tidal flat. Species from tropical Roebuck Bay had higher upper and lower lethal <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> than species from the temperate Wadden Sea, and Wadden Sea species showed an ability to survive freezing temperatures. The increased freezing resistance of the Wadden Sea species resulted in thermal tolerance windows that were on average 7 °C greater than the Roebuck Bay species. Furthermore, at a local-scale, the upper lethal <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> of the Wadden Sea species were positively related to submersion time and thus to encountered temperature variation, but {{this was not the case}} for the Roebuck Bay species. A review of previous studies, at a global scale, showed that upper lethal <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> of tropical species are closer to maximum habitat temperatures than the upper lethal <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> of temperate species, suggesting that temperate species are better adapted to temperature variation.

40|$|The acute thermal {{tolerance}} of ectotherms has been measured {{in a variety}} of ways; these include assays where organisms are shifted abruptly to stressful temperatures and assays where organisms experience temperatures that are ramped more slowly to stressful levels. Ramping assays are thought to be more relevant to natural conditions where sudden abrupt shifts are unlikely to occur often, but {{it has been argued that}} <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> established under ramping conditions are underestimates of true <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> because stresses due to starvation and/or desiccation can arise under ramping. These confounding effects might also impact the variance and heritability of thermal tolerance. We argue here that ramping assays are useful in capturing aspects of ecological relevance even though there is potential for confounding effects of other stresses that can also influence <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> in nature. Moreover, we show that the levels of desiccation and starvation experienced by ectotherms in ramping assays will often be minor unless the assays involve small animals and last for many hours. Empirical data illustrate that the combined effects of food and humidity on <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> under ramping and sudden shifts to stressful conditions are unpredictable; in Drosophila melanogaster the presence of food decreased rather than increased <b>thermal</b> <b>limits,</b> whereas in Ceratitis capitata they had little impact. The literature provides examples where <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> are increased under ramping presumably because of the potential for physiological changes leading to acclimation. It is unclear whether heritabilities and population differentiation will necessarily be lower under ramping because of confounding effects. Although it is important to clearly define experimental methods, particularly when undertaking comparative assessments, and to understand potential confounding effects, thermotolerance assays based on ramping remain an important tool for understanding and predicting species responses to environmental change. An important area for further development is to identify the impact of rates of temperature change under field and laboratory conditions. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Vertical zonation of {{intertidal}} organisms, {{from the}} shallow subtidal to the supralittoral zones, is a ubiquitous feature of temperate and tropical rocky shores. Organisms that live {{higher on the}} shore experience larger daily and seasonal fluctuations in microhabitat conditions, due to their greater exposure to terrestrial conditions during emersion. Comparative analyses of the adaptive linkage between physiolog-ical tolerance limits and vertical distribution are the most powerful when the study species are closely related and occur in discrete vertical zones throughout the intertidal range. Here, I summarize work on the phys-iological tolerance limits of rocky intertidal zone porcelain crab species of the genus Petrolisthes to emersion-related heat stress. In the eastern Pacific, Petrolisthes species live throughout temperate and tropical regions, and are found in discrete vertical intertidal zones in each region. Whole organism <b>thermal</b> tolerance <b>limits</b> of Petrolisthes species, and <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> of heart and nerve function reflect microhabitat conditions. Species living higher in the intertidal zone are more eurythermal than low-intertidal congeners, tropical species have the highest <b>thermal</b> <b>limits,</b> and the differences in thermal tolerance between low- and high-intertidal species is greatest for temperate crabs. Acclimation of <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> of high-intertidal species is restricted as compared to low-intertidal species. Thus, because <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> of high-intertidal species are near current habitat temperature maxima, global warming could most strongly impact intertidal species...|$|R
40|$|Physiological {{processes}} that set an organism’s <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> are in part determining recent shifts in biogeographic distribution ranges {{due to global}} climate change. Several characteristics of the heat-shock response (HSR), such as the onset, maximal, and upper limit of heat-shock protein (Hsp) synthesis, contribute to setting the acute upper <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> of most organisms. Aquatic animals from stable, moderately variable, or highly variable thermal environments differ in their HSR. Some animals living in extremely stable thermal environments lack the response altogether. In contrast, rocky intertidal animals that experience highly variable thermal conditions start synthesizing Hsps, that is, the onset of synthesis, below the highest temperatures that they experience. Thus, these organisms experience thermal conditions in their environment that {{are close to the}} upper <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> in which they can defend themselves against cellular thermal insults by employing the HSR. Subtidal animals are characterized bymoderately variable thermal environments, and their cells start synthesizing Hsps above the highest temperatures that they experience. The upper <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> against which they can defend themselves are thus much higher than the highest body temperatures they currently experience. Furthermore, the ability to acclimate to changing thermal conditions seems greatest among animals from moderately variable environments and limited in animals from stable and highly variable environments. Thus, these findings suggest that organisms with the narrowest (stenothermal) and the widest (highly eurythermal) temperature tolerance ranges live closest to their <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> and have a limited ability to acclimate, suggesting that they will be most affected by global climate change...|$|R
40|$|The <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> of {{individual}} animals were originally proposed as {{a link between}} animal physiology and thermal ecology. Although this link is valid in theory, the evaluation of physiological tolerances involves some problems that {{are the focus of}} this study. One rationale was that heating rates shall influence upper critical limits, so that ecological <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> need to consider experimental heating rates. In addition, if <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> are not surpassed in experiments, subsequent tests of the same individual should yield similar results or produce evidence of hardening. Finally, several non-controlled variables such as time under experimental conditions and procedures may affect results. To analyze these issues we conducted an integrative study of upper critical temperatures in a single species, the ant Atta sexdens rubropiosa, an animal model providing large numbers {{of individual}}s of diverse sizes but similar genetic makeup. Our specific aims were to test the 1) influence of heating rates in the experimental evaluation of upper critical temperature, 2) assumptions of absence of physical damage and reproducibility, and 3) sources of variance often overlooked in the thermal-limits literature; and 4) to introduce some experimental approaches that may help researchers to separate physiological and methodological issues. The upper <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> were influenced by both heating rates and body mass. In the latter case, the effect was physiological rather than methodological. The critical temperature decreased during subsequent tests performed on the same individual ants, even one week after the initial test. Accordingly, upper <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> may have been overestimate...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} gain {{insights}} into links between fitness and physiological function, the phenotypic plasticity of life-history traits and thermal tolerances has been investigated in a laboratory strain of the polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica acclimated to {{a broad range of}} temperatures. Reproductive pairs were kept in isolation for two months at one of six temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 °C), and survival and a number of life-history traits recorded. Tolerance to heat and cold was assessed in individuals that survived the acclimation period by measuring upper and lower <b>thermal</b> <b>limits.</b> Life-history and <b>thermal</b> tolerance traits showed different relationships with temperature: generally non-monotonic for life-history and monotonic for <b>thermal</b> <b>limits.</b> The <b>thermal</b> history of the strain used in the study seemed to be partly responsible for this pattern, affecting the thermal responses of most life-history traits, but not those of the upper and lower <b>thermal</b> <b>limits.</b> Survival correlated positively with tolerance to cold but not with heat tolerance. This result supports the idea that tolerance to heat is under stronger selection in O. labronica, resulting in a lower level of plasticity for this trait. Some life-history features positively co-varied with tolerance to heat (e. g. body size), whilst in other cases reproductive traits showed apparent trade-offs with <b>thermal</b> <b>limits.</b> In all cases correlations amongst traits were apparently driven by their relationship with temperature. Even if we found no evolutionary trade-offs among the thermal responses of life-history traits and <b>thermal</b> <b>limits,</b> the strategies evolved by organisms to cope with thermal variability result from the mutual interaction of these traits, which {{plays a key role in}} defining organisms' responses to temperature changes and fluctuations...|$|R

40|$|Temperature is a {{fundamental}} environmental force shaping species abundance and distributions through its effects on biochemical reaction rates, metabolism, activity, and reproduction. In light of future climate shifts, mainly driven by temperature increases, how will organisms persist in warmer environments? One molecular mechanism that may {{play an important role}} in coping with heat stress is the heat shock response (HSR), which protects against molecular damage. To prevent and repair protein damage specifically, Hsps activate and become up-regulated. However, the functional diversity and relevance of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in extending upper <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> in taxonomic groups outside marine and model systems is poorly understood. Ants are a good system to understand the physiological mechanisms for coping with heat stress because they have successfully diversified into thermally stressful environments. To identify and characterize the functional diversity of Hsps in ants, I surveyed Hsp orthologues from published ant genomes to test for signatures of positive selection and to reconstruct their evolutionary history. Within Hymenoptera, ants utilize unique sets of Hsps for the HSR. Stabilizing selection was the prevailing force among Hsp orthologues, suggesting that protein activity is conserved. At the same time, regulatory regions (promoters) governing transcriptional up-regulation diversified: species differ in the number and location of heat shock elements (HSEs). Therefore, Hsp expression patterns may be a target for selection in warm environments. I tested whether Hsp expression corresponded with variation in upper <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> in forest ant species within the genus Aphaenogaster. Whole colonies were collected throughout the eastern United States and were lab acclimated. There was a positive relationship between upper <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> (Critical <b>Thermal</b> maxima, CTmax) and local temperature extremes. Upper <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> were also higher in ant species that lived in open habitats (shrub-oak and long-leaf pine savannah) than species occupying closed habitats (deciduous forest). Ant species with higher CTmax expressed Hsps more slowly, at higher temperatures, and at higher maximum levels than those with low CTmax. Because Hsps sense and repair molecular damage, these results suggest the proteomes of open relative to closed canopy forests are more stable. Although deciduous forest ant species may be buffered from temperature stress, it is likely that temperature interacts with other environmental stressors such as water and nutrient availability that may impact upper <b>thermal</b> <b>limits.</b> I measured the influence of dehydration and nutrition stress on upper <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> of forest ants from a single population. Ants that were initially starved were much less thermally tolerant than controls and ants that were initially desiccated. Because ants are likely to experience similar combination of stressors in the wild, upper <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> may be severely overestimated in single factor experiments. Therefore, realistic forecasting models need to consider multiple environmental stressors. Overall, adaptive tuning of Hsp expression that reflects better protection and tolerance of protein unfolding may have facilitated ant diversification into warm environments. However, additional stressors and mechanisms may constrain the evolution of upper <b>thermal</b> <b>limits...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{tenet of}} macroecology is that {{physiological}} processes of organisms {{are linked to}} large-scale geographical patterns in environmental conditions. Species at higher latitudes experience greater seasonal temperature variation and are consequently predicted to withstand greater temperature extremes. We tested for relationships between breadths of thermal tolerance in ectothermic animals and the latitude of specimen location using all available data, while accounting for habitat, hemisphere, methodological differences and taxonomic affinity. We found that thermal tolerance breadths generally increase with latitude, and do so at a greater rate in the Northern Hemisphere. In terrestrial ectotherms, upper <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> vary little while lower <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> decrease with latitude.

40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} warming on the {{persistence}} {{and distribution of}} ectotherms is often forecasted from their warming tolerance, inferred as the difference between their upper <b>thermal</b> <b>limit</b> and macroclimate temperature. Ectotherms, however, are thermally adapted to their microclimates, which can deviate substantially from macroscale conditions.

The model shows a concomitant increase in microclimate temperatures and <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> across insect ontogeny, {{despite the fact that}} they all share the same macroclimate. Consequently, warming tolerance, as estimated from microclimate temperature, remained constant across ontogeny.

Long extra high voltage (EHV) ac lines cannot be loaded to their <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> due to this instability occurs in the power system. With the scheme proposed in this paper,it is possible to load these lines very close to their <b>thermal</b> <b>limits.</b> The conductors are allowed to carry usual ac along dc superimposed on it. The advantage of parallel ac-dc transmission for improvement of transient stability and dynamic stability and dampout oscillations have been established. Simulation study is carried out in MATLAB software package. The results shows the stability of power system when compared with only ac transmission.

40|$|The {{power system}} is {{dependent}} on a stable and reliable control of active and reactive power to keep its integrity. Loosing this command {{may lead to a}} system collapse. It is difficult to load the long extra high voltage ac lines against their <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> because of volatility incident in the power system. The aim {{of this paper is to}} enhance the transient steadiness of power scheme by establishing simultaneous AC– DC power transmission through a transmission line. With the scheme suggested in this paper, it is more likely to load these lines very close to their <b>thermal</b> <b>limits.</b> The benefit of simultaneous ac-dc transmission is for up gradation of transient steadiness and dynamic steadiness. Damp out oscillations have been established. Simulations have been done in MATLAB software package (Simulink Model) ...|$|R
50|$|When the {{workload}} on the processor calls for faster performance, the processor's clock {{will try to}} increase the operating frequency in regular increments as required to meet demand. The increased clock rate {{is limited by the}} processor's power, current, <b>thermal</b> <b>limits,</b> the number of cores currently in use, and the maximum frequency of the active cores. Frequency increases occur in increments of 133 MHz for Nehalem processors and 100 MHz for Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell and Skylake processors. When any electrical or <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> are exceeded, the operating frequency automatically decreases in decrements of 133 or 100 MHz until the processor is again operating within its design limits. Turbo Boost 2.0 was introduced in 2011 with the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture, while Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 was introduced in 2016 with the Broadwell-E microarchitecture.|$|R
40|$|Synopsis <b>Thermal</b> <b>limits</b> in ectotherms {{may arise}} through a {{mismatch}} between {{supply and demand}} of oxygen. At higher temperatures, the ability of their cardiac and ventilatory activities to supply oxygen becomes insufficient to meet their elevated oxygen demand. Consequently, higher levels of oxygen in the environment are predicted to enhance tolerance of heat, whereas reductions in oxygen are expected to reduce <b>thermal</b> <b>limits.</b> Here, we extend previous research on <b>thermal</b> <b>limits</b> and oxygen limitation in aquatic insect larvae and directly test the hypothesis of increased anaerobic metabolism and lower energy status at thermal extremes. We quantified metabolite profiles in stonefly nymphs under varying tem-peratures and oxygen levels. Under normoxia, the concept of oxygen limitation applies to the insects studied. Shifts in the metabolome of heat-stressed stonefly nymphs clearly indicate the onset of anaerobic metabolism (e. g., accumulation of lactate, acetate, and alanine), a perturbation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (e. g., accumulation of succinate and malate), {{and a decrease in}} energy status (e. g., ATP), with corresponding decreases in their ability to survive heat stress. These shifts were more pronounced under hypoxic conditions, and negated by hyperoxia, which also improved heat tolerance. Perturbations of metabolic pathways in response to either heat stress or hypoxia were found to be somewhat similar but not identical. Under hypoxia, energy status was greatly compromised at thermal extremes, but energy shortage an...|$|R
