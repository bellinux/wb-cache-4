5|$|The nuclear lamina is {{composed}} mostly of lamin proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later {{transported to the}} nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina. Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as emerin and nesprin, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the nucleoplasmic veil, that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of <b>the</b> <b>veil</b> is not clear, although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase. Lamin structures that make up <b>the</b> <b>veil,</b> such as LEM3, bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{separating}} the 'veiling' continuum often present in T Tauri stars from the underlying photospheric spectrum is described. Echelle observations from 5100 to 6800 A of <b>the</b> partially <b>veiled</b> T Tauri star BP Tau were analyzed {{to determine the}} shape of <b>the</b> <b>veiling</b> spectrum. <b>The</b> residuals of the fit indicate the deviation of <b>the</b> <b>veiling</b> spectrum from a simple continuum and identify the location and strength of any emission-line components. It is shown, by means of goodness-of-fit tests, that the spectrum of BP Tau can be decomposed into a normal stellar spectrum plus a smooth veiling continuum {{with only a few}} emission lines superposed. The continuum dominates <b>the</b> <b>veiling</b> spectrum in this spectral region; <b>the</b> <b>veiling</b> does not arise from numerous deep photospheric absorption lines that are filled in by weak emission...|$|R

5|$|Inocybe maculata {{is similar}} to the {{variable}} Inocybe lacera, the split fibrecap, but it can be differentiated by the darker colouration of the cap, and the white remains of <b>the</b> <b>veil</b> in the centre of the cap.

It is closely related to Inocybe fastigiata, but can again be distinguished by colour; I.fastigiata has lighter coloured fibrils.|$|E
5|$|Lutheran theologian Rudolf Bultmann {{proposed}} that the Bible contains existential content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought to find the existential truths behind <b>the</b> <b>veil</b> of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'. Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language with personal import, the latter of which commands obedience. He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, which seeks to provide humans with self-understanding. Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could be overcome by demythologising the Bible, a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the word of God.|$|E

Christie was initially sceptical, but Roeg felt it would not make sense for the character to be heartbroken if she believed her husband and daughter were together in the afterlife.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This work aims {{to analyse}} within a {{rigorous}} framework, veiling, visual extinction and excess extraction from the spectra of T Tauri stars. We investigate further {{the method of}} Hartigan et al. (1989) for veiling estimate from small spectral bandwidth of a few tens of Angstroms. <b>The</b> calculated <b>veiling</b> value is sensitive to the estimated noise ratio and to spectral mismatches between the object and the reference. We show that an incorrect input noise ratio together with low contrast spectra in noise units can lead to important biasses and we propose solutions to minimize this problem. In case of spectral mismatches and for large contrast spectra compared to the residual of <b>the</b> <b>veiling</b> equation, <b>the</b> relative <b>veiling</b> bias is dominated by <b>the</b> apparent <b>veiling</b> of <b>the</b> reference {{with respect to the}} correct underlying object stellar spectrum. <b>The</b> <b>veiling</b> error is found to be proportional to the square of <b>the</b> <b>veiling</b> when <b>the</b> latte...|$|R
5|$|The woman {{wears an}} elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur {{at the neck}} and wrist. Her clothes are of the then-fashionable Burgundian style, which emphasises the tall and thin {{aesthetic}} of the Gothic ideal. Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of the pins pushed into <b>the</b> <b>veil</b> to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{left ear}} is set, {{according}} to art historian Norbert Schneider, unnaturally high and far back, parallel {{to her eyes}} rather than to her nose; this position is probably an artistic device used to continue {{the flow of the}} diagonal line of the veil's inner-right wing. In the 15th century, veils were normally worn for modesty, to hide the sensuality of the flesh. In this work <b>the</b> <b>veil</b> has the opposite effect; the woman's face is framed by the headdress to draw attention to her beauty.|$|E

Slipping away from the visiting party, Broadhead attempts to get inside one of the large domes that dominate the skyline. Quatermass later finds him dying, covered in a poisonous black slime.|$|E

5|$|Amanita muscaria is {{the type}} species of the genus. By extension, {{it is also the}} type species of Amanita {{subgenus}} Amanita, as well as section Amanita within this subgenus. Amanita subgenus Amanita includes all Amanita with inamyloid spores. Amanita section Amanita includes the species which have very patchy universal veil remnants, including a volva that is reduced to a series of concentric rings and <b>the</b> <b>veil</b> remnants on the cap to a series of patches or warts. Most species in this group also have a bulbous base. Amanita section Amanita consists of A.muscaria and its close relatives, including A.pantherina (the panther cap), A.gemmata, A.farinosa, and A.xanthocephala. Modern fungal taxonomists have classified Amanita muscaria and its allies this way based on gross morphology and spore inamyloidy. Two recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed this classification as natural.|$|E
5|$|In 677 or 678, Wilfrid and Ecgfrith quarrelled, and Wilfrid was {{expelled}} from his see. Abbess Hilda of Whitby was a leader in a faction of the Northumbrian church that disliked Wilfrid, and her close ties with Theodore helped to undermine Wilfrid's position in Northumbria. Another contributory factor in Wilfrid's expulsion was his encouragement of Æthelthryth's entry into a nunnery; he had personally given her <b>the</b> <b>veil,</b> the ceremony of entering a nunnery, on her retirement to Ely Abbey. Æthelthryth had donated the lands Wilfrid used to found Hexham Abbey, and the historian N. J. Higham argues {{that they had been}} part of the queen's dower lands, which, when Ecgfrith remarried, his new queen wanted to recover. The historian Eric John feels that Wilfrid's close ties with the Mercian kingdom also contributed to his troubles with Egfrith, although John points out that these ties were necessary for Wilfrid's monastic foundations, some of which were in Mercia. Wilfrid not only lost his diocese, he lost control of his monasteries as well.|$|E
5|$|In Act I, the Shard-bearer's story resumes {{after the}} defeat of the King of Shadows. The player awakens alone in an {{underground}} barrow in Rashemen, where he meets Safiya, a Red Wizard of Thay. The player follows Safiya to <b>the</b> <b>Veil</b> Theater in the nearby town of Mulsantir, hoping to find Lienna, an acquaintance of Safiya’s mother, who is supposed to provide the player with some much-needed answers. Unfortunately, the player finds that the theater has been attacked by Red Wizards, and Lienna has been killed. At the back of the theater, the player finds a portal to the Plane of Shadow, a dark reflection of the Prime Material Plane, where he defeats the Red Wizards who murdered Lienna. Upon returning to the Prime Material Plane, the player finds that the spirit-god Okku has besieged Mulsantir, demanding the player’s blood. The player confronts Okku and defeats his spirit army. At the end of the battle, the player learns that he has become a spirit-eater, an accursed being who must feed upon feys and elementals (and sometimes mortal souls) in order to survive.|$|E

5|$|Royall and Marbury envisaged {{nuclear energy}} being {{controlled}} by experts, {{with a minimum}} of political interference. The commissioners would be appointed for indefinite terms, and the President's power to remove them would be limited. They would be supported by four advisory boards, for military applications, industrial uses, research and medicine, the membership of which would be restricted to those with technical qualifications. Day-to-day running of the organization would {{be in the hands of}} an administrator and his deputy. The Royall–Marbury Bill was reviewed by the Interim Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lifted <b>the</b> <b>veil</b> of secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project, Royall and Marbury were able to consult with the Attorney General, the Judge Advocate General and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The draft was sent to the President in August for circulation among, and comment from, affected government agencies. Only the State Department had objections, on the basis that it was still involved in trying to hammer out an international agreement on nuclear energy.|$|E
5|$|The crosier was {{displayed}} {{as a symbol}} of pastoral jurisdiction by bishops, abbots, abbesses, and cardinals even if they were not bishops. The crosier of a bishop is turned outward or to the right. Frequently the crosier of an abbot or abbess is turned inward, either toward the mitre or to the left, but this distinction is disputed and is not an absolute rule. Pope Alexander VII decreed in 1659 that the crosiers of abbots include a sudarium or veil, but this is not customary in English heraldry. <b>The</b> <b>veil</b> may have arisen because abbots, unlike bishops, did not wear gloves when carrying an actual crosier. Because the cross has similar symbolism, the crosier was suppressed for cardinals and bishops by the Catholic Church in 1969, and is now used only on some corporate arms, and the personal arms of abbots and some abbesses. In English custom and in the Anglican Churches, two crosiers are often found crossed in saltire behind the shield. In the Lutheran Church of Sweden, the crosier is displayed in the arms of bishops in office but is removed when a bishop retires.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws <b>the</b> <b>veil</b> of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E
