25|$|The pre-parade segment {{today may}} include mass-displays, choir {{performances}}, school band displays, sky-diving displays, and other light-hearted performances {{to entertain the}} crowd prior to the parade proper, with the added positive effect of encouraging parade-attendees to be seated earlier. Initially introduced on an ad-hoc basis as an informal filler, it has since became {{an integral part of}} the parade particularly when live television coverage was extended to this segment in recent years. As audience participation has become a part of the parade, the pre-parade segment also becomes an opportunity for the hosts to lead and rehearse with the audience actions they may have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> parade proper begins.|$|E
25|$|Upon graduation, {{one of the}} {{following}} degrees is obtained, according to the university: Doctor of Medicine, or both Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Surgery. Public universities usually confer both degrees, and private universities bestow only Doctor of Medicine. In daily practice, however, there is no substantial difference between what a Doctor of Medicine or a Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Surgery are allowed <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> degree is obtained, a record is created for that new doctor in the index of the National Ministry of Education (Ministerio Nacional de Educación) and the physician is given their corresponding medical practitioner's ID, which is a number that identifies him and his academic achievements. In addition, there is a provincial ID, i. e. a number to identify doctors in the province they practise medicine in.|$|E

[...] Scott Schetler from AOL Radio Blog noted how Diddy referenced a different popular song in each verse. Lamb particularly noted the strong autobiographical lyrics, and the references to the 1979 hit song [...] "Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now" [...] by McFadden & Whitehead. Other songs referenced include Dionne Warwick's [...] "A House Is Not a Home" [...] (1964) and Smokey Robinson & the Miracles' [...] "The Tears of a Clown" [...] (1970). Rodriguez said [...] "Diddy do some soul-searching in his rhymes as the chorus echoes his need for salvation." ...|$|E

Similarly, a reviewer from Billboard commented that the project was [...] "a nicely varied, wholly satisfying collection". Chris Heat of Dotmusic praised Britney for [...] "us this opportunity to take the odd risk and adds a welcome edge to her sound." [...] NMEs Ted Kessler recognized the release as a [...] "coming of age album" [...] and joked that it [...] "works best when making a good pop cheese and dance sandwich". By contrast, Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club panned the album, opining that the music [...] "just [...] catchy" [...] and that [...] "though neither a girl nor a woman, Spears inspires grown-up anger on her own". Craig Seymore of Spin recognized that she [...] "sound almost human," [...] but criticized that [...] "the rest of the record is as coldly anthemic as ever." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{eleventh}} studio album, Get Lucky (February 1990) {{made the}} top60 in Australia – their last charting studio album in Australia. Mike Boehm of Los Angeles Times caught their gig in May, where [...] "Lead singer Glenn Shorrock was stiff and seemed stuck for words between songs. But {{he knew what}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> music started, singing in a comfortably husky voice that resembled Phil Collins in tone and easy pop appeal. Wayne Nelson, the group's Californian, generated more heat in his two lead vocal turns. The three-part harmonies behind Shorrock were exemplary, although the CS parallels were unmistakable. Lead guitarist Stephen Housden reinforced the emphasis on melody with his clean, lyrical lines." ...|$|E
2500|$|Skateboarding, {{as we know}} it, was {{probably}} born sometime in the late 1940s, or early 1950s, when surfers in California wanted something <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> waves were flat. This was called [...] "sidewalk surfing" [...] - {{a new wave of}} surfing on the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became highly popular. No one knows who made the first board; it seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time. The first manufactured skateboards were ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant to be used by surfers in their downtime. The shop owner, Bill Richard, made a deal with the Chicago Roller Skate Company to produce sets of skate wheels, which they attached to square wooden boards. Accordingly, skateboarding was originally denoted [...] "sidewalk surfing" [...] and early skaters emulated surfing style and maneuvers, and performed barefoot.|$|E
2500|$|The District of Columbia {{successfully}} opened W Street NW through cemetery {{land in a}} {{far less}} divisive way in 1907. [...] The effort to open the street began in January 1903, when the city decided to open W Street NW between 2nd Street NW and North Capitol Street. [...] This would have effectively divided the cemetery's land west of North Capitol Street into equal north and south portions. Congress, however, provided no funds to obtain {{the land and the}} city would not initiate eminent domain proceedings. Instead, the city requested that the land be donated, which the cemetery declined <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> city next raised the issue, a year later, the city's legal counsel said the land must be condemned because the cemetery's charter did not allow it to alienate land. Subsequently, a bill was introduced in Congress in February 1904 to pay Prospect Hill Cemetery $5,000 for the necessary land.|$|E

2500|$|Going into season three, the Smallville crew {{wanted to}} {{establish}} two main themes, {{which were the}} consequences of Clark running from his destiny, and Lex taking steps toward [...] "the dark side". One of the consequences the creative team attempted to show for Clark was his distancing himself from his friends. Season three was also about showing just how evil Lionel is – illustrated by how he attempts to destroy Chloe’s life and make Lex {{believe that he is}} going insane. In order to get better performances from the actors in each individual episode, the crew would often limit the detail an actor knew about their character. Meeting just {{at the beginning of the}} year to discuss the plans for the actor’s respective roles, usually the actors would only find out precisely what their characters were going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> scripts arrived. Other times, an actor might be given a specific piece of character development and told to keep it a secret from the rest of the cast.|$|E

Janeway and Seven disagree once more in [...] "The Omega Directive" [...] about what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> ship detects unstable Omega particles nearby.

Seven must later deal with a series of hallucinations and loneliness while helping the crew cross a radiation filled nebula in [...] "". This experience results in her seeking out the company of other crew members more frequently. Her suspicions of Arturis prove correct in [...] "Hope and Fear" [...] when it is revealed that he was seeking revenge on the Voyager crew for their previous alliance with the Borg by creating a fake USS Dauntless and attempting to take them back to Borg space where they would be assimilated.|$|E
