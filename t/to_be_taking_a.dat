5|$|Pick's {{interest}} in design {{led to his}} involvement in the founding, in 1915, of the Design and Industries Association. The organisation aimed to bring manufacturers and designers together {{to improve the quality of}} industrial design. Through his improvements in the UERL's advertising and branding, Pick was considered by many of its members <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> practical lead in achieving the organisation's aims and he was soon lecturing on the subject, giving talks during 1916 and 1917 at the Art Workers Guild in London, at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh and elsewhere. After the First World War, Pick continued to give talks regularly and published articles on design. He also began to set out his ideas on reconstruction and town planning, an area of design he became interested in through its connection to transport planning. He wrote and lectured extensively on this subject during the 1920s and 1930s including presenting a 14,000 word paper to the Institute of Transport in 1927 and addressing the International Housing and Town Planning Congress in 1939. Concerned about the uncontrolled and unchecked growth of London, partly facilitated by the new lines that London Underground was building, Pick was a strong supporter of the need for a green belt around the capital to maintain open space within reach of urban areas.|$|E

He argued for representing truth in language, and honesty was of paramount importance. Even in facial expression, truth must always be represented. Confucius believed that if a ruler is to lead correctly, by action, that orders would be unnecessary in that others will follow the proper actions of their ruler. In discussing {{the relationship between a}} king and his subject (or a father and his son), he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors. This demanded that the subordinates must advise their superiors if the superiors are considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> course of action that is wrong. Confucius believed in ruling by example, if you lead correctly, orders by force or punishment are not necessary.|$|E

Abnett said, [...] "Hercules {{is going to get}} involved more on a personal level in terms of his individual friendships with people rather than specifically taking a side because he objects to the whole thing anyway. He doesn't want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> side."

This departure was reported {{at the time as}} amicable, with Noel stating that Arthurs wanted {{to spend more time with}} his family. Arthurs' statement clarified his leaving as [...] "to concentrate on other things". However, Noel has since offered a contradicting version: that a series of violations of Noel's [...] "no drink or drugs" [...] policy (imposed by Noel so that Liam could sing properly) for the album's sessions resulted in a confrontation between the two. Two weeks later the departure of bassist Paul McGuigan was announced. The Gallagher brothers held a press conference shortly thereafter where they assured reporters that [...] "the future of Oasis is secure. The story and the glory will go on." ...|$|E
500|$|Yahoo! Voices {{wrote that}} Stevens [...] {{in the third}} season [...] "has become more condescending and passive {{aggressive}} herself, more than anyone else." [...] Heigl was critical of her character's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George, which she deemed [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time {{with that kind of}} thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now. She's changed a lot." [...] Attempting to rationalise Izzie's actions, Heigl later assessed that: People who are so infallible, perfect and moral tend {{to be the first to}} slip and fall. But I would love to see how she deals with the consequences of what she's done, because what’s interesting is when people make decisions that shake their world, they suddenly have to go, 'Woo, I didn't know I was capable of this.' I'd like to see Izzie take some culpability.|$|E
500|$|Knight felt a {{parallel}} to George in that his [...] "confidence isn't always at its absolute highest", but overall he sees more differences than similarities. However, when the actor starts {{to think he}} is so different from O'Malley, an awkward move can suggest otherwise. [...] "I was walking, doing a scene with Katherine Heigl. I finished my line with her, and then I walked straight into the light stand." [...] Critical of her affair with O'Malley, Knight's co-star Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time {{with that kind of}} thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it." [...] Speaking of O'Malley's relationship with Lexie, Rhimes offered her insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They're really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater." [...] When asked what his [...] "favorite George moment" [...] was, Knight said his relationships with Stevens and Bailey.|$|E

The soap opera issued a casting call for Jill, describing her as [...] "late '50s, Caucasian, female. This [...] woman is a smart and confident CEO of a successful company. She is a mother and grandmother who wants what is best for her family." [...] However, soon after, Walton was able to sign a new contract to continue her portrayal of Jill. She later clarified her departure as having to do with [...] "family and this economy". She stated: [...] "I felt so bad that so many people have lost their jobs, that, all of a sudden, I thought: 'This is really silly. I have a wonderful job and I really think I owe it to myself and my family to continue on.'" [...] In February 2012, Walton signed a new contract with the soap opera, which would continue her portrayal of the role for an unspecified amount of time. The actress was then announced <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> leave of absence beginning that April, slated to last six months. [...] She made her return on November 2, 2012.

500|$|Forbes {{spoke about}} the commendable ticket pricing ensued by Live Nation for the tour. Jesse Lawrence from the {{magazine}} noticed how the ticket prices were lowered {{to an average of}} $68 in Gaga's primary markets and ensuing fast sell-outs, compared to those of her contemporaries, like Miley Cyrus' Bangerz Tour which had an average ticket price at $86. Conversely, the average price was raised to as high as $269 in Gaga's secondary markets, although with fewer tickets available than Cyrus' tour. This again ensued that the revenue was earned with profit. Lawrence concluded by saying that [...] "Lady Gaga's pricing, seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> longer-term view and is focused on providing access to as many of her fans as possible as opposed to wringing out every last dollar on the current tour." [...] In April 2014, Lawrence reported that following Gaga's performance at Roseland Ballroom, the tour ticket prices in the secondary markets went up by 5.3%, with major increases being visible at Philips Arena in Atlanta. Tickets at Madison Square Garden rose up to $338.81, which was 42.6% higher than the average price. Other locations where ticket prices saw an increase were MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, TD Garden Arena in Boston and United Center in Chicago. A higher price was set for the first of two nights at Staples Center in Los Angeles, resulting in one of the costliest tickets in the show. The pricing was leveled off for the second night and they gradually decreased with the tour's progress. This was evident in the tour date switch up between May 12 and 15 at Washington and Philadelphia, respectively, where the ticket prices fell by 29.5%.|$|E

I have a really hard time {{with that kind of}} thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now." [...] Former The Star-Ledger columnist Alan Sepinwall expressed a negative perspective on the episode, deeming it childish and ridiculous. He disliked Rhimes' conception of the story arc involving Stevens, elaborating, [...] "If there's a doctor on this show who should be forced to repeat their intern year, if only to prevent them from being allowed to influence younger doctors, it's Izzie, not George. She proves her unfitness for this role with her first patient of the day, the deer. Not cute, not character-illuminating, just dumb." [...] Also criticized was Torres, whose regression from a [...] "cool, rocking, outgoing, cofident and full of life" [...] role was highlighted, receiving negative feedback from Sepinwall, who wrote [...] "Now the character exists entirely so the writers can dump on her, in a devolution far worse than anything. I just don't get it, and it pains me to watch any scene with Callie in it. Despite expressing a negative outlook on Meredith's story arc which dealt with Shepherd, noting that the [...] "constant break-ups and reunions are as silly as if Shonda Rhimes had just kept them apart for three seasons before letting them kiss", Sepinwall was favorable of Lexie's arrival at Seattle Grace, feeling that [...] "she's still being written as Meredith circa season one in an attempt to make us like her, but I didn't mind the manipulation, if only because there are so few characters left on this show to like." [...] The Buzzsugar television reviewer was mainly critical of the episode, describing it as a departure from [...] "the old show".

Chang also noted the little screen time of characters Mark Sloan and Richard Webber, and the lack of romantic development in their storylines. Many critics negatively reviewed Izzie Stevens's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George. Katherine Heigl herself deemed their relationship [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn’t seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing.

[...] Laura Burrows of IGN stated the series became [...] "a little more than mediocre, but less than fantastic" [...] in its fourth season. She also said that [...] "this season proved that even strong chemistry and good acting cannot save a show that suffers from the inevitable recycled plot." [...] However, the episode [...] "Physical Attraction, Chemical Reaction" [...] received a positive review, with Burrows stating that it [...] "fully encompassed all the things that make this show great: intense emotional drama and macabre OR activities". The Derek/Rose relationship received negative reviews, with Burrows stating that it was [...] "emotional, but not remarkable". Jack Florey of IndieLondon reviewed the characters, stating that their behaviour is the show's biggest problem: [...] "the self-absorbed, pretentious and frequently selfish attitudes that drive the surgeons at the centre of Grey’s exasperate more than reward." [...] As for the storylines, Foley stated that they didn't [...] "ring true" [...] and that [...] "the plot devices became increasingly clunky", noting the lack of realism in arcs such as George and Callie's marriage and the Izzie's affair [...] "as a means of ripping it apart". Florrey also commented on Meredith Grey's arc, by stating that she turned into [...] "one of the most selfish, self-centered characters on television", whereas Mark Sloan's storyline was named [...] "sex-obsessed, borderline misogynistic and close to scandalous". Daniel Fienberg of Zap2It said [...] "One of the season's best performances came from Emmy-nominated guest star Elizabeth Reaser." [...] Pajiba TV reviewed Reaser's performance by stating that it [...] "has been one of the only good things that show's had going for it anymore." [...] Entertainment Weekly called Reaser's performance as Ava the sixth most memorable patient performance on the show.
