50|$|Tuna and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes</b> {{are highly}} migratory, and stocks cross {{numerous}} international boundaries. ICCAT {{is involved in}} management of 30 species, including the Atlantic bluefin (Thunnus thynnus thynnus), yellowfin (T. albacares), albacore (T. alalunga) and bigeye tuna (T. obesus); from the billfishes, swordfish (Xiphias gladius), white marlin (Tetrapturus albidus), blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), sailfish (Istiophorus albicans); mackerels such as spotted Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus) and king mackerel (S. cavalla); and, small tunas like skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis).|$|E
5000|$|White marlin feed on {{a variety}} of {{schooling}} baitfish, including sardine, herring, and other clupeoids; squid; mackerel; scad; saury; and smaller <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes,</b> such as frigate and bullet tuna. Like their close relatives the striped marlin, and sailfish, white marlin will often group together to corral schooling baitfish into a tight group for feeding purposes, a phenomenon commonly referred to as [...] "balling bait". When this occurs, it is common for two or more fish to be raised to the baits or hooked up simultaneously.|$|E
5000|$|Lakshadweep {{comprises}} the only coral atolls of the country. With a vast lagoon of 4,200 km2, it has territorial waters of 20,000 km2, Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of 4,00,000 lakh (400,000 km2) and coastal line of about 132 km. There is an estimation {{of about one}} lakh tonnes (...) of tuna and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes</b> and about an equal quantity of shark in the sea around Lakshadweep. Fishing is the main livelihood of the islanders. Freshly caught tuna is processed by drying it in the sun after cooking and smoking. The resultant product, known as 'mas', are popular products exported from these islands to southeast Asian countries. Eleven workshops in islands and two boat building yards cater {{to the needs of}} fishermen. There are 375 boats in operation in Lakshadweep.|$|E
40|$|A brief {{account is}} given {{of the early}} {{development}} of the Indonesian skipjack fishery. The skipjack industry in Indonesia {{has the potential to}} expand tremendously, especially since the skipjack stock is underutilised and there Is an increasing demand for the raw material in world markets. A review of the methods of fishing for skipjack indicated that the pole-and-line method appears to be the best means for harvesting this resource in Indonesian waters. However, problems relating to the availability, abundance,and hardiness of baitfish must be overcome before the fishery can be expanded to its maximum. Experimental pole-and-line fishing trials and surveys carried out on modern skipjack vessels have indicated a bright prospect {{for the development of a}} skipjack fishery, particularly in the eastern park of the Indonesian waters. The total landings of tuna and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fish</b> from the Indonesian waters is estimated at around 30, 000 tons annually. Classified according to the conditions of the Indonesia...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{increase}} of the world demand for tuna-processed products needs to be balanced with tuna and tuna-fish like sustainability in their environment. Sustainable management system is needed to increase the production of tuna processing industry by still preserving its sustainability. This problem became more complex, due to the dynamic nature of ecosystems and other processes involved. This study developed a system dynamics model which integrates tuna stocks ecosystem, tuna processing industry development, social economic, and policy sub-models. This model was developed based on historical data, then developed into three development scenarios: without fish-catch limitation, limitation by Sustainable Maximum yield (MSY) and limitation by Maximum economic yield (MEY). System dynamic modeling was conducted to analyze sustainable tuna industry development based on various points of view, to accommodate stakeholder interest. The success of tuna processing industry development, were assessed from the {{increase of}} production values, the preservation of tuna and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fish</b> stock in the environment, and also the improvement of social welfare. Simulations were carried out for 25 years to predict the condition of fish stocks in the future, based on current policies applied. Simulation results show that to develop tuna processing industry while maintaining the stock of tuna in its sustainable conditions, only limiting the fish catch was not enough, the process of integrating industry, socioeconomic and policy made by related institutions were also important...|$|R
50|$|Blue marlin are eclectic feeders {{preying on}} a wide range of prey species and sizes. Scientific {{examination}} of blue marlin stomach contents has yielded organisms as small as miniature filefish. Common food items include <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes,</b> particularly skipjack tuna and frigate mackerel (also known as frigate tuna), squid, mackerel, and scad. Of more interest to sport fishermen is the upper range of blue marlin prey size. A 72 in white marlin has been recorded as being found in the stomach of a 448 lb blue marlin caught at Walker's Cay in the Bahamas, and more recently, during the 2005 White Marlin Open, a white marlin in the 70 lb class was found in the stomach of one of the money-winning blues. Shortbill spearfish of 30 to 40 lb have been recorded as feed items by Kona blue marlin fishermen. Yellowfin and bigeye tuna of 100 lb or more have also been found in the stomachs of large blue marlin.|$|E
40|$|Tuna {{fisheries}} in India have undergone {{significant changes in}} recent years. Though the coastal multi-species fishery is the mainstay for harvesting tunas and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes,</b> targeted fishery for exploiting the high value tunas is emerging. Awareness has been created among the stakeholders that the continental shelf resources {{are more or less}} fully utilized and that further avenue for development lies in harvesting the oceanic tuna stocks. Fishing capacity from the shelf fishery is being diverted, with appropriate modifications, for harvesting the oceanic tuna resources. The production of tunas and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes</b> has gone up to an all time high of 158, 458 tonnes during the year 2008, out of which 24. 2...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{represents}} the final {{portion of a}} series of descriptions of the tunas and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes</b> of the Pacific. It describes two species of bonito, the Peruvian and the Oriental, whose relationship to the two previously described species, the California and the Mexican, was obscure. One of the most abundant sources of protein food is found in the "Scombroid" group of fishes, including such fish as the tuna, skipjack, bonito and mackerel. These are streamlined, pelagic, schooling fishes distributed, in greater or less abundance, in almost every ocean of the world. Although widely distributed and generally similar in appearance, there is reason to suspect that in some instances individual species are confined to a given ocean or to a restricted portion of that ocean, and that the stocks of the world are made up of such distinct groups. In other instances it appears that species are in reality cosmopolitan. If our fishery resources are to be intelligently exploited, management will require a precise knowledge of the composition of the total stock and the geographical range of the component species. Such knowledge is the framework into which life history studies must be fitted. The recognition of larval and juvenile stages, the significance of spawning areas and nursery grounds become productive assets when properly correlated with individual species. The aggregate of such knowledge will provide another measure of abundance to guide those responsible for sustained exploitation. To this end numerous state and federal—domestic and foreign—research agencies have, within recent years, directed their concerted efforts to collecting the necessary information concerning the tunas and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes.</b> The information obtained from this study is presented as a further contribution towards the eventual understanding of the stocks of <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes</b> and the relationships of the stock from different areas...|$|E

40|$|Tuna and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes</b> are under-exploited {{resources}} of Indian EEZ. Exploitation of oceanic tuna and billfishes are possible only by longlining and purse seining. Existing {{deep sea fishing}} vessels in India are mostly trawlers equipped for bottom trawling for shrimps and fishes. Most of them are stem trawlers and few are double riggers. Hence the deck layout is not suitable for either longlining or purse seining. Both longlining and purse seining for oceanic tuna and billfishes are specialized techniques which require special onboard facilities, deck layout and deck machineries like line haulers, chute, shooting and hauling accessories for longlining and special powerful purse winch, power block etc. for tuna piu'se seining...|$|E
40|$|Tuna and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes</b> are {{important}} both from global demand and economic view points. They include 40 species {{occurring in the}} Atlantic, Indo-Pacific Oceans and in the Mediterranean Sea. Archaeological evidence showed that, tunas being harvested by early Europeans {{in the area around}} Sweden, by Native Americans near British Columbia and by the peoples of the Joman culture near Japan. However, industrial fishing for tunas began in the 1950 ’s and global production has tended to increase continuously from 0. 6 million tons in 1950 to over 6 million tons in 2008. Catch of principal market tuna species was estimated as four million tons in 2008, which represented about 67 per cent of the total catch of all tuna and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes.</b> Most of these catches were taken from the Pacific Ocean (70. 2 per cent), with the Indian Ocean contributing 20. 4 per cent with an estimated catch of 870, 000 tonnes and the rest by Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea (9. 5 per cent). Major contributors to the global tuna production are skipjack tuna (57. 5 per cent), followed by yellowfin tuna (27. 1 per cent), bigeye tuna (9. 6 per cent), albacore tuna (4. 7 per cent) and the rest (10. 7 per cent) by other species. According to assessments carried out during 2010 by ICCAT, IOTC, IATTC and WCPFC the international organizations responsible for management of the tuna stocks of in the world Oceans, many tuna stocks are heavily exploited, some unsustainably, and the catches in many cases are declining...|$|E

40|$|Tunas and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes</b> {{have contributed}} {{considerably}} towards {{the increase in}} fish production from Ceylon's coastal waters, during {{the last five years}} and in this blood fish group lies a potential resource for a further increase in production. Consequently considerable attention is being paid to the study of these species. Length frequency sampling of these species are being carried out and quite often it becomes necessary to convert catch in terms of weight to catch in terms of number, when estimating apparent abundance of the stock. The length-weight relationship in addition to its usefulness in converting length frequency data to weight frequency data for such purpose is of general value to biologists and even to fishermen. The six species studied are yellowfin tuna (Thunnus alacares, Bonneterre), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis, Linnaeus), mackerel tuna (Buthynnus affinis, Cantor), frigate mackerel (narrow corseleted Auxis thazard, Lacepede and broad corseleted A. rochie, Risso) and bonito (Saida orientalis, T&S) ...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern about {{sustaining}} global food resources {{to keep pace with the}} growing population and other demands to meet the challenges of 2000 A. D. and beyond. Fisheries is no exception. It is estimated that at the present level of consumption of fish, the requirement by 2000 A. D. will be about 100 million tonnes as against the present production of about 82 million tonnes. One of the components projected for filling up a part of this gap is the harvest of tuna and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes,</b> which stands today at about 3. 6 million tonnes and is projected to increase to over 8 million tonnes during the next decade. While optimistic estimates as to how to fill such a gap through increased production of pelagic and demersal fisheries, including tunas und cuphalopods and potential saving from past harvest loses and from aquaculture have been made, let us look at the scenario of Indian fisheries, particularly marine fisheries and more specifically tuna fisheries...|$|E
40|$|Tunas and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes</b> {{belong to}} 6 genera, viz., Thunnus, Katsuwonus, Euthynnus, Auxis (tribe Thunnini) and Sarda (bonitos) and Gymnosarda (tribe Sardini) {{of the family}} Scombridae. Tunas are among the largest, most {{specialized}} and commercially important of all fishes (Collette and Nauen, 1983). They are found in temperate and tropical oceans {{around the world and}} account for a major proportion of the world fishery products. Tunas are unique among fishes because they possess body temperature several degrees higher than the ambient waters and have high metabolic rates that enable them to exhibit extraordinary growth patterns. They have streamlined bodies and vary extensively in size, color and fin length. They are fast swimmers capable of traveling more than 48 km/h (Collette and Nauen, 1983), migratory and have few predators. They are the second most important item, next only to shrimps, in the world seafood trade and therefore form specifically targeted fisheries globally by nations such as France, Spain, Thailand, Taiwan, Korea, Japan and USA.

40|$|Apart from {{activities}} of some foreign-based vessels, commercial exploitation of pelagic fishery resources in Nigeria {{has been limited}} to inland and inshore waters. Estimated potential for the inshore pelagic fishery is 70, 000 - 90, 000 tonnes while the small pelagic resources in the near offshore as well as tuna and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes</b> further offshore have potentials of about 10, 000 metric tonnes each. Despite the abundance of tuna within and adjoining the Nigerian EEZ, and its importance in the international market, only foreign-flagged vessels take advantage. In addition, the inshore pelagic fisheries in Nigeria have for long remained underexploited. The most common processing method has remained the age-old traditional smoke-drying, which is inadequate resulting in colossal waste through denaturation and incessant infestations by insects and moulds among other causes. The use of modern smoking techniques coupled with effective distribution systems can undoubtedly reduce waste. However, these are often not within the reach of most artisanal processors. It is proposed that the organised private sector should invest on simple but proven processing equipment such as smoking kilns. The inshore pelagic fish species and other small fishes can sustain cottage canning industries sited in fishing villages/settlements while larger canning factories {{should be based on}} offshore resources. Modalities for successful investments are highlighted, while a major consideration is given to joint venture...|$|E
40|$|The {{first four}} years of the present decade has seen a concerted {{effort on the part}} of the {{government}} as well as the fishing industry to consider tuna resources of the Exclusive Economic Zone of India and contiguous high seas as potentially important. The report by Silas and Pillai (1982) entitled * Resources of" tunas and related species and their fisheries in the Indian Ocean' has gone a long way in dispelling inhibitions and reservations in many quarters on the availability of tuna resources and the need for developing a tuna harvesting strategy. Recent developments in purse seine fishing in some countries such as Seychelles have indicated the potentialities, but a depressing international market trend for tuna products is still stifling investment in this sector. One silverlining is that today at any fisheries conference or seminar in India, tuna is discussed as a potentially important resource. While for over two decades the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute has tried to focus attention on this important resoiwce, the Institute itself has been pursuing with limited facilities, research programmes on tuna and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes.</b> The research results embodied in this publication was initiated by me in 1976, as a major project programme at the Institute and gradually built up for critically examining the coastal species of tuna stocks, their biology and fisheries...|$|E
40|$|Dolphinfish are {{targeted}} throughout the Western Central Atlantic region by recreational fishers, small-scale artisanal fishers, and small longliners. They are also taken as by-catch on large-scale commercial longlines. Catches are highly seasonal and exhibit considerable interannual variability. According {{to the landing}} statistics provided by countries to FAO, dolphinfish ranked seventh overall in reported average annual landings of large pelagic fishes in the Western Central Atlantic from 1989 to 1993. Yellowfin tuna, Spanish mackerel, skipjack tuna, king mackerel, swordfish and Atlantic bonito ranked ahead of dolphinfish. There is a trend of increasing total annual landings from about 1, 700 mt in 1970 - 74 to about 2, 800 mt in 1989 - 1993. Landings are reported to FAO by only eight countries, whereas dolphinfish {{are known to be}} caught in most of the region´s 34 countries. By-catch on longlines and recreational landings are also largely unreported. Therefore, {{it is likely that the}} reported landings are a substantial underestimate. The relative importance of dolphinfish to pelagic fisheries varies from one part of the region to another. In the Lesser Antilles it is the most important large pelagic fish in terms of amounts landed. The absence of a large-scale commercial fishery targeting dolphinfish appears to have resulted in a lack of recognition of its contribution, particularly in developing countries of the region. Consequently, its biology and assessment have been neglected in relation to the attention given to other large pelagic fishes, mainly tunas and <b>tuna-like</b> <b>fishes</b> which have been the focus of ICCAT assessment activities...|$|E
