5|$|From 21 April 2001, Live & Kicking began {{broadcasting}} from BBC Scotland in Glasgow and saw Farley, Cawood and Deley {{joined by}} Heather Suttie who replaced Hill. The set remained <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>after</b> having been transported up to Glasgow from London, however a new seating area was added, consisting of pouffes and beanbags. The {{feel of the}} show also changed and was also split into three sections. The first hour became Kicking Toons which bunched all the cartoons together, the next hour would feature {{the main components of}} Live & Kicking including the games and sketches and the final hour became Live & Loud which featured all the music performances.|$|E
5|$|Kubica {{dropped to}} 13th as his {{traction}} control fault worsened, and a train of cars {{that wanted to}} pass developed behind him. Kovalainen's performance was much better than at the previous round in Melbourne, and he attempted to pass Jarno Trulli for eighth. The top five again remained <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>after</b> {{the second round of}} stops. However, Hamilton's short first stop necessitated a relatively early second stop, allowing Räikkönen to reduce the gap and Alonso to extend his lead to 18 seconds. Nico Rosberg, running in sixth place after the stops, was forced to retire with hydraulic problems on lap 43. David Coulthard also retired after problems with his brake pedal, the same problem that he experienced in the Friday practice session.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race, one on Friday and two on Saturday. The first session lasted 90 minutes, the second 45 minutes {{and the third}} 60 minutes. In the first practice session, Kyle Busch was fastest {{with a time of}} 30.009 seconds; Jeff Gordon was second and Johnson third. Stewart took fourth, and David Reutimann was placed fifth. Dale Earnhardt Jr., Edwards, Elliott Sadler, Kurt Busch, and Jeremy Mayfield rounded out the session's top ten fastest drivers. Hornish made contact with the turn-two barrier, while Reed Sorenson and Patrick Carpentier spun in turn-four but avoided damaging their cars. Montoya switched to a back-up car after heavily colliding with the turn-two wall, and Bobby Labonte did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>after</b> he lost control in turn-four and damaged his left-rear quarter. Kahne made light contact with the turn-four wall, repaired by his team.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Naval College exams for {{navigating}} lieutenant and lieutenant were <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>after</b> 1869. By 1872 {{the number}} of navigating cadets had fallen to twelve, and an Admiralty experiment in 1873 under the First Sea Lord George Goschen further merged the duties of navigating lieutenants and sailing masters with those of lieutenants and staff commanders. There were no more masters warranted after 1883, {{and the last one}} retired in 1892.|$|E

25|$|After B-And-B, Kelly had few {{television}} roles {{although she}} did appear in episodes of Hawaii Five-O, Pearl, the 1977 film Lust of a Eunuch and an episode of Magnum, P.I. in 1981. In 1983 she {{took part in a}} revival of What's My Line?. This ran for three years, although Kelly, who thought that the original show was never <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>after</b> the death of Gilbert Harding in 1960, felt that the revival did not match it either.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Nakagawa {{sustained}} a serious injury surveying {{the grounds of}} Ryutaku-ji from the view of a treetop. He slipped on a branch and was left unconscious for three days where he had fallen before being found. He was discovered in a bed of bamboo reeds unexpectedly {{by one of his}} monks.

25|$|The two teams' total ratings {{is almost}} exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>after</b> the series (119.4+90.5=209.9) as before the series (120+90=210). The series has {{therefore}} not generated any extra ratings, but has just redistributed the ratings {{the two teams}} already had. When these ratings are published in the official table in their rounded form (119 and 91), the total ratings after the series will be {{exactly the same as}} before the series. There is therefore no points 'inflation' in this system, which means that comparisons of ratings over time are meaningful.|$|E
25|$|In 2003–04 it {{was more}} of <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> <b>After</b> an assured {{performance}} in the Pool stage, Munster defeated Stade Français at Thomond Park to set up a semi-final date with English champions, London Wasps. This match has gone down {{as one of the best}} Heineken Cup matches of all time. Although leading by 10 points in the second half, and having lost Ronan O'Gara to injury early on, they succumbed to 2 Wasps tries in injury time, resulting in a Wasps v Toulouse final. Munster finished in a disappointing seventh position in the 2003–04 season of the Celtic League.|$|E
25|$|On 28 July 2017, Sharif {{was barred}} from public office by the Supreme Court of Pakistan {{for a period}} of 10 years. He was also put on the Exit Control List to prevent his {{departure}} from the country—in order for the NAB to continue investigation for corruption charges against Sharif and his three children, Mariam, Hussain and Hassan. Sharif submitted his resignation after the ruling. Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had a history of launching strong tirades against ‘container politics’. However, he himself is all set to do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>after</b> he was disqualified by Supreme Court of Pakistan in the Panama Papers case, vehemently criticizing the apex court and its ruling.|$|E

25|$|Later in 1845, he {{accepted}} the presidency of Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois. The school had recently been opened by anti-slavery social reformers who sought a Christian utopia. The school was deeply in debt but, thanks to donations by Charles E. Phelps and J. P. Williston, Blanchard was able to secure financial stability. The Old Main building, now recognized as a National Historic Landmark, was constructed during his tenure. When Senator Stephen A. Douglas assisted {{with the passage of}} the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, Blanchard harshly criticized him in a newspaper article. He would do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>after</b> Douglas' support for the Kansas–Nebraska Act. The two met in Knoxville, Illinois on October 13, 1854 to publicly debate the issues. In 1855, Blanchard went on a lecture circuit of Kentucky with fellow abolitionists Cassius Marcellus Clay and John Gregg Fee.|$|E
25|$|On 10 October 1846, General Taylor {{caught fire}} while lying at the wharf of the Pensacola Navy Yard, and was {{burned to the}} water's edge. She was {{redesigned}} by F. Grice and rebuilt by G. Lyndal of Baltimore, a new engine and boiler being supplied {{at the same time}} by Charles Reeder & Sons of the same city. The new 187hp engine was of the crosshead type, with a 36-inch bore, 6-foot stroke and steam cut-off of 3 feet. The new boiler had a greater fire surface area (720 vs. 499 square feet) than the original, and a slightly higher operating pressure of 25 psi. The paddlewheel diameter was also enlarged by a foot, and the number of paddles reduced by one to thirteen. The new machinery appears to have been less efficient than the original, consuming twice the fuel for only a one-half knot increase in maximum speed. General Taylors hull dimensions remained <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>after</b> the rebuild as before.|$|E
25|$|Opera {{would never}} be <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>after</b> Wagner and for many composers his legacy proved a heavy burden. On the other hand, Richard Strauss {{accepted}} Wagnerian ideas but took them in wholly new directions, along with incorporating the new form introduced by Verdi. He first won fame with the scandalous Salome and the dark tragedy Elektra, in which tonality was pushed to the limits. Then Strauss changed tack in his greatest success, Der Rosenkavalier, where Mozart and Viennese waltzes became as important an influence as Wagner. Strauss continued to produce a highly varied body of operatic works, often with libretti by the poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal. Other composers who made individual contributions to German opera in the early 20th century include Alexander von Zemlinsky, Erich Korngold, Franz Schreker, Paul Hindemith, Kurt Weill and the Italian-born Ferruccio Busoni. The operatic innovations of Arnold Schoenberg and his successors {{are discussed in the}} section on modernism.|$|E

25|$|In 1836, after {{abolishing the}} {{division}} into voivodeships in the Congress Poland, they {{were replaced by}} the guberniyas. During that time, the Royal Castle became the residence of the Tsar's governor Ivan Paskievich. Paskievich charged Ludvik Corio – a Russian Colonel and architect – with designing new elevations and facades (the west, south and east parts). However, Russian authorities were {{not satisfied with the}} new designs and Corio was told to prepare another design – one that would refer to Kubicki's solutions (and his co-workers Lelewel and Thomas). Finally, Corio rebuilt all the elevations and facades in the neoclassical style, but the Saxon Elevation was left <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> <b>After</b> the death of Paskievich in 1856, all the next governors resided in the Royal Castle's Chamberlain's Room. The Russian officials occupied rooms on both floors of the west and north wings of the castle. The governors were heavily guarded by the Russian army. Unfortunately, the living space that was assigned to these soldiers was the Parliamentary Hall, Library and barracks under the Castle. As a result, these were left devastated.|$|E
25|$|Kartikeyan {{qualified}} {{last for}} the following 5 races (bar in Spain where Lewis Hamilton was excluded from qualifying and in Monaco where Sergio Pérez crashed without setting a time) however Karthikeyan only started 24th and last twice (in Bahrain and Canada) due to other drivers picking up grid penalties. In China Karthikeyan finished 22nd, ahead of Caterham's Heikki Kovalainen. In Bahrain, Karthikeyan finished 21st and was classified ahead of the Williams of Bruno Senna who retired due to brake issues. In Spain Karthikeyan retired for the first race in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>after</b> a wheel nut failure on lap 22 due to a botched pit stop. In Monaco Karthikeyan started 22nd, ahead of Peréz and the penalised Pastor Maldonado and finished the race in 15th, classified ahead of McLaren's Jenson Button who retired after collision damage with Kovalainen (Karthikeyan also had his race quickest lap within 0.3 secs of Button). In Canada Karthikeyan retired {{for the second time}} in the season after suffering a brake failure on lap 22 which made him spin in turn 1 and stop later on in the lap, his teammate Pedro de la Rosa retire with a similar issue two laps later.|$|E
25|$|Sunday's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} held in the morning rather than starting at the traditional time of the beginning of the afternoon. Qualifying took place in dry and warm weather conditions. In the first group of five runners, Bird paced the session, ahead of Frijns. Prost and Piquet were third and fourth due to both drivers losing time through errors. Dvual had trouble selecting second gear, and ran deep into the first turn. He consequently finished as the first group's slowest competitor. Rosenqvist set a lap that immediately placed him the fastest driver in the second group, and finished in front of Turvey and Abt. D'Ambrosio and Félix da Costa were the second group's slowest participants. In the third group, Gasly set the fastest overall timed lap of any driver in the group stages at one minute and 2.080 seconds, and was one-tenth of a second faster than Vergne in second place. Di Grassi impacted the turn three exit barrier lightly en route to finishing third-fastest. Sarrazin and Evans finished the third group as its slowest competitors. In the fourth group, Heidfeld set a last minute lap time and his effort made him the fastest driver, ahead of Engel. Dillmann was third-fastest. After changing three car components, Lynn struggled with brake temperatures and could only muster fourth. Carroll was the fourth group's slowest driver following contact with the turn five exit barrier. At the end of group qualifying, the lap times set by Gasly, Rosenqvist, Vergne, Bird and Heidfeld were fast enough to enable them progression into super pole. Bird clinched pole position with a time of one minute and 2.285 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Rosenqvist who recorded a lap 0.037 seconds off Bird's pace. Vergne locked his tires at the hairpin, which disrupted his rhythm through the following corners, but recovered enough time to qualify in third. Gasly went wide at the turn one hairpin, restricting him to fourth. Heidfeld's attempt was untidy, and could only muster fifth place. After qualifying, Frijns was demoted ten places on the starting grid because he changed his gearbox following his practice accident, and Piquet did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>after</b> changing his engine.|$|E
