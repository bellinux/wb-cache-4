5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E
5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor {{in the air to}} condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the solar}} nebular disk model, rocky planets {{form in the}} inner part of the protoplanetary disk, within the frost line, where the {{temperature}} is high enough to prevent condensation of water ice and other substances into grains. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> in coagulation of purely rocky grains {{and later in the}} formation of rocky planetesimals.

After being informed by Abdul Sharif that Tariq has died, she agrees to marry Rasheed, a man eager to have a young and attractive second wife in hopes of having a son with her. When Laila gives birth to a daughter, Aziza, Rasheed is displeased and suspicious. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> in him becoming abusive towards Laila. Mariam and Laila eventually become confidants and best friends. They plan {{to run away from}} Rasheed and leave Kabul but are caught at the bus station. Rasheed beats them and deprives them of water for several days, almost killing Aziza.|$|E
5|$|Agnosticism is criticized from {{a variety}} of standpoints. Some {{religious}} thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to materialism. Some atheists criticize {{the use of the term}} agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism; <b>this</b> <b>results</b> in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label.|$|E
5|$|An {{increasing}} number of infected individuals are found to harbor antibiotic-resistant bacteria. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> in initial treatment failure and requires additional rounds of antibiotic therapy or alternative strategies, such as a quadruple therapy, which adds a bismuth colloid, such as bismuth subsalicylate.

5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} of childbearing age want to avoid {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{nearly half}} the {{hydrogen}} at the core has been consumed, with {{the remainder of the}} atoms consisting primarily of helium. As the number of hydrogen atoms per unit mass decreases, so too does their energy output provided through nuclear fusion. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> in a decrease in pressure support, which causes the core to contract until the increased density and temperature bring the core pressure into equilibrium with the layers above. The higher temperature causes the remaining hydrogen to undergo fusion at a more rapid rate, thereby generating the energy needed to maintain the equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st Century India’s health care system is {{strained}} {{in terms of the number}} of healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses. The health care system is also highly concentrated in urban areas. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> in many individuals in rural areas seeking care from unqualified providers with varying results. It has also been found that many individuals who claim to be physicians actually lack formal training. Nearly 25 percent of physicians classified as allopathic providers actually had no medical training; this phenomenon varies geographically.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{chemical}} structure, {{and their effects}} in humans are mainly produced by the allosteric modification of a specific kind of neurotransmitter receptor, the GABAA receptor, which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; <b>this</b> <b>results</b> in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines.

5|$|By contrast, {{the worker}} shares {{half of her}} genes with her sons and only a quarter with her brothers. Furthermore, the workers in colonies with a single once-mated queen are related to their nephews by three eighths, higher than they are related to brothers. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> in a {{conflict}} where the queen and worker females are at odds over the proportion of male offspring they contribute, since each side tries to maximize its reproductive fitness. Queens favor production of their own sons while workers favor production of their own sons, and do not stop their sisters from laying because of the favorable relatedness to nephews.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also binds to the hemeprotein myoglobin. It {{has a high}} {{affinity for}} myoglobin, about 60 times {{greater than that of}} oxygen. Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen. This causes reduced cardiac output and hypotension, which may result in brain ischemia. A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, because it {{is expected}} to have different electron charge densities from them. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 34.8g/cm3. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> from darmstadtium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough darmstadtium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
