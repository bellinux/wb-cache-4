W. Rice (of the Society for Marine Mammalogy) in [...] assumed was an ironic {{reference to the}} animals' great size. An alternate name for the parvorder is [...] "Mystacoceti" [...] (from Greek [...] "mustache" [...] + [...] "whale"), which, although obviously more appropriate and occasionally used in the past, has been superseded by [...] "Mysticeti" [...] (junior synonym).|$|E
500|$|The American {{theatrical}} debut was on 3 April 1991 in New York City by Carl Macek's Streamline Pictures, {{with the}} home release following in October 1992. Streamline's dub contains several deviations from the original Japanese script. Due to copyright issues with Maurice LeBlanc's estate, Lupin {{is referred to as}} [...] "the Wolf." [...] Inspector Koichi Zenigata is erroneously named [...] "Keibu Zenigata," [...] likely due to a <b>translation</b> <b>error</b> (keibu being the Japanese title for a police inspector). The UK release followed on 10 June 1996 by Manga Video. Optimum Releasing re-released Cagliostro in the UK after Manga Entertainment lost its license in the UK. The new DVD features an anamorphic widescreen print with the original Japanese audio track as well as the Streamline dub, both in stereo.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{above-mentioned}} print was leaked, {{it was released}} in Shanghai as a bootleg DVD with Chinese subtitles. The unknown producer of this DVD also chose to include English subtitles, which were in fact translated back into English from the Chinese translation, rather than using the original English script. This causes the subtitles to become heavily mis-translated, often causing unintentional humor. For example, in the opening crawl the title is mis-translated as Star War: The Third Gathers - Backstroke of the West. One error that recurs {{several times in the}} subtitles is that the phrase [...] "it seems" [...] (好象) was rendered as [...] "good elephant". [...] "Jedi Council" [...] is rendered as [...] "Presbyterian Church", and the mis-translation also caused the word [...] "fuck" [...] to replace [...] "work" [...] four times in the subtitles. Darth Vader's cry of [...] "Noooooooo!" [...] (不要) is rendered as [...] "Do not want". This last <b>translation</b> <b>error</b> would later be popularized as an internet meme. In 2016, a YouTube user named GratefulDeadpool uploaded a fan edit of Revenge of the Sith in which the cast's voices were dubbed to match the bootleg subtitles.|$|E

40|$|With {{the trend}} of {{economic}} globalization, more and more Chinese companies are using bilingual webpage as a new channel to penetrate into international markets. Online English corporate profiles play {{a very important role}} in the establishment of a company’s public image on international economic stages. However the quality of C-E translation is far from satisfactory as a result of ignoring target readers’ habit of expression and cultural differences, which has a negative impact on the penetration of Chinese products into international markets. Based on 24 authentic and reliable samples of corporate profiles, the paper analyzes the Chinese corporate profiles’ different features from that of companies of English speaking countries and classifies the <b>translation</b> <b>errors</b> into three categories: pragmatic <b>translation</b> <b>errors,</b> cultural <b>translation</b> <b>errors</b> and linguistic <b>translation</b> <b>errors.</b> Error samples and suggested versions are given to analyze the types and causes of errors. With the German functionalist approaches as its framework, the paper puts forward some strategies to avoid the <b>translation</b> <b>errors</b> and improve the C-E translation quality of Chinese corporate profiles.

Like intentional humour, accidental humour is also a combination of linguistics and culture-specific features, with humour generating devices (like words and phrases) embedded in it, and is just as competent in conveying humour.|$|R

The identified errors were classified into three main types: linguistic, comprehension and <b>translation</b> <b>errors.</b> They also revealed useful insights into methodological approaches, on how best to develop students’ awareness of their own types of <b>translation</b> <b>errors...</b>|$|R

They are more often symptoms of deeper issues with SMT models instead. ...|$|R
