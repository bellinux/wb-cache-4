5|$|Silviculture is the {{practice}} of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests, which are areas that have a high density of trees. Cultivated trees are planted and tended by humans, usually because they provide food (fruits or nuts), ornamental beauty, or some type of wood product that benefits people. An area of land planted with fruit or nut trees is an orchard. A small wooded area, usually with no undergrowth, is called a grove and a small wood or <b>thicket</b> <b>of</b> trees and bushes is called a coppice or copse. A large area of land covered with trees and undergrowth is called woodland or forest. An area of woodland composed primarily of trees established by planting or artificial seeding {{is known as a}} plantation.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{his release}} from prison in December 1984, Chikatilo found new work at a {{locomotive}} factory in Novocherkassk and kept a low profile. He did not kill again until 1 August 1985 when, {{on a business trip}} to Moscow, he encountered an 18-year-old woman, named Natalia Pokhlistova, at a railway platform near Domodedovo Airport. Pokhlistova was lured into a <b>thicket</b> <b>of</b> woods where she was bound, stabbed 38 times, then strangled to death. Based upon the hypothesis that the killer had travelled from the Rostov Oblast to Moscow via air, investigators checked all Aeroflot flight records of passengers who had commuted between Moscow and the Rostov Oblast between late July and early August. On this occasion, however, Chikatilo had travelled to Moscow by train and, accordingly, no documentation existed for investigators to research. Four weeks later, on 27 August, Chikatilo killed another young woman, Irina Gulyaeva, in Shakhty. As had been the case with Natalia Pokhlistova, the wounds inflicted upon the victim linked her murder to the hunt for the serial killer.|$|E
25|$|As {{the larger}} temple {{dedicated}} to the king, the hypostyle hall or pronaos is supported by six pillars; in this case, however, they are not Osiris pillars depicting the king, but are decorated with scenes with the queen playing the sistrum (an instrument sacred to the goddess Hathor), together with the gods Horus, Khnum, Khonsu, and Thoth, and the goddesses Hathor, Isis, Maat, Mut of Asher, Satis and Taweret; in one scene Ramesses is presenting flowers or burning incense. The capitals of the pillars bear {{the face of the}} goddess Hathor; this type of column is known as Hathoric. The bas-reliefs in the pillared hall illustrate the deification of the king, the destruction of his enemies in the north and south (in this scenes the king is accompanied by his wife), and the queen making offerings to the goddess Hathor and Mut. The hypostyle hall is followed by a vestibule, access to which is given by three large doors. On the south and the north walls of this chamber there are two graceful and poetic bas-reliefs of the king and his consort presenting papyrus plants to Hathor, who is depicted as a cow on a boat sailing in a <b>thicket</b> <b>of</b> papyri. On the west wall, RamessesII and Nefertari are depicted making offerings to god Horus and the divinities of the Cataracts — Satis, Anubis and Khnum.|$|E
500|$|In Egyptian accounts, the {{pregnant}} Isis hides from Set, {{to whom the}} unborn child is a threat, in a <b>thicket</b> <b>of</b> papyrus in the Nile Delta. This place is called Akh-bity, meaning [...] "papyrus <b>thicket</b> <b>of</b> the king of Lower Egypt" [...] in Egyptian. Greek writers call this place Khemmis and indicate that it is {{near the city of}} Buto, but in the myth, the physical location is less important than its nature as an iconic place of seclusion and safety. The thicket's special status is indicated by its frequent depiction in Egyptian art; for most events in Egyptian mythology, the backdrop is minimally described or illustrated. In this thicket, Isis gives birth to Horus and raises him, and hence it is also called the [...] "nest of Horus". The image of Isis nursing her child is a very common motif in Egyptian art.|$|E

500|$|His {{opinions}} {{have also}} proved lasting in fields of commercial law. Law students studying torts often encounter Hand's 1947 decision for United States v. Carroll Towing Co., which gave {{a formula for}} determining liability in cases of negligence. Hand's interpretations of complex Internal Revenue Codes, which he called [...] "a <b>thicket</b> <b>of</b> verbiage", {{have been used as}} guides in the gray area between individual and corporate taxes. In an opinion sometimes seen as condoning tax avoidance, Hand stated in 1947 that [...] "there is nothing sinister in so arranging one's affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible". He was referring to reporting of individual income through corporate tax forms for legitimate business reasons. In tax decisions, as in all statutory cases, Hand studied the intent of the original legislation. His opinions became a valuable guide to tax administrators. Hand's landmark decision in United States v. Aluminum Company of America in 1945 influenced the development of antitrust law. His decisions in patent, copyright, and admiralty cases have contributed to the development of law in those fields.|$|E

Heather Cox Richardson praised the book in The Chicago Tribune, calling it [...] "one of those rare books that delivers a great deal more than it promises"; though critical of what she saw as some factual errors and [...] "unsubstantiated claims" [...] by Applegate, such as Lyman Beecher's role in creating mass media, Richardson concluded that these flaws [...] "do not cripple her story".|$|E

[...] The species has not yet been formally assessed for the IUCN Red List, but warrants a [...] "Critically Endangered (CR)" [...] ranking because populations are projected to decline by more than 80% within the next three generations. It is currently listed as [...] "Endangered" [...] under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and [...] "Rare" [...] under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. These acts provide legislative protection against a range of potential threats, including commercial harvesting of flowers and land clearing. Further statutory protection is afforded by the fact that populations occur within the Eastern Stirling Range Montane Heath and Thicket threatened ecological community, which is listed as [...] "Endangered" [...] under the EPBC Act, and the Montane Mallee <b>Thicket</b> <b>of</b> the Stirling Range threatened ecology community, which has been assessed as [...] "Endangered" [...] by the Western Australian government; and by the presence of northern population within the Stirling Range National Park.|$|E
500|$|The ancient epic of the Indian subcontinent, the Mahabharata of Vyasa, {{contains}} two pivotal moments of conscience. The first {{occurs when the}} warrior Arjuna being overcome with compassion against killing his opposing relatives in war, receives counsel (see Bhagavad-Gita) from Krishna about his spiritual duty ("work as though you are performing a sacrifice for the general good"). The second, {{at the end of}} the saga, is when king Yudhishthira having alone survived the moral tests of life, is offered eternal bliss, only to refuse it because a faithful dog is prevented from coming with him by purported divine rules and laws. The French author Montaigne (1533–1592) in one of the most celebrated of his essays ("On experience") expressed the benefits of living with a clear conscience: [...] "Our duty is to compose our character, not to compose books, to win not battles and provinces, but order and tranquillity in our conduct. Our great and glorious masterpiece is to live properly". In his famous Japanese travel journal Oku no Hosomichi (Narrow Road to the Deep North) composed of mixed haiku poetry and prose, Matsuo Basho (1644–94) in attempting to describe the eternal in this perishable world is often moved in conscience; for example by a <b>thicket</b> <b>of</b> summer grass being all that remains of the dreams and ambitions of ancient warriors. Chaucer's [...] "Franklin's Tale" [...] in The Canterbury Tales recounts how a young suitor releases a wife from a rash promise because of the respect in his conscience for the freedom to be truthful, gentle and generous.|$|E

2500|$|New Orleans {{was founded}} in 1718 by the French as Nouvelle-Orléans, under the {{direction}} of Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville. [...] After considering several alternatives, Bienville selected the site for several strategic reasons and practical considerations, including: it was relatively high ground, along a sharp bend of the flood-prone Mississippi River, which thus created a natural levee (previously chosen as the site of an abandoned Quinipissa village); it was adjacent to the trading route and portage between the Mississippi and Lake Pontchartrain via Bayou St. John, offering access to the Gulf of Mexico port of Biloxi without going downriver 100 miles; and it offered control of the entire Mississippi River Valley, at a safe distance from Spanish and English colonial settlements. From its founding, the French intended it to be an important colonial city. [...] The city was named in honor of the then Regent of France, Philip II, Duke of Orléans. [...] The priest-chronicler Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix described it in 1721 as a place of a hundred wretched hovels in a malarious wet <b>thicket</b> <b>of</b> willows and dwarf palmettos, infested by serpents and alligators; he seems to have been the first, however, to predict for it an imperial future. In 1722, Nouvelle-Orléans was made the capital of French Louisiana, replacing Biloxi in that role.|$|E
