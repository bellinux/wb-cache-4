5|$|From various {{symbolic}} motifs the <b>tapestries</b> seem to {{have been}} made to celebrate a marriage, probably that of Anne of Brittany (1477–1514) and Louis XII of France (1462–1515). The royal arms of Louis and Anne would have once decorated the sky in most of the <b>tapestries.</b>|$|E

50|$|The American <b>Tapestry</b> Alliance {{offers a}} variety of programs. The initial exhibitions, Panorama of <b>Tapestry</b> and World <b>Tapestry</b> Today evolved into two biennial, {{international}} juried <b>tapestry</b> exhibits, American <b>Tapestry</b> Biennial and Small <b>Tapestry</b> International. The first American <b>Tapestry</b> Biennial was held in 1996 and a new iteration of the show occurs every second year. Small <b>Tapestry</b> International was initiated in 2009 and is also biennial. ATA also supports a very popular non-juried small format exhibition that attracts both professional and beginning <b>tapestry</b> weavers. ATA's exhibitions have featured well known artists such as Muriel Nezhnie Helfman, Archie Brennan, and Marcel Marois. The exhibits are documented through full color catalogs and are reviewed in a variety of publications. In addition, ATA hosts online exhibitions in the TEx@ATA Gallery. These shows feature contemporary <b>tapestry</b> from around the world and have included online documentation of shows organized by other organizations, such as the Australian <b>Tapestry</b> Workshop.|$|R

5|$|Two of {{the rooms}} have large <b>tapestries</b> on their walls {{depicting}} historical figures and scenes.

These <b>tapestries</b> were initially made for Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester, Zouche's brother-diplomat, but in the end he rejected them for another set; how the first set came to Bramshill is not known. Rubens' sketches for the first and last <b>tapestries</b> in the series are in the Munich gallery, Alte Pinakothek.|$|E

2500|$|Brussels quickly took pre-eminence in <b>tapestry</b> weaving. In 1528 a city decree ordained {{that each}} piece of Brussels <b>tapestry</b> over a certain size bear the woven mark of a red shield flanked by two B's; this aids in {{identifying}} Brussels production. Each <b>tapestry</b> was to include the woven mark of the maker or the merchant who commissioned the <b>tapestry</b> for resale. [...] The public market for <b>tapestry</b> sales was Antwerp.|$|R

5|$|The {{practical}} use of textiles results from their portability; <b>tapestries</b> provided easily assembled interior decorations suited to religious or civic ceremonies. Their value {{is reflected in}} their positioning in contemporary inventories, {{in which they are}} typically found {{at the top of the}} record, then ranked in accordance with their material or colouring. White and gold were considered of the highest quality. Charles V of France had 57 <b>tapestries,</b> of which 16 were white. Jean de Berry owned 19, while Mary of Burgundy, Isabella of Valois, Isabeau of Bavaria and Philip the Good all held substantial collections.|$|E

5|$|For the {{restoration}} of the Gamla stan metro station in 1998 the artist Göran Dahl furnished the walls and floors with motifs from various medieval textiles and manuscripts, including the Överhogdal <b>tapestries</b> and the 14th-century Nobilis humilis (Magnushymnen) from the Orkney Islands. Vädersolstavlan is prominently featured on the eastern wall just south of the platform where the terrazzo wall depicts the emblematic sun dog arcs interwoven with enlarged fragments of textiles.|$|E
50|$|Textile {{works from}} the Middle Ages are kept in the Textile Chamber. The objects are mostly {{textiles}} used in churches or by priests and bishops.

50|$|The {{desire of}} many artists for greater {{interaction}} escalated {{as an international}} <b>tapestry</b> symposium in Melbourne, Australia in 1988 lead to a second organization committed to <b>tapestry,</b> the International <b>Tapestry</b> Network (ITNET). Its goal was to connect American <b>tapestry</b> artists with the burgeoning international community. The magazines were discontinued in 1997 as communicating digitally became a more useful tool for interactions. As the world has moved into the digital age, <b>tapestry</b> artists around the world continue to share and inspire each other's work.|$|R
