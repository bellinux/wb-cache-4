5|$|The Tower domain {{adopts a}} {{secondary}} structure {{consisting of a}} pair of long, antiparallel alpha-helices (the stem) that support a three-helix bundle (3HB) at <b>their</b> <b>end.</b> The 3HB contains a helix-turn-helix motif and is similar to the DNA binding domains of the bacterial site-specific recombinases, and of eukaryotic Myb and homeodomain transcription factors. The Tower domain has {{an important role in the}} tumour suppressor function of BRCA2, and is essential for appropriate binding of BRCA2 to DNA.|$|E

5|$|The central {{pathways}} of metabolism described above, such as glycolysis and the {{citric acid}} cycle, {{are present in}} all three domains of living things and {{were present in the}} last universal common ancestor. This universal ancestral cell was prokaryotic and probably a methanogen that had extensive amino acid, nucleotide, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The retention of these ancient pathways during later evolution {{may be the result of}} these reactions having been an optimal solution to their particular metabolic problems, with pathways such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle producing <b>their</b> <b>end</b> products highly efficiently and in a minimal number of steps. The first pathways of enzyme-based metabolism may have been parts of purine nucleotide metabolism, while previous metabolic pathways were a part of the ancient RNA world.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Cyclone Gene were {{compounded}} by continuous heavy rainfall and subsequent floods {{in most parts}} of Viti Levu. As a result, there was significant disruption to water supplies, with several sources becoming contaminated and destroyed as a result there were several cases of Typhoid reported in Fiji with at least 1 person dying from typhoid. There was also seven other deaths from cyclone Gene, five of these were directly related whilst two people were also killed as an indirect result of Cyclone Gene from house fires while using candles to light their homes when the power went out. Within <b>their</b> <b>end</b> of season report RSMC Nadi reported that the total cost of Cyclone Gene was F$51 million(2008), ($35 million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} theology {{teaching of}} positive confession stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The Bible {{is seen as}} a faith contract between God and believers; God is understood to be faithful and just, so believers must fulfill <b>their</b> <b>end</b> of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in positive confession, the doctrine that believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology teaches that the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so positive confession means that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. Positive confession is practiced to bring about what is already believed in; faith itself is a confession, and speaking it brings it into reality.|$|E

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} the House of Plantagenet's two cadet {{branches}} of York and Lancaster {{brought about the}} Wars of the Roses, a decades-long fight for the English succession, culminating in the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, when {{the reign of the}} Plantagenets and the English Middle Ages both met <b>their</b> <b>end</b> with the death of King Richard III. Henry VII, of Lancastrian descent, became king of England; two years later, he married Elizabeth of York, thus ending the Wars of the Roses, and giving rise to the Tudor dynasty. The Tudors worked to centralise English royal power, which allowed them to avoid {{some of the problems that}} had plagued the last Plantagenet rulers. The resulting stability allowed for the English Renaissance, and the advent of early modern Britain.|$|E
5|$|After the CIA clears them, {{they return}} to England to attend the wedding of Baxter's eldest daughter. Rick reveals he sold Alvo's villa and signed the others' name without permission. Although the others {{initially}} resent Rick for this, the four become wealthy as a result. Two months later {{they return to}} Cape Town to visit Quinn's villa, where Baxter and Carmen reunite. Meanwhile, a wheelchair-bound Dominic tracks the four down and arrives with his gang, with all members wearing Blair masks. After initially evading the gang, Baxter accidentally kills Carmen, mistaking her for an assassin. The four drive to one of Rick's contacts at a beach, only to be surrounded and executed by the gang upon arrival. In a state of Limbo, their souls leave the beach. Baxter spots one of the assassins, who removes the Blair mask to reveal a sinister version of himself. Their car drives past an unfinished interchange, and it plunges, where the four would meet <b>their</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam {{gathered}} {{delegates from}} 14 different countries, among which important {{figures of the}} anarchist movement, including Errico Malatesta, Pierre Monatte, Luigi Fabbri, Benoît Broutchoux, Emma Goldman, Rudolf Rocker, and Christiaan Cornelissen. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, popular education issues, the general strike or antimilitarism. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade unionism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient. He thought that the trade-union movement was reformist and even conservative, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as <b>their</b> <b>end</b> and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.|$|E

5|$|Mining was {{challenging}} as the ore {{was distributed}} in an uneven manner and digging was made slow by permafrost. As a result, some miners chose {{to buy and}} sell claims, building up huge investments and letting others do the work. To accommodate the prospectors, boom towns sprang up along the routes and at <b>their</b> <b>end</b> Dawson City was founded at the confluence of the Klondike and the Yukon River. From a population of 500 in 1896, the town grew to house around 30,000 people by summer 1898. Built of wood, isolated and unsanitary, Dawson suffered from fires, high prices, and epidemics. Despite this, the wealthiest prospectors spent extravagantly gambling and drinking in the saloons. The Native Hän people, on the other hand, suffered from the rush, being moved into a reserve {{to make way for the}} stampeders, and many died.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{received}} the game's opening kickoff in <b>their</b> <b>end</b> zone for a touchback, and the Tech offense began at its 20-yard line. On the game's first play, Tech committed a five-yard false start penalty. Running back Shyrone Stith was {{stopped for a}} loss on the first non-penalty play of the game, but Tech made up both that loss and the penalty when quarterback Michael Vick scrambled for 25yards and a first down. Vick then ran for another nine yards, pushing {{the line of scrimmage}} near midfield. Tech executed an option run to Stith, who ran inside the Florida State 30-yard line. Tech picked up a few yards with a run up the middle, then Vick completed a pass to Davis, giving the Hokies a first down at the Florida State 13-yard line. Stith picked up seven yards on a rush to the six-yard line, but the Seminole defense stiffened, and Tech was unable to pick up the remaining three yards needed for a first down. Facing a fourth down and needing less than a yard to pick up another first down inside the Florida State three-yard line, Tech head coach Frank Beamer kept his offense on the field to attempt to gain the first down rather than kick a field goal. On the attempt, however, Vick fumbled the ball forward into the end zone, where Florida State recovered it for a touchback. Virginia Tech was thus denied the first score of the game, and Florida State's offense entered the game for the first time.|$|E
