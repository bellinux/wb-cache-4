5|$|Carl (Martin Sheen's character) {{represents}} {{the working class}} in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> {{as a threat to}} his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings form the basis of the film's subtext. This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in Platoon. In Wall Street the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the creative destruction brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Asumi's {{elementary}} and middle school classmate Shinnosuke Fuchuya also enters the academy much to her surprise. He defended Asumi from ridicule by other classmates throughout their childhood despite occasionally teasing her as well, and it has been suggested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> her as a romantic interest. The two eventually befriend three other students in the astronaut training program. Shu Suzuki, who is named student representative for the astronaut program, has an easygoing personality. He wears a distinctive face by shaving his eyebrows as a symbol of defiance against his father. Kei Oumi befriends Asumi during the academy's entrance examination and is portrayed with an outgoing personality and a deep sense of loyalty toward her friends. Marika Ukita initially responds coldly toward gestures of friendship, but she moves into Asumi's dormitory following an argument with her father. The five students later make a promise to complete the astronaut program together as their friendship grows stronger. After three years in the astronaut program, Asumi is chosen out of eleven remaining students to take part in Japan's second human spaceflight mission, making her, at the age of eighteen, the youngest person to go into space.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E

25|$|After being rescued and {{returning}} to Lestat's home with him, Nicki pleads to become a vampire. Lestat refuses, but is finally convinced to turn Nicki into a vampire. As Lestat feeds from Nicolas, he is plunged into the darkness in which Nicolas resides. He describes the scene as a seamless black sea, where all colours have faded, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> only a bird soaring over the void expanse. He describes a feeling of having lost all that was once cherished. He describes it also as worse than his moment of darkness at the Inn, and tries to recoil from it. He finally turns Nicki into a vampire, which strains their friendship.|$|E
25|$|This poem, {{traditionally}} placed at Amores 3.5, is considered spurious. The poet describes {{a dream to}} an interpreter, saying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> while escaping from the heat of noon a white heifer near a bull; when the heifer is pecked by a crow, it leaves the bull for a meadow with other bulls. The interpreter interprets the dream as a love allegory; the bull represents the poet, the heifer a girl, and the crow an old woman. The old woman spurs the girl to leave her lover and find someone else. The poem {{is known to have}} circulated independently and its lack of engagement with Tibullan or Propertian elegy argue in favor of its spuriousness; however, the poem does seem to be datable to the early empire.|$|E

25|$|Yoong {{was born}} on 20 July 1976 at the Sambhi Clinic in Kuala Lumpur. His mother, Johanna Bean, is a British {{expatriate}} and his father Hanifah Yoong Yin Fah is a Malaysian of Chinese descent through Alex's grandfather Yoong Wan Hoi who emigrated in 1933. His grandfather worked as a contractor and steel trader but was forced to retire during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In an interview in 1999, Yoong states <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> himself first as a Malaysian, then part Chinese and part English.

25|$|Freyr himself {{interrupts}} at this point, {{and says}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> a wolf lying before a river mouth, and that, unless Loki is immediately silent, like the wolf, Loki shall also be bound until Ragnarök. Loki retorts that Freyr purchased his consort Gerðr with gold, having given away his sword, {{which he will}} lack at Ragnarök. Byggvir (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says {{that if he had}} as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, and says that Byggvir is always found at Freyr's ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he's proud to be here by all the gods and men, and that he's said to be speedy. Loki tells him to be silent, that Byggvir does not know how to apportion food among men, and that he hides among the straw and dais when men go to battle.|$|E
25|$|Solas {{confesses to}} being Fen'Harel, and {{creating}} the Veil {{in order to}} seal away the Evanuris after they assassinated Mythal, {{the only one who}} kept their ambition in check, before their lust for power destroyed the world. He also reveals his intentions to restore the world of the ancient elves, even if he must destroy the world of the present day. If asked about his role in the events of the core game, Solas explains that he had arranged for Corypheus to obtain the magical orb he used, intending for the magister to unlock it and kill himself in the subsequent explosion, after which Solas would retrieve the orb and use the Anchor to tear down the Veil, restoring the world of the ancient elves. After Corypheus survived the blast, an event Solas had not foreseen, Solas joined and supported the Inquisition, seeing them as the world's best hope of defeating Corypheus. If questioned about why he arranged for the Dragon's Breath plot to be discovered, depending on whether or not he is friends with the Inquisitor, he will either admit <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> value in the present world, or that he simply wanted to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. At the end of their conversation, Solas magically amputates the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaves, with the Inquisitor resolving to stop him by any means necessary. Alternatively, an Inquisitor who befriended Solas can vow to convince him to abandon his plan, with Solas replying that he would be glad to be proven wrong again.|$|E
