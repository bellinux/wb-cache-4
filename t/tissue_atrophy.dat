50|$|Cerebral atrophy is {{a common}} feature {{of many of the}} {{diseases}} that affect the brain. Atrophy of any tissue means a decrement {{in the size of the}} cell, which can be due to progressive loss of cytoplasmic proteins.

Atrophy can be generalized, which means that all of the brain has shrunk; or it can be focal, affecting only a limited area of the brain and resulting in a decrease of the functions that area of the brain controls. If the cerebral hemispheres (the two lobes of the brain that form the cerebrum) are affected, conscious thought and voluntary processes may be impaired.|$|E

50|$|Tissue {{expansion}} {{has been}} used on the scalp for treating scalp scarring, in lieu of hair transplation when there is insufficient donor hair to transplant on the scar or the scar tissue is not vascularized to support hair growth. For instance, in a patient who had melanomas removed from the scalp resulting in alopecia defects (hair loss), tissue expansion {{can be used to}} allow for the removal of scars and complete hair coverage. The two main indications for choosing tissue expansion over hair grafting are {{the size and shape of}} the defect relative to potential supply of donor hair, and the quality and thickness of the scar tissue. Areas of significant scarring and/or <b>tissue</b> <b>atrophy,</b> which is likely to make hair grafting unsuccessful, are best excised and replaced by normal expanded scalp skin. Theoretically, there is no limit to the amount of tissue that can be created with tissue expansion, provided the process is conducted gradually.|$|E

40|$|AbstractProgressive hemifacial atrophy (PHA) is a self-limited atrophy of {{subcutaneous}} tissues (and {{less frequently}} of hard tissues) {{on one side}} of the face. It is a sporadic, slowly progressing disease whose pathogenesis is still unknown. As a rule the asymmetry caused by PHA (usually of soft tissue) is treated by volume augmentation that involves free tissue grafting or a pedicled flap transfer. We describe a rare case of hard tissue PHA. The atrophic changes occurred in the left molar tooth, maxilla and mandible and were associated with moderate soft <b>tissue</b> <b>atrophy.</b> The left side of the patient's mouth was higher on the right side, and the occlusal plane was severely inclined in spite of normal occlusion. After no alteration and no progression of the atrophy were established, the patient was treated with orthodontic surgery. To correct the inclined occlusal plane and asymmetry profile, we performed a Le Fort I and intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy. In the 3 -year follow-up, there were good occlusal balance and improved symmetrical profile without relapse or recurrence of the atrophy. Thus, orthodontic surgery was effective as a first procedure to treat hard <b>tissue</b> <b>atrophy</b> that appeared with moderate soft <b>tissue</b> <b>atrophy...</b>|$|E

Methods: A total of 120 participants with hypertrophic scars {{were enrolled in the}} current study. Participants were divided into two groups based on sex, and then randomly and evenly divided into four groups (Groups A, B, C, and D). Participants in Group A received microplasma radiofrequency technology combined with triamcinolone. Participants in Group B received microplasma radiofrequency technology combined with normal saline. Participants in Groups C and D received triamcinolone (40 and 10 mg/mL) injected directly into scar. Experienced physicians evaluated the condition of scars according to the Vancouver Scar Scale 1 month before and after the therapy. Results: There was no difference in age, sex, area, height and location of scars, and Vancouver Scar Scale scores before the therapy between any groups (P> 0. 05 for all). Vancouver Scar Scale scores after the therapy were significantly lower than those before the therapy in all groups (P 0. 05 for all).

Effects of ovarian hormones on the uterine luminal epithelium were examined under the light microscope.
