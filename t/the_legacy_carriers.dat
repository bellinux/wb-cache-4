50|$|Airlines quickly {{moved to}} a {{hub-and-spoke}} system, whereby an airline selected an airport, the hub, as the destination point for flights {{from a number of}} origination cities, the spokes. Because the size of the planes used varied according to the travel on that spoke, and since hubs allowed passenger travel to be consolidated in “transfer stations”, capacity utilization increased. The hub-and-spoke model survives among <b>the</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>carriers,</b> but the low-cost carriers (LCCs), now 30 percent of the market, typically fly point to point. The network hubs model offers consumers more convenience for routes, but point-to-point routes have proven less costly for airlines to implement. Over time, <b>the</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>carriers</b> and the LCCs will likely use some combination of point to point and network hubs to capture both economies of scale and pricing advantages.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{we develop}} a {{framework}} for analyzing airlines' operational performances under different strategic decisions. A detailed study is conducted to compare differences between a major U. S. <b>legacy</b> <b>carrier</b> and a major U. S. low-cost carrier {{in terms of their}} scheduling practices, flight-based delays and on-time performances, network operations and mix of passengers, as well as passenger delays and disruptions. One major contribution of this thesis is that the framework we develop to evaluate airlines' performances is not restricted by the availability of proprietary airline data and can be adopted to estimate itinerary-based passenger demand for any U. S. airline included in the Bureau of Transportation Statistics database. Moreover, in this thesis, we compute delay for local and connecting passengers and provide a powerful tool for scenario analysis. Further, we: (1) identify root causes of delays as well as the impact throughout the network; (2) gain insights about how passenger delay can be reduced with different scheduling practices; and (3) guide the design of on-time performance metrics. Differences in scheduling practices, network operations, passenger mix, aircraft delays, and passenger delays between different airlines arise from carrier-specific characteristics. These characteristics should be considered when designing on-time performance metrics. (cont.) Characteristics specific to <b>the</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>carrier</b> are: (1) its hubs experience heavy traffic volume and are often subject to ground delay programs (GDPs) caused by poor weather conditions; and (2) it operates banked hubs where a set of arriving flight legs are scheduled closely with a set of departing flight legs to allow passenger connections between arriving and departing flight legs. Characteristics specific to the low-cost carrier are: (1) it tends to fly into locations that are less impacted by weather conditions and less frequently subjected to GDPs; (2) passenger traffic is distributed more evenly in the system, unlike the case of <b>the</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>carrier</b> in which a much larger portion of passengers connect through the major hubs; and (3) it has depeaked schedules at the major airports which allow the carrier to achieve higher efficiency in turning aircraft. Another important distinction between the two airlines that needs to be considered when designing on-time performance metrics is: the ratio of passenger delay (especially disrupted passenger delay) to operated flight delay for the low-cost carrier was higher than the corresponding value for <b>the</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>carrier.</b> This difference indicates that flight-specific on-time performance metrics that ignore airline heterogeneity can be an inaccurate measure of passenger experiences. In this thesis, scenario representations pertaining to various levels of airport traffic under different weather conditions are analyzed within our framework. We measure passenger delays (that is, the positive difference between the actual arrival time of the passenger at his/her destination and the scheduled arrival time) and passenger disruptions, with a passenger disruption defined as a passenger who is re-booked on an itinerary other than that planned due to a missed connection or flight cancellation. (cont.) Our results show that for <b>the</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>carrier,</b> an increase in flight operations of one percent on the "high-delay" day translates to an increase in the percentage of disrupted passengers (average disrupted passenger delay) of 22. 2 % (3. 1 %); for the low-cost carrier, an increase in flight operations of one percent only increases the percentage of disrupted passengers (average disrupted passenger delay) by 12. 3 % (2. 7 %). The above statistics suggest that under poor weather conditions, increasing flight operations at busy airports, compared to non-congested airports, can cause a much greater increase in passenger delay and disruptions when airport capacity is reduced by adverse weather condition. by Ying Zhu.

40|$|Legacy {{carriers}} developed hub {{networks to}} achieve {{a high concentration of}} operations, increase frequency, and serve multiple Origin-Destination markets with maximum efficiency. By contrast, the rapid emergence of low-cost carriers (LCCs) is mainly based on a low-fare entry strategy in point-to-point markets competing with the traditional connecting paths offered by <b>the</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>carriers</b> via their hubs. This thesis examines the traffic and revenue impacts of an LCC developing a point-to-point network in a legacy hub network environment. To this purpose, we use the Passenger Origin-Destination Simulator (PODS) to perform all quantitative evaluations. Modeling the choice of travelers with regard to flight schedules and fares, as well as the airlines' revenue management systems, PODS allows one to investigate the changes in aggregate and disaggregate airline statistics following the introduction of low-fare service on point-to-point routes. The first goal of the thesis is to review and update models of passenger choice between connecting legacy and non-stop low-cost paths. The review of the literature on air traveler choice provides parameters and benchmarks critical to the calibration of PODS. (cont.) We then simulate a LCC entry case, and calibrate the Passenger Decision Model (PDM) embedded in PODS through sensitivity analysis. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, we analyze the introduction of LCC operations in two legacy hub networks, a theoretical symmetric and a more realistic asymmetric network. Two different LCC strategies were considered. In the first case, LCC routes are added to the legacy network with one daily frequency, while the second strategy is characterized by two daily flights in each market entered by the low-fare airline. For both networks and strategies, the analysis reveals that legacy revenues are greatly reduced whereas the decrease in legacy traffic is limited even with extended and aggressive low-cost competition, allowing <b>the</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>carriers</b> to maintain their network load factors at high levels. The lower fares implemented by the LCC and matched by the legacy airlines lead to the reduced legacy revenues. However, legacy carriers can rely on demand stimulation, as well as great demand in local hub markets and connecting markets not served by the LCC, to replace traffic captured by the new entrant. by Gregory Zerbib.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{investigates the}} nature of conduct {{that existed in the}} U. S. airline hub-to-hub markets prior to the recent merger wave of <b>the</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>carriers.</b> We explore the {{strategic}} importance of network carrier hubs in form of “spheres of influence” on airline market conduct. We also simultaneously recognize the overgrowing role played by Low Cost Carriers (LCC) over the years by estimating two conduct parameters - one in markets where LCCs directly compete head-to-head with legacy carriers and the other for markets which LCCs do not serve but has presence in the hub airports or adjacent airports comprising the market endpoints. Thus our supply side framework also sheds some light on the issue of perfect contestability in airline industry. Design/methodology/approach: We estimate a structural oligopoly model for differentiated products with competitive interactions using DB 1 B data for first quarter of 2004. Findings: Our results imply that {{the nature of}} competition is more aggressive relative to Bertrand behavior in hub-to-hub markets and that these markets are less than perfectly contestable. Originality/value: This paper adds to the empirical literature of airline competition by enabling estimation of the actual conduct parameter assuming firm price setting behavior in presence of product differentiation. Contrary to existing literature on airline competition, a structural model enables us to systematically separate out effects of demand, cost and strategic factors on observed airline prices...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{methodology}} to empirically study {{the behavior of}} firms deciding whether {{to enter into a}} market and the prices they charge if they enter. In our multi-agent selection model firms simultaneously play an entry game, and, conditional on entry, set profit maximizing prices. The main complications we analyze are ones that result from the presence of multiplicity in the entry stage and the endogeneity of prices in the demand equations. We use cross-sectional data from the US airline industry and estimate the same model, while allowing for the unobservables to be correlated. We find: i) the markup is larger when we use the new methodology than what we find when run standard GMM, implying that models that do not account for endogenous market structure give bias estimates of price elasticity and therefore market power; ii) LCCs and Southwest have considerably lower marginal costs; iii) Southwest has lower, and LCCs have higher, fixed costs than <b>the</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>carriers.</b> We also run two counterfactual exercises, one where the legacy firms collude, and another where two legacy carriers merge.

40|$|This thesis aims at {{investigating}} the behaviour of airlines in recently liberalised markets, by {{making use of}} the Brazilian air transportation as a case study. In order to accomplish this objective, the following three essays were developed: a study of low cost carrier entry behaviour, {{an analysis of the}} pricing behaviour of the major incumbents in the industry, and, finally, an assessment of airline conduct in the most important market in the country. All essays contain empirical investigation performed by making use of data supplied by Brazil’s Department of Civil Aviation, DAC. In the first essay, the entry of Gol Airlines on several Brazilian domestic routes, in 2001 and 2002, is analysed in order to draw inference on the competition between a discounter in rapid expansion and the full-service carriers. A route-choice model is estimated by making use of a flexible post-entry equilibrium profits equation and accounting for endogeneity of the main variables. The second essay aims at empirically {{investigating the}} pricing behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>carriers</b> in Brazil, with special focus on reactions to the entry of Gol, in 2001. A study of localised competitive advantage regarding the determinants of pricing power is performed along with the analysis of the pattern of price reactions by the incumbents. A single econometric framework is designed and estimated with panel data controlling for city-specific effects. And finally, the third essay aims at assessing the impacts of economic liberalisation on the route Rio de Janeiro - São Paulo. By making use of both a two-stages budgeting representation of the demand system, and a competition model with product heterogeneity among rivals, and based on the framework of the New Empirical Industrial Organisation, it was possible to examine the existence of a structural change on airlines’ conduct parameters due to the regulatory reform.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, many {{low-cost}} airlines have been created around the world. Legacy carriers used to apply revenue management (RM) to fully-restricted fare structures with segmented demand. These low-fare competitors with simplified or unrestricted fare structures often manage to capture {{an important part of}} the demand in the markets they enter, forcing legacy carriers to change their fare structures. However, because of this change in fare structures, most RM forecasters and optimizers that were previously used by <b>the</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>carriers</b> are no longer effective. The goal of this thesis is to describe and test two RM methods based on dynamic programming in fare structures with few or no restrictions. The first one, the "Lautenbacher" approach (DP-LB), was developed for fully-restricted environments but, when associated with an appropriate forecaster, may be used in less-restricted fare structures. The second one, the "Gallego-Van Ryzin" approach (DP-GVR), was developed for unrestricted fare structures. In this thesis we describe these two methods, and analyze the performance of both in comparison with the performance of traditional RM methods used by legacy carriers, based on results obtained with the Passenger Origin-Destination Simulation (PODS). In our simulation DP-LB leads to results very close to those obtained with traditional RM methods. In unrestricted fare structures DP-GVR appeared to be theoretically appealing. The simulation results obtained with DP-GVR against a competitor using no RM or against a competitor using the same RM method were better than those obtained with other RM methods. But against advanced competitors, DP-GVR got worse results than other RM methods. (cont.) We showed that this variability in the performance of DP-GVR was related to its sensitivity to forecasts of probabilities of sell-up, forecasts that are difficult to estimate because they depend on the RM methods and actions of the competition. Further study with improved estimation of probabilities of sell-up will be required to determine whether this method can lead to stable improvement over traditional RM methods in unrestricted fare structures. by Thierry Vanhaverbeke.

40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has been a}} period of {{fundamental}} transformations for the US airline industry and has caused many carriers to make significant changes in their operational strategies. The traditional US network or "Legacy" carriers have {{had to deal with}} many new challenges including the devastating effects of 9 / 11, increased competition from low-cost airlines and increased volatility in fuel prices, to name a few. These setbacks have pushed many carriers into a financial crisis. In fact, four out of the six major airlines in the United States filed for bankruptcy protection between 2001 and 2005. In the midst of this crisis, these traditional carriers have had to concentrate on reducing their unit costs and improving their productivity levels in order to survive. The goal of the thesis is to examine to what extent these changes have led to a convergence in terms of unit costs and productivity levels between <b>the</b> <b>Legacy</b> <b>carriers</b> and their low-cost counterparts. Specifically we analyze and break down unit costs and productivity measures into their underlying components in order to identify what is driving change in the industry. We compare the different results at various levels of detail, including aggregate industry group trends, individual airline results and fleet-level based results comparing wide-body to narrow-body aircraft. We find that there are both qualitative and quantitative signs of convergence in several different categories in which LCCs have traditionally held a competitive advantage. These include unit costs excluding fuel and transport-related expenses, labor unit costs and employee wage productivity. On the Legacy side, the key forces driving improved efficiency have been dramatic labors cuts and higher stage lengths. (cont.) The former has been achieved by utilizing the bankruptcy while the latter results from the shifting of capacity towards international markets. On the LCC side we find that a significant increase in labor wages resulting from increased staff seniority has been the main source of losses in certain productivity results. Despite these signs of convergence, our fleet-level based analysis also showed that LCCs still retain a significant competitive advantage when isolating narrow-body fleets which are usually flown in the domestic US markets. by Gerassimos Tsoukalas.

The research questions were answered {{through the use of}} a mixed method approach. The research was carried out in two phases. The first phase involved environmental scanning through the process of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis, where the strengths and weaknesses of the internal environment of Saudi Arabian Airlines were appraised. It also examined the possible opportunities and threats of the external environment (i. e. the Middle East region), where Saudi Arabian Airlines is situated. The second phase involved a survey where the feasibility of a new route (i. e. Jeddah–Bali–Auckland) was examined and evaluated. The results suggested that the exponential growth of the aviation industry in the Middle East can be capitalized by Saudi Arabian Airlines by using its recognized strengths and addressing the concerns that have emerged in this study. A possible strategy by which these concerns can be addressed is through establishing a new route that Saudi Arabian Airlines can take advantage of in the future to fulfil its ambitions of becoming one of the top airlines in the aviation industry. One specific route that the thesis examines is the Jeddah–Bali–Auckland route, where there is a substantial market which will yield an increased profit margin and therefore impact the growth of Saudi Arabian Airlines...|$|R
