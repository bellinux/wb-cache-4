40|$|Time {{needed to}} report {{surveillance}} data {{within the public}} health service delays public health actions. The amendment to the infection protection act (IfSG) from 29 March 2013 requires local and state public health agencies to report surveillance data within one working day instead of one week. We analysed factors associated with reporting time and evaluated the IfSG amendment. Local reporting time is <b>the</b> time between <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> export to <b>the</b> state public health agency and state reporting time is time between <b>date</b> <b>of</b> arrival at <b>the</b> state public health agency and <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> export. We selected cases reported between 28 March 2012 and 28 March 2014. We calculated the median local and state reporting time, stratified by potentially influential factors, computed a negative binominal regression model and assessed quality and workload parameters. Before the IfSG amendment the median local reporting time was 4 days and 1 day afterwards. The state reporting time was 0 days before and after. Influential factors are the individual local public health agency, the notified disease, the notification software and the day of the week. Data quality and workload parameters did not change. The IfSG amendment has decreased local reporting time, no relevant loss of data quality or identifiable workload-increase could be detected. State reporting time is negligible. We recommend efforts to harmonise practices of local public health agencies including the exclusive use of software with fully compatible interfaces...|$|R

5000|$|So-called [...] "centralised" [...] (European Medicines Agency / European Commission) MAs were {{introduced}} by Regulation 2309/93 and became available in January 1995 (i.e. some 2 {{years after the}} introduction of the original SPC legislation for medicinal products). The introduction of these authorisations added a new layer of complexity to the issue of determination of the date of a MA. This is because there are two dates associated with [...] "centralised" [...] authorisations, namely: (1) the date of the European Commission's decision to issue an authorisation; and (2) <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> of that decision to the MA applicant. Date (2) is usually a few days (e.g. 2 to 4 days) later than date (1). Although the standard practice of many national patent offices seems to be to calculate SPC term based upon date (1), an October 2011 article in Scrip Regulatory Affairs by Mike Snodin argues that this standard practice is incorrect and that date (2) should be used instead (with the result that some products may be entitled to a slightly longer SPC term than previously thought). Paramount amongst the reasons for preferring date (2) to date (1) is that a [...] "centralised" [...] authorisation does not become effective until it is notified to the MA applicant.|$|E
50|$|Between 5 February and 5 March 1979, {{plans for}} the (northern) section 3 were {{developed}} in the Mannheim town hall. A citizens' initiative against the project had formed. It demanded, among other things, the relocation of the existing and the new railway facilities, the adjacent federal highway and the tram tunnel; the associated costs were calculated by Deutsche Bundesbahn as around DM one billion. The lowering of the railway tracks and a later lowering of the federal highway, which was also demanded, would have improved the poor conditions in {{the centre of the}} Waldhof district. DB found that an underground route would be technically feasible but financially unacceptable. The public hearing on this section, which was initially scheduled for 15 January 1980, was postponed to 31 January 1980 at the insistence of the concerned citizens, who criticised <b>the</b> <b>date</b> and type <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> It finally took place at the end of March 1980. DB again refused the demands of most objectors for an underground route. A common planning approach by the city, state, federal government and Deutsche Bundesbahn eventually emerged in response {{to the demands of the}} citizens' initiative. Despite maintaining the above ground route, improvements could be achieved. Among other things, street signage would be changed, pedestrian links would be separated from the railway by noise barriers and the construction of freight facilities would be delayed. DB presented this solution in detail to the public and it was explained and discussed. This compromise was not opposed.|$|R
40|$|Background Information on {{recurrent}} tuberculosis {{can provide}} {{an indication of the}} effectiveness of tuberculosis services and identify patients who are most vulnerable. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the incidence of, and investigate risk factors for, recurrent episodes of tuberculosis in England and Wales. Methods Episodes of recurrent tuberculosis were identified among prospectively collected records of tuberculosis cases reported to the Health Protection Agency between 1998 and 2005. An episode of recurrent tuberculosis was defined as a re-notified case in the same patient after at least 12 months from <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>notification.</b> To estimate incidence, follow-up time was calculated for all cases until re-notification or censure. Multivariable Cox proportionate hazard models were used to determine hazard ratios (HR) for recurrence of tuberculosis and investigate the risk associated with clinical, demographic and microbiological factors. Results Five hundred and eighty-eight recurrent tuberculosis events were identified among 53 ? 214 cases reported between 1998 and 2005, a rate of 4. 1 (95 % CI 3. 8 to 4. 5) episodes per 1000 person years of follow-up. Factors independently associated with a greater risk of recurrent tuberculosis were HIV co-infection (HR 1. 64, 95 % CI 1. 13 to 2. 38) and belonging to a South Asian ethnic group (HR 1. 54, 95 % CI 1. 23 to 1. 93). Conclusion Tuberculosis recurrence is uncommon in England and Wales despite the absence of a universal directly observed treatment policy. The identification of HIV co-infection as a risk factor for recurrent tuberculosis is consistent with findings elsewhere. The higher risk among South Asians, however, requires further investigation...|$|R

50|$|The PPV&FR Act, 2001 {{was enacted}} to grant {{intellectual}} property rights to plant breeders, researchers and farmers who have developed any new or extant plant varieties. The Intellectual Property Right granted under PPV&FR Act, 2001 is a dual right - one is for the variety {{and the other is}} for the denomination assigned to it by the breeder. The rights granted under this Act are heritable and assignable and only registration of a plant variety confers the right. Essentially Derived Varieties (EDV) can also be registered under this Act and it may be new or extant. Farmers are entitled to save, use, sow, re-sow, exchange or sell their farm produce including seed of a registered variety in an unbranded manner. Farmers' varieties are eligible for registration and farmers are totally exempted from payment of any fee in any proceedings under this Act. The period of protection for field crops is 15 years and for trees and vines is 18 years and for notified varieties it is 15 years from <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> under section 5 of Seeds Act, 1966. Annual fee has to be paid every year for maintaining the registration and renewal fee has to be paid for the extended period of registration. Farmers can claim for compensation if the registered variety fails to provide expected performance under given conditions. The rights granted under this Act are exclusive right to produce, sell, market, distribute, import and export the variety. Civil and criminal remedies are provided for enforcement of breeders' rights and provisions relating to benefit sharing and compulsory licence in case registered variety is not made available to the public at reasonable price are provided. Compensation is also provided for village or rural communities if any registered variety has been developed using any variety in whose evolution such village or local community has contributed significantly. The procedural details and modes of implementing this Act are provided in PPV&FR Rules, 2003. In the present article, we are discussing some of the important legal provisions of this Act along with some of the case studies.|$|E
40|$|Acquisition Act, 1894 clearly {{provides}} {{that the amount}} of compensation awarded for the land acquired is required to be determined on the basis of market value of the land at the time of publication of the Notification under Section 4 of the Act. Therefore, it is the duty of both, the Land Acquisition Officer as also of the court, to determine the actual compensation payable for the land acquired by referring to evidence regarding fair and just compensation near about the proximate date or on the date itself of the publication of the notification under section 4 of the Act. At times, in order to prove the actual, fair and just compensation for the land acquired, sale deeds of the adjacent land or nearabout adjacent land are produced to indicate the trend {{of the value of the}} land within the near vicinity of the acquired land. Such sale deeds are taken notice of generally when they are prior in point of time to <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>Notification,</b> and any sale deed which is dated post Notification is generally ignored, unless evidence is led to show that there was no increase in price despite such acquisition. As a result of such acquisition, the market value of the adjacent land would generally, and in most cases, go up and, therefore, such post notification transaction may not be a sound criterion to determine and assess the value of the acquired land. [Paras 12 and 14] [8 -F-H; 10 -C] 1. 2 In the instant case, the appellant has not adduced any evidence to show that the market value of adjacent land has not increased in the interregnum. Ex.

40|$|Aim: This {{study was}} done to {{investigate}} unintentional solvent exposure in Srinakharinwirot university hospital staffs with unknown etiology. Material and Methods: A multidisciplinary investigation was conducted. Total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) in working environments were measured. Biomarkers of exposure and self-administered questionnaires about clinical symptoms were collected, {{during and after the}} incidence, from the affected workers. Results: The reason behind this event was found to be renovation of the 15 th floor. TVOCs contaminated the air hanging unit of the lower 5 th floor via space of the pipeline system of the building. The average TVOC value in the complaint area, on <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification,</b> was 9. 5 ppm. The symptoms and level of hippuric acid, collected during the incidence, were significantly higher than those collected after the problems were solved.

40|$|Abstract: Bacteremia is {{associated}} with high morbidity and mortality. Improving prevention and treatment requires better knowledge {{of the disease and}} its prognosis. However, in order to study the entire spectrum of bacteremia patients, we need valid sources of information, prospective data collection, and complete follow-up. In North Denmark Region, all patients diagnosed with bacteremia have been registered in a population-based database since 1981. The information has been recorded prospectively since 1992 and the main variables are: the patient’s unique civil registration number, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> sampling <b>the</b> first positive blood culture, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> admission, clinical department, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> growth, place of acquisition, focus of infection, microbiological species, antibiogram, and empirical antimicrobial treatment. During the time from 1981 to 2008, information on 22, 556 cases of bacteremia has been recorded. The civil registration number makes it possible to link the database to other medical databases and thereby build large cohorts with detailed longitudinal data that include hospital histories since 1977, comorbidity data, and complete follow-up of survival. The database is suited for epidemiological research and, presently, approximately 60 studies have been published. Other Danish departments of clinical microbiology have recently started to record the same information and a population base of 2. 3 million will be available for future studies...|$|R
