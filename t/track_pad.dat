50|$|Metabolomic Pathway Analysis, {{shortened}} to MetPA, is a freely available, user-friendly {{web server}} {{to assist with}} the identification analysis and visualization of metabolic pathways using metabolomic data. MetPA makes use of advances originally developed for pathway analysis in microarray experiments and applies those principles and concepts to the analysis of metabolic pathways. For input, MetPA expects either a list of compound names (identified as statistically significant or significant perturbed) or a metabolite concentration table with phenotypic labels (i.e. sick vs. healthy). The list of compounds can include common names, HMDB IDs or KEGG IDs with one compound per row. Compound concentration tables must have samples in rows and compounds in columns. MetPAâ€™s output is a series of tables indicating which pathways are significantly enriched (along with accompanying statistics) as well as a variety of graphs or pathway maps illustrating where and how certain pathways were enriched. MetPAâ€™s graphical output uses a colorful Google-Maps visualization system that allows simple, intuitive data exploration that lets users employ a computer mouse or <b>track</b> <b>pad</b> to select, drag and place images and to seamlessly zoom in and out. Users can explore MetPAâ€™s output using three different views or levels: 1) a metabolome view; 2) a pathway view; 3) a compound view.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Generally, field {{performance}} of elastomeric <b>track</b> <b>pad</b> components has been poor, {{especially for the}} medium to heavy tonnage tracked vehicles, which are operated on the hilly cross-country course. The service life of these <b>track</b> <b>pad,</b> is affected {{not only by the}} terrain and environmental conditions but also by the speed, cornering, braking, weight of the vehicle, and the track tread design. In this research, modulus, tearing energy, and the rate of crack propagation of vulcanizates are evaluated by changing base materials to improve the service time of <b>track</b> <b>pad.</b> By increasing the contents of carbon black, modulus, tearing energy, and fatigue crack growth resistance of vulca-nizates improved. Compared with the NR vulcanizate, the HNBR vulcanizate had a higher value of tearing energy. The rate of crack propagation of vulcanizates using smaller size carbon black was slower than that using larger size carbon black. When the HNBR was blended with the ZSC, the tearing energy of the vulcanizates was a little reduced because of the high modulus but the crack propagation rate was reduced significantly. In the relation between the crack propagation rate and the strain energy release rate, though up to 100 % strain were applied to specimens, the slope on the log scale (Î²) varied between 1. 72 and 2. 3 with the kind of elastomer...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND The use of {{personal}} computers (PCs) and the Internet {{to provide health}} care information and interventions has increased substantially over the past decade. Yet the effectiveness of such an approach is highly dependent upon whether the target population has both access and the skill set required to use this technology. This is particularly relevant in the delivery of hearing health care because most people with hearing loss are over 50 years (average age for initial hearing aid fitting is 74 years). Although PC skill and Internet use by demographic factors have been examined previously, data do not currently exist that examine the effects of hearing difficulties on PC skill or Internet use in older adults. OBJECTIVE To explore the effect that hearing difficulty has on PC skill and Internet use in an opportunistic sample of adults aged 50 - 74 years. METHODS Postal questionnaires about hearing difficulty, PC skill, and Internet use (n= 3629) were distributed to adults aged 50 - 74 years through three family physician practices in Nottingham, United Kingdom. A subsample of 84 respondents completed a second detailed questionnaire on confidence in using a keyboard, mouse, and <b>track</b> <b>pad.</b> Summed scores were termed the "PC confidence index.

40|$|The AVI {{conferences}} started here, in Rome on 1992, {{and were}} held {{every two years}} since then. The broad area of HCI has been expanding {{due to the fact}} that more persons wanted/needed to use computers, personal (one for each person) and now public as in Ambient Intelligence applications where the computing chips are integrated with the environment. In all applications on computing systems, the essential, wanted working feature, is how to make interaction simple both when learning it and using it so as to find the best way to interact with it. It is here that the interface plays a fundamental role and our conferences have suggested modeling, implementing and evaluating different suggested designs. Starting from the users, their habits and expectations and ending (or even redesigning) after usability testing. Many different cultures are brought together in this process: computer scientists, information architects, psychologists and semiologists: they are all involved since the background knowledge of users (technical, artistic, humanistic, etc) plays an important role in understanding (and remembering), how to use a computer application.

40|$|Since the {{invention}} of the computer mouse interface there have been no major changes in its design. The way we interact with computers through keyboards and mice are still the same as they first were. Recent new technologies try to replace or emulate the mouse and each have their own disadvantages. Some require the use of surfaces, cameras, sensor bars, or tethering. Other technologies are gesture based, require training, and are not intuitive. Not only is there the need for a mouse interface that is intuitive and convenient, but advancements in the field of human computer interfacing, especially using electromyogram (EMG) sensors, further open doors. The objective of this project is to design and create a wearable computer mouse interface, independent of cameras, sensor bars, surfaces, or tethering, that is intuitive, fast, accurate and convenient. This is accomplished by combining the output of both EMG sensors and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to control the cursor and clicking functions of a mouse. The goal is to be intuitive and accurate in order to overcome the shortcomings in existing technologies. ^ Many different muscles were examined as potential candidates for the EMG sensors. The output of each sensor was observed and several different sensor setups were chosen for focus. For each setup, at least one classifier configuration was designed in the attempt to obtain the highest testing accuracy. The angular velocity measurements of the z and y axis in the IMU were chosen to physically control the mouse cursor. Several different techniques were designed based on the different sensor setups and classifier configurations to obtain the highest overall system accuracy and fewest false positives. ^ Training data was collected in MatLab for processing. Time domain features were extracted and provided as input to a linear discriminant classifier. The implementation of the designs were programed in C++ for fast and efficient real-time performance. The setup and configuration with the highest training accuracy, highest testing accuracy, lowest false positive rate, and best overall IMU integration, was the setup with EMG sensors on the muscles: Extensor Carpi Radialis, Extensor Carpi Ulnaris, Flexor Carpi Ulnaris, Flexor Carpi Radialis, and Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (Near Wrist). One classifier took the input of all five channels for classification into a total of seven classes or actions: Rest, Up, Down, Left, Right, Left Click, and Right Click. This design took the least time to complete the accuracy program designed to evaluate the different configurations. This design also saw the lowest false positives. ^ Compared to a standard mouse or <b>track</b> <b>pad,</b> the best design still fell far short in performance. However, the common user has been using a standard mouse or <b>track</b> <b>pad</b> their whole life, and the need for time to practice with the device is expected. With practice, the design has the potential to match or come close to the accuracy of existing mice. With further automation of the training data collection and classifier training, the device would require little configuration to start using. Further development towards a commercial product would minimize the equipment required, the sensor setup time, and make the device no less convenient than a standard mouse. ^ One of the design goals at the forefront of this project, is the application and usability by hand amputees. Muscle locations are located in the forearm, and the IMU device located {{on the back of the}} wrist or forearm, allows hand amputees and those with hand disabilities to operate the device. ...|$|E
