5|$|The {{major areas}} that are highly {{productive}} and buildable are basically in Tablas and Sibuyan. These include Odiongan, San Andres, Looc and Santa Fe in Tablas Island. All three municipalities in Sibuyan Island, on the other hand, have substantial level <b>to</b> <b>gently</b> sloping lands. Overall, good developable lands represent about 13 percent of the province’s total area.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the ocellated electric ray is heart- or trowel-shaped and slightly wider than long. A pair of large, kidney-shaped electric organs are {{visible through the}} skin {{on either side of}} the head. The small eyes are followed by smaller spiracles, which have seven to ten small, rounded projections on their rims. The snout is broadly rounded, with each nostril divided into two openings by a strut. Between the nostrils is a curtain of skin with a smooth <b>to</b> <b>gently</b> wavy posterior margin. The small mouth forms a transverse line; the edge of the lower jaw is scalloped, and when closed usually conceals the teeth. There are 14–16 tooth rows in each jaw. The small and pointed teeth become progressively longer and sharper towards the back, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. Five pairs of small gill slits are present on the underside of the disc.|$|E

25|$|Maryland {{possesses}} {{a variety of}} topography within its borders, contributing to its nickname America in Miniature. It ranges from sandy dunes dotted with seagrass in the east, to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large bald cypress near the Chesapeake Bay, <b>to</b> <b>gently</b> rolling hills of oak forests in the Piedmont Region, and pine groves in the Maryland mountains to the west.|$|E

25|$|Southwest Australia is a {{biodiversity}} hotspot {{that includes}} the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub ecoregions of Western Australia. The region has a wet-winter, dry-summer Mediterranean climate, covers 356,717km², consisting of a coastal plain 20-120 kilometers wide, transitioning <b>to</b> <b>gently</b> undulating uplands made up of weathered granite, gneiss and laterite. Desert and xeric shrublands lie {{to the north and}} east across the center of Australia, separating Southwest Australia from the other Mediterranean and humid-climate regions of the continent.|$|E
25|$|Executed {{just above}} the runway, the flare arrests the aircraft's descent just prior to touchdown. By raising the aircraft's nose (pitching up) lift {{momentarily}} increases, reducing the descent rate, and allows the main wheels <b>to</b> <b>gently</b> contact the runway. During the flare, pilots retard the throttles to idle to reduce engine thrust. A squat switch in the main landing gear detects the touchdown and automatically deploys the spoilers, if armed. This destroys any remaining lift and helps the aircraft slow down.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} aspect of shyness is social skills development. Schools and parents may implicitly assume children are fully capable of effective social interaction. Social skills training is not given any priority (unlike reading and writing) and as a result, shy students are not {{given an opportunity to}} develop their ability to participate in class and interact with peers. Teachers can model social skills and ask questions in a less direct and intimidating manner in order <b>to</b> <b>gently</b> encourage shy students to speak up in class, and make friends with other children.|$|E

25|$|Kansas is {{underlain}} by {{a sequence}} of horizontal <b>to</b> <b>gently</b> westward dipping sedimentary rocks. A sequence of Mississippian, Pennsylvanian and Permian rocks outcrop in the eastern and {{southern part of the}} state. The state's western half has exposures of Cretaceous through Tertiary sediments, the latter derived from the erosion of the uplifted Rocky Mountains to the west. These are underlain by older Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments which correlate well with the outcrops to the east. The state's northeastern corner was subjected to glaciation in the Pleistocene and is covered by glacial drift and loess.|$|E
25|$|Folk medicine, {{including}} ancient medicine of Egyptians, Greeks, Celts, Turks, Slavs, Mayans, Aztecs and Chinese, {{has used}} bruising {{as a treatment}} for some health problems. The methods vary widely and include cupping, scraping, and slapping. Fire cupping uses suction which causes bruising in patients. Scraping (Gua Sha) uses a small hand device with a rounded edge <b>to</b> <b>gently</b> scrape the scalp or the skin. Another ancient device that creates mild bruising is a strigil, used by Greeks and Romans in the bath. Archaeologically there is no precedent for scraping tools before Greek archaeological evidence, not Chinese or Egyptian.|$|E
25|$|During the {{majority}} of the year caribou roam the tundra in small herds, but twice a year large herds of caribou cross the inland regions. Caribou have excellent senses of smell and hearing so that the hunters must be very careful when in pursuit. Often, Inuit hunters set up camp miles away from the caribou crossing and wait until they are in full view to attack. There are many ways in which the caribou can be captured, including spearing, forcing caribou into the river, using blinders, scaring the caribou, and stalking the caribou. When spearing caribou, hunters put the string of the spear in their mouths and the other end they use <b>to</b> <b>gently</b> spear the animal.|$|E

25|$|The {{general idea}} behind hydropathy during the 1800s {{was to be}} able to induce {{something}} called a crisis. The thinking was that water invaded any cracks, wounds, or imperfections in the skin, which were filled with impure fluids. health was considered to be the natural state of the body, and filling these spaces with pure water, would flush the impurities out, which would rise {{to the surface of the}} skin, producing pus. The event of this pus emerging was called a crisis, and was achieved through a multitude of methods. These methods included techniques such as sweating, the plunging bath, the half bath, the head bath, the sitting bath, and the douche bath. All of these were ways <b>to</b> <b>gently</b> expose the patient to cold water in different ways.|$|E
25|$|Many toothpastes make {{whitening}} claims. Some {{of these}} toothpastes contain peroxide, the same ingredient found in tooth bleaching gels. The abrasive in these toothpastes, not the peroxide, removes the stains. Whitening toothpaste cannot alter the natural color of teeth or reverse discoloration by penetrating surface stains or decay. To remove surface stains, whitening toothpaste may include abrasives <b>to</b> <b>gently</b> polish the teeth or additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate {{to break down}} or dissolve stains. When used twice a day, whitening toothpaste typically takes two to four weeks to make teeth appear whiter. Whitening toothpaste is generally safe for daily use, but excessive use might damage tooth enamel. Teeth whitening gels represent an alternative. However, the whitening process can permanently reduce {{the strength of the}} teeth, as the process scrapes away a protective outer layer of enamel.|$|E

500|$|The roughtail {{stingray}} has a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disk 1.2–1.3 times {{as wide as}} long, with straight <b>to</b> <b>gently</b> [...] margins, rather angular outer corners, and a moderately long, obtuse snout. The eyes are proportionally smaller than other stingrays in its range and immediately followed by larger spiracles. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils with a finely fringed posterior margin. The mouth is bow-shaped with a row of six papillae (nipple-like structures) across the floor. The seven upper and 12–14 lower tooth rows at the center are functional, though {{the total number of}} tooth rows is much greater. The teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces; each has a tetragonal base with a blunt crown in juveniles and females, and a pointed cusp in adult males.|$|E
