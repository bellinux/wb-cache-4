To test this theory, the thesis compares the frames that define al Qaeda's collective identity with those of the Sudanese National Islamic Front and the Afghan Taliban to see if observed variation in haven resiliency can be explained by the levels of shared collective identities in each case.

Replaced new revision 02 / 24 / 2014 More {{than a decade}} after the attacks on 9 / 11, United States leadership continues to place a high priority on pursuing terrorists and denying them safe havens from which they can recruit, train, and plan operations. In a time of decreasing budgets and growing sentiment avidly against involvement in prolonged wars, the U. S. must adapt strategies to meet the future threats posed by <b>terrorist</b> safe <b>havens.</b> This thesis offers strategies for countering safe havens. It begins by arguing that safe havens are not just geographic areas, but that they also include a demographic component that allows terrorists a population among which to hide. The thesis then presents four strategies aimed at denying geographic and demographic safe havens: leadership targeting within safe havens, tactical containment, pseudo operations, and surrogate security forces. The thesis draws from four historical case studies to examine these strategies, including the Peruvian governments efforts to combat the Shining Path, French containment of the Casbah in Algerias war of independence, Rhodesias Selous Scouts experience with pseudo operations, and U. S. co-option of the Sons of Iraq in Anbar Province. The thesis finds that no single strategy is sufficient for dealing with geographic and demographic safe havens. Rather, a combination of strategies, properly sequenced, can reduce <b>terrorist</b> safe <b>havens.</b> Furthermore, none of these strategies works without counterinsurgency forces positively engaging the population, setting the necessary conditions for separating insurgents from their demographic and geographic supports.

The thesis finds that geography has a strong influence {{on the creation of}} safe havens, particularly terrain that is difficult to access, as does weak federal governance and strong tribal societies. Furthermore, both Kabylia and the FATA have suffered chronic instability, which has provided opportunities for terrorists to establish safe havens. External influences have also {{played an important role in}} both areas by creating competing loyalties that have weakened the legitimacy of the federal government in the area, thus helping to create favorable conditions for <b>terrorist</b> safe <b>havens.</b> Socioeconomic conditions were not a consistent cause of safe havens in this study, nor was the presence of international borders.

40|$|ISIS’s {{cultivation}} of social media has reinforced states’ interest in using automated surveillance. However, automated surveillance using artificial intelligence (“machine learning”) techniques has also sharpened privacy concerns {{that have been}} acute since Edward Snowden’s disclosures. This Article examines machine-based surveillance by the NSA and other intelligence agencies {{through the prism of}} international human rights. Two camps have clashed on the human rights implications of machine surveillance abroad. The state-centric camp argues that human rights agreements like the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) do not apply extraterritorially. Moreover, the state-centric camp insists, machine surveillance is inherently unintrusive, like a dog seeing a human step out of the shower. Surveillance critics respond that machine and human access to data are equivalent invasions of privacy and legal protections must be equal for individuals within a state’s borders and nonnationals overseas. In a controversial recent decision, Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner, the European Court of Justice appeared to side with surveillance’s critics. This Article argues that both the state-centric and critical positions are flawed. This Article agrees with surveillance critics that the ICCPR applies extraterritorially. Machine access to data can cause both ontological harm, stemming from individuals’ loss of spontaneity, and consequential harm, stemming from errors that machines compound in databases such as no-fly lists. However, the Schrems decision went too far by failing to acknowledge that human rights law provides states with a measure of deference in confronting threats such as ISIS. Deference on overseas surveillance is particularly appropriate given U. N. Security Council resolutions urging states to deny <b>terrorists</b> safe <b>havens.</b> But deference cannot be absolute. To provide appropriate safeguards, this Article recommends that machine searches abroad be tailored to compelling state purposes, scientifically validated, and subject to independent review...|$|R
40|$|After the {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11 th the United States invaded Afghanistan and overthrew the Taliban in a quick and decisive war, effectively destroying the <b>terrorist</b> safe <b>haven</b> in the country. However, eight years later the U. S. and members of the international community remain there trying to keep terrorists and extremists from reestablishing their base in Afghanistan. To date we have only reached a fragile stalemate between the insurgency, composed of the Taliban and supported by al Qaeda, and the ISAF and U. S. forces within the country. Many argue we should give up in Afghanistan, believing our problems can be attributed to a poor strategy, a lack of resources, a lack of focus, or simply an unwinnable war. However, we now have a new President, a new commander in Afghanistan, and a new strategy that many have touted as a first step toward victory. This thesis examines the history of the battle for stability in Afghanistan, the history of insurgencies in the country, and other major issues challenging the rebuilding and stability of the failed state. The intent of this thesis is to contribute a further understanding of the conflict and challenges present in Afghanistan and its surrounding region. The effectiveness of the Obama administration's new strategy and direction in Afghanistan is also examined. While the new strategy is a step forward in Afghanistan, it is far from a silver bullet. Any victory still requires a true long-term commitment to the fight for stability in Afghanistan, the proper resources for the security of the Afghan people and an effective effort to eliminate the safe haven that now exists in Pakistan. Significant progress is achievable within the region. However, even if the Obama plan works as outlined true stability and success will not occur unless the U.

40|$|State failure’ {{has become}} a part of the global post‐ 9 / 11 {{security}} calculus. Faltering states are presented as dangers to international stability, as <b>terrorist</b> safe <b>havens</b> and as ‘black holes’ of global politics. However, the political and academic debate about this phenomenon still leaves much to be desired. This working paper and its companion piece (INEF Report 88 / 2006) try to revisit the phenomenon from new perspectives. The focus of ʺState Failure Revisited Iʺ is on the globalization of security and neighborhood effects. ʺRethinking State Failure: The Political Economy of Securityʺ by Pinar Bilgin/Adam David Morton argues that the relationship between ‘state failure’ and globalization is not adequately theorized. Their contribution details several problematic assumptions linked to the dominant discourse on ‘state failure’ including the unreflexive attitude to both scholarship and policy‐making that it reveals; the view that globalization is understood and represented as an ‘out there’ phenomenon, whereas it is very much an ‘in here’ occurrence; and the manner in which it reduces the security dimension of globalization to the threat posed by terrorism to state security, thereby failing to move away from a statecentric account. In contrast, Bilgin/Morton lay out the contours of an alternative framework to state ‘failure’ that is attentive to the conditions of uneven development of accumulation patterns and the importation of ‘Western’ models of sovereign territoriality in non‐Western locales. The regional impact of state failure – in contrast to its global implications – has only received scant attention in academic and policy debates. To introduce the regional level into the analysis, Daniel Lambach in his contribution ʺClose Encounters in the Third Dimensionʺ develops a basic model to understand the transnational interaction between national processes of failure and consolidation in neighboring states. The deductively constructed model differentiates between structural and dynamic cross‐border linkages. A plausibility test of the model is undertaken with evidence from four countries in West Africa. The case study substantiates the hypotheses underlying the model, thus confirming its general applicability to other cases...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. A {{fundamental}} driving {{factor to}} contemporary international terrorism {{is the role}} of religion. Since the 1980 s, there have been not only a {{rise in the number of}} Islamist terrorist incidents but also of a more globalized and intense dimension. The casualties have risen to unprecedented levels. Africa, and the Horn of Africa, in particular, has experienced its fair share of terrorist activities. For instance, in December 1980 terrorists sympathetic to the PLO bombed the Norfolk Hotel, owned by an Israeli, in Nairobi, Kenya, killing sixteen people and injuring over a hundred. The 7 August 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were more deadly: 240 Kenyans, 11 Tanzanians and 12 Americans died, with over 5, 000 Kenyans and 86 Tanzanians injured. There was yet another terrorist attack on another Israeli-owned hotel in Mombassa and an attempt on a passenger plane on the runway at the Mombassa International Airport, Kenya. Both incidents happened in November 2002. Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the 1998 and 2002 attacks. With rising terrorism in the Horn of Africa and the reality of the Somali state failure, there is a growing concern that the Somali environment is supporting terrorist activities in the region. The activities of the al-Itihad al-Islamiya (AIAI) and later the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), the Somali Islamist fundamentalist organizations, with their feared international connections and the security implications, are of concern not only to the region but also to global security monitors. There is not much debate regarding the level of collapse of the Somali state and the possible security implications of the territory as a congenial <b>terrorist</b> safe <b>haven.</b> Most experts have presented Somalia as a clear example of a completely failed state. Rotberg (2002 : 131) describes Somalia as “the model of a collapsed state: a geographical expression only, with borders but with no effective way to exert authority within those borders". Jhazbhay (2003 : 77) quoted Ali Mazrui as saying that "the situation in Somalia now is a culture of rules without rulers, a stateless society‟. Menkhaus (2003 : 27) has singled out protracted and complete state collapse, protracted armed conflict and lawlessness as aptly representing the Somali situation. “Somalia‟s inability to pull together even the most minimalist fig-leaf of a central administration over the course of twelve years places the country in a class by itself...|$|R
40|$|Since 2004, the CIA {{has been}} engaged in a covert {{campaign}} using remotely-operated drones to conduct targeted killings of suspected al-Qaeda and Taliban militants in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region. The rapid escalation of this programme under the Obama administration has attracted the close attention {{of the media and}} of academic experts working in the foreign policy, defence and legal fields. However, while such attention has enhanced our understanding of the scale, effectiveness and legality of drone warfare, there has been little attempt to explain the origins of the programme and place it within wider US counterterrorism practice. This dissertation meets that need, making an original contribution to the study of American counterterrorism by tracing the historical origins of the programme back to a small but influential group of policy makers within the Reagan administration. The thesis reveals how a shared hardline vision of how best to deal with terrorists set in motion legal and technological developments which eventually culminated in the CIA’s drone programme three decades later. By identifying the parallels between the drone campaign and the demands of the hardliners within Reagan’s government, the thesis challenges the commonly held notion that the CIA’s entry into drone warfare marks an unprecedented escalation of US counterterrorism practices resulting from a post- 9 / 11 mind-set. Instead it presents evidence that current US counterterrorism practice {{is the result of a}} gradual evolution over the past three decades. Rather than placing the focus upon the drones themselves, this historical review reveals that the CIA’s unmanned aircraft are simply the current tool which enables the United States to pursue the counterterrorism goal it has held for decades – the ability to unilaterally neutralize anti-American <b>terrorists</b> in safe <b>havens</b> around the world. The thesis reveals that the drone campaign should not be regarded as a product of post- 9 / 11 policy, nor the result of the seductive nature of remote control warfare. Instead, the use of drones should be seen as the embodiment of America’s long-term counterterrorism goal...|$|R
