40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{revisions}} in inflation expectations on <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> UK inflation-indexed and conventional government bonds with a vector autoregressive (VAR) model. Downwards revisions of inflation expectations are associated with unexpected increases in <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> conventional bonds, but <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> indexed bonds are not significantly affected. This suggests that indexed bonds protect investors against inflation while nominal bonds are exposed to changing monetary conditions.
