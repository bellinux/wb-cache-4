5|$|The only goal of {{the match}} came in the second half; Arsenal {{substitute}} Gilberto Silva on his debut collected a pass from Dennis Bergkamp and struck the ball through goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek's legs. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger praised the match-winner in his post-match interview, while opposing manager Gérard Houllier felt <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> his team needed more game time and attention to passing, in order to improve. The result meant Arsenal was {{the first team to}} win the Shield outright 11 times, while it marked Liverpool's first defeat at the Millennium Stadium.|$|E

Manchester United went ahead seven minutes {{before the end of}} the first half, but late goals from Kanu and Ray Parlour gave Arsenal victory in the match. Wenger {{believed}} <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> his team were [...] "ready for the season" [...] and thought it was [...] "...psychologically important to beat United, especially after the great run they have had".|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the Illinois Primary, Goldwater {{traveled}} to Chicago {{and announced that}} he would change the campaign's media policy to avoid overexposure to the press, which he believed was reporting negatively on his campaign. He won the Illinois primary with 64 percent of the vote and gained most of the state's 48 delegates, but the victory was overshadowed by the 25 percent performance by long-shot candidate Margaret Smith. Goldwater's total was lower than the 80 percent that was expected. However, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> Goldwater could win in a populous northern state, though a survey of newspaper publishers predicted that most of the Goldwater delegates would end up switching to the still-undecided Nixon. Goldwater remained confident that he would win the nomination, but continued to feel that overcoming Nixon would be his [...] "last hurdle".|$|E

500|$|The result {{marked the}} first time that Manchester United had lost in the {{calendar}} year, ending a 33-match unbeaten run. Wenger believed <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> Arsenal were [...] "ready for the season", albeit admitting that the defence had trouble coping with Yorke. He thought it was [...] "...psychologically important to beat United, especially after the great run they have had". Wenger confirmed afterwards that Anelka would sign for Real Madrid: [...] "I hope everything will be finalised {{in the next couple of}} days. In any case, he is not coming back here, and although the contract is not signed yet, I hope it will be after his medical and that is the end of it." [...] Kanu, who scored Arsenal's equaliser and set up the match winner, was pleased with his performance and relished the opportunity of establishing himself in the first team, after Anelka's departure.|$|E
500|$|The result marked Manchester United's first Shield {{defeat in}} 13 years, {{and was the}} ninth time Arsenal had won the Charity Shield. Arsenal became the first {{southern}} club since Tottenham Hotspur in 1962 to win the Shield outright. Wenger described the scoreline as [...] "unexpected" [...] and cited the first goal as crucial in the match, given the weather conditions. He was content with how his international players, {{who had been in}} the World Cup, coped with the game's physicality. Wenger believed the result gave Arsenal a psychological boost for the Champions League campaign, as the club planned to stage their home matches at Wembley Stadium. Bergkamp felt <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> Arsenal had what it took to retain the Premier League title: [...] "We've still got the same mentality and that will be the basis for this year's challenge. This is a good start. It is harder to retain the trophy." ...|$|E
500|$|Scientists at Oxford University {{reported}} the self-assembly of four short strands of synthetic DNA into a cage which can enter cells and survive {{for at least}} 48 hours. [...] The fluorescently labeled DNA tetrahedra were found to remain intact in the laboratory cultured human kidney cells despite the attack by cellular enzymes after two days. [...] This experiment showed the potential of drug delivery inside the living cells using the DNA ‘cage’. [...] A DNA tetrahedron was used to deliver RNA Interference (RNAi) in a mouse model, reported {{a team of researchers}} in MIT. [...] Delivery of the interfering RNA for treatment has showed some success using polymer or lipid, but there are limits of safety and imprecise targeting, in addition to short shelf life in the blood stream. [...] The DNA nanostructure created by the team consists of six strands of DNA to form a tetrahedron, with one strand of RNA affixed to each of the six edges. [...] The tetrahedron is further equipped with targeting protein, three folate molecules, which lead the DNA nanoparticles to the abundant folate receptors found on some tumors. [...] <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the gene expression targeted by the RNAi, luciferase, dropped by more than half. [...] This study shows promise in using DNA nanotechnology as an effective tool to deliver treatment using the emerging RNA Interference technology.|$|E

The British fleet was assembling. The {{ultimatum}} had not yet expired, but {{it was evident that}} a blow would be struck the instant that it did. Four of their aeroplanes, circling at an immense height, were surveying our defences. From the top of the lighthouse I counted thirty battleships and cruisers in the offing, with a number of the trawlers with which in the British service they break through the mine-fields.

Even Susquesus, who had been lounging about the whole day, or since his liberation, had vanished. Prudence and her daughters, too, were in a great commotion, hurrying from cabin to cabin, and manifesting all that restlessness which usually denotes excitement among females. I stopped but a moment to ascertain these leading circumstances, and turned to seek the rock. While retiring from among the bushes, I heard the fallen branch of a tree snap under a heavy footstep, and looking cautiously around, saw Jaaf, or Jaap as we commonly called him, advancing toward me, carrying a rifle on each shoulder.|$|E
60|$|The Afghan troops facing General Roberts' column, {{when they}} found their comrades on their right retreating, began to draw off, and the fire sensibly diminished. The {{movement}} was accelerated by the four elephant guns--which had, at length, come up--opening fire into the pine-wood forest. As the fire slackened, a reconnaissance of the hill was made by General Roberts and his staff; but <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the mountain was so covered with pines, and brushwood, that it formed an almost impenetrable barrier to the advance of troops--for the growth was so thick {{that it was impossible}} to say in which direction any movement should be made. The experience gained, in the last six hours of hard fighting, had shown how difficult it was to keep command over troops scattered along a front of half a mile long, in the forest, where nothing could be seen beyond a radius of a few yards.|$|E
60|$|Crossed and self-fertilised {{seeds from}} the above plants, after germinating on bare sand, were planted in pairs on the {{opposite}} sides of five large pots. The seedlings thus raised were the grandchildren of the plants which grew in Brazil; the parents having been grown in England. As the grandparents in Brazil absolutely require cross-fertilisation in order to yield any seeds, I expected that self-fertilisation would have proved very injurious to these seedlings, and that the crossed ones would have been greatly superior in height and vigour to those raised from self-fertilised flowers. But <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> my anticipation was erroneous; for as in the last experiment with plants of the English stock, so in the present one, the self-fertilised plants exceeded the crossed by a little in height. It will be sufficient to state that the fourteen crossed plants averaged 44.64, and the fourteen self-fertilised 45.12 inches in height; or as 100 to 101.|$|E
