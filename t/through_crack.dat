50|$|As {{with natural}} bone, the primary issue with bone {{scaffolds}} is brittle failure. They typically follow linear elastic behavior, and under compressive forces experiences a plateau and recovery reminiscent of cellular solids {{as well as}} trabecular bone. The elastic modulus of natural bone ranges from 10 to 20 GPa; it requires a high stiffness to withstand constant mechanical load. Bone scaffolds must therefore be as stiff as natural bone, or the scaffold will fail <b>through</b> <b>crack</b> nucleation and propagation before the host tissue can regenerate. However, if the scaffold is significantly stiffer than the surrounding tissue, the elastic mismatch and continuity at the scaffold boundary with cause strain in the natural bone and could create unwanted defects.|$|E

A dynamic plate theory is developed {{which includes the}} effects of material inhomogeneity in the thickness direction and realistic crack edge stress singularity and distribution.

40|$|The {{interaction}} {{problem of}} a through or a part <b>through</b> <b>crack</b> with a stress free boundary in a semi-infinite cylindrical shell is considered. It is assumed that the crack lies in a meridional plane which is a plane of symmetry {{with respect to the}} external loads as well as the geometry. The circular boundary of the semi-infinite cylinder is assumed to be stress free. By using a transverse shear theory the problem is formulated in terms of a system of singular integral equations. The line spring model is used to treat the part <b>through</b> <b>crack</b> problem. In the case of a <b>through</b> <b>crack</b> the interaction between the perturbed stress fields due to the crack and the free boundary is quite strong and there is a considerable increase in the stress intensity factors caused by the interaction. On the other hand in the {{problem of a}} surface crack the interaction appears to be much weaker and consequently the magnification in the stress intensity factors is much less significant...|$|E

40|$|A dynamic {{approximate}} {{laminated plate}} theory is developed with {{emphasis placed on}} obtaining effective solution for the crack configuration where the 1 /square root of r stress singularity and the condition of plane strain are preserved. The radial distance r is measured from the crack edge. The results obtained show that the crack moment intensity tends to decrease as the crack length to laminate plate thickness is increased. Hence, a laminated plate has the desirable feature of stabilizing a <b>through</b> <b>crack</b> as it increases its length at constant load. Also, {{the level of the}} average load intensity transmitted to a <b>through</b> <b>crack</b> can be reduced by making the inner layers to be stiffer than the outer layers.

Understanding and measuring transport <b>through</b> <b>cracked</b> concrete is important for describing the initial condition of radioactive waste containment structures at the Savannah River Site (SRS) and for predicting performance of these structures over time. This report transmits {{the results of a}} literature review on transport <b>through</b> <b>cracked</b> concrete which was performed by Professor Jason Weiss, Purdue University per SRR 0000678 (RFP-RQ 00001029 -WY). This review complements the NRC-sponsored literature review and assessment of factors relevant to performance of grouted systems for radioactive waste disposal. This review was performed by The Center for Nuclear Waste Regulatory Analyses, San Antonio, TX, and The University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen Scotland and was focused on tank closure. The objective of the literature review on transport <b>through</b> <b>cracked</b> concrete was to identify information in the open literature which can be applied to SRS transport models for cementitious containment structures, fills, and waste forms. In addition, the literature review was intended to: (1) Provide a framework for describing and classifying cracks in containment structures and cementitious materials used in radioactive waste disposal, (2) Document the state of knowledge and research related to transport <b>through</b> <b>cracks</b> in concrete for various exposure conditions, (3) Provide information or methodology for answering several specific questions related to cracking and transport in concrete, and (4) Provide information {{that can be used to}} design experiments on transport <b>through</b> <b>cracked</b> samples and actual structures...|$|R

In order to get reliable results, short-term and long term experiments were set up and chloride penetration behaviour <b>through</b> <b>cracks</b> was examined. It was noticed that chloride penetration <b>through</b> <b>cracks</b> tends to decrease with time. One of the explanations is crack-healing. Especially, this trend was obvious in concrete samples with larger crack width. However, measuring the border between chloride contaminated zone and healthy zone was clear in concrete of short-term experiment, while it was ambiguous in long term experiment...|$|R

Additional convective transport takes place due to a difference of hydrostatic pressure in both cells.

40|$|The general {{problem of}} a shallow shell with {{constant}} curvatures is considered. It is assumed that the shell contains an arbitrarily oriented <b>through</b> <b>crack</b> and the material is specially orthotropic. The nonsymmetric problem is solved for arbitrary self equilibrating crack surface tractions, which, added to an appropriate solution for an uncracked shell, would give the result for a cracked shell under most general loading conditions. The problem is reduced {{to a system of}} five singular integral equations in a set of unknown functions representing relative displacements and rotations on the crack surfaces. The stress state around the crack tip is asymptotically analyzed and it is shown that the results are identical to those obtained from the two dimensional in plane and antiplane elasticity solutions. The numerical results are given for a cylindrical shell containing an arbitrarily oriented <b>through</b> <b>crack.</b> Some sample results showing the effect of the Poisson's ratio and the material orthotropy are also presented...|$|E

40|$|A {{cylindrical}} shell {{having a very}} stiff and plate or a flange is considered. It is assumed that near the end the cylinder contains an axial flaw which may be modeled as a part through surface crack or a <b>through</b> <b>crack.</b> The effect of the end constraining on the stress intensity factor which is the main fracture mechanics parameter is studied. The applied loads acting on the cylinder {{are assumed to be}} axisymmetric. Thus the crack problem under consideration is symmetric with respect to the plane of the crack and consequently only the Mode 1 stress intensity factors are nonzero. With this limitation, the general perturbation problem for a cylinder with a built in end containing an axial crack is considered. Reissner's shell theory is used to formulate the problem. The part <b>through</b> <b>crack</b> problem is treated by using a line spring model. In the case of a crack tip terminating at the fixed end it is shown that the integral equations of the shell problem has the same generalized Cauchy kernel as the corresponding plane stress elasticity problem...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a research program conducted to enable accurate prediction {{of the impact}} tolerance of the shuttle Orbiter leading-edge wing panels using physics-based codes such as LS-DYNA, a nonlinear, explicit transient dynamic finite element code. The shuttle leading-edge panels are constructed of Reinforced-Carbon-Carbon (RCC) composite material, which is used because of its thermal properties to protect the shuttle during reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. Accurate predictions of impact damage from insulating foam and other debris strikes that occur during launch required materials characterization of expected debris, including strain-rate effects. First, analytical models of individual foam and RCC materials were validated. Next, analytical models of foam cylinders impacting 6 - in. x 6 -in. RCC flat plates were developed and validated. LS-DYNA pre-test models of the RCC flat plate specimens established the impact velocity of the test for three damage levels: no-detectable damage, non-destructive evaluation (NDE) detectable damage, or visible damage such as a <b>through</b> <b>crack</b> or hole. Finally, the threshold of impact damage for RCC on representative Orbiter wing panels was predicted for both a small <b>through</b> <b>crack</b> and for NDE-detectable damage...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} a laminated timber arch radially reinforced with composite fiber rods to arrest crack growth. A laminated arch with a <b>through</b> <b>crack</b> was instrumented with crack propagations gages to detect crack growth and was tested experimentally. A finite element model was developed, which represented the laminated timber arch and the reinforcing rods, and used two dimensional interface elements to simulate crack extension. The arch was modeled with a flaw {{in the form of}} a <b>through</b> <b>crack</b> that was assumed to be sharp. Material properties of the arch and rods were determined experimentally, and the crack dimensions in the model were taken from the experimental arch, which was measured using an X-ray emitter with 33 µm resolution. The experimental results (deformations, strains and crack growth) were compared with the analyses. The model showed reasonable agreement with the experiment but an improved model is required to capture the behavior correctly. This paper demonstrates the possibilities in reinforcing wood structural members using high-strength composites and points to some experimental and analytical challenges...|$|E
