5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress {{was very careful}} to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that {{is all that is}} needed to decide the case, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under the constitution to authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians. Finally, Kennedy was concerned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> did not address the question of the Equal Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{made two}} {{arguments}} for the dissenting justices: that predisposition was proven {{by the fact}} that Jacobson had ordered materials both times he was actually solicited, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> had usurped the jury's rightful role in deciding whether he was entrapped. She also expressed fears <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> had so broadened the definition of predisposition as to make it a viable defense in almost any case.|$|E
5|$|The added italics show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> perverted {{the honest}} intent of his letters, and {{extended}} to him their grace {{based on an}} admission he never made.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court's</b> dissenting members argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> had no {{jurisdiction}} {{to question the}} constitutionality of a treaty which had not been incorporated into {{the law of the}} state. While they agreed with <b>the</b> majority <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> could interfere with the government's exercise of the state's foreign affairs {{in the case of a}} clear disregard of the Constitution, they did not agree <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government had shown any such disregard.|$|R
5|$|As a Justice, Black {{held the}} view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> should {{literally}} enforce constitutional guarantees, especially the First Amendment free speech clause. He was often labeled an ‘activist’ {{because of his}} willingness to review legislation that arguably violated constitutional provisions. Black maintained that literalism was necessary to cabin judicial power.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice Melville Fuller {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on May 21, 1900. This opinion held that there were no federal issues in question in the case, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> lacked jurisdiction. The opinion affirmed the state court of appeals' assertion that an elective office was not property. Justices Gray, White, Shiras, and Peckham concurred with the majority opinion.|$|E
5|$|France2 {{appealed to}} the Court of Cassation (supreme court). In February 2012 it quashed the {{decision}} of the appeal court to overturn the conviction, ruling <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> should not have asked France2 to provide the raw footage. The case was sent back to the appeal court, which convicted Karsenty of defamation in 2013 and fined him €7,000.|$|E
50|$|A lengthy term of imprisonment, {{sanctioned by}} <b>the</b> <b>court,</b> {{would also have}} served another {{important}} purpose. It would send a strong message to <b>the</b> country <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> would not tolerate the commission of serious crimes in South Africa perpetrated in consequence of racist and intolerant values inconsistent with the ethos to which the Constitution committed <b>the</b> nation, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> would deal severely with offenders guilty of such conduct.|$|R
5000|$|Before the First Circuit, the Mashpee argued: (1) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{district}} <b>court</b> {{should have}} granted their motion for a continuance; (2) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> district <b>court</b> erred in instructing the jury on {{the definition of}} a [...] "tribe"; (3) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> district <b>court</b> erred in allocating the burden of proof to <b>the</b> Mashpee; (4) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> district <b>court</b> erred in not granting a new trial {{on the basis of the}} special verdict; and (5) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> district <b>court</b> erred in its handing of ex parte communication with a juror.|$|R

5|$|In December 2013, a court denied Rajab {{early release}} {{after he had}} served three {{quarters}} of his sentence. According to Bahraini law, a prisoner may be eligible for early release after serving {{three quarters of the}} sentence. Rajab's lawyer stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> gave no reason for rejecting early release.|$|E
5|$|In most appeals, {{the parties}} argue {{opposing}} positions. In this case, both the appellee (the Menominee) and the appellant (the United States) {{argued that the}} decision of the Court of Claims should be affirmed. The State of Wisconsin, as amicus curiae, argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Claims ruling should be reversed.|$|E
5|$|Many {{planters}} {{refused to}} comply with their provisions. The confrontation continued as the planters challenged on several occasions the right of British government to pass laws binding on the colony, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Policy has exclusive legislative power within the colony. Plantation owners who controlled the voting of the taxes disrupted administration by refusing to vote the civil list.|$|E

5|$|Newspapers {{in major}} {{international}} cities and Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and socialist publications reported outrage about the verdict and strong criticism of American society. Southern newspapers, particularly in Mississippi, wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> system had done its job. Till's story {{continued to make}} the news for weeks following the trial, especially sparking debate among Southern, Northern, and black newspapers, the NAACP and various high-profile segregationists about justice for blacks and the propriety of Jim Crow society.|$|E
5|$|The Chng Suan Tze {{decision}} is more notable {{for the issues}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal discussed obiter dicta, having already allowed the appeals {{on the ground that}} the respondents had not discharged their burden of proving the President's satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|Warren {{convened a}} meeting of the justices, and {{presented}} to them the simple argument that the only reason to sustain segregation was an honest belief in the inferiority of Negroes. Warren further submitted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> must overrule Plessy to maintain its legitimacy as an institution of liberty, and it must do so unanimously to avoid massive Southern resistance. He began to build a unanimous opinion.|$|E
50|$|Brennan, concurring, {{expressed}} <b>the</b> view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>court's</b> decision left undisturbed <b>the</b> <b>court's</b> retroactivity precedents {{as applied}} to convictions final {{at the time of}} decision.|$|R
2500|$|Scalia also {{believed}} <b>that</b> under <b>the</b> <b>Court's</b> ruling, {{it would not}} be an abuse of discretion for a district court to override an affirmative waiver of the defense by <b>the</b> State, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court's</b> assertion to <b>the</b> contrary was [...] "without relevant citation or reasoning." ...|$|R

5|$|A {{week after}} the crash, the {{families}} of various passengers aboard Flight 706 began filing lawsuits and court papers against Hughes Airwest and, later, {{the government of the}} United States. The first filing was by the family of Keith A. Gabel, which filed a motion to perpetuate testimony in the Central District of California on June 16, 1971. This motion requests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> issue a court order for a person's deposition to be taken, and can be done prior to a lawsuit being filed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.|$|E
5|$|Errors as to {{precedent}} facts, {{sometimes called}} jurisdictional facts, in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by public authorities concerning facts that must objectively exist or not exist before the authorities {{have the power}} to take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors of fact is an exception to the general rule <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> only reviews errors of law.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Burton {{argued that}} the Eastern District of Missouri was an unconstitutional venue and vicinage (an {{argument}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> had accepted in Burton I). This time, the Court rejected the argument. The Court held that the agreement had occurred in St. Louis (as the jury had been instructed that it was required to find) based on Rialto's acceptance in St. Louis, the telegram, and the letter. The Court bolstered this view by citation to its own and other precedents concerning offer and acceptance in contract law. The Court further cited its earlier precedents holding that the venue provision of Article III {{does not require the}} physical presence of the defendant in the forum state.|$|E
50|$|Harte-Hanks appealed, again {{citing the}} First Amendment defense against libel. The Sixth Circuit affirmed <b>the</b> lower <b>court's</b> {{decision}} however, writing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>court's</b> ruling did not encroach upon the First Amendment rights of <b>the</b> publisher, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>court</b> was not incorrect in labeling the article as defamatory and false.|$|R

50|$|Judge Wiley Blount Rutledge was {{concerned}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court's</b> decision was narrowly construing the great writ of habeas corpus.|$|R
5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue {{that will have to}} be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> would have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E
5|$|Gaudron, and jointly Gleeson, Gummow and Hayne, {{decided that}} the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 validly conferred the {{jurisdiction}} to determine disputed elections on the High Court, in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns. They said that if Hill's argument about {{the structure of the}} Act were correct, there would be the odd result <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> could hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Act itself (which imposes certain requirements for candidates), but it {{would not be able to}} hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Constitution. They also said that if only a house of Parliament could dispute a candidate's constitutional eligibility, then in the time it took for that house to determine the issue, an ineligible candidate would be able to participate in the business of that house, including passing laws and other activities.|$|E
5|$|Historically the King of the Welsh {{people would}} travel, with his court, in a circuit, {{demanding}} tribute {{in the form}} of food from communities they visited as they went. The tribute was codified in the Laws of Hywel Dda, showing that people lived on beer, bread, meat and dairy products, with few vegetables beyond cabbages and leeks. The laws show how much value was put on different parts of Welsh life at the time, for example that wealth was measured in cattle; they also show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> included hunters, who would be restricted to seasonal hunting sessions.|$|E
50|$|It {{is a basic}} {{principle}} of <b>the</b> common law <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> are to treat trap evidence with caution.|$|R
5000|$|There is some {{authority}} for <b>the</b> proposition <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> employ a normative legal concept of [...] "moral desert". Dr Kennefick of Queen's College, Oxford has posited <b>that</b> <b>the</b> essential question <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> ask themselves is this: [...] "did they deserve it?" [...] When both parties deserve it, the secondary inquiry is [...] "who deserved it more?" [...] On the unlikely occurrence of equal moral desert existing between two parties, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> should, Kennefick argues, {{be able to}} give both parties a remedy.|$|R
