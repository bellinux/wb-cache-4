500|$|Meanwhile, Jack, {{who serves}} as Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric (GE), travels to Washington, D.C., to {{participate}} in a task force on microwaves as the industry is struggling, but he says he refuses to take any bailout money. He believes <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>will</b> be quite simple and quick, but once there he is confronted by Devon Banks (Will Arnett) who has begun working with the federal government. Devon reveals that he has spent the last year since being fired from GE in [...] "Do-Over" [...] working to get back at Jack by making connections in the Barack Obama administration through a friendship with the president's daughters, Sasha and Malia. Devon leaks Jack's controversial testimony from the hearing, believing that public pressure will force Jack to resign in three days. Jack spends that time asking the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff writers—Frank, Lutz, and James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell)—to come up with an idea [...] "as good as the light bulb" [...] to improve the microwave. They try to incorporate suggestions such as making the microwave bigger or making them break down more often so they require replacement, but Jack eventually abandons the project as a failure. However, instead of leaving GE, Jack convinces Devon to give the company bailout money (which he had previously refused), effectively making Devon Jack's boss.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{economic}} {{level of the}} People's Republic of China progressed rapidly during the 1990s, the Canadian government concluded several economic and partnership deals with the country. However, when the Conservative government took power in 2006, {{relations between the two}} had changed most notably due on the question of human rights in the People's Republic of China in which the Conservative government had criticized its records. Meanwhile, President Hu Jintao criticized Canada for making the Dalai-Lama an honorary citizen and to make several meetings with him. The monk made his latest visit in October 2007 where he met with Harper, the first time a Canadian Prime Minister meet with the spiritual leader. Secretary of State and MP Jason Kenney denied that <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>will</b> cause harm to trade {{relations between the two countries}} despite threats from the Chinese governments due to the meeting in which the Chinese Foreign Ministry called it [...] "gross interference in China's affairs". In addition, Hu also criticized the government about its accusations over China's human rights record and denied any kind of abuse of it in his country.|$|E

2500|$|... 21 March – The Permanent Council of the OAS stated its {{session to}} discuss the topic “Current {{situation}} and dialogue in Venezuela”. Before beginning the intervention of María Corina, the Member States’ representatives discuss if <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>will</b> be public of private after Nicaragua’s delegate to the OAS, Ricardo Seintenfus, asked the meeting to be closed, followed by Venezuela’s ambassador, Roy Chaderton, who asked voting for this initiative. With 22 votes in favor, 11 against and an abstention from Barbados, the Member States decided the meeting to be closed. The countries that voted for an open process to the press were Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and United States. María Corina qualified the decision as “censorship”. A group of Venezuelans protested {{in front of the}} seat of the OAS in Washington demanding transparency after the decision was taken. Henrique Capriles rejected the negative of the OAS to allow María Corina to discuss about the problems in Venezuela. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a statement qualifying the decision as an “international victory against the coup”. Adán Chávez, older brother of Hugo Chávez, has joined the government's effort of criticizing opposition mayors who have supported the protest actions, stating that they [...] "could end up like Scarano and Ceballos" [...] by being charged for various cases.|$|E
2500|$|Unprogrammed worship (also {{known as}} waiting worship, [...] "silent worship", or holy communion {{in the manner}} of Friends) is based on the {{practices}} of George Fox and the Early Friends, who based their religious beliefs and practices on their interpretation of how the early Christians worshipped God their Heavenly Father. Friends gather together in [...] "expectant waiting upon God" [...] to experience his still small voice leading them from within. There is no plan on how <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>will</b> proceed, and actual practice varies widely between Meetings and individual worship services. Friends believe that God plans what will happen, with his spirit leading people to speak. When a participant feels led to speak, he or she will stand and share a spoken message of ("vocal ministry") in front of others. When this happens, Quakers believe that the spirit of God is speaking through the speaker. After someone has spoken, it is customary to allow a few minutes pass in silence for reflection on what has been said, before further vocal ministry is given. Sometimes a meeting is entirely silent, sometimes many speak. These meetings lasted for several hours in George Fox's day. Modern meetings are often limited to an hour, ending when two people (usually the elders) exchange the sign of peace by handshake. This handshake is often shared by the others. This style of worship is the norm in Great Britain, Ireland, the continent of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Southern Africa, Canada, and parts of the United States (particularly yearly meetings associated with Friends General Conference and Beanite Quakerism)—constituting about 11% of Quakers. Those who worship in this style hold each person to be equal before God and capable of knowing the light of God directly. Anyone present may speak if they feel led to do so. Traditionally, Recorded Ministers were recognised for their particular gift in vocal ministry. This religious practice continues among Conservative Friends and Liberal Friends (e.g. New York Yearly Meeting). Many meetings where Liberal Friends predominate abolished this religious practice. London Yearly Meeting of Friends abolished the acknowledging and recording of Recorded Ministers in 1924.|$|E

6000|$|Things {{were now}} at a deadlock; and Becker {{astonished}} every one by agreeing to a meeting on the 14th. It seems he knew what to expect. Writing on the 13th at least, he prophesies that <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>will</b> be held in vain, that the municipality must lapse, {{and the government of}} Tamasese step in. On the 14th, Sewall left his consulate in time, and walked some part of the way to the place of meeting in company with Wilson, the English pro-consul. But he had forgotten a paper, and in an evil hour returned for it alone. Wilson arrived without him, and Becker broke up the meeting for want of a quorum. There was some unedifying disputation as to whether he had waited ten or twenty minutes, whether he had been officially or unofficially informed by Wilson that Sewall was on the way, whether the statement had been made to himself or to Weber {1} in answer to a question, and whether he had heard Wilson's answer or only Weber's question: all otiose; if he heard the question, he was bound to have waited for the answer; if he heard it not, he should have put it himself; and it was the manifest truth that he rejoiced in his occasion. [...] "Sir," [...] he wrote to Sewall, [...] "I have the honour to inform you that, to my regret, I am obliged to consider the municipal government to be provisionally in abeyance since you have withdrawn your consent to the continuation of Mr. Martin in his position as magistrate, and since you have refused {{to take part in the}} meeting of the municipal board agreed to for the purpose of electing a magistrate. The government of the town and district of the municipality rests, as long as the municipality is in abeyance, with the Samoan government. The Samoan government has taken over the administration, and has applied to the commander of the imperial German squadron for assistance in the preservation of good order." [...] This letter was not delivered until 4 P.M. By three, sailors had been landed. Already German colours flew over Tamasese's headquarters at Mulinuu, and German guards had occupied the hospital, the German consulate, and the municipal gaol and court-house, where they stood to arms under the flag of Tamasese. The same day Sewall wrote to protest. Receiving no reply, he issued on the morrow a proclamation bidding all Americans look to himself alone. On the 26th, he wrote again to Becker, and on the 27th received this genial reply: [...] "Sir, your high favour of the 26th of this month, I give myself the honour of acknowledging. At the same time I acknowledge the receipt of your high favour of the 14th October in reply to my communication of the same date, which contained the information of the suspension of the arrangements for the municipal government." [...] There the correspondence ceased. And on the 18th January came the last step of this irritating intrigue when Tamasese appointed a judge--and the judge proved to be Martin.|$|E
