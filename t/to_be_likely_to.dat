5|$|In 1803, {{war with}} France {{appeared}} imminent once again. After some discussions, {{it was agreed}} to adapt the 16th-century keep to enable it to hold six 24-pounder (10.8kg) guns; the roof was vaulted and a central stone pillar was installed to run up through the building, work estimated at the time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> cost £4,122. The historian Andrew Saunders likens the resulting building to the various Martello towers being constructed along the south coast at this time. It was proposed to build two temporary gun batteries to replace the 1795 emplacements, which had suffered from the salt air and decayed, but the plan was turned down in order {{to focus attention on}} the redevelopment of the keep. The work was carried out by a mixture of soldiers and civilian contractors and was completed by the end of 1806.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of Titanics wreck, in addition to the common assumption that she had sunk in one piece, it had been widely believed that conditions at 12,000 feet down would preserve the ship virtually intact. The water is bitterly cold at only about , there is no light and the high pressure was thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> lower oxygen and salinity levels to the point that organisms {{would not be able to}} gain a foothold on the wreck. Titanic would effectively be in a deep freeze. The reality has turned out to be very different, and the ship has increasingly deteriorated since she sank in April 1912. Her gradual decay is due to a number of different processes– physical, chemical and biological. She is situated on an undulating, gently sloping area of seabed in Titanic Canyon which is swept by the Western Boundary Current. Eddies from the current flow constantly across the wreck, scouring the sea bed and keeping sediment from building up over the hull. The current is strong and often changeable, gradually opening up holes in the ship's hull. Salt corrosion eats away at the hull and it is also affected by galvanic corrosion.|$|E

25|$|Supporters of Benelli were {{confident}} {{that he would be}} elected, and in early ballots, Benelli came within nine votes of success. However, both men faced sufficient opposition for neither <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> prevail. Giovanni Colombo, the Archbishop of Milan was considered as a compromise candidate among the Italian cardinal-electors, but when he started to receive votes, he announced that, if elected, he would decline to accept the papacy. Franz Cardinal König, Archbishop of Vienna, suggested to his fellow electors another compromise candidate: the Polish Cardinal Karol Józef Wojtyła. Wojtyła won on the eighth ballot on the third day (16 October) with, according to the Italian press, 99 votes from the 111 participating electors.|$|E
25|$|According to the Torah, {{the tribe}} {{consisted}} of descendants of Gad the seventh son of Jacob, from whom it took its name. However, some Biblical scholars view this {{also as a}} postdiction, an eponymous metaphor providing an aetiology of the connectedness of the tribe {{to others in the}} Israelite confederation. In the Biblical account, Gad is one of the two descendants of Zilpah, a handmaid of Jacob, the other descendant being Asher; scholars see this as indicating that the authors saw Gad and Asher as being not of entirely Israelite origin (hence descendants of handmaids rather than of full wives). In common with Asher is the possibility that the tribal name derives from a deity worshipped by the tribe, Gad being thought by scholars <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have taken its name from Gad, the semitic god of fortune; the name of Gad does not appear in the Song of Deborah, which scholars regard as one of the oldest parts of the Bible, pre-dating most of the Torah.|$|E
25|$|Males {{can remain}} in a {{reproductive}} unit for four to five years. While geladas have traditionally been considered to have a male-transfer society, many males appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> return and breed in their natal bands. Nevertheless, gelada males leave their natal units and try {{to take over a}} unit of their own. A male can take over a reproductive unit either through direct aggression and fighting or by joining one as a subordinate and taking some females with him to create a new unit. When more than one male is in a unit, only one of them can mate with the females. The females in the group together can have power over the dominant male. When a new male tries to take over a unit and overthrow the resident male, the females can choose to support or oppose him. The male maintains his relationship with the females by grooming them rather than forcing his dominance, in contrast to the society of the hamadryas baboon. Females accept a male into the unit by presenting themselves to him. Not all the females may interact with the male. Usually, one may serve as his main partner. The male may sometimes be monopolized by this female. The male may try to interact with the other females, but they are usually unresponsive.|$|E

500|$|The castle was garrisoned from 1553 onwards by between 26 and 27 men, {{including}} 17 gunners; {{they were}} led by a captain, Thomas Wilford having taken over this role by 1570.

War broke out the next year, and in 1588, the year of the Spanish Armada, a Jesuit priest called Father Darbysher, and Roger Walton, a spy in the pay of the Spanish, made plans to hand over the castle to an invading force of French and Spanish soldiers, although the conspiracy never came to fruition.|$|E

Studies 4 and 5 revealed that participants’ chronic prevention focus predicted a low sense of control (Study 4), and that promotion focus predicted a high sense of control (Studies 4 and 5).

40|$|The {{phenomenology}} of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) {{occurring in}} hypnagogic and hypnopompic (H&H) states has received little attention.
