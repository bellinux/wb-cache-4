5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God.

Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even <b>those</b> <b>who</b> will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E
