The invention was a <b>tempering</b> <b>machine</b> for anti-aircraft guns and it was introduced for military anti-aircraft instrumentation. Among other things, he collaborated with AB Bofors about his invention Impulse engine, a <b>tempering</b> <b>machine</b> for anti-aircraft autocannons. The Bofors 40 mm air-craft gun, often referred to simply as the Bofors gun, is an anti-aircraft/multi-purpose autocannon designed in the 1930s by the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors. It {{was one of the most}} popular medium-weight anti-aircraft systems during World War II. In the mid-1930s the foundation for the company’s most famous product was laid, the Bofors 40mm automatic cannon, which during World War II were produced in different countries in 10,000 numbers of copies.|$|E
50|$|The last {{stage is}} tempering, {{which refers to}} the precise raising, lowering, and raising of the {{temperature}} of liquid chocolate. The <b>tempering</b> <b>machine</b> heats and cools the chocolate to create a specific crystal structure, ensuring that the chocolate has a higher melting point. The tempered chocolate is pumped into depositors which doses it into moulds. These are then placed onto a vibratory table to evenly distribute the chocolate, remove air bubbles, and be conveyed to a cooling room to solidify.|$|E
40|$|Crystallization is a {{critical}} step of the entire process and for quality in chocolate production. Problems may arise from the different nucleation tendencies of cocoa butters, their polymorphism and {{from the lack of}} knowledge about appropriate process parameters. The cooling time needed for the nucleation within the chocolate mass depends on the mechanical effects of the tempering unit and on the nucleation tendency of the formulation. Thermoanalytical measurements (DSC) may help to calculate crystallization behaviour and to find the optimal cooking conditions. High shearing of the <b>tempering</b> <b>machine</b> accelerates the crystallization process and forces the development of the desired high-melting modifications of fat-crystals...|$|E
25|$|Chocolate <b>tempering</b> <b>machines</b> (or temperers) with {{computer}} controls {{can be used}} for producing consistently tempered chocolate. In particular continuous <b>tempering</b> <b>machines</b> are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by Aasted, Sollich and Buhler, three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment, with a focus now on energy efficiency. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40–50°C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26–30°C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear, then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper firstly {{analyzes}} {{the problems that}} exist in the cold rolling of steel industry. Secondly, a new approach is proposed to temper and straighten the strip steel based on the temper leveling mill, shortly, TLM. The required high quality of the wave, surface and mechanical properties can be achieved only with TLM. TLM holds the functions of both <b>temper</b> <b>machine</b> and straightening mill and can produce good quality strip steel, no only the waviness, mechanical properties, but also the surface quality. The usage of TLM can lower the cost of the production of tempering, straightening and equipment investment. Finally, the experiments are done and verify the validity of the approach...|$|R
2500|$|Nitriding heats {{the steel}} part to [...] in an {{atmosphere}} of ammonia gas and dissociated ammonia. The time the part spends in this environment dictates the depth of the case. The hardness is achieved by the formation of nitrides. Nitride forming elements must be present for this method to work; these elements include chromium, molybdenum, and aluminium. The advantage of this process is that it causes little distortion, so the part can be case-hardened after being quenched, <b>tempered</b> and <b>machined.</b>|$|R
40|$|The hard {{turning and}} {{grinding}} of High Speed Steel (HSS) materials with hardness of 61 HRC significantly changes structural properties. Estimators of the cutting conditions are surface roughness, dimensions, tolerances and required {{structure of the}} surface layer. Vacuum heat treatment of HSS for cold working applications was used as yielded material with greater toughness, while the hardness was maintained constant or even increased. HSS-BRM 2 material that was vacuum quenched and <b>tempered</b> was <b>machined.</b> After the machining {{with that kind of}} tool property, the surface layer of the workpiece can be completely damage-free. Practical implications assume that a hard turning is a semi finishing or finishing process relevance. Surface roughness is a consequence of both cutting instability and of tool/workpiece loading condition. Originality of this paper is in an analysis of sources and prevention of workpiece material structure damage while reaching high machined surface quality and workpiece geometrical tolerances...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study aims at {{presenting}} a method formodelling machining processes considering MinimumQuantityLubrication (MQL) in a 2 D and 3 DFEMsimulation by using the example of <b>machining</b> <b>tempered</b> steel AISI 4140. All parameters required for the FEMsimulation are calculatedwithin the multiphase simulation code INSFLA and the formula for the heat conduction coefficient is derived. To consider the influence of phasetransformations of the fluid, separate experiments are performed. Furthermore, the frictioncoefficient is measured experimentally in dependence of the relative sliding velocity, contact pressureand temperature during machining with MQL as well as under dry conditions. The extended friction modelis used for the 2 D and 3 D models. MQLmachining experiments areperformed for the purpose of validating these models. The main focus of the experiments is layed on cutting temperatures, forces and phasetransformations on single workpieces...|$|R
50|$|Tempering: Tempering {{chocolate}} is a heat treatment method performed on chocolate involving {{heating and cooling}} the chocolate to result in desired characteristics like shininess of the chocolate or 'snap', the way it breaks. A chocolatier must know how to temper chocolate properly for different applications or temper for chocolate for desired characteristics. Chocolate contains cocoa butter which crystallizes during the heat treatment of melting and tempering chocolate. The crystal formation in chocolate can affect many different attributes to the chocolate - mouthfeel, snap of the chocolate, the color, dull or shiny. Heating the chocolate at certain temperatures, around 86-90 °F (30-32 °C), for specific periods of time and then cooling the chocolate and working with, in alternating segments {{is referred to as}} <b>tempering.</b> There are <b>machines</b> that can <b>temper</b> chocolate for you, but many chocolatiers use marble slabs and hand-tools to cool the chocolate and work with it.|$|R
5000|$|Bernard Woolley visits Sir Humphrey, {{who wants}} to know his {{feelings}} on Professor Marriott's proposal. Initially, Bernard is all in favour, but his superior soon provides a counter-argument. He maintains that once you start taking power away from the right people (i.e. civil servants like themselves) it can only go to the wrong people (politicians). Furthermore, they will want more of it, eventually leading to regional government. This would be very damaging to the civil service, as the [...] "months of fruitful work" [...] that its officials currently undertake to arrive at [...] "a mature and responsible conclusion" [...] would be reduced to a decision taken {{over the course of a}} couple of meetings by [...] "complete amateurs". Bernard remarks that such persons have every right to power in a democracy, but the Cabinet Secretary points out that this is a British democracy, which apparently makes all the difference. In other words, there is a system: [...] "a civilised, aristocratic government <b>machine,</b> <b>tempered</b> by occasional general elections." ...|$|R
