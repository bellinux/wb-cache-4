2500|$|Boam, who {{was raised}} Catholic, used many {{religious}} themes and metaphors in his script for the film. In preparing the story, he studied grail literature, but ultimately invented new mythology. He made the grail a symbol for faith. He said, [...] "I guess the major given of faith is that it can't be proved otherwise you don't need faith. So that is why I created {{the idea that the}} grail can't be removed (from its hiding place). You can find the grail, but you can't really prove <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> it." [...] When Indiana Jones finally discovers the grail hidden among decoys, its knight guardian tells him that he will die if he drinks from the wrong cup. Boam said that this scene is a metaphor for [...] "the one true God vs. false gods". He worried that the film's religious themes would face criticism from the general audience, as well as religious scholars. He was relieved when the criticism didn't appear, saying, [...] "Nobody working on this movie was a religious scholar... I was wondering if the numerous allusions to Christ in Indiana Jones were going to put people off. I was afraid the kids in the audience would think it was not a very hip subject matter." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But I {{want to do}} my share; it {{was through}} me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> out where they were, and it isn't fair to make me stay behind?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have <b>found</b> your sister, {{permit me}} to {{introduce}} you to my wife," [...] he said to Gabriel, taking Grace's hand in his own.|$|R
6000|$|... “Are {{there any}} lions?” asked Eric hopefully. He {{had been reading}} Roman history and thought <b>that</b> where <b>you</b> <b>found</b> Christians <b>you</b> might {{reasonably}} expect to find a few lions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have <b>found</b> {{out your}} own feelings?" [...] Staveley said at last; and {{his tone was}} then serious enough even for his friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to tell me that no one brought them here; <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> them in that drawer? That, so to speak, no one at all brought them back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{willing to}} take your word for it <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> signs of oil; but I would rather hear what some one else thought as {{to the size of}} the well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It matters not," [...] said Brant coldly. [...] "You {{have used}} this house and those within it to forward your designs. It is not your fault <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> nothing in the dispatch-box you opened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have <b>found</b> your proper sphere," [...] Brooks answered, smiling. [...] "I can't think why {{you ever}} needed me to suggest it to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It matters not," [...] said he, [...] "for {{it happens}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have <b>found</b> us almost on the wing, Westly. I knew {{full well that}} this fellow Buxley--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes!" [...] said Giannozzo Pucci, [...] "lead {{the last}} chorus from Poliziano's `Orfeo,' <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have <b>found</b> such an {{excellent}} measure for, {{and we will}} all fall in:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} to see you, Mr. Peck," [...] said Annie; [...] "I've {{wanted to tell you}} how pleased I am <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> shelter in my old home when you first came to Hatboro'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Ef the {{earthquake}} kin heave up that silver-bearing rock that {{you told us}} about the first day you kem here, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> t'other day, it could play roots with a mere mill-stream, I reckon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{remember}} that you told me quite recently <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> you had 1,500 pounds to your credit, therefore I felt quite sure {{that you would not}} grudge 1,000 pounds of it to enable me to fulfil this duty--this semi-divine duty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{only one}} mystery left. How was it, when you and Mr. Ryan escaped from Bayonne, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are <b>found</b> in a boat in the Bay of Saint Malo?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{surprise}} {{was not all}} on one side, I assure you. I had no idea <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had <b>found</b> my occasional retreat, still less <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were inside it, until I was within twenty paces of the door." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! {{you mean}} about Fido,' said Mrs. Hazleby, almost smiling; 'yes, Lucy told me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had <b>found</b> him. Really, my girls are so careless, I can trust nothing to them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had hoped, madame," [...] she said, {{the color}} {{coming and going}} on cheeks that were now usually pale--"I had hoped, madame, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> my work profitable. Surely, surely I bring home as much at night as any other {{demoiselle}} you employ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{a sudden}} inspiration. I had to do {{something}} to make you think well of me, and I thought it might meet the case if I saved you from a lunatic with a pistol. It wasn't my fault <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you can't shake me off now, can you, Lady Caroom?" [...] he declared, {{appealing}} to her. [...] "We'll consider it an accident <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> me here, if you like, {{but it is}} in reality a great piece of good fortune for you." ...|$|E
60|$|Aha! my {{good little}} dog! I {{thought you would}} stand to <b>that</b> game when <b>you</b> <b>found</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can, {{and those}} of many more. It seems <b>that</b> <b>you</b> thought <b>you</b> <b>found</b> in <b>that</b> school a wider creed than the one to which you had been accustomed?" ...|$|R
60|$|And I wish I {{was quite}} sure <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have all <b>found</b> these wanderings pleasant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm glad to {{hear you}} say so," [...] said Sir Henry, glancing with some {{surprise}} at my friend. [...] "I don't pretend to know much about these things, and I'd be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture. I didn't know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> time for such things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, but ye're wilcome, Mister Piddler, or Mister Birch, or Mister Beelzeboob, or what's yeer name. Ye're {{an honest}} divil anyway, and I'm hoping <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> the pitticoats convanient. Come forward, dear, and fale the fire; Sergeant Hollister won't be hurting you, for {{the fear of}} an ill turn you may be doing him hereafter--will ye, sargeant dear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Treachery!" [...] exclaimed the old man. [...] "We were no {{more than}} that this morning. It is indeed {{fortunate}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> us. I take it you are from Fort Henry, and will guide us there? I am an old friend of Colonel Zane's. He will appreciate any kindness you may show us. Of course you know him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> couldn't. <b>You</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> for {{all sorts}} of things it was a {{question}} of where to buy and how to buy, and what you didn't know how to buy with your money, straight away this world planted something else upon you----" ...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a twinkle}} {{in the eyes of}} Paddy the Beaver as he replied: [...] "Well, now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't do <b>that,</b> because I am bigger than you and can stop you, {{what are you going to}} do about it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yourself, Prince. Surely <b>you</b> {{can guess}} <b>that</b> your absence has been noted. We feared lest harm {{should have come}} to <b>you,</b> or <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had lost your path, but it seems <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have <b>found</b> a guide," [...] and he stared at his {{companion}} sternly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Almighty!" [...] he said, [...] "I {{remember}} now. It {{was here}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> me, Suzanne, after I was shipwrecked, and the tigers stared at {{us through the}} boughs of that fallen tree," [...] and he shivered a little, for {{the sight of the}} spot brought back to his heart some of the old terrors which had haunted his childhood.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody sez ye are, but you'd be wuss--a fool--ef you didn't take him. I'm {{testimony}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> him {{among your}} hosses; I'll tell Judge Boompointer you've got him, and ye kin {{send him back}} when you're safe. The judge will be mighty glad to get him back, and call it quits. So ef you've writ to Salomy Jane, come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us put my own {{feelings}} {{out of the}} question," [...] she said. [...] "There is a reason for my not going away, unless I first have the assurance of seeing you again. You have a claim--the strongest claim of any one--to know how I came here, unknown to my friends, {{and how it was}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> me fallen so low." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, I didn't mean that. I meant <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> <b>found</b> {{the woman}} less inconceivable and more human, don't write to me, but put your red lamp in your window {{instead of the}} blue one. I will watch for it and see it." ...|$|R
