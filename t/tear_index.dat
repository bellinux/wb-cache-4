In 40 -year-old trees the tear strength of pulps from 30 th internode material (that which contains 30 growth rings) was almost {{twice that of}} 10 th internode material. Similarly in 18 -year-old thinnings, the 15 th internode pulps had higher <b>tear</b> <b>index</b> than the pulps from 10 th or 5 th internodes. Pulps from all types of material were readily beaten to good burst and tensile strength, the ease of beating decreasing with increase in wood age. In studies of 5 -ring-group material numbered from the pith {{it was found that}} the outer wood pulps from mature trees had tear strength 3 times that of pulp from growth rings 1 - 5; the inner wood pulps formed sheets of higher density than pulps from outer wood, since the fibres were more readily collapsed. As expected, slabwood pulps gave pulps with highest tear strength. The data on slabwood and those for internodal and ring-group pulps indicate that the strength parameter most affected by wood age is <b>tear</b> <b>index.</b> As tree age increases tear strength of pulps also increases.

The observed differences were explained {{and supported by}} structural analyses, by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} the enzymatic deinking of various types of waste paper. Studies on the optimization of enzymatic deinking have been performed previously using commercially available enzyme preparations containing cellulase and hemicellulase. The enzymatic deinking of different types of waste paper demonstrated a high efficiency of 86. 6 % on laser-printed paper, but a low deinking efficiency of 12. 9 % was obtained with newspaper. All enzymatic treatments significantly improved the drainage rate of the deinked waste paper. Enzymatic deinking increased the tensile index of magazine paper but reduced the tensile index of bubble jet-printed paper, photocopy paper and newspaper. Enzymatic hydrolysis caused a 21. 1 % reduction in the <b>tear</b> <b>index</b> for bubble jet-printed paper, but a 3. 1 % increase in the <b>tear</b> <b>index</b> was obtained for laser-printed paper relative to respective blank. In addition, enzymatic hydrolysis increased the burst index by 4. 7 % relative to blank for laser-printed paper. However, photocopy paper showed the highest reduction (8. 3 %) in the burst index relative to blank. Taken together, these results suggest that enzymatic hydrolysis is both advantageous and detrimental to the mechanical properties of deinked paper. Thus, the proper regulation of enzymatic hydrolysis is crucial to improve the quality of recycled paper...|$|E

Methods: Thirty-two consecutive eyes from 23 patients having progressive keratoconus were enrolled in this prospective, interventional cohort study. The standard crosslinking surgery was performed for all patients. Visual, refractive, and topographic evaluations were done before and at 6 months after surgery. Tear function tests and confocal microscopic examination were performed before and at 1 month and 6 months after the procedure. Results: There was no significant change in Schirmer- 1 test results and tear osmolarity at 1 month and 6 months after CXL. Using confocal microscopy, all eyes showed reduced or absent subepithelial nerve plexus. Differences in basal epithelial cell density, epithelial mean cell area, and keratocyte density in anterior and middle stroma and endothelial cell pleomorphism were all significant at 1 month and 6 months after CXL (P < 0. 05).

The results showed that pretreated with endo-cellulase at the dosage of 0. 4 ECG/g before refining could increase the refining degree by 53. 09 %, and it would reduce refining energy consumption significantly. At this dosage, the tensile index of the paper sheet increased while the <b>tear</b> <b>index</b> of paper sheet decreased slightly. Additionally, enzymatic pretreatment could raise fiber surface wettability, lower the absolute value of Zeta potential and decrease the crystallinity of fiber, which was help to improve refining performance...|$|E
40|$|Calcium {{hydroxide}} filler dispersions, {{of various}} particle sizes, were prepared by mixing sodium hydroxide with calcium chloride, in various concentrations, at room temperature. The resulting filler dispersions were added, in various amounts, to the banana stem mechanical pulp, {{which was then}} converted to handsheets. Increasing the filler loading increased the tensile index but reduced the <b>tear</b> <b>index</b> and water absorption of the handsheets. The SEM micrographs of the handsheets surfaces and the tensile fractured surfaces of the handsheets tensile test specimens showed that increasing the filler loading resulted {{in the formation of}} more and bigger filler aggregates in the spaces between the fibre. The filler particle size did not have any significant effect on the handsheets properties...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{microwave}} drying on the mechanical and optical properties of handsheets made from kraft and chemi-thermomechanical pulps were studied experimentally. The quality of paper dried {{in a microwave}} field of 2450 MHz is {{compared with that of}} paper dried by conventional method under standard conditions. Key physical properties measured include burst index, density, <b>tear</b> <b>index,</b> breaking length, zero-span tensile strength, double fold, STFI compressibility and optical properties include brightness, opacity and scattering coefficient. All properties were found to be either enhanced or at the same level as those obtained under standard conditions. Furthermore, it is suggested that {{microwave drying}} could replace the conventional drying method in the standard testing of pulp and paper samples for quality control purposes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Inverse {{emulsion}} {{graft copolymerization}} of chitosan and acrylamide monomer under microwave radiation was studied. It was shown {{that when the}} microwave radiation power was 300 W, the microwave radiation time was 150 S, the volume ratio of oil phase and water phase was 1 : 1, the weight ratio of chitosan and AM was 1 : 7, the initiator concentration was 0. 67 mmol/L, the dosage of emulsification agent was 7 % {{of the weight of}} oil phase and the weight ratio of Span- 80 and OP- 10 was 6 : 4, stable inverse latex could be gained. A good dry strengthening effect had been obtained by applying the above mentioned latex in wheat straw pulp as the strengthening agent. The breaking length and <b>tearing</b> <b>index</b> of paper was respectively increased by 23. 5 % and 15. 1 % when the dosage of the graft copolymer latex was 0. 6 %...|$|R
40|$|Alkaline Peroxide Mechanical Pulp (APMP) of {{triploid}} of Populus tomentosa {{was modified}} by laccase and a Laccase-Mediator-System (LMS). The {{influence of the}} following main variables on the pulp physical properties were studied: enzyme dosage, reaction time, treatment temperature, and pH. Under the optimum conditions of laccase treatment – pH 5, temperature 50 °C, pulp consistency 4 %, and a reaction time of 60 min – the optimum charge of laccase was 2 u/g. It was {{also found that the}} tensile strength and <b>tear</b> <b>indices</b> of the pulps treated with laccase increased significantly. The two-stage method of enzyme-mild acidic hydrolysis was adopted to isolate lignin from the APMP pulps both before and after enzymatic treatments. The functional groups in all lignin samples were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed with 31 P-NMR spectra. The molecular weight distributions of all the lignin samples were obtained through Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) after the lignin samples were benzoylated...|$|R
40|$|The pulp {{yield of}} orange tree wood was tested under various {{conditions}} including processing with soda-anthraquinone (soda-AQ), kraft-anthraquinone (kraft-AQ), or ethanol under different temperature, time, reagent concentration, and PFI laboratory beater beating regimes. Beating grade and stretch properties were studied, {{with a view to}} identifying the optimum operating conditions. Polynomial equations were derived that generally reproduced the dependent variables, with errors in most cases much less than 20 %. Kraft-AQ pulping was the most efficient. The values of the tensile, burst, and <b>tear</b> <b>indices</b> obtained with kraft-AQ (78. 04 Nm/g, 4. 84 kN/g, and 2. 97 mNm 2 /g, respectively), were in most cases higher than those found for soda-AQ and ethanol pulps. Using lower values of operational conditions than those required to maximize the studied paper properties (170 °C, 65 min, 13 % active alkali, and 2700 number of PFI beating revolutions), it was possible to provide a more energy- and chemically-efficient process for industrial facilities...|$|R
