Amnesty's Piers Bannister informed press that [...] "We {{do know that}} there's {{a high level of}} homophobia in Jamaica, so there was a possibility that it was a hate crime. Many hate crime victims are robbed afterward. We're not saying it wasn't a robbery; we just want a full investigation." [...] Schleifer publicly stated that it is [...] "really important to investigate [...] thoroughly. Because <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> strong indications that {{it might have been a}} homophobic attack".|$|E
500|$|Stoddart himself outspoken about Modernism, and its {{contemporary}} {{failures and}} historical misunderstandings, without hesitation, {{makes clear that}} his work stems from a Modernism born in neo-classicism, [...] "And yet, after having said all this about Modernism, I consider myself a Modernist – but {{in the context of}} a vast application of the term extending miles beyond the pokey wee official area to which usually it is confined. For in truth <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> two kinds of Modernism to be uncovered in the space of the last two and a half centuries, and it is to the first and largest of these that I belong and to which, in my small way, I contribute. This is the Modernism that was born in neo-classicism and has, as its great central titan, the mighty Richard Wagner." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the {{original}} release on AllMusic, Porcupine was described as a [...] "solid outing", a [...] "noticeably better listen than its predecessor, Heaven Up Here" [...] and [...] "well worth hearing". When reviewing the remastered 2003 version the review was expanded to add that new release was [...] "a very well done expansion of an already fine album". > Review | url = [...] | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate =16 May 2008 }} Blender magazine described the album in a review on their website as [...] "impossibly exciting pop-rock" [...] and Pitchfork called the album [...] "the band's definitive statement" [...] and described the track [...] "The Back of Love" [...] as [...] "the astonishing highlight of the group's career". CMJ critic Eric Chappe wrote that [...] "the constant emotional peaks and valleys of Porcupine may be perhaps too strong for some, but the musical peaks achieved in getting <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> something to behold." [...] The album appeared in the 1983 end of year critics' lists for both Melody Maker, where it was listed at number nine, and NME, where it was listed at number 32. The album is also listed in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E

2500|$|This {{division}} {{is correct in}} that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> three different works, but the designations [...] "Rabbah" [...] and [...] "Zuṭa" [...] are misleading, since the divisions so designated are not longer and shorter divisions of one work, but are, {{in spite of their}} relationship, independent of each other. The ancient authorities, who have different designations for this treatise, know nothing of the division into [...] "Rabbah" [...] and [...] "Zuṭa"; the Halakot Gedolot (ed. A. Hildesheimer, p.647) even includes {{a large part of the}} Derek Ereẓ Zuṭa under the title [...] "Rabbah." ...|$|E
2500|$|Landowners across Iowa have {{expressed}} concern about the implications of allowing the state to use eminent domain to condemn privately owned land, particularly agricultural land, on behalf of a company that has not demonstrated any substantial public benefit to the residents of Iowa. [...] In March 2015, a Des Moines Register poll found that while 57% of Iowans supported the Dakota Access Pipeline, 74% were opposed to the use of eminent domain condemnation on behalf of a private corporation. The Iowa chapter of the Sierra Club was [...] "worried about the rights of landowners [...] concerned about [...] Dakota Access LLCs economic projections and whether <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> any benefits to Iowa." ...|$|E

Run together, the photographs produced {{the effect of the}} horse in motion, or a film. Muybridge produced his prints onsite; when the press noticed the broken straps on Sallie's saddle in the prints, they became convinced of the prints' authenticity. Scientific American was among the publications that carried reports of Muybridge's groundbreaking 1878 work. While there have been rumors that Stanford had a large bet riding on the outcome of the study, the historian Phillip Prodger has said, [...] "I personally believe that the story of the bet is apocryphal. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> no primary accounts of this bet ever having taken place.

2500|$|The Hutchinsonian niche framework, on {{the other}} hand, {{directly}} precludes the possibility of there being vacant niches. Hutchinson defined the niche as an n-dimensional hyper-volume whose dimensions correspond to resource gradients over which species are distributed in a unimodal fashion. In this {{we see that the}} operational definition of his niche rests on the fact that a species is needed in order to rationally define a niche in the first place. This fact didn't stop Hutchinson from making statements inconsistent with this such as: “The question raised by cases like this is whether the three Nilghiri Corixinae fill all the available niches...or whether <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> empty niches.[...] [...]The rapid spread of introduced species often gives evidence of empty niches, but such rapid spread in many instances has taken place in disturbed areas.” Hutchinson (1957).|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of the [...] "ripple effect," [...] Rouse {{explains}} that, to {{a certain}} extent, it was dictated {{by a sense of}} narrative logic; [...] "it's really crucial that Carmen treats you differently depending on whether you killed her or not. It doesn't make sense that she'd still be loving toward you if you killed her in cold blood." [...] However, it was also important that the player never feel locked into one morality; they could begin the game with bad morality and finish with good morality; [...] "you can travel down different moral paths, and both the beginning you started with and the choices you make during Ties that Bind will affect your final outcome. So <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> a surprising number of possible stories to be told. I want every player to have their own unique version of Torque's story. I hope no two players will remember the game and the story exactly the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some philosophers' {{views are}} {{difficult}} to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, Ted Honderich holds the view that [...] "determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false" [...] and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or {{things that can be}} located in space and time, but are abstract entities. Further, even if they were micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> two notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The [...] "new" [...] problem is how to resolve this conflict.|$|E
