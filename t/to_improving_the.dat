5|$|A major {{stimulus}} <b>to</b> <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> {{accuracy and}} reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> economy, {{the lower}} social classes {{also had to}} {{be integrated into the}} new body politic, although they often got few rewards from independence. The political debate seeking answers to these questions was marked by a clash—at times on the battlefield—between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.|$|E

5|$|Within debates {{attempting}} {{to decipher the}} conclusion of Candide lies another primary Candide debate.

Critics argue that the group's reclusion on the farm signifies Candide and his companions' loss of hope {{for the rest of the}} human race. This view is to be compared to a reading that presents Voltaire as advocating a melioristic philosophy and a precept committing the travellers <b>to</b> <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> world through metaphorical gardening. This debate, and others, focuses on the question of whether or not Voltaire was prescribing passive retreat from society, or active industrious contribution to it.|$|E
5|$|A {{system of}} hiring stallions between districts existed in Scotland, with written records {{dating back to}} 1837. This program {{consisted}} of local agriculture improvement societies holding breed shows to choose the best stallion, whose owner was then awarded a monetary prize. The owner was then required, in return for additional monies, to take the stallion throughout a designated area, breeding to the local mares. Through this system and by purchase, Clydesdale stallions were sent throughout Scotland and into northern England. Through extensive crossbreeding with local mares, these stallions spread the Clydesdale type throughout the areas where they were placed, and by 1840, Scottish draught horses and the Clydesdale were one and the same. In 1877, the Clydesdale Horse Society of Scotland was formed, followed in 1879 by the American Clydesdale Association (later renamed the Clydesdale Breeders of the USA), which served both U.S. and Canadian breed enthusiasts. The first American stud book was published in 1882. In 1883, the short-lived Select Clydesdale Horse Society was founded {{to compete with the}} Clydesdale Horse Society. It was started by two breeders dedicated <b>to</b> <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> breed, who also were responsible in large part for the introduction of Shire blood into the Clydesdale.|$|E
5|$|As he had as {{governor}} of Kentucky, Ford gave attention <b>to</b> <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> efficiency of government. While serving on the Joint Committee on Printing during the One Hundred First and One Hundred Third Congresses, he saved the government {{millions of dollars in}} printing costs by printing in volume and using recycled paper. In 1998, Virginia senator John Warner sponsored the Wendell H. Ford Government Publications Reform Act of 1998; Ford signed on as a co-sponsor. The bill would have eliminated the Joint Committee on Printing, distributing its authority and functions among the Senate Rules Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the administrator of the Government Printing Office. It would also have centralized government printing services and penalized government agencies who did not make their documents available to the printing office to be printed. Opponents of the bill cited the broad powers granted to the printing office and concerns about the erosion of copyright protection. The bill was reported favorably out of committee, but was squeezed from the legislative calendar by issues related to the impending impeachment of Bill Clinton. Warner did not return to his chairmanship of the Joint Committee on Printing in the next congress, Ford retired from the Senate, and the bill was not re-introduced.|$|E

5|$|Mining in the creek's {{watershed}} {{began in}} 1844. A number of mining villages {{existed in the}} Tangascootack Creek watershed between 1845 and 1870. In the mid-1850s the Farrandsville Iron Company purchased large amounts of land in several places, including along Tangascootack Creek. In 1870 all of the mines in the area closed and lumbering became the area's most significant industry, with millions of board feet being floated downstream. The railroad tracks were removed and the mine buildings were abandoned or burned down. However, deep mining of the Clarion coal formation and the Lower Kittaning coal formation in the Tangascootack Creek watershed began in the 1800s and continued into the early 1900s. Strip mining operations began in the 1950s and 1960s, {{with some of the}} deep mines and surface mines being remined in the 1980s. The Independent Regulatory Review Commission issued a statement in the summer of 1987, saying that part of the North Fork Tangascootack Creek watershed was no longer suitable for surface mining. Treatment of the watershed began as early as 1998. Several projects devoted <b>to</b> <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> water quality of the creek had begun by 2001, by which point several more projects were planned. At least one of these projects involves the use of biosolids to encourage vegetation growth.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to manage the customer-waiting problem in Taiwanese fast food restaurants through reengineering of the APP ordering process. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses a literature review to identify different approaches of reengineering and use them <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> APP ordering process used in Taiwanese fast food restaurants. Findings: This research has identified six approaches of reengineering, which can be applied <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> APP ordering process in fast food restaurants. The application of thereengineering approaches, in the APP ordering process in Taiwanese fast food restaurants, generated four suggestions of how <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> original APP ordering process. Research limitations/implications: The subsequent research can apply other research methods <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> reliability and validity. Practical implications: The application of reengineering approaches <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> APP ordering process in fast food restaurants can be used in other country’s food industry and be adapted to other industries as well. The research could also provide a basis for companies that want to implement the APP ordering system.
