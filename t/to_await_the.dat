5|$|General Pigot was harshly criticise by Clinton {{for failing}} <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> relief force, {{which might have}} {{successfully}} entrapped the Americans on the island.

5|$|Just before 05:00, the battalion's survivors, just 75 {{men of the}} 150 who had set out, {{left the}} battery and headed for their {{secondary}} objective, the village of La Plein. The battalion, being too weak, only managed to liberate around half of the village, and had <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the 1st Commando Brigade {{later in the day}} to complete its capture.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, George Palaiologos sortied out of Dyrrhachium, {{but failed}} to save the situation. Alexios's ally, Serbian King Constantine Bodin stayed aside with his army, {{intending}} <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> outcome of the battle. When the Byzantines were defeated and started to flee, Bodin retreated with his army. The Turks who had been lent {{to him by the}} Seljuk Sultan Suleyman I followed Constantine's example.|$|E

60|$|Then ensued {{a desperate}} conflict. The Russians, taken wholly by surprise, {{appalled by the}} suddenness of the attack, and knowing the ferocity with which their assailants fought, in some cases offered but slight resistance, and leaped by scores from the windows at the back, preferring {{the risk of death}} or broken limbs <b>to</b> <b>awaiting</b> <b>the</b> rush of their enemies. Others defended {{themselves}} desperately, gathering {{on the top of the}} stairs, barring the doors, and resisting foot by foot until every man had been cut down.|$|R
5|$|The Convention adjourned from July 26 to August 6 <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> {{report of}} the Committee of Detail, which was to produce a first draft of the Constitution. It was chaired by John Rutledge, with the other members {{including}} Edmund Randolph, Oliver Ellsworth, James Wilson, and Nathaniel Gorham.|$|E
5|$|After his capture, the U.S. Army handed Hartmann, his pilots, {{and ground}} crew {{over to the}} Soviet Union on 14 May, where he was imprisoned in {{accordance}} with the Yalta Agreements, which stated that airmen and soldiers fighting Soviet forces had to surrender directly to them. Hartmann and his unit were led by the Americans to a large open-air compound <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> transfer. The number of prisoners grew to 50,000. Living conditions deteriorated, and some American guards {{turned a blind eye to}} escapes. In some cases they assisted by providing food and maps.|$|E
5|$|As {{dictated}} by the prescriptions Ubi periculum and Ne Romani, the conclave should have begun on 4 August, ten days {{after the death of}} Innocent VIII; however, the conclave was delayed <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> slow arrival of the aged Gherardo, bearing a letter from Venice's Council of Ten urging his acceptance into the College. The cardinals had decided as early as their first meeting on 24 July to use the Sistine Chapel for the balloting and assembly of the conclave.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Scutts {{took his}} friend by the hand, and after warmly urging {{him not to}} forget the expert {{instructions}} he had received concerning his back, slipped into the back room, and, a prey <b>to</b> forebodings, <b>awaited</b> <b>the</b> result.|$|R

5|$|Aware of {{the time}} constraints, Otway decided he could wait no longer, and the reduced {{battalion}} headed for the battery and joined up with Major Smith's reconnaissance party just outside the village of Gonneville en Auge. The reconnaissance party had cut a way through the barbed wire, and marked four routes through the minefield. Otway divided his men into four assault groups, and settled down <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the three gliders.|$|E
5|$|Candide and Cacambo {{eventually}} reach Suriname, {{where they}} split up: Cacambo travels to Buenos Aires to retrieve Lady Cunégonde, while Candide prepares {{to travel to}} Europe <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> two. Candide's remaining sheep are stolen, and Candide is fined heavily by a Dutch magistrate for petulance over the theft. Before leaving Suriname, Candide feels in need of companionship, so he interviews a number of local {{men who have been}} through various ill-fortunes and settles on a man named Martin.|$|E
5|$|Chas. H. Ross and Mr. Haybeck then {{testified to}} the {{articles}} he recovered from the Spray. The prosecutor, William H. Jelliffe, asked for another adjournment <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> arrival of Willis to testify to the collision. Voorhees opposed the adjournment and moved for Jackalow's immediate release {{on the ground that}} there was no jurisdiction because no crime had been proved to have been committed. Jeliffe replied that he intended to charge murder, piracy, and running away with a vessel with intent to steal it. Vroom granted an adjournment until Tuesday at 11am. Jackalow was remanded to the city prison.|$|E

5|$|György Borbély, Ban of Karánsebes, {{captured}} Lippa (now Lipova in Romania) {{and other}} Ottoman fortresses along the Maros River {{before the end}} of August. Koca Sinan Pasha broke into Wallachia, forcing Michael the Brave to retreat towards Transylvania. Michael routed the invaders in the Battle of Călugăreni, but he could not prevent them from seizing Târgoviște and Bucharest. He withdrew to Stoenești <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the Transylvanian and Moldavian troops.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{invasion}} was {{a delayed}} {{response to the}} defeat of the first Persian invasion of Greece, which had been ended by the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon. King Xerxes had amassed a huge army and navy, and set out to conquer all of Greece. The Athenian general Themistocles proposed that the Allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae and simultaneously block the Persian navy at the Straits of Artemisium. An Allied naval force of 271 triremes was thus dispatched <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the Persians.|$|E
5|$|Churches {{managed to}} {{convince}} {{the commander of the}} brigade to conduct an operation to free the rest of the work party the following day, by giving him crucial information regarding the work site and the guards. Next morning Churches and Laws returned with some hundred Partisans <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the work party by the usual train. As soon as work had begun the Partisans disarmed the eight guards and captured the four civilian overseers. In a short time the POWs, guards, and civilian overseers were being escorted south along a different route than that used by the first seven escapees the previous afternoon.|$|E
60|$|The Greeks {{determined}} {{to act on}} this advice. They broke up their encampment at the Olympic Straits, and, retreating to the southward, established themselves at Thermopylæ, <b>to</b> <b>await</b> there <b>the</b> coming of the conqueror. The people of Thessaly then surrendered to Xerxes {{as soon as they}} received his summons.|$|R

5|$|For an {{hour the}} frigates {{exchanged}} broadsides, until 01:15 when Hamelin, who had realised {{that he was}} fighting a warship not a troopship or East Indiaman, dropped back to effect repairs after suffering damage to his rigging. Ceylon was more severely damaged than the French ship and when Hamelin returned at 02:15, her repairs were not complete, preventing her escape. The battle began again, both frigates suffering serious damage in the second encounter. By 03:00, Vénus had lost her mizzenmast and two topmasts, while Ceylon had lost all of her topmasts, which had destroyed much of the ship's rigging as they fell. With both ships now unable to manoeuvre, the action continued at close range until 04:00, when Vénus was able to haul herself away <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> arrival of Victor.|$|E
5|$|Mallards usually form pairs (in October and November in the Northern Hemisphere) {{until the}} female lays eggs {{at the start}} of the nesting season, which is around the {{beginning}} of spring. At this time she is left by the male who joins up with other males <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> moulting period, which begins in June (in the Northern Hemisphere). During the brief time before this, however, the males are still sexually potent and some of them either remain on standby to sire replacement clutches (for female mallards that have lost or abandoned their previous clutch, replacement clutch) or forcibly mate with females that appear to be isolated or unattached regardless of their species and whether or not they have a brood of ducklings.|$|E
5|$|Most sources {{suggest that}} the Royal Agricultural Ground was often used as a home venue between 1908 and 1910, before the club hosted matches at the Sydney Sports Ground from 1911 onwards. It was here that the team played all of their home games up until 1986, when the ground was {{demolished}} with the Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2 {{to make way for}} Sydney's main rectangular field, the Sydney Football Stadium. In 1987, games were moved away to the Newtown Jets' home ground, Henson Park, temporarily <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> completion of the Sydney Football Stadium. The team capitalised on this move, finishing second in the regular season. It was the only time between 1983 and 1995 that the side reached the finals.|$|E

5|$|On Monday, April 4, U.S. Attorney Garret S. Cannon {{took over}} the {{prosecution}} and moved that Jackalow {{be transferred to the}} U.S. Marshall in the Essex County Jail. Voorhies again objected to jurisdiction, arguing that if the alleged murder was committed in the Long Island Sound it could only be tried in New York. Vroom on the other hand held that a showing of probable cause had been made. Further, he argued that he had jurisdiction {{on the grounds that the}} murder was committed between the state of New York and the Norwalk Islands, and Jackalow's robbery had in any case continued until his arrival in Barnegat. Jackalow was remanded to Newark <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> decision of the grand jury.|$|E

He is joined by Leila; resigned now to their deaths, the pair sing of how their souls will soon be united in heaven. A glow appears in the sky, and Zurga rushes in to report that the fishermen's camp is ablaze. As the men hurry away to save their homes, Zurga frees Leila and Nadir. He returns the necklace to Leila, and reveals {{that he is the}} man she saved when she was a child. He recognises now that his love for her is in vain, and tells her and Nadir to flee.

5|$|Since clones cannot {{properly}} die, the Sakura and Syaoran clones are reconstructed by Yūko, {{who wishes}} to compensate them for how their existences were used. She causes them to be reborn as humans, who eventually meet and start living together. Sakura gives birth to the original Syaoran and they realize {{they are in their}} own past. They raise him until it is time for him to begin the events of the series, then they seal themselves in a glass tube in order <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>the</b> time when Fei-Wang will attempt to shatter reality. After breaking free from the tube, Sakura and Syaoran reverse Fei-Wang's damage to the dimension using the magic they inherited from the sorcerer Clow Reed during their reincarnation. They disappear after Fei-Wang is killed by Kurogane, leaving behind only a feather which the original Sakura and Syaoran absorb.|$|E
