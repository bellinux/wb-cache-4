5|$|From a {{study of}} all the {{information}} available to the Board it is concluded that this flight crew was not capable of performing the function or assuming {{the responsibility for the}} job they presumed to do. The Board further concludes that the management personnel of Imperial Airlines should have been aware of <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which company operations were being accomplished. It is believed that the substandard maintenance practices of Imperial's employees were condoned by management. <b>The</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which maintenance and personnel records were kept by the company confirms this conclusion.|$|E
5|$|More {{than one}} {{waterspout}} {{can occur in}} the same vicinity at the same time. As many as nine simultaneous waterspouts have been reported on Lake Michigan. The illustration on the left, by James Pollard Espy in 1841, shows <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which one spout, while forming, tends to generate others in its neighborhood.|$|E

And the same thing happens, though the Surfaces of the Crystals be any ways inclined to one another, provided that their Planes of perpendicular Refraction be parallel to one another.|$|R

5|$|Another {{difference}} is <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which random battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, random battles {{occur on the}} world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map. Passing over one of these spots {{may result in a}} random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly how much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the engagements between 29 January and 1 February, the Coalition did not launch its main {{offensive}} into Kuwait and Iraq until the night of 24–25 February. The invasion of Iraq was completed about 48 hours later. The Battle of Khafji served as a modern example of the ability of air power to serve a supporting role to ground forces. It offered the Coalition an indication of <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which Operation Desert Storm would be fought, but also hinted at future friendly-fire casualties which accounted for nearly half of the American dead.|$|E

5|$|Fairman {{writes that}} legal {{precedent}} regarding {{use of the}} word is unclear because of contradictory court decisions. He presents case studies of these contradictory applications of the law, and uses them to analyze public perceptions surrounding freedom of speech. He provides examples of exceptions to the First Amendment, such as speech intended to cause violent acts, and discusses <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which federal and state governments sanction these exceptions. Fairman draws parallels between protection of comedians' usage of taboo language to the ability of individuals in society to express ideas freely. He argues that once citizens allow the government to restrict specific words {{that can be used in}} speech, this will lead to an encroachment upon freedom of thought.|$|E
5|$|Former McKinsey senior executives, Rajat Gupta and Anil Kumar, {{were among}} those convicted in a {{government}} investigation into insider trading for sharing inside information with Galleon Group hedge fund owner Raj Rajaratnam. Though McKinsey was not accused of any wrongdoing, the convictions were embarrassing for the firm, since it prides itself for integrity and client confidentiality. Following the initial allegations McKinsey no longer maintains a relationship with either senior partner, though <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which it severed ties attracted controversy.|$|E

However, Dean Lyons was able to provide accurate details of murders it is now accepted that he did not commit, due to <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which he was interviewed by gardaí. He wished to associate himself with the murders and readily agreed to leading questions which were asked by interviewing gardaí.|$|E

Texas issued a medical license to him in 1998. The year before Arafiles came to Winkler County, the TMB restricted his ability to supervise nurse practitioners and physician assistants for three years and fined him $1,000. In that case, the TMB expressed concerns about <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which he oversaw a physician assistant at a weight loss clinic and the way that he applied the clinic's patient care protocols.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed the Radiant A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were designed to make choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. <b>The</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to stealing from others, if they are given the opportunity {{and if it is}} in their character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E
5|$|Lochner {{probably}} saw van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece {{during his}} visit to the Netherlands and seems to have borrowed a number of its compositional elements. The similarities include <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which the figures engage with their space and the emphasis on and rendering of elements such as brocades, gems and metals. Some figures in Lochner's paintings are directly borrowed from Ghent, and a number of facial features match those seen in van Eyck. His Virgin with the Violet has often been compared to van Eyck's 1439 Virgin at the Fountain. Similarly to those in van Eyck's work, Lochner's angels often sing or play musical instruments, including lutes and organs.|$|E

5|$|Neither {{extension}} {{bill was}} debated. In February 1903, Parliament {{had established a}} Royal Commission on London Traffic to assess <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which transport in London should be developed. While the Commission deliberated, any review of bills for new lines and extensions was postponed. Both bills were later withdrawn by their promoters. The powers bills were approved as the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1903 on 21 July 1903 and the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (Various Powers) Act, 1903 on 11 August 1903.|$|E
5|$|On 30 July 1987, Wood {{was convicted}} on {{two counts of}} murder, one of {{attempted}} murder and one of theft, after a week-long trial. He had {{pleaded not guilty to}} the murder of Danielle, instead submitting a manslaughter plea claiming he killed her to complete a suicide pact. An appeal against the guilty verdict was filed a month later and rejected in 1989. The case impacted upon British firearms policy, especially <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which regional police forces communicate over firearm ownership.|$|E
5|$|Poetic diction treats <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which {{language}} is used, and refers {{not only to}} the sound but also to the underlying meaning and its interaction with sound and form. Many languages and poetic forms have very specific poetic dictions, to the point where distinct grammars and dialects are used specifically for poetry. Registers in poetry can range from strict employment of ordinary speech patterns, as favoured in much late-20th-century prosody, through to highly ornate uses of language, as in medieval and Renaissance poetry.|$|E
