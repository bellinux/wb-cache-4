50|$|The {{social role}} of the Plains Indian clowns was {{ceremonial}} since they performed primarily during rituals, dances and feasts. Unlike the clowns, the special role of <b>the</b> <b>Contraries</b> was not restricted to brief performances, rituals or the warpath. It was their everyday life. <b>The</b> <b>Contraries</b> of <b>the</b> Plains Indians were unique and historically unprecedented. John Plant examined the ethnological phenomena of contrary behavior, particularly in the tribes of the North American Plains Indians.|$|R

5|$|As {{biologists}} define macroevolution, both microevolution and macroevolution {{have been}} observed. Speciations, for example, have been directly observed many times, despite popular misconceptions to <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> Additionally, the modern evolutionary synthesis draws no distinction in the processes {{described by the}} theory of evolution when considering macroevolution and microevolution as the former is simply at the species level or above and the latter is below the species level. An example of this is ring species.|$|E
50|$|A Contrary was {{a member}} of a Native North American tribal group who adopted {{behavior}} that was deliberately the opposite of other tribal members. <b>The</b> <b>Contraries</b> were found among the historical Amerindian tribes of the Great Plains.

25|$|On {{the level}} of pre-systematic thought, the mystery of totality embodies man's {{endeavor}} to reach a perspective in which <b>the</b> <b>contraries</b> are abolished, <b>the</b> Spirit of Evil reveals itself as a stimulant of Good, and Demons appear as the night aspect of the Gods.|$|R
5000|$|Also, {{traditional}} man's {{dissatisfaction with}} the post-mythical age expresses itself as {{a feeling of being}} [...] "torn and separate". In many mythologies, the lost mythical age was a Paradise, [...] "a paradoxical state in which <b>the</b> <b>contraries</b> exist side by side without conflict, and the multiplications form aspects of a mysterious Unity". The coincidentia oppositorum expresses a wish to recover the lost unity of the mythical Paradise, for it presents a reconciliation of opposites and the unification of diversity:On the level of pre-systematic thought, the mystery of totality embodies man's endeavor to reach a perspective in which <b>the</b> <b>contraries</b> are abolished, <b>the</b> Spirit of Evil reveals itself as a stimulant of Good, and Demons appear as the night aspect of the Gods.|$|R

Although Route 571 and Route 526 are proposed to be realigned onto the new alignment, there is no designated change proposed for Route 64. On <b>the</b> <b>contrary</b> to this, one state figure shows Route 64 running along Washington Road, where the two county routes currently run.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a lack of {{substantial}} archaeological or literary evidence to support the defence-in-depth theory. J.C.

5|$|In June 2010, Anurag Basu {{confirmed}} that his film would feature three lead roles, a deaf and mute man, a mentally challenged girl, and a narrator.

5|$|It thus {{appears that}} prior to the cession the Mexican authorities, upon examination, found that the Indians had {{abandoned}} the land; that the only adverse claim was vested in the mission of San Diego and made an absolute grant, subject only to the condition of satisfying whatever claims the mission might have. How can it be said therefore that when the cession was made by Mexico to the United States there was a present recognition by the Mexican government of the occupancy of these Indians? On <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> so far as any official action is disclosed, it was distinctly to <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> and carried with it an affirmation that they had abandoned their occupancy, and that whatever of title there was outside of the Mexican nation was in the mission, and an absolute grant was made subject only {{to the rights of}} such mission.|$|E
