5|$|Washington's second inauguration {{took place}} in the Senate Chamber of Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the first at this site) on March 4, 1793. The presidential oath of office was {{administered}} by Supreme Court associate justice William Cushing. Washington's inaugural address was just 135 words, the shortest to date. This inauguration was brief and simple, a sharp contrast to the extravaganza four years earlier, which, in the eyes of many, had all <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> of a monarchical coronation.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the {{territory}} gained its first representative in the Parliament, although at first with limited speaking and voting rights. In 1974 it gained a fully elected, but still advisory House of Assembly. In 1988 it gained <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> of self-government with a Legislative Assembly {{with most of}} the powers and responsibilities of an Australian state, although subject to a federal right of veto, similar to the arrangements adopted for the Northern Territory in 1978. The Legislative Assembly legalised some things that were prohibited in other parts of Australia, such as prostitution and X-rated pornography; in 2006, an attempt to allow civil unions for same-sex couples was overruled by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Nicholson was {{at first}} seen as an {{improvement}} over the Catholic Thomas Dongan, the outgoing governor. However, the province's old guard was unhappy that Andros removed all of the provincial records to Boston, and then Nicholson alarmed the sometimes hardline Protestant population by preserving <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> of the chapel in Fort James that Dongan and the handful of New York's Catholics had used for worship. In response to a rumored Dutch invasion of England (a rumor {{that turned out to}} be true), Nicholson in January 1689 ordered the provincial militias to be on alert to protect the province for the king. Unknown to Nicholson, events in England had already changed things.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare {{different}} types and ages of restoration from the small mammal biodiversity perspective. In 2004, three linear and two quadratic trappings of small terrestrial mammals were performed at the Velká podkrušnohorská spoil heap. Linear trappings were repeated in 2009 and quadratic were repeated in 2010. In 2004, 174 small mammals in <b>the</b> linear <b>trappings</b> and 199 small mammals in <b>the</b> quadratic <b>trappings</b> were captured. We found, that the wetland localities were the richest in small mammal diversity, the forestry restored areas were second ones, and the agriculturally restored areas were the poorest ones. During <b>the</b> repeated <b>trappings,</b> 45 small mammals in linear trappings and 64 small mammals in quadratic trappings were captured. A decrease of both abundance and biodiversity was recorded in the both types of <b>trappings.</b> <b>The</b> highest biodiversity was on wetland and forestry restored areas. The lowest biodiversity was on agriculturally restored areas. The highest abundance was on forestry sites during <b>the</b> linear <b>trappings.</b> <b>The</b> wetland areas were second ones and the lowest abundance was on agriculturally restored areas. Value of abundance in quadratic <b>trappings</b> was almost <b>the</b> same in wetland and forest habitats, whilst the abundance of agricultural areas was significantly lower. The results show the importance of wetland habitats, which are very important part of restoration and have a positive impact on the overall biodiversity in the landscape...|$|R

5|$|Throughout Battleship Division Nine's {{time with}} the Grand Fleet, combating boredom was a {{constant}} difficulty. Located at the northeastern tip of Scotland, the islands surrounding Scapa Flow {{were little more than}} barren, cold, windswept specks of land devoid of <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> of civilization. Due to the efforts of the officers to keep their men entertained, however, morale remained high throughout the war. The British worked hard to turn the anchorage into a more inviting place. Central to these efforts were sporting events. The Fleet held numerous inter-ship competitions, including soccer, rugby, rowing, track, and boxing, which were followed with intense interest by the men of the respective ships.|$|E
5|$|Read {{retired from}} {{military}} life on 20 March 1975 and was succeeded by Air Marshal James Rowland, {{who later became}} Governor of New South Wales. Considered disdainful of bureaucracy and some of <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> of high office, Read refused to sit for the traditional portrait painted of former Chiefs of the Air Staff. As CAS during the Whitlam Labor government, which was generally antipathetic to imperial knighthoods, he was not raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) until the 1976 Queen's Birthday Honours, after the Liberal Party under Malcolm Fraser had been returned to power. Originally from Vaucluse, in Sydney's east, by 2010 Read was living in Safety Beach, on the New South Wales Mid North Coast. He died at Woolgoolga and District Retirement Village on 17September 2014.|$|E
5|$|Segrè was {{appointed}} {{assistant professor of}} physics at the University of Rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936, becoming one of the Via Panisperna boys. In 1934, he met Elfriede Spiro, a Jewish woman whose family had come from Ostrowo in West Prussia, but had fled to Breslau when that part of Prussia became part of Poland after World War I. After the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933, she had emigrated to Italy, where she worked as a secretary and an interpreter. At first she did not speak Italian well, and Segrè and Spiro conversed in German, in which he was fluent. The two were married at the Great Synagogue of Rome on 2 February 1936. He agreed with the rabbi to spend the minimal amount on the wedding, giving the balance of what would be spent on a luxury wedding to Jewish refugees from Germany. The rabbi managed to give them many of <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> of a luxury wedding anyway. The couple had three children: Claudio, born in 1937, Amelia Gertrude Allegra, born in 1937, and Fausta Irene, born in 1945.|$|E

25|$|Commonwealth, however, was reconstructed in 1918 {{with all}} <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> (such as updated fire control systems) of modern {{dreadnought}} battleships, {{so as to}} provide an adequate gunnery training platform.

25|$|Debendranath Tagore {{took over}} the reins of the Brahmo Samaj in 1843 and not only resurrected it but also enriched it in many ways. It became the {{inspiration}} for the Bengal Renaissance.

They were, however, considered members of the nobility since that was a social designation, not a legal one. Ministeriales were trained knights, held military responsibilities and surrounded themselves with <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> of knighthood, and so were accepted as noblemen.|$|E

25|$|As {{the number}} of shops grew, they {{underwent}} a transformation. <b>The</b> <b>trappings</b> of a modern shop, which had been entirely absent from the sixteenth and early seventeenth century store, gradually made way for store interiors that are more familiar to modern shops.

25|$|The {{opponents of}} the theory argue that Raj Darbhanga was never a kingdom but rather a zamindari with all <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> of princely state.

Further, after conquest of Bengal and Bihar, the British Raj {{initiated}} the Permanent Settlement, and the Raja of Darbhanga was recognised only as a Zamindar. Raj Darbhanga also paid yearly lagan (land tax) to old existing Zamindar of Darbhanga, Kachari at Khan Sahib ki deaorhi.|$|E
25|$|The core of {{the group}} that {{came to be known as}} the Pilgrims were brought {{together}} between 1586 and 1605 by shared theological beliefs, as expressed by Richard Clyfton, a Brownist parson at All Saints' Parish Church in Babworth, near East Retford, Nottinghamshire. This congregation held Puritan beliefs comparable to other non-conforming movements (i.e., groups not in communion with the Church of England) led by Robert Browne, John Greenwood, and Henry Barrowe. As Separatists, they also held that their differences with the Church of England were irreconcilable and that their worship should be independent of <b>the</b> <b>trappings,</b> traditions, and organization of a central church—unlike those Puritans who maintained their membership in and allegiance to the Church of England.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{rough terrain}} and a harsh climate, Sonora, {{like the rest}} of the {{northern}} Mexico, is rich in mineral resources. This has led to a history of self-reliance, and many see themselves as the heirs to a pioneering tradition. A large part of this is linked to the vaquero or cowboy tradition, as much of the state’s economy has traditionally been linked to livestock. Sonorans and other norteños (northerners) have a reputation for being hard working and frugal, and being more individualistic and straightforward than other Mexicans. Although most people in the state are employed in industry and tourism, <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> of the cowboy, jeans, cowboy hats and pickup trucks, are still very popular.|$|E
