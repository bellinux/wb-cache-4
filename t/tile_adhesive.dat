50|$|The Heart-Shaped Tub: Tiling - The contestants must lay tile {{on their}} tub decks. Neither Charlene nor Ajay {{are ready for}} tiles as their tub decks are not fully {{installed}} (and their tiles, and Dan's also, will be installed without waterproofing due to Matt having used up all their waterproofing in the last episode), so the experts assist in completing their decks so as {{to level the playing}} field. As for the challenge itself, after a brief one-line lesson from Geoff on how to use <b>tile</b> <b>adhesive</b> (to read the instructions that come with the adhesive), and a longer lesson from Gail on how to tile, the challenge begins in earnest. Charlene had chosen difficult glass tiles which require more finesse, while Matt and Rob use larger tiles; Dan's and Ajay's tiles are ceramic tiles of medium size. Dan manages to use his tile spacers incorrectly, but he tiles his entire tub before realizing his error; he runs out of time and fails before he can dig out the spacers. Matt manages to pass after several initial troubles with cutting tiles upside-down. Rob injures himself repeatedly, and has only two courses of tiles before he runs out of time and fails. Ajay also fails due to taking too long and installing his tiles in an asymmetrical manner, contrary to Gail's directive; he also manages to short out the light fitting in his room after failing to fit the water guard on his tile cutter, which consequently squirts a large jet of water onto the light. The difficulty of Charlene's work causes her to run out of time and fail, though most of the tiles which do not require cutting are up.|$|E

Due to the extremely high viscosity of the pore ‘‘solution’ ’ in these mortars, an analysis based on Stokes equation actually suggests that some of the smaller cement particles will be ‘‘carried’ ’ along with the drying pore solution to the top surface of the specimen where they are sequentially deposited. To verify this hypothesis, further experiments were conducted using either a coarse cement or a fine limestone as a total replacement for the commonly used cement. The X-ray absorption results are further supported by concurrent mass loss measurements on equivalent specimens for each experiment and by particle size distribution analysis of the final dried limestone/silica sand system as a function of depth.

With respect to thin-bed applications, particularly tile adhesives, the spatial distributions of latex, cellulose ether (CE), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and cement hydration products can be quantified. It is shown that capillary forces and evaporation induce water fluxes in the interconnected part of the pore system, which transport CE, PVA, and cement ions to the mortar interfaces. In contrast, the distribution of latex remains homogeneous. In combination with results from qualitative experiments, the quantitative findings allow reconstruction of the evolution from fresh to hardened mortar, including polymer film formation, cement hydration, and water migration.

40|$|Microorganisms behind {{ceramic tiles}} in {{bathrooms}} In this study {{the interface between}} the backside of ceramic tiles and the waterproof membrane was investigated for microbial growth in 13 bathrooms. This interface {{is made up of}} the backside of the ceramic tile, <b>tile</b> <b>adhesive</b> and the waterproof membrane. In every day used bathrooms water will accumulate in this particular environment. It is calculated that a tiled wall exposed to water in 15 minutes needs approximately six months to dry out since water is sucked, by capillary actions, through the grout joints between the ceramic tiles. The wall dries through diffusion forces and diffusion force is a weaker than capillary force and therefore the drying need longer time than the wetting of the wall with a water accumulation in the interface as a result. Samples were taken from areas where the wall and floor had been exposed to free water regularly, due to showering. Mould and/or bacterial growth was found on 69 % of the analysed specimens from the most water exposed places in the bathrooms. No such growth was found on the samples from the dryer areas. The results shows that although the environment behind the tiles may seem to disadvantaged for microbial growth, due to a limited amount of organic substances and due to pH values not favourable for microbial growth, such growth is possible when the moisture conditions are high. To our knowledge the microbial occurrence in this particular environment has not been investigated before...|$|E
40|$|Polymer-modified {{cementitious}} materials {{provide the}} base for building materials commonly used on modern construction sites. By adding polymers, the properties of cementitious materials can be extended to suit a variety of applications. With respect to adhesion properties, for example, the first patent of latex-modified hydraulic cement systems was issued in 1924 (Lefebure 1924). In the field of tile adhesives, latex-modification allowed thinbed application, a technique that is still standard because of its economic advantages with respect to application time and resource costs. Before invention of redispersible powders, the appropriate latex was only available {{in the form of}} dispersions. Mortar mixing was an important issue, which when improperly performed, often caused cases of damage at construction sites. The development of latex in the form of redispersible powders drastically reduced this problem, because it allowed the production of one-component systems or so-called “dry mortars”, which only require the appropriate amount of water to be added before application. Mortar properties were continuously improved by optimising the formulation or enhancing the system's components. Empirical approaches dominated, in which numerous formulations were compared with each other, in terms of physical properties of the resultant mortars. To further improve these properties at the present stage, an extended understanding of the mechanisms active during mortar evolution is required. Many of these mechanisms leave characteristic marks on the mortar microstructures, which, once recognised and related to the corresponding mechanism, can be linked with the physical properties. Therefore, the microstructure represents a major key to an improved understanding of the highly complex system of polymer-modified mortars. The cementitious, mineralic microstructures can be investigated by methods commonly applied in earth and material sciences. In contrast, organic compounds like polymers can form delicate and fragile structures requiring specific techniques that originated in the field of organic chemistry and biology. Therefore, the investigation of <b>tile</b> <b>adhesive</b> requires an interdisciplinary approach, in which methods from different fields of research are adapted and combined. As is common in applied research, the investigation of polymer-modified mortars is a tightrope walk between the complex, commercial system and model systems usually based on crude simplifications. The combination of both approaches might result in large forward steps in understanding, and new insights. The present study on polymer-modified, cementitious mortars tries to incorporate the previously mentioned requirements and is organised in the following manner: (a) methods of quantitative investigations, (b) influence of polymers on microstructure and physical properties, (c) changes of microstructures and physical properties during wet storage. a) The first chapter describes the new methods developed to quantitatively investigate microstructures in polymer-modified mortars. A combination of digital light, fluorescence and electron microscopy allowed the visualisation of different mortar components such as specific polymer components, air voids, cement phases, and filler minerals. In a second step, their occurrence and spatial distribution was quantified by image analysis requiring appropriate program routines, whose use and functionality is explained. To demonstrate the power of the new quantitative approach in the field of polymer-modified tile adhesives, a selected mortar formulation was analysed as an example. The results show that the mortar fractionated during application and hardening, inducing a variety of phase enrichments or depletions. The occurrence of these microstructural heterogeneities suggests the major influence that the microstructure has on the physical properties of the mortar system. b) In the second chapter, the microstructural evolution of the mortar and the mechanisms involved were investigated by using the methodology developed above. It is shown that water flux, induced by evaporation 2 and capillary forces of the porous substrate, played the most important role in mortar fractionation. It transported cellulose ether, polyvinyl alcohol, and cement ions to the mortar interfaces, where they became accumulated. In contrast, latex components did not migrate and remained homogeneously distributed within the microstructure. Combination of quantitative with qualitative investigations allowed a reconstruction of the mechanisms forming the microstructure during the different mortar stages. By correlating microstructural observations with physical properties (e. g., adhesive strength), skinning on the mortar surface of the applied fresh paste was found to decrease adhesion strength to the tile. As a consequence, it is the mortar-tile interface that dominates the properties of the entire hardened substrate-mortar-tile system. c) In chapter three the influence of wet storage on the microstructure and its physical properties are investigated. Wet storage represents an important test criteria on the durability of polymer-modified systems exposed to wet conditions in case of outdoor or bath room applications. Tests on individual polymer structures revealed that cellulose ether and polyvinyl alcohol redissolved in the pore water, whereas latices were water-resistant. Consequently, latex distributions in the mortar measured before and after wet storage were identical because latex remained immobile, but cellulose ether and polyvinyl alcohol distributions changed. By combining these observations with microstructural investigations of the failure surfaces, pore size, shrinkage and physical test data, we were able to show that changes in the mortar volume and reinitiated cement hydration caused a decrease of the mechanical properties during wet storage. Although they remained immobile, the latex films also weakened due to water uptake and swelling, which was shown to be a reversible mechanism.

40|$|To {{track down}} {{potential}} sites of material {{failure in the}} tile–mortar–substrate systems, locations and intensities of stress concentrations owing to drying-induced shrinkage are investigated. For this purpose, mechanical properties were measured on real systems and used as input parameters for numerical modeling {{of the effect of}} shrinkage of substrate and/or mortar using the finite element code Abaqus. On the base of different geometrical set-ups we demonstrate that stress concentrations in the mortar can become critical when (i) substantial mortar shrinkage occurs, (ii) substrate shrinkage can accumulate over considerable spatial distances, particularly (iii) in situations where the mortar layer is not separated from the substrate by a flexible waterproofing membrane. Hence material failure in the system tile–mortar–substrate can be prevented (or reduced) by (i) an application of the tiles after the major stages of substrate shrinkage, (ii) the use of elasto-plastic deformable <b>tile</b> <b>adhesives</b> which can react elastically on local stress concentrations, (iii) the implementation of flexible membranes, and (iv) a reduction of the field size by the installation of flexible joints...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{different strategies}} for the preparation of armoured polymer particles. Inorganic nanoparticles, such as clay platelets and Ludox colloidal silica grades, were used as solids-stabilisers in processes such as miniemulsion, suspension and/or emulsion polymerisations. These nanoparticles were either assembled at liquid-liquid interfaces for the stabilisation of monomer droplets or adsorbed onto solid surfaces {{in the case of}} poly(vinyl acetate) latex particles. Colloidal assembly was promoted by modifying the pH and/or the ionic strength of the dispersion medium, thereby tuning the surface properties of the nanoparticles. When prepared in miniemulsion polymerisation, latexes with controlled particle size distributions were obtained. Their diameter was dictated by the amount of solids-stabiliser (Laponite clay) or by the dimensions of the building blocks (Ludox colloidal silica). We developed a versatile emulsion polymerisation process leading to silicaarmoured poly(vinyl acetate) particles and showed that quantitative disc centrifugation analyses throughout the polymerisation process unravelled mechanistic aspects of particle formation and growth. Stability of the armoured particles was studied in dispersion and after spray-drying the hybrid dispersions. The thickness of the silica shell on the polymer particles had an important role in limiting polymer inter-diffusion upon film formation.

40|$|The present work aims {{to provide}} a {{fundamental}} understanding {{of the effects of}} cellulose ether (CE) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) additions on the hydration and rheology of cementitious <b>tile</b> <b>adhesives</b> (CTAs). The first part of the thesis focusses on cement hydration and involves the following three stages. Stage 1 : PVAs undergo hydrolysis in wet cement to release acetate groups into pore water solution. This stage, which focussed on the effects of these acetate groups on early cement hydration through the addition of the analogue acetic acid, showed that acetate addition had a mixed effect; the effect was enhanced with increasing acetic acid concentration up to the point at which surface adsorption of acetate reached the saturation level. Stages 2 and 3 : Stage 2 focussed on the effects of the degree of hydrolysis (DH) and the degree of polymerisation (DP) of PVA on the kinetics of hydration of Portland cement pastes that were modified by polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) addition. Stage 3 focussed on the effects of the same factors on the kinetics of hydration of Portland cement pastes modified using a mixture of CE and individual PVAs. This work was able to produce a detailed model describing the effects of these factors on the heats of hydration of cement pastes during the first 24 h. Further, the impacts of the DH and DP of PVA on the kinetics of the hydration of C 3 S were assessed through measurement of the calcium hydroxide contents of cement pastes aged for 24 h.

In 1963, the English Richard Tiles Ltd became a 50% partner in the company, renaming it to Philkeram - Richards S.A. This tripled the production and substantially increased the company’s exports.In 1966 Philkeram - Richards S.A. introduced, for the first time, the embossed tile, thereby increasing its exports to the EEC and the Middle East. The increased demand was dealt with investment in new equipment and the quadrupling of staff. In 1969 Richard Tiles Ltd merged with H & R Johnson Ltd, leading the company's title to be changed again to Philkeram - Johnson S.A. The invested capital reached 100,000,000 GRD, while the ownership structure is maintained at previous levels. The staff stood at 350 people and the sheltered company area covered 21,000 m2. In 1979, H & R Johnson was acquired by Nocros Plc, which today still owns 50% of Philkeram - Johnson S.A. In 1982 Industrial Mining S.A. is founded, which produces and markets building materials, with special expretise in <b>tile</b> <b>adhesives</b> and grouts.At first Philkeram Johnson produced only white square tiles (15x15 cm). Soon, however, the range spread to other colours. Then the company proceeded to install decorative machines that allowed the company to present a wider range of designs and colours, thus beginning the first exports. Development continued with the production of wall tiles of various dimensions as well as experimenting with and studying the production of tiles and flooring.After extensive research and testing, production began in new facilities in 1982. The main features of these facilities was not only flexibility in production but also a significant advantage in quality output. Foundations were placed for subsequent development in single-fired technology which were completed in August 1988. The production method of the single-fired tiles was based on Western European technology. Philkeram Johnson {{was one of the first}} units of its field who adopted and implemented this technology. This new method is automatic, producing high quality products, and is mainly used for flooring indoor and outdoor spaces, with the necessary technical specifications.In 1987, the company invested heavily in new technology. The same year a new product became available to the market, Kerastar. These are floor tiles for special purposes, made with the most innovative technological global developments and exceeding even the highest standards. The company participated in the exhibition tiles in Los Angeles, 1987, and was awarded second prize among 400 exhibitors, thus entering dynamically in the U.S. market.In 1994, Hippocampus S.A. was founded, focusing on the production of specific pieces for pools and accompanying ornamental tiles. The pool sector had to be separated, being an area which must strictly adhere to basic standards of safety and hygiene. Two years later, Philkeram Johnson was certified with the ISO: 9002, while Industrial Mining with ISO: 9001.In 2003, [...] "Jumpo I", a sophisticated production line is installed, an investment of €6.000.000 which radically changed the production structure of the company. Five years later, in 2008, the second sophisticated production line, [...] "Jumpo II", was installed, which premiered in October 2008 at an event attended by the Minister of Development. In these difficult economic times, the company dares to invest and modernize, expressing its willingness to strengthen and maintain leadership, but also continues to valuably contribute to society.|$|R
40|$|The method {{comprises}} the steps of: preparing a basic ceramic mixture with clay, aluminium and iron oxides, forming semifinished flat tile products by subjecting the ceramic mixture to pressure, firing the semi-finished product at temperatures such to {{transform it into}} a solid object having partly crystalline and partly glass structure. According to the invention, subsequent to the firing there are provided the steps of: - arranging the fired tiles in line so {{that they have the}} rear face facing upwards, - spreading a continuous or discontinuous layer of adhesive substance of the pressure sensitive type, in fluid/pasty state, on the rear face of the tiles, - applying a non-adhesive covering sheet on the layer of adhesive substance, said covering sheet being easily removable, - conditioning the tiles within packaging containers for the transfer thereof to sales/application points. Due to the invention, it is possible to produce <b>adhesive</b> <b>tiles</b> in a quick, mechanised and inexpensive manner, through a simple adaptation, using relatively simple and inexpensive machines, of a conventional production plant...|$|R

40|$|Stress wave {{attenuation}} studies during ballistic impact {{are presented}} for longitudinal tensile waves propagating along the planar direction within a ceramic plate made of hexagonal tiles bonded with an adhesive. When a stress wave reaches an interface between the ceramic <b>tile</b> and the <b>adhesive</b> layer, reflection and {{transmission of the}} incident stress wave takes place leading to attenuation of the wave. This is because of impedance mismatch at the ceramic-adhesive and adhesive-ceramic interfaces. This phenomenon {{is referred to as}} macro attenuation. Reflection and transmission of the impact induced stress waves would also take place at the interfaces between grains and grain boundaries within the ceramic plate. This would also lead to attenuation of stress waves, and is referred to as micro attenuation. Micro attenuation is modeled using the stress wave attenuation coefficient. Stress wave attenuation studies are carried out based on both micro and macro attenuation. An algorithm is presented for tracking impact induced planar stress waves and predicting their intensities and extent of attenuation. It is observed that stress wave attenuation is significant as the waves propagate within the ceramic plate. A combination of micro and macro attenuation would give the correct estimate of planar stress distribution around the point of impact. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
