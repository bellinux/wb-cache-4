5|$|After his {{marriage}} to Yanti, she ended her singing career to become a housewife. When the couple had children, Chrisye often had little {{time to spend with}} <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was busy performing or recording; however, he attempted to spend as much time with them as possible. In a 1992 interview, he said that his children did not want to follow in their parents' footsteps and become singers because they had seen the stresses it put on the family.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, Alexander {{travelled}} to Ecbatana {{to retrieve}} {{the bulk of the}} Persian treasure. There, his closest friend and possible lover, Hephaestion, died of illness or poisoning. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander, and he ordered the preparation of an expensive funeral pyre in Babylon, as well as a decree for public mourning. Back in Babylon, Alexander planned a series of new campaigns, beginning with an invasion of Arabia, but he would not have a chance to realize <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> died shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Moore's {{signature}} form is a reclining figure. Moore's {{exploration of}} this form, {{under the influence}} of the Toltec-Mayan figure he had seen at the Louvre, was to lead him to increasing abstraction as he turned his thoughts towards experimentation with the elements of design. Moore's earlier reclining figures deal principally with mass, while his later ones contrast the solid elements of the sculpture with the space, not only round them but generally through <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> pierced the forms with openings.|$|E

Contrary to the imposed {{security}} doctrines in place, Stauffenberg and his adjutant were able {{to pass through the}} closed Security Zone 3 checkpoint and proceed to the airport for the flight to Berlin. They succeeded in getting away before clarity of the events could be established by the military and security personnel at the Wolf's Lair complex.|$|E
5|$|As Chen {{was born}} in a culture other than the culture he now lives in, he tries to make games that appeal universally to all people. His goal with his games is to help video games mature as a medium by making games that inspire {{emotional}} responses in the player that other games are lacking. Although he and Thatgamecompany can and have made more traditional games, he does not plan on commercially developing any of <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> does not think that it fits with their goals as an independent video game developer.|$|E

One night, Priya, remembering her past life, visits Rao's house only to see Nagarjuna sleeping beside him. She leaves the house in tears. While Rao's attempts to court Anjali begin, Nagarjuna and Priya join Salsa dance classes where Priya constantly expresses her anger towards Nagarjuna. On Rao's birthday, 13 February 2013, Anjali proposes to him which he accepts. This makes Chaitanya very happy. Priya meets Nagarjuna there who is dressed as Radha Mohan, who reveals that he too recollected memories of his past life on the night she left the house in shock. He apologises for his wrong deeds and proposes her. She accepts his proposal and Rao is relieved.|$|E
5|$|Duvall, who had {{appeared}} in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), which Foote adapted from the Harper Lee novel, was involved in Tender Mercies as an actor and co-producer from its earliest stages. He said the script appealed to him because of the basic values it underlined and because the themes were universal even though the story was local. Duvall felt it portrayed people from the central region of the United States without parodying <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> said many Hollywood films tend to do. Duvall's early involvement led to rumors that he had requested Foote write the script for him, something that both men denied.|$|E
5|$|Haunted by {{memories}} of the prostitute, Chandru lures two prostitutes to lonely places and murders <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sees that woman in each of them. Rekha's female friend Pallavi comes to Bangalore to meet her, and telephones her for her residential address. The conversation is overheard by the Madam of a brothel, who misleads Pallavi. Instead of being taken to Rekha's house, Pallavi is taken to the brothel and forced into prostitution. Rekha and Raghunath search for Pallavi. Chandru comes to the same brothel and takes Pallavi in his car, but kills her. Rekha learns of Pallavi's murder through Raghunath; neither Rekha nor Raghunath are aware that Chandru is the murderer.|$|E

5|$|He did not tarry long there either: on December 12–13, {{he was in}} Kraków; on December 17, in Wrocław; {{and shortly}} after, he settled in Leipzig, where many notable Polish {{soldiers}} and politicians formed an émigré community. Soon he and some others began plotting an uprising against Russian rule in Poland. The politicians, grouped around Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Kołłątaj, sought contacts with similar opposition groups in Poland and by spring 1793 had been joined by other politicians and revolutionaries, including Ignacy Działyński. While Kołłątaj and others had begun planning an uprising before Kościuszko joined them, his support was a major boon to <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{was among the most}} popular individuals in Poland.|$|E
5|$|In , a new {{collectible}} item {{known as}} mini medals, resembling small gold coins with a five-pointed {{star in the}} middle, was introduced; {{they have nothing to}} do with winning the game, but they can be traded with a certain character for items. Players collect them throughout the game, primarily by opening chests, breaking pots and barrels, and searching in sacks and drawers. Horii introduced <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> wanted to have something players collected that were similar to the crests and orbs in the previous Dragon Quest games, but did not want to repeat the necessity for players having to collect a certain number of them before they could complete the game.|$|E
5|$|Lacaille charted and {{designated}} ten {{stars with}} the Bayer designations Alpha through to Kappa in 1756. He catalogued stars that became Lambda and Mu {{but did not}} designate <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> considered them informes as they lay outside the asterism proper. Baily considered them part of Musca, and Gould gave them their Bayer designations. Francis Baily also dropped Kappa, which he felt was too faint to warrant a name, and designated two adjacent stars as Zeta1 and Zeta2. These last two stars are 1° apart, quite far to be sharing a Bayer designation. Lacaille had originally labelled the fainter one as Zeta, while Baily presupposed he'd meant to label the brighter one. Reluctant to remove Lacaille's designation, he gave them both the Zeta designation. Altogether there are 62 stars brighter than magnitude 6.5 in the constellation.|$|E

Jeremiah takes Mulder to a mysterious field where they find a group of identical children; the girls all resemble Samantha at the age when she was abducted. Jeremiah tells Mulder that the cloned children are drones, workers used to tend the fields, incapable of speaking. After retrieving a gasoline can, Mulder tries {{to take one of}} the female clones with him. However, the Bounty Hunter arrives and chases <b>them.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> corners them in a large bee hive, the Bounty Hunter is crushed and stung repeatedly in a trap set up by the trio.|$|E
5|$|Patrice {{decides to}} perform the final scene of a {{vaudeville}} play he has written called La Pendule (The Clock). He explains the complex plot and characters: set in 1929 in a townhouse in Provence, the play involves the Duke of Ponfouy and his family, associates and household servants. He performs the scene, playing all the characters himself and exaggerating their voices and mannerisms. For Patrice's final act, he plays a recording of Rémi and himself from 1985, then sings a song he has written about Rémi and the accident. When the audience applauds the song, he criticises <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{does not want to}} be a famous comedian. After imitating a marionette, he performs his curtain call with a toy dragon; he dances with it and a sparkler, and flaps its wings to Johann Strauss I's Radetzky March.|$|E
5|$|Rehman {{originally}} represented England, {{and played}} {{for them at}} under-18, under-19 and under-20 levels. Becoming the first English-born Pakistani to don an England senior football shirt seemed too far away, however, {{due to lack of}} first team opportunities at Fulham. Due to his Pakistani parentage, and because he possessed dual Pakistani and British nationality, Rehman also qualified to represent Pakistan, and he eventually opted to play for <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> considered it to be a more realistic option. A lot of British Asian groups were against this and wanted him to fight more for an England place to set a standard for English-Asian youth.|$|E

5|$|Series creator David Wolstencroft {{believed}} that writing Tom {{was the most}} fun, yet the hardest work compared with other characters, because he was Spooks primary protagonist. Wolstencroft chose a job in Information Technology (IT) as the cover story Tom used in his relationship with Ellie, because he felt that in real life people are reluctant {{to ask questions about}} IT work. To portray the character, actor Matthew Macfadyen followed the scripts, {{and did not want to}} deviate from <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did not believe doing so would be useful. Macfadyen was also keen to explore parts of Tom from within him for influence.|$|E
5|$|The Cistercian monasteries in {{the north}} of England {{resisted}} the tax, claiming that they were immune to taxation. John put pressure on <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was {{in the north}} when the tax was announced, but the various abbeys appealed to Hubert Walter, by then Chancellor. Walter secured from the abbeys the promise of a group payment of £1,000, but in June 1200 the King rejected the offer. In October, the King returned from Normandy and resumed pressure on the monasteries, ordering the confiscation of all Cistercian livestock on royal lands after two weeks if a settlement was not reached. At the end of November, through Walter's intercession, the King capitulated and agreed to a Cistercian immunity from this tax.|$|E
5|$|The Shelleys {{moved to}} Windsor {{in the summer}} of 1815. Hogg visited them there when his {{workload}} permitted. They left England for Continental Europe again in May 1816, and Hogg resumed his visits after their return, but he was no longer as close to <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had been. This was in part due to his awkwardness with Mary, who was preoccupied with her efforts to finish writing Frankenstein. Percy and Hogg were nonetheless able to convince Mary to attend the opera with them on a few occasions.|$|E
