For {{the first}} <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> I’m really {{experiencing}} what that’s like because I {{used to always}} {{feel the need to}} be in a relationship; I didn’t like being alone. But this time I’m realizing that people come into your life for a season, and my last relationship served its purpose. I can’t sit here and cry about it, because it ended right where it should have.

500|$|During this {{intercourse}} I {{perceived the}} superiority of Miss Honora Sneyd's capacity ... her sentiments were on all subjects so just and were delivered with such blushing modesty though not without an air of conscious worth as to command attention from every one capable of appreciating female excellence. Her person was graceful her features beautiful and their expression such as to heighten the eloquence of every thing she said.

500|$|I had {{no doubt}} that Barbra would sing the hell out of 'We're Not Making Love Anymore' – and not just because {{she is one of the}} world's {{greatest}} singers. I began writing the song from the heart during my divorce, and Barbra sang it from heart in the studio.
