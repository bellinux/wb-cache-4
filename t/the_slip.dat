5|$|Barchans or {{crescent}} dunes {{are produced}} by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and <b>the</b> <b>slip</b> face point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto <b>the</b> <b>slip</b> face, where it accumulates up to the angle of repose of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When <b>the</b> <b>slip</b> face exceeds the angle of repose, the sand avalanches, which is a nonlinear behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then {{the addition of a}} further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche. Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like solitary waves.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper aims {{to set up}} <b>the</b> ball {{systematic}} <b>slipping</b> {{model and}} analyze <b>the</b> <b>slipping</b> characteristics caused by different factors for a ball screw operating at high speeds. To investigate <b>the</b> ball screw <b>slipping</b> mechanism, transformed coordinate system should be established firstly. Then {{it is used to}} set up mathematical modeling for <b>the</b> ball <b>slipping</b> caused by <b>the</b> three main reasons and <b>the</b> speed of <b>slipping</b> can be calculated. Later, the influence of the contact angle, helix angle and screw diameter for ball screw slipping will be analyzed according to <b>the</b> ball <b>slipping</b> model and slipping speeds equation and <b>the</b> <b>slipping</b> analysis will be obtained. Finally, curve of slipping analysis and that of mechanical efficiency of the ball screw analysis by Lin are compared, which will indirectly verify the correctness of <b>the</b> <b>slipping</b> model. <b>The</b> <b>slipping</b> model and <b>the</b> curve of <b>slipping</b> analysis established in this paper will provide theory basis for reducing <b>slipping</b> and improving <b>the</b> mechanical efficiency of a ball screw operating at high speeds...|$|R

5|$|Torque {{generated}} by the drive causes the induction motor to run at synchronous speed less <b>the</b> <b>slip.</b> If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as a generator, converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or braking DC chopper controls dissipation of this power as heat {{in a set of}} resistors. Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating.|$|E

5|$|Coastal Command sank 27 U-boats in 1942 {{and damaged}} 18 more. Some of these kills were {{shared with the}} Navy. Bomber Command, by contrast, whose {{priority}} garnered them greater resources {{at the expense of}} Coastal Command, failed to destroy a single completed U-boat on <b>the</b> <b>slip</b> until April 1944. Arthur Harris, GOC Bomber Command, deplored the use of aircraft for defensive purposes and insisted the threat would be checked by attacking production. An indication of the effectiveness of air tactics was the fact very few Allied ships were sunk within 600 miles of British waters by late 1942. Between June 1942 to June 1943, 71 enemy submarines were sunk by the command.|$|E

5|$|Dog racing was {{originally}} {{an extension of}} hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated {{were said to be}} 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. <b>The</b> <b>slip</b> would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing {{at the opposite end of}} the track waving towels.|$|E
5|$|For ships, unlike aircraft, one {{deals with}} {{incompressible}} flows, where change in water density is negligible (a pressure rise close to 1000kPa {{leads to a}} change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for strength only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation become critical because the high viscosity of water produces high shear stresses. Another consequence of high viscosity is <b>the</b> <b>slip</b> stream effect, in which the ship moves like a spear tearing through a sponge at high velocity.|$|E
5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary to cause the bike to deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to <b>the</b> <b>slip</b> angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E
50|$|Slips is {{a device}} used to grip {{and hold the}} upper part of a drill string to the drill floor on an oil rig. <b>The</b> <b>slips</b> are {{constructed}} as a collection of metal wedges, hinged together to form a circular shape around the drill pipe.

The outsides of <b>the</b> <b>slips</b> are tapered and meets a similar taper on the drill floor. Usually the pipe goes through a Rotary table - machinery that makes the pipe rotate.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the initial}} {{characterizations}} of tsunami earthquakes came from seismologist Hiroo Kanamori in the early 1970s, and additional clarity materialized following the 1992 Nicaragua earthquake and tsunami, which was evaluated to have a surface wave magnitude of 7.0 when analyzing short period seismic signals. When longer period signals of around 250 seconds were investigated, the shock was reevaluated to have a moment magnitude of 7.6, with a hypothesis that the slow nature of <b>the</b> <b>slip</b> of the event may have concealed its substantial extent. Sediment was thought to have contributed to a slower rupture, due to a lubrication effect at the plate interface, with the result being an earthquake signature that had abundant long period seismic signals, which could {{be an important factor}} in the tsunami-generation process.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the release}} of Ghosts I–IV and <b>The</b> <b>Slip,</b> a 25-date tour titled Lights in the Sky, was {{announced}} in several North American cities, and was later expanded to include several more North American dates as well as dates in South America.

40|$|AIM: To {{analyze the}} {{surgical}} {{results of a}} slipped medial rectus muscle (MRM) after hang back recession surgery for esotropia. METHODS: Twenty-one patients who underwent re-exploration for diagnosed slipped muscle after hang back recession surgery were included in this retrospective study. Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging was performed to identify the location of <b>the</b> <b>slipped</b> muscle. Ocular motility was evaluated with assessment with prism and cover test in gaze at cardinal positions. The operations were performed by the same consultant. Intraoperative forced duction test was performed under general anesthesia. The empty sheath of <b>the</b> <b>slipped</b> MRM was resected and the muscle was advanced to the original insertion site in all patients. RESULTS: The average age of 21 patients who hadconsecutive exotropia with a <b>slipped</b> MRM at <b>the</b> time of presentation was 17. 4 ± 5. 4 y (5 - 50 y). The average duration between the first operation and the diagnosis of <b>the</b> <b>slipped</b> muscle was 25 mo (12 to 36 mo). The mean follow up after the corrective surgery was 28 mo. The mean preoperative adduction limitation {{in the field of}} action of <b>the</b> <b>slipped</b> muscle was - 2. 26 (ranging from - 1 to - 4). All patients had full adduction postoperatively. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of <b>the</b> <b>slipped</b> muscle should be confirmed during the strabismus surgery. <b>The</b> <b>slipped</b> muscle may be caused due to insufficient suture and excessive rubbing of the eye. When divergent strabismus is observed after the recession of <b>the</b> MRM, a <b>slipped</b> muscle should be considered in the differential diagnosis...|$|R
5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} was {{the first}} tsunami earthquake to be captured on modern broadband seismic networks. The initial surface wave magnitude was estimated at 7.2. The shock occurred on the subduction interface between the Cocos and Caribbean Plates, an active zone of stress and deformation, and due {{to the absence of}} sediment on the ocean floor off Nicaragua, <b>the</b> <b>slip</b> propagated up-dip {{all the way to the}} trench bottom, a creator of large tsunamis. This occurrence of slip of a plate interface filled with soft subducted sediments caused the rupturing process to be slower than the average subduction zone thrust earthquakes while the focus of the earthquake was much shallower than the typical subduction zone earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. When understeering, the steering angle must be greater, and when oversteering, the steering angle must be less than it would be if <b>the</b> <b>slip</b> angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.|$|E
5|$|Brescia's {{army was}} easily dispersed, and Constantine quickly {{advanced}} to Verona, where a large Maxentian force was camped. Ruricius Pompeianus, {{general of the}} Veronese forces and Maxentius' praetorian prefect, was in a strong defensive position, since the town was surrounded on three sides by the Adige. Constantine sent a small force north of the town {{in an attempt to}} cross the river unnoticed. Ruricius sent a large detachment to counter Constantine's expeditionary force, but was defeated. Constantine's forces successfully surrounded the town and laid siege. Ruricius gave Constantine <b>the</b> <b>slip</b> and returned with a larger force to oppose Constantine. Constantine refused to let up on the siege, and sent only a small force to oppose him. In the desperately fought encounter that followed, Ruricius was killed and his army destroyed. Verona surrendered soon afterwards, followed by Aquileia, Mutina (Modena), and Ravenna. The road to Rome was now wide open to Constantine.|$|E

Bradman came in and Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. The English leader packed the leg side with fielders, including two short legs, and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman almost inside-edged the second ball onto his stumps, before defending uneasily for a period.
