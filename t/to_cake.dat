25|$|Climate {{is another}} factor that affects {{the success of a}} rumble strips installation. If they are {{installed}} in a northern climate, they may be filled or partially filled with a deicing salt and traction sand mixture. They may also be filled with ice. This is a particular concern in regions with freeze-thaw cycles requiring frequent deicing. Furthermore, strips filled with water, snow, slush, and ice may cause or aggravate occasional accidents. Generally, air turbulence and vibration from passing large trucks keep rumble strips clear of debris and ice, but this process may take several days. Moist traction sand tends <b>to</b> <b>cake</b> together or freezes, and is not easily dislodged by truck traffic. This is problematic on low-volume highways with frequent deicing, and can significantly reduce the effectiveness of rumble strips in winter months.|$|E
2500|$|To My Surprise {{found its}} name from people's {{reaction}} to their music, primarily based on peoples prejudice based on Crahan's most notable band Slipknot's musical style. Crahan {{went as far as}} saying [...] "I'd have to put a gun in my mouth if it was metal," [...] because he's already in [...] "the best metal band in the world". Their musical style has been noted to include; glam rock, new wave, pop, country rock, alternative rock and disco. They have been compared <b>to</b> <b>Cake,</b> The Strokes, Faith No More, Weezer, Syd Barrett, They Might Be Giants, Hater, The Presidents of the United States of America and Harvey Danger, among others.|$|E
2500|$|The group {{took part}} in the Unlimited Sunshine Tour the first two years. [...] The 2002 tour {{included}} headliner Cake, De La Soul, The Flaming Lips, Modest Mouse, and Kinky. In addition <b>to</b> <b>Cake,</b> the 2003 tour featured Cheap Trick, [...] "garage rockers" [...] The Detroit Cobras, and [...] "country legend" [...] Charlie Louvin of the Louvin Brothers. [...] In 2003 they served as Country Music Hall of Fame member Charlie Louvin’s backing band on one of his last nationwide tours. [...] They opened for Modest Mouse twice (a group founding member Tom Peloso eventually joined). [...] The group continued to gain [...] "a following as it traveled." [...] It has performed with such major acts as Cracker, Camper Van Beethoven, and Railroad Earth. [...] A tour in Europe featured events in Belgium and the Netherlands. Overseas they have performed in such cities as Antwerp, Amsterdam (...) , London, Dublin, Brussels, and Utrecht. At the height of their popularity they have played venues in major music towns like Seattle, Asheville, San Francisco, Minneapolis, Knoxville, New York, Portland, Baltimore, Atlanta, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Although, more recently the band has been relegated to clubs and bars in small markets, often struggling to draw more than a sparse crowd.|$|E

2500|$|Jeffrey Donovan as Michael Westen: [...] former US Army Special Forces {{soldier and}} a current CIA {{contractor}} {{who has been}} burned (identified as an unreliable or dangerous agent) and now finds himself {{in his hometown of}} Miami, unable to leave. With his assets frozen, he is forced to live off his wits and any small investigative jobs he can find while he searches for answers about who has burned him and why. Highly skilled and extremely clever, he can think on his feet, often improvising electronic devices and using ordinary items ranging from duct tape <b>to</b> <b>cake</b> frosting in highly unorthodox ways to complete a job. He has two black belts or, as he puts it in one episode, [...] "thirty years of karate" [...] and is [...] "rated with anything that fires a bullet or holds an edge". He has an uncanny ability to assume cover identities, working in numerous regional dialects and international accents; however, he cannot speak Spanish fluently. He believes that his unhappy childhood, largely at the hands of an abusive father, has helped to make him into a natural covert operative while also making close relationships difficult for him. He has a younger brother, Nate (Seth Peterson), who appeared in several episodes before being killed by a sniper in Season 6. Michael presents himself as a cynic hardened by experience but occasionally reveals a soft, and sometimes vulnerable, side. His favorite food is yogurt, which is featured or eaten by {{at least one of the}} characters in each episode. He has a romantic relationship with Fiona. In the series finale he and Fiona are living in Ireland raising Charlie (Nate's son) as their own child.|$|E

60|$|Ice commences {{to form in}} {{the shape}} of needles, which shoot out at angles from each other. In smooth water, under the {{influence}} of intense cold, the process is rapid, and a thin cake soon covers the water, and increases in thickness hour by hour. But when the sea is agitated the process is retarded, and the fine needles are broken up into what arctic navigators call sludge. This, however, soon begins <b>to</b> <b>cake,</b> and is broken by the swell into small cakes; which, as they thicken, again unite, and are again broken up into larger masses. These masses, by rubbing against each other, have their edges slightly rounded up, and in this form receive the name of pancake ice.|$|E

At a little distance sat Miss Baker; he knew that she at any rate was not violently attached to cards. Could he not say something?

60|$|Strangely enough, Cissy did not hail this {{corroboration}} of her dislike {{to young}} Masterton with the liveliness {{one might have}} expected. Perhaps it was because Piney Tibbs was no longer present, having left Cissy at the parsonage and returned home. Still she enjoyed her visit after a fashion, romped with the younger Windibrooks and climbed a tree in the security of her sylvan seclusion and the promptings of her still healthy, girlish blood, and only came back <b>to</b> <b>cake</b> and tea and her new hat, which she had prudently hung up in the summer-house, as the afternoon was waning.

60|$|Futilely protesting, Sprague and Stine were bundled on board. For half an hour, with axes, Kit and Shorty {{struggled}} {{to cut a}} way into the swift but solid stream. When they did succeed in clearing the shore-ice, the floating ice forced the boat along the edge for a hundred yards, tearing away half of one gunwale and making a partial wreck of it. Then, {{at the lower end}} of the bend, they caught the current that flung off-shore. They proceeded to work farther toward the middle. The stream was no longer composed of mush-ice but of hard cakes. In between the cakes only was mush-ice, that froze solidly as they looked at it. Shoving with the oars against the cakes, sometimes climbing out on the cakes in order to force the boat along, after an hour they gained the middle. Five minutes after they ceased their exertions, the boat was frozen in. The whole river was coagulating as it ran. Cake froze <b>to</b> <b>cake,</b> until at last the boat was the center of a cake seventy-five feet in diameter. Sometimes they floated sideways, sometimes stern-first, while gravity tore asunder the forming fetters in the moving mass, only to be manacled by faster-forming ones. While the hours passed, Shorty stoked the stove, cooked meals, and chanted his war-song.|$|E
60|$|That {{was about}} 1849. Tom Nash {{was a boy}} of my own age--the postmaster's son. The Mississippi was frozen across, and he and I went skating one night, {{probably}} without permission. I cannot see why we should go skating in the night unless without permission, for {{there could be no}} considerable amusement to be gotten out of skating at night if nobody was going to object to it. About midnight, when we were more than half a mile out toward the Illinois shore, we heard some ominous rumbling and grinding and crashing going on between us and the home side of the river, and we knew what it meant--the ice was breaking up. We started for home, pretty badly scared. We flew along at full speed whenever the moonlight sifting down between the clouds enabled us to tell which was ice and which was water. In the pauses we waited; started again whenever there was a good bridge of ice; paused again when we came to naked water and waited in distress until a floating vast cake should bridge that place. It took us an hour to make the trip--a trip which we made in a misery of apprehension all the time. But at last we arrived within a very brief distance of the shore. We waited again; there was another place that needed bridging. All about us the ice was plunging and grinding along and piling itself up in mountains on the shore, and the dangers were increasing, not diminishing. We grew very impatient to get to solid ground, so we started too early and went springing from cake <b>to</b> <b>cake.</b> Tom made a miscalculation, and fell short. He got a bitter bath, but he was so close to shore that he only had to swim a stroke or two--then his feet struck hard bottom and he crawled out. I arrived a little later, without accident. We had been in a drenching perspiration, and Tom's bath was a disaster for him. He took to his bed sick, and had a procession of diseases. The closing one was scarlet-fever, and he came out of it stone deaf. Within a year or two speech departed, of course. But some years later he was taught to talk, after a fashion--one couldn't always make out what it was he was trying to say. Of course he could not modulate his voice, since he couldn't hear himself talk. When he supposed he was talking low and confidentially, you could hear him in Illinois.|$|E
