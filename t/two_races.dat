5|$|The result meant Montoya {{moved up}} into fifth {{place in the}} Drivers' Championship, 83 points behind leader Michael Schumacher who {{clinched}} the title <b>two</b> <b>races</b> beforehand. Barrichello's third position finish allowed him {{to close the gap}} to David Coulthard. Williams' strong finish meant the gap between themselves and McLaren was reduced to eight points with <b>two</b> <b>races</b> remaining in the season.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into the}} 1995 season, Hill {{was one of}} the title favourites. The Williams team were reigning constructors' champions, having beaten Benetton in 1994, and with young David Coulthard, who was embarking on his first full season in Formula One, as team-mate, Hill was the clear number one driver. The year started badly when he spun off in Brazil due to a {{mechanical}} problem, but wins in the next <b>two</b> <b>races</b> put him in the championship lead. However, Schumacher won seven of the next twelve races, and took his second title with <b>two</b> <b>races</b> to spare, while Benetton took the constructors' championship. Schumacher and Hill had several on-track incidents during the season, two of which led to suspended one-race bans. Schumacher's penalty was for blocking and forcing Hill off the road at the Belgian Grand Prix; Hill's was for colliding with Schumacher under braking at the Italian Grand Prix. Hill's season finished positively when he won the Australian Grand Prix by finishing two laps ahead of the runner-up, Olivier Panis in a Ligier.|$|E

5|$|Nico Rosberg, {{driving for}} Mercedes, was the {{defending}} race winner.

5|$|Race {{stewards}} initially {{imposed a}} 10-place penalty on Coulthard and Barrichello, for changing their engines prior to qualification. Since 2006, the engines of Formula One cars {{are required to}} last for <b>two</b> <b>races.</b> However, after further investigation they rescinded Coulthard's penalty, as he had retired from the previous race and his change had been made {{before the start of}} the race weekend. Barrichello's penalty stood.|$|E

5|$|The {{next year}} Andretti raced once for the Williams team, after their driver Carlos Reutemann {{suddenly}} quit, before replacing the seriously injured Didier Pironi at Ferrari {{for the last}} <b>two</b> <b>races</b> of the year.

5|$|There {{were two}} driver changes {{heading into the}} race. JJ Lehto {{replaced}} Jos Verstappen at Benetton, the latter having replaced Lehto for the opening <b>two</b> <b>races</b> of the season due to an injury sustained by Lehto in pre-season testing. Aguri Suzuki was replaced with Andrea de Cesaris at Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Zerg {{buildings}} and units are entirely organic in-game, and all Zerg can regenerate slowly without assistance (though not {{as quickly as}} Protoss shields). Zerg production is far more centralized than with the Terrans and Protoss; a central hatchery must be utilized to create new Zerg, with other structures providing the necessary technology tree assets, whereas the other <b>two</b> <b>races</b> can produce units from several structures. Zerg units tend to be weaker {{than those of the}} other <b>two</b> <b>races,</b> but are also cheaper, allowing for rush tactics to be used. Some Zerg units are capable of infesting enemies with various parasites that range from being able to see what an enemy unit sees to spawning Zerg inside an enemy unit. In addition, Zerg can infest some Terran buildings, allowing for the production of special infested Terran units.|$|E

In the Constructors' Championship, Mercedes retained the lead with 83 points, 50 points ahead of Ferrari, while Red Bull in third was another three points behind.|$|E
5|$|At the Portuguese Grand Prix Hill charged {{from the}} back of the grid to third, having stalled on the warm up lap from pole. He {{finished}} off the season finishing fourth in Japan and third in Australia, but it was not enough to hold 2nd place in the championship as Ayrton Senna passed him by winning the last <b>two</b> <b>races.</b> Prost finished the season as champion. Hill ended the season in Australia by setting the lap record for the Adelaide Street Circuit. As of 2017 (the full Grand Prix track has not been used since 2000), Hill's lap record of 1:15.381 for the 3.780km (2.349mi) long track still stands.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{has participated}} in {{biathlon}} at every Olympics since 1984 except for 2002; Kerryn Rim's eighth place in 1994 in the 15km individual event was their best result.

Rim's result remains the only top-20 finish by an Australian in the discipline, and more than 80% of Australian entrants have finished in {{the bottom half of the}} field, including many in the bottom fifth.|$|E

5|$|Brabham {{had been}} working with the German engine {{manufacturer}} BMW since 1980 on the development of a turbocharged engine for Formula One. The BMW-powered BT50 made its debut {{at the start of the}} 1982 season, taking advantage of the high-altitude Kyalami circuit in South Africa, which favoured turbocharged cars. However, the as yet unreliable BMW-powered cars were dropped for the next <b>two</b> <b>races.</b> Piquet finished first at the Brazilian Grand Prix in a BT49D, but was disqualified after a protest from Renault and Ferrari on the grounds that the car had raced underweight due to its water-cooled brakes. FISA ruled that in future all cars must be weighed before coolants were topped up, resulting in a boycott of the fourth race of the season by most of the DFV-powered teams, including Brabham. Under threat from BMW, Brabham did not use its Ford-powered BT49s again until the sixth race of the season, the Monaco Grand Prix, where one was entered for Riccardo Patrese alongside Piquet in a BT50. Patrese won the race after a chaotic final lap on which several other cars stopped. Patrese used the BT49 for the next <b>two</b> <b>races,</b> taking a second place behind Piquet's BMW-powered car in the BT49's final Formula One race, the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Brabham {{used the}} BT19 once more that season to take pole {{position}} and {{victory at the}} non-championship Oulton Park Gold Cup, before using a new BT20 for the final <b>two</b> <b>races</b> of the championship season. The BT19 was used again at three of the first four championship races in the 1967 Formula One season, debuting the new Repco 740 engine at the Monaco Grand Prix, where it took pole position, and finishing second at the Dutch Grand Prix.|$|E

In the Carquest Auto Parts 300 at Lowe's Motor Speedway he led his first laps of the series (eight), but a mid-race accident relegated him to 39th place. Late in the season, Hornish drove one race in the Craftsman Truck Series (the Kroger 200 at Martinsville Speedway) for Bobby Hamilton Racing in its No. 4 Dodge Ram, starting 16th and finishing ninth.|$|E

After {{more than a year}} away from dirt track competitions, Roberts won the Houston TT race to tie Bart Markel's career record of 28 Grand National victories. He followed that the next evening with a third place in the Houston short-track national. Returning to England once again for the 1980 Transatlantic Match races, Roberts was once again the top individual points scorer as he led the American team to victory over the British.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, drivers who had reached Formula One often {{continued}} {{to compete in}} Formula Two. In 1966 MRD produced the BT18 for the lower category, with a Honda engine acting as a stressed component. The car was extremely successful, winning 11 consecutive Formula <b>Two</b> <b>races</b> {{in the hands of}} the Formula One pairing of Brabham and Hulme. Cars were entered by MRD and not by the Brabham Racing Organisation, avoiding a direct conflict with Repco, their Formula One engine supplier.|$|E
