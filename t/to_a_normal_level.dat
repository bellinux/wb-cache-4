5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>level</b> of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E
500|$|Stone hired a nursemaid to help {{care for}} her daughter, who was in poor health for several years, but she didn't trust her ability to provide proper care when Stone was absent. Stone {{eventually}} withdrew from most public work {{to stay at home}} with her child. [...] She resigned from the Central Committee, which organized the annual women's rights conventions. She began to suffer from self-doubt and a lack of drive in addition to the debilitating headaches that had plagued her for years. [...] She made only two public appearances during the Civil War (1861—1865): to attend the founding convention of the Women's Loyal National League and the celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the American Anti-Slavery Society, both in 1863. [...] Stone began to increase her reform activities back <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>level</b> after the Civil War had ended.|$|E
2500|$|Beck {{realized}} that ventricular fibrillation often occurred in hearts that were basically sound and he coined the phrase [...] "Hearts {{too good to}} die." [...] In 1947, Beck accomplished his first successful resuscitation of a 14-year-old boy using open chest massage and internal defibrillation with alternating current. The boy was being operated on for a severe congenital funnel chest. In all other respects the boy was normal. During {{the closure of the}} large incision in the chest, the pulse suddenly stopped and the blood pressure fell to zero. The boy was in cardiac arrest. Dr. Beck immediately reopened the chest and began manual heart massage. As he looked at and felt the heart, he {{realized that}} ventricular fibrillation was present. Massage was continued for 35minutes at which time an electrocardiogram was taken that confirmed the presence of ventricular fibrillation. Another 10minutes passed before the defibrillator was brought to the operating room. The first shock using electrode paddles placed directly {{on the sides of the}} heart was unsuccessful. Beck administered procaine amide, a medicine to stabilize the heart’s rhythm. Beck gave a second shock that wiped out the fibrillation. In a very few seconds a feeble, regular, and fast contraction of the heart occurred. The blood pressure rose from zero to 50millimeters of mercury. Beck noted that the heartbeat remained regular and saw that the pressure slowly began to rise. Twenty minutes after the successful defibrillation, the chest wound was closed. By three hours, the blood pressure rose <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>level,</b> and the child awoke and was able to answer questions. The boy made a full recovery, with no neurological damage.|$|E

5000|$|Epithelial {{oxygen uptake}} {{has been found}} to return to normal levels one month after {{cessation}} of contact lens wear. Epithelial thickness {{has been found to}} return <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>level</b> as soon as one week following the cessation of contact lens wear. However, endothelial polymegethism does not seem to return to normal levels even long after the cessation of contact lens wear. Even after a six-month period in which contact lenses are not worn, polymegethism seems to remain. Stromal thickness does not return <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>level</b> even after an entire month in which contact lens wear is halted. [...] The density of microcysts also remains as long as one month after contact lenses are removed, and microcysts do not disappear completely until two to three months after contact lens wear is completely halted.|$|E
5000|$|Blood {{return to}} the heart is {{enhanced}} by the effect of entry of blood which had been dammed back, causing a rapid increase in cardiac output (24 seconds on).

50|$|Systematic {{desensitization}} {{therapy was}} introduced by Joseph Wolpe in 1958 and employs relaxation techniques with imagined situations. In a controlled environment, usually the therapist's office, the patient will be instructed to visualize a threatening situation (i.e., {{being in the same}} room with a dog). After determining the patient's anxiety level, the therapist then coaches the patient in breathing exercises and relaxation techniques to reduce their anxiety <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>level.</b> The therapy continues until the imagined situation no longer provokes an anxious response.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) {{developed}} the first vehicle-to-grid aggregation system qualified by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). The system allows for owners of {{electric delivery truck}} fleets to make money by assisting in managing the grid frequency. When the electric grid frequency drops below 60 Hertz, the system suspends vehicle charging which removes the load on the grid thus allowing the frequency to rise <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>level.</b> The system {{is the first of}} its kind because it operates autonomously.|$|E

50|$|Other ITU-T 7 kHz {{wideband}} codecs include G.722.1 and G.722.2. These codecs are not {{variants of}} G.722 {{and they use}} different patented compression technologies. G.722.1 is based on Siren codecs and offers lower bit-rate compressions (24 kbit/s or 32 kbit/s). A more recent G.722.2, also known as AMR-WB ("Adaptive Multirate Wideband") is based on ACELP and offers even lower bit-rate compressions (6.6 kbit/s to 23.85 kbit/s), {{as well as the}} ability to quickly adapt to varying compressions as the network topography mutates. In the latter case, bandwidth is automatically conserved when network congestion is high. When congestion returns <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>level,</b> a lower-compression, higher-quality bitrate is restored.|$|E

50|$|Once diagnosed, {{a medical}} {{professional}} may treat cuboid syndrome by realigning (also known as reducing) the subluxed cuboid unless contraindications to manipulation are present such as gout, inflammatory arthritis, bony disease, neurovascular compromise, or a bone fracture. This form of manual {{manipulation of the}} foot should be done by a trained specialist, such as a podiatrist, chiropractor, osteopath, athletic trainer, osteopathic physician, or physical therapist. Further treatment may take into account other considerations, such as possible causes or aggravators (e.g. recommending that the patient be fit with custom orthotics if they are overprone). Fortunately, subluxed cuboids are generally quite treatable and most patients return <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>level</b> of activity once the pain is brought under control.|$|E

50|$|At {{high doses}} for the {{treatment}} of breast cancer, MPA can cause weight gain, worsen diabetes mellitus and edema (particularly of the face). Adverse effects peak at five weeks, and are reduced with lower doses. Less frequent effects may include thrombosis (though it is not clear if this is truly a risk, it cannot be ruled out), painful urination, anxiety, headache, nausea and vomiting. When used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia, more frequent complaints include reduced libido, impotence, reduced ejaculate volume, and within three days, chemical castration. MPA may cause reduced bone density though this appears to be reversible <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>level</b> even after years of use. At extremely high doses (used to treat cancer, not for contraception) MPA may cause adrenal suppression and interfere with carbohydrate metabolism but does not cause diabetes.|$|E
