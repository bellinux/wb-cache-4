5000|$|The {{land that}} Charles Noble farmed in {{southern}} Alberta sits {{in what is}} known as the dry-belt. During the period of drought known as the dirty thirties, farmland within the dry-belt, cultivated with mold-board plow and/or double disc and summer fallowed every other year, was subject to massive soil erosion. In 1935, while on a visit to California, Noble observed a sugar beet farmer using a straight blade tool to cut into the subsoil beneath the beets to loosen them for harvesting. He noticed that the blade was disturbing and killing weeds without burying them. Noble realized if he could apply a similar implement to the dry land back in Alberta thus leaving the crop stubble as [...] "trash" [...] on top to hold the soil and protect it from blowing the problem of soil erosion may be solved. He immediately fabricated a <b>tillage</b> <b>implement</b> patterned after the sugar beet harvesting tool. He called his invention the Noble blade. The next year he carried out all his summer fallow work using his invention. The results were so successful by 1937 he had fabricated 50 of the implements which he sold to friends and neighbors. By 1941 a factory was built within the village of Nobleford. Sales of the Noble blade occurred throughout the dry land farming areas of the world. The Noble blade is touted as one of the most important agricultural inventions of the 20th century. In 1982 the company that Noble had founded was sold to Versatile Manufacturing Ltd. Today, variations of the Noble blade, produced by all the major farm equipment manufacturers, have supplanted the mold board plow as the main <b>tillage</b> <b>implement</b> in use.|$|R

50|$|Porosity {{of surface}} soil {{typically}} decreases as particle size increases. This {{is due to}} soil aggregate formation in finer textured surface soils when subject to soil biological processes. Aggregation involves particulate adhesion and higher resistance to compaction. Typical bulk density of sandy soil is between 1.5 and 1.7 g/cm3. This calculates to a porosity between 0.43 and 0.36. Typical bulk density of clay soil is between 1.1 and 1.3 g/cm3. This calculates to a porosity between 0.58 and 0.51. This seems counterintuitive because clay soils are termed heavy, implying lower porosity. Heavy apparently refers to a gravitational moisture content effect in combination with terminology that harkens back to the relative force required to pull a <b>tillage</b> <b>implement</b> through the clayey soil at field moisture content as compared to sand.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiment}} {{was to determine the}} influence of cover crop biomass incorporated into the soil at different times and using different treatments on carrot emergence and growth. 7 species of cover crops were included in the study: Secale cereale, Avena sativa, Vicia sativa, Sinapis alba, Phacelia tanacetifolia, Fagopyrum esculentum, and Helianthus annuus.   			 			Number of emerged carrot plants significantly depended on the cover crop used and on the method of pre-winter and spring pre-sowing tillage. Carrot emerged best after a rye or oats cover crop. Regardless of the cover crop species used, the largest number of carrots emerged in cultivation on ridges. In other variants of no-plow tillage, number of seedlings was significantly lower and did not differ from that under traditional plow tillage. The highest leaf rosettes were formed by carrot growing after a rye or oats cover crop. The highest rosettes were produced by carrots in the treatments where tillage was limited to the use of a <b>tillage</b> <b>implement</b> in spring and the lowest ones after pre-winter plowing. The effect of tillage on the emergence and height of carrot leaves largely depended on weather conditions in the successive years of the study. The largest number of leaves was found in carrots grown after a buckwheat cover crop and in cultivation without cover crop, while the smallest one after phacelia and white mustard. Carrots produced the largest number of leaves after a sunflower cover crop and the use of a <b>tillage</b> <b>implement</b> in spring, while the number of leaves was lowest when the mustard biomass was incorporated into the soil in spring. The use of cover crops significantly increased the mass of leaves produced by carrot as compared to the cultivation without cover crop.

Conservation tillage could alleviate these problems. However, no-till {{can not be}} feasible for smallholder farmers in semi-arid regions of Ethiopia because of difficulties in maintaining soil cover due to low rainfall and communal grazing and because of high costs of herbicides. Strip tillage systems may offer a solution. This study was initiated to test strip <b>tillage</b> systems using <b>implements</b> that were modified forms of the Maresha plow, and to evaluate the impacts of the new tillage systems on water balance and grain yields of maize (Zea mays XX). Experiments were conducted in two dry semi arid areas called Melkawoba and Wulinchity, in the central Rift Valley of Ethiopia during 2003 &ndash; 2005. Strip tillage systems that involved cultivating planting lines at a spacing of 0. 75 m using the Maresha plow followed by subsoiling {{along the same lines}} (STS) and without subsoiling (ST) were compared with the traditional tillage system of 3 to 4 times plowing with the Maresha plow (CONV). Soil moisture was monitored to a depth of 1. 8 m using Time Domain Reflectometer while surface runoff was measured using rectangular trough installed at the bottom of each plot. STS resulted in the least surface runoff (Qs= 17 mm-season&minus; 1 ), the highest transpiration (T= 196 mm-season&minus; 1 ), the highest grain yields (Y= 2130 kg-ha&minus; 1 ) and the highest water productivity using total evaporation (WPET= 0. 67 kg-m&minus; 3 ) followed by ST (Qs= 25 mm-season&minus; 1 , T= 178 mm-season&minus; 1 , Y= 1840 kg-ha&minus; 1 , WPET= 0. 60 kg-m&minus; 3 ) and CONV (Qs= 40 mm-season&minus; 1 ,T= 158 mm-season&minus; 1 , Y= 1720 kg-ha&minus; 1 , WPET= 0. 58 kg-m&minus; 3 ).

Information is lacking on seasonal CO 2 efflux patterns, as affected by degree of soil disturbance/residue mixing and time of tillage operations. An experiment was conducted following a grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor] (L.) Moench. ] crop on a Norfolk loamy sand (Typic Kandiudults) in east−central Alabama to characterize soil CO 2 efflux patterns as affected by <b>tillage</b> <b>implement</b> (disk−type, chisel−type, and undisturbed) and time of soil disturbance (fall and spring). Soil CO 2 efflux assessment began immediately following fall tillage and continued {{for a period of}} about six months. Measures were also taken in the spring after imposing tillage treatments on another set of plots. Concurrent measures were also made on undisturbed plots. For fall measurements, increased CO 2 efflux was related to degree of soil disturbance. Losses were similar for the chisel and undisturbed treatments and lower than the disk treatment; cumulative efflux estimates also reflected such differences. With spring tillage, CO 2 losses for the undisturbed and disk treatment were similar, while the chisel treatment exhibited a slightly lower loss. Results suggest that selection of fall tillage equipment that maintains surface residue and minimizes soil disturbance could help reduce CO 2 loss. However, such considerations for spring tillage operations would not result in a substantial reduction in CO 2 loss...|$|R
