5|$|In August 2016, the Baku Chess Olympiad Operating Committee branded two {{double-decker}} buses of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism {{to operate in}} the city in the run-up and during the Olympiad. They were officially launched in late August with a ceremony during which members of the Azerbaijani national team were playing chess inside. <b>The</b> <b>buses</b> operated free of charge and took passengers to Baku's main sights. The passengers have the chance to play chess inside <b>the</b> <b>buses</b> and obtain information about the Olympiad. <b>The</b> <b>buses</b> ended operating on 14 September.|$|E

5000|$|Judge Arthur W. Garrity {{mandated}} and {{oversaw the}} desegregation of Boston Public Schools through busing, {{which began with}} <b>the</b> <b>busing</b> of black students from the Roxbury neighborhood to the white, working-class neighborhood of South Boston and vice-versa. The resulting crisis began {{with the implementation of}} <b>the</b> <b>busing</b> program in <b>the</b> fall of 1974 and lasted for several years. <b>The</b> Boston <b>Busing</b> Crisis ultimately became one of the North’s most notable desegregation battles.|$|R

5|$|More recently, preservationists persuaded Congress to {{designate}} , or about 89% of the park, as the Yosemite Wilderness—a highly protected wilderness area. The Park Service has reduced artificial inducements {{to visit the}} park, such as the Firefall, in which red-hot embers were pushed off a cliff near Glacier Point at night. Traffic congestion in Yosemite Valley {{during the summer months}} has become a concern. Two electric buses commenced service in September 1995. <b>The</b> <b>buses</b> are quiet and do not emit pollutants. Eventually, all <b>the</b> <b>buses</b> in Yosemite will be electric.|$|E
5|$|After the {{evacuation}} signal was given, <b>the</b> <b>buses</b> began {{to pick up}} passengers and head to the DAO Compound. The system worked so efficiently that <b>the</b> <b>buses</b> {{were able to make}} three return journeys rather than the expected one. The biggest problem occurred when the ARVN guarding the main gate at Tan Son Nhut refused to allow the last convoy of buses into the DAO Compound at about 17:45. As this was happening, a firefight between two ARVN units broke out and caught the rearmost buses in the crossfire, disabling two of the vehicles. Eventually the ARVN commander controlling the gates agreed to permit the remaining buses to enter the compound. General Carey's threat to use the AH-1J SeaCobra helicopter gunships flying overhead may {{have played a role in}} the ARVN commander's decision.|$|E

50|$|During {{its first}} year, route 96 was served by mostly D60LF New Flyer {{articulated}} buses. However, in 2005, OC Transpo switched to <b>the</b> new Invero <b>buses.</b> <b>The</b> seating capacity of those buses are {{much lower than}} <b>the</b> articulated <b>buses</b> which increases <b>the</b> risk of <b>buses</b> being full. <b>The</b> frequency of the route was increased due to <b>the</b> lower capacity <b>buses.</b>|$|R

5|$|Ordinary {{ticket sales}} from Morden South station {{increased}} from 9,840 in 1930 to 50,817 in 1938 but, from the SR's perspective, {{the line was}} not a great success.

A token fare of MYR1 should be paid for each ride.|$|E
5|$|Against these setbacks, the CTR {{still had}} a record year in 1928, with over 30 million journeys. But from 1929, <b>the</b> <b>buses</b> took to the narrow streets in the city centre, as well as routes with low tram traffic such as Chartreux, Maromme and the circular. The tramways {{continued}} as going concerns, and started large programmes of renovation and modernisation in {{the dozen or so}} years before World War II. Between 1928 and 1932, 75 first-generation trams were rebuilt to allow one man operation.|$|E
5|$|Even though Mangalore's {{city bus}} service is {{dominated}} by private operators, with routes covering {{the full extent of}} the city and beyond, Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) is plying buses in multiple routes. Two distinct sets of routes for <b>the</b> <b>buses</b> exist—city routes are covered by city buses, while intercity routes are covered by service and express buses. KSRTC operates long distance bus services from Mangalore to other parts of the state. The other key players who run bus services from Mangalore are the Dakshina Kannada Bus Operators Association (DKBOA) and the Canara Bus Operators Association (CBOA). There are also KSRTC JnNurm green colour city buses from State Bank bus stand. These buses travel to different parts of the city and its suburbs.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> private-owned <b>buses</b> {{are quite}} typical of Kolkata. <b>The</b> private-owned <b>buses</b> are of two types, the regular ones and the mini-buses. <b>The</b> regular <b>buses</b> are {{coloured}} light-blue and yellow. The mini-buses are of brown and yellow colour, and contain lesser number of seats. The mini-buses were {{started in the}} late seventies as a relief for the office commuters from <b>the</b> overloaded <b>buses</b> by being a sitting-only service, but this has given way to severely overloaded and crowded mini buses (and other buses too), largely due to the massive population of Kolkata.|$|R
5|$|Except {{those with}} an {{advertising}} livery, the trams are painted a light blue. The first series was delivered with a deeper blue color than has been tradition with Oslo Sporveier trams, but all have since been repainted to match the standard livery. Prior to the delivery of the second series, a single tram was painted deep red to match <b>the</b> <b>buses</b> and the T1000 trains used on the Oslo Metro. Due to negative feedback from the riders, the historic color was kept.|$|E
5|$|Later on 20 November, Šljivančanin and Colonel Nebojša Pavković {{informed}} {{the press that}} the JNA would provide buses to transport the wounded out of Vukovar. Instead, at about 10:30, <b>the</b> <b>buses</b> took the prisoners to the JNA barracks on {{the southern edge of}} Vukovar, where 15 men were separated from the group and returned to the hospital after being identified as hospital staff. During their stay in the barracks, the Croatian Serb TO and Serbian paramilitaries threatened the prisoners. Croatian Serb leaders opposed moving the prisoners to detention facilities in Serbia, claiming they wished to prosecute them for alleged crimes committed against Serbs. After spending two hours at the barracks, <b>the</b> <b>buses</b> took the prisoners to the Ovčara farm near the village of Grabovo. The group largely consisted of Croats, but also included several ethnic Serbs, Muslims, ethnic Hungarians, the French national Nicolier, and one German national who fought in defence of Vukovar. It also included Rašeta's nephew, who worked at the Vukovar hospital pharmacy at the time. The group of taken to Ovčara consisted of 261 people. Sources disagree as to whether the group included one, or two women, one of whom was five months pregnant. The age of the prisoners ranged from 16 to 72. The youngest among them was 16-year-old Igor Kačić.|$|E
5|$|Lothian Buses have {{operated}} city tours using white liveried coaches. Later, Leyland Atlanteans {{were employed in}} this same livery, with blinds for City Tour.

An Edinburgh Classic Tour was set up in 1989 using open top Leyland Atlanteans, and later Leyland Olympians, which competed with Guide Friday. This was as a result of Guide Friday introducing competition on the city centre to Airport route. <b>The</b> <b>buses</b> wore a blue and white livery, each carrying a name e.g.Scottish Star, Lothian Star and Highland Star.
