40|$|In {{patients}} with respiratory failure, extracorporeal lung support can ensure the vital gas exchange via gas permeable membranes but its application is restricted by limited long-term stability and hemocompatibility {{of the gas}} permeable membranes, which are {{in contact with the}} blood. Endothelial cells lining these membranes promise physiological hemocompatibility and should enable prolonged application. However, the endothelial cells increase the diffusion barrier of the blood-gas interface and thus affect gas transfer. In this study, we evaluated how the endothelial cells affect the gas exchange to optimize performance while maintaining an integral cell layer. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were seeded on gas permeable cell culture membranes and cultivated in a custom-made bioreactor. Oxygen <b>transfer</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>blank</b> and endothelialized membranes in endothelial culture medium were determined. Cell morphology was assessed by microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Both setups provided oxygenation of the test fluid featuring small standard deviations of the measurements. Throughout the measuring range, the endothelial cells seem to promote gas transfer to a certain extent exceeding the blank membranes gas transfer performance by up to 120 %. Although the underlying principles hereof still need to be clarified, the results represent a significant step towards the development of a biohybrid lung...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Contaminant carbon (blank carbon) was {{studied for}} {{its impact on}} the carbon isotope {{measurements}} (∆ 14 C and δ 13 C) of 3 organic compound classes of oceanic particulate organic matter. Two methods <b>of</b> <b>blank</b> correction and associated uncertainties were studied. First, the carbon blanks were quantified manometrically and the isotope ratios <b>of</b> the <b>blank</b> carbon were measured directly. Second, the isotope ratios <b>of</b> the <b>blank</b> carbon were estimated using the standard dilution method from the difference in ∆ 14 C values between unprocessed and processed standards. The 2 methods agreed within the uncertainties. The standard deviations of numerous ∆ 14 C measurements made on processed standard compounds were comparable to those <b>of</b> real samples. <b>Blank</b> correction using the standard dilution method is much less sensitive to the error in determination <b>of</b> <b>blank</b> carbon mass than is correction using the directly measured mass and ∆ 14 C values <b>of</b> the <b>blank</b> carbon. The standard dilu-tion method is recommended for correcting ∆ 14 C analyses of small samples that involve incorporation of a significant amount <b>of</b> <b>blank</b> carbon...|$|R

The purpose are to explain the essence of formation process of installation error <b>of</b> <b>blanks</b> in the HPM {{with regard to the}} shape deviation of abutting surface and to the natural deformations of satellite tables under the action of loads; to develop the recommendations for the providing of demandable accuracy <b>of</b> installation <b>of</b> <b>blanks</b> <b>of</b> body parts in the HPM. The complex phenomena accompanying the installation process <b>of</b> <b>blanks</b> have been opened and have been described by analysis. It was brought out that the blank during the attaching is under the action of system in forces and in force moments, which was formed casually, which causes not only its casual state with respect to the chosen system of reference but also makes the casual process of its deforming. The design procedure of elastic displacements during the installation process with regard to the natural and contact deformations in the system; the mathematical simulator of formation of installation error <b>of</b> <b>blanks</b> in the HPM in the satellite tables and the algorithm of its design; the logic circuit of specification of tolerance for the variables of installation process have been developed.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{regulatory}} effect of evodiamine on the malignant biological behaviors and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway of colorectal cancer cell lines HT 29. Methods: Colorectal cancer cell lines HT 29 were cultured and divided into blank control group and evodiamine group, and after different treatment, cell viability, proportion of different cell cycle {{as well as}} the contents of VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGFC, MMP 3, MMP 14, Wnt and β-catenin were detected. Results: (1) Cell viability: MTT value of evodiamine group was significantly lower than that <b>of</b> <b>blank</b> control group; (2) Cell cycle: proportion of both S phase and G 2 /M phase of evodiamine group were lower than those <b>of</b> <b>blank</b> control group, and proportion of G 0 / G 1 phase was higher than that <b>of</b> <b>blank</b> control group; (3) VEGF and MMP contents: VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGFC, MMP 3 and MMP 14 contents of evodiamine group were lower than those <b>of</b> <b>blank</b> control group; (4) Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway: Wnt and β-catenin contents of evodiamine group were lower than those <b>of</b> <b>blank</b> control group. Conclusion: Evodiamine can inhibit the proliferation of colorectal cancer cell lines HT 29 and down-regulate the expression of VEGF and MMP, and the effect may be achieved by inhibiting the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. ...|$|R
