Pubs that had existed from before the {{foundation}} of the Garden City continued – including the Three Horseshoes in Norton, The George IV on the borders with Baldock, and the Three Horseshoes and The Fox in Willian – continued to operate (as they do to this day), and undoubtedly benefited from the lack of alcohol to be had in the centre of the town, as did the pubs in neighbouring Hitchin and Baldock. New inns also sprang up on the borders of the town, one such example being the Wilbury Hotel which was just outside the town's border.|$|E

It was clear {{to him that the}} Government of the Ethiopian Empire would have to move from Addis Ababa. One {{possibility}} was for the government to relocate to Gore in the southwest and he sought comment on this plan. Initially his bearded chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs did talk, they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left was fighting for its life under Ras Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. They added that the tribes to the west were in an ugly mood. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was and <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was nothing for the Emperor to do but run for his life.|$|E

[...] Bill Condon, director of Beauty and the Beast, stated that the LEMONADE visuals in particular served as inspiration for the Beauty and the Beast film, commenting [...] "You look at Beyonce’s brilliant movie Lemonade, this genre is taking on so many different forms… I do think that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want." [...] Beyoncé's music videos explore many different topics and themes such as women empowerment, depression, affairs, and racial injustice, including [...] "Formation" [...] and [...] "Pretty Hurts". Her self-titled visual album explores darker music videos such as [...] "Haunted", which drew comparisons to Madonna's Justify My Love".
