This experimental study aims at contributing to the understanding of new dimensions of trust by exploring how risky and vulnerable trust may foster a <b>trustee</b> 4 <b>s</b> behavioural change. It investigates <b>trustee</b> 4 <b>s</b> positive reciprocity when the intentional vulnerability of the trustor is both manifestly salient and dependent upon the <b>trustee</b> 4 <b>s</b> revealed type.

Abraham is considered {{a man of great}} faith. What drove Abraham 2 ̆ 7 s faith? Was it an altruistic desire to serve God or was it a strong desire to have a family or an intertwining of both‘? This thesis proposes to examine how emotional family process shapes our faith and how faith development shapes our ‘families’.

The focus of chapter one is how God 2 ̆ 7 s story is intertwined with the story of the human family through the promise of God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant</b> Chapter two illustrates how the implicit story, the family emotional process, interferes with the explicit story of the church, the Gospel.

40|$|Drawing from D. J. McCarthy 2 ̆ 7 s {{findings}} on the family-properties of covenants, Part One analyzes various OT covenants between God and his people {{in terms of the}} father-son relationship as a basic interpretive category. Three covenant-types are differentiated (kinship, treaty, grant) by distinguishing which party swears the oath (both, vassal, suzerain). Kinship and covenant are correlated with oath-swearing and curse-bearing. Using canonical criticism, we classify and explicate God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenants</b> with Abraham (Gen. 15, 17, 22), and Israel (Sinai, Levitical, Deuteronomic, Davidic), {{in the light of the}} momentous occasions when God swore covenant oaths (e. g., Gen. 22 : 16 - 18; Num. 14; Deut. 32 : 40; 1 Sam. 2 - 3; Ps. 110 : 1 - 4). In Part Two, our findings are applied to Galatians 3 - 4 and Hebrews 1 - 9, to show how Christ 2 ̆ 7 s death fulfills the Old Covenant and ratifies the New Covenant grant of divine sonship, thus revealing God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant</b> faithfulness and merciful ingenuity in executing his plan to reunite Jews and Gentiles [...] by sharing in their common plight [...] to constitute one worldwide familia Dei. Arguments in Galatians and Hebrews are based on a typological correlation of the Abrahamic, Mosaic and Davidic covenants, which are advanced by the authors 2 ̆ 7 strategic deployment of OT texts cited according to their original contextual meanings. Diatheke in Gal. 3 : 15 and Heb. 9 : 16 - 17 is explained as 2 ̆ 2 covenant-oath 2 ̆ 2 (versus 2 ̆ 2 testament 2 ̆ 2), in the light of curse-bearing entailed by oath-swearing. Unique findings of our canonical-critical analysis include: (1) identifying Melchizedek with Shem, presupposed in the Targums, and (we argue) in Heb. 1 - 7; (2) the royal-priesthood of firstborn sons forfeited by the 12 tribes to Levi after the golden calf; (3) Israel 2 ̆ 7 s bi-covenantal constitution (i. e., the Deuteronomic and Levitical covenants); (4) in Gal. 3 - 4, the New Covenant is pre-enacted by the Abrahamic covenant [...] in Heb. 1 - 7, by the Davidic. The New Covenant precedes and supercedes the Old (i. e., Mosaic) covenant; (5) Gal. 3 - 4 shows how breaking the latter led to the Deuteronomic covenant curses; in Heb. 1 - 7, to the symbolic but ineffectual Levitical priestly covenant, both of which foreshadow Christ 2 ̆ 7 s curse-bearing death...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{covenant}} became a common construct of many theologians {{in the early}} part of the sixteenth century. Although it was a common notion, covenant theology varied in nuance among its theologians, depending on the needs and attitudes of the people to whom they brought this theological notion. In England, William Tyndale developed his notion of covenant as he translated scripture into the English tongue. To offset and overcome the power of the Roman clergy over Englishmen, he developed his covenant principles. Given full latitude, Tyndale believed his construct would move common Christians from ignorance to knowledge, from bondage to freedom, from unaccountability to responsibility. The sources for my work are primarily Tyndale 2 ̆ 7 s writings. Ample documentation will afford the reader the opportunity to look over my shoulder at these sources. In contrast to other interpreters, I will argue that there is a consistent theology and ethic of covenant throughout Tyndale 2 ̆ 7 s writings.

40|$|Beyond Redemption is a {{study of}} the imagery of {{redemption}} that structured American representations of Israel in the decades leading up to and including the 1967 war. In an interdisciplinary set of texts in the postwar decades, Zionism 2 ̆ 7 s redemptive mission is represented as being commensurate with a variety of ethnic, moral, and political identities in America. This dissertation argues that these idealized representations of the Jewish state 2 ̆ 7 s redemptive project—of modernizing the Holy Land, civilizing and regulating immigrant Jews, strengthening the Jew through physical labor and soldiery, and fulfilling God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant</b> after Auschwitz—based on a foundational assumption: the redemptive power of the modern nation-state. As both the agent and the object of this state, the 2 ̆ 2 new Jew 2 ̆ 2 of Israel appears in these texts as a fetishized figure, reflecting a fascination with Zionism 2 ̆ 7 s ability to remake global Jewry. Furthermore, this figure has appeared in the U. S. as the antithesis of the 2 ̆ 2 Arab Nazi, 2 ̆ 2 as part of worldview that relocates anti-Semitism from the vestiges of European to the radicalized arenas of the Middle East. On the one hand, this dissertation argues, the 1967 war catalyzed a constitutive pairing of the Holocaust with the Israeli army in the United States in ways that represented the Middle East as the site of a re-located war against anti-Semitism. Against this background of America 2 ̆ 7 s relationship to the Palestinian Question, Beyond Redemption suggests an alternative framework for conceptualizing the deliverance from oppression: one that centralizes, and contextualizes, power relations rather than identity politics. ...|$|R

Miss Sears structured the Museum around the farmhouse in which Bronson Alcott and his family lived in a communistic experiment from June 1843 to January 1844. She later added a Shaker building, an art gallery of early American itinerant portraits and Hudson River School landscapes, and a gallery devoted to the American Indian. As Miss Sears intended, the eclectic collection of the Museums forces the visitor to connect {{different aspects of the}} past, and the past with the present. This paper is my modest effort to make the same sort of connections through an examination of one aspect of the Shakers 2 ̆ 7 lives: the method by which they obtained and retained children who came to Shaker communities without their parents. Because Shaker theology required that community members subscribe to a creed of celibacy, new members could only come from outside a community 2 ̆ 7 s boundaries.

40|$|Ishodište ovoga rada je Post 17, izvještaj o Božjem savezu s Abrahamom koji se pripisuje svećeničkom spisu (Pg). Za razliku od drugih predaja, svećenički pisac izvješćuje samo o dva saveza: o Božjem savezu s Noom (Post 9, 1 - 17) i s Abrahamom (Post 17). Post 9, 1 - 17 služi kao zaključak svećeničke prapovijesti, a Post 17 otvara svećeničko izvješće o povijesti izabranog naroda i ima, za spomenutu povijest, programatsko značenje. Naime, prilikom sklapanja toga saveza Bog obećaje Abrahamu brojno potomstvo (17, 2 - 6), da će biti njegov Bog i Bog njegovih potomaka (17, 7. 8 b), te da će njemu i njegovu potomstvu dati u posjed zemlju Kanaan (17, 8 a). Ova tri obećanja provlače se kroz naredne tekstove svećeničkog spisa (Post 28, 1 - 9; 35, 9 - 15; Izl 6, 2 - 8) i postupno se ostvaruju. Prvo obećanje ispunja se u Izl 1, 7, a drugo u Izl 40, 34 - 35. Što se pak tiče obećanja zemlje, mnogi egzegeti danas smatraju da ono ostaje neispunjeno te da Pg završava u Knjizi Izlaska ili u Levitskom zakoniku, u tekstovima koji govore o uspostavi bogoslužja na Sinaju. Polazeći od Post 17, u ovome smo radu analizirali tekstove svećeničkog spisa koji se osvrću na Božja obećanja Abrahamu i izvješćuju o njihovu ispunjenju. Naše je istraživanje pokazalo da obećanje zemlje nalazi svoje ispunjenje u Br 13 - 14 * te da, suprotno vladajućem mišljenju, postoje solidni motivi za smještanje završetka svećeničkog spisa u Knjigu Brojeva (Br 13 - 14 *; 20, 1 - 13. 22 - 29; 27, 12 - 23). The {{referential}} {{point of}} this article is the account of God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant</b> with Abraham in Gen 17, which is attributed to priestly writing (Pg). The priestly writer reports only two covenants: God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant</b> with Noah (Gen 9 : 1 - 17) and God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant</b> with Abraham (Gen 17). While the covenant with Noah represents the conclusion of priestly prehistory (Gen 1 - 11), Gen 17 opens the narration of Israel 2 ̆ 7 s history and has, for this history, a programmatic function. When he made his covenant God promised Abraham numerous offspring (17 : 2 - 6), that he would be his God and the God of his descendants (17 : 7 - 8 b); and that he would give him and his offspring the land of Canaan to his possession (17 : 8 a). The priestly texts following Gen 17, i. e., Gen 28 : 19; 35 : 9 - 15; Ex 6 : 2 - 8, refer back to these promises and relate their gradual fulfilment. Scholars generally agree that the first two promises find their fulfilment in the book of Exodus (1 : 7; 40 : 34 - 35), while the fulfilment of the promise of the land is subject of debate. Namely, there is growing agreement in contemporary exegesis that Pg ends in Exodus or Leviticus, in texts which do not recount the gift of the land but the institution of cult (Ex 29 : 42 b- 46; 40 : 16 - 17 a, 33 b; Lev 9 : 23 - 24; 16). In this article, by taking Gen 17 as the starting-point, we have analyzed the priestly texts which are concerned with God 2 ̆ 7 s promises to Abraham and we have reached the conclusion that the promise of the land is fulfilled in Num 13 - 14 *, and that there are valid reasons to place the end of priestly writing in the book of Numbers. Contemporary research of the book of Numbers has shown that the dating of this book is very late, but still, some scholars attributed four accounts to Pg in this book: Num 13 - 14 *; 20 : 1 - 13, 22 - 29; 27 : 12 - 23. Our brief survey of these texts has revealed that these texts can indeed be ascribed to Pg {{on the basis of their}} content, terminology and specific stylistic features. Moreover, these texts refer to the fulfilment of the promise of the land. In fact, while the promise of the land in Pg is always formulated in the future tense (!tn weqatal / yiqtol; cf. Gen 17 : 8; 2 :, 4; 35 : 12; Ex 6 : 8),, in Num 13 : 2 we find the !tn participle, and in 20 : 12 - 24; 27 : 12 qatal. These occurrences point to the conclusion that in Num 13 : 2 God »gives« the land to the people by sending the leaders to »spy it out« (rwt; 13 : 2). The official representatives of the people, by spying it out (rwt; 13 : 21), take the land legally into possession. Namely, we know from biblical accounts that »walking« on a certain territory can designate taking it into possession (cf. Gen 13 : 14 - 17; 1 Kg 21 : 16 - 18). Subsequently, the qatal form !tn in Num 20 : 12 - 24; 27 : 12 confirms that for the priestly writer Israel has already received the gift of the land, even if the people have not yet entered it. The performed analysis, thus, suggests that Pg does not end in the book of Exodus or Leviticus, but continues and ends in the book of Numbers (13 - 14 *; 20 : 113; 22 - 29; 27 : 12 - 23). The priestly texts in Numbers do not only narrate the failure of the generation of exodus and their leaders, Moses and Aaron, to enter the promised land, but also confirm the people 2 ̆ 7 s receiving the gift of the land (13 : 21; 20 : 12 - 24; 27 : 12), announce the entering of the next generation (14 : 31) and report the installation of new leaders, Eleazar and Joshua (20 : 28; 27 : 22 - 23). The priestly writing would, therefore, have an open ending, since it prepares Moses 2 ̆ 7 death and the people 2 ̆ 7 s entering of the land, but it does not report them. This open ending could have been conditioned by the historical moment in which the priestly writer composed his work, i. e., at the end of the Babylonian exile and in the first years of return. His last accounts, which we now find in the book of Numbers, would then reflect the failure of the first generation of returnees to come back to the land, but at the same time, they announce the return of the next generation (14 : 31) ...|$|R

The trial court ruled in the tenant 2 ̆ 7 s favor and rejected the landord 2 ̆ 7 s contention that by remaining in possession the tenant had waived the failure to repair. The appellate division reversed and tenant appealed. The NJ supreme court held that the landlord had breached his covenant of habitability 2 ̆ 7 and that the tenant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant</b> to pay rent depended upon the fulfillment of the warranty of habitability. Prior to this holding the NJ courts had only recognized two tenant remedies – caveat emptor by allowing the tenant to vacate the premises when constructively evicted and the common law belief that traditional common law relationships were ill suited to modern living conditions and should be relaxed. This latter remedy, the warranty of habitability, gave relief to the tenant when his landlord failed to maintain the premises in a habitable condition. 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 This case does not present a fact pattern fitting New Jersey 2 ̆ 7 s available remedies since 2 ̆ 2 the tenant did not vacate the premises nor did she undertake the needed repairs herself and then seek to offset the expense so incurred against her obligation to pay rent. 2 ̆ 2 Due to this court’s holding, the tenant is no longer limited to the establishment of defenses in a landlord 2 ̆ 7 s action and can take the initiative establishing a new remedy for tenants. The trend in legislation and court decisions has been for the tenant 2 ̆ 7 s benefit and landlords’ duty has changed dramatically over {{a relatively short period of}} time, gaining equality in the landlord-tenant relationship...|$|R
25|$|Oil {{production}} in the mid-1860s brought the high-water mark of the Society's prosperity. By the close of Baker's administration in 1868, The Society's wealth was probably $2 million. By 1890, however, the Society was in debt and {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy with a depleted and aged membership. In addition, the Society faced litigation from previous members and would-be heirs. The Society's <b>trustee,</b> John <b>S.</b> Duss, settled the lawsuits, liquidated its business ventures, and paid the Society's indebtedness. The great strain which he had undergone at this time undermined his health and he resigned his trusteeship in 1903. With only a few members left, the remaining land and assets were sold under the leadership of Duss's wife, Susanna (Susie), and the Society was formally dissolved in 1905. At the time of the Society’s dissolution, its net worth was $1.2 million.|$|R
