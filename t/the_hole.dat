5|$|Groups {{are also}} applied {{in many other}} {{mathematical}} areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying {{the properties of the}} corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups. For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around <b>the</b> <b>hole).</b> This way, the fundamental group detects <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E

30|$|The goal of {{this paper}} was to {{describe}} bonding processes between steel and concrete specimens experimentally and by applying analytical and FE methods. The results of investigations on the bonding behavior between lightweight concrete and steel strips enable a better understanding on the use of lightweight concrete in wall panels. The results show that the experimental, theoretical, and FE simulation results match very well. Three geometrical parameters affecting the pull-out force were also investigated in this paper, namely the total area of <b>the</b> <b>holes,</b> <b>the</b> diameter of <b>the</b> <b>holes,</b> and <b>the</b> circumference area of <b>the</b> <b>holes.</b> <b>The</b> diameter of <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> or circumference area of <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> was found to give stronger correlation with the pull-out forces; however, weaker correlations exist between the pull-out forces and the total area of <b>the</b> <b>holes.</b> <b>The</b> strips with <b>the</b> greatest <b>hole</b> area, hole diameter, and circumference areas had higher pull-out forces, and the increase is nearly linear.|$|R

5|$|This {{species is}} a nocturnal forest-dweller that reproduces once in late March–May {{and once in}} September–December, having one or two young each time. During the day, the mother digs {{a hole in the}} ground, for her young to hide in. At night, she opens the {{entrance}} to <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> while watching for predators (such as venomous snakes), and then nurses her young, after which she closes <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> with soil and plant material by thumping on it with her front paws. Amami rabbits sleep during the day in hidden locations, such as caves. They are also noted for having a call similar to that of a pika.|$|E

40|$|Measurements of {{electron}} density and temperature by the Pioneer Venus orbiter electron temperature probe have been employed {{to examine the}} characteristics and morphology of ionospheric <b>holes</b> in <b>the</b> antisolar ionosphere of Venus. <b>The</b> <b>holes</b> apparently exist as north-south pairs which penetrate the ionosphere vertically down to altitudes as low as 160 km. Magnetic field measurements show that <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> are permeated by strong radial fields whose pressure is sufficient to balance the plasma pressure of the surrounding ionosphere. The electron temperature in <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> is substantially cooler than the surrounding ionosphere, except in the lowest density regions of <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> where <b>the</b> temperatures greatly exceed the ionosphere temperature. The low temperatures and the low densities of <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> {{are consistent with the}} strong radial magnetic fields which inhibit horizontal transport of plasma and thermal energy from the surrounding ionosphere. Plasma depletion processes associated with magnetotail electric fields may be important in the formation of <b>the</b> <b>holes...</b>|$|R
5|$|Alligators {{have created}} a niche in wet prairies. With their claws and snouts they dig at low spots and create ponds free of {{vegetation}} that remain submerged throughout the dry season.

5|$|An {{examination}} of the hull showed that a piece of coral {{the size of a}} man's fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off.

50|$|Unlike {{most other}} Indian forts, Bekal Fort {{was not a}} center of administration, for no remains of any palace, mansion or such {{buildings}} are found within the fort. Arguably the fort was built especially for fulfilling defence requirements. <b>The</b> <b>holes</b> on <b>the</b> outer walls of the fort are specially designed to defend the fort effectively. <b>The</b> <b>holes</b> at top were meant for aiming at the farthest points; <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> below for striking when the enemy was nearer and <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> underneath facilitated attacking when the enemy was very near to the fort.
