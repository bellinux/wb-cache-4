He attended lectures at the universities of Heidelberg and Leipzig before completing his doctorate at the University of Giessen in 1894, summa cum laude. His thesis Land und Leute zwischen Zambezi und Limpopo (Land and People between Zambezi and Limpopo) was mainly based on secondary material, {{rather than the}} materials collected and observations made by Muller himself during his time in East Africa. This limited the originality of the study, although in its time it was appreciated as an important piece of academic work, and was also published in a commercial version.|$|E

5|$|The Roman Empire conquered Dacia in AD 101 and 106, {{during the}} rule of Trajan, and the Roman {{settlement}} Napoca, established thereafter, is first recorded on a milestone discovered in 1758 {{in the vicinity of}} the city. Trajan's successor Hadrian granted Napoca the status of municipium as municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napocenses. Later, in the 2nd century AD, the city gained the status of a colonia as Colonia Aurelia Napoca. Napoca became a provincial capital of Dacia Porolissensis and thus the seat of a procurator. The colonia was evacuated in 274 by the Romans. There are no references to urban settlement on the site for <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a millennium thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} factor that negatively affects maintenance is the low and irregular pay that soldiers receive, resulting in the theft and sale of spare parts and even basic equipment to supplement their meager salaries.

5|$|As {{one of the}} company's major offerings, {{the chicken}} fries are {{sometimes}} the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the nu metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on a new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups. Even though the product has been a prominent part of the menu for <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a decade, Burger King has released very few limited-time (LTO) variants of the product – its first one being released {{in the summer of}} 2015.

5|$|Between 1946 and 1950, Snetkov was {{assistant}} {{chief of staff}} for operations of a regiment, and then entered the Military Academy of the Armored Forces, graduating in 1953. Until 1965, he successively served as a regimental chief of staff, chief of a division's operations staff department, and commander of a tank regiment. Between 1965 and 1966 Snetkov was chief of staff of a division, and in 1968 he graduated from the Military Academy of the General Staff. After graduating, Snetkov took command of a tank division in the Kiev Military District, and in May 1971 transferred to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSFG) as chief of staff and first deputy commander of the 3rd Shock Army.

5|$|The {{lectures and}} book had been {{originally}} scheduled for 2009, but were {{moved up to}} 2008 to avoid conflicting with Atwood's forthcoming novel after the latter book was delayed by its publisher.

Its release coincided with extensive {{media coverage of the}} recent financial crisis which led numerous critics to comment on the book's timeliness. In the Canadian market, the book peaked at #1 on The Globe and Mail bestseller list on October 25 and out-sold all previous Massey Lecture books. Critics found the book well-researched, thought-provoking, and humorous. Various reviewers found the discussions on the non-monetary aspects of debt to be <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book, while some critics identified the sections on ecological debt as the worse <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the book.|$|R
5|$|The rise {{to power}} of the Nazi Party on 30 January 1933 gave German motor companies, notably Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union, an {{opportunity}} to return to motor racing. Having secured promises of funding shortly after the Nazis' {{rise to power}}, both companies spent <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> 1933 developing their racing projects. Alfred Neubauer, the Mercedes racing manager, travelled to the Caracciolas' chalet in Lugano in November {{with a plan to}} sign him for the 1934 Grand Prix season if he was fit. Neubauer challenged Caracciola to walk, and although the driver laughed and smiled while he did so Neubauer was not fooled: Caracciola was not yet fit. Nevertheless, he offered him a contract, provided he prove his fitness in testing at the AVUS track early in the next year. Caracciola agreed and went to Stuttgart to sign the contract. The trip wore him out so much he spent much of his time lying on his hotel bed recuperating.|$|E

British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France and neutralising the threat of invasion. Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes, and by April 1805, the two had signed a treaty of alliance. Alarmed by Napoleon's consolidation of northern Italy into a kingdom under his rule, and keen on revenge for having been defeated twice in recent memory by France, Austria would join the coalition a few months later.|$|E

40|$|The {{historical}} {{report on the}} cholera epidemic of 1855, conserved in Ferrara City's archives allowed us to verify the probable relation between the environment and epidemic in a broad sense, using log-linear analysis and multiple logistic regression. Two thousand and thirty-three cases were analyzed and the quantitative/qualitative variables available from the report were analyzed in relationship with mortality and morbidity rates, considered as response variables. From {{the analysis of the}} quantitative variables, it emerges that the variables having a significant influence on the morbidity/mortality rates are the number of individuals and the average number of inhabitants per house. From the analysis of the qualitative variables, it emerges that all the descriptive variables {{of the state of the}} streets and houses express a strong association with mortality and morbidity. With the present analysis, data available [...] a detailed 'street by street' morbidity and mortality recording from cholera in 1855 in Ferrara [...] were analyzed with modern means and the overall picture that emerge is that in <b>the</b> <b>better</b> kept houses in <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town had less cholera morbidity and especially mortality...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{real time data}} {{have been used to}} compare the {{standard}} and triangle method by performing the objective analysis of mean sea level pressure. In the standard method, derivative fields are obtained from the grid point data using finite difference scheme whereas in the triangle method, a set of non-overlapping triangles are formed from the observations and the scalar and the spatial derivatives are computed directly at the centroid of each of the non-overlapping trian-gles. These scalars and their derivatives are then mapped to uniform grids by using the standard method. It has been found that objectively analysed scalar field obtained using standard method is superior to the scalar field derived by the triangle method, whereas the derivative fields pro-duced by triangle method are superior to the derivative fields produced using standard method. A variational objective analysis scheme has been developed and an experiment has been carried out with depression case of June (11 – 15) 2004.
