In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0.|$|E

5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E

5|$|An extinct {{relative}} of the fossa was described in 1902 from subfossil remains and recognized as a separate species, Cryptoprocta spelea, in 1935. This species was larger than the living fossa (with a body mass estimate roughly twice as great), but otherwise similar. Across Madagascar, people distinguish <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> fossa—a large fosa mainty ("black fossa") and the smaller fosa mena ("reddish fossa")—and a white form {{has been reported in}} the southwest. It is unclear whether this is purely folklore or individual variation—related to sex, age or instances of melanism and leucism—or whether there is indeed more than one species of living fossa.|$|E

5|$|Flies {{are capable}} of great {{manoeuvrability}} during flight due {{to the presence of}} the halteres. These act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly. The wings and halteres move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing the fly to turn sideways. The wings of the fly are attached to <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> muscles, those used to power it and another set used for fine control.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, German {{mathematician}} Petra Gummelt {{demonstrated that}} a covering (so called to {{distinguish it from}} a non-overlapping tiling) equivalent to the Penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> overlapping regions are allowed. The decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches, and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring. A suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a Penrose (P2) tiling. Similarly, a P3 tiling {{can be obtained by}} inscribing a thick rhomb into each decagon; the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs.|$|E
5|$|In {{theoretical}} physics, the anti-de Sitter/conformal {{field theory}} correspondence, sometimes called Maldacena duality or gauge/gravity duality, is a conjectured relationship between <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> physical theories. On one side are anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS) {{which are used}} in theories of quantum gravity, formulated in terms of string theory or M-theory. On {{the other side of}} the correspondence are conformal field theories (CFT) which are quantum field theories, including theories similar to the Yang–Mills theories that describe elementary particles.|$|E

As early as the Jin dynasty (1111–1234), the Jurchens conducted shamanic ceremonies at shrines called tangse.

5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{possess a}} dimitic trama, meaning {{that there are}} in its mycelia <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> hyphae. The first type is {{brownish}} skeletal hyphae, which provide stability to the fruit body. These hyphae run parallel to the bark and often have hairpin-like turns, so that the loops form thick-walled, cystidium-like structures, the so-called pseudocystidia. The second type is generative hyphae. They are translucent (hyaline) and serve to promote {{the growth of the}} fungus. Genuine cystidia arise in the hymenium and the layer directly below, the subhymenium. Both pseudocystidia and cystidia are encrusted, meaning that they feature crystal-like structures on the top.|$|E
5|$|The bohor reedbuck inhabits moist grasslands and swamplands {{as well as}} woodlands. It {{is found}} in <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> habitat in {{northern}} Cameroon: the seasonally flooded grasslands rich in grasses like Vetiveria nigritana and Echinochloa pyramidalis (in the Sahelo-Sudan region) and Isoberlina woodlands (in the Sudano-Guinean region). Often found on grasslands susceptible to floods and droughts, the bohor reedbuck can adapt remarkably well to radical seasonal changes and calamities. It is not so widespread as the bushbuck due to its habitat requirements. In some margins of its range, the bohor reedbuck shares its habitat with the mountain reedbuck. The ranges of the bohor reedbuck and southern reedbuck extensively overlap in Tanzania.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> {{oil shale}} in Estonia, {{both of which}} are {{sedimentary}} rocks laid down during the Ordovician geologic period. Graptolitic argillite is the larger resource, but, because its organic matter content is relatively low, it is not used industrially. The other one is kukersite, which has been mined for almost a hundred years and is expected to last for another 25–30years. By the end of 2012, the total kukersite resource was 4.8billion tonnes, of which up to 650million tonnes was recoverable. Kukersite deposits in Estonia account for 1.1% of global oil shale deposits.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Fracture {{surface and}} surface <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{membrane}} of antibacterial bone china, which includes 3 % and 5 % of weight of composite phosphate containing rare earth respectively, {{were characterized by}} SEM and nanoindenter, respectively. Nanohardness and nanoscale friction coefficients were measured by nanoindenter. Friction coefficients were conducted at the maximal load being 300 un, 500 un, 1000 un and scratching speed 15 um/s, 0. 75 um/s, 0. 5 um/s, respectively. The nanohardness and friction coefficients of ceramic membrane including 3 % and 5 % of rare earths are 2. 03 GPa, 0. 18282 and 8. 54 GPa, 0. 051998, respectively. The <b>two</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> ceramic membrane has stable nanotribology property. Obvious plastic flow and pile-up scratch impression of ceramic membrane including 3 % rare earths is observed by AFM in situ imaging, but scratch impression of 5 % has no plastic flow and take on the sink-in topography. Nanohardness and friction coefficients <b>of</b> this <b>two</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> ceramic membrane have strong relationships each other but weak relations with elastic modulus. ...|$|R

5|$|Ancestors were worshiped in Qatna; {{the royal}} hypogeum {{provided}} {{a large amount}} of data concerning the cult of ancestor worshiping and the practices associated with it. <b>Two</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> burials are distinguished; a primary burial intended to transport the dead into the netherworld, and a secondary burial that was intended to transform the deceased into their ultimate form: an ancestor. The royal hypogeum provides hints at the different rituals taking place during a secondary burial; a noticeable character is that skeletons were not complete, and no skulls are found for the majority of secondary burial remains. There is no evidence that skulls decayed as they would have left behind teeth, of which very few were found, indicating that the skulls were removed to be venerated in another location.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, there are <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|E
