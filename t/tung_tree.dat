50|$|Capps is an unincorporated {{community}} in Jefferson County, Florida, United States. It {{is located at}} the intersection of U.S. Routes 19 and 27. During the 1940s and 1950s, Capps was the headquarters of an agribusiness known as Tungston Plantation, owned by Everett P. Larsh, an industrialist from Dayton, Ohio, and managed by L. H. Crampton. Tungston plantation comprised a total of approximately 16,000 acres, of which about 8,000 acres was planted in <b>tung</b> <b>trees.</b> Each year, the tung nut was harvested and brought to the mill at Capps, and its contents processed into tung oil for use in paints, varnishes and other products.

5000|$|Tung oil or China {{wood oil}} is a drying oil {{obtained}} by pressing the seed from the nut of the <b>tung</b> <b>tree</b> (Vernicia fordii). Tung oil hardens upon exposure to air, {{and the resulting}} coating is transparent and has a deep, almost wet look. Used mostly for finishing/protecting wood, after numerous coats the finish can even look plastic-like. Related drying oils include linseed, safflower, poppy and soybean oils. The oil and its use {{are believed to have}} originated in ancient China and appear in the writings of Confucius from about 400 B.C.Raw tung oil tends to dry to a fine wrinkled finish; the US name for this is gas checking: this property was used to make wrinkle finishes, usually by adding excess cobalt drier. To stop this, the oil is heated to gas-proof it, and most oils used for coating are gas-proofed. Thus, to avoid the wrinkling, all tung oil available for finishing today is [...] "boiled".|$|E
50|$|The {{collapse}} of the land boom in 1925-1926 had not been as severe in Gainesville as in southern Florida, but did cool off the local economy. As a result, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 was not felt as strongly {{as in many other}} places. The city of Gainesville remained solvent throughout the Great Depression, and unemployment was lower than in most of the country. Agriculture continued to be a mainstay of the local economy. In 1922 tung trees were planted in Alachua County, and Gainesville became the center of tung oil production in the United States. Tung oil had previously been available only from China. Both tung oil and <b>tung</b> <b>tree</b> seeds were shipped around the world from Gainesville. The University of Florida, with about 1,000 employees and 2,000 students, helped stabilize the local economy during the Depression. In the middle and late 1930s various New Deal programs brought money and employment to Gainesville. Utility lines were extended, streets paved and sidewalks installed. The Seagle Building was completed and occupied by the University of Florida. An airport, Gainesville's first, was built.|$|E
5000|$|Vernicia fordii, usually {{known as}} the <b>tung</b> <b>tree</b> ( [...] , tóng) is a species of Vernicia in the spurge family native to {{southern}} China, Burma, and northern Vietnam. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree growing to 20 m tall, with a spreading crown. The bark is smooth and thin, and bleeds latex if cut. The leaves are alternate, simple, 4.5-25 cm long and 3.5-22 cm broad, heart-shaped or with three shallow, maple-like lobes, green above and below, red conspicuous glands {{at the base of}} the leaf, and with a 5.5-26 cm long petiole. The flowers are 2.5-3.5 cm diameter, with five pale pink to purple petals with streaks of darker red or purple in the throat; it is monoecious with individual flowers either male or female, but produced together in the inflorescences. The flowers appear before or with the leaves in loose, terminal clusters. The fruit is a hard, woody pear-shaped berry 4-6 cm long and 3-5 cm diameter, containing four or five large, oily seeds; it is green initially, becoming dull brown when ripe in autumn.|$|E
40|$|The forest {{administration}} reforms carried {{out during the}} Ryukyu Kingdom era from the 1730 's to 1750 's were spearheaded by Sai On and included the dividing up of forest supervision responsibilities, the preparation of various forest-related laws and the effective dissemination of forestry techniques. 'Tree Growing Methods' {{was one of the}} important documents promulgated during this period and it has four main aspects. The first is that it outlines in detail growing methods for a range of tree types, the main ones being the Cedar (Cryptomeria japonica), Tung (Vernicia fordii), Ryukyu Pine (Pinus luchuensis), Okinawa Urajirogashi (Quercus miyagii), Itajii (Castanopsis sieboldii), Isunoki (Distylium racemosum), Inumaki (Podocarpus macrophyllus), Iju (Schima wallichii ssp. liukiuensis) and Mokkoku (Ternstroemia gymnanthera). In terms of cultivating Cedar cuttings, the two methods employed are using slips (afforestation through direct cutting-planting) or seedlings (grown in nursery beds). In terms of where to plant Cedar cuttings, the best place is a wide area of land where the soil is deep and where embraced protection is good. <b>Tung</b> <b>trees</b> are planted by direct seeding. A few years later, in order to produce plenty of fruit, shoots {{from the top of the}} tree are picked. Ryukyu Pine afforestation is carried out by direct seeding, as is also the case with Urajirogashi, Hajii, Isunoki, and the like. Inumaki, Mokkoku and Iju forests are grown by planting seedlings cultivated in nursery beds. The second aspect concerns the growth of bamboo groves. In the case that a grove has begun to deteriorate, if the bamboo is cut it at regular intervals and entangled whisker roots removed the area will regenerate. In order to discern whether the bamboo is of the right age for use, every year mark the stem with a simple cut. A third aspect relates to the planting of trees to reinvigorate forest areas that have fallen into decline. In an expanse of Susuki (Miscanthus sinensis) grass clearings that are approximately five times the height of the surrounding grass in diameter are opened up and into these prepared clearings trees are planted. This five-fold numerical value is entirely consistent with current windbreak theories in terms of the most effective maximum windbreak distance. Because these cleared areas when viewed from a distance resemble the scales of a fish this planting method is known as the 'Fish-scale Pattern'. This forest planting method is thought to be of Chinese origin, based on the concept of qi in Feng Shui, and is a technique found nowhere other than in Hyukyu. The fourth aspect concerns the keyword 'embraced protection', which is a critical concept in the context of these forest growing techniques. 'Embraced protection' is a method of preventing the dissipation of qi by the winds. To these ends, mountain topography is utilized, and in the case that the area is topographically disadvantageous the 'embraced protection' environment can be corrected with forest planting techniques. This is a way of coping with wind damage in a small island environment, and is thought to be something that developed independently in Ryukyu. From the above we can see that from the 1730 's to 1750 's unique forest cultivation techniques that were adapted to the natural environment of Ryukyu had already been established. 琉球王朝時代の林政改革は 1730 年代～ 50 年代にかけて、蔡温らの主導で進められ、この時期に林野の管理区分、森林関連法の整備、林業技術の普及・啓発が行われている。「樹木播植方法」は、この様な時期に公布されたもので、その特徴は大きく分けて４つある。１つは有用樹種の育林方法である。主な樹種はスギ、シナアブラギリ、リュウキュウマツ、オキナワウラジロガシ、イタジイ、イスノキ、イヌマキ、イジュ、モッコクなどである。スギ苗の養成には、挿し木（直挿し造林用）と実生（苗床で育てる）の２つがある。スギ苗を植え付ける場所は、抱護が揃い、土地が広く深い所がよい。シナアブラギリは林地に直播きする。数年後、実付を多くするため、梢の芽を摘む。リュウキュウマツの造林は林地に直播きで行う。オキナワウラジロガシ・イタジイ・イスノキなどは林地に直播きする。イヌマキ・モッコク・イジュなどは苗床で実生苗を育てから林地に植えつける。２つは竹林の育て方である。衰退した竹林は、一定間隔に切り開き、根髭を掘り取り、再生させる。竹の利用年を考えて、毎年、幹に印を付けて年齢を判別する。３つは荒廃した原野の育林法である。ススキの原野では、ススキの高さの約５倍の広さに開き、そこを整地して、樹木を植え付ける。この５倍の数値は、現在の防風理論の最大防風効果距離と一致する。開地した場所の景観が魚の鱗状に見えることから、これを「魚鱗形」と称している。この育林法は、中国由来の風水思想の気の理論を応用したもので、他の地域では見られない琉球独自の技術である。４つはこれらの育林技術の中で、重要なキーワードとして｢抱護」の概念があげられる。「抱護」は風による気の散逸を防ぐ方法である。そのために地形を利用し、地形に欠陥がある場合には、植林の手法で「抱護」の環境を補正する。これは島嶼環境下における風害への対処法として、琉球で独自に発展したものと考えられる。以上ことから、 18 世紀の 30 年代から 50 年代には、すでに琉球の自然環境に適応した独自の育林技術が確立されていたことがわかる...|$|R

In this study, comprehensive analysis identified 75 and 81 putative Vf/VmAP 2 /ERF transcription factor-encoding genes in V. fordii and V. montana, respectively, which were divided into AP 2, ERF, related to ABI 3 and VP 1 (RAV) and Soloist families. After F. oxysporum infection, a majority of AP 2 /ERF superfamily genes showed strong patterns of repression in both V. fordii and V. montana. We then identified 53 pairs of one-to-one orthologs in V. fordii and V. montana, with most pairs of orthologous genes exhibiting similar expression in response to the pathogen. Further investigation of Vf/VmAP 2 /ERF gene expression in plant tissues indicated that the pairs of genes with different expression patterns in response to F. oxysporum tended to exhibit different tissue profiles in the two species. In addition, VmAP 2 /ERF 036, showing the strongest interactions with 666 genes, was identified as a core hub gene mediating resistance. Moreover, qRT-PCR results indicated VmAP 2 /ERF 036 showed repressed expression while its orthologous gene VfAP 2 /ERF 036 had the opposite expression pattern during pathogen infection. Overall, comparative analysis of the Vf/VmAP 2 /ERF superfamily and indication of a potential hub resistance gene in resistant and susceptible Vernicia species provides valuable information for understanding the molecular basis and selection of essential functional genes for V. fordii genetic engineering to control Fusarium wilt disease...|$|R

The city of Ichang was situated right in the center of China, on a low promontory on the North bank of the River Yangtze. It was a prefectural city of considerable importance in the province of Hupeh, and conveniently situated as a mart for the tea trade of Hoh-fung-chow. Opium was also grown in the district as was the <b>tung</b> <b>tree,</b> from which tung oil is extracted. During his stay in China, Aeneas wrote the poem Voice of an Oracle (in Old China). In December 1926, Aeneas received a worrying letter from the Church of Scotland offices in Edinburgh talking of anxious happenings in Hankow and the possibility of a General Strike in China. In the House of Commons the Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain intimated that the British Government were talking of taking immediate steps for the protection of U.K. nationals stationed in China. The letter also mentioned that alternative arrangements had been made for the Williams's children, Alfred and Beatrice. Soon after, Clara and their two children departed from China for their own safety and sailed to the U.K. Early in 1927, due to growing civil unrest in Ichang and localised uprisings in the surrounding province, Aeneas was advised by the British Consulate (Ta Ying ling-shih-shu) to leave China for his own safety. Aeneas departed Shanghai on 4 April 1927 just before the Shanghai massacre took place on 12 April 1927.
