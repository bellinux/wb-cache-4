Berry told the press, [...] "I'm just not as enthusiastic as I {{have been in the past}} about doing this anymore [...] [...] [...] I have <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> the world.

[...] Stipe admitted that the band would be different without a major contributor: [...] "For me, Mike, and Peter, as R.E.M., are we still R.E.M.? I guess a three-legged dog is still a dog. It just has to learn to run differently." ...|$|E

And privately I wished the stranger was {{in the bottom of the}} canal with a cargo of wheat on top of him. I was all in a fever, but he was cool. He said he was sorry to disturb me, but as he was passing he noticed that I needed some lightning-rods. I said, [...] "Yes, yes--go on--what about it?" [...] He said there was nothing about it, in particular--nothing except that he would like to put them up for me. I am new to housekeeping; have been used to hotels and boarding-houses all my life. Like anybody else of similar experience, I try to appear (to strangers) to be an old housekeeper; consequently I said in an offhand way that I had been intending for some time to have six or eight lightning-rods put up, but--The stranger started, and looked inquiringly at me, but I was serene. I thought that if I chanced to make any mistakes, he would not catch me by my countenance. He said he would rather have my custom than any man's in town. I said, [...] "All right," [...] and started off to wrestle with my great subject again, when he called me back and said it would be necessary to know exactly how many [...] "points" [...] I wanted put up, what parts of the house I wanted them on, and what quality of rod I preferred. It was close quarters for a man not used to the exigencies of housekeeping; but I went through creditably, and he probably never suspected that I was a novice. I told him to put up eight [...] "points," [...] and put them all on the roof, and use the best quality of rod. He said he could furnish the [...] "plain" [...] article at 20 cents a foot; [...] "coppered," [...] 25 cents; [...] "zinc-plated spiral-twist," [...] at 30 cents, that would stop a streak of lightning any time, no matter where it was bound, and [...] "render its errand harmless and its further progress apocryphal." [...] I said apocryphal was no slouch of a word, emanating from the source it did, but, philology aside, I liked the spiral-twist and would take that brand. Then he said he could make two hundred and fifty feet answer; but to do it right, and make <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> town of it, and attract the admiration of the just and the unjust alike, and compel all parties to say they never saw a more symmetrical and hypothetical display of lightning-rods since they were born, he supposed he really couldn't get along without four hundred, though he was not vindictive, and trusted he was willing to try. I said, go ahead and use four hundred, and make any kind of a job he pleased out of it, but let me get back to my work. So I got rid of him at last; and now, after half an hour spent in getting my train of political-economy thoughts coupled together again, I am ready to go on once more.] ...|$|E

Case studies are accounts of classroom interactions that pose a set of difficulties or crises to be analyzed.

High-quality teaching of mathematics at the university level is important to every country. Almost all of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> global economy require fluency in math-ematics, and a great many require advanced technical knowledge.
