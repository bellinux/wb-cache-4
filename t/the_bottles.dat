5|$|Smith {{operated}} his family's two {{dairy farms}} and a shop {{with his brother}} Frank {{in the village of}} Woolton. The farms had been in the Smith family for four generations. Smith delivered milk by horse and cart in the Woolton area. The raw milk he provided was stored in a large churn and was ladled out into <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> and receptacles of customers.|$|E
5|$|A {{battle of}} wits ensues between Waggett, {{who wants to}} {{confiscate}} the salvaged cargo, and the islanders. Waggett brings in Macroon's old Customs and Excise nemesis, Mr. Farquharson, and his men {{to search for the}} whisky, but the forewarned islanders manage to hide <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> in various ingenious places, including ammunition cases which Waggett ships off-island. When this is discovered, Waggett is recalled to the mainland to explain himself, leaving the locals triumphant.|$|E
5|$|During {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries, the mound of Cubzac was slashed all around to provide stone for Bordeaux's {{construction}} and the ballast of some river banks, creating deep excavations in the limestone. In 1898, André Cousteau, uncle of the researcher and ecologist Jacques Cousteau, started using the caves to make a sparkling wine based on traditional Champagne-making techniques. The wine, treated in a closed tank, bottled, and kept neck down many months at constant temperature, became bubbly and had its impurities accumulate near the cap. Once this deposit was removed, <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> were resealed by force, and the corks muzzled. In 1920, the Cousteau property was sold to the Société Anonyme Gay-Mousse. In 1966, the caves where entrusted to Monsieur Lateyron who, one year later, created the Café de Paris.|$|E
50|$|Scoring examples: If a thrower hits <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> {{directly}} and <b>the</b> defenders fail to catch both <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> and <b>the</b> disc, the throwing team earns 3 points, one for <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> hitting <b>the</b> ground, {{one for the}} disc hitting the ground, and one for hitting <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> directly. If <b>the</b> defending team catches both <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> and <b>the</b> disc, the throwing team only gets the 1 point (for hitting <b>the</b> <b>bottle).</b> If <b>the</b> disc hits the stake rather than <b>the</b> <b>bottle,</b> then 1 point is scored for each object that hits <b>the</b> ground (<b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> and/or <b>the</b> disc). If the defending team catches both, then no points are scored. If <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> is not dislodged, but the receiving team fails to catch the disc, the throwing team gets 1 point.|$|R
50|$|The {{object of}} Polish Horseshoes is to knock <b>the</b> glass <b>bottle</b> off <b>the</b> stake either by hitting it {{directly}} or by hitting the stake. If the disc hits the stake and <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> is knocked off, then 1 point is scored unless <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> is caught before {{it hits the}} ground. If the disc hits <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> directly and <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> is knocked off, then 2 points are scored if <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> hits <b>the</b> ground and only 1 point if <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> is caught before it hits the ground.|$|R
50|$|The label {{must also}} include {{the name and address}} of <b>the</b> <b>bottler</b> of <b>the</b> wine. If the {{producer}} is not <b>the</b> <b>bottler,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> will say that <b>the</b> wine was <b>bottled</b> by X bottled for Y producer. Table wines may carry the name of <b>the</b> <b>bottler</b> and <b>the</b> postal code. The label must {{also include the}} country of origin.|$|R
5|$|Two {{to three}} tablespoons of ReaLemon lemon juice has the {{equivalent}} of the juice from one average-sized lemon. Both ReaLemon and ReaLime are used as ingredients in various recipes, such as in baking, grilling, and as an ingredient in marinades and salad dressings. ReaLemon can be used as an ingredient in hot tea, lemonade and hot lemonade, and in various cooked dishes and baked goods such as pies. ReaLemon and other lemon juices can be used to prevent browning discoloration from occurring in peeled or sliced potatoes. This is performed by soaking the sliced potatoes in a mixture of the lemon juice and water. Both ReaLemon and ReaLime must be refrigerated after <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> are opened.|$|E
5|$|Shilts made {{comparisons}} to the government's disparate {{reaction to the}} Chicago Tylenol murders, and the recent emergence of Legionnaire's Disease in 1977. In October 1982, seven people died after ingesting cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. The New York Times wrote a front-page story about the Tylenol scare every day in October, and produced 33 more stories about the issue after that. More than 100 law enforcement agents, and 1,100 Food and Drug Administration employees worked on the case. Johnson & Johnson disclosed they spent $100million attempting to uncover who had tampered with <b>the</b> <b>bottles.</b> In October 1982, 634 people were reported having AIDS, and of those, 260 had died. The New York Times wrote three stories in 1981 and three more stories in 1982 about AIDS, none on the front page. The Tylenol Crisis was a criminal act of product-tampering; Legionnaire's Disease was a public health emergency. Twenty-nine members of the American Legion died in 1976 at a convention in Philadelphia. The National Institute of Health spent $34,841 per death of Legionnaire's Disease. In contrast, the NIH spent $3,225 in 1981 and about $8,991 in 1982 for each person who died of AIDS.|$|E
25|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem in}} the soft drinks industry {{was the lack of}} an effective sealing of <b>the</b> <b>bottles.</b> Carbonated drink bottles are under great pressure from the gas, so inventors tried to find the best way to prevent the carbon dioxide or bubbles from escaping. <b>The</b> <b>bottles</b> could also explode if the pressure was too great. Hiram Codd devised a patented bottling machine while working at a small mineral water works in the Caledonian Road, Islington, in London in 1870. His Codd-neck bottle was designed to enclose a marble and a rubber washer in the neck. <b>The</b> <b>bottles</b> were filled upside down, and pressure of the gas in the bottle forced the marble against the washer, sealing in the carbonation. The bottle was pinched into a special shape to provide a chamber into which the marble was pushed to open the bottle. This prevented the marble from blocking the neck as the drink was poured.|$|E
50|$|The Djadadjii {{will force}} the vampire into <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> Due to its thirst for blood, the Kroijac will enter <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> if not {{forced by the}} holy symbols. Then, the vampire hunter will lock <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> and throw it into a burning fire. <b>The</b> <b>bottle</b> will break, killing the vampire.|$|R
5000|$|Use as a {{dispenser}} for plastic grocery bags. Cut off {{the bottom}} of <b>the</b> <b>bottle,</b> place bags (one at a time) into <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> Pull out one bag at a time from the neck of <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b>|$|R
25|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of {{spilling}} or spraying any Champagne, open <b>the</b> Champagne <b>bottle</b> by holding <b>the</b> cork and rotating <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> at an angle in order to ease out the stopper. This method, as opposed to pulling the cork out, prevents the cork from flying out of <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> at speed. Also, holding <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> at an angle allows air in and helps prevent the champagne from geysering out of <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b>|$|R
25|$|Like {{most other}} things in Wolfe's life, his beer {{drinking}} is bound by ritual. Seated at his desk, Wolfe presses the button twice to ring for beer, and Fritz delivers <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> unopened; Wolfe uncaps <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> himself, using an 18-carat gold bottle opener {{given to him by}} a satisfied client. He never drinks directly from the bottle, but instead pours the beer into a glass and lets the foam settle to an appropriate level before drinking. He keeps the gold opener in the center drawer of his desk, where he also keeps the bottlecaps as a means of tracking his daily/weekly consumption.|$|E
25|$|After packaging, <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> are {{immediately}} sealed {{to retain the}} freshness and preserve the shelf-life of the product. The final step is cooling the product via cold air or water to maintain its flavour.|$|E

5000|$|It makes <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> {{easier to}} clean prior to filling with wine. When {{a stream of}} water is {{injected}} into <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> and impacts <b>the</b> punt, it is distributed throughout the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> and removes residues.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>bottle</b> {{has to be}} {{put under}} the moon to absorb its energy {{so that it will}} be strong. Blood is dripped into <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> every 14th of the month. Corpse oil has to be {{refilled}} if the levels drop in <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b>|$|R
50|$|MarkingsModern bottles, when moulded, will {{be given}} marks on the heel (bottom) of <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> These marks serve a variety of purposes, such as {{identifying}} the machine used {{in the production of}} <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> (for quality control purposes), showing the manufacturer of <b>the</b> <b>bottle,</b> how much to fill <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> to, <b>the</b> date <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> was manufactured, as well as other information. Embossing on a bottle consists of raised lettering, numbers, and/or designs which were intended to inform the purchaser in some way of the contents or to establish ownership of <b>the</b> bottle.ClosuresGlass <b>bottles</b> have a variety of closures to seal up <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> and prevent <b>the</b> contents escape. Early bottles were sealed with wax, and later stoppered with a cork. More common today are screw caps and stoppers.|$|R

25|$|Single cask (also {{known as}} single barrel) whiskies are bottled from an {{individual}} cask, and often <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> are labelled with specific barrel and bottle numbers. The taste of these whiskies may vary substantially from cask to cask within a brand.|$|E
25|$|The common {{physical}} {{model of a}} Klein bottle is a similar construction.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>bottle,</b> more {{precisely}} a metal or plastic cylinder, is lowered on a cable into the ocean, {{and when it}} has reached the required depth, a brass weight called a [...] "messenger" [...] is dropped down the cable. When the weight reaches <b>the</b> <b>bottle,</b> <b>the</b> impact tips <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> upside down and trips a spring-loaded valve at the end, trapping the water sample inside. <b>The</b> <b>bottle</b> and sample are then retrieved by hauling in the cable.|$|R
50|$|To install <b>the</b> <b>bottle,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> is tipped {{upside down}} and set onto the dispenser; a probe {{punctures}} the cap of <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> and allows <b>the</b> water to flow into the machine's internal reservoir.

25|$|By August 1940, the War Office {{produced}} training {{instructions for}} the creation and use of Molotov cocktails.

25|$|Alcoholic {{fermentation}} is {{not completely}} finished when the wine is bottled. It follows that the carbon dioxide is produced by the fermenting yeasts, and where malolactic fermentation has not yet taken place. Unlike the traditional method there is no disgorging and dosage, but the wine is normally filtered. To accomplish this <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> are emptied, then cleaned and refilled.|$|E
25|$|The wine is {{fermented}} once on {{the barrel}} and then undergoes a second fermentation in the bottle after the addition of yeast, nutrients for the yeast, and sugar (known as tirage). The second fermentation results in a natural sparkling wine. Yeast precipitate (lees) must then be removed. This begins with riddling (remuage in French) which means that <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> are turned with the neck downwards and lightly shaken to move the lees to {{the neck of the}} bottle. This is done in small steps where the bottle orientation gradually changes. Finally the inverted bottle necks are cooled so that the precipitation freezes to a small block of ice, <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> are turned upright and the temporary closure (normally a crown cap) is opened so that the precipitate is pushed out by the pressure in the bottle. Then the bottle is filled to replace the missing volume, and fitted with a plain Champagne cork and halter. The process to remove lees is called disgorging.|$|E
40|$|Novel bottle microresonators {{fabricated}} {{from standard}} telecommunications optical fiber were recently shown to support helical whispering gallery modes (WGMs) extending along <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> length between <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> necks. Intensity maxima were observed around the turning points {{on both sides}} close to <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> necks where <b>the</b> WGMs are effectively reflected. Selective excitation {{on one side of}} <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> microresonator leads to strong power localization at a symmetrically located turning point for the WGMs and can potentially be exploited to form effective add-drop filters. Channel dropping characteristics have been studied experimentally {{for the first time in}} this novel type of microresonator. A tapered optical fiber (drawn down to 2 - 3 microns in diameter with effective index of approximately 1. 2) was placed on one side of <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> to excite <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> WGMs. A similar tapered fiber placed symmetrically on the other side of <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> acted as a probe to extract the excited modes. We have successfully extracted power from all the resonance wavelengths using the probe placed at appropriate positions along <b>the</b> <b>bottle,</b> leading to <b>the</b> potential to construct efficient all fiber add-drop filters...|$|R
40|$|This is an {{extension}} of the shooter/dropper demonstration. A projectile is aimed at a bottle and shot at {{it at the same time}} that <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> is released from rest, as indicated in Figure 1. Because the projectile was aimed at <b>the</b> <b>bottle,</b> in <b>the</b> absence of gravity it would move along a straight line and strike <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> <b>The</b> acceleration of gravity acts on both the projectile and <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> In <b>the</b> time that the projectile takes to move to the vertical line directly under <b>the</b> <b>bottle,</b> <b>the</b> projectile has "fallen" the same distance away from the line it would follow in zero-gravity as <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> has fallen from the magnet. Since that is always true, when they reach the same horizontal position they must collide. This illustrates that the horizontal and vertical velocity components are independent and that the acceleration of gravity acts on both objects equally independent of their initial states of motion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract When <b>the</b> compress-air <b>bottle</b> is used {{it appears}} a {{phenomenon}} that the coagulation-water is remained in <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> <b>The</b> coagulation-water not only will diminish the dimension of <b>the</b> compress-air <b>bottle</b> but also bring chemical reaction to affect the whole intensity, resistance to pressure and life of <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> A new opinion is brought forward about using gas status equation to compute coagulation-water <b>the</b> compress-air <b>bottle,</b> we can gain {{a master of the}} volume of coagulation-water and improve the accuracy of measuring.

25|$|Waldeck {{had made}} a treaty to support Great Britain in London on 20 April 1776. Prince Friedrich Karl August of Waldeck kept three regiments ready for paid foreign service. The first of these regiments, with 684 {{officers}} and men, sailed from Portsmouth in July 1776 and participated in the New York campaign. During the campaign the Waldeck regiment captured wine and spirits belonging to American General Lee and were embittered towards the British General Howe when he made them empty <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> by the roadside.|$|E
25|$|The witch bottle was {{believed}} to be active as long as the bottle remained hidden and unbroken. People did go through a lot of trouble in hiding their witch bottles– those buried underneath fireplaces have been found only after the rest of the building has been torn down or otherwise disappeared.
