2500|$|In 1999, Buchanan was {{approached}} <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> the Ritz-Carlton condo-hotel development in Sarasota. Buchanan was {{cut out of}} the project. The developers, Robert Buford and Kevin Daves, said he lied about his financial means. Buchanan sued and the parties settled in 2001. Per a structured settlement, Buchanan bought a condo from a nephew of Buford's for $5 million; the nephew had purchased it the day before for $2.368 million. Buchanan owned the unit {{a little more than a}} year and then sold it to another member of Buford's family for $6.35 million. [...] The arrangement resulted in Buchanan paying taxes on his gain at the reduced long-term capital gains rate. Buford benefited from the apartment's increased appraised value and the use of Buchanan's $5 million. In the year he owned the penthouse, Buchanan used it for charity fundraisers.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} written in two parts. The first part {{contains}} {{an examination of the}} household functionings as an institution. Although the household was an establishment of declining national importance in the years 1360 - 1377, {{due to the fact that}} Edward III was increasingly separated from it and thus it lost much of its political significance, nevertheless his subjects were on the whole satisfied with the way in which the king ran his household. What complaints there were about its activities were not generalised condemnations but specific complaints aimed at either the jurisdictional competence of the court of the [indecipherable] or the way in which the kings purveyors abused their positions. The numbers of household staff declined steadily during this period, from over 550 in 1359 - 60 to less than 350 in 1377, the most radical drop being in the early 1360 s and probably being due to the fact that the household was no longer involved in the war. Despite the merger of the King’s and Queen’s households in 1360, wardrobe turnover was much reduced by this drop in numbers and by the household's non-involvement in the war; moreover real attempts at economy were made in the household throughout this period. The chamber too had its official income reduced but in actuality its unofficial income probably made it a vary wealthy department in the 1360 s although after 1369 most of its wealth was ploughed into the exchequer, by now very much a controlling organ of the national finances, <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> the renewed French war. The second part of the thesis examines the part which the royal domestic establishments played in the political upheavals of 1376 - 77. The Good parliament was not an attack on a system of government, still less an attack on the household. It was a highly personalised attack on a group of courtiers and their associates who had come increasingly to dominate both the kings policies and his patronage in the 1360 s and 1370 s. Yet with notable exceptions these courtiers were much more than mere idle royal favourites; the commons in the Good Parliament were quick to forget the services which men such as William Latinor, John Yovill and Richard Lyons had done to the state, and while it is true that these men had personally benefitted considerably from their association with the court, nevertheless the charges brought against them in the Good Parliament were in many cases most unfair. Finally, the part played by the lords in the events of 1376 - 77 in investigated and it is argued that although there was some opposition from the prelates to the government (now virtually ran by John of Gaunt although this was far from being the case before 1376), there really is very little evidence to suggest that the lay magnates either led the opposition in the Good Parliament or seriously opposed government policies in the last year of the reign...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With the Process of {{urbanization}} is accelerated unceasingly, {{more and more}} people are centralizing to city. This means that the needs of urban infrastructure are increasing. But the traditional mode of <b>financing</b> is hard <b>to</b> meet the demands of construction funds, especially, the non-profit and quasi-profit municipal infrastructure. Analyzing and studying on the financing mode of western developed countries, this paper targeted and optimized the financing structure of city municipal infrastructure construction based on the item division theory, and looked forward <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> solve <b>financing</b> problems of municipal infrastructure construction in China...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a moral hazard model to {{illustrate}} a credit crunch scenario. A firm is denied the access to bank funding due to high informational or monitoring costs that the bank must pay to induce the firm to behave. This is likely to happen in periods of recession, when trust between economic actors is limited. We then examine the activity carried out by the European Investment Bank Group (EIBG), with special attention to the provision of (1) credit lines <b>to</b> banks <b>to</b> <b>help</b> them <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and (2) guarantees for portfolios of SMEs' loans. We show that such services are extremely helpful to overcome the credit crunch as they mitigate the moral hazard problem without resorting to informational or monitoring expenses. ...|$|R

It was wheels-up on this commemorative round-the-world flight on June 9 when she took off from Oakland flying east on their journey. Pellegreno and her team followed the same route Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan followed in 1937, but for better re-fueling connections landed at differing airports.

40|$|To prevent {{investment}} {{growth in}} 2013 to 2015 from decreasing, the Industrial Ministry provided fiscal incentives to stimulate investment-growth. Nevertheless, the investment growth of manufacturing firms still declined. This condition indicated that fiscal stimulus might be ineffective to prevent investment-growth from declining. The decline of investment might {{be influenced by}} the increase of firm financial constraints to access a source of long term debts. This study aimed to examine the influence of financial constraints in moderating the effect of financing decisions from internal financing sources on investment. The population of the study was all listed-manufacturing firms in Indonesia from 2013 to 2015. Samples were chosen based on the availability of firms’ financial report covering the period of the study. The study concluded that financial constraints significantly weaken the effect of internal funding decision on investment. Unconstrained firms had a higher beta than constrained firms. Although unconstrained firms had an opportunity to choose their source of funding, they preferred <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> their investment from cash flows because the cost of debts might be much higher than the cost of equity. Hence, <b>to</b> <b>help</b> firms <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> their feasible investment opportunity, the government should not only provide tax incentives but also provide a low-interest loan...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} a {{broad range}} of opportunities for addressing the pressing human development needs of low-income countries by using new oil, gas, and mineral discoveries. It assesses how much of an impact can be made on the funding gaps for health and education by new oil and gas revenues, and what other uses of those revenues are likely to arise. The paper argues that there is a strong case for investing natural resources revenues in social sectors, as they provide an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> close the <b>financing</b> gaps in the African countries examined. However, the paper also highlights that the political economy risks of this revenue stream are higher than for other types of revenues. Finally, it illustrates how a simple diagnostic framework can be used <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> guide social sector investment decisions in the light of new natural resources revenues...|$|R

50|$|Robert was of {{pronounced}} Puritan sympathies. During the 1630s, with Parliament in abeyance, he promoted emigration <b>to</b> America, <b>helping</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> the Saybrook Colony. When {{civil war}} broke out in 1642, {{it was inevitable that}} he would join the parliamentary army. As a man of considerable organisational ability, he soon emerged as a commanding figure in central England, where loyalties were divided and {{the course of the war}} was determined by a patchwork of sieges and skirmishes. After a series of victories in Warwickshire in 1643, he moved his forces to Lichfield, where a royalist force had holed up in the Cathedral. There, while directing his troops, a bullet cut him down. However, the succession to the manor was secure. Robert Greville was succeeded by Francis Greville, 3rd Baron Brooke, and Penkridge manor remained with the Grevilles and their Brooke Barony for another century.Despite apparent Puritan sympathies, the Littletons found themselves on the Royalist side. Sir Edward Littleton had been made a baronet by Charles I on 28 June 1627, albeit in exchange for a large sum of money acquired through marriage to Hester Courten, daughter of Sir William Courten, an immensely wealthy London textile merchant and financier. He inherited the estates from his father in 1629 and remained faithful to the king throughout the troubles of the 1630s and 1640s. He was Member of Parliament for Staffordshire from 1640 but was expelled from the House of Commons in 1644. In May 1645, royalist troops were quartered in the village, presumably because of Littleton's known royalist sympathies. A small parliamentary force expelled the royalist soldiers after a brief skirmish. Littleton's estates were subject to sequestration but, like most minor royalist sympathisers, he was able to recover them on payment of a substantial sum: £1347. The family holdings were thus preserved and the family found themselves in favour again after the restoration of Charles II in 1660.|$|R
50|$|It {{was this}} {{spot where the}} Alliance of Religions and Conservation, at the {{initiative}} of the local Taoist community and co-funded by the Ecological Management Foundation, built the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple for the worship of the three gods of Mount Taibai and an Ecology Education Center <b>to</b> <b>help</b> stimulating what had been such {{an important part of}} Taoism since ancient times, namely preserving the natural environment. In 2004, the World Wildlife Fund appealed to the Alliance of Religions and Conservation for <b>help</b> because they wanted <b>to</b> build an eco-resort on Mount Taibai and had discovered the seven rooms {{at the site of the}} old Tiejiashu Temple. Earlier, the World Wildlife Fund had already built a number of panda sanctuaries to protect the environment of the Qinling panda. The eco-resort was now supposed to start generating income as a means of financing those sanctuaries. The World Wildlife Fund asked the Alliance of Religions and Conservation to investigate. The Alliance of Religions and Conservation’s secretary-general Martin Palmer met the vice-abbot of the Louguan Tai Temple, Master Ren Xingzhi. Both quickly saw the opportunities for a fruitful and sustainable partnership. These meetings gave rise to the plans for a Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple with an Ecology Education Center next <b>to</b> it. <b>To</b> <b>help</b> <b>finance</b> the execution of the plans, an appeal was made to Allerd Stikker, founder and chairman of Ecological Management Foundation. Since the inauguration in 2007, the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple with the Ecology Education Center have been the epicenter of an effort to make China’s Taoist temples more sustainable and to create an awareness of sustainability issues.|$|R
