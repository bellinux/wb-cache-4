5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This lower limit is around 1.93 times the mass of Jupiter. The true mass depends on the inclination of the orbit, which in general is unknown. However, because Gliese 876 is only 15 light years from Earth Benedict et al. (2002) were able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope to detect the astrometric wobble created by Gliese 876 b. This constituted the first unambiguous astrometric detection of an extrasolar planet. Their analysis suggested that the orbital inclination is 84°±6° (close to edge-on). In the case of Gliese 876 b, modelling the planet-planet interactions from the Laplace resonance shows that the actual inclination of the orbit is 59°, resulting in a true mass of 2.2756 times the mass of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Once a room is {{cleared of}} monsters, {{it will remain}} clear, {{allowing}} the player to re-trace {{their way through the}} level, though once they move onto the next level, they cannot return. Along the way, the player can collect money to buy power-ups from shopkeepers, keys to unlock special treasure rooms, and new weapons and power-ups to strengthen their chances against the enemies. The player's health is tracked by a number of hearts; if the character loses all their hearts, the game ends in permadeath and the player must start over from a freshly-generated dungeon. Each floor of the dungeon includes a boss which the player must defeat before continuing to the next level. On the sixth of eight floors, the player fights Isaac's mother; after defeating her, Isaac crawls into her womb. Later levels are significantly harder, culminating in a fight against the heart of Isaac's mother on the eighth floor. An optional ninth floor, Sheol contains the boss Satan. Winning the game with certain characters or by certain conditions unlocks new power-ups that might appear in the dungeon or the ability <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the other characters. The game tracks the various power-ups that the player has found over time which can be reviewed from the game's menus.|$|E

25|$|Typical {{computer}} systems today use hardware-enforced rules about what programs {{are allowed to}} access what data. The processor monitors the execution and stops a program that violates a rule (e.g., a user process that is about to read or write to kernel memory, and so on). In systems that lack support for capabilities, processes are isolated from each other by using separate address spaces. Calls from user processes into the kernel are regulated by requiring them <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the above-described system call methods.|$|E

The school survived the war, pupil numbers increased again, and the school became well known throughout Wales and the Midlands.

25|$|Jämtland's first seal {{was the one}} {{depicted}} above {{from the}} medieval period. It was abolished after the Nordic Seven Years' War and the second seal of Jämtland was used between 1575-1614. This seal contained two Olav-axes and was also abolished after a Swedish occupation, the one during the Kalmar War. When Jämtland became Swedish it was not suitable <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the older seals with such a strong Norwegian influence {{as a basis for}} a new Swedish coat of arms.

25|$|The CIA's {{response}} was another distraction. To begin Operation Moonmark, the CIA {{arranged for the}} U.S. Air Force <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its C-130 Hercules to drop a BLU-82 bomb to blast a helicopter landing zone (HLZ). Several helicopters flew in, a team dropped into the HLZ long enough to scatter cigarette butts, old packing crates, and litter about to simulate an insertion, then were pulled out by the helicopters. For the next week, Air America Twin Otters overflew the phony HLZ dropping bogus parachutes and broadcasting helicopter racket. Thus the 15,000 lb (6,800 kilo) bomb served as a second diversion to the diversion.|$|E

25|$|The Fairtrade {{certification}} system covers a growing range of products, including bananas, honey, coffee, oranges, Cocoa bean, cocoa, cotton, dried and {{fresh fruits and}} vegetables, juices, nuts and oil seeds, quinoa, rice, spices, sugar, tea, and wine. Companies offering products that meet the Fairtrade standards may apply for licences <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Fairtrade Certification Marks for those products. The International Fairtrade Certification Mark was launched in 2002 by FLO, and replaced twelve Marks used by various Fairtrade labelling initiatives. The new Certification Mark is currently used worldwide (with {{the exception of the}} United States). The Fair Trade Certified Mark is still used to identify Fairtrade goods in the United States.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to HTTP proxies is <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{a number of}} add-ons and plug-ins for browsers, thereby avoiding {{the conversion of the}} DOIs to URLs, which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink. For example. the , enables the browser to access Handle System handles or DOIs like hdl:4263537/4000 or doi:10.1000/1 directly in the Firefox browser, using the native Handle System protocol. This plug-in can also replace references to web-to-handle proxy servers with native resolution. A disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that, at least at present, most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser, mail reader, or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed.|$|E
25|$|Lee made six out {{of eleven}} PGA Tour cuts after turning pro, with two top-25 finishes. He tied for 13th at the HP Byron Nelson Championship in May, and {{improved}} on his best finish in a PGA Tour event by finishing in a tie for 7th at the AT National in July. That top ten finish earned Lee {{a spot in the}} following week's John Deere Classic, meaning he did not have <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his two remaining sponsor exemptions. The money from his T-7 finish put him $187,904 away from earning temporary status on tour. Lee missed the cut by two strokes at the John Deere Classic after bogeying the last two holes of his second round. Lee missed the cut again three weeks later at the Buick Open.|$|E

25|$|Until 2014, Delta served Love Field by subleasing use of American's gates. After being {{notified}} that {{it would}} have to cease service at Love, Delta threatened to sue the city of Dallas. Southwest agreed to a temporary resolution of the situation by agreeing to sublease gate space to Delta until January 2015. When this agreement expired, United Airlines agreed to allow Delta <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its gates until July 2015. United had previously agreed to transfer its gate rights to Southwest. The city of Dallas brought a lawsuit in federal court in June 2015 in order to resolve Delta's claims. In January 2016, Delta won a preliminary injunction to continue service at Love Field using Southwest gate rights, based on federal aviation law and DOT competition policies. As of June 2016, the injunction is being appealed at the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.|$|E
25|$|While {{this meant}} that Redden (along with Scott Gomez of the Montreal Canadiens, {{who was in a}} similar situation) would still have been paid his {{prorated}} 2012–13 salary despite not playing, the NHL Players' Association (NHLPA) was concerned that for Redden and Gomez to be forced to spend an entire year away from hockey would adversely affect their ability to find employment elsewhere in the NHL during the 2013 off-season, even at a much reduced salary. On January 15, in order to avoid this process, the CBA was revised to allow teams <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their two compliance buyouts {{prior to the start of}} the shortened 2012–13 season, with the provision that the players bought-out in such a way would still be paid their prorated but otherwise full 2012–13 salaries (which would still count against the 2012–13 cap), and with the buyout of the subsequent years otherwise proceeding as originally intended.|$|E
25|$|In a few cases, a {{national}} telecommunication agency may also allow hams to use frequencies {{outside of the}} internationally allocated amateur radio bands.
