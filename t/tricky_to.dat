5|$|Peyton {{has noted}} that the {{distinct}} personalities of the series' characters meant that he considered some of them {{much more difficult to}} convincingly write for than others. He found Cooper to be particularly <b>tricky</b> <b>to</b> write for, as the character had an idiosyncratic view of the world which needed to be maintained; but found Audrey Horne to be his favourite to work on as he considered the character—and actress Sherilyn Fenn—to be both sexy and smart, and to have developed substantially as the series progressed. The character of Madeline Ferguson was named for characters in Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo—Kim Novak's Madeleine Elster and James Stewart's Scottie Ferguson. Ferguson's cousin, the murdered schoolgirl Laura Palmer, was similarly named after the titular character in Otto Preminger's 1944 film Laura; while other characters in the series would also be named for film noir characters.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} pre-production aircraft, designated Dr.I, {{were delivered}} to Jasta 11. Idflieg issued a production order for 100 triplanes in September, {{followed by an}} order for 200 in November. Apart from the straight {{leading edge of the}} tailplane, these aircraft were almost identical to the F.I. The primary distinguishing feature was the addition of wingtip skids, which proved necessary because the aircraft was <b>tricky</b> <b>to</b> land and prone to ground looping. In October, Fokker began delivering the Dr.I to squadrons within Richthofen's Jagdgeschwader I.|$|E
25|$|The {{fermentation}} {{processes to}} produce propanol and butanol from cellulose are fairly <b>tricky</b> <b>to</b> execute, and the Weizmann organism (Clostridium acetobutylicum) currently used to perform these conversions produces an extremely unpleasant smell, and {{this must be}} taken into consideration when designing and locating a fermentation plant. This organism also dies when the butanol content of whatever it is fermenting rises to 7%. For comparison, yeast dies when the ethanol content of its feedstock hits 14%. Specialized strains can tolerate even greater ethanol concentrations - so-called turbo yeast can withstand up to 16% ethanol.|$|E

This speech, which has been widely referred to, has been a factor in the widespread belief that Moctezuma was addressing Cortés as the returning god Quetzalcoatl.|$|E

25|$|Besides the quirks the English {{spelling}} {{system has}} inherited from its past, {{there are other}} idiosyncrasies in spelling that make it <b>tricky</b> <b>to</b> learn. English contains, depending on dialect, 24–27 separate consonant phonemes and 13–20 vowels. However, there are only 26 letters in the modern English alphabet, so {{there is not a}} one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds. Many sounds are spelled using different letters or multiple letters, and for those words whose pronunciation is predictable from the spelling, the sounds denoted by the letters depend on the surrounding letters. For example, the digraph th represents two different sounds (the voiced dental fricative and the voiceless dental fricative) (see Pronunciation of English th), and the voiceless alveolar sibilant can be represented by the letters s and c.|$|E
25|$|A quickfire 30 from captain Habibul Bashar {{helped to}} take {{away some of the}} jitters, as Bashar took 16 runs off a Brett Lee over, but a bouncer from Shane Watson wasn't {{successfully}} evaded, and Adam Gilchrist could take the catch. Aftab Ahmed had to settle for 7, and it was down to the last two recognised batsmen – Shahriar Nafees, who had quietly moved his way to 25 not out, and wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud. However, the two put on an almost faultless partnership of 94, taking their time to consolidate. Shahriar eventually departed for 75, edging a short ball from Shane Watson to the wicket-keeper – the usual method of dismissal. However, their partnership had given Bangladesh hope, and Mohammad Rafique took advantage with a six off Watson. Despite two more wickets falling – Rafique and Khaled Mahmud (caught at mid-on on the last ball) – Bangladesh had recovered to 250 for 8, which could potentially be <b>tricky</b> <b>to</b> chase.|$|E
25|$|Before Europeans arrived, Māori either walked or used {{watercraft}} on rivers {{or along}} the coasts. The road network of New Zealand has {{its origins in}} these tracks and paths used by Māori and later by Europeans in their early travels through New Zealand. Several major Māori tracks were known, such as the western coastal track was used along the whole length of the North Island, and the track on the East Coast, which left the coast near Castlepoint and rejoined it near Napier. In the South Island, another major track existed down the east coast with tributary tracks following streams up to the mountain passes to the West Coast. Mountains, swamp, and dense bush made inland routes <b>tricky</b> <b>to</b> traverse, and early settlers also made use of beaches as roads, for walking, riding horses, and herding sheep. Many farms had access via beaches only, and beaches were used as runways for planes. Some beaches are still used by planes, for example at Okarito and {{on the west coast}} of Stewart Island.|$|E

25|$|Passive {{crossovers}} {{are commonly}} installed inside speaker boxes and {{are by far}} the most usual type of crossover for home and low-power use. In car audio systems, passive crossovers may be in a separate box, necessary to accommodate the size of the components used. Passive crossovers may be simple for low-order filtering, or complex to allow steep slopes such as 18 or 24dB per octave. Passive crossovers can also be designed to compensate for undesired characteristics of driver, horn, or enclosure resonances, and can be <b>tricky</b> <b>to</b> implement, due to component interaction. Passive crossovers, like the driver units that they feed, have power handling limits, have insertion losses (10% is often claimed), and change the load seen by the amplifier. The changes are matters of concern for many in the hi-fi world. When high output levels are required, active crossovers may be preferable. Active crossovers may be simple circuits that emulate the response of a passive network, or may be more complex, allowing extensive audio adjustments. Some active crossovers, usually digital loudspeaker management systems, may include electronics and controls for precise alignment of phase and time between frequency bands, equalization, dynamic range compression and limiting) control.|$|E

500|$|Björk {{continued}} to compose {{songs such as}} [...] "Isobel", which was created while she was visiting Reykjavík for Christmas, before bringing it back to Hooper's studio.

500|$|Peter Westen and H. L. A. Hart {{argue that}} throffers {{are not always}} coercive, and, when they are, it is {{specifically}} the threat that makes them so. For a throffer to be coercive, they claim, the threat must meet three further conditions; firstly, the person making the throffer [...] "must be intentionally bringing the threat to bear on X in order that X do something, Z1", secondly, the person making the throffer must know that [...] "X would not otherwise do or wish to be constrained to do" [...] Z1, and, thirdly, the threat part of the throffer must render [...] "X's option of doing Z1 more eligible in X's eyes than it would otherwise be". As such, for the authors, {{there is the possibility}} of non-coercive throffers. The pair present three possible examples. Firstly, when the threat aspect of the throffer is a joke; secondly, when the offer aspect is already so desirable to the subject that the threat does not affect their decision-making; or, thirdly, when the subject mistakenly believes the threat immaterial because of the attractiveness of the offer. Rhodes similarly concludes that if a throffer is coercive, it is because of the threatening aspect. For him, the question is [...] "whether one regards the threat component of a throffer as both a necessary and sufficient condition of the performance of a behaviour". He argues that if the offer without the threat would have been enough for the agent subject to the proposal to act, then the proposal is not coercive. However, if both offer and threat aspects of the throffer are motivating factors, then it is <b>tricky</b> <b>to</b> determine whether the agent subject to the proposal was coerced. He suggests that differentiating between [...] "pure coercion" [...] and [...] "partial coercion" [...] may help solve this problem, and that the question of coercion in these cases is one of degree.|$|E
