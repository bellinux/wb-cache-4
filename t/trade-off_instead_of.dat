40|$|Framing {{sustainable}} intensification as {{a wicked}} problem reveals how inherent trade-offs and resulting uncertainty and ambiguity block integrated problem solving as promoted by sustainable chain management approaches to production and consumption. The fragmented institutional set-up of the chains avoids that individual actors {{take responsibility for}} risks they helped to produce, resulting in ‘organized irresponsibility’. Governance arrangements for sustainable chain management focus especially on reducing risk and uncertainty and ignore <b>trade-offs</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> acknowledging them. For the Dutch chicken meat chain, this article explores how wicked problems and organized irresponsibility influence governance opportunities for sustainable intensification...|$|R
30|$|Multi-objective {{optimization}} problems (MOPs) {{refer to}} those consisting of multiple contradictory objectives to be optimized simultaneously, which widely exist in real-world applications [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. MOPs {{with more than}} three objectives are also called many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) [6]. Due {{to the fact that}} the objectives are in conflict with each other, there usually exists a set <b>of</b> <b>trade-off</b> solutions <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> one single optimal solution for an MOP. In the past 2 decades, evolutionary algorithms have demonstrated the superiority in solving MOPs, and a large number of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been developed, such as NSGA-II [7], SPEA 2 [8], PESA-II [9], IBEA [10], and MOEA/D [11].|$|R

40|$|In {{engineering}} design, {{information regarding}} the uncertain variables or parameters is usually {{in the form of}} finite samples. Existing methods in optimal design under uncertainty cannot handle this form of incomplete information; they have to either discard some valuable information or postulate existence of additional information. In this article, we present a reliability-based optimization method that is applicable when information of the uncertain variables or parameters {{is in the form of}} both finite samples and probability distributions. The method adopts a Bayesian binomial inference technique to estimate reliability, and uses this estimate to maximize the confidence that the design will meet or exceed a target reliability. The method produces a set <b>of</b> Pareto <b>trade-off</b> designs <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> a single design, reflecting the levels of confidence about a design’s reliability given certain incomplete information. As a demonstration, we apply the method to design an optimal piston-ring/cylinder-liner assembly under surface roughness uncertainty. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 2204969...|$|R
40|$|Assuming ‘ceteris paribus’ {{in terms}} of the {{viability}} of the planet during the coming half-century or so, the rising needs of a burgeoning, but also increasingly rich and demanding world population will drastically change agriculture. Crop yields and animal productivity will have to increase substantially, with the risk of further depleting the resource base and degrading the environment, making food production both the culprit and the victim. Future food security therefore depends on development of technologies that increase the efficiency of resource use and prevent externalization of costs. The current trend is towards intensification, especially more output per production unit so as to increase input efficiency. Whether that trend is sustainable is a matter of strong debate among scientists and policy-makers alike. The big question is how to produce more food with much fewer resources. Sustainable intensification (i. e., increasing agricultural output while keeping the ecological footprint as small as possible) for some is an oxymoron, unless real progress can be made in ecological intensification, that is, increasing agricultural output by capitalizing on ecological processes in agro-ecosystems. Definitions of intensification and sustainability vary greatly. The way these concepts are being used in different disciplines causes tensions and hides <b>trade-offs</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> making them explicit. Inter-disciplinarity and boundary-crossing in terminology and concepts are needed. Implicitly, the operationalization of intensification and sustainability implies appreciation of and choices for values, an issue that is often overlooked and sometimes even denied in the natural sciences. The multidimensional nature of intensification needs to be linked to the various notions of sustainability, acknowledging a hierarchy of considerations underlying decision-making on trade-offs, thus allowing political and moral arguments to play a proper role in the strategy towards sustainable intensification. We make a plea to create clarity in assumptions, norms and values in that decision-making process. Acknowledging that win-win situations are rare and that (some) choices have to be made on non-scientific grounds makes the debate more transparent and its outcome more acceptable both to the scientific community and society at large...|$|R
40|$|Computational {{models are}} of {{increasing}} complexity and their behavior may in particular {{emerge from the}} interaction of different parts. Studying such models becomes then {{more and more difficult}} and {{there is a need for}} methods and tools supporting this process. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms generate a set <b>of</b> <b>trade-off</b> solutions <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> a single optimal solution. The availability of a set of solutions that have the specificity to be optimal relative to carefully chosen objectives allows to perform data mining in order to better understand model features and regularities. We review the corresponding work, propose a unifying framework, and highlight its potential use. Typical questions that such a methodology allows to address are the following: what are the most critical parameters of the model? What are the relations between the parameters and the objectives? What are the typical behaviors of the model? Two examples are provided to illustrate the capabilities of the methodology. The features of a flapping-wing robot are thus evaluated to find out its speed-energy relation, together with the criticality of its parameters. A neurocomputational model of the Basal Ganglia brain nuclei is then considered and its most salient features according to this methodology are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{information}} retrieval systems, users often have difficulties in forming precise queries {{to express their}} information need. One approach to express information need is to explore the information space by providing relevance feedback to recommended items. This feedback is then used to model user search intent. Studies have shown how retrieval performance could be improved by allowing users to give feedback to multiple items such as keywords and documents <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> keywords only. In this thesis, I extend an existing user model which uses document-level and keyword-level feedback to include session-level feedback, and study the usefulness of this extension. By conducting simulation studies in various settings, I investigate the effect of session-level feedback. Based on these simulation results, I conclude that additional session-feedback helps in finding relevant documents by improving F 1 -score. Results show that more the additional session-feedback, more the improvement in F 1 -score. However, <b>trade-off</b> <b>of</b> session-feedback <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> document and keyword feedback results in drop in document F 1 -score, therefore indicating that session-feedback is less informative than document and keyword feedback...|$|R
40|$|Born only a {{few decades}} ago, the video game {{industry}} has now surpassed the revenue of the movie business and {{shows no sign of}} decline in its expansion rate. In addition to the large number of exclusively online titles operating today, most regular recent game also provide a networked multiplayer mode. Despite their success, the online experience of online games is extremely sensitive to network conditions. Network games are realtime and highly interactive. For these reasons they are more affected by the imperfections of the telecommunication network than most other Internet applications. In particular, geographical distances introduce unavoidable delays which degrades the experience of players. This objective of this thesis is to models the impact of network imperfections on game playability and propose novel solutions {{to improve the quality of}} experience of participants in online games. There is no consistent analysis across different game research groups on how network delays affect game users. In order to understand the impacts of network delays on game quality, we introduce a generic framework which can analyse the propagation of network disturbances in a game as a three steps process. First, measurable inconsistencies are derived from the game 2 ̆ 7 s network topology and synchronisation scheme. Next, we determine the violations of the ideal laws of the virtual environment generated by these inconsistencies. Finally, the perceptual impact of these violations on players is estimated using fuzzy logic utility functions. Game quality metrics proposed in the literature either suit a particular setup or do not capture every aspects of the players 2 ̆ 7 experience. Using our framework, we introduce a measurable and objective definition of network playability as the collection of all inconsistencies endured by a player. As fairness is a function of the relative playability amongst game users, we define the network unfairness of a game as the variation coefficient of the participants 2 ̆ 7 playability and validate this definition in an experimental setup. The thesis also investigates the potential to trade-off different aspects of the playability of participants through the alteration of (the) game synchronisation. We demonstrate that absolutely conservative and fully optimistic synchronisation schemes are the extremes of a continuum of possible strategies. Using a specialised game simulator, we search and find the optimum synchronisation parameters within this continuum <b>of</b> <b>trade-offs.</b> <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> using the same synchronisation for all actions, a second improvement consists of tuning the synchronisation parameters used for different actions independently and according to the specific requirements of each action type. After studying and proposing enhancements to the synchronisation scheme of online games, this thesis formulates an integer programming problem aiming at optimising the selection of game servers in a cloud of potential sites. We introduce the notion of critical inconsistency and demonstrate that optimising this criteria tends to improve both playability and fairness. Finally, the resolution of small instances of this problem lead to the development of a recursive heuristic capable of converging towards a near-optimum set of servers providing best network conditions for the players of an online game. Simulations shows the gap between our heuristic solutions and a calculable lower bound average 5. 19...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the system architecture development process {{in an international}} ICT company, which is building a comprehensive e-business system for its customers. The implementation includes the integration of data and legacy systems from independent business units {{and the construction of}} a uniform web-based customer interface. The research focuses on the creation of ebusiness system architecture and observes that the architecture is not completely designed through rational decisions and <b>trade-offs.</b> <b>Instead,</b> it emerges through somewhat non-deliberate actions obliged by the situation and its constraints, conflicts, compromises, and political decisions. The interview-based qualitative data is analyzed using grounded theory and a general explanation model for the creation of e-business system architecture is introduced. The role of technical system architecture in ebusiness systems development is clarified and e-business specific requirements for development methods are listed and compared to the support provided by UML and RUP. 1...|$|R
