5|$|Warshaw {{used those}} days {{to design the}} {{structure}} of the game and segmented the concept into four ideas: world, objective, path to achieve the objective, and obstacles. He envisioned a three-dimensional cube world as the setting and adapted part of the film's plot, E.T. phoning home, as the goal. Warshaw then conceived that E.T. would need to assemble a special phone to call his ship and arrive at a special landing site to achieve this goal. He considered obstacles as an element that would determine the success of a game, and experienced difficulties when taking into account the time constraints and technical limitations of the console. Inspired by the movie, adults were implemented as antagonists that would chase the alien. Feeling more adversity was needed, Warshaw included a time limit for players to accomplish the goal. Pits were devised as an element to hide the pieces of <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> well as expand the game's world.|$|E

40|$|This study, {{carried out}} among 1397 Flemish high school pupils, {{examines}} whether adolescents’ experience {{of success and}} failure in the school system is related to their use of <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> a status object. In line with Bourdieu’s cultural capital theory, a conformity, compensation and resistance hypothesis are formulated. The results confirm the conformity hypothesis: conform to the social image that the school system bestows on them, and independent from their social class background, adolescents in academic tracks were less likely to use <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> a status object. The compensation hypothesis was partially confirmed: adolescents who lag behind in combination with a drop to a non-academic school track, and adolescents with a negative academic self-concept were more likely to use <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> a status object, but no direct relationship was found with lagging behind. The resistance hypothesis was fully supported: a negative attitude towards school mediates the relationship between lagging behind, school track, academic self-concept and the use of <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> a status object. Finally, self-esteem was found to relate positively to the use of <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> a status object, which suggests that adolescents who use <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> a status object have achieved a successful identity in other domains than the academic domain. Gender and age were found to moderate some of the relationships found. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|The Cryptophon {{is built}} on the {{foundation}} of an 8051 compatible microprocessor which controls the whole system and peripherals (e.g. ISDN controller, keypad and display). For the cryptography, Floricic used cheap DSPs from Texas Instruments which he scrapped out of old computer modems, but which could also be bought at affordable prices. As this type of DSP is not powerful enough for the cryptography algorithm chosen, Floricic used two of them for the Cryptophon – one for sending and one for receiving. He planned to extend the phone so {{it would also be}} possible to encrypt data-connections. Floricic developed both the operating software of <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> well as the cryptography implementation in the DSPs. He found a new way to implement IDEA to save significant processing time.|$|E

40|$|Based on Bourdieu’s Cultural Capital theory this study, {{carried out}} among 1899 Flemish {{secondary}} school pupils, examines (1) whether adolescents’ experiences at school predict their attitude towards <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> a status object, and (2) whether these attitudes in turn predict {{ownership of a}} high-status phone. Three concurrent hypotheses were tested. Our ‘conformity hypothesis’, was supported: {{in line with the}} social image that the school system bestows on them, adolescents in non-academic tracks attach greater importance to having a ‘cool’ mobile phone and lagging behind indirectly predicted this attitude via school track. The ‘compensation hypothesis’ was not supported: no direct relationship was found between academic self-concept or lagging behind and adolescents’ attitude towards <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> a status object. The ‘resistance hypothesis’ was supported: adolescents with lower academic self-concept, who have lagged behind and who are in a semi-academic or vocational school track have a more negative attitude towards school, which in turn predicts a more positive attitude towards <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> a status object. Finally, attitude towards <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> a status object strongly predicts ownership of a high-status mobile phone.
