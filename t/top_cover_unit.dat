40|$|Abstract- Gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> {{is a vital}} {{component}} of horizontally split integrally geared centrifugal compressor. Reliability of <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> {{is directly related to}} the structural rigidity and structural integrity of compressor. Assuming that the <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> is designed within the mechanical limits of its construction material, one of the most common causes of <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> failure is resonance. The aim of the designer while designing <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> is to have minimum weight and still have sufficient rigidity to avoid resonance. It is imperative; however, that rigorous engineering analysis is applied in the initial design phase to prevent resonance that will result in failure of gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover.</b> To meet the objectives of designing a reliable integrally geared centrifugal compressor, gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> modal analysis is of utmost importance. Numerical modal analysis, usually based on Finite Element Method, is commonly used to determine the vibration characteristics, such as natural frequencies and the associated mode shapes of a structure. This paper addresses finite element analysis and modal testing of gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> of an integrally geared centrifugal compressor. The goal is to determine, verify and validate the vibration characteristics of the gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> using both analytical and experimental techniques. The 3 -D solid model of the gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> was built using Autodesk Inventor®. ANSYS workbench 13 ® was used for preprocessing, solving and post processing. Modal analysis involved extraction of mode shapes and natural frequencies. Impact testing using hammer excitation was used to experimentally determine the vibration properties of the gearbox to...|$|R
40|$|The report compiles {{existing}} {{information about}} materials used for designing a <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> construction pursuant to Landfill Directive 1999 / 31 /EC. The report includes a short review of existing requirements on top liners, {{especially in the}} Nordic countries. Accepting waste materials in <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> requires reliable information of both the technical and environmental properties. Important properties of waste material are listed, and factors {{to be considered in}} evaluating the functionality of the whole <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> construction are discussed. Key points in the evaluation of the suitability of waste materials in <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> are: the waste material fulfils the quality requirements and functions of the whole construction the quality variations of key properties are known and acceptable the long-term behaviour of the waste material is evaluated through pilot studies and proved reliable. This report describes the characteristics of the most typical waste materials used for designing <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> constructions. Moreover, a summary of Nordic studies on potential waste materials for <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> has been collated...|$|R
50|$|Other {{changes were}} implemented, some during the war, {{but not all}} M1917s {{received}} these updates. Beginning in 1938, the pivot in the <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> was replaced with a new one that would become standard on all M1919 series guns. While the World War I pattern <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> hinge pin {{appears to have been}} retained on most converted M1917s, the later production M1917A1s had a positive locking <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> hinge pin that allowed the <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> to remain open lessening the chance of it dropping closed on one's hands while working on the gun—this became the standard on all M1919 series guns.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is {{concentrated}} on the experimental investigation of wear resistance of rubber powder modified rubber blends. Styrene-Butadiene-Rubber (SBR) blends applied for conveying belt <b>top</b> <b>covers</b> have been modified by ground rubber (rubber powder) based on SBR. We theoretically described the rubber wear mechanism due to loading conditions occurring at conveyor belts in the field, to simulate wear behavior of <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> rubber materials. An own developed testing equipment based on gravimetric determination of mass loss of rubber test specimen was used investigating dynamic wear with respect to fracture properties of <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> materials. Furthermore we investigated fatigue crack growth (FCG) data over a broad range of tearing energy by Tear Analyzer to characterize crack propagation behavior of rubber powder modified rubber blends. Thus, we demonstrate the influence of rubber powder on resistance against occurrence of fracture as well as dynamic wear {{as a function of the}} rubber powder content in rubber blends applied for conveying belt <b>top</b> <b>covers...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this project, {{the design}} of a {{fixation}} for engine <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> is done. This fixation is the union between a car engine and its <b>top</b> <b>cover.</b> Normally, an engine <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> has four connection points where the fixations that are the subject of this project appear. In the first main part of the project, an introduction to de subject is done, explaining the environment of an engine <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> and presenting the solution of the Autoneum Company where this project has been performed. The main parts of an engine <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> such as the different materials and processes. Also, a benchmark and an internet study has been done to discover the different solutions in the market and to find the best path to guide this project. Secondly, 11 different solutions have been designed and proposed as candidates to be developed as the final solutions. Each of them are presented in an understandable sketch and defined in a morphological box to ease the posterior evaluation of all them. Then an evaluation of all the candidates is presented recording the subjective but controlled opinion of the project manager and the project assistant. Then, once the final candidate has been selected, the performance of some tests help to evaluate the feasibility of the welded surface between the engine <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> and the fixation. The precise evaluation of the final candidate in terms of vibration and strength will be evaluated on the first prototypes. This tasks will stay apart of the project as once the candidate is selected, an external company is going to perfection the design and evaluate the performance {{due to the lack of}} experience of the company in this subject makes this part of the project expensive and inefficient...|$|R
