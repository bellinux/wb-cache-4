5|$|Andrew Carnegie, an {{immigrant}} from Scotland, a former Pennsylvania Railroad executive turned steel magnate, founded the Carnegie Steel Company. He proceeded {{to play a}} key role in the development of the U.S. steel industry. He became a philanthropist: in 1890, he established the first Carnegie Library, in a program to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds. In 1895, he founded the Carnegie Institute. In 1901, as the U.S. Steel Corporation formed, he sold his mills to J.P. Morgan for $250 million, making him one of the world's richest men. Carnegie once wrote <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> dies rich, dies disgraced. He devoted the rest of his life to public service, establishing libraries, trusts, and foundations. In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|While {{the general}} public were baffled <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> just scored a century against Australia could be {{left out of the}} team, the English cricketing press were divided on the decision. Some journalists {{supported}} the MCC on cricketing grounds, including the cricket correspondents of The Times and The Daily Telegraph. Others, prominently the former England captain Ted Dexter, the former Test player Trevor Bailey and E.W. Swanton, all of whom generally sided with the cricket establishment, contended that D'Oliveira deserved to be in the team on merit. Swanton said he had received no letters which actually agreed with the omission. Other commentators, such as the Worcestershire club secretary and the former West Indies Test player Learie Constantine, openly stated that D'Oliveira was omitted either because of his race or because the MCC supported apartheid. Some Labour politicians also expressed concern. John Arlott, while asserting that D'Oliveira deserved to be included, suggested that to demonstrate opposition to apartheid, the MCC should perhaps have selected him even if this were not the case. The general press took a wider view, with several newspaper columns reporting that the decision appeared to have been made to avoid offending the South African government. According to Williams, the public positions held by much of the MCC committee towards South Africa led to suspicions that D'Oliveira may have been left out simply to save the tour.|$|E

Scotland Yard spent several weeks investigating the claim. After the claim was made public in March 2006, the Menezes family denied the allegation and claimed that the Metropolitan Police were trying to smear Menezes.|$|E

The provision was held to be unconstitutional as while the age of consent for heterosexual couples is 16, male homosexual couples must reach 21 to have sex legally.|$|E

25|$|There {{were signs}} of gradual {{recovery}} in February 1993 when former commentator Eric Bischoff was appointed as Executive Vice President of WCW.

25|$|Laurence Hyde {{had some}} {{learning}} and {{a share of}} his father's literary genius. The main employment of his old age was the preparation for the press of his father's History of the Rebellion, to which he wrote a preface in which he expounded his Tory philosophy. The work was dedicated to his niece Queen Anne: the Queen, whose poor eyesight made reading something of an ordeal, was not especially pleased, particularly since the preface {{could be interpreted as}} an attack on her own policies. She remarked drily that it was strange <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> did not lack sense in other ways should be made ridiculous by his vanity.|$|E
25|$|The {{significance}} of Bai Bureh's {{war against the}} British {{is not a matter}} of whether he won or lost the war but <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had none of what could be called formal military training was able to show that for a significant number of months he was able to take on the British who were very proud of their great military successes across the globe. The British troops were led by officers trained at the finest military academies where war is studied in the same way that one studies a subject at university. The fact that Bai Bureh was not executed after his capture has led some historians to claim that this was in admiration for his prowess as an adversary to the British.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Samuel Maverick ever owned any other cattle and no other stock at all, beyond a few horses. One can reasonably doubt <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> was not in the cattle business and who did not work with or live near his herd would have been engaged in branding strays. The record suggests that it was nothing more than lack of interest in property he never wanted that led to his name becoming associated {{with one of the most}} enduring terms of the Old West and a natural subject for every manner of speculation and inventive tale. The accounts conveyed by other contributors have been left unaltered, to be taken, together with Mrs. Maverick's material, as illustrative of this phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur {{investigated}} {{the case in}} conjunction with police. Hecht's first clue was a police photograph of the two weapons used in the shooting. Both were virtually identical Colt M1911's. Hecht thought it odd <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> {{appeared to be a}} penniless vagrant—he had less than $5 on his person when found—would carry such an expensive weapon which was not widely available to the public at the time, instead of selling it. He also found {{it hard to believe that}} a mere drifter would risk a conflict with a veteran who was widely known to carry a gun. MacArthur came to a similar conclusion and came to find that the stranger's weapon had been sold to Wanderer's cousin Fred several years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{cardinals}} are bishops. Domenico Bartolucci, Karl Josef Becker, Roberto Tucci and Albert Vanhoye {{are examples}} of 21st-century non-bishop cardinals. The 1917 Code of Canon Law introduced the requirement that a cardinal {{must be at least}} a priest. Previously, they need only be in minor orders and not even deacons. Teodolfo Mertel, who died in 1899, was the last non-priest cardinal. In 1962, Pope John XXIII made it a rule <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> has been nominated a cardinal is required to be consecrated a bishop, if not one already, but some ask for and obtain dispensation from this requirement. It is rare that the Pope will appoint Cardinals who are priests only and not consecrated as a bishop.|$|E

25|$|Bin Laden and Al-Zawahiri {{organized}} an al-Qaeda {{congress on}} June 24, 1998. A week {{prior to the}} beginning of the conference, a group of well-armed assistants to al-Zawahiri had left by jeeps in the direction of Herat. Following the instructions of their patron, in the town of Koh-i-Doshakh they met three unknown Slavic-looking men who had arrived from Russia via Iran. After their arrival in Kandahar, they split up. One of the Russians was directly escorted to al-Zawahiri and he did not participate in the conference. Western military intelligence succeeded in acquiring photographs of him, but he disappeared for six years. According to Axis Globe, in 2004, when Qatar and U.S. investigated Russian embassy officials whom the United Arab Emirates had arrested in connection to the murder of Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in Qatar, computer software precisely established <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had walked to the Russian embassy in Doha was the same one who visited al-Zawahiri prior to the Al-Qaida conference.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{scholars}} of the time, an oath of divorce counted {{as a full}} divorce and they were also of the view that three oaths of divorce taken under one occasion counted as three separate divorces. The significance of this was, <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> divorces the same partner three times is no longer allowed to remarry that person until and if that person marries and divorces another man. Only then could the man, who took the oath, remarry his previous wife. Ibn Taymiyyah accepted this but rejected the validity of three oaths taken under one sitting, to count as three separate divorces {{as long as the}} intention was not to divorce. Moreover, Ibn Taymiyyah was of the view that a single oath of divorce uttered but not intended, also does not count as an actual divorce. He stated that since this is an oath much like an oath taken in the name of God, a person must expiate for an unintentional oath in a similar manner.|$|E
25|$|Responsible men {{can become}} more deeply {{convinced}} of {{the truth of the}} doctrine laid down by the Church on this issue if they reflect on the consequences of methods and plans for artificial birth control. Let them first consider how easily this course of action could open wide the way for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards. Not much experience is needed to be fully aware of human weakness and to understand that human beings—and especially the young, who are so exposed to temptation—need incentives to keep the moral law, and it is an evil thing to make it easy for them to break that law. Another effect that gives cause for alarm is <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman, and, disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium, reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his own desires, no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection.|$|E

Premiered on 21 November 1937 in Leningrad, it was a phenomenal success. The Fifth drove many to tears and welling emotions. Later, Shostakovich's purported memoir, Testimony, stated: [...] "I'll never believe <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> understood nothing could feel the Fifth Symphony. Of course they understood, they understood what was happening around them and they understood what the Fifth was about." ...|$|E

In March 2016, Judge Durkin ordered the appointment of a medical expert to review Hastert's health in preparation for sentencing. Later in March 2016, Judge Durkin postponed the sentencing hearing (over the objection of Hastert's attorneys) to April 27 so <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> alleged sexual abuse by Hastert (identified as [...] "Individual D" [...] in court) could testify at the sentencing.|$|E
