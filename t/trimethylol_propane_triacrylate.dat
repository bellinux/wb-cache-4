The ratio of EVA/ENR- 50 /HNT was fixed at 80 : 20 : 4. The nanocomposites were irradiated with a 3. 0 MeV electron beam machine at doses ranging from 50 to 200 kGy in air at room temperature. The effect of irradiation dose and co-agent <b>Trimethylol</b> <b>Propane</b> <b>Triacrylate</b> (TMPTA) on tensile strength and gel content of EVA/ENR- 50 /HNT nanocomposite were studied. It {{was found that}} the tensile strength and gel fraction of the EVA/ENR- 50 /HNT nanocomposites increased with the increased of irradiation dose. In the presence of TMPTA, a better performance in tensile strength was achieved due to the increased efficiency of irradiation induce crosslinking of EVA/ENR- 50 /HNT nanocomposite...|$|E

The {{urethane acrylate}} oligomer’s structure was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transforminfrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Two UV-curable coatings were prepared by blending the urethane acrylate oligomer, a reactivemonomer (1, 6 - hexanediol diacrylate (HDDA) or <b>trimethylol</b> <b>propane</b> <b>triacrylate</b> (TMPTA)) and a photoinitiator (2, 2 -dimethoxy- 2 -phenyl acetophenone). The UV curing process of such coatings was monitored by FT-IR and determination of thegel fraction. It was found that as the UV dose increased, the specific peaks at 1635 cm- 1 and 810 cm- 1, related to the carboncarbondouble (C=C) bond, decreased. Gel fraction of the cured coating film was found to increase with increasing radiationtime.

40|$|This study {{describes}} a multi-faceted materials selection problem that ultimately produces {{a new class}} of polymer–fiber composites with failure strains of near 400 % and ultimate tensile strengths (UTS’s) up to 20 MPa. Independent control of the rubbery modulus (proportional to the compressive force the composite can apply) is demonstrated by altering the crosslinker density of the polymer matrix and the fiber weave. The stress the composite can withstand can be modified with changing fiber material and weave geometry. The resulting SMP–fiber composites can be designed with glass transition temperatures (Tg’s) ranging from 0 C to 75 C, and specific multi-layer combinations of these systems provide a promising candidate for orthopedic casts: specifically, a woven anteres nylon lycra mesh rigidized with a polymer synthesized from methyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, isobornyl acrylate, and <b>trimethylol</b> <b>propane</b> <b>triacrylate.</b> The results of this study are intended to enable future orthopedic applications where the ability to accurately and independently position Tg and the ability to tune recoverable force in toughened, fiber-reinforced SMPs are required...|$|E

30|$|As {{polyurethane}} foams {{have very}} low thermal inertia, application of heat {{or a small}} flame can be enough to ignite them. In {{order to reduce the}} ignitability, and to a less extent the surface spread of flame and peak heat release rate, fire retardants are commonly added to commercial polyurethane foams in order to meet specific regulatory demands. A comprehensive review of fire retardants and their use in polyurethane foams was published by Singh and Jain (2009). The review refers to a publication by Babrauskas et al. (1991 b) wherein polyurethane containing a phosphate fire retardant caused immediate death of all of the animals. Early work by Voorhees (1975) identified what they described as ‘extreme toxicity’ of the combustion products of a phosphate fire retarded polyurethane foam. Voorhees suggested that the compound was a bicyclic phosphate compound and noted grand mal seizures followed by death in rats with a loading as low as 4  % by weight of the fire retardant. Analysis of the compound, <b>trimethylol</b> <b>propane</b> phosphate (TMPP), by Kimmerle (1976) found it to have a high acute toxicity when tested on rats. The formation of the toxicant in question was the result of an unusual reaction of the polyol in the foam, <b>trimethylol</b> <b>propane,</b> with the phosphate fire retardant in the gas phase.|$|R
40|$|Topographic and phase imaging in tapping mode atomic force {{microscopy}} (TMAFM) {{has been}} performed to investigate the effect of unmodified and modified dual phase fillers on the morphology of and the microdispersion of the filler particles in the rubber matrix. The above fillers were modified using acrylate monomer (<b>trimethylol</b> <b>propane</b> <b>triacrylate,</b> TMPTA) or a silane coupling agent (triethoxysilylpropyltetrasulphide, Si- 69) followed by electron beam modification at room temperature. Both unmodified and surface treated fillers were incorporated in a styrene-butadiene rubber. The phase images of the above composites show three levels of contrasts that correspond to matrix, filler aggregates, and bound rubber around the filler aggregates. Also, the images further elucidate the aggregated nature of the filler due to modification, which is more pronounced {{in the case of}} electron beam modified acrylated filler loaded rubber. The corresponding topographic images have been characterized by various statistical quantities like roughness parameters and one- and two-dimensional power spectral densities (1 D-PSD and 2 D-PSD). As compared to the control, significant increase in surface roughness is observed {{in the case of the}} modified dual phase filler loaded composites. The higher fractal value of these vulcanizates confirms the above fact.

40|$|Interpenetrating polymer {{networks}} (IPNs) of <b>trimethylol</b> <b>propane</b> <b>triacrylate</b> (TMPTA) and 1, 6 -hexane diol diacrylate (HDDA) {{at different}} weight ratios were synthesized. Temperature modulated {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (TMDSC) {{was used to determine}} whether the formation resulted in a copolymer or interpenetrating polymer network (IPN). These polymers are used as binders for microstereolithography (MSL) based ceramic microfabrication. The kinetics of thermal degradation of these polymers are important to optimize the debinding process for fabricating 3 D shaped ceramic objects by MSL based rapid prototyping technique. Therefore, thermal and thermo-oxidative degradation of these IPNs have been studied by dynamic and isothermal thermogravimetry (TGA). Non-isothermal model-free kinetic methods have been adopted (isoconversional differential and KAS) to calculate the apparent activation energy (E a) as a function of conversion (Î±) in N 2 and air. The degradation of these polymers in N 2 atmosphere occurs via two mechanisms. Chain end scission plays a dominant role at lower temperature while the kinetics is governed by random chain scission at higher temperature. Oxidative degradation shows multiple degradation steps having higher activation energy than in N 2. Isothermal degradation was also carried out to predict the reaction model which is found to be decelerating. It was shown that the degradation of PTMPTA follows a contracting sphere reaction model in N 2. However, as the HDDA content increases in the IPNs, the degradation reaction follows Avrami-Erofeev model and diffusion governed mechanisms. The intermediate IPN compositions show both type of mechanism. Based on the above study, debinding strategy for MSL based microfabricated ceramic structure has been proposed. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Non-degradable waste tire {{generation}} {{around the}} world is growing at an alarming rate. Diversifying the recycling route of these waste tires is essential to solve the problem. One way is to incorporate them into polymers and convert them into new products. However, incorporation of ground tire rubber into thermoplastics has been hampered due to lack of toughness and adhesion between phases. To address the issue, this study utilized reclaimed waste tire rubber (RTR) instead; and evaluated the properties of RTR and poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) blends. The properties of the RTR/EVA blends were further enhanced by compatibilization and electron beam irradiation. Processing, mechanical, thermal and dynamic mechanical properties of RTR were tremendously improved by blending with EVA. However, the interfacial adhesion was found to lack in the blends. Compatibilization by reactive, physical and combination strategies were explored utilizing (3 -Aminopropyl) triethoxy silane (APS), liquid styrene butadiene rubber (LR) and maleated EVA (MAEVA), respectively. APS and MAEVA were found to be the most and least favourable compatibilizer, respectively. Apart from functioning as reactive compatibilizer, APS also reclaimed the RTR phase further. These lead to improved dispersion of smaller RTR phase in EVA matrix and enhanced the interfacial adhesion. Electron beam irradiation revealed the presence of radical stabilizing and scavenging additives within RTR which retards the crosslinking process in RTR and RTR/EVA blends. Though chain scissions were predominant; study showed the replacement of S-S and S-C bonds with stronger and stiffer C-C bonds ensures the retention of RTR and RTR/EVA blends properties upon irradiation. Compatibilization of RTR/EVA blend by APS (50 RTR/ 5 APS) also improved the crosslinking efficiency. However, the blend still suffered from oxidative degradation from irradiation in air. Radiation sensitizers, <b>trimethylol</b> <b>propane</b> <b>triacrylate</b> (TMPTA), tripropylene glycol diacrylate (TPGDA) and N,N- 1, 3 Phenylene Bismaleimide (HVA 2), were used to accelerate the irradiation induced crosslinking in RTR and 50 RTR/ 5 APS blends. Presence of radiation sensitizers leads to simultaneous improvement in toughness and tensile strength of RTR and 50 RTR/ 5 APS blends. Elastic capacity of RTR phase was restored and interfacial adhesion enhanced in the presence of radiation sensitizers...|$|E

The functionality distribution of PEP has been derived from Si- 29 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the silyl derivative of PEP and chemical analysis. The extent of cure reaction (p) has been estimated by the use of an empirical relationship of the type: p = a - b(A(3) x F-s), where A(3) is the mole fraction of the trifunctional component of the OH group and F-s is the fraction of secondary hydroxyls in the system. A method for evaluating the constants a and b is presented. The calculated network parameters by the alpha-model are found to be in good agreement with the observed values.

BisGMA containing formulations presented lower shrinkage and stress but higher modulus and Rpmax than those containing BisEMA. TMPTMA presented the lowest stress among all diluents, as a result of lower conversion. EGDMA, DEGDMA, TEGDMA, and TETGDMA presented similar polymerization stress which was higher than the stress presented by D 3 MA and TMPTMA. D 3 MA presented similar conversion when copolymerized with both base monomers. The other diluents presented higher conversion when associated with BisEMA. EGDMA showed similar shrinkage compared with DEGDMA and higher than the other diluents. The lower conversion achieved by TMPTMA did not jeopardize its elastic modulus, similar to the other diluents. Despite the similar conversion presented by D 3 MA in comparison with EGDMA and DEGDMA, its lower elastic modulus may limit its use.

40|$|Oil-in-water (O/W) {{emulsions}} are broadly used in metal-machining processes, where combined lubrication and refrigeration are needed, {{such as in}} cutting, rolling, or grinding. These fluids {{consist of}} tiny oil droplets in water stabilised by small amounts of emulsifiers, namely surfactants. In an emulsion, oil {{is responsible for the}} lubricating properties, whereas water provides heat dissipation and fire resistance. Normally, emulsifiable metalworking oils are used in an oil concentration between 2 and 5 vol. %, depending on the application. Despite their wide use, the lubrication mechanisms of o/w emulsions have not been fully understood, mainly because of their complexity. Previous studies on oil-in-water emulsions showed that, in order to form thick lubricant films, oil droplets must wet the metal surfaces, displacing water. The ability of oil to wet is strongly dependent on the concentration of surfactant. Surfactant molecules tend to adsorb preferentially at the interface, modifying the nature of the layers adjacent to the metal surfaces and, thus, playing a key role in processes such as wettability, corrosion, or friction, as well as emulsion stability.

Chapter 1 details the testing of seven novel AChE inhibitors, demonstrating that neuronal networks rapidly detect small molecular differences in closely related compounds, and reveal information about their probable physiological effects that are not attainable through biochemical characterization alone. Chapter 2 shows how neuronal networks may be used to classify and characterize an unknown compound. The compound, <b>trimethylol</b> <b>propane</b> phosphate (TMPP) elicited changes in network activity that resembled those induced by bicuculline, a known epileptogenic. Further work determined that TMPP produces its effects on network activity through a competitive inhibition of the GABAA receptor. This demonstrates that neuronal networks can provide rapid, reliable warning of the presence of toxic substances, and from {{the manner in which the}} spontaneous activity changes provide information on the class of compound present and its potential physiological effects. Additional simple pharmacological tests can provide valuable information on primary mechanisms involved in the altered neuronal network responses. Chapter 3 explores the effects produced by a radical simplification of synaptic driving forces. With all synaptic interactions pharmacologically limited to those mediated through the NMDA synapse, spinal cord networks exhibited an extremely regular burst oscillation characterized by a period of 2. 9 ± 0. 3 s, with mean coefficients of variation of 3. 7, 4. 7, and 4. 9 % for burst rate, burst duration, and inter-burst interval, respectively (16 separate cultures). The reliability of expression of this oscillation suggests that it may represent a fundamental mechanism of importance during periods of NMDA receptor dominated activity, such as embryonic and early postnatal development. NMDA synapse mediated activity produces a precise oscillatory state that allows the study of excitatory-coupled network dynamics, burst mechanisms, emergent network properties, and structure-function relationships...|$|R

The molecular weight and its distribution were determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). The rheological properties were measured by Viscometer, and the drying time of film was obtained by drying recorder. The crosslinking reaction and weatherability were determined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) {{was used to evaluate}} the curing kinetics. It was found that the nature of drying oils, neutralizing agents, and cosolvents would significantly influence on the molecular weight, viscosity, stability, drying time and curing kinetics of the paints. When the tung/castor oil, was used as resin generally it showed a higher molecular weight and viscosity than those using soybean or linseed oil. The diethylamine neutralizing agent for paints exhibited the best stability and lower viscosity, In contrast, ammonia exhibited lower stability. The paints which included the resin that using linseed oil,ammonia and butyl cellosolve (EGMBE), showing the fastest drying time for coating film. However, the drying time of the film was found to be significantly decreased, due to blending it with high imino methylated melamine resin. But the crosslinking peak was very weak on the FTIR plot. It was also found that below 109 ℃ during the solvent evaporation stage,the endothermic peak occurred and it would suppress the DSC exotherm associated with the autooxidation crosslinking reaction. However,the temperature was above 109 ℃,the solvent would be completely evaporated,and exothermic reaction would occur,therefore the crosslinking reaction of amino alkyd resin at high temperature would be performed. It was found that the solvent may significantly influence on thermal behavior, and it was also found that the alkyd resin with more iodine value and lower preexponential constant (InZ) and lower activation energy, generally it would have a short drying time. The physical and chemical properties of the coating film depended on the rate of evaporation and stability of the neutralizing agent and the number of unsaturated double bond and hydroxyl group of oil modified alkyd resin. The paints those including the neutralizing agent and using ammonia, showed the best film hardness and water-resistance; but the paint using diethylamine system, exhibited a higher thermal degradation than that of the other 2 kinds of neutralizing agents. Regarding the evaluation of paint which contained a drying oil, linseed oil modified resin, it had a higher film hardness. In contrast, a blend of the drying oil which soybean oil was used as modified resin, it showed both better water-resistance and thermal degradation-resistance. In addition, whatever the substrate was used as coating, {{it was found that the}} film had good flexibility after 15 cycles of cold and hot treatment. In order to qualify the weatherability, the coated wood was placed in the artificially accelerated weatherometer (enclosed carbon-arc type) for 240 hours. The paint system which included ammonia and soybean oil modified resin still maintained a higher gloss retention than that of the other formulations. In addition,the film of the coated wood appeared to have better appearance after 240 hours of exposure. According to the SRS-FTIR measurement, the absorption peak of the methoxyl group (915 cm- 1) and alkyl group (1376 cm- 1) disappeared after 240 hours of exposure. The absorption peak of the triazine ring (1556 cm- 1) disappeared after 268 hours, while the absorption peaks of the carbonyl group(1710 cm- 1, 1721 cm- 1) increased after 268 hours. It was found that the fastest drying time for coating film in air was the alkyd resin containing 5 % <b>trimethylol</b> <b>propane</b> diallyl ether (TMPDAE). Alkyd resin containing 10 % or 15 % had a longer drying time, therefore it would not have any improved effect. With a relative humidity under 65 % and various temperature, it was found that in creasing the temperature resulted in an increased speed of the drying of the film. It also indicated the synergism of both temperature and relative humidity in affecting the drying rate of film. The alkyd resin coating containing 5 % TMPDAE in air at 50 ℃ and under 45 % RH, 2 hours drying time would be required. When UV illumination was applied, the drying time was reduced to 1 hour. Under these condition, the drying time of film was 9 - 18 times faster than drying in air at 25 ℃ and under 65 %RH condition. With a DSC experiment, it was found that increasing the TMPDAE content, resulted in an increasing in the speed of the crosslinking reaction of the film. This indicated that the synergism of temperature and TMPDAE would affect the rate of crosslinking reaction. 高亞胺型甲基化三聚氰胺樹脂可作為水溶性醇酸樹脂之架橋劑，在不需添加酸觸媒下能夠調配氣乾型水性塗料。使用膠體滲透層析儀 (GPC) ， 霍氏 轉換紅外線光譜儀(FTIR) ，示差掃瞄熱卡儀(DSC) 及其他相關儀器 ，評估 樹脂塗料系統之性質及塗膜性能，結果歸納如下： 1. 樹脂塗料之分子量、黏度、穩定性、乾燥性、硬化動力學及塗膜物理 化學性能，主要受乾性油種類，中和劑種類所影響。桐油／篦麻油者 顯示最高分子量及黏度，依次為大豆油及亞麻仁油者；二乙胺中和之 塗料具有最佳穩定性及低黏度；氨者則穩定性最差，含亞麻仁油變性 之結合劑、氨中和劑及乙二醇單丁醚(EGMBE) 共溶劑之配方，塗膜乾 燥速度最快。 2. DSC試驗知，水溶性塗料系統，在溶劑揮發階段，呈現吸熱峰，壓住 自動氧化聚合之放熱反應，溫度升高至 109 ℃溶劑完全揮發後，則顯 示平緩的放熱現象，係高溫下胺基樹脂與醇酸樹脂之架橋反應。又知 塗膜乾燥速度與醇酸樹脂之碘價呈正相關，與塗料動力學之前指數 常數的自然對數(lnZ) 及活化能(Ea) 則具負相關性，此三項性質與塗 膜乾燥速度之關係，非常顯著。 3. 氨中和者之塗料，在塗膜硬度、耐水性表現最好，二乙胺中和者耐劣 化溫度最高；亞麻仁油變性之樹脂塗料，其塗膜硬度最高，桐油/篦 麻油者附著性最好，大豆油者在耐水性及耐熱性均佳。三種中和劑與 三種氣乾型水溶性醇酸樹脂所調配塗料，其塗膜可撓性均佳。 4. 木質塗裝材經 240 小時人工促進耐候處理，塗膜外觀尚保持良好，但 由SRS-FTIR光譜分析，顯示樹脂之化學組成已發生光降解反應，其胺 基樹脂之甲氧基(915 cm- 1) 及烴基(1376 cm- 1) 吸收峰，顯示消失， 268 小時暴露後三氮雜環(1556 cm- 1) 吸收峰亦消失，且羰基(1710 cm- 1 ， 1721 cm- 1) 明顯增加。 5. 醇酸樹脂含 5 %丙烯醚化合物(TMPDAE) 之塗料系統，顯著縮短塗膜氣乾 時間，但 10 %及 15 %者則沒有改善效果。又知，塗膜於相對濕度 65 %， 在不同溫度下之乾燥時，顯示乾燥速率隨溫度升高，逐漸增快，而溫 濕度之作用具有相加相乘之增效效益。當溫度為 50 ℃，相對濕度為 45 %，塗膜乾燥時間約 2 小時，附加照射紫外光者則於１小時氣乾硬 化，它較乾燥條件在 25 ℃， 65 %RH者快 9 - 18 倍。封面 目錄 表目錄 圖目錄 摘 要 SUMMARY 一、緒言 二、文獻回顧 (一) 水溶性樹脂之開發與沿革 (二) 水溶性三聚氰胺樹脂架橋劑之性質 (三) 水溶性醇酸樹脂之性質 (四) 氣乾型水溶性胺基醇酸樹脂之硬化反應性質 (五) 胺基醇酸樹脂之架橋反應模式 (六) 中和劑對水溶性樹脂塗料之影響 (七) 添加對氣乾型水溶性胺基醇酸樹脂之影響 (八) 塗膜硬化與塗裝性能之評估 三、氣乾型水溶性醇酸樹脂之合成與所調配塗料之性質 (一) 試驗材料與方法 試驗材料與方法 1. 材料 【 1 】樹脂合成與塗料調配 【 2 】水溶油變性醇酸樹脂之合成 【 2 】商業用高亞胺型甲基化三聚氰按樹脂 【 3 】塗料調配 (2) 塗料塗佈用玻璃基材 (3) KRS- 5 晶片 2. 方法 (1) 酸價 (2) 羥價 (3) 碘價 (4) 色數 (5) 分子量與分子量分佈 (6) 樹脂黏度及流變性質 (7) 表面張力 (8) 塗料穩定性 (9) 乾燥時間 (10) 紅外線光譜 (11) 硬化動力學分析 (二) 結果與討論 四、氣乾型水溶性胺基醇酸樹脂塗料塗膜性質 (一) 試驗材料與方法 1 材料 (1) 木質基材 (2) 塗料塗佈用玻璃基材 (3) 塗料 2. 方法 【 1 】 試片之塗裝 (2) 塗膜性質測定 【 1 】塗膜硬度 【 2 】 塗膜附著力 (A) 方格試驗 (B) 剝離強度試驗 【 3 】塗膜抗化學性質 (A) 塗膜耐水性 (B) 塗膜耐鹼性 (C) 塗膜耐酸性 【 4 】塗膜熱劣化性 【 5 】塗膜冷熱循環試驗 【 6 】人工促進耐候試驗 (二) 結果與討論 五、塗料氣乾性質之改良 (一) 試驗材料與方法 1. 材料 (1) 樹脂合成與塗料調配 【 1 】水溶性醇酸樹脂之合成 【 2 】商業用高亞胺型甲基化三聚氰胺樹脂 【 3 】塗料調配 (2) 塗料塗佈用玻璃基材 (3) KRS- 5 晶片 (4) 紫外光起始劑 (5) DSC分析鋁盤 2. 方法 (1) 硬化乾燥時間測定 (2) 紫外光照射對塗膜乾燥時間之影響 (3) 硬化 動力學分析 (4) 紅外線光譜 (二) 結果與討論 六、結論 七、參考文...|$|R
