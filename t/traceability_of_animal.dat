40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to demonstrate whether the data recorded by the tracing systems of long journey animal transport vehicles for the official controls under Regulation 1 / 2005 and managed by different private service providers for trucks fitted with their systems could be made remotely available to competent authorities in this decentralised system architecture. The concept was tested for around 2 months with 2 tracing systems from different service providers, with volunteering transport companies using these systems and with the participation of competent authorities in 3 Member States with a substantial share in the international animal transport. Overall the experiment proved that with limited software development resources the integration of commercial tracing systems in animal transports would be feasible and offer several advantages to the competent authorities both in respect of animal welfare and <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> movement.

40|$|The {{identification}} of individuals’ breed of origin has several practical applications in livestock and {{is useful in}} different biological contexts such as conservation genetics, breeding and authentication of animal products. In this paper, penalized multinomial regression was applied to identify the minimum number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from high-throughput genotyping data for individual assignment to dairy sheep breeds reared in Sicily. The combined use of penalized multinomial regression and stability selection {{reduced the number of}} SNPs required to 48. A final validation step on an independent population was carried out obtaining 100 % correctly classified individuals. The results using independent analysis, such as admixture, Fst, principal component analysis and random forest, confirmed the ability of these methods in selecting distinctive markers.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to verify if the dietary inclusion of sugarcane yeast at levels commonly used in broiler diets influences the traceability of cattle meat meal and poultry offal meal, using the technique of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in the breast muscle of chickens. A number of 325 one-d-old male broilers were randomly distributed into 13 treatments with 25 birds each. Treatments consisted of a control diet based on corn and soybean meal, and the inclusion of 1, 2, 4, or 6 % meat and bone meal, poultry offal meal or sugarcane yeast. At 42 days of age, six birds per treatment were randomly selected, sacrificed, and their breast muscle was collected for isotopic ration analysis. The isotopic ratio of birds fed the diet with inclusion of 6 % sugarcane yeast was different from those fed the control treatment, but not from those fed diets with the inclusion of 2, 4 and 6 % meat and bone meal or 4 and 6 % poultry offal meal.

A coded manual {{of operations for the}} electronic identification <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> in the practice on a large scale according different electronic devices (injectable transponders or ceramic boluses) was implemented. An experimental Help Desk Service (HDS) was created as a practical support concerning animal welfare, veterinary aspects and losses/breakages of electronic identifiers. An evolution of the system to check performance of RFID technology in farms was due to the detection of bolus/transponders presence in animals body by digitalized X-ray analysis, thus allowing a sound check for operators and for reliability assessment. A very weak point was identified in a consistent loss (36. 9 %) of miniboluses (20 g) in goats, after 2 years from the first electronic identification.

40|$|AbstractThe future {{agriculture}} {{must maintain}} biodiversity and assure food production by the implementation ofdurableinnovative technologies. It {{is important to}} use innovative methods {{in order to determine}} the <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> products as the concept of bio-economy supposesthe reduction of external marginal costs with the increase of social benefit by the reduction of the bio- resources used. The private marginal benefit for each animal breeder is also represented by the corrective subvention of 10 euros/animal and the co-operation with the sanitary- veterinary authorities leads to the increase of positive externalities. These external marginal benefits must be promoted and supported for an optimal time so as to eliminate sick animals from each EU country. The research team used advanced tools to identify the traceability of the food products (meat or milk) from different breeds as well as the traceability of certain traditional products by molecular tests based on the identification, amplification of nucleic acids for the traceability of food products (by PCR techniques). Several methods for the determination of genetic traceability were tested and applied. The best of all seems to be the DNA analysis as “Genetic Fingerprinting”, which can be found in each cell and more recently, the micro-satellite analysis. This scientific paper presents the results of research concerning the determination of genotypes by microsatellite genetic markers, collecting and preserving the tissue samples by Typi Fix method as well as the influence of positive externalities, which have a role in substantiating the decisions to put into practice certain scientific research result...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to develop breed-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in five pig breeds sequenced with Illumina's Genome Analyzer and to investigate their usefulness for breed assignment purposes. DNA pools were prepared for Duroc, Landrace, Large White, Pietrain and Wild Boar. The total number of animals used for sequencing was 153. SNP discovery was performed by aligning the filtered reads against Build 7 of the pig genome. A total of 313, 964 high confidence SNPs were identified and analysed for the presence of breed-specific SNPs (defined in this context as SNPs for which one of the alleles was detected in only one breed). There were 29, 146 putative breed-specific SNPs identified, of which 4441 were included in the PorcineSNP 60 beadchip. Upon re-examining the genotypes obtained using the beadchip, 193 SNPs were confirmed as being breed specific. These 193 SNPs were subsequently used to assign an additional 490 individuals from the same breeds, using the sequenced individuals as reference populations. In total, four breed assignment tests were performed. Results showed that for all methods tested 99 % of the animals were correctly assigned, with an average probability of assignment of at least 99. 2 %, indicating the high utility of breed-specific markers for breed assignment and traceability. This study provides a blueprint for the way next-generation sequencing technologies can be used for the identification of breed-specific SNPs, as well as evidence that these SNPs may be a powerful tool for breed assignment and <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> products to their breeds of origin...|$|E
40|$|The {{future of}} the Veterinary Practice in Dairy Health Management has changed and will change more {{drastically}} {{from our point of}} view in the next years. The consumer’s pressure and the Media are more and more concerned about animal welfare, <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> products and safety of products of animal origin. On the other hand the Farmers in Europe have to produce under strong rules (competing with other countries outside Europe), which are normally very expensive to put in practice, and the veterinarians should adapt their knowledge to the new challenges, because without their work and cooperation, dairy farming will have no future. In that sense, the old veterinary practice has to go in other ways, otherwise the Veterinarians will loose clients and the animal population in Europe will be reduced. The Dairy farmers will ask for support in other areas besides clinical: efficacy, management, welfare, profitability, nutrition, prophylaxis, economics, reproduction, environmental protection, grassland management, etc. Cattle practitioners should be able to give answers in several subjects and this sets the challenge to our profession - Veterinary preparation has to be very strong in single animal species, particularly in Dairy or beef cows. The cattle practitioner has to look beyond, but he should never forget that “the single animal” has to be looked at as one unit of the herd, which means that without a very good knowledge of the single animal he will be insufficiently prepared to solve herd problems, and the Herd is the sum of several animals. We all know that very often one single animal allows us to implement herd strategies and develop prophylactic programs. We are convinced that the veterinary profession, and in our case the Cattle Medicine should have the ability to evolve, otherwise the Veterinarian as we know him will miss the train in the next years...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{both the}} demand and the supply for food <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> origin have {{experienced}} important changes making of fundamental importance the implementation <b>of</b> <b>traceability</b> systems.

With the goal of developing a breed genetic traceability system for Girgentana dairy products, the aim of this study was to identify specific microsatellite markers able to discriminate among the most important Sicilian dairy goat breeds, in order to detect possible adulteration in Girgentana dairy products. A total of 20 microsatellite markers were analyzed on 338 individual samples from Girgentana, Maltese, and Derivata di Siria goat breeds. Specific microsatellite markers useful for <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> dairy products were identified. Eight microsatellite markers showed alleles present at the same time in Maltese and Derivata di Siria and absent in Girgentana and, therefore, they were tested on DNA pools of the three breeds. Considering the electropherograms' results, only FCB 20, SRCRSP 5, and TGLA 122 markers were tested on DNA samples extracted from cheeses of Girgentana goat breed.

40|$|Since {{the breed}} of origin highly affects the beef price, {{reliable}} methods {{are needed to}} detect incorrect declarations. As most breeds are standardised for coat colour, the Melanocortin 1 Receptor gene (MC 1 R), involved in the regulation of eu/pheomelanins synthesis, has been suggested as marker for breed <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> products <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> origin. The aim of this investigation is to characterise the main breeds reared in the Piedmont Region by MC 1 R locus and to apply {{the analysis of the}} locus to breed <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> beef cuts purchased in different outlets of the Region. A total of 168 DNA samples of four cattle breeds (Piemontese, Blonde d’Aquitaine, Italian Friesian and Aosta Red Pied) were analysed for MC 1 R locus by PCR-RFLP. In addition, 28 DNA samples from beef with breed indication were tested. Piemontese and Blonde d’Aquitaine were monomorphic for the E+and eallele, respectively. In the Friesian breed the EdEd genotype was the most frequent, but Edewas also observed (2 %). Aosta Red Pied was the most variable breed, with the presence of the three alleles and five genotypes out of six. The comparison of the genotypic distribution in the four breeds clearly indicates {{that it is possible to}} distinguish among Piemontese, Blonde d’Aquitaine and Friesian breeds, but the same is not true for Aosta Red Pied, which has genotypes in common with the other breeds. The results on beef samples revealed a high percentage of mislabelling (about 18 %), which concerned Friesian breed and crossbreds. These results indicate that MC 1 R locus is an effective marker in breed <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> beef, when the involved breeds are characterised by different genotypes. Moreover, compared to other genetic markers, it has the great advantage of not requiring DNA reference sam- ples. This survey, though limited, has revealed a high percentage of incompatibilities. Therefore, the analysis of MC 1 R locus is recommended in the framework of product certification, at least for random controls within a system aimed at preventing fraud...|$|R
40|$|European Agriculture is in a {{dramatic}} phase of changes, especially in those countries which have undergone considerable transformation processes. The global trend of liberalization requests from all countries a re-orientation of the agricultural policy and free access to the European markets. In addition, experience is accumulating {{that we are in}} a phase of global warming. We can only speculate about the outcome of these trends, however, we must assume that the consequences will be different for lowland and mountain agriculture and in the various agroecological zones of Europe. Risk is increasing that mountain farmers will be faced with stronger competition from the lowland farmer and from the harsh international markets. The effects of warming may increase plant productivity, but they can also jeopardize the economic situation of many mountain regions. Lower earnings in winter tourism will reinforce economic disparities between urban areas and the less developed alpine region. The uncertainty surrounding potential threats has been, and is, frequently used as a reason not to develop research strategies for sustainable mountain farming systems. This situation is quite obvious, when we compare past and actual research efforts devoted to the different components of mountain ecosystems. Research providing policy advice has a high priority. It is widely accepted that agriculture and particularly mountain farming has a multifunctional role- but is its long-term development guided by an appropriate research support? Field experts followed since many decades the floristic changes of pastures and meadows under different management in various regions. Traditional and indigenous knowledge served as a guideline for the best practise recommendations. The underlying mechanisms of the floristic changes and of the responses to management have been rarely investigated. The same is even truer for the consequences of floristic changes and/or potential site-specific effects on the quality and <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> products from mountain agriculture. Scientific evidence is badly needed. To increase the awareness of the multifunctional role of mountain agriculture we cannot rely only on expectations about positive effects of managed pastures on the landscape with beneficial effects for the tourism. Solid data are urgently needed about the service function of pastures and forests for storage and cycling of water, biodiversity, biogeochemical cycles and soil conservation. Indicators do fulfil many useful, primarily short-term functions, but they cannot provide the necessary mechanistic understanding. Does the abandonment of pastures or an intensification of the agricultural land-use necessarily result in impairment of ecosystem services? Very limited knowledge is actually available in this domain. Sustainable management of natural resources is affected by a wide range of factors, those relating to the underlying biological/ecological system and those relating to human use and impact. Threats to sustainable resource management and biodiversity cannot be specified solely in terms of ecology; they are linked with and driven by broader socio-economic factors including markets and political dynamics. Therefore, specific decisions about land-use, management and policy measures will vary widely according to circumstances. Only the cooperation of different disciplines with various new scientific approaches can provide the knowledge needed to develop sustainable mountain farming systems which meet also the multiple expectation of the society.

The aim of this experiment was to study retention rate and functionality of electronic identification systems in pigs, injected in different sites, to evaluate <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> and highlight histopathological alterations of tissues in different inoculation sites. A total of 60 crossbred piglets were used to compare different transponder inoculation sites. One group (15 piglets) was identified only by plastic ear tags; and three groups were identified by passive injectable transponders (PIT) with different inoculation sites. Pigs were slaughtered in two different moments, in order to evaluate injection sites, macroscopically and histologically, either 50 days after injection or at a normal slaughtering weight. In general, no apparent animal health problems were observed {{the day after the}} injection or during the control readings performed during the experiment. Intraperitoneal localization gave excellent results in term of readability until the slaughter time. Transponders at the slaughter line were always recovered in the viscera tray because they were found loose in the peritoneal cavity. In some cases, they were found on the carcasses, attached to the peritoneum. In those cases a sample of peritoneal tissue was collected for histological examination. A reparative chronic reaction with moderate and multifocal fibrosis and neoformed vessels associated to multifocal and mild lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate were detected. In one case (6. 7 %) the transponder was found on the visceral side of the liver and the histological examination highlighted a localized superficial hepatic atrophy by compression. Retroauricolar site of injection gave lower readability results because 2 transponders (13. 3 %) were no more readable during the first month after injection. No lesions were found with this inoculation site. PIT injected in the perineal region were operative until slaughter time. Recovery procedures at the slaughter house were simple for animals slaughtered at a low weight, but much more difficult in the case of heavy pigs. Moreover, in three cases (20 %), PITs were no more in the subcutaneous tissue but they had an intramuscular localization.

Genetic characterisation by molecular markers is a fundamental prerequisite for managing genetic resources and for developing potential genetic traceability protocols. In order to improve the knowledge on Modicana, Cinisara and Sardo-Modicana breeds and to evaluate the possibility to develop DNA-based protocols for their mono-breeds products traceability, the genetic structure of MC 1 R gene was analysed. Four main alleles were observed in a representative sample <b>of</b> 162 <b>animals.</b> In the black coated Cinisara breed (n = 42), the E D and E + alleles segregated with a frequency of 0. 93 for E D allele.

On-farm data could provide a detailed overview of the antimicrobial use, but technical and methodological aspects of data collection and interpretation, as well as data quality need to be further assessed. The aims of this study were (1) to quantify antimicrobial use in the study population using different units of measurement and contrast the results obtained, (2) to evaluate data quality of farm records on antimicrobial use, and (3) to compare data quality of different recording systems. During 1 year, data on antimicrobial use were collected from 97 dairy farms. Antimicrobial consumption was quantified using: (1) the incidence density of antimicrobial treatments; (2) the weight of active substance; (3) the used daily dose and (4) the used course dose for antimicrobials for intestinal, intrauterine and systemic use; and (5) the used unit dose, for antimicrobials for intramammary use. Data quality was evaluated by describing completeness and accuracy of the recorded information, and by comparing farmers' and veterinarians' records. Relative consumption of antimicrobials depended on the unit of measurement: used doses reflected the treatment intensity better than weight of active substance. The use of antimicrobials classified as high priority was low, although under- and overdosing were frequently observed.

The aims of the study were (i) to compare the capacity and the limits of both methods with respect to the determination <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> constituents <b>of</b> varying composition, (ii) to verify a correct interpretation of the results from each method and (iii) to determine an optimum application area for each method. Both methods complemented each other. The microscopic approach allowed a reproducible, high sensitive and quantitative determination <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> ingredients with morphological detectable structures, and in the presence of bone fragments a d i fferentiation between fish and terrestrial animals was possible simultaneously. The PCR-analysis provided the detection <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> ingredients in feed even in absence of visible structures but fishmeal was not detected in a sufficient manner by the chosen screening setup. However, the PCR-method enabled to differentiate between animal groups or species and to identify animal species. The methods complemented each other not only in the analytical features but also regarding the results produced by the detection of two different analytical targets of PAPs, morphological structures and gene sequences, r e s p e c t i v e l y. Suitable data regarding the presence of their analytical targets were produced by each method, but a combination of both methods enabled furthermore to report correct results regarding the presence of the artificially composed PAPs in the feed samples. It was concluded that a combination of microscopy and PCR-analysis is reasonable for special application purposes to determine PAPs in feed: while microscopy provides reliable results also in highly processed feed with wellpreserved morphological animal structures even with highly degraded genomic material, PCR provides applicable results in feed samples with preserved genomic animal material even after the separation of morphological structures.

The hypothesis of this study was that the majority beef samples retailed in the local market originate from female with a great participation of zebu breeds. Therefore, the objective of this work was to characterize retail beef samples with DNA markers that identify cattle sex and breed composition. Within 10 beef shops localized in Pirassununga, SP, Brazil, 61 samples were collected, all were genotyped as harboring Bos taurus mitochondrial DNA and 18 were positive for the Y chromosome amplification (male). For the marker sat 1711 b-Msp I the frequency of the allele A was 0. 278 and for the marker Lhr-Hha I the frequency of the allele T was 0. 417. The results of sat 1711 b-Msp I and Lhr-Hha I allelic frequencies are suggestive that the proportion of indicus genome compared with the taurine genome in the market meat is smaller than the observed in the Nellore breed.

We use the modern genotyping tool {{for the study of}} zootechnical biodiversity- molecular biology tests- based on identification, amplification and characterization of nucleic acid, revolutionized the conservation <b>of</b> indigene <b>animal</b> genetic resources, gene assisted selection, pathology diagnostic and food traceability. The original Tipy Fix methods – internatinal patented by Prof. Brem - that were used in Romania (using {{for the first time in}} Romania by the researchers of CSCBA) to reveal DNA polymorphism are described as their applicability in species identification and meat <b>traceability.</b> Vulnerability <b>of</b> farm <b>animal</b> breeds is caused by the lack of interest apart breeders for one breed. In Hateg land area the main mean of reducing biodiversity in farm animals is the crossbreeding. It was analysis the prion protein for scrapie resistance genotyping as codonamino acid at codon 136, 154, 171 from 5 known haplotypes resulting PrP Genotype.

40|$|Beef is {{characterized}} by a high and uncontrolled variability of its quality which is one reason for the dissatisfaction of consumers. Therefore, the beef industry is asking for muscular markers to predict the ability <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> to produce high quality beef. Thanks to the development of genomics, some recent research allowed the identification of markers for muscle growth potential of bovines, for marbling and tenderness of beef and for <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> grass-based systems.

Italian Journal <b>of</b> <b>Animal</b> Science, 4, (3), 49 - 72 Key words: Quality, Safety, Meat, Fish, Dairy productsQuality must now {{be considered as a}} convergence between consumers' wishes and needs and the intrinsic and extrinsic quality attributes of food products. The increasing number of quality attributes which must be considered, increasing globalisation and the heterogeneity in consumption habits between countries are making this convergence progressively more difficult. In parallel, science is rapidly evolving (with the advent of genomics for instance), {{and a growing number of}} applications is thus expected for the improvement of food safety and quality. Among the meat and fish quality attributes, colour is very important because it determines, at least in part, consumer choice. The key targets to ensure a satisfactory colour are animal nutrition and management for fish, processing and product conditioning for meat. Tenderness and flavour continue to be important issues for the consumer because eating remains a pleasure. They both determine quality experience which itself influences repetitive purchase. Meat tenderness is a very complex problem which can be solved only by a holistic approach involving all the factors from conception, animal breeding and production, muscle biology and slaughter practice to carcass processing and meat preparation at the consumer end. Today, safety and healthiness are among the most important issues. Unfortunately, animal products can potentially be a source of biological and chemical contamination for consumers. The introduction of both control strategies along the food chain and the development of a food safety management system, from primary production to the domestic environment, are key issues that must be achieved. Despite a high dietary supply of saturated fats by dairy and meat products, it is imperative that professionals involved in animal research and in the associated industry convey the positive nutritional contributions <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> products to both consumers and health professionals. The latter include protein of high biological value, iron, zinc, healthy fatty acids including omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and conjugated linoleic acid. Fish products are well known for their high content in PUFA. Meanwhile, new strategies in terms of antioxidant supply are required to limit PUFA and cholesterol oxidation, which has many detrimental effects including contributing to reduced sensory attributes.
