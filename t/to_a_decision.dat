5|$|At the 2000 Perl Conference, Jon Orwant made a {{case for}} a major new language-initiative. This led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> to begin work on a {{redesign}} of the language, to be called Perl 6. Proposals for new language features were solicited from the Perl community at large, which submitted more than 300 RFCs.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{a series}} of phone calls between band members {{resulted}} in some low-key rehearsals, and soon <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> to reunite. By February 2004, a full tour was announced, and tickets for nearly all the initial tour dates sold out within minutes. The band's four-night run at London's Brixton Academy was the fastest selling in the venue's twenty-year history.|$|E
5|$|In {{the town}} hall, {{the members of}} the town council decide that it is rather hasty to come <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> about {{creating}} a new post after just ten years of discussion.

5|$|PLC {{also offers}} a unique special {{education}} unit catering to students with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities. The transition programme was developed in 1992 in response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> by academic staff to provide a special-needs stream. Through this unit, up to 20 girls {{between the ages of}} 11 and 18 are provided with an individual curriculum incorporating mainstream classes where possible.|$|E
5|$|The newer M5000 trams {{proved to}} be {{considerably}} more reliable than the T-68/A fleet; which averaged 5,000 miles between breakdowns, while the M5000's averaged 20,000 miles. This led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> in 2012 to withdraw the entire fleet from service {{and replace them with}} M5000's. All of the T-68 and T-68As were withdrawn between April 2012 and April 2014.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Hurcomb {{put forward}} at a ministerial meeting a {{solution}} whereby {{the members of}} the inquiry would inform NESCo that on purely technical grounds they would have approved the scheme, but due to the opposition of Morrison, they had decided not to proceed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision.</b> Although NESCo were initially hostile, in June 1945 they agreed to drop the scheme on condition that they received a letter from Morrison agreeing that they had satisfied the commissioners on technical grounds, thus entitling them to compenstation. The Government thought the site was open to well founded objections, and even if the scheme had proceeded past the inquiry stage, they would have refused consent anyway.|$|E
5|$|In July 1676 Carbery {{called for}} a hearing against Morgan {{in front of the}} Assembly of Jamaica, accusing him of collaborating with the French to attack Spanish interests. Morgan {{admitted}} he had met the French officials, but indicated that that this was diplomatic relations, rather than anything duplicitous. In the summer of 1677 the Lords of Trade said they had yet to come <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> on the matter and in early 1678 the king and the Privy Council recalled Carbery from Jamaica, leaving Morgan as governor for three months. In July 1678 Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle was appointed governor.|$|E
5|$|In case of brief incapacitation {{to execute}} {{the office of the}} President of Croatia due to absence, illness or vacations, the {{president}} may transfer his powers to the Speaker of the Croatian Parliament to act as a deputy. The president decides on the revocation of this authority and his return to the office. If the president is prevented from performing his duties {{for a longer period of}} time due to illness or other form of incapacitation, and especially if the president is unable to decide on a transfer of powers to a deputy, the Speaker of the parliament becomes the acting president, assuming presidential duty pursuant <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> of the Constitutional Court, made upon request of the Government.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} morning Sissener {{suggests}} the two go driving blindfolded. The stunt goes surprisingly well, but as Sissener pulls over the car, he dies. Odd is now left with responsibility for Sissener's dog and with an urgency to live life to the fullest. He makes {{his way up to}} the Holmenkollen ski jump, where he sees a vision of his mother as a young woman, doing the jump. He comes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> and starts to do the ski jump. Odd, for the first time no longer wearing his railwayman's jacket, rides the train to Bergen, where Svea is happily waiting for him on the platform.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, Snedden created {{a plan to}} let the paper's {{employees}} buy the company and keep ownership local. This plan was under way {{at the time of}} Snedden's death in 1989, but by 1992, many of the paper's employees were nearing retirement age. This factor, and the need for costly upgrades to expand the paper onto the Internet, led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> to sell the News-Miner to Dean Singleton and Richard Scudder, co-founders of the MediaNews Group newspaper chain. In order to preserve the paper's independence—something desired by Snedden—the News-Miner was purchased by the family trusts of the two men, with ownership split 50/50 between the two trusts.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{losses were}} modest. The British {{assessed}} that two Japanese aircraft {{had been destroyed}} and another three damaged during attacks on airfields at Truk. Damage was also {{believed to have been}} inflicted on the airfields, floating dry dock, oil tanks, other harbour installations and ships that were attacked. Following the operation, Brind assessed that rockets had proven more useful than bombs, and was critical of the gunnery of all the cruisers other than Newfoundland. Members of the Japanese garrison told US Strategic Bombing Survey investigators after the war that the British raid had resulted in practically no damage. The most significant loss was the destruction of part of the garrison's records, which led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> to bury the remaining files.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. The 45 minutes of qualifying were split into parts of eighteen, fifteen and twelve minutes of running respectively. While Sauber were able to place Felipe Nasr in a new car in time for qualifying following his accident in practice, Jenson Button's problems could not be sorted out and he missed the session, meaning that his participation in the race would be left <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> by the race stewards.|$|E
5|$|The F-111Cs {{gave the}} RAAF a {{powerful}} strike capability but were never used in combat. The aircraft went through modernisation {{programs in the}} 1980s and 1990s, and the RAAF acquired improved weapons to maintain their ability to penetrate hostile airspace. Despite this, by the 2000s the F-111Cs were becoming outdated and expensive to maintain, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> to retire them in 2010 rather than 2020 as originally planned. The F-111s were replaced by 24 Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets pending delivery of F-35 Lightning IIs in development.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{traditional}} Israeli historiography, Arab {{sources in}} general {{do not see}} it as {{a turning point in the}} war. They agree that the Egyptian declarations regarding Tel Aviv as the main strategic objective were ostentatious rather than operative. In his book 1948, New Historian Benny Morris also disagrees with the traditional Israeli view, and states that portraying the operation as the catalyst for the Egyptian halt is a mistake. However, in a March 15, 2007 panel of historians, Morris said that at least in the Egyptian expeditionary force, the Israeli attack did lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> to stop advancing.|$|E
5|$|While it was {{possibly}} an overstatement {{to describe the}} 1975 position as a choice between evils, neither {{of the two major}} political groupings reached the 15 October 1975 crunch position with completely clean hands.
