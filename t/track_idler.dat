25|$|M3E2/M5 Half-track – International Harvester Half-Track, {{externally}} largely {{identical to}} the M3, but with , IHC RED-450-B engine, different drive train and fuel and electrical system. In fact, only the chassis, bogies, <b>track,</b> <b>idler</b> and drive sprockets, wheels, winches, transfer case, rollers, and machine gun mount were interchangeable. The M5 is heavier than the M3, {{due in part to}} heavier armor. Its body was welded, rather than bolted. The M5 was primarily for Lend-Lease, to Britain, Canada, France, and the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|A tank {{suspension}} (for each side) {{consisted of}} two bogies, four rubber-covered return rollers, a track driving wheel and a <b>track</b> <b>idler.</b> Each bogie consisted of a cast box, four twin rubber-covered road wheels connected by balancing levers and two one-quarter elliptic leaf springs. The cast track driving wheel with removable sprocket ring was located in front, and the <b>track</b> <b>idler</b> with a crank lever tightener was located in the rear part of the vehicle. A track made from chrome-nickel steel was [...] wide and consisted of 108–109 links.|$|E

5|$|Some early T-26 {{tanks were}} {{repaired}} in tank units or factories {{with the use}} of later production parts. This meant replacing the all-rubber road wheels (except the front wheels) and <b>track</b> <b>idlers</b> with new strengthened ones. Armour was added for the headlight, the armour thickness of the driver's hatch lower door of the twin-turreted tanks was increased from 6 to 10mm and armoured PT-1 or PTK observation devices were installed. A common hatch above the engine, oil tank, and fuel tank was mounted starting in May 1940. In 1940, 255 T-26s were modernised in this way and {{in the first half of}} 1941 another 85 tanks were improved. A central factory responsible for the T-26's repair and modernisation was the Factory of Carrying-and-Conveying Machines named after S. Kirov in Leningrad, and the Factory No. 105 named after L. Kaganovich in Khabarovsk from the beginning of the Great Patriotic War until 1945.|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of the bachelor´s thesis {{introduces}} crawler chassis used in forwarders and harvesters, its second part includes a concept design of a crawler chassis for a forwarder based on the given parameters. The design concentrates on the arrangement of the undercarriage and the choice of suitable <b>track</b> and <b>idlers.</b> Another intention of the design is to find an appropriate solution for suspension of bottom rollers with a sufficient travel, while observing small dimensions of the undercarriage. The outcome of the thesis is a drawing of the designed crawler chassis...|$|R
25|$|The {{more complex}} double {{differential}} system {{is similar to}} the controlled differential in basic concept, in that it controls the speed of the tracks by controlling the rotation of the idlers. However, in this case two complete differentials are used, one for each <b>track,</b> and the <b>idlers</b> are controlled not by a brake, but a second power shaft, the steering shaft.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Patrol robots can {{be applied}} in many fields, such as {{accident}} prevention and troubleshooting. In this paper, we introduce mechanical design and analysis of a tracked mobile system for patrol robot which solves the occupation problem of motor and gear box in traditional tracked mobile system. The structure of the tracked mobile system includes sprocket constructed by the wheel motor, closed track chain which is meshing with the sprocket and the <b>idler,</b> <b>track</b> shoes and high intensity pins. Finally, finite element analysis is carried out on several key components to verify the rationality of the design...|$|R
5000|$|A {{tracked vehicle}} uses a {{combination}} of wheels and rollers, including drive sprockets, <b>idler</b> wheels, <b>track</b> return rollers and road wheels. It is quite similar in concept to a conveyor belt, only instead of a machine carrying objects {{on top of a}} powered continuous belt, it's a machine that moves itself over a continuous belt. In a typical application, power is transmitted to a drive sprocket (or drive wheel), which drives the track around its loop. On {{the opposite end of the}} vehicle, there is an idler wheel, which provides a pulley wheel of sorts. On some applications, the drive sprocket and idler wheel carry some of the weight of the vehicle, for the purposes of this description, we will assume the drive sprocket and idler wheel are not weight-bearing units, and the drive sprocket is on the front (see M4 Sherman for an example). Since the drive sprocket can be at either the front (M4 Sherman) or the rear (M1 Abrahms) of the vehicle depending on the design, the idler wheel either carries the track back off the ground and returns it to the drive sprocket (rear idler wheel), or receives track from the drive sprocket and lays it down in front of the road wheels (front idler wheel). The idler wheel is not powered, just like an idler gear. Although it technically reverses the tracks direction (but not its rotation), this has nothing to do with the term [...] "idler"; it is not related to an idler gear other than that they are both [...] "idle", or not doing any work, only transmitting power ("idle" [...] being a term for something or someone who isn't working). The road wheels are a series of non-powered wheels between the drive sprocket and idler wheel that serve to support the weight of the vehicle (and thus aren't considered [...] "idle", even though they are unpowered). In higher speed applications, such as tanks and other AFV's, these road wheels are typically given some sort of suspension system to ease the ride, increase controllability, and decrease wear and tear. Due to the complications in adding suspension systems to the idler wheel and, in particular, the drive sprocket, in such vehicles, the road wheels typically carry all of the weight of the vehicle. In low speed applications, such as bulldozers, these road wheels lack any kind of suspension system, as the low speeds don't demand the cushioning. This also allows the idler and drive wheels to carry some of the weight, as their lack of suspension is made irrelevant. Track return rollers may or may not be used, and are simply small rollers which support the weight of the track as it's transferred from rear to front to be laid down again.The track simply provides a solid [...] "road" [...] for the road wheels to roll over on over all surfaces: the road wheels roll the vehicle along the self-created [...] "road", while the drive sprocket forces the vehicle forward along the track and lays down [...] "fresh" [...] <b>track.</b> The <b>idler</b> picks the [...] "used" [...] track back up, and returns it back to the drive sprocket in the front. This is why an early term for a tracked vehicle was a [...] "track-laying machine" [...] (not to be confused with railroad track laying equipment). Transporting vehicles over muddy ground often required planks or logs to be placed along the track (see corduroy road, plank road). In the later 19th century, inventors figured out a way to make a rolling machine that would lay its own plank road wherever it went, negating the need for farmers to lay down logs in order to traverse muddy areas. Other benefits were discovered later.|$|R
