40|$|Abstract: In some {{situations}} the producers desire to maximize total profit of Decision Making Units (DMUs) while the {{inputs and outputs}} prices of DMUs change from one time period to another. In this paper, the researchers develop productivity index when producers are going to maximize total profit {{when the price of}} inputs and outputs are known. The proposed method uses all price information about inputs and outputs for determining productivity index while previous methods use only cost of inputs to determine index of productivity. Therefore, the proposed Mulmquist productivity index in this paper is more precise than the other Mulmquist productivity index. Here, productivity change is decomposed into profit efficiency and <b>profit</b> <b>technical</b> change. Furthermore, <b>profit</b> efficiency change is decomposed into technical and allocative efficiency change and <b>profit</b> <b>technical</b> change into a part capturing shifts of input and output quantities and shifts of input and output prices. These decompositions provide a clearer picture of the root sources of productivity change. Finally, the proposed fractional programming problems are converted to the linear programming problems.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The aim of {{this thesis}} is to conduct a {{thorough}} analysis {{of the performance of}} Australian banks {{over a long period of}} time, covering a period of various regulatory measures. To achieve this aim, the following four objectives are set in this thesis: first, to investigate economic efficiency (i. e. cost and profit efficiency) of the Australian banks before and after the implementation of the prudential regulation; second, to examine whether the Australian banks operate at the minimum efficient scale; third, to assess whether the efficiencies achieved contribute to wealth maximization of shareholders; fourth, to examine the determinants of Australian bank efficiency. Using a data set covering a period from 1985 through 2008, I first apply the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to examine the <b>technical,</b> cost and <b>profit</b> efficiency of Australian banks. A standard data envelopment analysis (DEA), as well as a slack-based DEA model (Tone 2001), is then used to assess the technical and scale efficiency of Australian banks. In addition, a Malmquist index model is used to investigate bank productivity changes over the sample period. The relationship between bank efficiency and bank stock returns is also examined using the market model. Lastly, a mixed two-step approach is used to examine efficiency and the determinants of efficiency using panel data from 1988 to 2008 across three countries, namely, Australia, Canada and the U. K [...] In the first stage, a common efficiency frontier for banks in three countries is constructed including the environmental factors. The firm-level determinants of efficiency are then investigated by regressing these efficiencies on firm-specific factors. A key finding of this thesis is that, over the period from 1985 through 2008, the <b>technical,</b> cost and <b>profit</b> efficiency of Australian banks improved. However, scale efficiency showed a declining trend, which was mainly due to the scale inefficiency of the big-four banks over the sample period. Australian banks have a high level of cost and profit efficiency, but have a relatively low level of technical efficiency. Technological improvement is found to be the major driving force behind productivity changes of Australian banks, and also has a positive effect on the profit efficiency frontier. It is also observed that <b>technical,</b> cost and <b>profit</b> efficiency have a positive effect on bank stock returns, suggesting that bank efficiency is properly recognized by market participants. Compared to their regional counterparts, the big-four banks have a lower level of technical efficiency, but a higher level of cost efficiency. The low level of technical efficiency of the big-four banks is attributed to scale inefficiency. In comparison, the regional banks can achieve the same level of profit efficiency as that of the big-four banks by devising a better way of transforming inputs into outputs. Australian banks show a superior performance in terms of <b>technical,</b> cost and <b>profit</b> efficiency compared with that of Canadian and U. K. banks. The factors such as intangible assets, loans to deposits ratio and, loans to assets ratio exert a positive influence on technical efficiency. On the other hand, technical efficiency is inversely affected by size, ratio of loan loss provisions to total loans and debt to equity ratio. The findings of this thesis appear to provide justifications for the deregulatory measures and the prudential regulation framework introduced by the Australian regulatory bodies. Australian banks with increased efficiency levels and relatively high capital adequacy ratios demonstrated resilience to external shocks, such as the Asian financial crisis and the subprime mortgage crisis. An investigation of the determinants of bank efficiency suggests that an Australian bank manager has the choice of tuning up either the capital structure or the asset structure to improve efficiency. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations relating to data unavailability and efficiency evaluation techniques...|$|R

40|$|Transportation, as {{the service}} of moving {{commodities}} between places, plays a unique role in a fully competitive capitalist space-economy. The commodity of transportation is consumed {{as a part of}} virtually every economic transaction, linking the production and consumption of a commodity; demand for transportation is derived from spatial configurations rather than being fixed by socially necessary techniques and real wages; and the circulation time taken in transportation is a deduction from capitalists' profits. The impact of circulation time on profits may be calculated precisely. The derived nature of the demand for transportation adds a level of uncertainty to the impact of cost-reducing <b>technical</b> change on <b>profit</b> rates. Given this, cost-reducing and time-reducing technical change in the transportation commodity {{is one of the few}} ways of ensuring an increased rate of profit for capitalists, ceteris paribus.

40|$|AbstractTo {{remove the}} {{difficulty}} caused by different profit frontiers in different {{periods of time}} for calculating profit efficiency changes and its components, this paper proposes a circular global profit Malmquist productivity index. This index is applicable when the input costs and output prices are known and when producers seek to maximize the total profit of their decision making units (DMUs). To this end, first, two methods are introduced to obtain the common costs and prices {{with or without the}} decision maker’s preferences, and then, a common profit efficient frontier is obtained. The proposed index can be decomposed into several circular components, viz., profit efficiency change, <b>profit</b> <b>technical</b> change, technical efficiency change, allocative efficiency change, technical change, and cost/price change. The proposed index is then generalised to compare the productivity of two different units at two different points in time. The global profit Malmquist productivity index developed here is unique and is computed using nonparametric linear programming model known as data envelopment analysis (DEA), and {{there is no need to}} resort to the geometric mean in the calculation.

The aim of the paper is a complex evaluation of the influence of subsidy on production, costs, <b>profit</b> and <b>technical</b> efficiency of organic farms.

The main methodological tool for achieving mentioned aims is an analysis using a production and a stochastic frontier production function. This approach has not been used in the Czech Republic yet. The previous studies, analyzed subsidy of organic farming, were based on a comparison of especially family farm income, profit or costs of organic and conventional farming. The analysis was conducted on the basis of unbalanced panel data from 143 organic and 388 conventional enterprises - legal entities, obtained over the time period 2004 - 2008. The sample of organic farms represents 58 % of the entire population of organic legal entities.
