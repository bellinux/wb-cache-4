5|$|The Old Bridge {{is now a}} {{scheduled}} monument and is also depicted in two emblems of local rugby union teams; Pontypridd RFC and Cilfynydd RFC. Artist Lulu Quinn was commissioned by Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> the Old Bridge {{as part of a}} regeneration programme for Pontypridd called the Monument Illumination Scheme. Initial tests <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> the bridge took place on 19 August 2008, and the project was officially launched after successful testing.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} designs for pillbox-like {{structures}} for various purposes including light anti-aircraft positions, observation posts and searchlight positions <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> the shoreline.|$|E

5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was provided}} <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> the new road, {{but for one}} year after the opening the lights were kept switched off following objections from river pilots who argued that they would make it hard to distinguish the navigation lights of shipping and the signal lights on the shore. Eventually the electric lights were turned on at a reduced brilliance.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November 2003, {{the last}} ever Concorde flight (Concorde 216) {{flew over the}} bridge before landing at Filton Aerodrome. In April 2006, the bridge was the centrepiece of the Brunel 200 weekend, celebrating the 200th anniversary {{of the birth of}} Isambard Kingdom Brunel. At the climax of the celebration a {{firework}} display was launched from the bridge. The celebrations also saw the activation of an LED-based lighting array <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Standard US {{tank and}} armored {{infantry}} battalions had a mortar platoon equipped with either M21s or the older M4 MMCs. The M21 was used mainly <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> targets {{at night or}} provide indirect fire support to the infantry. The usage was uncommon because the White Motor Company was only able to produce 110 M21s in 1944.|$|E

5|$|The TSR-2 {{was also}} to be {{equipped}} with a reconnaissance pack in the weapons bay which included an optical linescan unit built by EMI, three cameras and a sideways-looking radar (SLR) in order {{to carry out the}} majority of its reconnaissance tasks. Unlike modern linescan units that use infrared imaging, the TSR-2's linescan would use daylight imaging or an artificial light source <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> the ground for night reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|The beaches {{themselves}} were overlooked by pillboxes of various types. These were sometimes placed low {{down to get}} maximum advantage from enfilading fire whereas others were placed high up making them much harder to capture. Searchlights were installed at the coast <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> the sea surface and the beaches for artillery fire.|$|E
5|$|The three-minute ride {{features}} 32 suspended twin seats (64 seats altogether) {{spinning around}} a central tower.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{assembling}} patterned crystalline arrays of colloidal particles using ultraviolet illumination of an optically-sensitive semiconducting anode while using the anode to apply an electronic {{field to the}} colloidal particles. The ultraviolet illumination increases current density, and consequently, {{the flow of the}} colloidal particles. As a result, colloidal particles can be caused to migrate from non-illuminated areas of the anode <b>to</b> <b>illuminated</b> areas of the anode. Selective illumination of the anode {{can also be used to}} permanently affix colloidal crystals <b>to</b> <b>illuminated</b> areas of the anode while not affixing them to non-illuminated areas of the anode...|$|R

5|$|The urban {{regeneration}} company Clydebank Re-Built started a £3.75m restoration project in 2005, and the crane {{opened to the}} public in August 2007. The structure was shot-blasted to remove old paint and rust, allowing repairs to be undertaken before repainting. A lift for visitors to ascend to the jib and an emergency evacuation stair were installed, along with a wire mesh around the viewing area and floodlights <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> the crane at night.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} {{of any sort}} was largely absent during the industrial development of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Using candles or oil lamps <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> a textile factory was costly, and economically unsound. With the advent of industrial means of production, not only were new textile halls physically larger, but they also had to be lit more brightly {{for longer periods of}} time. Driven by great demand, and made possible through Lavoisier's theoretical work regarding the role of oxygen in combustion, the end of the 18th century saw a continuous series of improvements in lighting technology.|$|E
5|$|Created in 1894 as {{a result}} of {{legislation}} requiring each parish to have its own council, the council presently consists of 13 members and is responsible for a variety aspects of parish life: the general upkeep and maintenance of two recreation grounds, the village green, War Memorial, Community Centre, parish allotments, and (in part) the churchyard. The council also funds floodlights <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> the church. A magazine, the Ditton Gazette, is published on a quarterly basis and is circulated among the households of the parish. In February 2006, the council was awarded Quality Parish Council status.|$|E

5|$|Lacking an infield {{lighting}} system, {{cars were}} driven inside the stadium <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> {{it for the}} last two events of the decathlon. The cycling tandem event, which was held in the dark, was another example of the main venue's lighting issues. After the Games it was used as the English national football stadium, hosting numerous concerts and sporting events, including the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final and the British leg of Live Aid in 1985. It was closed in 2000, and demolished three years later to allow the construction of the new Wembley Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the design}} was further {{modified}} to the Do 17 Z-10 Kauz II, the solid nose now containing an infra-red searchlight for the Spanner Anlage infrared detection system. The infrared lamp {{in the nose}} was used <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> the target while the display unit in the windshield made the reflection visible to the target. The Z-10 was armed with four 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns grouped above the IR light and two 20mm MG FF in the lower nose. The crew could reload the 20mm cannons' drum magazines internally. The Z-10 contained an IR searchlight (Spanner-Anlage) for the Spanner infrared detection system. A single Kauz II was equipped with and tested the Lichtenstein radar.|$|E
5|$|Regardless, {{research}} has continued <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> {{the complexity of}} the lemur mind, with emphasis on the cognitive abilities of the ring-tailed lemur. As early as the mid-1970s, studies had demonstrated that they could be trained through operant conditioning using standard schedules of reinforcement. The species {{has been shown to be}} capable of learning pattern, brightness and object discrimination, skills common among vertebrates. The ring-tailed lemur has also been shown to learn a variety of complex tasks often equaling, if not exceeding, the performance of simians.|$|E

5|$|Scott {{crafted a}} simple battle {{plan for the}} {{expected}} engagement. His ships would steam in column with his destroyers at {{the front and rear}} of his cruiser column, searching across a 300 degree arc with SG surface radar in an effort to gain positional advantage on the approaching enemy force. The destroyers were <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> any targets with searchlights and discharge torpedoes while the cruisers were to open fire at any available targets without awaiting orders. The cruiser's float aircraft, launched in advance, were to find and illuminate the Japanese warships with flares. Although Helena and Boise carried the new, greatly improved SG radar, Scott chose San Francisco as his flagship.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, {{a number}} of A-10 ground-attack {{aircraft}} arrived but {{found it difficult to}} pinpoint enemy targets and began dropping flares <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> the zone. One of these flares landed on a friendly vehicle, and although the vehicle radioed in its position, it was hit by an AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile that killed the entire crew except for the driver. Following the incident, the company was withdrawn and the remaining vehicles reorganized into another nearby company. With observation post 4 cleared, the Iraqi 6th Armored Brigade withdrew over the border to Al-Wafrah under heavy fire from Coalition aircraft. Coalition forces had lost 11 troops to friendly fire and none to enemy action.|$|E
5|$|The role of John Hart in Torchwood {{was written}} with the casting of Marsters in mind after he {{contacted}} the shows' producers expressing {{his interest in}} appearing in the programme's parent show, Doctor Who. The character is used <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> some of Jack's own characteristics as a doppelgänger who provides both an exaggerated version of, and a parallel to, aspects of Jack's persona. Both Marsters and the general media also compared aspects of Hart's character to Marsters's role as Spike in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. Whilst a few reviewers criticised the character in relation to his impact of the show's tone, a larger number welcomed the character and the energy Marsters brought to the role.|$|E
