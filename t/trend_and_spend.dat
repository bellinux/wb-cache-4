Drawing on evidence from systems around the world, but particularly in Britain, we outline the arguments for different types {{of public and private}} provision of pension income and consider how far they go towards meeting the objectives of pension provision.

The authors give a brief textual description of patterns <b>and</b> <b>trends</b> in <b>spending,</b> <b>and</b> provide the raw data and documentation of its sources in the appendix. The data are also provided in an excel spreadsheet on the safety nets website www. worldbank. org/safetynets so that others may use them. Mean spending on safety nets is 1. 9 {{percent of gross domestic product}} (GDP) <b>and</b> median <b>spending</b> is 1. 4 percent of GDP. For about half of the countries, spending falls between 1 and 2 percent of GDP. Some variation is apparent. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Pakistan, and Tajikistan, for example, spend considerably less than 1 percent of GDP, while spending on social safety nets in Ethiopia and Malawi is nearly 4. 5 percent of GDP because international aid is counted, but will be more like 0. 5 percent if only domestically financed spending were counted. Other high-spending countries Mauritius, South Africa, and the Slovak Republic finance their safety nets domestically. Spending on safety nets is less variable than spending on social protection or the social sectors.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "State and local governments work {{in partnership with the}} federal government to implement numerous intergovernmental programs. Fiscal pressures for state and local governments may exist when spending is expected to outpace revenues for the long term. GAO was asked to examine (1) the long-term fiscal pressures facing state and local governments <b>and</b> historical <b>spending</b> <b>and</b> revenue <b>trends,</b> (2) <b>spending</b> <b>and</b> revenue <b>trends</b> to identify patterns among states, and (3) what is known about the implications of these fiscal pressures for federal policies. Using aggregate data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis's National Income and Product Accounts, this analysis draws on results from the March 2010 update to GAO's state and local government fiscal model. GAO's model uses historical data to simulate expenditures and revenues for the sector for the next 50 years. Data from the U. S. Census Bureau are used to analyze patterns of state and local government expenditures and revenues among the states from 1977 to 2007, the most recent 30 -year period for which these data were available. A review of GAO and other reports synthesizes what is known about the implications of these long-term fiscal pressures for future federal policies. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the great}} {{barriers}} to increased student success – meaning not just degree completion but also high quality learning outcomes – lies in the negative funding trends affecting higher education. Across all institutions, prices (tuitions) are increasing even as costs (spending per student) are being cut. Student access and affordability are at risk and so is quality. Examples will be given of recent <b>trends</b> in revenues <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> <b>and</b> projections of where funding is likely {{to go in the}} future, which (no surprise) {{are likely to be more}} of the same. While more can and should be done to make the case for changes in state fiscal policy to put money back into higher education, we can’t wait for new revenues to solve the cost/price problem. Continuous attention to both cost management (reducing <b>spending</b> where possible) <b>and</b> cost effectiveness (putting new money into areas that pay off in quality and learning) will be needed more than ever. To do that, we will need to be very intentional about the relationship between <b>spending</b> <b>and</b> effectiveness. This will require more fiscal literacy from academic decision makers, and more academic literacy among budget officers. This session will discuss what that means in practical terms, using examples of ways to think about cost effectiveness from work on high impact practices, as well as ways to cut budgets that do the least harm to quality and access. The session will conclude with suggestions about near term strategies that can be effective at the institutional level, as well as those that need to be addressed in public policy by states and systems...|$|R

Staffing resources for these areas either largely declined or stagnated however; thus while schools might be spending more on these dimensions, the question is raised of how effectively resources are being distributed.

40|$|While the law {{governing}} {{the electoral process}} has changed dramatically in the past decade, one thing has stayed the same: Courts and commentators continue to view voting in elections <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> on elections through distinct constitutional lenses. On the spending side, First Amendment principles guide judicial analysis, and recent decisions have been strongly deregulatory. On the voting side, courts rely on a makeshift equal protection-oriented framework, and they {{have tended to be}} more accepting of regulation. Key voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> precedents seldom cite each other. Similarly, election law scholars typically address voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> in isolation. This Article challenges the prevailing, bifurcated approach to voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> law. It maintains that the law’s disparate handling of voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> is unjustified. Voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> are, at bottom, two methods of participating in the electoral process.

40|$|Borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> is {{a policy}} with several weaknesses. 1, it {{involves}} government borrowing something, that is money, which government can create in limitless quantities any time. 2, the “borrow” part of borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> is deflationary: {{the opposite of the}} desired effect. 3, borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> may result in interest rate increases and crowding out. To get round this, governments print extra money and buy back government securities. This is a charade: governments here are engaged in “print and spend” while pretending to effect “borrow and spend”. 4, when borrowings are paid back, the initial reflationary effect is reversed, thus borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> does not have a permanent effect, whereas print <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> does. 5, {{one of the ways that}} borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> works is that it supplies the private sector with additional assets (bonds which pay interest). This reduces “paradox of thrift” unemployment. But the private sector actually NEEDS or WANTS these assets, thus there is no need to pay interest to induce the recipients to accept those assets. Put another way, governments should issue zero interest bonds (i. e. cash) not interest paying bonds. 6, Borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> expands the national debt, some of which will be held by foreigners. Paying interest to foreigners when no interest needs to be paid makes even less sense than paying such interest to natives. For the purposes of influencing unemployment and inflation, print <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> is a superior policy to adjusting interest rates because the latter is distortionary. ...|$|R

Summary Government expenditure on schools {{has more than}} doubled in real terms in the last 25 years, while student numbers have only grown by 18 %. Funding for school education was 3. 1 % of GDP in 2012 – 13, and is projected to reach 3. 4 % by 2025 under current predictions of economic growth. Large increases in real per-student expenditure have not been accompanied by improved student achievement, {{and there is no reason}} to expect future funding increases will have a beneficial impact at the system level. There are both budgetary and educational reasons to review present and future funding for schools.
