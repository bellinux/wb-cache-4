5|$|In 1949, the Board of Transportation {{issued a}} $504,000,000 plan to {{increase}} capacity on several subway lines {{through the construction of}} a new <b>trunk</b> <b>line</b> under Second Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The next {{electrification}} {{occurred on}} the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> from OsloØ to Lillestrøm on 1 September 1927, the Randsfjord Line from Drammen to Kongsberg on 10 April 1929 and the Drammen Line from Drammen to Brakerøya on 6 May 1930. El 5 locomotives were acquired for the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line.</b> Electric multiple units were put into service in 1931, with the delivery of four Class 62 units on the route from OsloV to Sandvika. These proved not to be sufficiently powerful for the large traffic and were later moved to less used services from OsloV to Asker or Heggedal. The class remained on the commuter rail service until 1953.|$|E

50|$|<b>Trunk</b> <b>lines</b> {{are used}} for {{connecting}} a private branch exchange (PBX) to a telephone service provider. When needed {{they can be used}} by any telephone connected to the PBX, while the station lines to the extensions serve only one station telephones. Trunking saves cost, because there are usually fewer <b>trunk</b> <b>lines</b> than extension lines, since it is unusual in most offices to have all extension lines in use for external calls at once. <b>Trunk</b> <b>lines</b> transmit voice and data in formats such as analog, T1, E1, ISDN or PRI. The dial tone lines for outgoing calls are called DDCO (Direct Dial Central Office) trunks.|$|R
5|$|In 1903 and 1904, the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> was {{upgraded}} to double track. The section from Drammen to Kongsberg was converted to standard gauge on 1 November 1909. Between 1917 and 1920, dual gauge was laid between OsloV and Drammen, and from 13 November 1922, the Drammen Line was entirely operated with standard gauge. The first electrification of NSB's lines {{was put into}} service on 26 October 1922 on the Drammen Line between OsloV and Brakerøya. The section from OsloV to Sandvika was {{upgraded to}} double track on 26 November 1922. From 1922, NSB introduced El 1-hauled passenger trains on the Drammen Line, and later other lines.|$|E
5|$|Several of the area's coastal {{settlements}} have {{facilities for}} small boats, but generally only fishing and holiday craft use them; no regular passenger or freight-boat service {{runs to the}} Catlins. A railway line, the Catlins River Branch, linked the area with the South Island Main <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> from the late 19th century. Construction of this line began in 1879, {{but it did not}} reach Owaka until 1896. Construction progressed slowly due to the difficult terrain, and the final terminus of the line at Tahakopa was not completed until 1915.|$|E
5|$|The {{first part}} of what is now the Oslo Commuter Rail was the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line,</b> which opened on 1 September 1854 between Oslo East Station (OsloØ, located at the same place as the current OsloS), and Eidsvoll. The line was at first private, {{although}} it was nationalized in 1926. On 3 October 1862, the Kongsvinger Line opened from Lillestrøm to Kongsvinger. The Østfold Line opened from OsloØ to Moss and onwards to Halden on 2 January 1879, followed by the Eastern Østfold Line from Ski via Mysen to Sarpsborg on 24 November 1882.|$|E

5|$|When the {{new airport}} opened on 8 October 1998 the Flytoget airport express trains started {{operating}} immediately, as did the Gardermoen Line from Lillestrøm {{to the airport and}} onwards to Eidsvoll. Because the tunnel was not finished, trains were required to use the old <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> from Oslo Central Station to Lillestrøm. After this diversion the express trains switched to the completed section of the new Gardermoen Line between Lillestrøm and Oslo Airport. Regular operations using the Romerike Tunnel started on 22 August 1999.|$|E
5|$|An inter-municipal railway {{committee}} {{was established in}} 1941. Led by Sigval Bergesen, it considered the possibility of extending the Ålgård Line towards Hunnedalen via Setesdalsheiene to Lunde in Telemark. The line would be built with a higher standard than the Sørlandet Line and have a shorter route, allowing travel time from Stavanger to Oslo to be reduced to four to five hours. A detailed plan was made for the extension from Ålgård to the county border with Telemark. To consider the proposal, parliament established a committee in 1949 {{to look at the}} various proposals. After considering the impact and value of the various railways that had been proposed in the 1940s, it recommended not building the Inner <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line,</b> as the expansion had been christened.|$|E
5|$|In May 1922, John Hylan {{launched}} a new plan for the freight and passenger tunnel, and the Board of Estimate recommended that $4,080,000 be initially appropriated for the project. The Transit Commission and the Port Authority {{refused to accept the}} plan, as they each had their own plans. This plan was much less extensive than the original plan. The original plan would have had the tunnel from Owl's Head Park under the Narrows to Staten Island, and then continuing to a freight yard to be built in the center of Staten Island, from which a <b>trunk</b> <b>line</b> would run across the Arthur Kill to New Jersey as far as Paterson, before merging with the West Shore Railroad. The new revised plan would only cover the Narrows Tunnel, and a three-mile spur to Arlington Yard.|$|E

5|$|On 15 June 1953, the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> from Lillestrøm to Eidsvoll took {{electrification}} into use. Further upgrades on the Drammen Line installing {{double track}} {{were put into}} service on 24 July 1953 from Billingstad to Hvalstad, on 29 November 1955 from Hvalstad to Asker and on 9 November 1958 from Sandvika to Billingstad. Between 1953 and 1955, NSB took delivery of 18 Class 67 multiple units. While visually similar to Class 65, they had improved technology and reliability. On 1 February 1961, the Gjøvik Line from OsloØ to Tøyen was put into service with double track and the line from OsloØ to Jaren put into service as electrified. Double track from Tøyen to Grefsen opened on 27 May 1962 and the sections from Jaren to Gjøvik was electrified in 1963.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian State Railways serves Lysaker Station {{both with}} Oslo Commuter Rail trains {{as well as}} {{regional}} trains. Up to five daily express trains along the Sørlandet Line and the stop at Lysaker. It also serves an hourly headway of the R10 regional trains from the Drammen Line and Dovre Line. There are five hourly trains heading to Asker via the Asker Line, including the L12, L13 and L14. Westwards L12 runs to Kongsberg while they eastwards serve the Gardermoen Line, <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> and the Kongsvinger Line. L1, a full-stop service on the Trunk- and Drammen Line, runs every thirty minutes. A rush-hour service line L2x, serving the Østfold Line, also serves Lysaker.|$|E
5|$|The {{segment of}} the Third Avenue El in the Bronx would be {{demolished}} and replaced with a new subway line under Park Avenue, parallel to the New Haven Line Metro-North tracks. The Park Avenue Subway would connect with the Second Avenue <b>trunk</b> <b>line</b> in the South Bronx, where trains from Park Avenue would merge onto the same tracks as trains from the Dyre Avenue and Pelham spurs. In the same borough, the MCTA would also extend the then now-IND Pelham Line to Co-op City. It would also lengthen the IND Concourse Line to White Plains Road, with {{a connection to the}} IRT White Plains Road Line at either Burke Avenue or Gun Hill Road.|$|E

5|$|The system's {{predecessors}} {{date back}} to the opening of the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> in 1854. By 1902, all the routes used by the present commuter rail had been taken into service. Electrification started in 1922, and Class 62 EMUs were introduced in 1931, followed by Class 65 units in 1936 and Class 67 in 1953. Electrification was completed in 1963. In 1980, the Drammen Line was connected {{to the rest of the}} system and all trains started operating to the new OsloS. The high-speed Gardermoen Line opened in 1998. In 2013, new Stadler FLIRT units were taken into traffic, and the Asker Line was completed just before. By 2018, the Follo Line is scheduled to open.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, the New York City Subway {{experienced}} {{a surge in}} ridership. By 1920, 1.3 billion annual passengers were riding the subway, compared to 523 million annual riders just seven years before the war. In 1919, the New York Public Service Commission launched a study {{at the behest of}} engineer Daniel L. Turner to determine what improvements were needed in the city's public transport system. Turner's final paper, titled Proposed Comprehensive Rapid Transit System, was a massive plan calling for new routes under almost every north-south Manhattan avenue, extensions to lines in Brooklyn and Queens, and several crossings of the Narrows to Staten Island. Among the plans were was a massive <b>trunk</b> <b>line</b> under Second Avenue consisting of at least six tracks and numerous branches throughout Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx; in turn, the Second and Third Avenue elevated lines were to be knocked down {{to make room for the}} 6-track subway. The paper was revised in January 1927.|$|E
5|$|The {{state highway}} system was created on May 13, 1913, {{with the passage}} of the State Reward <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> Highway Act. The state {{originally}} signposted these highways by July 1, 1919, and the roadways that make up Bus. M-28 were originally a portion of M-15. Later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, the highway was redesignated as a part of US41 and part of M-28. The main highway was moved with the construction of a northerly bypass of Ishpeming and Negaunee in 1937. The business loop was not designated Bus. M-28 permanently and marked on state maps until 1958. It was designated US41A/M-28A before being redesignated ALT US41/ALT M-28. or Bus. US41/Bus. M-28. This dual designation later was mirrored by the other Marquette County business route, Bus. US41. Occasionally, more recent maps use this older numbering to label the highway.|$|E
