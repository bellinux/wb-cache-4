5|$|An {{alternate}} {{video was}} shot for the song's remix. It too {{was directed by}} Carey, and was shot in black and white. The shot of Carey in a beret that would become the cover for this single is a scene from <b>the</b> <b>video.</b> <b>The</b> <b>video</b> features cameo appearances by Da Brat and Xscape. It begins with Carey and the duo spending time recording the song in Carey's in-home studio. In <b>the</b> <b>video,</b> Carey is wearing a large white, straw hat and features long golden hair. As the trio finishes the song, scenes of Carey by her pool are shown, with cameos made by her dog, Jack. Brat and Xscape are seen poolside with Carey, playing cards and drinking beer, as the trio further bond and laugh. Towards the end of <b>the</b> <b>video,</b> scenes of the trio in the studio are shows, and intermingled with snippets of Carey walking inside her mansion, shared with then husband Tommy Mottola. <b>The</b> <b>video</b> ends with Carey and Brat bonding by the studio and pool.|$|E
5|$|An edited {{version of}} <b>the</b> <b>video</b> was {{produced}} for the Spanglish {{version of the}} song, in which Ne-Yo's scenes are cut and replaced with scenes featuring David Bisbal. The Spanglish version of <b>the</b> <b>video</b> shows Bisbal watching the scenes of Rihanna on film being projected while he sings the song's lyrics.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{understand}} the meanings associated bodily practices in <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> of <b>the</b> festival OLYMPIKUS. MOV, and also analyze the reception/interaction Internet users on these <b>videos.</b> <b>The</b> methodology consisted the description of <b>the</b> <b>videos,</b> <b>the</b> selection of comments and further analysis based on the notion of dialogic language of Mikhail Bakhtin and the types of decoding Stuart Hall. We concluded that there was a large range of bodily practices and meanings related to them in <b>the</b> <b>videos.</b> Reception/interaction Internet provides a critical dialogue, congratulation, and suggestive questioning on <b>the</b> <b>videos...</b>|$|R

40|$|This session {{includes}} {{the responses to}} <b>the</b> contrast <b>video</b> stimuli in <b>the</b> first experiment. Participants were shown <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> and asked to describe to another person (who could not see <b>the</b> <b>videos)</b> what they saw. This experiment includes two temporal arrangements: sequential and separate. <b>The</b> <b>videos</b> were shown {{one by one and}} took up the entire screen (<b>the</b> two <b>videos</b> that make up the separate arrangement were played as one <b>video).</b> <b>The</b> stimuli were divided over two lists, one for the separate arrangement (s 1) and one for the sequential arrangement (s 2) ...|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>videos</b> were encoded {{with the}} x 264 encoder [36], random packet losses were {{inserted}} using a packet loss simulator [37] and <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> were decoded with the ffmpeg decoder. The ffmpeg decoder produces incomplete video files when random packet losses are inserted. To {{be able to}} apply the VQM metric, <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> were reconstructed so {{that they have the}} same length as the original. The reconstruction was done in two steps. First, the frame numbers were inserted into the luminance information of the uncompressed original sequence. After decoding <b>the</b> <b>videos,</b> <b>the</b> frame numbers were read and used to identify the missing frames and reconstruct <b>the</b> decoded <b>video.</b> <b>The</b> reconstruction method is explained in detail in [38].|$|R

5|$|Overheating {{caused by}} the lack of space between <b>the</b> <b>video</b> cards forces {{researchers}} using the FASTRA II to keep the side panel door open, so that <b>the</b> <b>video</b> cards can get regular air, decreasing the overall temperature inside the case.|$|E
30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that {{students}} had negative descriptions about the nature of <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> they watched in relation to their Research Methods course. Almost all the participants indicated that they had one issue or the other with the content and the format of all <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> they watched. With regard to the content, the students’ comments suggest that <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> should have a different or modified approach than what they experienced. We suggest that to improve the content of <b>the</b> <b>videos,</b> it should depict authentic human behavior rather than scripted behaviour. <b>The</b> <b>videos</b> should be interactive and lively in nature. Also, we suggest that to make the content of these <b>videos</b> different from <b>the</b> traditional classroom period, there should be practice sessions in <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> which should be followed up with a thorough discussion during the actual class period.|$|R

Directed by Michael Sauer Christensen, {{it is set}} in an eerie, empty house that is reminiscent of a horror film, where a black cloud wanders through {{the halls of the}} house. The members wear black and gray clothing in <b>the</b> <b>video,</b> with Nystrom's costume gradually changing throughout. <b>The</b> <b>video</b> ends by the members exiting the house through the roof and transforming into a beam of light shooting into the sky. <b>The</b> <b>video</b> uses a shortened radio edit of the original song, omitting the bridge.|$|E

5|$|The British {{television}} {{premiere of}} <b>the</b> <b>video</b> was extremely controversial. <b>The</b> <b>video</b> {{had not been}} ready when the track debuted in the UK singles chart. By {{the time it was}} finalised, the track had dropped in the chart. McCartney flew to London to premiere <b>the</b> <b>video</b> on the BBC1 TV show Top Of The Pops, but the show had a strict policy that no single that had dropped in position could feature on the programme and refused to show it. A furious argument ensued, with claims McCartney threatened to withdraw all his music from the corporation. As a compromise, the BBC offered to air <b>the</b> <b>video</b> two days later on The Late, Late Breakfast Show hosted by Noel Edmonds, a variety show that featured live music performances, but rarely aired videos. They agreed to show it on the programme only if McCartney appeared live and gave an interview. He reluctantly agreed and appeared with his wife Linda live on the show on Saturday, 29 October 1983; his first live UK TV appearance since 1973. The interview was stilted and the McCartneys made little or no effort to answer any of Edmonds' questions. After some reportedly hostile negotiations, the programme's entire show was built around the 'medicine men' theme of <b>the</b> <b>video</b> and the guest who had been booked to appear that week Olivia Newton John had to agree to appear to promote <b>the</b> <b>video</b> in a skit, reportedly against her will and she expressed anger at having her 'starring' role in the show downgraded into a lesser guest spot to make way for <b>the</b> <b>video</b> and McCartney. The airing of <b>the</b> <b>video</b> on this highly rated show was successful as the track climbed back up the chart the following week and aired on Top Of The Pops on Thursday, 4 November 1983.|$|E
5|$|The boy's {{mother said}} that <b>the</b> <b>video</b> {{had helped him}} {{to deal with his}} depression. After {{watching}} Capaldi's message, Ross Goodall stated that his son's behaviour patterns changed markedly. This change included the ability to comfort his sister and step out of his day-to-day routine. Ross Goodall said that after watching <b>the</b> <b>video,</b> his son smiled {{for the first time since}} his grandmother's death. The family framed the letter from Capaldi that came before <b>the</b> <b>video</b> message, and Ross Goodall said that Thomas looked at it when he felt distressed.|$|E
5|$|The family {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>video</b> from Capaldi on 3 November 2014. After viewing <b>the</b> <b>video,</b> Thomas felt {{encouraged to}} attend his grandmother's funeral. In {{an interview with}} The Guardian, Ross Goodall explained that Capaldi's mention of sadness resonated with the child due to his experience of grief over his grandmother's death. He discussed {{the manner in which}} Thomas perceived emotions as a strict dichotomy between positive and negative without a middle ground. Thomas interpreted from <b>the</b> <b>video</b> that it was all right to feel happy while simultaneously acknowledging that a sad event had occurred. Ross Goodall told The Guardian that before viewing <b>the</b> <b>video</b> from Capaldi, his son had not wanted to attend the funeral.|$|E
