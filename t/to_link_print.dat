Virgil had been {{appointed}} Tombstone's town marshal (i.e., chief of police) on June 6, 1881, after Ben Sippy abandoned the job. However, Virgil {{at the same time}} continued to hold his position of deputy U.S. marshal, and it was in this federal capacity that he continued to chase robbers of stage coaches outside Tombstone city limits. At the scene of the holdup, Wyatt discovered an unusual boot print left by someone wearing a custom-repaired boot heel. The Earps checked a shoe repair shop in Bisbee known to provide widened boot heels and were able <b>to</b> <b>link</b> the boot <b>print</b> <b>to</b> Stilwell.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, the Forum of Bible Agencies International set out {{to create}} an Internet catalog of the world's Bibles. However, it wasn't until 2006 that the Forum was able to {{accomplish}} this goal and launched Find-a-Bible, a web directory providing <b>links</b> <b>to</b> Bibles and biblical resources in the 6000+ languages of the world. The Find-A-Bible directory primarily consists of content created {{by members of the}} Forum of Bible Agencies International and contains <b>links</b> <b>to</b> <b>print</b> Bibles, print-on-demand Bibles, digital Bibles, audio Bibles, visual Bibles and Bible resources in multiple formats.

The Earps checked a shoe repair shop in Bisbee known to provide widened boot heels, and were able <b>to</b> <b>link</b> the boot <b>print</b> <b>to</b> Frank Stilwell. Stilwell had just arrived in Bisbee with Spence, his livery stable partner, and Virgil and Wyatt arrested both of them at the stable, for the stage robbery, on September 10. Cowboy friends provided Stilwell and Spence with an alibi, saying they were elsewhere during the robbery, and the state robbery charges were dropped.|$|R

The masked bandits robbed {{all of the}} passengers of their valuables and the strongbox of about $2,500. During the robbery, the driver heard one of the robbers describe the money as [...] "sugar", a phrase known {{to be used by}} Frank. Wyatt and Virgil Earp rode with the sheriff's posse attempting to track the robbers. At the scene of the holdup, Wells, Fargo & Co. undercover agent Fred Dodge discovered an unusual boot print left by someone wearing a custom-repaired boot heel.

40|$|The "Spill de la vida religiosa" is an {{anonymous}} spiritual treatise written {{at the beginning}} of the 16 th century.

In the critical debate concerning the authorship of the work, and particularly concerning the shortened version that was published, several arguments have been put forward which fail to fully acknowledge the common procedures of the editorial processes during the 16 th century. This article reviews the relationship between this text and the printing press and documents the traditions in the transmission of other works during the same period by analyzing the Catalan and earlier European editions (in this case, the Italian ones). This analysis excludes the possibility that the 'editio princeps' of the "Spill" was not a Franciscan editorial project; it also sheds light on the spiritual contexts that allowed a wirde distribution in Italy and shows that these contexts are <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the company of the Love of God and the Theatine order...|$|R

Users often, perhaps subconsciously, know the strengths of print and web and use the media suitable for their needs accordingly. With a user-centered design approach, it’s possible to create new and enticing hybrid media products for user communities with very different backgrounds...|$|R
50|$|The {{fortunes}} of the commercial envelope manufacturing industry and the postal service go hand in hand, and both <b>link</b> <b>to</b> the <b>printing</b> industry and the mechanized envelope processing industry producing equipments such as franking and addressing machines. They are all four symbiotic: technological developments affecting one obviously ricochet through the others: addressing machines print addresses, postage stamps are a print product, franking machines imprint a frank on an envelope. If fewer envelopes are required; fewer stamps are required; fewer franking machines are required and fewer addressing machines are required. For example, the advent and adoption of information-based indicia (IBI) (commonly referred to as digitally-encoded electronic stamps or digital indicia) by the US Postal Service in 1998 caused widespread consternation in the franking machine industry, as their equipments were effectively rendered obsolescent and resulted {{in a flurry of}} lawsuits involving Pitney Bowes among others. The advent of e-mail in the late 1990s appeared to offer a substantial threat to the postal service. By 2008 letter-post service operators were reporting significantly smaller volumes of letter-post, specifically stamped envelopes, which they attributed mainly to replacement by e-mail. Although a corresponding reduction in the volume of envelopes required would have been expected, no such decrease was reported as widely as the reduction in letter-post volumes.|$|R
