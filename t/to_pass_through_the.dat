5|$|According to Transport for London (TfL), {{the station}} is at {{capacity}} {{because of the large}} number of passengers leaving and entering the station, as well as the large numbers of passengers changing between lines. Currently, everyone who uses the station has <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> intermediate concourse {{at the bottom of the}} main escalators. This causes congestion and delays.|$|E
5|$|The book {{begins with}} Arthur Penhaligon and Leaf {{attempting}} {{to return to}} Earth after their adventures in the Border Sea. While Leaf is able <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> front door and return to Earth, {{the presence of a}} Nithling duplicate of Arthur prevents him from doing so, and he is forced to remain in the Lower House.|$|E

5|$|The longitudes of {{physical}} features on Venus are expressed relative to its prime meridian. The original prime meridian {{passed through the}} radar-bright spot at {{the centre of the}} oval feature Eve, located south of Alpha Regio. After the Venera missions were completed, the prime meridian was redefined <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> central peak in the crater Ariadne.|$|E
5|$|A {{pregnant}} woman's elevated {{blood lead}} level can lead to miscarriage, prematurity, low birth weight, and problems with development during childhood. Lead is able <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> placenta and into breast milk, and {{blood lead level}}s in mothers and infants are usually similar. A fetus may be poisoned in utero if lead from the mother's bones is subsequently mobilized by the changes in metabolism due to pregnancy; increased calcium intake in pregnancy may help mitigate this phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|An X-ray of {{swallowed}} barium {{may be used}} {{to reveal}} {{the size and shape of}} the esophagus, and the presence of any masses. The esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into the esophagus, in a procedure called an endoscopy. If an endoscopy is used on the stomach, the camera will also have <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> esophagus. During an endoscopy, a biopsy may be taken. If cancer of the esophagus is being investigated, other methods, including a CT scan, may also be used.|$|E
50|$|The town is in {{the east}} of the {{locality}}. The Cloncurry Duchess Road <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> locality from south <b>to</b> east, <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> town.

5|$|August 23, 2000– The National Hurricane Center {{forecasts}} Hurricane Debby <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Florida Keys as a Category 2 hurricane, {{with one}} computer model predicting a Category4 hurricane in the area. This results in officials declaring a mandatory evacuation for all non-residents in the keys, causing a significant loss of tourism revenue for Monroe County. Debby dissipates {{before hitting the}} area, though its remnants produce heavy rainfall across southern Florida.|$|E
5|$|Early in its life, Debby was {{forecast}} <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> southern Cape Verde islands as {{a tropical}} storm, potentially causing life-threatening flooding. Most computer models consistently predicted Debby to track {{to the northwest}} throughout its lifetime, though intensity was more problematic for forecasters. The National Hurricane Center continually predicted Debby to intensify to hurricane status, though strong vertical shear ultimately prevented the storm from becoming a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Proteins can be informally {{divided into}} three main classes, which {{correlate}} with typical tertiary structures: globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and membrane proteins. Almost all globular proteins are soluble and many are enzymes. Fibrous proteins are often structural, such as collagen, the major component of connective tissue, or keratin, the protein component of hair and nails. Membrane proteins often serve as receptors or provide channels for polar or charged molecules <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> cell membrane.|$|E

50|$|The station {{closed in}} 1965, but the signal box here remains open as it {{controls}} the line towards , which becomes single track {{at this point}} prior <b>to</b> <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> tunnels at Colwall and Ledbury. Trains terminating at Great Malvern also run here to reverse before returning east.|$|R
5|$|Spores of S.thiersii {{are white}} and roughly spherical. They measure {{approximately}} 7.8 – 9.8 by 7.3 – 9.0µm and are amyloid. In an analysis, both monokaryotic (one nucleus per cell) and dikaryotic (two nuclei per cell) strains were isolated from fruit bodies. All the spores {{were found to}} be binucleate but the researchers believed that in the monokaryotic strain, the second nucleus had failed <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> germ tube.|$|E
5|$|The 8th Brigade {{continued}} their advance without interruption to Jinsafut, which was occupied in the evening. The 1st Battalion, Connaught Rangers (7th Brigade) were ordered <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> 8th Brigade and capture the road junction northeast of El Funduq. Here they captured an artillery column of five field guns, horses, wagons and prisoners {{which had been}} held up by fire from the 9th Brigade.|$|E
5|$|The FBB {{closed the}} Security Zone checkpoints, {{but by then}} Stauffenberg's car had been let through two of them {{as he left the}} area. Contrary to the imposed {{security}} doctrines in place, Stauffenberg and his adjutant were able <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> closed Security Zone 3 checkpoint and proceed to the airport for the flight to Berlin. They succeeded in getting away before clarity of the events could be established by the military and security personnel at the Wolf's Lair complex.|$|E

5|$|The Seneca allowed {{very few}} {{travelers}} <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> area and kept non-native settlement to a minimum. The French and Indian War (1754–1763) {{led to the}} migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin, and more departed after the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). The United States acquired the Last Purchase, including what is now Cherry Springs State Park, from the Iroquois in the second Treaty of Fort Stanwix in October 1784. In the years that followed, Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|The eye of Hurricane Katrina was {{forecast}} <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> city of New Orleans. In that event, {{the wind}} was predicted {{to come from the}} north as the storm passed, forcing large volumes of water from Lake Pontchartrain against the levees and possibly into the city. It was also forecast that the storm surge in Lake Pontchartrain would reach , with waves reaching 7feet (2m) above the storm surge.|$|E
5|$|The three cruisers {{were able}} <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> line of drifters, and at 03:30 began attacking the small barrage ships. The Austro-Hungarians {{frequently}} gave the drifter crews warning to abandon ship before opening fire. In some instances, the drifter crews chose to fight: Gowan Lee returned {{fire on the}} Austo-Hungarian ships. The ship was heavily damaged, but remained afloat; her captain—Joseph Watt—was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the battle.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{completing}} her Ph.D., Kelsey {{joined the}} University of Chicago faculty. In 1942, {{like many other}} pharmacologists, Kelsey {{was looking for a}} synthetic cure for malaria. As a result of these studies, Kelsey learned that some drugs are able <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> placental barrier. While there she also met fellow faculty member Dr. Fremont Ellis Kelsey, whom she married in 1943.|$|E
5|$|With {{facilities}} {{prepared in}} Jakarta, Singapore, Bangkok, Saigon, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Kobe, the fledgling Shell company {{was ready to}} become Standard Oil's first challenger in the Asian market. On August 24, 1892, Murex became the first tanker <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Suez Canal. By the time Shell merged with Royal Dutch Petroleum in 1907, the company had 34 steam-driven oil tankers, compared to Standard Oil's four case-oil steamers and 16 sailing tankers.|$|E
5|$|After a {{temporary}} closure between October 1951 and January 1952, British Railways (the {{successor to the}} LNER) ended passenger services between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace permanently on 3 July 1954. British Rail freight traffic continued <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> station until 1964. After freight traffic ceased, the line continued {{to be used for}} occasional London Underground rolling stock transfers between Highgate depot and the Northern City line, with the stock being pulled over the unelectrified lines by battery locomotives. This ceased in 1970 because of the poor condition of some of the intermediate bridges, and the track was lifted through the surface platforms in 1972.|$|E
