Telomere sequences vary from species to species, but, in general, one strand is rich in G with fewer Cs.

Deacetylation of histones stabilizes tightly coiled nucleosomes, inhibiting RNA polymerase access. In addition to acetylation patterns of histones, methylation patterns at promoter regions of DNA can regulate RNA polymerase access to a given <b>template.</b> <b>RNA</b> polymerase is often incapable of synthesizing a primary transcript if the targeted gene's promoter region contains specific methylated cytosines— residues that hinder binding of transcription-activating factors and recruit other enzymes to stabilize a tightly bound nucleosome structure, excluding access to RNA polymerase and preventing the production of primary transcripts.|$|E

This suggests that hPINX1 may have functionally separable cellular effects in which the N terminus is involved in RNA processing via the G-patch, and the C terminus is involved in telomere dynamics.” It is suggested that “PINX1 represses telomerase activity in vivo by binding to the assembled hTERT-hTR complex.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Biosynthesis of msDNA is {{purported to}} follow a unique pathway found nowhere else in DNA/RNA biochemistry. Because of the {{similarity}} of the 2'-5' branch junction to the branch junctions found in RNA splicing intermediates, it might at first have been expected that branch formation would be via spliceosome- or ribozyme-mediated ligation. Surprisingly, however, experiments in cell-free systems using purified retron reverse transcriptase indicate that cDNA synthesis is directly primed from the 2'-OH group of the specific internal G residue of the primer RNA. The RT recognizes specific stem-loop structures in the precursor RNA, rendering synthesis of msDNA by the RT highly specific to its own retron. The priming of msDNA synthesis offers a fascinating challenge {{to our understanding of}} DNA synthesis. DNA polymerases (which include RT) share highly conserved structural features, which means that their active catalytic sites vary little from species to species, or even between DNA polymerases using DNA as a template, versus DNA polymerases using RNA as a template. The catalytic region of eukaryotic reverse transcriptase comprises three domains termed the [...] "fingers", [...] "palm", and [...] "thumb" [...] which hold the double-stranded primer-template in a right-hand grip with the 3'-OH of the primer buried in the active site of the polymerase, a cluster of highly conserved acidic and polar residues situated on the palm between what would be the index and middle fingers. In eukaryotic RTs, the RNase H domain lies on the wrist below the base of the thumb, but retron RTs lack RNase H activity. The nucleic acid binding cleft, extending from the polymerase active site to the RNase H active site, is about 60 Å in length in eukaryotic RTs, corresponding to nearly two helical turns. When eukaryotic RT extends a conventional primer, the growing DNA/RNA double helix spirals along the cleft, and as the double helix passes the RNase H domain, the <b>template</b> <b>RNA</b> is digested to release the nascent strand of cDNA. In the case of msDNA primer extension, however, a long strand of RNA remains attached to the 3'-OH of the priming G. Although it is possible to model an RT-primer template complex which would make the 2'-OH accessible for the priming reaction, further extension of the DNA strand presents a problem: as DNA synthesis progresses, the bulky RNA strand extending from the 3'-OH needs somehow to spiral down the binding cleft without being blocked by steric hindrance. To overcome this issue, the msDNA reverse transcriptase clearly would require special features not shared by other RTs.|$|E

In addition, a P 123 polyprotein containing a mutation in the nsP 2 protease which increased the efficiency of processing exhibited very little, if any, replicase activity. These results provide further evidence that processing of the polyprotein inactivates the minus-strand initiation complex.

40|$|Chloramphenicol can inhibit protein {{synthesis}} in mammalian cell-free systems {{as effectively as}} it inhibits {{protein synthesis}} in analogous microbial systems. Significant inhibition in mammalian systems was obtained only when protein synthesis was stimulated {{by the addition of}} <b>template</b> <b>RNA</b> to the system, there being comparatively little inhibition of protein synthesis by ribosomes in the absence of stimulatory RNA.

The apparent discrepancy in the sensitivity of mammalian and microbial cells to chloramphenicol may be related to differences in turnover or stability of ribosomal <b>template</b> <b>RNA</b> rather than to intrinsic differences in mechanism of protein synthesis. These observations are in accord with the suggestion that protein synthesis in intact mammalian cells may be susceptible to chloramphenicol inhibition only at the time that new messenger or <b>template</b> <b>RNA</b> is being deposited on ribosomes and that more mature cells may be resistant because informative RNA already deposited on ribosomes is not accessible to chloramphenicol inhibition.

In the host factor-dependent reaction, the largest product RNA synthesized by the polymerase was {{twice the size}} of the <b>template</b> <b>RNA.</b> About half of the product RNA recovered from this reaction was shown to exist {{in the form of a}} snapback sequence. Time-course reactions and pulse-chase experiments showed that the product RNA was only slightly larger than the <b>template</b> <b>RNA</b> at early reaction times and that with time it increased in size to form the dimer-sized product RNA. Inhibition of the elongation reaction by adding only [alpha- 32 P]UTP and ATP resulted in the formation of template-sized product RNA. The dimer-sized product RNA was unaffected by phenol extraction or proteinase K treatment but was converted to template-sized molecules by S 1 nuclease.

The synthesis of these transcripts, or template RNAs, requires: unprimed initiation rather than the capped RNA-primed initiation used during viral mRNA synthesis, and antitermination at the polyadenylylation site used during mRNA synthesis. To determine the mechanism of <b>template</b> <b>RNA</b> synthesis, we prepared nuclear extracts from infected cells that were active in the synthesis of both template RNAs and viral mRNAs. By providing the dinucleotide ApG as primer, we circumvented the inefficient unprimed initiation catalyzed by these extracts and, as a consequence, were able to focus on the antitermination step. Antitermination, and hence <b>template</b> <b>RNA</b> synthesis, occurred when ApG but not a capped RNA was used as primer, indicating that the presence of a 5 ' capped end blocked antitermination at the 3 ' end of the transcript. Ultracentrifugation of the nuclear extract yielded a pellet fraction that contained viral nucleocapsids active in viral mRNA synthesis but not <b>template</b> <b>RNA</b> synthesis and a supernatant fraction that contained the antitermination factor. When the supernatant, which had essentially no activity by itself, was added to the pellet in the presence of ApG, <b>template</b> <b>RNA</b> synthesis was restored.
