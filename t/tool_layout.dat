40|$|MODELING LOT ROUTING SOFTWARE THROUGH DISCRETE-EVENT SIMULATION Intel has {{recently}} developed lot routing tools that can theoretically minimize local and overall lot movement. These developments {{were required to}} maximize the flexibility of existing AMHS and minimize {{the time needed to}} retrieve lots for processing. In order to gain insight of how these lot routing rules impact manufacturing, and how they should be configured, Intel uses two different analysis tools. A static spreadsheet model was used to determine the impact of the new lot routing rules in terms of AMHS lot movement volume. The second level of analysis was to use dynamic discreteevent simulation to determine the impact to AMHS and equipment utilization. Both methods were used to determine how tool policy rules should be set for each operation in the process flow, and minimize impact to AMHS and enhance performance, while meeting manufacturing requirements. The static model analysis showed that ideal use of the lot routing algorithm had a very significant impact on AMHS transport requirements. The dynamic discreteevent modeling showed that the lot routing policies can be modified to enhance system performance. These modifications resulted in key learnings about configuring the lot routing software. 1 PROBLEM STATEMENT Due to increasing complexity of Intel’s lot routing algorithms, Intel’s current material handling simulation models must include new functionality. Intel must develop multiple new simulation techniques to determine the impact of lot routing rules on Automated Material Handling Systems (AMHS) within wafer fabrication factories, and determine how to configure these rules based on tool sets, various operations, and <b>tool</b> <b>layout...</b>|$|E

The {{subject matter of the}} study is the current planning of objects survey on the underlying surface in order to increase the effectiveness of sensing system due to the rational use of its resources. Method. New concept of a group object, stochastic swath and stochastic length of the route is introduced. The overview of models for single, group objects and their parameters is given. The criterion for the existence of the group object based on two single objects is formulated. The method for group objects formation while current survey planning has been developed and its description is presented. The method comprises several processing stages for data about objects with the calculation of new parameters, the stochastic characteristics of space means and validates the spatial size of the object value of the stochastic swath and stochastic length of the route. The strict mathematical description of techniques for model creation of a group object based on data about a single object and onboard special complex facilities in difficult conditions of registration of spatial data is given. Main Results. The developed method is implemented on the basis of modern geographic information system {{in the form of a}} software <b>tool</b> <b>layout</b> with advanced tools of processing and analysis of spatial data in vector format. Experimental studies of the forming method for the group of objects were carried out on a different real object environment using the parameters of modern national systems of the Earth remote sensing detailed observation Canopus-B and Resurs-P. Practical Relevance. The proposed models and method are focused on practical implementation using vector spatial data models and modern geoinformation technologies. Practical value lies in the reduction in the amount of consumable resources by means of space and ground-based systems in the monitoring of small and point-like objects. ...|$|E

The tools are the: Signature Tool, Reach/Coreach Tool, Data Store Push-Down <b>Tool,</b> and Auto <b>Layout</b> <b>Tool.</b> The Signature Tool extracts the interface of a Simulink subsystem, identifying the subsystem’s explicit, and implicit data flow mechanisms, empowering developers to use the implicit mechanisms more effectively. The Reach/Coreach Tool identifies data and control flow dependencies in a Simulink model and uses the information for model slicing. The view of de-pendencies offered by the tool significantly eases the comprehension of large models. The dependencies can also serve as indicators of alternative designs, and facilitate more effective testing and verification. The Data Store Push-Down Tool restricts the scope of Simulink’s data stores thereby providing improved encapsulation, and increasing modularity.
