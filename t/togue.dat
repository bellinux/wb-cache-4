60|$|Before we {{had found}} this out I {{stumbled}} upon the big bull one afternoon, and came near paying the penalty of my ignorance. I had been still-fishing for <b>togue</b> (lake trout), and {{was on my way}} back to camp when, doubling a point, I ran plump upon a bull moose feeding among the lily pads. My approach had been perfectly silent,--that {{is the only way to}} see things in the woods,--and he was quite unconscious that anybody but himself was near.|$|E
50|$|Summer water {{temperatures}} range from 64° {{near the surface}} to 52° in the deepest pools. Cold water with high dissolved oxygen concentrations provides good habitat for <b>togue</b> if water levels are stable after autumn spawning occurs in the rocky shallows. Lake whitefish and round whitefish are the main food source for Chamberlain Lake <b>togue.</b> The lake also supports brook trout.|$|E

50|$|Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) is a {{freshwater}} char living {{mainly in}} lakes in northern North America. Other names for it include mackinaw, lake char (or charr), touladi, <b>togue,</b> and grey trout. In Lake Superior, {{it can also}} be variously known as siscowet, paperbelly and lean. The lake trout is prized both as a game fish and as a food fish.|$|E
50|$|Swan Lake State Park is {{a public}} {{recreation}} area {{at the north end}} of 3 mi Swan Lake in the town of Swanville, Waldo County, Maine. The state park's 67 acre offer opportunities for swimming, picnicking, canoeing, and fishing. The 1370 acre lake supports populations of smallmouth bass, landlocked salmon, white perch, brook trout, and wild <b>togue.</b> The park is managed by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.|$|E
50|$|Schoodic Lake {{is a deep}} Maine {{lake with}} a small {{drainage}} basin. The lake covers much of the western half of Lake View Plantation. Tributaries drain Orson Bog, Norton Pond, and Jaquith Pond in eastern Brownville. The {{south end of the}} lake overflows through Schoodic Stream 5 mi to the Piscataquis River 13 mi upstream of the Piscataquis confluence with the Penobscot River at Howland. The lake provides good habitat for <b>togue,</b> squaretail, and land-locked Atlantic salmon. Fishermen also find smallmouth bass, white sucker and round whitefish.|$|E
50|$|Chemquasabamticook Lake (or Ross Lake) is {{the source}} of Chemquasabamticook Stream in the North Maine Woods. The lake is in Maine {{township}}s 9 and 10 of range 15, and township 9 of range 14. Tributaries include Sweeney Brook, Boucher Brook, Gannet Brook, Fool Brook, and Ross Inlet. Chemquasabamticook Stream flows 22 mi from a disused dam {{at the north end of}} the lake to reach Long Lake on the Allagash River. Chemquasabamticook Lake has a self-sustaining native squaretail population, and rainbow smelt have been introduced to encourage more rapid growth of the native <b>togue.</b>|$|E
50|$|Allagash Lake {{is in the}} North Maine Woods on the {{boundary}} of Maine range 14 townships 7 and 8. Allagash Stream flows into {{the northwest corner of}} the lake from Allagash Pond, Crescent Pond, and Mud Pond in township 9 range 15. Allagash Stream overflows the northeast corner of the lake and flows 5 mi through Little Round Pond into Chamberlain Lake. Chamberlain Lake originally overflowed through Eagle Lake and Churchill Lake to the Allagash River; but was diverted through Telos Cut to the Penobscot River in the 1850s. Allagash Lake provides good habitat for <b>togue</b> and squaretail.|$|E
50|$|There are {{official}} hunting {{seasons for}} the grouse, deer and bears, with a state-run lottery system for awarding moose-hunting licences. Char including squaretail, <b>togue,</b> and isolated populations of blueback trout {{are the best}} known fish of the rivers and lakes. Black fly, mosquito, deer fly, and midge populations can be significant from late spring through early autumn. The Maine North Woods are also home to the endangered Canada lynx, bald eagle and the Furbish lousewort, a rare plant that is found only in the Saint John River Valley. Animals which have disappeared from the woods during European settlement include caribou and gray wolf.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to hiking and camping, approximately 25% {{of the park}} is open to hunting and trapping (with the exception of moose hunting). Park ponds and streams are open to either fly fishing or general law fishing {{as determined by the}} Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and the Baxter State Park Authority. Snowmobiling is permitted on the Tote Road, the 46 mi dirt road connecting the park's south gate at <b>Togue</b> Pond and the north gate at Matagamon. The park also includes a Scientific Forest Management Area of 29587 acre located in its northwest corner. Park donor Percival Baxter directed that this area be managed for exemplary forest management. The area has been under active management for over 20 years and conducts sustainable, Forest Stewardship Council-certified management.|$|E
5000|$|Ruhlen {{writes that}} at present {{there is only}} sparse {{evidence}} connecting Indo-Pacific to the world's other language families, but believes that further research will provide better evidence. He sees the current lack of evidence as the result partly of the general {{lack of knowledge of}} these languages and the scarcity of meaningful historical studies of them, and partly of the great linguistic diversity of New Guinea. Ruhlen gives the Southern Tasmanian mo-took (forefinger), the Southeastern Tasmanian <b>togue</b> (hand), the Proto-Karonan *dik (one), the Boven Mbian tek (fingernail), and the Digul tuk (fingernail) as examples of forms that may be related to tik, a widespread root [...] "whose original meaning was probably 'finger'." [...] According to him, the root can also be found in Nilo-Saharan, Niger-Kordofanian, Afroasiatic, Eurasiatic, Dené-Caucasian, Austric, and Amerind.|$|E
50|$|Mung {{bean sprouts}} are stir-fried as a Chinese {{vegetable}} accompaniment to a meal, usually with garlic, ginger, spring onions, or pieces of salted dried fish to add flavour. Uncooked bean sprouts {{are used in}} filling for Vietnamese spring rolls, {{as well as a}} garnish for phở. They are a major ingredient in a variety of Malaysian and Peranakan cuisine, including char kway teow, hokkien mee, mee rebus, and pasembor. In Korea, slightly cooked mung bean sprouts, called sukjunamul (hangul: 숙주나물), are often served as a side dish. They are blanched (placed into boiling water for less than a minute), immediately cooled in cold water, and mixed with sesame oil, garlic, salt, and often other ingredients. In the Philippines, mung bean sprouts are made into lumpia rolls called lumpiang <b>togue.</b> In Indonesia the food are often used as fillings like Tahu Isi (stuffed tofu) and complimentary ingredient in many dishes such as rawon and soto.|$|E

40|$|<b>Togue</b> mucosa {{surface of}} 3 -day {{postnatal}} rats was examined under {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM). For HRSEM analysis, the specimens were fixed in the same solution for 24 h, postfixed in 2 % osmiun tetroxide, critical-point dried and coated with platinum-palladium. For TEM analysis, the specimens were fixed using modified Karnovsky solution and embedded in Spurr resin. The results revealed the presence of numerous microplicae in the membrane surface of keratinized epithelial cells to which groups of bacteria were attached. These bacteria were staphylococcus and coccus organized either in rows or at random, which were visualized in three-dimensional HRSEM images. At high magnification, the TEM images revealed the adhesion of bacteria to the cell membrane through numerous filamentous structures comprising the glycocalyx. The fine fibrillar structures rising from each bacterium and from cell membrane were clearly seen. These characteristics on bacteria structure {{may be used for}} future control or prevention of bacterial diseases and for installation of the oral native flora...|$|E
40|$|The author {{investigated}} {{the development of}} the tongue of Hynobius retardatus Dunn, and obtained the following results : 1) As observed by KALLIUS in Salamanra maculosa, the main part of Hynobius' tongue first appeared as a so-called "glandular area" {{in the bottom of the}} oral cavity. Rather than being the thickening of the epithelium itself, it is the differentiation of mesoderm under the epithelium which is closely related to the Anlage of M. genioglossus. 2) From the tissue of mesoderm, vertical ledges invaded into the epithelium and devided it into many vertical parallel laminae. Each lamina is a group of cells, which did not show any differentiation at first, but later grew to tubular glands. 3) Each narrow vertical ledge contained longish nuclei which were identified as fibres of M. genioglossus. Therefore, it is evident that the muscularisation of the tongue occurred very early, or even prior to {{the development of the}} glands. 4) A little after the development of glandular area, a lymphatic space appeared in the dorsal side of M. geniohyoideus. This space lasts for a long period of time and exists even in adults. And invariably has the same width as that of the glandular area. 5) The caudal end of the glandular area was joined to the primary tongue firstly with a weak bridge which I call "Pars conjunctionis". As this bridge became stronger, it reached the top of the primary tongue, so the glandular area and the primary <b>togue</b> were on the same level. 6) Simultaneously, the hyoid arch extended forward. From another point of view, it may be said that the hyoid arch invaded from caudal into the lymphatic space and pushed the glandular area up with its cartilage and surrounding tissue...|$|E
