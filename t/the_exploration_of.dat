5|$|LGBT {{themes were}} found first in {{underground}} or alternative comics, often published by small independent presses or self-published.

5|$|Although {{the main}} {{objective}} is to navigate through seven worlds to {{reach the end of}} the game, the player can beat the game much faster by using secret Star Road routes. To access hidden worlds, the player will need to locate portals which are scattered throughout the game's levels. Portals are usually locked and require keys to open. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> these secret stages can lead to other stages, such as Special World. Completion of Special World permanently alters some sprites and the overworld map's colour scheme.|$|E

5|$|His {{final report}} for the {{government}} drew attention also to the near extinction of the sea otter and whale populations.

5|$|In 1494, the {{principal}} maritime powers, Portugal and Spain, signed a treaty which drew a line {{down the middle}} of the Atlantic Ocean and allocated all trade routes to the east of the line to Portugal. That gave Portugal dominance of the only known route to the east—via the Cape of Good Hope and Indian Ocean, which left Spain, and later other countries, to seek a western route to the Pacific. <b>The</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> the south began as part of the search for such a route.|$|E

5|$|Later Spanish Renaissance tended towards {{religious}} {{themes and}} mysticism, with poets such as fray Luis de León, Teresa of Ávila and John of the Cross, and treated {{issues related to}} <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> the New World, with chroniclers and writers such as Inca Garcilaso de la Vega and Bartolomé de las Casas, giving rise to a body of work, now known as Spanish Renaissance literature. The late Renaissance in Spain produced artists such as El Greco and composers such as Tomás Luis de Victoria and Antonio de Cabezón.|$|E

5|$|The Historic period {{begins in}} the late 18th century with <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> {{southern}} Utah by Padres Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and Francisco Atanasio Domínguez.

5|$|Although {{not without}} conflict, European Canadians' early {{interactions}} with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. First Nations and Métis peoples {{played a critical}} part {{in the development of}} European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> the continent during the North American fur trade. The Crown and indigenous peoples began interactions during the European colonization period, though the Inuit, in general, had more limited interaction with European settlers. However, from the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture. These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations. A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{archaeologist}} John Coles {{from the}} University of Cambridge began {{a research project}} {{that resulted in the}} publication of an important series of papers on many aspects of the Levels. A range of archaeological projects, such as <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> various trackways from the 3rd and 1st millennia BC and the establishment of their economic and geographic significance, was funded by various donors including English Heritage. Possibly the project's most significant excavation was of the Sweet Track in 1970, during which a Jadeite axe was discovered. Eight radiocarbon determinations of the date of the axe place it at around 3200 BC.|$|E

5|$|In January 1999, President Bill Clinton eased travel {{restrictions}} and increased cultural exchange between the United States and Cuba, leading Angelos to again seek permission {{to play an}} exhibition game in Cuba. Angelos met with Sandy Berger, Clinton's National Security Advisor, to discuss a potential exhibition. Bud Selig, the MLB Commissioner, allowed for <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> the series, though it still required the approval of MLB owners and the MLBPA.

5|$|In the arts, Romanticism {{manifested}} itself in literature and drama in {{the adoption of the}} mythical bard Ossian, <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> national poetry in the work of Robert Burns and in the historical novels of Walter Scott. Scott also had a major impact on the development of a national Scottish drama. Art was heavily influenced by Ossian and a new view of the Highlands as the location of a wild and dramatic landscape. Scott profoundly affected architecture through his re-building of Abbotsford House in the early nineteenth century, which set off the boom in the Scots Baronial revival. In music, Burns was part of an attempt to produce a canon of Scottish song, which resulted in a cross fertilisation of Scottish and continental classical music, with romantic music becoming dominant in Scotland into the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{remained}} at Cornell until 1964, {{when he went}} to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He remained there for the remainder of his career, becoming Institute Professor in 1976, and Institute Professor Emeritus in 1986. In 1963, working in collaboration with a student of his, James Felten, Morrison had investigated the effect of inverse Compton scattering, an important source of cosmic x-rays and gamma rays. At MIT, Morrison teamed up with Bruno Rossi's x-ray group there, and also with Riccardo Giacconi's group at nearby American Science and Engineering. Morrison became deeply involved in <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> the cosmos through its x-ray and gamma ray emissions. In a 1960 paper, he noted the similarities between pulsars and quasars. He returned to this in 1976, applying his model to the radio galaxy Cygnus A.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} black dogfish under Least Concern worldwide; it is {{minimally}} affected by fishing activity across {{many parts of}} its range, while its population in the northwestern Atlantic presently seems to be stable and may have increased from 1978 to 1995. By contrast, the intensity of deepwater fisheries in the northeastern Atlantic has led the IUCN to give this species a regional assessment of Near Threatened. The reproductive characteristics of the black dogfish, such as a large female maturation size, may render it susceptible to overfishing, though it is more fecund than other deep-sea dogfish sharks. In the northeastern Atlantic, catches of this species are managed {{as part of the}} total allowable catch for deep-sea sharks set by the International Council for <b>the</b> <b>Exploration</b> <b>of</b> the Sea (ICES).|$|E
5|$|The Shapes in Space segment {{focuses on}} visual and spatial awareness, with the {{presenter}} exploring shapes, colour and everyday {{materials such as}} boxes and playdough.

The presenter of Body Move encourages children to participate in movement and dance, developing physical coordination and motor development. Linguistics and aural skills are at the centre of the Word Play segment, featuring a puppet named Chatterbox who assists in <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> language through stories and rhymes.
