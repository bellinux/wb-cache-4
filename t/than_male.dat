5|$|According to the 2000 census by INEGI, Nahuatl {{is spoken}} by an {{estimated}} 1.45million people, some 198,000 (14.9%) {{of whom are}} monolingual. There are many more female <b>than</b> <b>male</b> monolinguals, and females represent nearly {{two thirds of the}} total number. The states of Guerrero and Hidalgo have the highest rates of monolingual Nahuatl speakers relative to the total Nahuatl speaking population, at 24.2% and 22.6%, respectively. For most other states the percentage of monolinguals among the speakers is less than 5%. This means that in most states more than 95% of the Nahuatl speaking population are bilingual in Spanish.|$|E

5|$|Female {{individuals}} of Laevistrombus canarium are generally larger (both shell and soft parts) <b>than</b> <b>male</b> individuals, {{which is also}} the case in other strombid gastropods such as the spider conch (Harpago chiragra) and queen conch (Lobatus gigas). The external anatomy of the soft parts of this species {{is similar to that of}} the other members of the family: the animal has a long extensible snout and thin eyestalks (also known as ommatophores), with well-developed lens eyes at the tips. Each eyestalk has a small sensory tentacle branching off near the end. The large foot of the animal is narrow and strong, able to perform the leaping form of locomotion that is also found in other species of Strombidae (such as the queen conch).|$|E
5|$|Flowers {{are usually}} borne {{in groups of}} three—one female flower {{together}} with two male flowers. In some species groups of four flowers (two male and two female) have been reported. At {{the far end of}} the inflorescence, away from the axis of the tree, pairs of male flowers replace the triads of male and female flowers. Flower colour is poorly known. It must be recorded from live plants, since preserved flowers lose their colour over time, and records of these species in the wild are incomplete. Male flowers tend to fall into two groups—those with cream or yellow flowers and those with some amount of purple in the flowers. Female flowers are even less well known <b>than</b> <b>male</b> flowers.|$|E
5|$|In Polistes exclamans, equal {{sex ratio}} is {{obtained}} when only 46.3% of investment {{is devoted to}} females as female wasps are 1.16 times larger <b>than</b> <b>male</b> wasps. In a study done by Strassmann, {{it was found that}} sexual investment is female biased, especially during years of high predation and when nests are generally less successful. It has been seen that in Polistes exclamans, females are produced before males. This female investment bias may result from the ability of females to become either a worker or a reproductive (this is more adaptive for the nest as it gives the nest increased flexibility compared to that of males and may be important for overall nest success) or because females provide the colony with greater nest defense. Furthermore, even when the original queen is no longer present, the sexual investment is still biased towards females, which is not expected given the genetic implications of a new queen.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, Feynman began {{thinking}} of writing an autobiography, {{and he began}} granting interviews to historians. In the 1980s, working with Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), he recorded chapters on audio tape that Robert transcribed. The book was published in 1985 as Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and became a best-seller. The publication of the book brought {{a new wave of}} protest about Feynman's attitude toward women. There had been protests over his alleged sexism in 1968, and again in 1972. It did not help that Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired as Caltech's first female professor in 1969, was refused tenure in 1974. She filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that she had been paid less <b>than</b> <b>male</b> colleagues. La Belle finally received tenure in 1979. Many of Feynman's colleagues were surprised that he took her side. He had gotten to know her, and both liked and admired her.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{the school}} {{drop-out}} rate among girls was very high (almost 50 percent), even though the educational achievements of female students were higher <b>than</b> <b>male</b> students at different levels of education. Since then, education for women has improved rapidly. In Lahore there are 46 public colleges out of which 26 are female colleges and some of the others are co-educational.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have demonstrated}} that functional outcome following traumatic brain injury differs between males and females. Some studies report that females have a better outcome <b>than</b> <b>males</b> following trauma while others report the opposite. In experimental studies, some of the contradictory results {{may be due to the}} different experimental conditions, including type of anesthesia and the outcome measures employed. In the present study we have used three different anesthetic protocols and four different outcome measures to determine how these parameters interact and affect functional outcome following traumatic brain injury in male and female rats. Diffuse traumatic brain injury was induced in adult male and female animals using the impact-acceleration brain injury model. Mortality in female animals was no different <b>than</b> <b>males</b> when using halothane anesthesia, slightly better <b>than</b> <b>males</b> when using isoflurane anesthesia, but significantly worse <b>than</b> <b>males</b> under pentobarbital anesthesia. Female animals always performed better <b>than</b> <b>males</b> on rotarod tests of motor outcome, with this effect being unrelated to anesthetic effects. Conversely, in cognitive tests using the Barnes Maze, only isoflurane-anesthetized females performed better <b>than</b> their <b>male</b> counterparts. Similarly, in an open field activity task, females always performed better <b>than</b> <b>males</b> after trauma, with isoflurane-anesthetized females also performing significantly better than the halothane-anesthetized female group after injury. Our results suggest that female animals do better <b>than</b> <b>males</b> after diffuse traumatic brain injury, although this observation is dependent upon the type of anesthesia and the functional task employed. Isoflurane is particularly protective in females, pentobarbital is deleterious to female outcome, while halothane anesthesia has the least influence on gender-related outcome. Christine A.

50|$|Genetic {{variation}} is minimal within Heterohyrax brucei.

25|$|Another {{limitation}} of the social research is that nearly all of it has concerned girls, partly because female puberty requires greater physiologic resources and partly because it involves a unique event (menarche) that makes survey research into female puberty much simpler <b>than</b> <b>male.</b> More detail is provided in the menarche article.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that gender does impact a programmer’s perceived merit in the community. A 2016 study identified the gender of over one million programmers on GitHub, by linking the programmer’s GitHub account to their other social media accounts. Between male and female programmers, {{the researchers found that}} female programmers were actually more likely to have their pull requests accepted into the project <b>than</b> <b>male</b> programmers, however only when the female had a gender-neutral profile. When females had profiles with a name or image that identified them as female, they were less likely <b>than</b> <b>male</b> programmers to have their pull requests accepted. Another study in 2015 found that of open source projects on GitHub, gender diversity was a significant positive predictor of a team's productivity, meaning that open source teams with a more even mix of different genders tended to be more highly productive.|$|E
