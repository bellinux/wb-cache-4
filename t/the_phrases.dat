In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, {{and they do not}} agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in <b>the</b> <b>phrases</b> the slender boy, and many slender girls, the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.|$|E

Daniel said he had won the money in his possession playing cards, while Wilson claimed to have brought his {{with him when he}} came to Rhodesia. Witnesses confirmed that there had been heavy gambling at Inyati camp, in which Daniel and Wilson had actively taken part, both possessing noticeable reserves in gold sovereigns. Sehuloholu claimed in his statement that both of the men he had met in the rear guard had fluently and perfectly spoken to him in Sindebele, but neither of the accused men knew the language, and {{the only member of the}} column who did at a fluent level was a medical orderly who had never been near the rear guard. The prosecutor proposed that Sehuloholu could be exaggerating the standard of Sindebele spoken by the men he had met, pointing out that most of <b>the</b> <b>phrases</b> quoted were actually relatively basic, and did not imply a profound understanding of the language.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{constraint}} in Tagalog on {{the position}} {{from which a}} noun can be relativised and in which a gap can appear: A noun {{has to be the}} subject within the relative clause in order for it to be relativised. <b>The</b> <b>phrases</b> in (2) are ungrammatical because the nouns that have been relativised are not the subjects of their respective relative clauses.

It has been therefore suggested that he might have coined <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> himself.|$|R
