40|$|AbstractThe {{information}} and technology era {{we live in}} has brought along an ever-increasing need for translation. In parallel with growing international co-operations of both political and commercial nature, the need for translation increased as well, therefore quality expectations are raised.

There are various languages offered in translator training in Turkey. German, English and French are prominent languages in that regard. Growing number of translator <b>training</b> <b>departments</b> has also accelerated the scientific research in Turkey. The content and aspects of scientific research in translation studies is determined by the scientific language of scholar along with other factors. In that context, translator <b>training</b> <b>departments</b> take certain language pairs into consideration for theory and application. This study aims to find out the role of scientific language on courses and their content, and whether there is a difference in curricula and courses in that regard and the reasons of possible differences and what their effects might be. For that purpose, curricula and course content of translator <b>training</b> <b>departments</b> will be compared according to certain criteria...|$|R

25|$|This was {{the first}} Doctor Who serial to have its {{location}} material shot entirely on OB videotape, {{as opposed to the}} more usual BBC television drama practice of the time of shooting studio interiors on videotape and location exteriors on film. This was due to the large number of video effects involving the eponymous robot required in exterior scenes (shot at the then BBC Engineering <b>Training</b> <b>Department</b> at Wood Norton, Worcestershire), which were easier and more convincing to marry to videotape than to film. The team had learned that lesson during the previous season's Invasion of the Dinosaurs. The Wood Norton facility was chosen for location shooting because it had an underground bunker, which director Christopher Barry felt would be suitable for the entrance to the underground complex in the story; however, they were refused permission to shoot in that area.|$|E
