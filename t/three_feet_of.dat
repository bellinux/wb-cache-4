5|$|Dave Lister, {{played by}} Craig Charles, is a genial Liverpudlian and {{self-described}} bum. He was the lowest-ranking of the 169 crew {{members on the}} ship before the accident. He has a long-standing desire to return to Earth and start a farm and/or diner on Fiji (which is under <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> water following a volcanic eruption), but is left impossibly far away by the accident, which renders him the last (known) surviving member of the human race. He likes Indian food, especially chicken vindaloo, which is a recurring theme in the series.|$|E
5|$|Two or <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> snow {{may turn}} into {{less than a}} foot of ice. The weight above makes deeper layers of ice thin and flow outwards. Ice is lost {{at the edges of}} the glacier to icebergs, or to summer melting, and the overall shape of the glacier does not change much with time. The outward flow can distort the layers, so it is {{desirable}} to drill deep ice cores at places where there is very little flow. These can be located using maps of the flow lines.|$|E

The said hanap and cover were given to the king by monseigneur the duc de Berry on his journey into Touraine in the year 91.|$|E
5|$|Monti {{made three}} {{attempts}} to reach Bradbury. On his first, he advanced to within <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> Bradbury before being forced back by intense machine-gun and rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) fire. His second try was similarly {{turned back and}} {{as the rest of}} his patrol provided covering fire, Monti advanced a third time but was struck by an RPG. Some news reports indicated that the explosion blew off both of his legs, but this is not supported by family accounts or military records. Monti attempted to crawl back towards cover. He is reported by comrades to have made his peace with God and asked Sgt. Cunningham to tell his parents he loved them. Monti died moments later. At about the same time, the artillery and air support for which he had called began hitting the enemy position, killing 22 of the attackers and dispersing the rest.|$|E
5|$|After moving ashore, Sandy {{continued}} {{moving to}} the west, weakening below hurricane force {{by the time it}} reached Pennsylvania. Because the system was non-tropical, the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) – known at the time as the Hydrometeorogical Prediction Center (HPC) – took over the responsibility of issuing advisories on the low. The remnants of Sandy brought heavy snow and high winds to the central Appalachian Mountains, resulting in blizzard warnings being issued. The system continued to weaken as it moved across western Pennsylvania, and by 0300UTC on October31, the storm's movement had shifted to the northwest. Blizzard conditions continued in the Appalachians, bringing more snow to the region that had already seen high amounts the day before. By 0900UTC on October31, the circulation degenerated into a trough of low pressure, with no discernible center of low pressure. Later that day, the remnants of Sandy spread into the Great Lakes, and the WPC issued its last advisory. By the time the system had moved out of the region, nearly <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> snow had fallen in some areas of West Virginia, Tennessee, and Maryland, with lesser amounts elsewhere in the region. During the next two days, Sandy's remnants drifted northward and then northeastward over Ontario, before merging with another low pressure area over Eastern Canada, on November 2.|$|E

25|$|The {{total cost}} of {{construction}} was approximately $108million. According to the US Army Corps of Engineers, Kinzua more than paid for itself in 1972 when tropical storm Agnes dumped continual heavy rains on the watershed, bringing the reservoir to within <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> its maximum storage capacity. Downstream flood damages were avoided of an estimated $247million. The dam at Kinzua has prevented an estimated $1 billion in flood damages since becoming operational.|$|E

25|$|The {{blizzard}} {{was part}} of a winter remarkable for its snowstorms in the affected states, where total snowfall for the season ranked in the topten and even higher in some areas. In sections of the coastal northeast, 75inches of total snowfall occurred that year. Some Maryland communities getting more than <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> snow in the President's Day blizzard, such as Kingsville and Perry Hall, experienced more than 80inches of snow for the entire winter season.|$|E
25|$|Early on July 31, 1977, Stacy Moskowitz and Robert Violante, both 20, were in Violante's car, {{which was}} parked under a streetlight near a city {{park in the}} {{neighborhood}} of Bath Beach. They were kissing when a man approached within <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> the passenger side of Violante's car and fired four rounds into the car, striking both victims in the head before he escaped into the park. Moskowitz died several hours later in the hospital. Violante survived, although he lost vision in one eye and retained very limited vision in the other eye.|$|E
25|$|During April 1881, {{under the}} command of John William Nicholson, the Advance got away from a near miss when leaving the Grey River at Greymouth under tow of the steam tug Dispatch. The tow ropes were lost and the vessel drifted into the breakwater, moving too fast for the anchor to have held her. The sails were raised, but the wind had died away, and the crew lost control of the vessel. The Dispatch, however, managed to take the Advance in tow once again and left her on the flat {{opposite}} the town. <b>Three</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> water had washed aboard, but no major damage was sustained.|$|E

500|$|The first U.S. {{citizens}} {{to take up}} permanent residence on Key Biscayne were Captain John Dubose, his wife Margaret and their five children in 1825, when Dubose became the first keeper for the new Cape Florida Light, a post he held until the lighthouse was burned in 1836. The family was also accompanied by two former slaves of Margaret's brother. The Dubose household grew during that time and was reported in 1833 to consist of [...] "eleven whites and several negroes". During his tenure as lighthouse keeper, Dubose received hundreds of plants and seeds from Dr. Henry Perrine, United States Consul in Campeche, Mexico, which he planted on the island. In 1835 a major hurricane struck the island, damaging the lighthouse and the keeper's house, and putting the island under <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> water, which killed almost all the plants that Dr. Perrine had sent from Mexico.|$|E
500|$|On August 2, the Tanana River at Nenana crested at 14.64feet. This total {{was more}} than four feet above flood stage and was the third-highest water level ever {{recorded}}, falling short of a 15.9-foot mark in 1948 and the record 18.9-foot mark recorded during the flood of 1967. The town shipyard was submerged under <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> water, and the town's clinic was moved from its interim location in the fire station to the town airport after floodwater threatened the station. Town leaders encouraged residents to evacuate to higher ground until the flood receded. Nenana High School was saved from flooding by just eight inches of elevation. Water lapped around the school's base, but did not enter the school itself due to that small margin. High water lingered in the town until August 3, when a National Weather Service forecaster felt confident enough to say, [...] "The worst is over." ...|$|E

500|$|The Tangascootack Creek {{valley is}} {{the only part of}} Bald Eagle Township that has {{significant}} amounts of minerals. Sandstones and conglomerates are visible on escarpments {{on the sides of the}} creek. Pocono sandstone is found on both the main stem and North Fork Tangascootack Creek, but no Mauch Chunk red shale is found near either branch. Coal formations in the creek's watershed include the Clarion formation, the Lower Kittaning formation, and the Eagleton coal field. Brown sandstone from the surface to [...] down, blue slate from about [...] to [...] down, and fireclay from [...] to [...] down are also found in the rocks on the creek. Two to <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> coal are below the fireclay and 4 to 5.5 feet are below the brown sandstone. Additionally, a graphite deposit was discovered on the creek by James David. The coal in the creek's watershed is bituminous coal.|$|E
500|$|In central Greenland {{a typical}} year might produce two or <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> winter snow, {{plus a few}} inches of summer snow. [...] When this turns to ice, the two layers will make up no more than a foot of ice. [...] The layers {{corresponding}} to the summer snow will contain bigger bubbles than the winter layers, so the alternating layers remain visible, which makes it possible to count down a core and determine the age of each layer. [...] As the depth increases {{to the point where the}} ice structure changes to a clathrate, the bubbles are no longer visible, and the layers can no longer be seen. [...] Dust layers may now become visible. [...] Ice from Greenland cores contains dust carried by wind; the dust appears most strongly in late winter, and appears as cloudy grey layers. [...] These layers are stronger and easier to see at times in the past when the earth's climate was cold, dry, and windy.|$|E
500|$|The 1997 Red River flood caused over $815 036 000 in damages.The first flood outlook {{was issued}} on February 13, 1997, by the National Weather Service, declaring {{that there was}} [...] "...a high spring {{snowmelt}} flood potential for the tributaries to the Red River, and a severe spring snowmelt potential for the Red River from Wahpeton, North Dakota, to the Canadian border." [...] On February 27, a flood planning meeting in Fargo revealed that Fargo, Wahpeton, and Grand Forks would see the Red River rise to 38, 17.9, and , respectively. The Corps of Engineers recommended on March 24 that Grand Forks' engineers build dikes to a height of , which would provide <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> leeway for the [...] estimate. Additionally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) publicly encouraged Grand Forks residents to purchase flood insurance, but only a thousand of the 52,000 residents did so. Later, researchers at the University of North Dakota determined that although more than 90% of residents knew about the option of purchasing flood insurance, {{only a small percentage}} purchased it since they believed the National Weather Service had projected that the river would not crest high enough to warrant a flood.|$|E
