5|$|Physicians who specialise in the {{treatment}} of thyroid disorders are known generally as endocrinologists, thyroid specialists or thyroidologists. Thyroid surgeon or otolaryngologistss {{may play a role in}} the surgical management of <b>thyroid</b> <b>disease</b> and general practitioners and family physicians may play a role in monitoring for and identifying symptoms related to <b>thyroid</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
5|$|Treatment of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>disease</b> usually {{leads to}} {{resolution}} of the paralytic attacks. Depending {{on the nature of}} the disease, the treatment may consist of thyrostatics (drugs that reduce production of thyroid hormone), radioiodine, or occasionally thyroid surgery.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{widespread}} {{screening of}} the general population is a matter of debate. Some organizations (such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force) state that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening, while others (such as the American Thyroid Association) recommend either intermittent testing above a certain age in both sexes or only in women. Targeted screening may be appropriate in a number of situations where hypothyroidism is common: other autoimmune diseases, a strong family history of <b>thyroid</b> <b>disease,</b> those who have received radioiodine or other radiation therapy to the neck, those who have previously undergone thyroid surgery, those with an abnormal thyroid examination, those with psychiatric disorders, people taking amiodarone or lithium, and those with a number of health conditions (such as certain heart and skin conditions). Yearly thyroid function tests are recommended in people with Down syndrome, as they are at higher risk of <b>thyroid</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} excess thyroid hormone {{typically}} {{respond to the}} administration of a non-selective beta blocker, such as propranolol (as most of the symptoms are driven by increased levels of adrenaline {{and its effect on}} the β-adrenergic receptors). Subsequent attacks may be prevented by avoiding known precipitants, such as high salt or carbohydrate intake, until the <b>thyroid</b> <b>disease</b> has been adequately treated.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{underlying}} form of <b>thyroid</b> <b>disease</b> associated with TPP is Graves' disease, a syndrome {{due to an}} autoimmune reaction that leads to overproduction of thyroid hormone. TPP has also been described in people with other thyroid problems such as thyroiditis, toxic nodular goiter, toxic adenoma, TSH-producing pituitary adenoma, excessive ingestion of thyroxine or iodine, and amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism.|$|E
5|$|There may be {{symptoms}} of thyroid overactivity, such as weight loss, a fast heart rate, tremor, and perspiration; but such symptoms occur in {{only half of}} all cases. The {{most common type of}} hyperthyroidism, Graves' disease, may additionally cause eye problems (Graves' ophthalmopathy) and skin changes of the legs (pretibial myxedema). <b>Thyroid</b> <b>disease</b> may also cause muscle weakness in the form of thyrotoxic myopathy, but this is constant rather than episodic.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{number of}} reports have {{indicated}} {{an association between}} <b>thyroid</b> <b>diseases</b> and primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). However, fewer studies have investigated whether the presence of <b>thyroid</b> <b>diseases</b> is associated with increased risk of developing pSS. Thus, the aim of our study was to use a nationwide health claims database to explore the prevalence and risk of pSS in female patients with <b>thyroid</b> <b>diseases.</b> METHODS: From the Registry of Catastrophic Illness database in the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan, we identified 389 female patients with a diagnosis of pSS from 2005 to 2010. We also obtained 1945 control subjects frequency-matched on sex, 10 -year age interval, and year of index date from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID 2000). Both groups were retrospectively traced back to a period of eight years to obtain diagnosis of <b>thyroid</b> <b>diseases</b> prior to index date. RESULTS: A significantly higher risk of pSS {{was associated with the}} presence of <b>thyroid</b> <b>diseases</b> (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2. 1, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 6 - 2. 9). Among the sub-categories of <b>thyroid</b> <b>diseases,</b> patients with thyroiditis (AOR = 3. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 7 - 7. 5), thyrotoxicosis (AOR = 2. 5, 95 % CI = 1. 6 - 3. 8), and unspecified hypothyroidism (AOR = 2. 4, 95 % CI = 1. 2 - 4. 6), and simple and unspecified goiter (AOR = 2. 0, 95 % CI = 1. 3 - 3. 3) were significantly associated with increased risk of pSS. The associations were generally stronger in the mid-forties to mid-sixties age group, except in patients with unspecified hypothyroidism. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of pSS was significantly increased in female patients with <b>thyroid</b> <b>diseases,</b> particularly those in their mid-forties to mid-sixties. An increased awareness of the possibility of pSS in perimenopausal females with <b>thyroid</b> <b>diseases</b> is important to preserve their quality of life and to avoid comorbidity...|$|R

5|$|After several {{case reports}} in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{periodic}} paralysis was first described in full by the German neurologist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890) in 1885. In 1926 the Japanese physician Tetsushiro Shinosaki, from Fukuoka, observed {{the high rate of}} <b>thyroid</b> <b>disease</b> in Japanese people with periodic paralysis. The first English-language report, in 1931, originated from Dunlap and Kepler, physicians at the Mayo Clinic; they described the condition in a patient with features of Graves' disease. In 1937 periodic paralysis was linked with hypokalemia, as well as precipitation of attacks with glucose and insulin. This phenomenon {{has been used as a}} diagnostic test.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} how the {{described}} genetic defects increase the Na+/K+-ATPase activity, but it is suspected that the enzyme becomes more active due to increased thyroid hormone levels. Hyperthyroidism increases the levels of catecholamines (such as adrenaline) in the blood, increasing Na+/K+-ATPase activity. The enzyme activity is then increased further by the precipitating causes. For instance, increased carbohydrate intake leads to increased insulin levels; this is known to activate Na+/K+-ATPase. Once the precipitant is removed, the enzyme activity returns to normal levels. It has been postulated that male hormones increase Na+/K+-ATPase activity, and that this explains why males are at a higher risk of TPP despite <b>thyroid</b> <b>disease</b> being more common in females.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound of {{the thyroid}} {{may be used}} to reveal whether {{structures}} are solid or filled with fluid, helping to differentiate between nodules and goitres and cysts. It may also help differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy may be taken concurrently of thyroid tissue to determine the nature of a lesion. These biopsies are then sent for histopathology and cytology. When further imaging is required, a radiolabelled iodine-123 or technetium-99 uptake scan may take place. This can determine {{the size and shape of}} lesions, reveal whether nodules or goitres are metabolically active, and reveal and monitor sites of <b>thyroid</b> <b>disease</b> or cancer deposits outside the thyroid.|$|E

Creatine kinase levels are elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of rhabdomyolysis (muscle tissue destruction) are rare. Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) may show tachycardia (a fast heart rate) due to the <b>thyroid</b> <b>disease,</b> abnormalities due to cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation, and T wave flattening).

5|$|Seaborg {{remained}} at the University of California, Berkeley, for post-doctoral research. He followed Frederick Soddy's work investigating isotopes {{and contributed to the}} discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence's advanced cyclotrons, John Livingood, Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, iron-59 (Fe-59) in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the hemoglobin in human blood. In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as they did for five years) to create an important isotope of iodine, iodine-131 (I-131), which is still used to treat <b>thyroid</b> <b>disease.</b> (Many years later, it was credited with prolonging the life of Seaborg's mother.) As a result of these and other contributions, Seaborg is regarded as a pioneer in nuclear medicine and is one of its most prolific discoverers of isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg was the {{principal}} or co-discoverer of ten elements: plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium and element 106, which, {{while he was still}} living, was named seaborgium in his honor. He also discovered more than 100 atomic isotopes and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the Manhattan Project where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the second atomic bomb. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, most notably iodine-131, which is used in the treatment of <b>thyroid</b> <b>disease.</b> In addition to his theoretical work {{in the development of the}} actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series.|$|E

Frozen tissue samples of 46 thyroid carcinomas and 30 benign <b>thyroid</b> <b>diseases</b> (14 multinodular goiters, 14 follicular adenomas, two Hashimoto's hyroiditis) were obtained intraoperatively. Preoperative blood samples were drawn from 31 patients with thyroid cancer, nine patients with benign thyroid disorders and 20 healthy volunteers. Nine out of nine medullary, 9 / 12 follicular, 7 / 19 papillary and 2 / 6 anaplastic carcinomas expressed CK 20 transcripts.

40|$|Background: Thyroperoxidase is {{the major}} antigen of the thyroid microsomal {{antibodies}} (TMA) detected in autoimmune <b>thyroid</b> <b>diseases.</b> Its amino acid sequence has 44 % homology with myeloperoxidase (MPO), an enzyme present in the primary granules of neutrophils {{and one of the}} major antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) antigens. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the presence of cross-reactivity to MPO of TMA. Methods: We studied sera from 51 patients with autoimmune <b>thyroid</b> <b>diseases,</b> all of them TMA-positive. The presence of ANCA was investigated by indirect immunofluorescence and by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: ANCA were positive in 3. 9 % of the TMA-positive sera and none of them reacted with MPO. In contrast, the ANCA-positive sera revealed antielastase activity. None of the ANCA-positive cases presented clinical signs of vasculitis. However, these 2 patients had been on prolonged treatment with propylthiouracil. Conclusions: We conclude that there is no cross-reactivity to MPO of TMA in patients with autoimmune <b>thyroid</b> <b>diseases,</b> possibly because of difference in the spatial configuration of the immunodominant region. The presence of ANCA in patients with autoimmune <b>thyroid</b> <b>diseases</b> without evidence of vasculitis might result from propylthiouracil-induced polyclonal activation...|$|R
