5|$|At {{the request}} of the Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons, a panel of former justices and {{selected}} MPs was tasked with sorting through the documents, and determining the need to release or withhold them. To date, only about 4,000 out of the estimated 40,000 documents have been released, A final report released in June 2012 found no wrongdoing by Canadian Forces members, but did issue recommendations related to improving military policing and MPCC access to information and witnesses. The Canadian public generally held views that there was knowledge of detainee abuse by military or government officials. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>has</b> also led to scrutiny on detainee treatment by other Canadian departments and the armed forces of other nations.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses {{have been}} {{interpreted}} as omens, or portents. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus wrote that Thales of Miletus predicted an eclipse {{that occurred during}} a battle between the Medes and the Lydians. Both sides put down their weapons and declared peace {{as a result of}} the eclipse. The exact eclipse involved remains uncertain, although <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>has</b> been studied by hundreds of ancient and modern authorities. One likely candidate took place on May 28, 585 BC, probably near the Halys river in Asia Minor. An eclipse recorded by Herodotus before Xerxes departed for his expedition against Greece, which is traditionally dated to 480 BC, was matched by John Russell Hind to an annular eclipse of the Sun at Sardis on February 17, 478 BC. Alternatively, a partial eclipse was visible from Persia on October 2, 480 BC. Herodotus also reports a solar eclipse at Sparta during the Second Persian invasion of Greece. The date of the eclipse (August 1, 477 BC) does not match exactly the conventional dates for the invasion accepted by historians.|$|E
5|$|In early 2000, Croatia and Serbia {{set up a}} {{commission}} tasked with determining the border, but in its first ten years it convened only once or twice. Since 2010, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>has</b> gained increasing prominence in the disputing countries. Plans for construction of a port in Apatin, {{on a piece of}} territory claimed by Croatia, added fuel to the dispute. After years of inactivity the inter-governmental commission established to identify and determine the border between Croatia and Serbia met in Zagreb in April 2010, only to conclude that there was a difference of opinions on the matter. Later that month, the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) proposed a National Assembly resolution which would require that Serbian officials resolve the dispute in compliance with the Serbian claim. Months later, Radoslav Stojanović, a former legal representative of Serbia and Montenegro in the Bosnian Genocide Case and former ambassador to the Netherlands, likened the dispute to the Croatia–Slovenia border dispute in the Gulf of Piran. Stojanović said that the position held by Croatia in its dispute with Slovenia was favourable for Serbia and warned that Serbia might be in a disadvantageous position if Croatia joined the European Union (EU) before Serbia—which would allow it to impose its conditions to the process of accession of Serbia to the EU.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 13 September 1810 was an {{inconclusive}} frigate engagement {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars between British Royal Navy and French Navy frigates during which a British frigate {{was defeated by}} two French vessels near Isle de France (now Mauritius), but British reinforcements were able to recapture the ship before the French could secure her. The British frigate was HMS Africaine, a new arrival to the Indian Ocean. She was {{under the command of}} Captain Robert Corbet, who had served there the previous year. Corbet was a notoriously unpopular officer and his death in the battle provoked a storm of controversy in Britain over claims that Corbet had either committed suicide at the shame of losing his ship, been murdered by his disaffected crew, or been abandoned by his men, who were said to have refused to load their guns while he remained in command. Whether any of these rumours were accurate has never been satisfactorily determined, but <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>has</b> been discussed in several prominent naval histories and was the subject of at least one lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|The new {{pieces were}} {{publicly}} announced on May 15, 1965, and coin dealers immediately offered $7.50 each for them, ensuring {{that they would}} not circulate. The public announcement prompted a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources during a severe coin shortage, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 dollars had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure {{that there would be no}} repetition, Congress inserted a provision in the Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. No 1964-D Peace dollars are known to exist in either public or private hands. Two specimens were discovered in a Treasury vault in 1970 and were destroyed, but rumors and speculation about others in illegal private possession continue to appear from time to time. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>has</b> also been privately restruck using unofficial dies and genuine, earlier-date Peace dollars resulting in an altered date.|$|E
5|$|While II Canadian Corps pushed {{south from}} Caen toward Falaise in Operation Totalize on 8 August, Bradley and Montgomery {{realised}} {{that there was}} an opportunity for the bulk of the German forces to be trapped at Falaise. The Third Army continued the encirclement from the south, reaching Alençon on 11August. Although Hitler continued to insist until 14 August that his forces should counter-attack, Kluge and his officers began planning a retreat eastward. The German forces were severely hampered by Hitler's insistence on making all major decisions himself, which left his forces without orders for periods as long as 24 hours while information was sent {{back and forth to the}} Führer's residence at Obersalzberg in Bavaria. On the evening of 12 August, Patton asked Bradley if his forces should continue northward to close the gap and encircle the German forces. Bradley refused, because Montgomery had already assigned the First Canadian Army to take the territory from the north. The Canadians met heavy resistance and captured Falaise on 16 August. The gap was closed on 21 August, trapping 50,000 German troops but more than a third of the German 7th Army and the remnants of nine of the eleven Panzer divisions had escaped to the east. Montgomery's decision-making regarding the Falaise Gap was criticised at the time by American commanders, especially Patton, although Bradley was more sympathetic and believed Patton would not have been able to close the gap. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>has</b> been the subject of much discussion among historians, criticism being levelled at American, British and Canadian forces. Hitler relieved Kluge of his command of OB West on 15 August and replaced him with Field Marshal Walter Model. Kluge committed suicide on 19 August after Hitler became aware of his involvement in the 20 July plot. An invasion in southern France (Operation Dragoon) was launched on 15 August.|$|E
