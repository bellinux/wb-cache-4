25|$|Former President Herbert Hoover was {{chairman}} of the 12-member bipartisan Congressional Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch, which was established prior to the passage of the National Security Act of 1947.

After a series of hearings, the Hoover Commission submitted a 121-page report written by Eberstadt's task force on January 13, 1949. The Eberstadt Report found that the National Security Act of 1947 soundly constructed the national security organization; however there remained organizational and qualitative inadequacies in national intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency. The report's biggest criticism concerned the lack of coordination efforts between the CIA, the military, and the State Department that resulted in duplication efforts, and subjective and biased intelligence estimates.|$|E

Mehsud denied the accusation, with al-Qaeda spokesman Mustafa Abu al-Yazid instead claiming that his organisation had carried out the killing {{on the order of}} its second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahiri. The PPP accused the government of a cover-up, with several PPP figures claiming that Bhutto had been killed by a sniper linked to <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>agencies.</b> Within Pakistan there was also public speculation that the attack might have been masterminded by India, or the United States.
