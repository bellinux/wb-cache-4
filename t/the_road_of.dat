5|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on the Universal Studios in Los Angeles, and is protagonized {{by himself and}} his son Ricardo Arjona Jr. It was {{directed}} by Robert García. The video was released on 29 April 2012. In it, Arjona is seen walking throughout a city. While he walks with a guitar on his shoulder, on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>of</b> that city, he encounters with many people, including a musician and a police man while remembering past memories of his life.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} planned {{to begin at}} 2:30 AM local time by the organizers, but due to large crowds and some {{participants}} arriving late, the race officially started at 2:43. The riders formed three groups on <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>of</b> which the first one contained twenty riders when it passed through the checkpoint in Brescia. The group further thinned to sixteen {{by the time it}} reached Verona, and to eleven when it arrived at the checkpoint in Vicenza. From the group, the sprint to the finish line was mainly contested by Giovanni Micheletto and Giuseppe Santhià, of which the former managed to win the leg. With Atala-Dunlop's Micheletto winning the stage and his teammate Carlo Galetti finishing third, Atala-Dunlop acquired seven points and the lead in the race.|$|E

5|$|With dawn nearing, Adan {{realized}} that if the pontoon bridge could not {{be brought to the}} canal during the few remaining hours of dark, an entire day would pass without a bridge being laid across the canal, and in daylight, the paratroopers would sustain more casualties. He sent a half-track company to reconnoiter Akavish at 3:00. Half an hour later, the company reported it had reached the crossing site without encountering any resistance. The Egyptian battalion fighting the paratroopers had focused all their attention on the Israelis at Tirtur, ignoring activity on Akavish. Adan took a risky decision, sending the irreplaceable pontoons down Akavish to the canal. IDF bulldozers cleared <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>of</b> wreckage and debris, and the Israelis reached Fort Lakekan before turning northwards, finally reaching the crossing site. Bridge construction was started immediately by military engineers of the 143rd Division.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, German forces besieged Leningrad {{following}} the Axis {{invasion of the}} Soviet Union in June 1941. The siege lasted 872 days, from September 1941 to January 1944. The Siege of Leningrad proved one of the longest, most destructive, and most lethal sieges of a major city in modern history. It isolated the city from most supplies except those provided through <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> <b>of</b> Life across Lake Ladoga. More than one million civilians were killed, mainly from starvation. Many others were eventually evacuated or escaped, so the city became largely depopulated.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent times}} the {{landscape}} of Lapa has been significantly amended. Where was the Square of the Brazilian armed forces (a square attached to the arches) today {{there is a huge}} Circo Voador. Arches Street, which crosses the aqueduct, was via a building occupied by trees, including the Progress Casting, which is now a venue. The neighborhood is born {{at the end of the}} south, where <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>of</b> glory becomes Rua da Lapa. Also on the border of Santa Teresa, climbing its slopes and the small neighborhood of Fátima.|$|E
25|$|Soviet forces {{tried to}} lift the siege, which was causing severe damage {{to the city and}} losses in {{civilian}} population. <b>The</b> <b>Road</b> <b>of</b> Life was frequently disabled by regular German airstrikes. Several smaller offensives were launched in 1942 in the region, but failed. The last offensive near Lyuban resulted in the encirclement and destruction of most of the Soviet 2nd Shock Army. Nevertheless, the opening of a supply route to Leningrad was so important that preparations for the new operation began almost immediately after the defeat at Lyuban.|$|E
