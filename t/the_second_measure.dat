(According to {{the promise}} He made to our ancestors), {{the last line}} of the Magnificat canticle, is written in stile antico, the old style of the musical [...] "fathers", as a strict fugue, one voice {{following}} the other as one generation follows the other. The theme has four distinctly different measures: the first repeated notes, the second flowing eighth notes, the third quarter notes in leaps, the fourth half notes leaping up a sixth. The countersubject has leaps down and up an octave in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>measure,</b> the flowing eighth notes in the third measure. When the theme is developed the first time, four voices enter from bottom to top. In the second development, soprano I begins, followed by alto, tenor and bass. The movements ends with a more homophonic section in which the bass has the theme once more, while soprano I sings long suspended notes covering almost an octave down. Hogwood sees Bach alluding to his musical [...] "forefathers": [...] "He portrays, in a very square fugue, exactly how square he thought the forefathers of German music were.

2500|$|Yambú is {{considered}} the oldest style of rumba, originating in colonial times. Hence, it is often called [...] "yambú de tiempo España" [...] (yambú of Spanish times).

Although male dancers may flirt with female dancers during the dance, they do not use the vacunao of guaguancó. In Matanzas the basic quinto part for yambú and guaguancó alternates the tone-slap melody. The following example shows the sparsest form of the basic Matanzas-style quinto for yambú and guaguancó.

2500|$|Bossa nova has at {{its core}} a rhythm based on samba. Samba {{combines}} the rhythmic patterns and feel originating in former African slave communities. Samba's emphasis on the second beat carries through to bossa nova (to the degree that it is often notated in 2/4 time). However, unlike samba, bossa nova doesn't have dance steps to accompany it. When played on the guitar, in a simple one-bar pattern, the thumb plays the bass notes on 1 and 2, while the fingers pluck the chords in unison on the two eighth notes of beat one, followed by the second sixteenth note of beat two. Two-measure patterns usually contain a syncopation into <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>measure.</b> Overall, the rhythm has a [...] "swaying" [...] feel rather than the [...] "swinging" [...] feel of jazz. As bossa nova composer Carlos Lyra describes it in his song [...] "Influência do Jazz", the samba rhythm moves [...] "side to side" [...] while jazz moves [...] "front to back". Bossa nova was also influenced by the blues, but because the most famous bossa novas lack the 12-bar structure characteristic of classic blues, {{as well as the}} statement, repetition and rhyming resolution of lyrics typical of the genre, bossa nova's affinity with the blues often passes unnoticed.|$|E

Although the first, third, and fourth notes (G3, C4, and Eb4) are identical in both modules, the second note reflects the change in harmony. In the first module, this note is the Bb3 third of the tonic harmony; in the module repetition, the A3 is the fifth of the dominant.
