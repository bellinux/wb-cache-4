Each sexual assault (excluding child abuse) costs $5,100 in <b>tangible</b> <b>losses</b> (lost productivity, medical and mental health care, police/fire services, and property damage) plus $81,400 in lost quality of life. This issue has been addressed in the Supreme Court. In his dissenting opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court case U.S. v. Morrison, Justice Souter explained that 75% of women never {{go to the movies}} alone at night and nearly 50% will not ride public transportation out of fear of rape or sexual assault. It also stated that less than 1% of victims collect damages and 50% of women lose their jobs or quit after the trauma. The court ruled in U.S. v. Morrison that Congress did not have the authority to enact part of the Violence Against Women Act because it did not have a direct impact on commerce. The Commerce Clause of Article I Section VII of the U.S. Constitution gives authority and jurisdiction to the Federal government in matters of interstate commerce.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study presents, discusses, {{and offers a}} solution to the problem od estimating the cost of a KIA. The different aspects of life valuation are discussed in terms of losses that result to both the military and society in general when a soldier is killed. These losses are further identified as to whether they fall into one or two categories, tangible or intangible. Although the study is mainly concerned with the <b>tangible</b> <b>losses,</b> a procedure is offered that will ensure inclusion of the intangible losses in the overall cost of a KIA. For the <b>tangible</b> <b>losses,</b> a mathematical model is developed for computing the economic loss of both an officer and enlisted KIA to society and to the military. The use of the model is demonstrated by way of three examples, the first of which determines the cost of an "average" KIA and the remaining two determine the upper and low cost bounds. A limited sensitivity analysis is conducted on the model and the results and the impact of the analysis is presented. The study concludes with how the model can best be used by Department of Defense decision makers. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In Telemedicine applications, for {{diagnostic}} purposes, it {{is essential}} that the video compression process causes no <b>tangible</b> <b>loss</b> of detail and introduces no noticeable artifacts which could be otherwise misinterpreted as being pathological in nature. On the other hand, due to the limitation of storage and transmission and the huge amount of medical video, high compression ratio is often required. Video coding exploits the high correlation between successive image frames to improve coding efficiency, which is achieved by motion estimation and motion compensation techniques. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating the high frequency component matching block motion estimation in H. 264 in order to improve video compression performance in telemedicine applications. Implementation using the H. 264 codec and thereby facilitating performance analysis, the experimental result indicates that high frequency component matching introduces a revolutionary improvement as a matching criterion for motion compensated predictive coding in real-time telemedicine applications.

This thesis details research incorporating a literature review followed by a two stage empirical investigation into the way that disinvestment decisions are made {{and whether or not}} the public should be involved. The first stage is a Q-Methodology study, the second is in-depth interviews. The population for the study is NHS health professionals (including managers and clinicians). 55 participants took part in the Q-study, and of these, 20 took part in follow-up interviews. The study highlighted three distinct perspectives, all of which supported public involvement. One was unequivocal in its support, another highlighted some potential disadvantages to involving the public and the third suggested that the public should have the freedom to choose whether they became involved. The follow up interviews re-iterated participants support for involvement but suggested that the public should become involved earlier and to a greater extent in those disinvestment decisions which affected more patients and/or resulted in a <b>tangible</b> <b>loss</b> of services. ...|$|R
40|$|Australian {{immigration}} policy is primarily focused on filling identified skill shortages in the labour market. For migrants themselves, {{the expectation is}} that they will maintain or indeed improve their previous income, and provide for their family, by finding a relevant technical or professional job. However, many do not. This leads to both economic loss as well as the less <b>tangible</b> <b>loss</b> of both professional identity and social status. So how do migrants respond to the difficulties they face in gaining work? This paper presents results from a PhD research project that focuses on the job search experiences of skilled migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds. Twenty-two migrant women and men living in south-east Queensland were interviewed twice over a twelve-month period about their job search experiences. As predicted by previous studies, they face barriers such as language skills, lack of local work experience and problems with recognition of qualifications. The research’s particular contribution is in revealing how skilled migrants, by necessity, develop strategies to combat such ‘barriers’ in order to find employment. The presentation will discuss their strategies and whether they prove successful in negotiating the labour market ‘labyrinth’ or whether, despite these strategies, they continue to experience downward occupational mobility. In addition, using intersectionality theory, the presentation will explore how job search strategies differ for migrant women and men, and the reasons for and implications of this.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedCurrently, fire department performance {{is measured in}} terms of <b>tangible</b> <b>loss</b> reduction, meaning lower dollar <b>losses</b> of <b>tangible</b> structures and contents equate with greater performance. This metric is flawed because it ignores the unmeasured performance of a fire department that saves nearby at-risk properties and businesses. Therefore, this thesis proposes a new metric: the saved ratio metric. It includes damages and business losses that may have occurred but did not, thanks to the suppression actions of an effective fire department. The saved ratio is defined as the ratio of the value that was saved at an incident versus the value of what was at risk. The total value of what was saved is defined as the total amount of what was at risk minus the total amount of what was lost, and total at risk is quantified using a new network model of at-risk property. Adjacent at-risk property is cast into a network model whereby structures are nodes and adjacency or direct contact is represented by links. Three major conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, the methodology of the real estate and economic industries can be used to quantify tangible and intangible value for structure fires. Second, network theory can be used to map the potential spread of a fire, allowing the user to identify which structures were saved or lost. Third, it is possible to estimate the return on investment added to the community from a fire suppression response model. Outstanding ThesisCaptain, Sacramento City Fire Departmen...|$|R
40|$|In June 1998 the U. S. Supreme Court issued three {{separate}} rulings regarding workplace sexual harassment. In an apparent victory for employers, {{the court ruled}} in one case that a victim must actually suffer a <b>tangible</b> <b>loss</b> (i. e., a demotion or unwelcome transfer) to establish a case for quid pro quo harassment. The court affirmed, moreover, that employers can absolve themselves of liability in hostile-environment cases by establishing a meaningful and effective policy against sexual harassment. Absent a meaningful policy, however, employers will be liable for a hostile environment created by supervisors. Thus, in another case, the court found an employer liable for workplace harassment because the employer pp. 14 - 21 failed to disseminate its existing policy and to follow its terms. Finally, in a same-sex harassment case, the court rejected the notion that egregious sexual harassment is per se unlawful, leaving {{open the possibility that}} a harasser who treats men and women equally, no matter how badly, could be found not guilty of unlawful behavior. Still, the court made it clear that an employer 2 ̆ 7 s best defense against supervisors 2 ̆ 7 sexual-harassment behavior is an effective prevention policy. Consequently, employers should draft a policy that (1) defines sexual harassment; (2) states the company prohibits such conduct; (3) provides a clear procedure for submitting claims, including the names of individuals involved in the resolution process; (4) states that those who complain or cooperate with an investigation will not be retaliated against; and (5) is disseminated to all new employees when they join the company, reissued to all employees each year, and posted in a conspicuous location in the workplace...|$|R

"July 2012 "This study investigated the economic benefits of an intensive family-based treatment (multisystemic therapy, MST) versus individual therapy (IT) using arrest data from 25 -year follow-ups of referred serious and violent juvenile offenders (n = 176) and their closest-in-age siblings (n = 110). Three categories of benefits were evaluated: (1) taxpayer benefits (i. e., avoided criminal justice system costs), (2) tangible benefits to crime victims (i. e., avoided <b>tangible</b> <b>losses),</b> and (3) intangible benefits to crime victims (i. e., avoided pain and suffering). Results indicated that reductions in criminality for juvenile offenders and siblings in the MST versus IT conditions were associated with substantial benefits to both taxpayers and crime victims. Cumulative benefits of MST over IT ranged up to $ 34, 955 per referred youth and up to $ 37, 433 per family (i. e., when siblings were included). Overall, it was estimated that every dollar spent on MST recovered up to $ 4. 98 in the years ahead by preventing future crimes. Sensitivity analyses also indicated that estimates of savings were robust to variations in crime victim intangible benefits, sibling juvenile arrest rates, and discount rates. The economic benefits of MST are important for administrators and policymakers to consider when allocating scarce financial resources to interventions for serious juvenile offenders...|$|E
40|$|South African society {{emerges from}} a {{political}} legacy that strove to create a dysfunctional society by implementing an official policy of racial discrimination, the effects {{of which can be}} observed in education, wealth distribution, employment, and settlement patterns amongst others. Therefore the challenge of statistical literacy is not only improving levels of competency in economics, science and technology, but also to address basic literacy and numeracy. An impressive budget allocation to education in recent times has helped primary education, but less for senior school where drop-out rates are high. An even much bigger challenge is adult illiteracy. In his address to the nation, the President emphasised the need for economic literacy in South Africa. The basic ingredient for this is statistical literacy; thus enhancing knowledge of mathematics and statistics can begin to address deficiencies in economic literacy. While there are programs for training statisticians, this paper confines itself largely to the broad based statistics awareness raising programmes. DEFINING LITERACY First, let us attempt to define what economic literacy means- it is the ability of individuals and or society to acknowledge, understand, and engage their material life circumstances like the economy; and subsequently, take a coherent set of strategic and operational steps aimed at addressing their situation. Such could be observed in progress or lack of it on levels of investment and spending. Second, statistical literacy is the ability of individuals and or society to read and understand quantitative information such as indices and indicators. The combined thrust of these literacies enables individuals and societies to act both at the economic and political fronts through social discourse. Economic literacy is predicated upon, and intricately intertwined with, statistical literacy. Literacy in this context represents a continuum from the very rudimentary to the most complex levels of comprehension of concepts, the latter being privy largely to the elite of society. It is also the ability of individuals and society to understand facts and numbers and relate them to <b>tangible</b> <b>losses</b> or benefits in their life circumstances, currently and or prospectively...|$|E
40|$|Pension {{reform has}} emerged as a major {{political}} issue in most advanced welfare states. Sluggish economic growth and rising unemployment put public pension systems under increasing financial pressure. In combination with a rapidly ageing population in the decades to come, these pressures render major adjustements in pension policy design inevitable, especially in countries with costly earnings-related benefit arrangements. However, timely and successful adjustement is anything but guaranteed. Both cuts of pension benefits and increases in contribution levels are bound to be highly unpopular and entail massive political risks. Thus, pension politics these days is as much about adjusting pension arrangements to changing demographic and economic conditions as it is about overcoming widespread political resistance to reforms that impose <b>tangible</b> <b>losses</b> on large parts of the population. This study reveals striking differences in the extent to which pension policy makers were able to generate a sufficient political support basis for their reform initiatives. As a consequence, pension reform outcomes reach from successful restructuring of existing pension arrangements {{all the way down to}} instances of outright policy failure. By tracing the political process of pension reform in Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Sweden since the late 1980 s the book also provides us with deeper insights about the factors that facilitate – or impede – social policy reforms in the context of fiscal austerity.

40|$|Flood risk {{mitigation}} usually requires a significant investment of public resources and cost-effectiveness should be ensured. The {{assessment of the}} benefits of hydraulic works requires the quantification of (i) flood risk in absence of measures, (ii) risk in presence of mitigation works, (iii) investments to achieve acceptable residual risk. In this work a building-scale is adopted to estimate direct <b>tangible</b> flood <b>losses</b> to several building classes (e. g. residential, industrial, commercial, etc.) and respective contents, exploiting various sources of public open data in a GIS environment. The impact simulations for assigned flood hazard scenarios are computed through the RASOR platform which allows for an extensive characterization of the properties and their vulnerability through libraries of stage-damage curves. Recovery and replacement costs are estimated based on insurance data, market values and socio-economic proxies. The methodology is applied to the case study of Florence (Italy) where a system of retention basins upstream of the city is under construction to reduce flood risk. Current flood risk in the study area (70 km 2) is about 170 Mio euros per year without accounting for people, infrastructures, cultural heritage and vehicles at risk. The monetary investment in the retention basins is paid off in about 5 years. However, the results show that although hydraulic works are cost-effective, a significant residual risk has to be managed and the achievement of the desired level of acceptable risk would require about 1 billion euros of investments...|$|R
40|$|Efficiently {{reducing}} {{natural hazard}} risks requires {{a thorough understanding}} of the costs of natural hazards. Current methods to assess these costs employ a variety of terminologies and approaches for different types of natural hazards and different impacted sectors. This may impede efforts to ascertain comprehensive and comparable cost figures. In order to strengthen the role of cost assessments in the development of integrated natural hazard management, a review of existing cost assessment approaches was undertaken. This review considers droughts, floods, coastal and Alpine hazards, and examines different cost types, namely direct <b>tangible</b> damages, <b>losses</b> due to business interruption, indirect damages, intangible effects, and the costs of risk mitigation. This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art cost assessment approaches and discusses key knowledge gaps. It shows that the application of cost assessments in practice is often incomplete and biased, as direct costs receive a relatively large amount of attention, while intangible and indirect effects are rarely considered. Furthermore, all parts of cost assessment entail considerable uncertainties due to insufficient or highly aggregated data sources, along with a lack of knowledge about the processes leading to damage and thus the appropriate models required. Recommendations are provided on how to reduce or handle these uncertainties by improving data sources and cost assessment methods. Further recommendations address how risk dynamics due to climate and socio-economic change can be better considered, how costs are distributed and ris...|$|R
40|$|The Multi-HAzard and MulTi-RIsK Assessment MethodS for Europe or MATRIX project (01. 10. 2010 to 31. 12. 2013), {{coordinated by}} the GFZ, {{set out to}} tackle {{some of the issues}} {{associated}} with multi-hazard and risk assessment. Disaster risk reduction (DDR) activities generally treat different natural hazards and their associated risks separately within what may be termed a "single-type" approach. However, this ignores the spatial and temporal interactions that often arise along the disaster risk chain. For instance, one hazardous event may trigger others, e. g., earthquakes causing tsunamis, or several different types may occur concurrently, e. g., severe weather and earthquakes. Considering vulnerability, an initial event would leave a community more susceptible to future, possibly different, hazards, e. g., an earthquake weakening buildings which are damaged further by windstorms. The temporal dimension may include changes in exposure, e. g., increased urbanisation, altering the total risk to an area, while repeated events lessen a community's resilience. Meanwhile, although losses are estimated by usually only considering direct economic losses or casualties, this ignores less <b>tangible</b> <b>losses</b> such as reduced business activity or the loss of cultural heritage. In short, the total risk estimated when incorporating interactions between multiple hazards and risks is likely to be greater than the sum of the individual parts. Hence, for a more comprehensive risk assessment paradigm, these, and other, interactions need to be considered. Therefore, MATRIX set out to develop concepts, methods, frameworks and tools for dealing with risk assessment within a multi-hazard and risk environment. The focus was on the hazards that most affect Europe, namely earthquakes, landslides, volcanos, tsunamis, wild fires, storms and fluvial and coastal flooding. Interactions at all the different levels were considered, such as cascading events and time dependency in vulnerability. The resulting products were applied at three test cases: Naples, Italy, the French West Indies, and Cologne, Germany. Considerable interaction with end-users was also undertaken, including identifying biases at the individual and institutional level which may hinder employing a multi-type framework for risk governance. This Scientific Technical Report presents two so-called "Reference reports" produced during the MATRIX project. These reports were provided to the European Commission as deliverables, namely D 8. 4 "MATRIX Results I and Reference Report" and D 8. 5 "MATRIX Results II and Reference Report". D 8. 4 presented a series of specific reports outlining the results of the project, written in a manner accessible not only to the specialist but with a broader audience in mind. D 8. 5 deals with the risk governance within a multi-hazard and risk context and has since been published. We therefore divide with document in two, where part 1 represented the outcomes presented in D 8. 4 while D 8. 5 forms part 2. We believe the MATRIX project was a very important step towards the goal of establishing the multi-hazard and risk environment as the norm within a European context, and we hope that the reader will benefit from the results presented here...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the last}} decades serious {{flooding}} events occurred {{in many parts of}} Europe and especially in 2005 the Austrian Federal Province of Tyrol was serious affected. These events in general and particularly the 2005 event have sensitised decision makers and the public. Beside discussions pertaining to protection goals and lessons learnt, the issue concerning potential consequences of extreme and severe flooding events has been raised. Additionally to the general interest of the public, decision makers of the insurance industry, public authorities, and responsible politicians are especially confronted with the question of possible consequences of extreme events. Answers thereof are necessary for the implementation of preventive appropriate risk management strategies. Thereby, property and liability losses reflect {{a large proportion of the}} direct <b>tangible</b> <b>losses.</b> These are of great interest for the insurance sector and can be understood as main indicators to interpret the severity of potential events. The natural scientific-technical risk analysis concept provides a predefined and structured framework to analyse the quantities of affected elements at risk, their corresponding damage potentials, and the potential losses. Generally, this risk concept framework follows the process steps hazard analysis, exposition analysis, and consequence analysis. Additionally to the conventional hazard analysis, the potential amount of endangered elements and their corresponding damage potentials were analysed and, thereupon, concrete losses were estimated. These took the specific vulnerability of the various individual elements at risk into consideration. The present flood risk analysis estimates firstly the general exposures of the risk indicators in the study area and secondly analyses the specific exposures and consequences of five extreme event scenarios. In order to precisely identify, localize, and characterize the relevant risk indicators of buildings, dwellings and inventory, vehicles, and individuals, a detailed geodatabase of the existing stock of elements and values was established on a single object level. Therefore, the localized and functional differentiated stock of elements was assessed monetarily on the basis of derived representative mean insurance values. Thus, well known difference factors between the analysis of the stock of elements and values on local and on regional scale could be reduced considerably. The spatial join of the results of the hazard analysis with the stock of elements and values enables the identification and quantification of the elements at risk and their corresponding damage potential. Thereupon, Extreme Scenario Losses (ESL) were analysed under consideration of different vulnerability approaches which describe the individual element's specific susceptibility. This results in scenario-specific ranges of ESL rather than in single values. The exposure analysis of the general endangerment in Tyrol identifies (i) 105 330 individuals, (ii) 20 272 buildings and 50 157 dwellings with a corresponding damage potential of approx. EUR 20 bn. and (iii) 62 494 vehicles with a corresponding damage potential of EUR 1 bn. Depending on the individual extreme event scenarios, the ESL solely to buildings and inventory vary between EUR 0. 9 – 1. 3 bn. for the scenario with the least ESL and EUR 2. 2 – 2. 5 bn. for the most serious scenarios. The correlation of the private property losses to buildings and inventory with further direct tangible loss categories on the basis of investigation after the event in 2005, results in potential direct tangible ESL of up to EUR 7. 6 bn. Apart from the specific study results a general finding shows that beside the further development of modelling capabilities and scenario concepts, the key to considerably decrease uncertainties of integral flood risk analyses is the development and implementation of more precise methods. These are to determine the stock of elements and values and to evaluate the vulnerability or susceptibility of affected structures to certain flood characteristics more differentiated...|$|E
40|$|Žalos instituto esmė yra visiško žalos atlyginimo principas (restitutio in integrum). Lietuvos Respublikos civilinio kodekso 6. 251 straipsnyje įtvirtinta nuostata, jog padaryti nuostoliai (turtinės žalos piniginė išraiška), turi būti atlyginti visiškai, išskyrus atvejus, kai specialūs įstatymai ar sutartis nustato ribotą atsakomybę. Tačiau visiško žalos atlyginimo principas gali būti ribojamas Lietuvos Respublikos civilinio kodekso straipsniuose nustatytų kriterijų, į kuriuos teismas gali atsižvelgti. Vienas iš tokių kriterijų yra žalą padariusio asmens turtinė padėtis. Taigi teismui yra suteikiama diskrecija nukrypti nuo visiško žalos atlyginimo principo remiantis žalą padariusio asmens turtine padėtimi. Tokiu atveju pagrįstai kyla klausimas ar nėra pažeidžiamos žalą patyrusio asmens teisės tais atvejais, kai atlygintinos žalos (tiek turtinės tiek neturtinės) dydis sumažinamas, arba žalą sukėlusio asmens, kai yra galimybė priteisti didesnį žalos atlyginimą. Paprastai žalą sukėlusio asmens turtinės padėties kriterijus Lietuvos teismų praktikoje vertinamas aspektu ar žalą sukėlusio asmens turtinė padėtis yra pakankamai sunki, kad teismas galėtų sumažinti žalos atlyginimo dydį. Toks žalos sumažinimas turėtų užkirsti kelią galimiems sunkiems padariniams, kurie kiltų žalą sukėlusiam asmeniui iš jo priteisiant kompensaciją didesnę nei jis būtų pajėgus atlyginti. Kita vertus žalą patyrusiam asmeniui taip pat gali kilti sunkūs padariniai nevisiškai atlyginus jo patirtą žalą, jei žalos dydis būtų sumažintas. Be abejo tokiu atveju teismas vadovaujasi bendraisiais proporcingumo, teisingumo, sąžiningumo, protingumo principais. Kitaip tariant visa diskrecija su tam tikromis gairėmis vis dėlto paliekama teismui, kur sprendimas vis tik priimamas pagal proceso metu teisėjo susiformuotą vidinį įsitikinimą. The {{essence of}} damage {{institution}} {{is the principle}} of full reimbursement of damage (restitutio in integrum). It is provided in the article 6. 251 of the Civil Code of the Republic of Lithuania (hereinafter – LR Civil Code) that the caused losses (pecuniary expression of tangible damage) have to be reimbursed in full, except when the special laws or contract provides limited liability. According to the paragraph 2 of the article 6. 263 of the LR Civil Code, the damage caused to the person and property, as well as intangible damage (in certain cases) has to be reimbursed in full. With regard to such legal regulation, the conclusion should {{be made that the}} principle of full reimbursement of damages is valid in cases of contractual and tort liability and should be applied for reimbursement of <b>tangible</b> (<b>losses)</b> and intangible damage in general meaning. However it is necessary to note that when the amount of damage due to reimbursement is solved, the aforementioned the principle of full reimbursement of damage may be limited by criteria provided in other articles of the LR Civil Code, which have {{to be taken into account}} by the court. One of such criteria is the material situation of the person, who has caused damage. Therefore the court is granted discretion to deviate from the principle of full reimbursement of damage on the ground of material situation of the person, who has caused damage. So the reasonable question arises whether the rights of the person, who has incurred damage, are not violated in the cases when the amount of damage due to reimbursement (tangible and intangible) is reduced in accordance with the paragraph 3 of the article 6. 282 of the LR Civil Code, or whether the rights of the person, who has caused damage, are not violated when there is a possibility to adjudge bigger reimbursement in accordance with the paragraph 1 of the article 6. 250 of the LR Civil Code. With regard to the function of damage reimbursement, three main positions may be distinguished: 1) damage reimbursement as compensation for the aggrieved person, 2) damage compensation as prevention with regard to other third persons, or 3) damage reimbursement as sanction for the person, who has caused damage. It is recognized in the Lithuania legal system that damage reimbursement has a compensatory function, i. e. in essence its purpose is to return the aggrieved person to the situation before damage. Therefore it is considered that damage has to be evaluated precisely and reimbursed in such an amount as incurred by the person factually. Too high reimbursement of damage would result in improvement of material situation of the person and this would lead to formation of other legal relations between the parties (e. g., unlawful enrichment). On the other hand, the principle of full reimbursement of damage consolidated in the LR Civil Code must ensure that the damage reimbursement would not be too small. Regardless to this, the conditions are provided in the LR Civil Code, which allow reducing the amount of damage due to reimbursement. One of such conditions is the material situation of parties. Usually this criterion is assessed in the Lithuanian case law with regard to evaluation whether the material situation of the person, who has caused damage, is severe enough to reduce the amount of reimbursable damage by the court’s decision. Such reduction of damage should prevent probable severe consequences, which would be caused to the person, who had caused damage, when the compensation exceeding his/her capacities was adjudged. The provisions, which allow reducing the amount of damage because of severe material situation, were contained in the civil code of the Lithuanian SSR, as well. Of course, it was stated directly that the criterion of material situation may lead only to reduction of damage. It is not directly stated in all the norms related to this criterion in the current Civil Code of the Republic of Lithuania that damage may be only reduced. However, there are no cases encountered in practice of the Lithuanian Supreme Court when the amount of reimbursable damage would be increased on the ground of material situation of the person, who has caused damage. With regard to the case law formed by the cassation court when the amount of damage reimbursement is considered in the cases related to damage caused to health and life, the court assesses requests to reduce damage on the ground of difficult material situation of the person, who has caused damage, very critically and takes into account not only the current situation but also all the possibilities of future income and perspectives of that person. Therefore the court reduces the amount of reimbursement very rarely in such cases on the ground of this criterion. However, when the damage is not related to personal health or life, the courts are more liberal to apply the criterion of financial situation of the person with regard to reduction of damage reimbursement. Yet in any case, it is always necessary to remember that this evaluation criterion is not absolute and usually is evaluated within other circumstances. Usually the decision to reduce amount of reimbursement is made not solely on the ground of that criterion, although it has impact, without any doubt. On the other hand, the person, who incurs damage, also may encounter severe consequences if the damage is not reimbursed in full and is reduced. Of course, in such cases the court follows general principles of proportionality, justice, fairness, and reasonability. In other words, the discretion remains with the court (in application with certain guidelines), where the decision is made according to the internal belief of the judge formed in the course of proceedings. As the Lithuanian courts are cautious to reduce the damage reimbursement due to the material situation of the person, who has caused damage, after having assessed the case circumstances very carefully, in order to ensure equality between the parties with regard to all the aspects, the material situation of both – the person, who has caused damage and the person, who has incurred damage, has to be taken into account, so the amount of damage could be not only reduced but also increased. However, it is necessary not to forget that the Lithuanian legal system recognizes compensatory and not punitive or preventive function of damage reimbursement, so such an approach would be contrary to general conception. Therefore the largest country of common law – the United States of America – recognizes all three goals of damage reimbursement. In case of such a model the damage reimbursement may be divided substantially into two main sorts: compensatory damage (when the function for actually incurred damage is implemented) and punitive damage (that is applied in order to punish the person, who has caused damage, and to prevent similar situations). The European countries of civil law, Lithuania including, are not ready for such damage reimbursement system yet. According to the formed long-term practice, culture and legal customs, such a system could even be detrimental in modern Europe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effects of}} {{electric}} service interruptions resulting from se-vere power outages were investigated and analyzed. Two approaches {{have been developed}} and used. One is based on customers survey that mainly in-vestigates the preparatory actions that a consumer may take to reduce the effects of outages. The other one {{is based on a}} mathematical model that fo-cuses on the value of foregone leisure and ceased activities should outages occur in specific periods. The residential consumer in the city of Riyadh has been selected as a practical case to conduct this study. It has been found that this sector- which constitutes about 700 / 0 of the Saudi Consolidated Electric Company in the central region (SCECO-c) energy consumers- will suffer <b>tangible</b> and intangible <b>losses</b> should outages occur, particularly in summer time, and last for longer durations. This paper provides new information and data {{that can be used in}} a broad range of cost-benefit analyses in power system planning, design and operation. 1...|$|R
40|$|It {{is argued}} that {{estimating}} the damage costs of a certain benchmark climate change is not sufficient. What is needed are cost functions and confidence intervals. Although these are contained in the integrated models and their technical manuals, this paper brings them into the open in order to stimulate discussion. After briefly reviewing the benchmark climate change damage costs, region-specific cost functions are presented which distinguish <b>tangible</b> from intangible <b>losses</b> and the losses due to a changing climate from those due to a changed climate. Furthermore, cost functions {{are assumed to be}} quadratic, as an approximation of the unknown but presumably convex functions. Results from the damage module of the integrated climate economy model FUND are presented, Next, uncertainties are incorporated and expected damages are calculated. It is shown that because of convex loss functions and right-skewed uncertainties, the risk premium is substantial, calling for more action than analysis based on best-guess estimates. The final section explores some needs for further scientific research...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEfficiently {{reducing}} {{natural hazard}} risks requires {{a thorough understanding}} of the costs of natural hazards. Current methods to assess these costs employ a variety of terminologies and approaches for different types of natural hazards and different impacted sectors. This may impede efforts to ascertain comprehensive and comparable cost figures. In order to strengthen the role of cost assessments in the development of integrated natural hazard management, a review of existing cost assessment approaches was undertaken. This review considers droughts, floods, coastal and Alpine hazards, and examines different cost types, namely direct <b>tangible</b> damages, <b>losses</b> due to business interruption, indirect damages, intangible effects, and the costs of risk mitigation. This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art cost assessment approaches and discusses key knowledge gaps. It shows that the application of cost assessments in practice is often incomplete and biased, as direct costs receive a relatively large amount of attention, while intangible and indirect effects are rarely considered. Furthermore, all parts of cost assessment entail considerable uncertainties due to insufficient or highly aggregated data sources, along with a lack of knowledge about the processes leading to damage and thus the appropriate models required. Recommendations are provided on how to reduce or handle these uncertainties by improving data sources and cost assessment methods. Further recommendations address how risk dynamics due to climate and socio-economic change can be better considered, how costs are distributed and risks transferred, and in what ways cost assessment can function as part of decision support...|$|R
