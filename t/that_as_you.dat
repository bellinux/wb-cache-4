500|$|Production {{designer}} Carey Meyer {{built the}} ship Serenity {{in two parts}} (one for each level) as a complete set with ceilings and practical lighting installed {{as part of the}} set that the cameras could use along with moveable parts. The two-part set also allowed the second unit to shoot in one section while the actors and first unit worked undisturbed in the other. As Whedon recalled: [...] "...you could pull it away or move something huge, so that you could get in and around everything. That meant the environment worked for us and there weren't a lot of adjustments that needed to be made." [...] There were other benefits to this set design. One was that it allowed the viewers to feel they were really in a ship. For Whedon, the design of the ship was crucial in defining the known space for the viewer, and that there were not [...] "fourteen hundred decks and a holodeck and an all-you-can-eat buffet in the back". He wanted to convey that it was utilitarian and that it was [...] "beat-up but lived-in and ultimately, it was home". As Joss Whedon discusses in the DVD commentary, each room represented a feeling or character, usually conveyed by the paint color. He explains <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> move {{from the back of the}} ship in the engine room, toward the front of the ship to the bridge, the colors and mood progress from extremely warm to cooler. Besides evoking a mood associated with the character who spends most time in each area, the color scheme also alludes to the heat generated in the tail of the ship.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, <b>that's</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> look at it. When I {{realized}} {{what was going on}} I wanted to leave, and, I repeat, had the chief actress been an old hag or the usual sloven who plays this game, I would have fled; but she was as beautiful as a statue as she lay there, professedly in deep trance." ...|$|R

6000|$|Hugh's words exhaled such a {{sense of}} peril as to draw at once Lady Grace. [...] "Ah, but if we're above <b>that</b> here, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> know------!" ...|$|R

"'Twas civil, brother Cap," [...] {{returned}} the other, lowering {{his hand from}} the military salute which his pride as a soldier had induced him to return,--"'twas civil, and <b>that's</b> <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can expect from a Frenchman.

6000|$|... 'Why, <b>that's</b> true, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> say,' replied Glossin. 'And yet if {{she could}} be carried over to Zealand, or Hamburgh, or--or--anywhere else, you know, it were as well.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is a well-laid plot, Charlie, {{and does}} {{credit to the}} scoundrel who planned it.
