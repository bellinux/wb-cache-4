50|$|In gas {{tungsten}} arc welding (GTAW), inert gases {{are used to}} shield the tungsten from contamination. It also shields the fluid metal (created from the arc) from the reactive gases in air which can cause porosity in <b>the</b> solidified <b>weld</b> <b>puddle.</b> Inert gases are also used in gas metal arc welding (GMAW) for welding non-ferrous metals. Some gases which are not usually considered inert but which behave like inert gases in all the circumstances likely to be encountered in some use can often be used as a substitute for an inert gas. This is useful when an appropriate pseudo-inert gas can be found which is inexpensive and common. For example, carbon dioxide is sometimes used in gas mixtures for GMAW because it is not reactive to <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> pool created by arc welding. But it is reactive to the arc. The more carbon dioxide that is added to the inert gas, such as argon, will increase your penetration. The amount of carbon dioxide is often determined by what kind of transfer you will be using in GMAW. The most common is spray arc transfer, and the most commonly used gas mixture for spray arc transfer is 90% argon and 10% carbon dioxide.

40|$|Welding as a {{fabrication}} {{technique is}} commonly used to join components in many industries, among which the aircraft and automotive industries, ship building, and construction industry. After <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> process <b>the</b> joined component is inevitably internally stressed, even when the component is not externally loaded. These stresses are called residual stresses. The residual stresses combine with applied loads {{and can lead to}} unexpected failure of the component and the entire structure if the magnitude and the spatial distribution of them is unknown. In the study of the structural integrity of a welded component, it is essential to know the residual stresses caused by <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> process. They can be determined experimentally and simulated computationally, both on various ways. The most widely used modelling technique is that of the thermo-mechanical Finite Element (FE) models where the coupled thermo-mechanical differential equations describing the problem in <b>the</b> <b>welded</b> component are solved. For an accurate, physically based model, {{it is important to understand}} and quantify the related physical phenomena that occur in <b>welding.</b> <b>The</b> objective of this thesis was to study <b>the</b> prediction of <b>welding</b> stresses by macroscopic FE modelling. The innovative part is that the microstructural effect of crystallographic texture development in the fusion zone of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> after solidification, has been investigated and incorporated in the model. <b>The</b> texture in <b>welds</b> has been described quantitatively by EBSD measurements, which allowed to obtain numerical results for the material properties. These results have been used to define an anisotropic <b>weld</b> <b>puddle</b> material after solidification, and to investigate the influence of this anisotropy on deformations and residual stresses. To incorporate the texture in a FE model, 3 steps have to be followed. Firstly, the material properties in the fusion zone of welds on grain size level, namely the crystallographic orientations, have to be quantified. Secondly, the effect of these microscopic properties on the macroscopic properties, the anisotropy on component size level, have to be calculated. Thirdly, the resulting macroscopic anisotropy has to be introduced in the FE model to predict <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> stresses. It is shown that the thermal history of a weld can be modelled accurately by a thermal heat input model. Modelled results have been compared with experiments by comparing thermocouple measurements with temperature predictions at the thermocouple positions, as well as comparing the observed fusion boundary profile with the predicted one. In this work, the fusion zone has experimentally been determined by means of micrographs, and by means of the difference in microstructure between the melted fusion zone and the base material. A good agreement has been found between modelled temperatures and thermocouple measurements, and between predicted and observed fusion zone dimensions. It is shown that upon solidification of the fusion zone of austenitic welds, a strong crystallographic texture arises, with a preferential growth in the solidification direction.

40|$|In 1997, the United States [NASA] and the Paton Electric Welding Institute are {{scheduled}} to cooperate in a flight demonstration on the U. S. Space Shuttle to demonstrate the feasibility of welding in space for a possible repair option for the International Space Station Alpha. This endeavor, known as the International Space Welding Experiment (ISWE), will involve astronauts performing various welding exercises such as brazing, cutting, welding, and coating using an electron beam space welding system that {{was developed by the}} E. O. Paton Electric Welding Institute (PWI), Kiev Ukraine. This electron beam welding system known as the "Universal Weld System" consists of hand tools capable of brazing, cutting, autogeneous welding, and coating using an 8 kV (8000 volts) electron beam. The electron beam hand tools have also been developed by the Paton Welding Institute with greater capabilities than the original hand tool, including filler wire feeding, to be used with the Universal Weld System on the U. S. Space Shuttle Bay as part of ISWE. The hand tool(s) known as the Ukrainian Universal Hand [Electron Beam Welding] Tool (UHT) will be utilized for the ISWE Space Shuttle flight welding exercises to perform welding on various metal alloy samples. A total of 61 metal alloy samples, which include 304 stainless steel, Ti- 6 AI- 4 V, 2219 aluminum, and 5456 aluminum alloys, have been provided by NASA for the ISWE electron beam welding exercises using the UHT. These samples were chosen to replicate both the U. S. and Russian module materials. The ISWE requires extravehicular activity (EVA) of two astronauts to perform the space shuttle electron beam welding operations of the 61 alloy samples. This study was undertaken to determine if a hazard could exist with ISWE during the electron beam welding exercises in the Space Shuttle Bay using the Ukrainian Universal Weld System with the UHT. The safety issue has been raised with regard to molten metal detachments as a result of several possible causes such as welder procedural error, externally applied impulsive forces(s), filler wire entrainment and snap-out, cutting expulsion, and puddle expulsion. Molten metal detachment from either the weld/cut substrate or weld wire could present harm to a astronaut in the space environment it the detachment was ti burn through the fabric of the astronaut Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMC). In this paper an experimental test was performed in a 4 ft. x 4 ft. vacuum chamber at MSFC enabling protective garment to be exposed to the molten metal drop detachments to over 12 inches. The chamber was evacuated to vacuum levels of at least 1 x 10 (exp - 5) torr (50 micro-torr) during operation of the 1. 0 kW Universal Hand Tool (UHT). The UHT was manually operated at the power mode appropriate for each material and thickness. The space suit protective welding garment, made of Teflon fabric (10 oz. per yard) with a plain weave, was placed {{on the floor of the}} vacuum chamber to catch the molten metal drop detachments. A pendulum release mechanism consisting of four hammers, each weighing approximately 3. 65 lbs, was used to apply an impact forces to the weld sample/plate during both the electron beam welding and cutting exercises. Measurements were made of the horizontal fling distances of the detached molten metal drops. The volume of a molten metal drop can also be estimated from the size of the cut. Utilizing equations, calculations were made to determine chande in surafec area (Delat a(surface)) for 304 stainless steel for cutting based on measurements of metal drop sizes at the cut edges. For the cut sample of 304 stainless steel based on measurement of the drop size at the edge, Delta-a(surface) was determined to be 0. 0054 2 in. Calculations have indicated only a small amount of energy is required to detach a liquid metal drop. For example, approximately only 0. 000005 ft-lb of energy is necessary to detach a liquid metal steel drop based on the above theoretical analysis. However, some of the energy will be absorbed by the plate before it reaches the metal drop. Based on the theoretical calculations, it was determined that during a weld cutting exercise, the titanium alloy would be the most difficult to detach molten metal droplets followed by stainless steel and then by aluminum. The results of the experimental effort have shown that molten metal will detach if large enough of a hammer blow is applied to the weld sample plate during the full penetration welding and cutting exercises. However, no molten metal detachments occurred as a result of the filler wire snap-out tests from <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> <b>puddle</b> since it was too difficult to cause the metal to flick-out from the pool. Molten metal detachments, though not large in size, did result from the direct application of the electron beam on the end of the filler weld wire...|$|E
40|$|The {{safety issue}} has been raised with regards to {{potential}} molten metal detachments from the weld pool and cold filler wire during electron beam welding in space. This investigation was undertaken to evaluate if molten metal could detach and {{come in contact with}} astronauts and burn through the fabric of the astronauts' Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) during electron beam welding in space. Molten metal detachments from either the weld/cut substrate or weld wire could present harm to a astronaut if the detachment was to burn through the fabric of the EMU. Theoretical models were developed to predict the possibility and size of the molten metal detachment hazards during the electron beam welding exercises at Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The primary molten metal detachment concerns were those cases of molten metal separation from the metal surface due to metal cutting, weld pool splashing, entrainment and release of molten metal due to filler wire snap-out from <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> <b>puddle,</b> and molten metal accumulation and release {{from the end of the}} weld wire. Some possible ways of obtaining molten metal drop detachments would include an impulse force, or bump, to the weld sample, cut surface, or filler wire. Theoretical models were developed for these detachment concerns from principles of impact and kinetic energies, surface tension, drop geometry, surface energies, and particle dynamics. The surface tension represents the force opposing the liquid metal drop from detaching whereas the weight of the liquid metal droplet represents a force that is tending to detach the molten metal drop. Theoretical calculations have indicated that only a small amount of energy is required to detach a liquid metal drop; however, much of the energy of an impact is absorbed in the sample or weld plate before it reaches the metal drop on the cut edge or surface. The tendency for detachment is directly proportional to the weld pool radius and metal density and inversely proportional to the surface tension of the liquid metal. For a detachment the initial kinetic energy of the weld pool with respect to the plate has to exceed the energy to form the extra surface required for the detachment of the pool. The difficulty is in transferring the energy from the point of impact through the plate and sample to the cut edge. It is likely that not all of the kinetic energy is available for detaching the pool; some may be sequestered in weld pool oscillations. The coefficient of restitution for the collision will be lower than one if irreversible deformation, for example plastic flow deformation, takes place during the collision. Thus determining the amount of energy from an impact that actually reaches the molten metal droplet is critical. Various molten metal detachment scenarios were tested experimentally in an enclosed vacuum chamber using the Ukrainian Universal Hand Tool, an electron beam welder designed for space welding. The experimental testing was performed in a 4 ft. X 4 ft. vacuum chamber at Marshall Space Flight Center, evacuated to vacuum levels of at least 50 microTorr, and also some welding garment material was utilized to observe the effect of the molten metal detachments on the material. A "carillon" apparatus consisting of four pendulum hammer strikers, each weighing approximately 3. 65 lbs, raised to predetermined specific heights was used to apply an impact force to the weld sample/plate during electron beam welding and cutting exercises. The strikers were released by switching on an electric motor to rotate a pin holding wires retaining the strikers at desired heights. The specimens were suspended so as to be free to respond to the blows with a sudden velocity increment. The specimens were mounted on a hinged plate for minimizing effective mass with the option to fasten it down so as to raise its effective mass closer to that anticipated for an actual space welding scenario. Measurements were made of the impact energy and the horizontal fling distances of the detached metal drops. It was not particularly easy to generate the detachments for this experiment. This document presents the details of the theoretical modeling effort and a summary of the experimental effort to measure molten metal drop detachments from terrestrial electron beam welding in the enclosed vacuum chamber. The results of the experimental effort have shown that molten metal detachments can occur from the sample/weld plate only if a sufficiently large impact force is applied to the weld plate. A "weld pool detachment parameter" was determined to indicate whether detachment would occur. Detachment can be either full or partial (dripping), Partial detachment means that the weld pool detached from one side of the liquid-solid boundary so as to leave a hole at the puddle site but remained attached over part of the liquid-solid boundary and dripped down the plate with no fully detached material detected. Full detachment, however, does not necessarily mean that the whole pool fully detached; in some cases only a smaller portion of the pool detached, the remainder dripping down the plate. The weld pool detachment parameter according to theory and according to the empirical data allows a determination of whether full detachments might occur. Theoretical calculations indicated titanium alloy would be the most difficult from which to detach molten metal droplets followed by stainless steel and then by aluminum. The experimental results were for the most part consistent with the theoretical analysis and predictions. The above theory is applicable to other situations as desired for assessing the potential for molten metal detachments...|$|E

However, <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> residual stress perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> axis is severely underestimated in the plane plate compared with the cylindrical structure.

However, a test specimen for an 8 m diameter cylinder with a plate thickness of 35 mm needs only to have a segment width of approximately 1. 3 m to reflect the stress in the real structure. <b>The</b> <b>weld</b> residual stress perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> axis in <b>the</b> vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> toe is governed by the depositing of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> bead adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> toe, neglecting <b>the</b> accumulated strain from <b>the</b> previous deposited <b>weld</b> beads in <b>the</b> multi-pass joint <b>weld.</b> Introducing tensile straining perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> axis during <b>the</b> entire <b>welding</b> procedure reduces <b>the</b> weld-induced residual stress after completed <b>welding.</b> <b>The</b> plastic zone of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> area will be subjected to compressive strain after completed welding, which in turn will reduce <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> residual stress.

Visual sensing {{is one of the}} most attractive approaches to detect <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> position, which provides valuable information to control the arc following the expected path. <b>The</b> <b>weld</b> edge is main characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> position image, here the visual technique for detecting <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> position based on Hough transformation is proposed. <b>The</b> <b>weld</b> position can be detected and recognized through Hough transformation, while <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> edge image is detected using the Canny operators. And Hough transformation is modified based on <b>the</b> actual <b>weld</b> situation. Therefore, <b>the</b> precision of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> detection can be improved. From the analysis of experiments, it has been proved that the proposed method can detect the width and the center of <b>the</b> <b>weld,</b> and is suitable for the seam tracking system based on the computer vision...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> {{mechanical}} heterogeneity on the damage evolution of notched round-bar tensile specimens were investigated numerically using a fully coupled elastic-plastic damage finite element method. Some parameters reflecting <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> mechanical heterogeneity such as strength mismatching, rupture strain and weld metal width {{were taken into}} account to study their effects on the damage evolution of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> metal. <b>The</b> calculation {{results show that the}} damage evolution of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> metal is affected strongly by <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> mechanical heterogeneity. <b>The</b> damage evolution of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> metal becomes larger with the decrease of both the rupture strain and yielding stress of the base metal. The effects of the mechanical properties of the base metal on the damage evolution of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> metal decreases with the increase of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> metal width...|$|R
