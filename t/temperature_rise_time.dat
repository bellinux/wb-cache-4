Heat transfer to the surrounding liquid is mainly caused by conduction, not by convection and radiation mechanisms.

40|$|One of the {{outstanding}} problems for a next step fusion device is {{the handling of the}} power fluxes into the divertor, in particular regarding fast transient heat deposition by edge localised modes (ELMs). For a next step fusion device, such as ITER, type-I ELMy H-Mode is the reference discharge and therefore of particular interest. At JET a thermography system with high time resolution is able to resolve temperature evolution during and between ELM periods; here, the analysis is focussed so far on type-I ELMy H-Mode discharges with ELM frequencies of 10 – 35 Hz. Influences from surface layers on the target tiles are investigated in special discharges and taken into account. Results about the distribution of ELM and inter-ELM power deposition on the inner and outer divertor target plates are presented. Additionally, the characteristic ELM power deposition time (or <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> <b>time)</b> and its dependence on pedestal parameters are studied.

We find {{correlations between}} fluence, peak flux, the occurrence of radius expansion and the presence of burst oscillations, and the position of the source in the color-color diagram. The radius expansion bursts with and without burst oscillations differ both with respect to where they occur in the color-color diagram and in how the radius expansion takes place.

By correlating dynamic water states data to feedstock mechanical properties and treatment process characteristics, the bound water being the excellent plasticizer that reduced the mechanical strength of fibers by over 30 %, was conducive to treatment; while, the free water presenting buffering effects in treatment by hindering heat transfer which was reflected by the increase of <b>temperature</b> <b>rising</b> <b>time</b> by 1. 29 folds and steam consumption by 2. 18 folds, was not conducive.

40|$|To {{disclose}} {{a possible}} effect of duration of pulsed laser heat stimuli on Adelta nociceptor responses, skin temperature profiles, brain evoked potentials and pain perception. We used a laser stimulator which {{works in the}} millisecond range and allows us to change {{the duration of the}} pulse while keeping the total energy of the stimulus constant. In 10 healthy volunteers, we measured the intensity of perceived pain with a 0 - 10 scale and the latency and amplitude of the early N 1 and late N 2 components of the scalp potentials evoked by laser pulses of equal energy and three different stimulus durations (2, 10, and 20 ms). Using a specifically developed pyrometer with a temporal resolution lower than 1 ms we also measured stimulus-induced changes of skin temperature. Stimulus duration significantly influenced <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> <b>times,</b> pain perception, and brain potentials. Shorter stimulus durations yielded steeper slopes in the skin temperature profiles and higher pain ratings, shortened the latency of the N 1 and N 2 components, and increased the amplitude of N 1.

Then, the stiffness modulus of the mixtures was evaluated by the Indirect Tensile Stiffness Modulus test, at various <b>temperatures</b> and <b>rise</b> <b>times.</b> The Indirect Tensile Fatigue Test, concluded the experimental trial. Depending on the RAP sources and content, the bituminous mixtures made with RAP aggregates showed improved indirect tensile strength as well as higher stiffness modulus values and fatigue resistance, with respect to the control asphalt concrete prepared with natural aggregate. © RILEM 201...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExperiments {{were carried}} out to explore the {{pyrolysis}} of CHF 3 fire extinguishing agent in a stainless tubular reactor at atmospheric pressure and temperatures from 600 to 850 °C versus various residence times of 2 - 15 s. The decomposition of CHF 3 commence around 650 °C. As reaction <b>temperature</b> <b>rises</b> and residence <b>time</b> prolongs, the pyrolysis of CHF 3 is intensified, which makes the concentration of CHF 3 plummet, the yields of main products C 3 F 6, i-C 4 F 8 and HF increase and the yield of C 2 F 4 decreases after its peak. The explanations {{of the formation of}} these products are proposed by the formation, dimerization, trimerization, disproportionation and other reactions of CF 2 :, which meets well with the various yields of HF and other experimental results...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe present {{simulations}} {{of the impact}} of climate change on global water scarcity for five greenhouse gas emissions mitigation policy scenarios and compare them with a business-as-usual emissions scenario. A global water scarcity model is driven by climate change projections from 21 global climate models (GCMs). An aggressive policy scenario that gives a 50 % chance of avoiding a 2 °C global-mean <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> from pre-industrial <b>times</b> could avoid almost 40 % of the business as usual global impacts by 2100. However, mitigation policy does not completely eliminate the impacts of climate change. For any given GCM, the avoided impacts are affected more by the year at which emissions peak than to the rate at which emissions are subsequently reduced and the uncertainty across the 21 forcing GCMs is large...|$|R
