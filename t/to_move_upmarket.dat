2500|$|The automaker decided <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>upmarket,</b> and in 1930 {{launched}} {{a line of}} cars called Great Eight. Hudson Eights were [...] "often luxurious, and usually smooth, effortless performers" [...] powered by a new for 1930 straight-eight engine that would be produced through 1952. Total production in 1930 for Hudson Motors fell by almost 40% to 113,898 units.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} renamed Falcon Cars in 1961 <b>to</b> reflect the <b>move</b> <b>upmarket</b> {{and the four}} seat Bermuda was introduced. About the same time, the 1000 was developed. This was later marketed as the Peregrine.|$|R

It responds to the stiff competition from other fast-food restaurants, offering higher quality burgers and more variety, by attempting <b>to</b> <b>move</b> more <b>upmarket</b> by expanding its menu and refitting restaurants. It announces it is withdrawing from three countries (including Bolivia) and closing 175 underperforming restaurants.|$|R
50|$|His {{original}} Therry st. shopfront studio off Queen Victoria Market was {{the unusual}} setting for informal gatherings of Melbourne's radicals and progressives.

2500|$|In 1957, Cadillac {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>upmarket,</b> {{creating the}} hand-built Series 70 Eldorado Brougham. It featured self-levelling suspension, [...] "memory seat" [...] function, and an all-transistor signal-seeking car radio that {{was produced by}} GM's Delco Radio and which was available as standard equipment for the 1957 Eldorado Brougham models. While the car showed Cadillac's technological prowess, it only sold 904 units.|$|E
50|$|Marketing {{opportunities}} {{were identified}} in Europe where Alfa Romeo's locally designed attempt <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>upmarket</b> had made little impact on the competition from Bavaria: the Brazilian Alfa Romeo was offered briefly in 1981 under the designation Alfa Rio and distributed by Alfa Romeo Germany. Additionally, around 600 of the cars were shipped to The Netherlands.|$|E

50|$|In 1929, Lucien Tissot-Dupont {{was invited}} to New York by Louis Cartier to present his travel cases in their 5th Avenue shop.

2500|$|This was {{the result}} of a {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the Clio <b>upmarket.</b> It also brings the trademark [...] "Renault Card" [...] keyless immobiliser to the Clio for the first time. [...] The new Clio achieved a 5-star EuroNCAP safety rating, joining the rest of Renault's family at the maximum safety rating (with the exception of the Kangoo and the Twingo). Sales began throughout Europe in October 2005.|$|R
2500|$|Ford Motor Company {{became a}} {{publicly}} traded corporation on January 17, 1956, and thus was no longer entirely owned {{by members of the}} Ford family. The company was now able to sell cars according to current market trends following the sellers' market of the postwar years. Ford's new management compared the company's roster of makes with that of General Motors [...] and Chrysler, and concluded that Lincoln was competing not with Cadillac, but with Oldsmobile, Buick and DeSoto. Ford developed a plan <b>to</b> <b>move</b> Lincoln <b>upmarket,</b> with the Continental broken out as a separate make at the top of Ford's product line, and to add a premium/intermediate vehicle to the intermediate slot vacated by Lincoln.|$|R

50|$|Recently nationalised, {{and enjoying}} booming sales with their Renault 4CV, Renault {{management}} {{at the end of}} the 1940s sought <b>to</b> <b>move</b> their business <b>upmarket.</b> Company strategy called for a robust functional vehicle, equally at home in the cities or the countryside, and appealing also to overseas markets in remaining parts of the French empire. With colonial and rural customers in its sights, the car was named Colorale, a portmanteau of the (French) words ‘COLOniale’ and ‘ruRALE’.|$|R
5000|$|Although the Rekord D shared its {{wheelbase}} {{with its}} predecessor, {{in other respects}} it respected the tendency of Opel Rekords <b>to</b> <b>move</b> slightly <b>upmarket</b> with each new model. The Rekord D was heavier than the Rekord C and the previous model's 1492 cc engine was no longer offered. The smallest power unit at launch, {{and the one that}} would be the top seller with this model, was a 1698 cc engine with the low 8.2:1 compression ratio and 49 kW (66 hp) as on the predecessor. The 1698 cc unit was also offered with a twin barrel carburetter and a compression ratio of 9.8:1, offering a maximum power output of 61 kW (83 hp) and much improved torque. Drivers of this [...] "1700 S" [...] engined Rekord had to pay for higher octane fuel, however, and there was also a price to be paid in terms of reduced fuel economy.|$|R
5000|$|The eighth {{generation}} {{model of the}} Passat was introduced in November 2014 in Continental Europe and in January 2015 in the United Kingdom as a four-door saloon and estate. Following other Volkswagen Group passenger vehicles such as the Volkswagen Golf Mk7, {{it is based on}} a stretched variant of the MQB platform, a modular automobile construction platform designed for transverse, front-engined cars. To reduce weight, lightweight materials such as aluminium and vacuum-formed steel have been utilised. According to {{the chairman of the board}} of Volkswagen, Martin Winterkorn, the B8 is [...] " ... a premium car without the premium price", indicating that the Passat nameplate was <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> the compact executive car segment, as opposed to the previous {{generation model}}s that were conceived as large family cars., although some auto journalists have criticised this strategy since it effectively puts the Passat in competition with the Audi A4 - which is expected <b>to</b> <b>move</b> further <b>upmarket</b> for its B9 generation, due for launch in late 2015.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1970s, Lotus sought <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>upmarket</b> {{with the}} launch of the Elite and Eclat models, four seaters aimed at prosperous buyers, with {{features}} such as optional air conditioning and optional automatic transmissions. The mid engined line continued with the Lotus Esprit, which was to prove one of the company's longest lived and most iconic models. Lotus developed its own series of four cylinder DOHC engines, the Lotus 900 series, and later a V8, and turbocharged versions of the engines appeared in the Esprit.|$|E
50|$|By the 1990s, Tan Chong Motor had {{bounced back}} and rationalised their assets and resources. The {{reduction}} in sales {{caused by the}} dominance of the new Proton Saga, which had captured 85% of the market's sub-1.6 litre segment by 1987, a segment which the Datsun/Nissan 120Y had long dominated, had inadvertently steered Tan Chong Motor <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>upmarket</b> and explore export opportunities. Prior to 1994, all Malaysian-assembled Datsun/Nissan cars were sold locally. However, in November 1989, Tan Chong Motor expressed intentions to export their Nissan vehicles to neighbouring ASEAN countries, such as Singapore and Brunei.|$|E
50|$|In the 1880s, {{sewing machine}} {{production}} jumped ahead, with steady {{expansion of the}} plant, and by 1899 {{more than a half}} million machines had been made. The milestone of one million machines was reached in 1911, the same time a fire destroyed much of the plant. The Opel brothers decided to give up sewing machine production, which by this time was much more commodified, and thus commercially unrewarding, than when they had started in the business. Looking <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>upmarket</b> in their manufacturing efforts, they decided to try to produce the more profitable products of bicycles and automobiles.|$|E
25|$|The Thunderbird's fifth {{generation}} {{brought the}} second major change in the car's design direction since its debut in 1955. From 1958 to 1966, the Thunderbird had remained fundamentally the same in concept as a sporty two-door coupe/convertible with two rows of seating. However, {{the introduction of the}} Ford Mustang in early 1964 had created a challenge to the Thunderbird's market positioning for it, like the Thunderbird, was also a two-door coupe/convertible with two rows of seating. Where the Mustang had an advantage was in the point that it was substantially cheaper. To prevent overlap between the two cars, Ford's response was <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the Thunderbird <b>upmarket.</b> The result, introduced for 1967, was a larger Thunderbird with luxury appointments more in line with a Lincoln.|$|R

50|$|The Proton Iriz Car was {{originally}} scheduled for an April, May or June 2014 launch in Malaysia. However, the launch {{has since been}} delayed to 25 September. since {{it has to go}} a 100,000 km drive cycle on road testing. The Iriz will be the first all-new model to be developed under Proton's new owner, DRB-HICOM. Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, recently appointed chairman of Proton has stated that in a bid <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>upmarket,</b> the upcoming Iriz will cost more than expected, but nonetheless still cheaper than its rivals from the same segment. The P2-30A will incorporate better quality components and a long list of standard features never before seen in a small Proton, more even than its bigger siblings, the 2012 Prevé and 2013 Suprima S. Dr. Mahathir has also promised to tackle the issue of quality control among Proton's vendors, with the aim of incorporating the highest quality components from only the best vendors in an effort to improve public confidence in Proton's below-average build quality standards. The Proton Iriz took 4 years to develop at a cost of between RM560 million. The company has also promised a 5-Star ANCAP safety rating for the P2-30A.|$|E
30|$|In summary, {{the central}} basis of frugal {{innovation}} {{is to consider}} emerging markets to be serious markets with potential for sales, as source of resources, and potential points of origin {{for goods and services}} demanded worldwide (Chattopadhyay and Sarkar 2011 p. 44). The products are able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>upmarket</b> to satisfy customers’ needs in developed countries as well (Hang et al. 2010, p. 26). Govindarajan (2012) states that if ‘we can innovate for India we can also simultaneously innovate for the world’ (p. 87). Fukuda and Watanabe (2011) designate the predominant benefit of frugal innovation as enabling a shift of emerging economies from growth driven by consumption into growth driven by investment, which is currently the significant difference between developed and developing economies (p. 91 ff.). As seen above, some EMFs are breaking this new ground yet.|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{success for}} the BMW 326, {{introduced}} in 1936, encouraged a <b>move</b> <b>upmarket.</b> This would involve BMW in challenging the dominance then enjoyed by Mercedes-Benz over a lucrative sector, with their 320 and 340 models.|$|R
50|$|Its styling was {{reflective}} {{of a new}} design direction at Renault, symbolised by the radical Vel Satis and Avantime models, marking a major departure from the previous model, which also saw the range <b>moved</b> <b>upmarket.</b>|$|R

500|$|In 1938, Ziff-Davis, a Chicago-based {{publisher}} {{looking to}} expand into the pulp magazine market, acquired Amazing Stories. [...] The number of science fiction magazines grew quickly; several new titles appeared {{over the next few}} years, including Fantastic Adventures, which was launched by Ziff-Davis in 1939 as a companion to Amazing. [...] Under the editorship of Raymond Palmer the magazines were reasonably successful but published poor quality work, and when Howard Browne took over as editor of Amazing in January 1950 he decided <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the magazine <b>upmarket.</b> [...] Ziff-Davis agreed to back the new magazine, and Browne put together a sample copy, but when the Korean War broke out Ziff-Davis cut their budgets and the project was abandoned. [...] Browne did not give up, and in 1952 received the go-ahead to try a new magazine instead, focused on high-quality fantasy, a genre which had recently become more popular. The first issue of Fantastic, dated Summer 1952, appeared on March 21 of that year.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were few}} styling changes during this time: {{a new one}} piece plastic grill and one piece {{aluminum}} bumpers introduced in 1979. These design changes were also shared with the Cherokee. After {{the introduction of the}} Cherokee, AMC began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the Wagoneer <b>upmarket,</b> and that brought high demand from a new market segment. The [...] "Limited", more luxuriously equipped than the earlier Super Wagoneer, offered Quadra-Trac, power disk brakes, air conditioning, power-adjustable bucket seats, power door locks, power windows, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, leather upholstery, plush carpeting, AM/FM/CB radio, leather-wrapped steering wheel, roof rack, forged aluminum wheels, and [...] "wood grain" [...] trim on the body sides. The two-barrel, 360 CID L AMC V8 engine was standard with a four-barrel, 401 CID L available at extra cost. Even though the US$10,500 suggested retail price was in luxury Cadillac territory, the Limited’s high-level specification attracted buyers and sales were strong with a total of 28,871 Wagoneers produced in 1978, and 27,437 in 1979.|$|R
