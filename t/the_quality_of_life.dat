5|$|At {{the time}} of the line's planning, Downtown Flushing was a quiet Dutch-colonial-style village; what is now Roosevelt Avenue in the area was known as Amity Street, a major {{commercial}} thoroughfare in the neighborhood. In late 1912, Flushing community groups were petitioning the Public Service Commission (PSC) to depress the proposed line in Flushing into a subway tunnel, rather than an elevated line. Unlike a subway, an el would cause disturbances to <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and a loss in nearby property values, as well as a widening of Amity Street that would cause more changes to the already existing town. One Amity Street property owner compared the planned effect of an elevated Flushing Line on Amity Street to the degradation of Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn after the Myrtle Avenue Elevated was built there. On the other hand, a subway would only require that the street be widened, even though it was more expensive than an elevated of the same length.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to define <b>the</b> {{conception}} <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and its components, to prepare a model <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> and to present <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> working <b>life</b> evaluation in an organisation after corrective actions in the work environment. The results of the research into the work-family conflict and the balance of work and personal life study are also presented in the article. This paper follows the analysis of scientific and methodological literature, the methodology of social research and a case study. A model <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> was designed, which includes eight domains <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and their factors. This model was used to study <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> working <b>life</b> in one particular company. <b>The</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> working <b>life</b> could be defined as the synthesis of workplace strategies, processes, and environment, which together stimulate the employee’s job satisfaction. This also depends on working conditions and the organisation’s efficiency. <b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> working <b>life</b> encompasses <b>the</b> following factors: job satisfaction, involvement in performance at work, motivation, efficiency, productivity, health, safety and welfare at work, stress, work load, burnout, etc. The research findings show that <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> working <b>life</b> can be measured, improved, and managed. An organisation has possibilities to increase its employee’s <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and loyalty by improving the working conditions and environment. The high value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> working <b>life</b> directly influences <b>the</b> higher <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> happiness, life satisfaction and subjective well-being are interrelated.

5|$|Deep ecology is a {{movement}} founded by Arne Naess that establishes principles {{for the well-being of}} all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. The movement advocates, among other things, a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will improve <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> rather than the standard of living. Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen. The concept of a billion-year Sustainocene has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species (for example through artificial photosynthesis) allowing Rights of Nature.|$|E
