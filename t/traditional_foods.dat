5|$|By September 1997, Cracker Barrel had 314 restaurants, {{and aimed}} to {{increase}} the number of stores by approximately 50 per year over the following five years. The firm closed its Corner Market operations in 1997 and refocused on its restaurant and gift store locations. Its then president, Ron Magruder, stated that the chain was concentrating on strengthening its core theme, offering <b>traditional</b> <b>foods</b> and retail in a country store setting, with good service and country music. The chain opened its first restaurant and gift store not located near a highway in 1998, in Dothan, Alabama. In the 2000s, in the wake of incidents including charges of racial discrimination and controversy over its policy of firing gay employees, the firm launched a series of promotional activities including a nationwide book drive and a sweepstakes with trips to the Country Music Association Awards and rocking chairs among the prizes.|$|E
40|$|Chronic non-communicable {{diseases}} {{related to}} excessive or unbalanced dietary intakes {{are on the}} rise among some Indigenous populations in Canada. Nutritional problems of Indigenous peoples arise in the transition from a traditional diet to a market diet characterised by highly processed foods with reduced nutrient density. This study used food frequency and 24 -hour recall questionnaires to quantify <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> intake in 18 communities in Denendeh (Western Northwest Territories) and the Yukon. These data allowed comparisons between the two regions (Yukon and Denendeh) and the two seasons of data collection (summer and winter, perceived to be the seasons of highest and lowest <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> intake, respectively). Food choice in general is affected by a multitude of factors determined by individual, societal and environmental influences. In this study, individual, household, and community correlates of <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> intake were assessed in order to construct a multivariate statistical model to describe the correlates of the quantity and diversity of <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> intake in the Western Canadian Arctic. The variables used in this study reflected household demography, market food affordability, access to <b>traditional</b> <b>food,</b> individual characteristics such as age and gender, and perceptions about <b>traditional</b> <b>food.</b> The analysis of the associations between the <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> correlates and <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> intake in terms of quantity and diversity allowed for the description of the profile {{of men and women who}} are high consumers of <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> in both regions.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} investigating the aesthetical and philosophical values of <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> packaging in Yogyakarta, whereas much of traditional values are still applied and existed in the daily life. It is thought that the philosophical value of <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> packaging is related to its use in the traditional ceremonies of the Yogyakarta Palace, such as Garebeg Mulud (Sekaten), Garebeg Syawal, Garebeg Idhul Adha, Tumplak Wajik, and Labuhan.

40|$|In the European Union the {{awareness}} to retain cultural heritage within the different European regions is rising. An {{important element of}} the cultural heritage is the production of <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> products. Few published studies are related to <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> products and even less to innovation in this specific food sector. Taking into consideration the increasing demand for <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> products {{and the importance of}} innovation to gain competitive advantage, there is a great need to carry out research in this field. In the frame of this research a <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> network is understood as the network of <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> firms, research centers and stakeholders of this sector. A <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> firm (TFF) is comprehended as a manufacturer of <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> products, with special attention to small and medium sized TFFs. Hereby, a new definition of <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> products has been developed. This definition states that the key production steps of a <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> product must be performed in a certain area, which can be national, regional or local. The <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> product must have an authentic recipe (mix of ingredients), and/or an authentic origin of raw material, and/or an authentic production process. Furthermore, it must be commercially available for the public in stores or restaurants for at least 50 years and it must be part of the gastronomic heritage, which can be described in a one-page story (Gellynck et al., 2006 a). In the literature, it is emphasized that a network, rather than a single firm determines the potential for innovation (Pittaway et al., 2004; Powell et al., 1996). Innovation involves changes in an organization (Damanpour, 1991). On the one hand, it is a response to changes of the firm's internal or external environment and a preventive step to anticipate changes in the firm's environment on the other. The implementation of organizational innovation contributes to the performance and effectiveness of TFFs and their networks (Damanpour, 1991; Gellynck et al., 2006 c). Therefore, innovation is regarded as an important strategic tool to obtain competitive advantage (Avermaete et al., 2004 a; Gellynck et al., 2006 b). However, not all TFFs develop and implement organizational innovation through their network. Therefore, the aim of the present paper is to construct a conceptual framework for the investigation of barriers and drivers of organizational innovation developed by TFFs in <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> networks.

40|$|<b>Traditional</b> <b>food</b> {{knowledge}} (TFK) {{refers to}} a cultural tradition of sharing food, recipes and cooking skills and techniques and passing down that collective wisdom through generations. The value of this knowledge is hidden in a global food system offering an abundance of commercial convenience foods. This study defines TFK and explores its value to assert space for its recovery and renewal. Using Trevor Hancock’s research on healthy communities and models, such as the Mandala of Health (1985), <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> knowledge will be analyzed for its potential to contribute to individual and community ecosystem health. The role of <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> knowledge is examined with respect to promoting biocultural diversity and improving the capacity for food production among citizens. Food diversity {{is an important component}} of human nutrition and can be an indicator for a bioculturally diverse region. Studies on biocultural diversity recognize the close connection between cultural and biological diversity. Only recently have the losses in cultural heritage, such as <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> knowledge garnered academic and policy attention. <b>Traditional</b> <b>food</b> knowledge can be one means of asserting cultural identity and can be a way to connect people to the natural world. Transmitting this knowledge is one important means of fostering sustainable livelihoods, ecosystem health and enhanced individual and community capacity. <b>Traditional</b> <b>food</b> knowledge can provide an individual with the capacity to prepare meals that are nutritious, safe and culturally relevant. This skill can support adaptation to altered food environments, such as is the case for immigrants and indigenous populations. The food system itself has rapidly changed with global industrialization, urbanization and cultural homogenization; and <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> knowledge is no exception. The distinct expressions of taste and place are facing a continuity gap when <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> knowledge is not passed forward, but rather sidelined as an abstract, historical concept. This study takes a qualitative case study approach exploring the concept of <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> knowledge. The existing literature is compared to the lived experience of immigrants and their families in the Canadian suburban context, specifically in Mississauga, Ontario. This study explores the relevance and value of <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> knowledge to Indonesian-Chinese New Canadians, their families and the wider community. 	Despite the colossal challenges posed by a global food industry, there are personal and community benefits to gaining or relearning <b>traditional</b> <b>food</b> knowledge. The community capacity increases with a greater number of skilled practitioners and educated consumers. Informal sharing of the cultural life skills engages people from various walks of life as they learn about, and from, each other. Governance that enables and sustains this type of community exchange will require changes to ensure equitable support for the opportunity for such informal learning and capacity building to occur among all citizens...|$|R
