40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the <b>terminal</b> <b>gate</b> appointment system at the Los Angeles/Long Beach ports. The appointment system was implemented in 2002 in response to California Assembly Bill (AB) 2650, which seeks to reduce vehicle emissions and highway congestion by reducing truck queuing at marine <b>terminal</b> <b>gates</b> and distributing truck traffic over a greater period of time throughout the day. The legislation permits terminals to adopt either gate appointments or off-peak operating hours as a means of avoiding fines for truck queues. We find no evidence that the appointment system has affected queuing at marine <b>terminal</b> <b>gates.</b> We conclude that responses to AB 2650 are largely explained by institutional and contractual relationships that drive port operating practices.

40|$|A fast <b>gate</b> <b>module</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} at KEKB, which {{can pick up a}} signal of one bunch along a bunch train. The <b>gate</b> <b>module</b> was attached to a tune measurement system and to a turn-by-turn beam-position monitor system. Continuous monitoring of the betatron tune is an indispensable tool to keep the machine in a stable condition. A measurement of the tune along a bunch train is helpful to estimate the photoelectron cloud density in the Low-Energy Ring (LER). A large tune shift was observed in the High-Energy Ring (HER). The bunch phase is shifted along a train, which can be explained using a periodic transient beam-loading effect. ...|$|R

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of continuing growth of container volume {{and the introduction of}} 12 [*] 000 TEU plus containerships into major trade routes, the port industry is under pressure {{to come up with the}} necessary capacity to accommodate the increasing freight volume. One critical issue is the marine <b>terminal</b> <b>gate</b> capacity. Limited gate capacity leads to congestion. The harbor trucking industry operates in a very competitive environment; gate congestion is detrimental to their economic well-being. This article applies a multi-server queuing model to analyze marine <b>terminal</b> <b>gate</b> congestion and quantify truck waiting cost. An optimization model is developed to balance the gate operating cost and trucker’s cost associated with excessive waiting time. The model is tested using data from field observations. A case study is applied to analyze gate congestion behavior and truck waiting cost. Model sensitivity is discussed. The results indicate that truck waiting cost at marine <b>terminal</b> <b>gates</b> is an issue that needs to be addressed. A truck appointment system seems to be the most viable way to reduce gate congestion and increase system efficiency. With an optimized appointment system, the total system costs, especially truck waiting cost, can be drastically reduced. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to succinctly identify the critical {{problems inherent in}} deep submicron (DSM) designs. The conventional wisdom {{has been that the}} real problem in DSM design is the migration of delay to interconnect and the real solution is to integrate logic optimization and physical design together. We counter that DSM effects can largely be avoided in blocks of 50 - 100 K <b>gate</b> <b>modules</b> and that the real problem in DSM design is a new physical design problem: to assemble hundreds to thousands of 50 K <b>gate</b> <b>modules</b> in the presence of timing, power, and reliability constraints. 2. Earlier Problem Definitions A wide variety of independent sources have forecast that interconnect effects will dominate in deep submicron (DSM) designs. This viewpoint is epitomized in Figure 1 from the NTRS [1] where it is predicted that interconnect delay dominates gate delay beyond 0. 25 m. Further compounding the problem is the presence of noise effects, which can significantly increase the delay of a signal [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Context. Due to {{increase}} in demand for RORO shipping services,the RORO <b>terminal</b> <b>gate</b> system need to handle more number of vehicles for every RORO vessel departure. Therefore, various congestion problems can occur; so, to address all possible congestion related problemsat RORO <b>terminal,</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>gate</b> systems are implemented with advanced technologies and updated to full or partial functioning automated gate systems. Objectives. In this research study considering the future increase in demand for wheeled cargo shipping, we attempt to propose a solution for reducing congestion and investigating optimal positions for each automated gate system service at RORO port terminal. Methods. In this Master thesis, as part of qualitative study we conduct a literature review and case study {{to know about the}} existing related work on this research problem and know about the real world system operation and behaviour of a RORO <b>terminal</b> <b>gate</b> system. Later, applying the adequate knowledge acquired from above mentioned qualitative studies, we perform a discrete event simulation experiment using Anylogic® professional 7. 02 simulation software to address defined research objectives. Results. Considering the peak and low periods of present and future estimated demand volumes as different scenarios,various simulation experiment results are generated for different key performance indicators. The result values of these key performance indicators address various research objectives. Conclusions. This research study finally concludes that, the average queue length values at each automated gate system service implicates optimal position for each service and directly address the congestion problem. We also conclude that in every estimated increase in vehicles attending the RORO terminal, assigning optimal arrival time windows for respective vehicle types minimizes the congestion problem at automated gate system...|$|R
