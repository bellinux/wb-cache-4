5|$|As {{with prior}} drafts, <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> worst overall record from the {{previous}} season selected first, with teams from the AL and NL alternating picks. If two or more teams had the same record, <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> worse record from two seasons prior would draft higher. Because the Pittsburgh Pirates of the NL selected first overall in 1986 Major League Baseball Draft, an AL team had the first pick in the 1987 draft. The final two selections {{in the first round}} both came from American League teams, as the AL had two more organizations than the NL.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there was}} a {{classification}} for teams. After each stage, the times {{of the first three}} riders on each team were added together. <b>The</b> <b>team</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lowest cumulative time was the leader of the team classification.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{creation}} of the NPB's two-league system, the regular-season winner of the CL had always advanced to the Japan Series, where it competed against the PL champion. The PL used the same system until 1973, when the league created NPB's only postseason play prior to 2004 (other than the Japan Series). This system matched <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> best first-half record against <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> best second-half record. The winner of this best-of-five series advanced to the Japan Series, where they played against the CL champion. This system proved problematic when the Hankyu Braves won both the first and second halves of the 1976 and 1978 seasons, making a playoff series unnecessary. The system was eliminated after the 1982 season. Instead, the PL announced the following season that the first- and second-place teams would compete in a best-of-five playoff series after the 130-game regular season if five or fewer games separated the two teams. Unpopular with most baseball media and fans, the idea was scrapped after three seasons with a series never needing to be played. The two leagues returned to sending <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> best regular season record in their respective league to compete against each other in the championship series.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> South Conference, <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{best and}} worst records, and the second- and third-best records, played {{each other in the}} South Conference Semi-Finals.

5000|$|To {{accommodate}} the new conference and division structure, the USARL {{created a new}} playoff structure for 2014. In the South Conference, all four teams automatically qualified for the South Conference Playoffs. <b>The</b> <b>teams</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> best and worst records played each other, as did <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> second- and third-best records.

5|$|The final {{classification}} {{was a team}} classification. The team's time on {{each was}} calculated by taking the best three riders from that team and adding their times together; <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lowest cumulative time {{was the leader of}} the classification.|$|E
5|$|The playoff {{structure}} {{used from}} 1933 to 1966 was considered inequitable by some {{because of the}} number of times it failed to match the teams with the two best records in the championship game, as only the conference winners would qualify for playoff contention. Four times between 1950 and 1966 (in 1951, 1956, 1960, and 1963) <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> second-best win-loss record did not qualify for the playoffs while <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> best record in the other conference, but only the third-best in the league, would advance to the championship game.|$|E

5|$|Although no jersey was awarded, {{there was}} also a {{classification}} for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.

The last team to win both the Presidents' Trophy and the Stanley Cup in the same season was the 2012–13 Chicago Blackhawks.
