60|$|Wondering why Grahame had {{not brought}} the vessel head to wind, she moved aft cautiously, {{clinging}} to the rail, until {{she saw that the}} awning had broken loose from its lashings. Part of it thrashed about the deck, making a furious noise, but the rest, blown forward, had fouled the foresail boom, and was stretched tight, but distended like a half-filled balloon. Acting as a sail, it prevented the steamer from answering her helm. One or two very indistinct figures struggled with the canvas, but they seemed unable to master it, and Evelyn crept on until she could look through the skylight into the engine-room. It was here the real battle must be fought, for the cylinders that strained under <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> were the vitals of the ship. She could see them shake, as if about to burst their fastening bolts and leap from the columns, as the big cross-heads banged up and down.|$|E
60|$|Tom King {{had never}} been a talker, and he sat by the window, morosely silent, staring at his hands. The veins stood out {{on the backs of the}} hands, large and swollen; and the knuckles, smashed and {{battered}} and malformed, testified to the use to which they had been put. He had never heard that a man's life was the life of his arteries, but well he knew the meaning of those big upstanding veins. His heart had pumped too much blood through them at <b>top</b> <b>pressure.</b> They no longer did the work. He had stretched the elasticity out of them, and with their distension had passed his endurance. He tired easily now. No longer could he do a fast twenty rounds, hammer and tongs, fight, fight, fight, from gong to gong, with fierce rally on top of fierce rally, beaten to the ropes and in turn beating his opponent to the ropes, and rallying fiercest and fastest of all in that last, twentieth round, with the house on its feet and yelling, himself rushing, striking, ducking, raining showers of blows upon showers of blows and receiving showers of blows in return, and all the time the heart faithfully pumping the surging blood through the adequate veins. The veins, swollen at the time, had always shrunk down again, though each time, imperceptibly at first, not quite--remaining just a trifle larger than before. He stared at them and at his battered knuckles, and, for the moment, caught a vision of the youthful excellence of those hands before the first knuckle had been smashed on the head of Benny Jones, otherwise known as the Welsh Terror.|$|E

5000|$|Connor Wilson {{also began}} a {{successful}} airflow measuring instrumentation group within the company, creating successful and highly accurate 100mm rotating vane electronic anemometers. The earliest rotating vane anemometers, {{such as the}} EDRA4, was constructed in hardwood cases.

During the late 1980s, the company introduced digital readout versions of their popular 100mm rotating vane products with the portable DVA30 and DVA30VT, as well as smaller, lower cost, patented, hand-held rotating vane anemometers (model LCA6000). The company was also highly respected for its high accuracy bench <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> manometer (MEDM500 and MEDM5K). The company also pursued and created the first high accuracy hand held ultrasonic anemometer during the mid 1990s.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{predictive}} models the multilayer perceptron and random forest are evaluated to predict cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressure.</b> The dataset {{used in this}} thesis contains brightness temperatures, reflectances and other useful variables to determine the cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument on the two satellites NOAA- 17 and NOAA- 18 during the time period 2006 - 2009. The dataset also contains numerical weather prediction (NWP) variables calculated using mathematical models. In the dataset there are also observed cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> and cloud top height estimates from the more accurate instrument on the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite. The predicted cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> is converted into an interpolated cloud top height. The predicted pressure and interpolated height are then evaluated against the more accurate and observed cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> and cloud top height from the instrument on the satellite CALIPSO. The predictive models have been performed on the data using different sampling strategies {{to take into account}} the performance of individual cloud classes prevalent in the data. The multilayer perceptron is performed using both the original response cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> and a log transformed repsonse to avoid negative values as output which is prevalent when using the original response.

40|$|The bi-spectral {{threshold}} (BTH) for {{cloud detection}} and height assignment is now operational at NASA's Global Hydrology and Climate Center (GHCC). This new approach {{is similar in}} principle to the bi-spectral spatial coherence (BSC) method with improvements made to produce a more robust cloud-filtering algorithm for nighttime cloud detection and subsequent 24 -hour operational cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> assignment. The method capitalizes on cloud and surface emissivity differences from the GOES 3. 9 and 10. 7 -micrometer channels to distinguish cloudy from clear pixels. Separate threshold values are determined for day and nighttime detection, and applied to a 20 -day minimum composite difference image to better filter background effects and enhance differences in cloud properties. A cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> is assigned to each cloudy pixel by referencing the 10. 7 -micrometer channel temperature to a thermodynamic profile from a locally -run regional forecast model. This paper and supplemental poster will present an objective validation of nighttime cloud detection by the BTH approach in comparison with previous methods.
