50|$|The Equestrian Monument to Victor Emmanuel II was {{designed}} by Salvino Salvini, who completed a stucco model in 1864. The initial plan, to fuse the statue in a single piece, was deemed to costly for the city, then engaged <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> Florence <b>into</b> <b>capital</b> of Italy. When the capital was moved soon after to Rome, the project was again shelved. Plans regained impetus in 1892 with local fundraising, and two statues were installed on April 27, 1898; these, however, were not of kings. Ubaldini Peruzzi, first mayor of Florence and erstwhile minister of the kingdom, replaced the tarnished and overthrown Napoleon III. The King Victor Emanuel II statue {{was replaced by the}} Monument to Bettino Ricasoli (former prime minister) by Augusto Rivalta. An equestrian statue of Victor Emanuel II was erected in 1890 in Piazza Vittorio Veneto.|$|R
30|$|This decisive surge towards self-organised {{forms and}} economies {{may also be}} {{associated}} with the “heroic entrepreneurial spirit” proposed by de Soto (2000). According to this author, there are entrepreneurs in Third World Countries who have talent, enthusiasm and the ability to make profit from “nothing”. The obstacle that prevents them from creating capital is linked solely with the absence of a system of recognition of property and the consequent impossibility <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> it <b>into</b> <b>capital.</b> The process of “formalisation” of informal properties may favour the creation of new institutions and constitute an open system of properties easily accessible to everyone. De Soto interprets the informal economy as a rebellion from the bottom that will oppose the traditional capitalist system. In the same direction, Davis (2006) defines a future perspective based on a conflict for survival, a struggle between formal and informal that will actually start to develop in the slums.|$|R
30|$|From the {{perspective}} of evaluating company performance, the performance of listed companies in the Chinese energy industry has three dimensions: CPP, CGP and COP. Obviously, the result {{is different from that}} which would apply using mainstream evaluating dimensions such as solvency, turnover ability, profitability, growth ability, and cash-flow ability. This is a very interesting finding. Profit performance measured profit efficiency, which encompassed the amount and percentage of company profit. Growth performance measured the development potential formed by the continuous expansion of the business. Operating performance measured the control efficiency, which indicates the ability to use capital for repaying debt, the turnover, and the ability <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>capital</b> <b>into</b> cash. Hence, evaluating company performance with the dimensions of profit, growth, and operations not only highlights the uniqueness of the energy industry but also provides practical guidance.|$|R
30|$|Investing {{in social}} {{relationships}} {{is a way}} of building up social resources, which represent a powerful instrument – along with financial resources – <b>to</b> be <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> human <b>capital</b> (Coleman, 1988). Yet families may draw potential resources from outside the network: in this sense, social capital is a multiplier of an individual’s own (cultural) capital (Bourdieu, 1980). Bourdieu, as well as Lareau (2002), defines cultural capital as symbolic knowledge useful in understanding how the social world works that can be passed on within families. Social capital, by contrast, refers to the ability of families to manage successfully the material and symbolic resources that they possess for the benefit of their members. Bourdieu stresses the importance of the cultural capital necessary to activate social capital, thus suggesting that how the social networks are used may be as valuable (or even more so) than social networks themselves (Furstenberg & Kaplan, 2003). Those two conceptualisations emphasise different yet compatible dimensions of social capital: the first stresses the form of social capital, whilst the second highlights the process through which social capital affects children’s behaviours (Mcneal, 1999).|$|R
30|$|We {{observe the}} {{emergent}} sense-making that creates boundaries between workers of different origins, drawing on ethnographic data gathered over an eleven week period by Wu, who worked alongside {{urban and rural}} service employees at a retail store in Beijing. We show that boundaries between workers are reproduced and elaborated through three mechanisms: (1) administratively determined division of jobs, (2) extra-organizational collective identities that workers draw on to valorize their labor, and (3) third party (customer) preferences. Throughout their workplace struggles, workers draw upon a discourse promulgated by the state that promotes individual “quality”. They implicitly and explicitly refer to this suzhi discourse in order <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> cultural <b>capital</b> <b>into</b> workplace “service” <b>capital.</b> Thus, the state acts as kind of symbolic broker in these struggles, while customers are real brokers, expressing preferences for urban workers and against rural workers. The formation of service floor boundaries is also conditioned by macro structural dynamics that exclude migrant workers from urban citizenship. The focus on boundaries illuminates a problematic mode of worker agency, as workers mobilize resources {{against each other in}} their contention for status and dignity in the workplace (Hodson 2001).|$|R
40|$|Australian home {{owners and}} investors benefit from various tax {{concessions}}. Home owner tax concessions are poorly targeted with older, higher income households the main beneficiaries. There {{could also be}} efficiency consequences if the tax favoured owner-occupied housing sector attracts investment that {{would otherwise have been}} employed more productively elsewhere. Investors can use negative gearing <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> ordinary income <b>into</b> <b>capital</b> gains that are taxed leniently. These tax benefits distort the supply of rental housing to the detriment of affordable rental housing opportunities. To address some of these concerns, the paper examines a potential tax reform package that would replace stamp duty by a uniform flat rate land tax. Using Victorian Valuer-General property data, we estimate the land tax liabilities that property owners would be asked to pay if a revenue neutral broad-based land tax replaced stamp duty on conveyance. We describe these land tax burdens if hypothetically levied in Melbourne as of 2005 - 2006, and compare the new tax burdens with liabilities under existing stamp duty provisions. The strong efficiency case in favour of such a tax substitution is complemented by empirical findings which suggest that higher income communities shoulder higher land tax burdens...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between different forms of cultural taste and the density of social contacts across alternative types of network relations classified by average tie strength. The author builds on Bourdieu’s ([1986] 2001) classic statement on the “forms of capital ” (economic, social, and cultural) and the conversion dynamics among them, and on DiMaggio’s (1987) connection between cultural tastes and sociability. He hypothesizes that (1) in addition to cultural tastes being determined by network relations, cultural tastes are used to form and sustain those networks. Furthermore he expects that (2) highbrow culture taste will be less likely <b>to</b> be <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> social <b>capital</b> beyond immediate strong-tie circles due to its more restricted, “assetspecific” nature. Because of its generalized appeal, taste for popular culture {{will be more likely}} to be associated with weak-tie network density. The results broadly support these hypotheses: a model that specifies an effect of culture on network density provides a better fit to the data than the traditional conception of networks as determining taste. In addition using log-linear models and instrumental-variable methods, I show that popular culture consumption has a positive impact on weak-tie network density but not strong-tie network density, while highbrow culture consumption selectively increases strong-tie density but has no appreciable effect on weak ties, net of standard socioeconomic variables. These finding...|$|R
40|$|An {{international}} {{payment for}} ecosystem service (IPES) schemes {{may be one}} of the only mechanisms available to stimulate the provision of vital non-marketed ecosystem services at the global level, as those nations that benefit from global ecosystem services (GES) cannot readily force other sovereign nations to provide them. Currently, international trade offers trillions of dollars in incentives for countries <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> natural <b>capital</b> <b>into</b> marketable goods and services, and few payments to entice countries to conserve natural capital in order to sustain critical non-marketed ecosystem services. We examine the biophysical characteristics of climate change and biodiversity to understand the obstacles to developing effective IPES schemes. We find that none of the existing schemes for providing GES are adequate, given the scale of the problem. A cap and auction scheme for CO 2 emissions among wealthy nations could fund IPES and simultaneously deter carbon emissions. To disburse funds, we should adapt Brazil's ICMS ecológico, and apportion available funds to targeted countries in proportion to how well they meet specific criteria designed to measure the provision of GES. Individual countries can then develop their own policies for increasing provision of these services, ensured of compensation if they do so. Indirect IPES should include funding for freely available technologies that protect or provide GES, such as the low carbon energy alternatives that will be essential for curbing climate change. Markets rely on the price mechanism to generate profits, which rations technology to those who can afford it, reducing adoption rates, innovation and total value.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to bring {{theoretical and empirical}} research on capital gains realization behavior closer together by considering whether investors who appear to engage more in strategic tax avoidance activity also respond differently to tax rates. We find that such investors exhibit significantly smaller responses to permanent tax rate changes than other investors. Put another way, a larger part of their response to capital gains tax rates reflects timing, consistent with their closer adherence to tax avoidance strategies emphasizing arbitrage based on tax rate differentials. This finding holds for two alternative specifications of realization behavior, one of which suggests larger permanent responses to capital gains tax rates than those of previous panel studies.

30|$|Marx {{discussed}} the labor {{process and the}} process of producing the surplus value altogether (Marx, 1867, p. 197). According to him, the absolute surplus value and the relative surplus value are generated from labor, and they are <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> <b>capital.</b> Thus, the general law of capitalist accumulation originated from the accumulation of surplus value, and it is called primitive accumulation (Marx 1978 b, p. 784). Based on the logic of Mark, it tends to decrease the surplus value (Marx, Simpson, & Ryazanskaya, 1963). However, the tendency of decreasing interest in a capitalistic society was noticeable in Western society after the Industrial Revolution in the 19 th century {{as well as in the}} US after the mid- 20 th century (Medio, 1972; Wolff, 1979). Marx predicted that capitalism essentially reduces the ratio of surplus value, resulting in the panic of the capitalistic society. The surplus value generated from labor is fundamentally <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> <b>capital,</b> and the accumulation of capital reduces the value. Lastly, there has been a financial panic in capitalist society.|$|R
