5|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} {{is commonly}} contrasted against phyletic gradualism, {{the idea that}} evolution generally occurs uniformly and by <b>the</b> <b>steady</b> and gradual transformation of whole lineages (called anagenesis).

40|$|Three control {{methods for}} <b>the</b> {{workpiece}} <b>steady</b> based traverse grinding process are examined {{and a new}} approach, termed <b>the</b> dynamic workpiece <b>steady</b> control method, is proposed for improved grinding efficiency and accuracy. This method requires that the motion profiles of <b>the</b> <b>steadies</b> vary dependent upon the wheel position. Mathematical models for a steady based traverse grinding system are presented together with an iterative algorithm for {{the determination of the}} position profiles of <b>the</b> workpiece <b>steadies.</b> A case study of the grinding process is considered to demonstrate the proposed control method and it is shown that a reduction in grinding error and a higher grinding efficiency involves an increase in the force applied by <b>the</b> <b>steadies,</b> which can affect workpiece surface quality. Accordingly a compromise between these parameters has to be made. © 1993...|$|R

5|$|In the Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck {{proposed}} that species could acquire new characteristics from influences in their environment, in two rules that he named as laws.

His second law held that any changes made in this way would be inherited. Together, Lamarck's laws imply <b>the</b> <b>steady</b> adaptation of animals to their environments.|$|E

5|$|Sir Charles Lyell (1797–1875) {{was also}} from Angus and his Principles of Geology built on Hutton's ideas.

Penguins, including Adélie and chinstrap penguins, visit the island infrequently.

5|$|Although breed {{associations}} and the French National Stud are making {{efforts to protect}} the breed, very low numbers persist, and these organizations consider the breed very close to extinction. It {{is one of the}} most threatened French horse breeds. The production of horse meat has declined due to a decrease in consumption, and most male foals are neither selected for reproduction nor work. One author says that more alternatives to slaughter are needed and that <b>the</b> <b>steady</b> decline in breed numbers is proof that the breed is slowly disappearing. Beginning in 2011, the Trait du Nord association is working with the North Pas-de-Calais regional council and other groups to increase the number of births by 20 percent by December 2014, and double the number by 2020.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} game Georgia Tech {{defeated}} Furman 25–0, playing mainly substitutes. Hay was spread on the field {{in an attempt to}} counteract <b>the</b> <b>steady</b> downpour. Tech quarterback Al Hill scored two touchdowns, and Dan Whelchel (called Walthall) scored a third when he recovered a fumble by Theodore Shaver after crossing the goal line. Although Furman's lineup included future South Carolina Hall-of-Famer Speedy Speer, there was little Speer could do to affect the outcome. Tech's starting lineup was Ulrich (left end), Higgins (left tackle), Whelchel (left guard), Johnson (center), Wright (right guard), Doyle (right tackle), Colcord (right end), Hill (quarterback), Smith (left halfback), Shaver (right halfback), and Harlan (fullback).|$|E

It {{marked the first}} season since 2001 in which no hurricanes made landfall in the United States, {{and was the first}} since 1994 in which no tropical cyclones formed during October. Following the intense activity of 2005, forecasters predicted that the 2006 season would be only slightly less active. Instead activity was slowed by a rapidly forming moderate El Niño event, the presence of the Saharan Air Layer over the tropical Atlantic, and <b>the</b> <b>steady</b> presence of a robust secondary high-pressure area to the Azores high centered on Bermuda. There were no tropical cyclones after October 2.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound effects}} were {{designed}} by Star Wars veteran Ben Burtt. Whereas the phaser blast noises from the television series were derived from The War of the Worlds (1953), Burtt made his phaser sounds more like his blasters from Star Wars, because Abrams' depiction of phasers were closer to the blasters' bullet-like fire, rather than <b>the</b> <b>steady</b> beams of energy in previous Star Trek films. Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: he tapped a long spring against a contact microphone, and combined that with cannon fire. Burtt used a 1960s oscillator to create a musical and emotional hum to the warping and transporting sounds.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>steady</b> {{increase}} in traffic encouraged the trustees {{to press on}} with improvements. Witton Brook was widened in 1788, and the lock was raised, but subsidence caused by the salt mining resulted in a new lock being needed in 1826. A longer-term solution {{was provided by the}} decision to move Northwich lock to a new site below the town. When the work was finished in 1829, Witton Brook lock was no longer necessary, and was removed. New cuts and locks were built through the 1790s at Vale Royal, Newbridge, Hartford and Hunts, and Butty Meadow lock was removed. In response to petitions, the construction of a towing path suitable for horses was started in 1792, and was completed as far as Anderton by mid-1793. It was later extended to Winsford, and bow-hauling of boats by men was ended.|$|E
