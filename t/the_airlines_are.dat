50|$|Regional airliners {{are also}} being blamed for flight delays in the US. According to the Wall Street Journal, 30% of flights in June 2007 were late {{by an average of}} 62 minutes. The delays are being blamed on an {{increased}} number of smaller aircraft, which <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> <b>are</b> using in order to fill out schedules and provide more flights per day. This has led to the grounding of 385 larger aircraft and the adding of 1,029 regionals over the period from 2000 to 2006. The downside to this approach is that airports are running out of gates, causing delays as aircraft queue up for this limited resource.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, integer {{programming}} models {{are applied to}} combinatorial problems in air traffic flow management. For the two problems studied, models are developed and analyzed both theoretically and computationally. This dissertation makes contributions to {{integer programming}} while providing efficient tools for solving air traffic flow management problems. Currently, a constrained arrival capacity situation at an airport in the United States is alleviated by holding inbound aircraft at their departure gates. The ground holding problem (GH) decides which aircraft to hold {{on the ground and}} for how long. This dissertation examines the GH from two perspectives. First, the hubbing operations of <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> <b>are</b> considered by adding side constraints to GH. These constraints enforce the desire of the airlines to temporally groupbanks of flights. Five basic models and several variations of the ground holding problem with banking constraints (GHB) are presented. A particularly strong, facet-inducing model of the banking constraints is presented which allows one t...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{three different}} problems belonging to different planning {{stages of the}} workforce scheduling process. The first article addresses a tour scheduling problem faced by a ground-handling agency at airports. In this problem, multiskilled agents are assigned to shifts and days-off within a planning horizon of one month to cover the airlines agent requirements. The second article considers a technician routing and scheduling problem form an external maintenance provider. This problem mainly involves obtaining weekly schedules such that the maintenance tasks requested by geographically distributed customers are fulfilled. The considered decisions consist of the assignment of technicians to teams, the assignment teams to tasks, and the dispatch of teams to service routes. The third article addresses a task scheduling problem for check-in counters personnel at airports. This problem involves the daily assignment of multiskilled agents to flights (check-ins and boardings) considering the change-over times between gates, such that the agent requirements from <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> <b>are</b> satisfied...|$|E
