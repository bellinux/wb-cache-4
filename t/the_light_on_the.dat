5|$|In {{homodyne}} detection, {{the interference}} occurs between two beams {{at the same}} wavelength (or carrier frequency). The phase {{difference between the two}} beams results in a change in the intensity of <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> detector. The resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured, or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded. Most of the interferometers discussed in this article fall into this category.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} lighthouse, {{known as}} the Round Tower, was built after the local vicar, either John Goulden in 1764 or Walter Harris in 1799, raised a subscription amongst the local population to replace <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of St Andrews Church tower. The four-storey Round Tower was built next to the church. It was taken over and improved by Trinity House in 1815, and operated until 1832, following which the top two storeys were removed.|$|E

5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E

25|$|The Bell System {{dial service}} {{implemented}} a feature called automatic number identification (ANI) which facilitated services like automated billing, toll-free 800-numbers, and 9-1-1 service. In manual service, the operator knows where a call is originating by <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> switchboard jack field. Before ANI, long distance calls were placed into an operator queue and the operator asked the calling party's number and recorded it {{on a paper}} toll ticket.|$|E
25|$|On 14 May 1810 Captain Edward Sneyd Clay assumed command. On 26 October 1810 he {{captured}} the 2-gun Danish privateer Norwegian Girl.

Captain Clay and his officers were cleared of blame at the subsequent court martial with the exception of Mr G. Scott, the master, and C. Gascoigne, the pilot, who were judged to have mistaken fires from a lime kiln on shore for <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Isle of May.|$|E
25|$|Focusing {{the light}} beam {{to a point}} {{on the surface of}} the sample under test, and {{recombining}} the reflected light with the reference will yield an interferogram with sample information corresponding to a single A-scan (Z axis only). Scanning of the sample can be accomplished by either scanning <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sample, or by moving the sample under test. A linear scan will yield a two-dimensional data set corresponding to a cross-sectional image (X-Z axes scan), whereas an area scan achieves a three-dimensional data set corresponding to a volumetric image (X-Y-Z axes scan), also called full-field OCT.|$|E

25|$|The lens is a {{transparent}} convex or 'lens' shaped {{body with a}} harder outer layer and a softer inner layer. It focuses <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> retina. The shape of the lens can be altered by ciliary muscles which are directly attached to lens capsule {{by means of the}} zonular fibres. In addition to these muscles, some birds also have a second set, Crampton’s muscles, that can change the shape of the cornea, thus giving birds a greater range of accommodation than is possible for mammals. This accommodation can be rapid in some diving water birds such as in the mergansers. The iris is a coloured muscularly operated diaphragm in front of the lens which controls the amount of light entering the eye. At the centre of the iris is the pupil, the variable circular area through which the light passes into the eye.|$|E
500|$|The {{position}} of the town {{on the edge of}} the Somerset Levels [...] and moors where they meet the Bristol Channel, has resulted in a history dominated by land reclamation and sea defences since Roman times. Burnham was seriously affected by the Bristol Channel floods of 1607, with the present curved concrete wall being completed in 1988. There have been many shipwrecks on the Gore Sands, which lie just offshore and can be exposed at low tides. Lighthouses are hence prominent landmarks in the town, with the original lighthouse known as the Round Tower built to replace <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of the 14th century tower of St Andrews Church. The [...] pillar or High Lighthouse and the low wooden pile lighthouse or Lighthouse on legs on the beach were built to replace it. The town's first lifeboat was provided in 1836 by the Corporation of Bridgwater.|$|E

[...] The English magistrate and social reformer John Fielding, who was blind, is pictured entering from the left saying [...] "I should be glad to see this spirit", while his companion says [...] "Your W——r's had better get your Warrant back'd by his L—rds—p", referring to a Middlesex magistrate's warrant which required an endorsement from the Lord Mayor, Samuel Fludyer.
