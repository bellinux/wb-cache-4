40|$|This {{graduation}} thesis describes ISO {{standards that}} are in use in surveying engineering for establishment of primary and secondary systems and for determining permitted deviations of points of these systems. Thesis describes some examples of geodetic measuring points and measuring targets. The right way of setting up of these points is a basis for quality measurements. Thesis describes control measurements and permitted deviations to verify geometric characteristics on building sites. Thesis also gives requirements of invar levelling staffs that are in use in geodesy for precise measurements of heights and requirements of <b>telescopic</b> tripods and <b>connections</b> between tripod and measuring instrument. Graduation thesis also describes field procedures for testing surveying instruments. With these tests we can determine the best achievable measure of precision of a particular instrument under field conditions...|$|R
