In 2007, the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy collaborated with the Equus Survival Trust to collect DNA samples and photo-document the largest herd in South Carolina, considered to be the largest remaining herd, with a heritage tracing back to the American Civil War. DNA testing was undertaken in an effort to identify horses for a new studbook, reveal what DNA markers the breed carries, and map the breed's genetic place among all other horse breeds worldwide. Sixty horses were tested in the effort.|$|E

The variety of pathological events presents opportunities to find treatments that interfere with the damage processes. Neuroprotection methods to decrease secondary injury, {{have been the subject}} of interest follows TBI. However, trials to test agents that could halt these cellular mechanisms have met largely with failure. For example, interest existed in cooling the injured brain; however, a 2014 Cochrane review did not find enough evidence <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> useful or not. A 2016 review found that maintaining a normal or low normal temperature appeared useful in adults but not children. High quality evidence to support targeted temperature management below normal however is poor.|$|E

In 2007, the organization partnered with the Equus Survival Trust in a project to preserve the breed that included DNA sampling, {{the creation of a new}} studbook and mapping the genetics of the breed. The Conservancy participated in the rescue of the Wilbur Cruce strain of Colonial Spanish horse when the area in which it lived was to be turned over to a land conservation program that required domestic animals to be removed. After the rescue, a conservation plan was developed for the animals and small breeding groups of horses were placed with responsible parties. It also assisted in formulating a conservation and breeding strategy for a strain of Colonial Spanish horses from Santa Cruz Island in California. This support helped the horses to become recognized and registrable with the Colonial Spanish registry.|$|E

25|$|In {{the effort}} to develop an {{aviation}} biofuel, Air New Zealand and Boeing researched the jatropha plant <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a viable green alternative to conventional fuel. A two-hour test flight, using a 50-50 mixture of the new biofuel with Jet A-1 feeding a Rolls Royce RB-211 engine {{of one of the}} airline's 747-400s, was completed on 30 December 2008. The engine was then removed to be scrutinised and studied to identify any differences between the jatropha blend and regular Jet A1. No effects to performances were found. The use of jatropha has been identified as a possible future fuel but large tracts of low quality land needed to grow the plant would have to be found without impeding other agricultural uses.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Smith {{would put}} the seer stone into a hat, and put {{his face in the}} hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the {{darkness}} the spiritual light would shine. A piece of something resembling parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing. One character at a time would appear, and under it was the interpretation in English. Brother Joseph would read off the English to Oliver Cowdery, who was his principal scribe, and when it was written down and repeated to Brother Joseph <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> correct, then it would disappear, and another character with the interpretation would appear. Thus the Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God, and not by any power of man.|$|E

The idea for character faces beneath the cards remained from previous theme iterations, and the character voices were provided by indie game developers. Of the development process, Wohlwend called it [...] "tough and frustrating and sometimes hard <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> worth it".

500|$|British record {{producer}} Ken Nelson and {{the band}} produced [...] "Trouble" [...] for their debut album, Parachutes. The track was recorded four times before the band got the take they preferred. The backing track was first recorded, and each time they add <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> working. They, however, decided that the first three versions were not [...] "working". The last take was recorded into Pro Tools with a shaker to provide the rhythm to the track. For the backing track, Will Champion played the drums and Martin on the piano which they recorded in a little wooden room. After Guy Berryman's bass was recorded, guitarist Jonny Buckland added the guitar section. In recording the piano section of the track, the band used two microphones—one was brighter-sounding and the other had a fuller sound. Nelson, who {{wanted to keep the}} song simple, chose the fuller sound microphone for the mixing.|$|E

500|$|When Elizabeth I became queen, {{she ordered}} {{a survey of}} her castles. A 1562 report told her that only ten castles {{in the north of}} her realm were worth keeping; Melbourne was not one of these. A further survey in 1576 {{reported}} that, although the stonework was in good condition apart from one chimney and window, the timbers were perished, the lead roof was full of holes, one kitchen {{was on the verge of}} collapse, and another needed its floor replacing. In the same year, George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, wrote to the queen to assure her that the castle was in good condition, worth £1,000, and could be repaired for £100. Since he was responsible for keeping the imprisoned Mary, Queen of Scots, and her 140 retainers, he hoped to get her moved to Melbourne. In 1583, the castle was inspected again <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> suitable to house the captive queen. Although the rooms were sufficient in number and quality, the unfinished building was deemed [...] "imperfect at every corner". The large rooms would need subdividing, the floors were earth and plaster, and there was no paved courtyard [...] "so as being out of dors you are in the myre, for it is verie foule and unpleasaunt to walk round about the said house". In 1584, Queen Elizabeth finally decided to move Mary to Melbourne, only for the plan to be abandoned following the Babington Plot to assassinate the English queen and place her Scottish cousin on the throne.|$|E

So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant.

2500|$|Two {{weeks before}} the film's premiere, the Daily Telegraph erroneously {{reported}} that Luhrmann gave in to studio pressure after [...] "intense" [...] talks with executives and re-wrote and then re-shot the ending of Australia for a happier conclusion after [...] "disastrous reviews" [...] from test screenings. To counter these negative reports, the studio had Jackman and Kidman promoting Australia on The Oprah Winfrey Show, which dedicated an entire episode of the program to the film, and Fox Co-Chairman Tom Rothman spoke to the Los Angeles Times where he described the Telegraph article as [...] "patently nonsensical. It's all too typical {{of the way the}} world works today that everybody picked up an unsourced, anonymous quote-filled story in a tabloid from Sydney and nobody ever bothered to check <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> accurate". Rothman also said that Luhrmann had final cut on his film. The director admitted that he wrote six endings in the drafts he authored, and shot three of them.|$|E

2500|$|Arthur Tsang Hin Wah of Reuters {{took several}} shots from room 1111 of the Beijing Hotel, {{but only the}} shot of Tank Man {{climbing}} the tank was chosen. It was not until several hours later that {{the photo of the}} man {{standing in front of the}} tank was finally chosen. When the staff noticed Widener's work, they re-checked Wah's negative <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> of the same moment as Widener's. On March 20, 2013, in an interview by the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (HKPPA), Wah told the story and added further detail. He told HKPPA that on the night of June 3, 1989, he was beaten by students while taking photos and was bleeding. A [...] "foreign" [...] photographer accompanying him suddenly said, [...] "I am not gonna die for your country," [...] and left. Wah returned to the hotel. When he decided to go out again, the public security stopped him, so he stayed in his room, stood next to the window and eventually witnessed the Tank Man and took several shots of the event.|$|E
2500|$|The idea of canoeing from Devizes to Westminster {{was first}} {{suggested}} by Roy Cooke, {{who had been}} part of a team who had attempted to canoe along the River Avon from Pewsey, near Devizes, to the sea at Christchurch in 1947. He then planned <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible to reach Westminster from Devizes in under 100 hours. At the time, much of the Kennet and Avon Canal was derelict, but still in water. He was unable to attempt the course, but a number of locals offered some money for Scout funds if the Devizes Scouts could succeed in [...] "taking a boat from Devizes to Westminster in under 100 hours, all food and camping kit to be carried in the boats". Four of the scouts, Peter Brown, Laurie Jones, Brian Smith and Brian Walters, all aged 17, attempted the route at Easter 1948. The event generated much interest, with some national press coverage, and a large crowd gathering at Westminster Bridge to see the end of the feat, which was completed in 89 hours 50 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, {{one year}} after their live debut and now dubbed the Stooges, the band signed with Elektra Records, again {{following}} in the footsteps of The Doors, who were Elektra's biggest act at the time (reportedly, Pop called Moe Howard <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all right to call his band [...] "The Stooges," [...] to which Howard responded by merely saying [...] "I don't care what they call themselves, as long as they're not the Three Stooges!" [...] and hung up the phone). The Stooges' first album The Stooges, (on which Pop was credited as [...] "Iggy Stooge"), was produced by John Cale in New York in 1969. Both it and the follow-up, Fun House produced by Don Gallucci in Los Angeles in 1970, sold poorly. Though the release of Fun House did not receive the recognition it expected, it was later ranked #191 in Rolling Stone's '500 Greatest Albums of All Time' in 2003. Shortly after the new members joined, the group disbanded because of Pop's worsening heroin addiction.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{numerous}} anecdotes of Henriette's career, and many stories {{from her own}} memoirs as well. One known incident, causing great amusement among the public, took place when she played Susanna in Figaro in 1821. The male singer who played Figaro, Edvard du Puy (the very same person {{who was responsible for}} the dismissal of Wässelia described above), invited her to his room to rehearse the play, but when she arrived he tried to seduce her. She declined the offer and left, which made him much disappointed. The next day she did not know her part, and du Puy then reported her to the director, who placed her on house arrest in her rooms for delaying the rehearsals. She was deeply angered by this treatment, and when the caretaker wanted to put extra locks on her door, she threatened to jump out of the window. [...] She was comforted by her colleagues, who visited her and cheered her up with a little party meant <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> legal to place women on arrest—unfortunately, it was; {{this was one of the}} disciplinary rules that the actors later demanded to be removed in the great strike led by Ulrik Torsslow and Sara Fredrica Strömstedt-Torsslow in 1827.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{incident}}, Burroughs claimed the [...] "William Tell" [...] incident never happened, {{and that he}} had dropped his gun and it had accidentally fired. Burroughs spent 13 days in jail before his brother came to Mexico City and bribed Mexican lawyers and officials to release Burroughs on bail while he awaited trial for the killing, which was ruled culpable homicide. Vollmer's daughter, Julie Adams, went to live with her grandmother, and William S. Burroughs Jr. went to St. Louis to live with his grandparents. Burroughs reported every Monday morning to the jail in Mexico City while his prominent Mexican attorney worked to resolve the case. According to James Grauerholz, two witnesses had agreed to testify that the gun had fired accidentally while he was checking <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> loaded, with ballistics experts bribed to support this story. Nevertheless, the trial was continuously delayed and Burroughs began to write what would eventually become the short novel Queer while awaiting his trial. Upon Burroughs's attorney fleeing Mexico in light of his own legal problems, Burroughs decided, according to Ted Morgan, to [...] "skip" [...] and return to the United States. He was convicted in absentia of homicide and was given a two-year suspended sentence.|$|E
2500|$|Lubezki was {{concerned}} that no film {{had been shot in}} the way Iñárritu envisioned, meaning there would be no reference material to look up. The two decided the only way to learn how to shoot it would be to shoot it themselves, so they hired a warehouse in Sony Studios, Los Angeles, and built a proxy stage. The setup was minimal. Canvas and C-stands were used for walls, while tape and a few pieces of furniture marked out areas. Using a camera and some stand-ins, the duo worked through the movie <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible. Realizing no theatre could accommodate the intricate camerawork they needed, they hired Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York. Still, Iñárritu wanted to shoot at a Broadway theater, but would have to wait until several weeks into rehearsals before securing St. James Theatre. They then spent a few months designing and making [...] "blueprints" [...] of the shots and blocking the scenes, using the stand-ins to read and walk through the script. The planning was precise. Iñárritu said [...] "There was no room to improvise at all. Every movement, every line, every door opening, absolutely everything was rehearsed." [...] The actors started rehearsing once this preliminary work was completed: according to Lubezki, they did the scenes with the actors [...] "once we kind of knew what the rhythm of the scenes were." [...] He described the atypical approach [...] "like an upside down movie where you do post-production before the production".|$|E
