5|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, Valiente {{became a member}} of a far right white {{nationalist}} political party, the National Front, for about eighteen months, during which she designed a banner for her local branch. Valiente's biographer Philip Heselton suggested that the party's nationalistic outlook may have appealed to her strongly patriotic values and that she might have hoped that the Front would serve as a political equivalent to the Pagan movement. At the same time she also {{became a member of}} another, more extreme far right group, the Northern League. However, she allowed her membership of the National Front <b>to</b> <b>lapse,</b> sending a letter to her local branch stating that although she respected its leader John Tyndall and had made friends within the group, she was critical of the party's opposition to women's liberation, gay rights, and sex education, all of which she lauded as progressive causes. Heselton has also suggested that Valiente may have joined these groups in order to investigate them before reporting back to Britain's intelligence agencies.|$|E

40|$|Smoking relapse is {{most often}} the end point of a process that unfolds {{over a period of}} days or weeks and is {{characterized}} by many intermittent <b>lapses.</b> According <b>to</b> Relapse Prevention theory, progression to relapse is driven by the Abstinence Violation Effect (AVE), a set of cognitive and emotional responses <b>to</b> <b>lapsing</b> that predisposes quitters <b>to</b> further <b>lapses</b> in an accelerating downward spiral. However, the dynamic relationship between lapse responses and relapse progression during smoking cessation has not been a focus of research. We used mixed-effect growth modeling and recurrent event survival analyses to investigate the way AVE-related lapse responses evolve {{over the course of a}} cessation attempt and prospectively influence subsequent lapse-relapse progression. Participants were 203 smokers who achieved abstinence and subsequently lapsed on one or more separate occasions. Using electronic diaries for Ecological Momentary Assessment, participants recorded their reactions <b>to</b> each <b>lapse</b> in real time. Findings revealed a great deal of variability between participants and from lapse-to-lapse in the severity of AVE responses, indicating that participants differed in the extent that their AVE responses intensified versus improved with each successive lapse. In turn, AVE response was found <b>to</b> explain subsequent <b>lapse</b> progression rates, above and beyond the predictive influence of other traditional explanatory variables. Results indicate that while participants' responses <b>to</b> the first <b>lapse</b> they experienced were unrelated to whether they ultimately relapsed, those who reported higher levels of self-efficacy following their first lapse had a slower rate of progression from each successive <b>lapse</b> <b>to</b> the next (HR= 0. 93, CI= 0. 89 - 0. 97). Controlling for responses <b>to</b> their initial <b>lapse,</b> we found that responses <b>to</b> each additional <b>lapse</b> influenced lapse progression rates, such that higher levels of both self-blame (HR= 0. 99, CI= 0. 98 - 0. 99) and self-efficacy (HR= 0. 95, CI= 0. 92 - 0. 99) were associated with slower progression <b>to</b> a subsequent <b>lapse.</b> Incremental increases in guilt from lapse-to-lapse were associated with slower progression <b>to</b> an additional <b>lapse</b> (HR= 0. 96, CI= 0. 92 - 0. 99), while increasingly negative affective valence from lapse-to-lapse was associated with accelerated lapse progression (HR= 1. 05, CI= 1. 00 - 1. 09). Results highlight the dynamic nature of lapse responses during smoking cessation, demonstrating the way psychological responses may drive progression from one <b>lapse</b> <b>to</b> the next...|$|R

Leane lived in Adelaide until his death at the Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park on 25 June 1962, with him and his wife celebrating their diamond wedding anniversary two weeks before his death. He was buried in Centennial Park Cemetery, and was survived by his wife, Edith, and six children: five sons and a daughter.

5|$|In September 2014, Modi {{introduced}} the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, {{with the goal}} of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub. Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market. In order to enable the construction of private industrial corridors, the Modi administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it. Under the previous bill, the government had required the consent of 80% of the owners of a piece of property before acquiring it for a private project: this requirement was waived. The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed <b>to</b> <b>lapse.</b> Modi's government put in place the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017.|$|E

5|$|When the Whitlam Government came {{to power}} in late 1972, the CMF was in a very poor state.

In 1973 a committee of inquiry into the CMF was announced, under the chairmanship of Dr. T.B Millar and the subsequent report developed from this inquiry became known as the Millar Report. Far from being a vehicle of the Regular Army to denigrate the CMF as some opponents predicted, the report did much to highlight many of the conceptual and structural problems that the CMF was afflicted by at the time, however, {{the way in which the}} government chose to implement the recommendations, and indeed the way in which some of them were allowed <b>to</b> <b>lapse,</b> ultimately served to at least partially justify some of the cynicism voiced in certain CMF circles about the report.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{develop an}} {{instrument}} for measuring medical educators' responses <b>to</b> learners' <b>lapses</b> in professional behavior. Method. In 1999, at the Indiana University School of Medicine, a 22 -item checklist of behaviors was developed to describe common responses used by educators responding <b>to</b> learners' <b>lapses</b> in professional behavior. Four medical students were trained <b>to</b> portray <b>lapses</b> in professional behaviors. These students and seven clinical observers trained to categorize behaviors as present or absent. Interrater reliability was assessed during 18 objective structured teaching evaluations (OSTEs). Videotaped OSTEs were coded twice at a one-month interval for test-retest reliability. Items were classified as low, moderate, or high inference behaviors. Script realism and educator effectiveness were assessed. Results. Educators rated OSTE scripts as realistic. Raters observed an average of 6 +/- 2 educator behaviors in reaction <b>to</b> learners' <b>lapses</b> in professional behavior. Educators' responses were rated as moderately effective. More experienced educators attempted more interventions and were more effective. Agreement was high among raters (86 % +/- 7 %), while intraclass correlation coefficients decreased with increasing inference level. From videotaped OSTEs, raters scored each behavior identically 86 % of the time. Conclusions. Accurate feedback on educators' interactions in addressing learners' professionalism is essential for faculty development. Traditionally, educators have felt that faculty's responses <b>to</b> learners' <b>lapses</b> in professional behavior were difficult to observe and categorize. These data suggest that educators' responses <b>to</b> learners' <b>lapses</b> in professional behavior can be defined and reliably coded. This work will help provide objective feedback to faculty when engaging learners about lapses in professional behavior...|$|R
