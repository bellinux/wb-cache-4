500|$|The {{critical}} and commercial success of The Bends gave Radiohead {{the confidence to}} self-produce their third album. Their label Parlophone gave them a £100,000 budget for recording equipment. Guitarist Jonny Greenwood said [...] "the only concept that we had for this album was <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to record {{it away from the}} city and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to record it ourselves." [...] According to guitarist Ed O'Brien: [...] "Everyone said, You'll sell six or seven million if you bring out The Bends Pt 2, and we're like, 'We'll kick against that and do the opposite'." [...] A number of producers, including major figures such as Scott Litt, were suggested, but the band were encouraged by their sessions with Godrich. They consulted him for advice on what equipment to use, and prepared for the sessions by buying their own equipment, including a plate reverberator purchased from Jona Lewie. Although Godrich had sought to focus his work on electronic dance music, he outgrew his role as advisor and became the album's co-producer.|$|E

500|$|After {{finishing}} film school, Australian director James Wan and Australian writer Leigh Whannell {{wanted to}} write and fund a film. The inspiration that they needed came after watching the low-budget independent film The Blair Witch Project. [...] Another film that inspired them to finance the film themselves was Darren Aronofsky's Pi. The two thought the cheapest script to shoot would involve two actors in one room. Whannell said, [...] "So I actually think the restrictions we had on our bank accounts at the time, the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to keep the film contained, helped us {{come up with the}} ideas in the film."

Iwata did the game's opening sequence and designed the map, overall layout, and bosses; and he oversaw all phases of the game's development. In a 2010 interview, Iwata said: [...] "we {{were trying to make}} the best action game to date, with all that entails. With SOPHIA (the game’s vehicle), we wanted to bring to life a sense of action that incorporated all 360° of the environment in a way that players hadn’t really experienced up to that point.

500|$|The staff {{opted for}} a more {{immersive}} storyline, with increased use of cut scenes and a plot that focused less on the Space Pirates and Metroids that permeate {{the rest of the}} series. Retro decided that the game would follow a theme of light and dark, which originated from [...] "something that everyone understands: the conflict between good and evil". Mike Wikan, the game's senior designer, elaborated on the theme: [...] "We wanted a push and pull, the whole game is pushing and pulling you {{back and forth between the}} dark and the light. It ended up being <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> something that would feed into that dichotomy, that conflict between the two, and how the player's basic abilities reflect that." [...] The developers asked the producers of , another Nintendo game, for advice because the game also used the theme of parallel worlds.|$|E

500|$|Folk metal {{has been}} {{associated}} with paganism ever since its inception, when Martin Walkyier left his former band Sabbat to form Skyclad, in part because the band [...] "wasn't going to go far enough down the pagan, British way <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to do it." [...] Consequently, the lyrics of Skyclad have been known to deal with pagan matters. The band Cruachan was also founded by a self-described pagan, Keith Fay. For Ville Sorvali of Moonsorrow, the label [...] "pagan metal" [...] is preferred [...] "because that describes the ideological points in the music, but doesn’t say anything about the music itself." [...] Other bands that also prefer to use the term [...] "pagan metal" [...] as a self-description include Cruachan, Eluveitie, Obtest and Skyforger. In contrast to bands with pagan themes, some folk metal bands such as Orphaned Land have themes of Abrahamic religion.|$|E

The whole inspiration for Åkerlund behind the look was Jonas, {{as well as the}} couple's interest in rock-n-roll. Madonna approved the design, saying that [...] "It was magical... It perfectly represented the vibe <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to bring to the video." [...] She also asked for a golf club and pocket knife to make the look more edgy. With Swedish broadcasting channel Sveriges Television, Åkerlund explained that for the opening shot, where Madonna is shown laying on the bed, she wanted boots which looked like leg braces. She contacted a designer in New York who said that he developed such pieces for fetish fashion. Åkerlund wanted him to provide the designs for arms also.|$|E

It's friendship, it's love, it's maturity and growth, and it's everything <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> it to be." [...] For {{the music of the}} album, the group tried challenging themselves, working with different arrangements, trying to create an original sound; to succeed in this, they were influenced by The Emotions, Jodeci and SWV mixing elements of their music. Destiny Fulfilled is predominantly an R concept album tracing a woman's relationship journey. Critics further found elements of soul music, dance and hip-hop. The album is mostly composed of mid and slowtempo balladry following the opening two songs; Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian felt that the ballads showcased [...] "the girliness in the trio, musically and lyrically". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine found elements of middle of the road music in the ballads.|$|E

[...] Parrilla also cited [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] as the first episode where viewers see [...] "how the two worlds collided," [...] a reference to Regina's ability to kill Graham by squeezing the heart of his fairytale counterpart. The revelation of the vault, Kitsis and Horowitz explained, [...] "is a very important thing for us in terms of moving forward in the season in <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to send a very clear message that Regina knows what’s going on and has some very clear intentions in Storybrooke."

[...] The initial draft of the hook featured the line [...] "If you kiss me then I’ll kiss you back", but according to Hilson {{in an interview with}} That Grape Juice, it was changed by unknown reason by Timbaland. After it was reported that In a Perfect World... would be pushed back to October 2008, [...] "Return the Favor" [...] surfaced online, and it was rumored to be the follow-up to [...] "Energy." [...] The sample was later removed by Hilson's management, before it was announced as the album's second single. The song was featured on December 15, 2008 episode of The Hills.|$|E

500|$|Filming for the Superman Returns sequel was {{to start}} in mid-2007, before Singer halted {{development}} in favor of Valkyrie. Filming was then pushed to March 2008, but writers Dougherty and Dan Harris left in favor of other career opportunities. The 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike pushed the release date to 2010. Singer still listed the sequel as a priority in March 2008, saying that the film was in early development. Routh expected filming to begin in early 2009. Paul Levitz, president of DC Comics, expected Routh to reprise the title role from Superman Returns before his contract for a sequel expired in 2009. However, with Warner Bros. deciding to reboot the film series, Singer dropped {{out in favor of}} directing Jack the Giant Slayer. In August 2008, Warner Bros. President of Production Jeff Robinov reflected, [...] "Superman Returns didn't quite work as a film in the way <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> it to.

[...] In February 2009, McG, who previously planned to direct Superman: Flyby, expressed interest in returning to the Superman franchise. August 2009 saw a court ruling in which Jerry Siegel's family recaptured 50% of the rights to Superman's origins and Siegel's share of the copyright in Action Comics#1. In addition, a judge ruled that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films. However, if they did not begin production on a Superman film by 2011, then the Siegel estate {{would have been able to}} sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film.|$|E
