5|$|Although flat designs {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> because the designs shield the condensing surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by the lower atmosphere, and, being symmetrical, they are not sensitive to wind direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{reactive}} feed-forward system {{refers to}} an incompletely understood system that induces renal potassium secretion in response to potassium ingestion prior to any rise in the plasma potassium. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> initiated by gut cell potassium receptors that detect ingested potassium and trigger vagal afferent signals to the pituitary gland.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} partly self-compatible, as some seed is set when pollinators are excluded. Selection against self-pollinated seed has been observed, but the species has {{nonetheless}} {{been shown to}} have one of the lowest outcrossing rates of any Banksia. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> caused by the small population sizes, which increase the probability of self-fertilisation, and may discourage visits by pollinators.|$|E
50|$|The {{first time}} a John Wood is {{mentioned}} in the sources is when one plays for Caterham against Hambledon in 1769. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> the Surrey-based player.

5|$|Although a 2007 study {{estimated}} that introducing DST to Japan would reduce household lighting energy consumption, a 2007 simulation {{estimated that}} DST would increase overall energy use in Osaka residences by 0.13%, with a 0.02% decrease due to less lighting more than outweighed by a 0.15% increase due to extra cooling; neither study examined non-residential energy use. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> because DST's effect on lighting energy use is mainly noticeable in residences.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{element is}} that the tale draws its {{characters}} from essentially the same cast as Táin Bó Cuailnge, making mention of some thirty heroes from that narrative, yet never once mentions Cú Chulainn. Chadwick suggests <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> {{an indication of the}} antiquity of the tradition of the story's tradition, predating the development of Cú Chulainn's story within the Ulster Cycle. Some of the rhetorical verse elements are old and obscure, but certain seemingly parodic elements of the genre at least suggest a later composition of the present form.|$|E
5|$|Extant East Asian {{starling}}s, {{such as the}} Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the {{white-headed starling}} (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities with these extinct species in colouration and other features. As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings {{seem to be more}} closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> due to the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.|$|E

5|$|In the original, 7th-century charter {{recording}} this grant, Reculver {{is referred}} to as a civitas, or city, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a reference to either its Roman past or the church's monastic status, rather than a large population centre. In 692 Reculver's abbot Berhtwald was elected Archbishop of Canterbury, from which position he probably offered Reculver patronage and support. Bede, writing no more than 40 years later, described Berhtwald as having been well educated in the Bible and experienced in ecclesiastical and monastic affairs, but in terms indicating that Berhtwald was not a scholar.|$|E
5|$|Some teleosts are parasites. Remoras {{have their}} front dorsal fins {{modified}} into large suckers {{with which they}} cling onto a host animal such as a whale, sea turtle, shark or ray, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a commensal rather than parasitic arrangement because both remora and host benefit from the removal of ectoparasites and loose flakes of skin. More harmful are the catfish that enter the gill chambers of fish and feed on their blood and tissues. The snubnosed eel, though usually a scavenger, sometimes bores into the flesh of a fish, and has been found inside {{the heart of a}} shortfin mako shark.|$|E
5|$|The Hippocratic Oath, {{a seminal}} {{document}} on {{the ethics of}} medical practice, was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity although new information shows {{it may have been}} written after his death. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> the most famous document of the Hippocratic Corpus. Recently the authenticity of the document's author has come under scrutiny. While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today, it serves as a foundation for other, similar oaths and laws that define good medical practice and morals. Such derivatives are regularly taken today by medical graduates about to enter medical practice.|$|E

5|$|The most {{enduring}} Roman legacy {{may be that}} created by Hadrian's Wall. Its line approximates the border between modern Scotland and England and it created {{a distinction between the}} northern third and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain that plays a part in modern political debate. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> coincidental however, as there is little to suggest its influence {{played an important role in}} the early Medieval period after the fall of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the blue}} whale is renowned {{for being the}} largest animal ever to have lived. In part because of its legendary status, many misconceptions still exist. For example, its size is often exaggerated. Many popular sources give the maximum length as 110 feet (33.5 meters) or more. While such lengths were {{reported}} in the whaling records, they were not scientifically verified and were probably exaggerated. Virtually all books and articles that mention the blue whale claim that it can reach 100 feet (30.5 meters). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> true (the largest verified specimen was 29.9 meters, 98 feet) but is highly misleading as the average size is much smaller.|$|E
5|$|While {{still in}} Madras, Ramanujan {{recorded}} {{the bulk of}} his results in four notebooks of loose-leaf paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> the origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician Bruce C. Berndt, in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.|$|E

5|$|According to a phylogenetic {{analysis}} of evidence from morphology, the nuclear gene IRBP, and the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b, Drymoreomys albimaculatus is most {{closely related to}} Eremoryzomys polius, an oryzomyine from northern Peru and the only species in the genus Eremoryzomys. Together, Drymoreomys and Eremoryzomys are part of Marcelo Weksler's clade D, one of four main clades within Oryzomyini. Some subsequent studies did not support {{a relationship between the}} Drymoreomys–Eremoryzomys clade and the rest of clade D, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> due to saturation of the phylogenetic signal in mitochondrial data. Oryzomyini includes well over a hundred species distributed mainly in South America, including nearby islands such as the Galápagos Islands and some of the Antilles. It is one of several tribes recognized within the subfamily Sigmodontinae, which encompasses hundreds of species found across South America and into southern North America. Sigmodontinae is the largest subfamily of the family Cricetidae, other members of which include voles, lemmings, hamsters, and deermice, all mainly from Eurasia and North America.|$|E
5|$|Phocas's rule lacked {{legitimacy}} and quickly {{came to be}} resented by the populace and the elites of the Byzantine Empire. What prestige he had further eroded when the Persian shah Khosrau II (r. 590–628) declared war, and when the Byzantine forces began to suffer their first defeats. According to a later tradition, Priscus {{sent a letter to}} the Exarch of Africa, Heraclius the Elder, urging him to revolt. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a later invention, but if true, it would indicate the level of dissent even within Constantinople. Whatever the truth of the matter, in 608 Africa rose in revolt, and the Exarch's son, Heraclius the Younger, was dispatched against Constantinople at the head of a fleet. Unopposed by Phocas's forces, he landed at the suburb of Hebdomon on October 3 and marched to the capital, where pro-Heraclian riots had broken out. At this juncture, Priscus pretended to be ill, and withdrew to his mansion at the Boraïdou quarter, where he assembled the excubitores and his own retainers (bucellarii), thus depriving Phocas of his main source of armed support. He is also recorded by John of Nikiu to have safeguarded the women of Heraclius's family from retribution by Phocas.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of baleen {{whales are}} {{relatively}} small for their size and are positioned {{near the end of}} the mouth. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> because they feed on slow or immobile prey, combined with the fact that most sunlight does not pass , and hence they do not need acute vision. A whale's eye is adapted for seeing both in the euphotic and aphotic zones by increasing or decreasing the pupil's size to prevent damage to the eye. As opposed to land mammals which have a flattened lens, whales have a spherical lens. The retina is surrounded by a reflective layer of cells (tapetum lucidum), which bounces light back at the retina, enhancing eyesight in dark areas. However, light is bent more near the surface of the eye when in air as opposed to water; consequently, they can see much better in the air than in the water. The eyeballs are protected by a thick outer layer to prevent abrasions, and an oily fluid (instead of tears) on the surface of the eye. Baleen whales appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones.|$|E
