60|$|If {{speculation}} tends thus to {{a terrific}} unity, {{in which all}} things are absorbed, action tends directly backwards to diversity. The first is the course of gravitation of mind; {{the second is the}} power of nature. Nature is the manifold. The unity absorbs, and melts or reduces. Nature opens and creates. These two principles reappear and interpenetrate all things, all thought; the one, the many. One is being; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> intellect; one is necessity; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> freedom; one, rest; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> motion; one, power; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> distribution; one, strength; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> pleasure; one, consciousness; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> definition; one, genius; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> talent, one, earnestness; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> knowledge; one, possession; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> trade; one, caste; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> culture; one king; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> democracy; and, if we dare carry these generalizations a step higher, and name the last tendency of both, we might say, {{that the end of the}} one is escape from organization,--pure science; and the end of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> is <b>the</b> highest instrumentality, or use of means, or executive deity.|$|R

The creature insists it is not an evil monster, but an intelligent alien who has come to Earth to save the human race from its own self-destructive tendencies. It explains that Corcoran's body has been implanted with its embryos, which will allow the alien species to multiply and take over the human race, which the creature claims {{is the only way to}} truly save humanity. Upon realizing the creature is forcing the will of its species on the human race, Corcoran concludes the creature is evil after all and commits suicide so its embryos cannot come to fruition. <b>The</b> <b>others</b> then throw their explosives and kill the creature, which in its dying breaths warns that others from his species are waiting in space and will return one day to conquer humanity.|$|E
