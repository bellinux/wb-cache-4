40|$|In {{the last}} years the concept of {{parallel}} RF transmission has gained considerable interest, especially {{in the domain of}} high field MRI. In essence two principal application domains have emerged from this concept: the field of static B 1 -inhomogeneity compensation, also known as B 1 -shimming [1, 2, 3], and the technique of accelerated spatially-selective excitation (SSE), also known as Parallel Excitation (PEX) or Transmit SENSE [4, 5], for improving the performance of many useful applications of SSE such as inner-volume imaging or targeted spectroscopy. In the field of B 1 -shimming the demands on the RF system are moderate. The RF system must only be capable of generating the same RF pulse on different channels with individual, but time-constant amplitude scaling and phase offsets. This can be realized by RF splitters, amplitude modulators and phase shifters. In contrast, to perform PEX-experiments the RF system must be capable of generating different complex RF waveforms on multiple <b>transmit</b> <b>channels</b> with high accuracy. Recently, several experimental studies of PEX with 4 and 8 <b>transmit</b> <b>channels</b> have been performed [6, 7, 8] and {{it has been shown that}} for doing PEX with high spatial resolution and high acceleration factors, the RF system must be equipped with a sufficient number of <b>transmit</b> <b>channels.</b> Therefore, the aim of this work was to develop a multichannel transmit extension for a broadband RF electronics with the potential of driving large numbers of <b>transmit</b> <b>channels</b> and to implement this electronics concept on a 9. 4 T animal scanner with 8 <b>transmit</b> and receive <b>channels...</b>|$|R

40|$|Polarization {{transfer}} {{techniques are}} used to enhance sensitivity and improve localization in multinuclear MRS, by transferring polarization from highly polarized or even hyperpolarized nuclei to less sensitive spin systems. Clinical MR scanners are in general not equipped with a second radio frequency (RF) <b>transmit</b> <b>channel,</b> making the conventional implementation of polarization transfer techniques such as distortionless enhanced polarization transfer (DEPT) impossible. Here we present a DEPT sequence using pulses sequentially {{that can be used}} on a single RF <b>transmit</b> <b>channel</b> (SC-DEPT). Theoretical simulations, phantom measurements, and in vivo results from human brain at 3 T show that the SC-DEPT method performs as well as the conventional DEPT method. The results indicate that an independent second RF <b>transmit</b> <b>channel</b> for simultaneous pulsing at different nuclear frequencies is not needed for polarization transfer, facilitating the use of these methods with common clinical systems with minor modifications in the RF architecture.

30|$|As expected, the {{spectrum}} peaks for each output are quite dissymmetric, {{indicating that the}} transmitted polarizations are quasi-circular. Output # 1 alone has a component at frequency 5.000 kHz: this {{can be interpreted as}} the generation by <b>transmit</b> <b>channel</b> # 1 of a circular polarization that fits combiner # 1. However, if output # 2 has a major component at frequency 5.005 kHz, a residual peak of output # 1 is visible with an amplitude ratio of nearly − 10 dB. This observation suggests that the polarization excited at <b>transmit</b> <b>channel</b> # 2 is not perfectly circular. Nevertheless, this small imperfection should not prevent the project from going further.|$|E

The adaptive selection algorithms are configured for single-antenna bandwidth-efficient or power-efficient transmission with as low <b>transmit</b> <b>channel</b> estimations as possible. Due {{to the fact that}} the number of active co-channel interfering signals and their corresponding powers experience random behavior, the adaptation to channels conditions, assuming uniform buffer and traffic loading, is proposed to be jointly based on the transmit channels instantaneous signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and signal-to- interference-plus- noise ratios (SINRs). Two interference cancelation algorithms, which are the dominant cancelation and the less complex arbitrary cancelation, are considered, for which the receive antenna array is assumed to have small angular spread. Analytical formulation for some performance measures in addition to several processing complexity and numerical comparisons between various adaptation schemes are presented. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E

30|$|Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar is a {{relatively}} new term in the radar field, inspired by the MIMO technique in communications. MIMO radar has multiple <b>transmit</b> <b>channels</b> and multiple receive <b>channels,</b> and the <b>transmit</b> <b>channels</b> can be separated by waveforms, or time, or frequencies, or polarizations at each receiver. So the number of channels of a MIMO radar is increased substantially compared to its single-input multiple-output counterparts. Most of the advantages of the MIMO radar come from increasing the number of channels. Two main classes of MIMO radar have been proposed: with widely separated antennas [1] and with co-located antennas [2]. The first class utilizes the different scattering properties of a target from sufficiently spaced antennas to improve the performance of the systems. The second class allows the improvement of the radar performances by coherent processing the multiple channels.|$|R
