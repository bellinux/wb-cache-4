5|$|Prior to the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR)'s publication, the {{retirement}} of the entire Tornado fleet was under consideration, savings of £7.5billion were anticipated. The SDSR announced the Tornado would be retained {{at the expense of}} the Harrier II, although Tornado numbers are to decline in <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Eurofighter Typhoon, and later on, the F-35 Lightning II.|$|E
5|$|Another {{change was}} the <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> use of judges as the electoral {{returning}} officer for South Australia. This {{was done to}} impose state control on a system which had effectively combined {{the administration of the}} national and state electoral rolls. On 27 May 1925, Denny arranged the appointment of Judge Herbert Kingsley Paine of the Insolvency Court to be appointed as Electoral Officer for the state, replacing Charles Mathews, a state public servant who had held the position since 1907. Denny had previously worked for Paine as a legal associate.|$|E

50|$|In 1966, the New Hampshire Air National Guard {{relocated}} the 157th Military Airlift Group (157 MAG) {{from the}} deactivating Grenier AFB in nearby Manchester, New Hampshire, to Pease AFB.

5|$|Daniel met {{his wife}} Marinette in his {{hometown}} Örnsköldsvik around 1998. She came with him to Vancouver upon the start of Daniel's NHL career in 2000, and the two married in 2005. After earning a bachelor's degree in psychology at the University of British Columbia Marinette became involved with the Canucks Family Education Centre, helping female immigrants <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English language. Together, they have two daughters, Ronja (born in 2006) and Anna (born in March 2011), and a son, Erik (born in 2008). They live in the Vancouver neighbourhood of Shaughnessy during the NHL season, returning to Sweden every summer.|$|E
5|$|Double deck buses show an {{intermediate}} points display, {{as well as}} a final destination. The company's double decker buses are unique in Scotland in still displaying the destination at both the front and rear. In early mornings and late evenings, some services are curtailed to the city centre or to early termini, in the <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> night bus service. In such cases, 'Part Route' is displayed in the intermediate display. Certain routes have all day short working termini, and minor diversions which are often indicated through the use of internal or external 'tram boards'. Since 2006 double-deck deliveries feature a 'Route Diverted; intermediate display, used when road closures cause a service to be diverted from its normal route.|$|E
5|$|Doug Wickenheiser was {{selected}} by Montreal with the first pick at the 1980 NHL Entry Draft. The decision was highly controversial as the fans in Montreal had hoped the team would take francophone star Denis Savard. Wickenheiser's <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NHL was difficult; his popularity was harmed by comparisons of his struggles to Savard's immediate success with the Black Hawks. He {{was traded to the}} Blues midway through the 1983–84 season.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 70's the {{squadron}} flew the J-65 powered A-4L before <b>transitioning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> newer J52-P-408 powered A-4F.

5|$|During George's reign, {{the powers}} of the monarchy diminished and Britain began a <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> modern system of cabinet {{government}} led by a prime minister. Towards the end of his reign, actual political power was held by Robert Walpole, now recognised as Britain's first de facto prime minister. George died of a stroke on a trip to his native Hanover, where he was buried.|$|E
5|$|Hansen {{played his}} first full season with the Canucks in 2008–09, making the roster out {{training}} camp and establishing himself as a third-line forward. He became known as a player for his speed and work ethic, lending to his effectiveness in puck-pursuit and forechecking. Also responsible defensively, he began to be used consistently on the penalty kill. Hansen has recalled the <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NHL requiring a change in his style of play to incorporate more physicality and abrasiveness. Prior to making the NHL, he relied more on skill and finesse, having been a go-to offensive player for teams up to that point.|$|E
5|$|Management Development Programmes (MDP) are {{tailor made}} {{programs}} to train executives in specific industry, government, and non-governmental organisations. These programs, which typically last {{three to five}} days, are customised by subject or target group. Around 50 to 60 programs are conducted every year. A one-year General Management program is offered through virtual classroom. As a combined initiative with the Ministry of Defence, a six-month General Management Programme is conducted for Defence officers to assist their career <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corporate sector.|$|E

5|$|Mutations {{that affect}} the rate or the extent of RCL {{insertion}} into the A-sheet can cause the serpin to undergo its S to R conformational change before having engaged a protease. Since a serpin can only make this conformational change once, the resulting misfired serpin is inactive and unable to properly control its target protease. Similarly, mutations that promote inappropriate <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monomeric latent state cause disease by {{reducing the amount of}} active inhibitory serpin. For example, the disease-linked antithrombin variants wibble and wobble, both promote formation of the latent state.|$|E
5|$|Raetia {{maintained}} its Roman traditions {{longer than the}} rest of Switzerland, but most of it was eventually assimilated as well, leaving only a small territory where a Vulgar Latin dialect, Romansh, is spoken to this day. The assassination of Aetius in 454 and the subsequent retreat of Roman forces to the south of the Alps marked the definitive end of Roman power in Switzerland, {{and the beginning of the}} <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Selected by the Portland Winter Hawks of the Western Hockey League (WHL) 33rd {{overall in}} the 2005 Canadian Hockey League (CHL) Import Draft, Hansen moved to North America and joined the club for the 2005–06 season. Hansen's {{proficiency}} in English {{played a part in}} Winter Hawks general manager Ken Hodge selecting him. Canucks management also wanted him playing major junior in order to better his <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> more physical North American style of play. Becoming the first Danish player to compete in the WHL, Hansen scored at a point-per-game pace, leading all rookies with 64 points. He continued his scoring pace in the playoffs with 13 points in 12 games as Portland was eliminated in the second round.|$|E

On 8 December 2005, Lieutenant General James Amos, commander of II Marine Expeditionary Force, accepted delivery of the first fleet of MV-22s, delivered to HMM-263. The unit reactivated on 3 March 2006 as the first MV-22 squadron, redesignated as VMM-263. On 23 March 2007, HMM-266 became Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 266 (VMM-266) at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The novel's {{central theme}} {{involves}} {{the examination of}} the human desire to detect patterns or meaning and the risks of finding patterns in meaningless data. Other themes include methods of interpretation of history, cultural familiarity with brand names, and tensions between art and commercialization. The September 11, 2001 attacks are used as a motif representing the <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new century. Critics identify influences in Pattern Recognition from Thomas Pynchon's postmodern detective story The Crying of Lot 49.|$|E
5|$|There are 1019 {{students}} in the school aged 11 to 18; the lower school is all boys, but of 350students aged 16–18 in the sixth form, up to 60 are girls.

5|$|Trade routes {{not only}} {{supplied}} physical goods, they facilitated {{the movement of}} people and ideas throughout Mesoamerica. Shifts in trade routes occurred with {{the rise and fall}} of important cities in the Maya region, and have been identified in every major reorganization of the Maya civilization, such as the rise of Preclassic Maya civilization, the <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Classic, and the Terminal Classic collapse. Even the Spanish Conquest did not immediately terminate all Maya trading activity; for example, the Contact period Manche Ch'ol traded the prestige crops of cacao, annatto and vanilla into colonial Verapaz.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} to Colt's success was {{vigorous}} protection of his patent rights. Even though he lawfully held the only patent on a revolver, scores of imitators copied {{his work and}} Colt found himself constantly in litigation. In {{each one of these}} cases, Colt's lawyer, Edward N. Dickerson, deftly exploited the patent system and successfully shut down Colt's competitors. However, Colt's zealous protection of his patents greatly impeded firearms development as a whole in the United States. His preoccupation with patent infringement suits slowed his own company's <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cartridge system and blocked other firms from pursuing revolver designs. At the same time, Colt's policies forced some competing inventors to greater innovation by denying them key features of his mechanism; as a result they created their own.|$|E
5|$|Although the new Phantoms were {{assigned}} a British designation as the F.3, they were generally {{referred to as}} the F-4J(UK). They {{were assigned}} to 74 Squadron at RAF Wattisham, which stood up in October 1984, two months after the first flight. The aircraft remained in service through the <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tornado, which began entering service in 1987. In 1990, thanks to the conversion of F-4M squadrons to the Tornado, the RAF were able to transfer the best of its remaining FGR.2s to 74 Squadron, which meant that the F.3 was able to be withdrawn in January 1991. With a couple of exceptions, all of the RAF's F-4Js were broken up for scrap. One of the 15 airframes was lost in a crash in 1987, killing both crew members.|$|E
