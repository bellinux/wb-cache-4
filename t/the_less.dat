5|$|The more {{commonly}} spoken languages dominate <b>the</b> <b>less</b> commonly spoken languages, so <b>the</b> <b>less</b> commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The {{total number of}} languages {{in the world is}} not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus is that there are between 6,000 and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100. The top 20 languages, those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.|$|E

5|$|Though general {{diffusion}} damping can damp perturbations in collisionless dark matter simply due to photon dispersion, the term Silk damping {{applies only to}} damping of adiabatic models of baryonic matter, which is coupled to the diffusing photons, not dark matter, and diffuses with them. Silk damping is not as significant in models of cosmological development which posit early isocurvature fluctuations (i.e. fluctuations which do not require a constant ratio of baryons and photons). In this case, increases in baryon density do not require a corresponding increases in photon density, and the lower the photon density, <b>the</b> <b>less</b> diffusion there would be: <b>the</b> <b>less</b> diffusion, <b>the</b> <b>less</b> damping. Photon diffusion is not dependent on {{the causes of the}} initial fluctuations in the density of the universe.|$|E
5|$|Wipeout 3 is {{a racing}} game that retains {{the same basic}} {{elements}} of its predecessors, and introduces players to the F7200 Anti-Gravity Race League. Set in 2116, Players control futuristic anti-gravity ships owned by racing corporations and pilot them on eight circuits (plus four hidden prototype tracks). Each craft is equipped with an energy shield that absorbs damage sustained on the track; if the shield is disabled, the player's craft can be knocked out of the race. Shields are regenerated in a pit lane that is set apart from the main course. <b>The</b> <b>less</b> {{time spent in the}} pit lane, <b>the</b> <b>less</b> the shield will regenerate.|$|E

5|$|AMD chose a {{different}} direction, designing <b>the</b> <b>less</b> radical x86-64, a 64-bit extension {{to the existing}} x86 architecture, which Microsoft then supported, forcing Intel to introduce the same extensions in its own x86-based processors. These designs can run existing 32-bit applications at native hardware speed, while offering support for 64-bit memory addressing and other enhancements to new applications. This architecture has now become the predominant 64-bit architecture in the desktop and portable market. Although some Itanium-based workstations were initially introduced by companies such as SGI, {{they are no longer}} available.|$|E
5|$|After a broad {{review of}} its {{tactical}} force structure, the U.S. Air Force decided {{to adopt a}} low-cost aircraft to supplement the F-4 and F-111. It first focused on the Northrop F-5, which had air-to-air capability. A 1965 cost-effectiveness study shifted the focus from the F-5 to <b>the</b> <b>less</b> expensive LTV A-7D, and a contract was awarded. However, this aircraft doubled in cost with demands for an upgraded engine and new avionics.|$|E

30|$|Even though {{total and}} average {{hospital}} charges {{have increased in}} the total Medicare population, both the over and under 65  year old combined groups, the women over 65 age group, and the total population group showed a significant decreased trend in the average hospital stay. However, since both <b>the</b> men <b>less</b> than 65 and <b>the</b> women <b>less</b> than 65 groups did not show a significant decreased trend, {{it is possible that}} the significant trend in <b>the</b> combined <b>less</b> than 65 group is an artifact. <b>The</b> women <b>less</b> than 65 group essentially shows no change in their average hospital stay while <b>the</b> men <b>less</b> than 65 start high at 9  days then drop down to only 6 and 5  days in the last 2  years. This decrease in the last 2  years happened too late in the study period to affect the overall trend in this group, but when averaged with the women under 65 in <b>the</b> combined <b>less</b> than 65 age group, it was able to form a trend.|$|R

5|$|All {{recipes are}} written in the second-person {{singular}} imperative, a grammatical form {{that would not have}} been used to address a person of high rank. The instructions were most likely meant to be read aloud by the chef or one of senior cooks to junior members of the kitchen staff, who would carry them out.

5|$|Although {{historically}} {{many fish}} species used Aliso Creek, {{the only remaining}} one is carp, which is known to survive in areas with high toxicity. Bird life was also abundant in the watershed—and 137species remain in <b>the</b> <b>less</b> developed areas of the watershed. Some of these birds include California least tern, least Bell's vireo, southwestern willow flycatcher, California gnatcatcher, and western snowy plover.

50|$|Lake Clarke Shores {{is located}} {{adjacent}} to the cities of West Palm Beach and Lake Worth. Direct access to those cities is by Forest Hill Boulevard and Keller Road respectively.

5|$|Another novel {{aspect of}} the {{offensive}} used by the attackers, which was extensively commented upon by American journalist Timothy Turner who was observing the battle from El Paso, was the rotation of troops that the rebels employed. Rather than attacking en masse with the whole army, Villa and Orozco had their soldiers engage the enemy for a few hours, {{then go back to}} secure positions to sleep, while other rebels took their place. As a consequence the rebel troops were always rested while <b>the</b> <b>less</b> numerous defending federal troops were forced to remain sleepless and ever vigilant.|$|E

5|$|Bats are {{the second}} largest order of mammals (after the rodents), {{representing}} about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide, with about 1,240 bat species divided into two suborders: <b>the</b> <b>less</b> specialized and largely fruit-eating megabats, including flying foxes, and the highly specialized and echolocating microbats. About 70% of bat species are insectivores. Most of the rest are frugivores, or fruit eaters.
