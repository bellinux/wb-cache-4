5|$|It is {{difficult}} to make a precise measurement, due to the difficulty in accurately calibrating <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> used, {{and the problem of}} spatial coverage. Nonetheless, the effect is almost certainly present.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{movement}} has aspects {{of both a}} fugue and a ritornello movement. In the first fugal section, the voices enter in the sequence tenor, alto, soprano I, soprano II, bass, expanding from middle range to the extreme parts, just as the theme expands from the repeated first notes to sighing motives leading upwards. In the second fugal section, <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> begin in low registers, and the voices build, with every part first in extremely low range, from bass to soprano I. In both sections, <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> open the fugue, but play with the voices once they enter.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the tripod}} is {{positioned}} and secure, <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> {{is placed on}} the head. The mounting screw is pushed up under <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> to engage <b>the</b> <b>instrument's</b> base and screwed tight when <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> is in <b>the</b> correct position. The flat surface of the tripod head is called the foot plate and is used to support the adjustable feet of <b>the</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> {{insertion}} device (1) {{consists of two}} seal structures that have a tricuspid valve (2) and a lipseal valve (3) respectively, forming respective passageways (6, 8) through which <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> is inserted. <b>The</b> passageway (6) moves from closed state to open state as <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> is inserted and automatically moves from open state to close state as <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> is removed. <b>The</b> passageway (8) moves from open state to closed state as <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> is inserted and automatically move from closed state to open state as <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> is removed...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{translate}} the Work-Related Activities Questionnaire into Brazilian Portuguese and to evaluate its cross-cultural adaptation among {{a sample of}} Brazilian workers. Methods: International standard recommendations were followed to translate and back-translate <b>the</b> <b>instrument,</b> and to establish the cross-cultural adaptation of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> using content experts and pretest. A field testing of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> was conducted with 40 Brazilian workers. Results: The procedure used to establish the cross-cultural adaptation of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> {{was found to be}} adequate. The panels of experts evaluated the initial content validity of the items of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> and suggested necessary revisions to achieve an acceptable content validity. In the pretest, 7. 5 % of individuals suggested changes in one of the items of <b>the</b> <b>instrument.</b> In addition, 17. 5 % of the individuals reported having difficulty understanding the instructions to complete <b>the</b> <b>instrument.</b> These findings led to further revision of <b>the</b> <b>instrument.</b> Conclusion: <b>The</b> Brazilian version of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> was adequately cross-culturally adapted and validated...|$|R
5|$|A Simple Plans film {{score was}} {{produced}} and composed by Danny Elfman, who {{was drawn to}} the project after learning that Raimi would be directing the film; the film marked his third collaboration with Raimi. <b>The</b> <b>instruments</b> included alto and bass flutes, re-tuned pianos and banjos, zithers, and hand drums. The soundtrack album, titled A Simple Plan: Music from the Motion Picture Soundtrack, was released on January 26, 1999.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the case}} of its {{predecessor}} Landsat 1, the satellite's payload included two remote sensing instruments, the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) and the Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS). The specifications for these instruments were identical to those of <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> carried on Landsat 1. The data acquired by the MSS was considered more scientifically useful than the data returned from the RBV, which was rarely used and considered only for engineering evaluation purposes.|$|E
5|$|Assante and Banderas {{did their}} own singing, and studied to master <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> their {{characters}} {{use in the}} film. Assante practiced on drums, preparing for {{a scene in which}} his character plays a musical number with Tito Puente. Banderas worked to mimic the correct posture and finger placements for his character's trumpet performances, while the actual playing was performed by Arturo Sandoval.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>instrument's</b> body is very small, but its {{fingerboard}} is made long {{relative to}} <b>the</b> <b>instrument's</b> overall size {{in order to}} preserve as much of <b>the</b> <b>instrument's</b> melodic range as possible.|$|R
50|$|The overall {{shape of}} <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> varied, but four forms were {{commonly}} illustrated, <b>the</b> holly-leaf shaped <b>instruments,</b> <b>the</b> T-shaped, <b>the</b> vase-shaped <b>instruments</b> and <b>the</b> spade-shaped <b>instruments.</b>|$|R
30|$|An {{instrument}} must satisfy two restrictions. First, {{it should}} be relevant: in other words, the variation in <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> must {{be related to the}} variation in <b>the</b> <b>instrumented</b> variable. Second, <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> must satisfy <b>the</b> exclusion restriction, meaning that it should not be related to the outcome of interest rather than through <b>the</b> <b>instrumented</b> variable (Wooldridge, 2002).|$|R
5|$|Astronomers use the WHT {{to conduct}} {{scientific}} research across most branches of observational astronomy, including solar system science, galactic astronomy, extragalactic astronomy and cosmology. Most of <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> {{are designed to}} be useful for a range of different research.|$|E
5|$|At eleven {{moments in}} the Passion, stanzas from Lutheran chorales reflect the narration. Possibly Bach had an {{influence}} on their selection. He set them all in common time for four parts, <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> playing colla parte with the voices.|$|E
5|$|Boosey & Hawkes' musical {{instruments}} division was gradually scaled {{down from the}} mid-1970s as it became less viable to have such an extensive range of products. Various lines were outsourced and sold off. By {{the time of the}} closure of the Edgware factory in 2001, brass instruments were the only thriving part of the instrument range. Production was moved to Watford, Hertfordshire, and <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> rebranded Besson.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> {{generates a}} buzzing {{sound from the}} slit between the two tongues when <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> is struck against the lower palm of {{the hand of the}} player. Furthermore, the sound can be altered by {{covering}} and uncovering a hole found on the bottom half of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> with <b>the</b> thumb of the hand which grasps <b>the</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... {{ensuring}} {{the freedom of}} both hands such that they have free access to <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> and can meet all technical demands without having to be occupied with supporting <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> or keeping <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> upright ...|$|R
50|$|Haydamaka {{first became}} {{interested}} in the bandura in 1913-14. He took an instrument from his school orchestra to <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> maker S. Snehiriov for repairs, and he saw there an unknown instrument. Snehiriov explained that <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> was a Ukrainian folk instrument known as a bandura, and that he was making <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> for <b>the</b> bandurist-artist of the Kharkiv drama theatre - I. Bondarenko. The bandura interested the young Haydamaka greatly, and Haydamaka ordered an instrument for himself. When the bandura was ready, the question arose - where to learn to play <b>the</b> <b>instrument?</b> Haydamaka chased down Bondarenko and asked him to tune up <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> and show him some initial exercises. He later devised exercises and pieces for <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> by himself and began to arrange pieces for <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> himself.|$|R
5|$|But now my {{attitude}} {{is getting to}} be a little different, I think. Now my concern is mostly to find out what there is in common... Autumn was written after November Steps. I really wanted to do something which I hadn't done in November Steps, not to blend <b>the</b> <b>instruments,</b> but to integrate them.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s, the {{observatory}} had become crowded by {{the rapidly growing}} university. Electrification of the tramways along College Street just to the south, and the large quantities of metal used in the modern buildings surrounding the site threw off <b>the</b> <b>instruments.</b> A new magnetic observatory opened in 1898 in Agincourt, at that time largely empty fields, leaving the downtown campus location with its meteorological and solar observation duties.|$|E
5|$|Cheap at Half the Price was {{recorded}} by Frith {{at his home}} in New York City on a 4-track machine. He played all <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> himself, with the exception of bass guitar on two tracks, and drums, for which he used tapes and samples previously recorded by other drummers. The record differed from Frith's previous experimental albums in that it consisted largely of pop-like songs, and he sang for the first time.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>instrument's</b> eerie {{wavering}} {{notes are}} produced by varying the frequency of oscillation in vacuum tubes. The production of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> stopped in 1988, but several conservatories in France still offer instruction to students of <b>the</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|R
50|$|The three {{rings are}} {{oriented}} {{with respect to}} the local meridian, the planet's equator, and a celestial object. <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> itself {{can be used as a}} plumb bob to align it with <b>the</b> vertical. <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> is then rotated until a single light beam passes through two points on <b>the</b> <b>instrument.</b> This fixes <b>the</b> orientation of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> in all three axes.|$|R
5|$|Details of {{the modern}} climate record are known through the taking of {{measurements}} from such weather instruments as thermometers, barometers, and anemometers {{during the past few}} centuries. <b>The</b> <b>instruments</b> used to study weather over the modern time scale, their known error, their immediate environment, and their exposure have changed over the years, which must be considered when studying the climate of centuries past.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{performances}} can {{be classified}} as either formal ones or informal. During formal performances adherents follow a traditional set of rules that would govern playing and it usually involved people from outside the home. Informal performances are quite the opposite. The strict rules that normally govern play are often ignored and the performers are usually between people well acquainted with one another, usually close family members. These performances usually were times when amateurs practiced on <b>the</b> <b>instruments,</b> young boys and girls gathered <b>the</b> <b>instruments,</b> substituting the kulintang with the saronay and inubab. Ensembles didn’t necessary have to have five instruments like formal performances: they could be composed of only four instruments (three gandingan gongs, a kulintang, an agung, and a dabakan), three instruments (a kulintang, a dabakan, and either an agung or three gandingan gongs) or simply just one instrument (kulintang solo).|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Rhodes {{was sold}} to CBS boss William Schultz, who closed down the main factory in 1985 and {{subsequently}} sold the business to Roland in 1987. Roland manufactured digital pianos under the Rhodes name, but Harold Rhodes disapproved of <b>the</b> <b>instruments,</b> which were made without his consultation or endorsement.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} an instrument {{designed as a}} profile of teacher achievement and teacher needs {{with respect to the}} probability and statistics strands in the mathematics curriculum. In developing <b>the</b> profiling <b>instrument,</b> I had two primary objectives. First, <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> was to assist in the assessment of teacher achievement {{in the context of the}} adoption of professional standards for mathematics teachers. Second, <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> was to assess professional development needs for teachers in the light of changes to the mathematics curriculum. The background for the development of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> is presented, followed by a description of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> and <b>the</b> results of responses to <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> from 43 Australian teachers.
