5|$|Magnetic brakes {{were first}} used on Nitro at Six Flags Great Adventure in 2001. Magnetic brakes slow down trains {{much faster than}} {{friction}} brakes; most B roller coasters built in or after 2001 {{have at least one}} set of magnetic brakes. Magnetic brakes do not make contact with the train. Fins that run parallel to the train are fitted beneath the seats. As the fins pass through <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> the magnetic field created by <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> slows the train. Magnetic brakes have also been used as an alternate type of trim brake on B roller coasters such as Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland.|$|E
5|$|When B {{was first}} founded, the linear {{magnetic}} eddy brake {{had yet to}} be developed, so it used friction brakes as its main braking system. On the train, pads are fitted beneath the seating areas. On <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> similar pads are connected to steel supports. When the pads on the train come into contact with <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> friction is created which slows the train. Beginning with Kumba in 1993, friction brakes have also been used as trim brakes that regulate the speed of the train while it is still navigating the course.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} is presented {{a kind of}} cooling device for a vehicle’s brake cooling system, which comprises a thermoelectric cooling (TEC) chip and a heat exchange system. The disc-brake and drum-brake systems {{are discussed in the}} research. After inputting electric power, the TEC chip provides one cooling surface which is stick on <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> system and absorbs the heat from <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pads or shoes. The other surface releases heat which is absorbed by a recycle water-cooling system to discharge the heat by water-cooled radiator to the surrounding. It decreased the working temperature of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> system about 30 % at most after using this cooling device and increased <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> force about 30 % at least. There is a temperature control device for the device which can start the TEC chip when the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pads or shoes exceeded 50 ℃, which is the lowest temperature that <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pads or shoes can maintain the most performance of <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> force. <b>The</b> device can efficiently keep <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> force when <b>the</b> driver uses <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> to reduce <b>the</b> vehicle’s speed {{for a long time and}} provide the safety for the driver. Introduction and Literature Review <b>The</b> <b>braking</b> system is one of the important kinetic control systems in the vehicle[1]. By transferring kinetic energy to friction work[2], <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> force can decelerate the speed of the vehicle...|$|R

5|$|Caracciola {{returned}} to racing in 1952, {{when he was}} recalled to the Mercedes-Benz factory team to drive the new Mercedes-Benz W194 in sports car races. The first major race with the car was the Mille Miglia, alongside Karl Kling and his old teammate Hermann Lang. Kling {{finished second in the}} race, Caracciola fourth. It later emerged that Caracciola had been given a car with an inferior engine to his teammates, perhaps {{because of a lack of}} time to prepare for the race. Caracciola's career ended with his third major crash; during a support race for the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix, <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> on his 300SL locked and he skidded into a tree, fracturing his left leg.|$|E
50|$|Adjustment of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> is {{done through}} the {{adjuster}} (6) which basically is a screw {{that can be}} accessed when <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> is assembled. <b>The</b> adjustment is necessary {{to make sure that}} <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> is working as expected and not applying brake force when not expected by having too tight margins while still retaining a good responsiveness from <b>the</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Response to the driver’s {{operation}} of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> valve was inconsistent and not self-lapping (that is, {{the position of}} <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> control valve set {{the rate of change}} of <b>brake</b> force, not <b>the</b> level of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> force).|$|R
5000|$|Various brake designs such as band {{brakes and}} many drum brakes are self-assisting: when <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> is applied, some of <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> force feeds back into <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> {{mechanism}} to further self-apply <b>the</b> <b>brake.</b> This is called [...] "positive feedback" [...] or [...] "self-servo". Self-assist reduces the input force needed to apply <b>the</b> <b>brake,</b> but exaggerates fade, since {{a reduction in}} pad friction material height or thickness also reduces pad force. In contrast, for a brake without self-assist, such as a conventional disc brake, a loss of pad friction material {{does not change the}} pad force, so there is no necessary loss in <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> torque reaction for a given amount of input force.|$|R
5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} motionless, a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, the rider can keep {{the line between the}} two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to {{one side or the other}} and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch from side to side as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> are momentarily engaged.|$|E
5|$|Powered winches {{were used}} on cargo ships {{to speed the}} {{handling}} of heavy loads. One winch was operated {{at each of the}} ship's five cargo holds. During loading operations, the winches were worked hard, requiring steady maintenance to remain operable. Winch brakesa safety feature provided for stopping the load from falling if the winch's main power was lostwere not often used by a skilled winch operator, as the load could be more quickly maneuvered using various power settings than by application of <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> Disused brakes sometimes seized up and stopped working. The winches on the SS E. A. Bryan were steam-powered and showed signs of wear, even though the ship was only five months old.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for the Di6 called for the first delivery in February 1995. Several components were to be manufactured by NSB, including the fuel tanks, sandboxes, engine frames, alternators and some components for the bogies. The first locomotive was delivered on 7 March 1996, but quickly proved to not meet the specifications in the contract. In particular, the locomotives had too high fuel consumption and the bogies had faults, as they had too high track forces. Both of these issues were difficult to solve. The Di6 also had problems with overheating, in particular in the main alternators, the oil cooler and <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> The on-board computer failed when the outdoor temperature fell too low.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new braking torque {{distribution}} strategy for electric {{vehicles equipped with}} a hybrid hydraulic braking and regenerative <b>braking</b> system. <b>The</b> <b>braking</b> torque distribution strategy is proposed based on <b>the</b> required <b>braking</b> torque and <b>the</b> regenerative <b>braking</b> system 2 ̆ 7 s status. To get <b>the</b> required <b>braking</b> torque, a new strategy is designed based on the road conditions and driver 2 ̆ 7 s <b>braking</b> intentions. Through <b>the</b> estimated road surface, a robust wheel slip controller is designed to calculate <b>the</b> overall maximum <b>braking</b> torque required for <b>the</b> anti-lock <b>braking</b> system (ABS) under this road condition. Driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions are classified as <b>the</b> emergency <b>braking</b> and <b>the</b> normal <b>braking.</b> In <b>the</b> case of emergency <b>braking,</b> <b>the</b> required <b>braking</b> torque is to be equal to <b>the</b> overall maximum <b>braking</b> torque. In <b>the</b> case of normal <b>braking,</b> <b>the</b> command <b>braking</b> torque {{is proportional to the}} pedal stroke. Then <b>the</b> required <b>braking</b> torque is chosen as the smaller one between <b>the</b> overall maximum <b>braking</b> torque and <b>the</b> command <b>braking</b> torque. To acquire both high regenerative efficiency and good <b>braking</b> performance when <b>the</b> required <b>braking</b> torque is smaller than <b>the</b> maximum <b>braking</b> torque of <b>the</b> regenerative <b>braking</b> system, <b>the</b> whole <b>braking</b> torque can be provided by <b>the</b> regenerative <b>braking</b> system; when <b>the</b> required <b>braking</b> torque is bigger than <b>the</b> maximum <b>braking</b> torque of <b>the</b> regenerative <b>braking</b> system, <b>the</b> whole <b>braking</b> torque can be provided by both <b>the</b> hydraulic <b>braking</b> system and <b>the</b> regenerative <b>braking</b> system, while <b>the</b> maximum <b>braking</b> torque of <b>the</b> regenerative <b>braking</b> system is obtained based on the battery state of charge (SOC) and vehicle speed in real-time. Both fuzzy rule-based scheduling and robust control approaches will be applied to achieve the above proposed distribution strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is validated by numerical simulations under various road conditions, vehicle speeds, driver 2 ̆ 7 s <b>braking</b> intentions, and <b>the</b> battery SOCs...|$|R
5000|$|To release <b>brakes,</b> <b>the</b> driver {{makes the}} {{pressure}} rise in <b>the</b> , via <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> controller; <b>the</b> pressure in <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pipe is restored (air {{is taken from}} the main reservoir tanks, and from the main pipe if present) to the value present in the [...]Inside <b>the</b> [...] <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pipe pressure wins over the command reservoir pressure and so the connection between <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> cylinders and <b>the</b> auxiliary tanks is modified (or cut, depending on the pipe pressure); <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> cylinders unload themselves sending their air outside until their pressure reaches a value proportional to the entity of the depression.When pipe pressure is , the cylinders will unload until they are empty.|$|R
40|$|Vacuum brakes {{are first}} used {{in place of}} <b>the</b> air <b>brake</b> in railway locomotives.

When <b>the</b> vacuum-powered <b>brake</b> booster in a passenger vehicle becomes disabled, <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> force gain {{of the system is}} reduced significantly, and <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pedal force required locking the tires increases beyond the ability of some adults...|$|R
5|$|The problem {{occurred}} {{because of the}} way the vehicles were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed that although the brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side. This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the front passenger and driver could activate <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
5|$|Two {{distinct}} functions – {{first that}} of traction by adhesion as in an ordinary loco; second that of traction by pinions {{acting on the}} track bars. <b>The</b> <b>brakes</b> are four in number – two handbrakes, acting by friction; and two acting by preventing the free escape of air from cylinder and thus using compressed air in retarding {{the progress of the}} engine. The former are used for shunting whilst the later for descending steep gradients. One of the handbrakes acts on the tyres of the wheels in the ordinary manner and the second acts on grooved surfaces of the pinion axle, but can be used in those places where the rack is laid.|$|E

5|$|During 1997, {{there were}} five {{incidents}} where NSB's Nordic Mobile Telephone equipment interfered with the locomotive's electronics, causing the emergency brakes to activate. This caused a temporary halt until the motorman had unlocked <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> The problem was fixed by moving NSB's mobile senders. The units were taken into use on the Bergen Line from 5 January 1997. Later they entered into use on the Dovre and Sørland Lines, and then on regional trains around Oslo, such as the Vestfold Line. In August 1998, NSB stated that El 18 used more power {{than some of the}} substation transformers along the line could handle, particularly along the Vestfold Line. Part of the problem was caused by a mechanism in the locomotives whereby the motor was turned off if the wheels spin. The result was that the full power output of the El 18 along parts of the railway network could not be utilized.|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, the Accident Investigation Board Norway {{criticized the}} braking system of the trains. During 2009, there were 83 {{incidents}} where trains with locked wheels slid down steep sections of track. The Accident Investigation Board found that the metro had conducted insufficient testing of {{the braking system}} on steep slippery lines, had not adjusted <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> satisfactorily, and had not maintained the trains and tracks sufficiently. In December 2010, Oslo Vognselskap ordered another 32 three-car units, bringing the total order up to 115 three-car units. The last trains will be delivered in 2012. There was political disagreement regarding the final purchase, with the Liberal Party and socialist opposition securing a majority for the purchase, while the right-winged parties voted to order 19 units. The extra trains {{will make it possible}} to run all lines except the Holmenkollen Line (Line 1) with six-car lines, compared to a situation with only three-car trains on the Lambertseter Line, the Ring Line and the Kolsås Line (lines 4 and 6) would only use three-car trains.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>brake</b> of winch is {{to prevent}} the {{occurrence}} of reverse slipping at working time.
