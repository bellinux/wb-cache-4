5|$|Although the DPP {{passed a}} {{resolution}} to ban all factions within the party in 2006, <b>the</b> <b>dissent</b> between former members of different factions was still present and {{was thought to be}} one of the factors that led to DPP's loss in the presidential election.

5|$|Aware of the {{inadequacy}} of bureaucracy in Austria, and wishing to improve it, Maria Theresa reformed education in 1775. In a new school system based on the Prussian one, all children of both genders from the ages of six to twelve were required to attend school. Education reform was met with hostility from many villages; Maria Theresa crushed <b>the</b> <b>dissent</b> by ordering the arrest of all those opposed. Although the idea had merit, the reforms were not as successful as {{they were expected to}} be since no funding was offered from the state; in some parts of Austria, half of the population was illiterate well into the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|One {{definition}} of a sub-brown dwarf is a planet-mass object that formed through cloud collapse rather than accretion. This formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon; astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet {{as part of its}} division in classification. One reason for <b>the</b> <b>dissent</b> is that often it may not be possible to determine the formation process. For example, a planet formed by accretion around a star may get ejected from the system to become free-floating, and likewise a sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star.|$|E

5|$|Taylor was {{the first}} Compulsory Process Clause case since Washington v. Texas to provide a {{specific}} limitation {{on the right of}} defendants to force their witnesses to testify. In that case, the Court construed a defendant's right very broadly in his ability to present a defense. Here, however, the Court restricted that ability to comply with court rules, especially if those rules were of equal consequence upon both the prosecution and the defense. This decision was reached over <b>the</b> <b>dissent</b> of three Justices, all of whom felt a defendant's case should not be limited based on an error solely by the defendant's attorney to list appropriate witnesses.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{never took}} place. Instead, the fighter force {{was committed to}} the disastrous Operation Bodenplatte, designed to support German forces during the Battle of the Bulge. Galland's influence on matters was now virtually nil. Appalled by the Ardennes losses, he personally confronted Gollob and criticised him severely. Gollob contacted the Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Himmler's reputation {{as the most powerful}} man after Hitler at that time may have been a prime motive. Gollob complained about his misuse in the Luftwaffe and Galland's leadership. The SS had already spread their influence into other areas of military affairs including the V-2 operations. Himmler, whose relationship with Göring was poor, took the opportunity to exploit <b>the</b> <b>dissent</b> in the Luftwaffe and undermine the Reichsmarschall by supporting Gollob. It was also an opportunity for the SS to seize control of the Luftwaffe and for Himmler to oust Göring from power. Göring, for his part offered no support to Galland when Himmler or the SS were mentioned. On 13 January 1945, Galland was finally relieved of his command.|$|E
5|$|In 324BC Harpalus, to whom Alexander had {{entrusted}} huge treasures, absconded {{and sought}} refuge in Athens. The Assembly had initially {{refused to accept}} him, following Demosthenes's advice, but finally Harpalus entered Athens. He was imprisoned after a proposal of Demosthenes and Phocion, despite <b>the</b> <b>dissent</b> of Hypereides, an anti-Macedonian statesman and former ally of Demosthenes. Additionally, the ecclesia decided {{to take control of}} Harpalus's money, which was entrusted to a committee presided over by Demosthenes. When the committee counted the treasure, they found they only had half the money Harpalus had declared he possessed. Nevertheless, they decided not to disclose the deficit. When Harpalus escaped, the Areopagus conducted an inquiry and charged Demosthenes with mishandling twenty talents. During the trial, Hypereides argued that Demosthenes did not disclose the huge deficit, because he was bribed by Harpalus. Demosthenes was fined and imprisoned, but he soon escaped.* I. Apostolidis, notes 1219, 1226 & 1229 in J. G. Droysen, History of Alexander the Great, 717–726; K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 303–309; D. Whitehead, Hypereides, 359–360; I. Worthington, Harpalus Affair, passim. It remains unclear whether the accusations against him were just or not. In any case, the Athenians soon repealed the sentence.* K.
