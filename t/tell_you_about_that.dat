2500|$|Often the {{minister}} reads passages from well-known historical, sociological, or anthropological works, and finds in them inconspicuous {{references to the}} Blackman’s true history in the world.... Occasionally {{the minister}} chides the audience for its scepticism: “I know you don't believe me because I {{happen to be a}} Black man. Well, you can look it up in a book I’m going to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> was written by a white man.” He then reads off references that his hearers are challenged to check for themselves. A single documented statement, however, may become the basis {{of a wide range of}} generalized non-sequiturs. The fact that a North Carolina slaveholder had an Arabic-speaking Muslim slave of unusual mathematical ability may be offered as evidence that all slaves brought to America were Moslem, Arabic-speaking, and learned. Similarly, historical facts may be indiscriminately mingled with myths and countermyths. (The Black Muslims in America, pp. 120–121) ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, cook, {{there is}} no chance. I forgot to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> little matter. The boy was here {{yesterday}} and he refused--absolutely declined a splendid offer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{remember}} my <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> fellow {{who looks like}} me--the fellow named Dave Porter?" [...] went on the former moving-picture actor. [...] "Well, he's here in this hotel. And he and three of his chums have the rooms next to this one." ...|$|R
5000|$|Let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> night (Transit Lounge, 2009 | Ethos Books, 2012) ...|$|R
60|$|The next {{question}} is, {{what is the}} best time for seeing Fairies? I believe I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{rather not}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> part of it, aunt Dorcas; but I didn't do {{anything}} that wasn't jest straight, though all of 'em believe I did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "’Ah, yes,’ ses Smith, {{looking as}} though ’e’d just remembered something. ’I wanted to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> {{to see if}} I’ve done right. I’m glad you’ve come in.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Awfully. But {{the point}} is that now he's gone I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> M.C.C. match affair. I know you want to hear what really did happen that afternoon.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> night {{listed by}} The Straits Times {{as among the}} best 5 books of the year (2009) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no {{easy thing}} to climb, and the person doesn't live that can climb it at night. We {{had to take the}} {{daylight}} to it, and didn't reach the top till after sunset. Why, I could take hours and hours <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> last climb, which I won't. The top was flat as a billiard table, about a quarter of an acre in size, and was almost clean of snow. Vahna told me that the great winds that usually blew, kept the snow off of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "D'you {{remember}} my <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> chap I met in Brittany? I saw him {{the other day}} here. He's just off to Tahiti. He was broke to the world. He was a brasseur d'affaires, a stockbroker I suppose you call it in English; {{and he had a}} wife and family, and he was earning a large income. He chucked it all to become a painter. He just went off and settled down in Brittany and began to paint. He hadn't got any money and did {{the next best thing to}} starving." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] the man continued, [...] "you look straight--and I've got to {{take some}} chances. It's my last stake. We'll get down to business. I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> spruce." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{a curious}} way," [...] Babbie answered, shortly, [...] "but I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> just now. Would {{you like to}} hear all about me?" [...] Suddenly {{she seemed to have}} become confidential.|$|E
6000|$|... "Todd and {{the others}} can readily <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> and about Merwell's cattle, too. But come, we have wasted too much time already. You'll all be wanting supper long before we reach the ranch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and--and--but I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> too presently. It {{is enough}} to say that he is alive and well--sickness almost, if not quite, gone. I was so sorry for him." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Did I Ever <b>Tell</b> <b>You</b> <b>About</b> the Man <b>That</b> Taught His Asshole to Talk?" [...] (6:18) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{some other}} time," [...] said Sam. [...] "Just {{for the moment}} I want to sit quite still and think. Are you comfortable? Fine! Then off we go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The point is," [...] I continued, [...] "not {{having seen}} {{you with your}} clothes off, {{nevertheless}} I am able to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> scar above your right elbow, and that scar on your right ankle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I get so many interruptions," [...] he said, almost grinning. [...] "You must {{excuse me}} a minute! Then--then I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> fellow. But don't go. I pray you don't go. I can assure you. [...] . MOST interesting." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then MacShaughnassy gave way. [...] "Talking of plots," [...] he said, {{hitching}} {{his chair}} a little nearer the table, [...] "that puts me in mind. Did I ever <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> dog we had when {{we lived in}} Norwood?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> if you'll {{allow me}} to send into Penzance for my things. I cannot discuss matters with you if you {{proclaim}} yourself to be my enemy. You say we are both idiots." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{going into}} the Church under the circumstances? That depends on your conscience, Fred--how far you have counted the cost, and seen what your {{position}} will require of you. I can only <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> myself, <b>that</b> I have always been too lax, and have been uneasy in consequence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{down by the}} Tugela there, in a bad way. However, he can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> himself, for I {{have brought}} him with me {{to show us the}} path to Dingaan's kraal. Where is Pereira? Send Pereira here. I want to speak with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Vane had {{reasons for}} believing {{that this was}} not an {{uncommon}} experience; but the man went on again: [...] "Well, you look straight, and I've got to take some chances; it's my last stake. We'll get down to business; I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> spruce." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> to-morrow," [...] Evelyn {{answered}} with a blush. [...] "You must lie still {{and go to sleep}} again if you can, but if you give trouble, we'll leave the señora Rocas, who is deaf and very clumsy, to look after you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, the car?" [...] said Ralph Bingham. [...] "That's all right. Didn't I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> I {{bought it}} just now and engaged the driver as my chauffeur, I've {{been meaning to}} buy a car for a long time. A man ought to have a car." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> better <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{when we are}} on our way home, Dave. I {{certainly}} saw the hoof-prints down by {{the salt}} lick this morning. That proves they can't be far off. My idea is that at least three deer are just beyond the lower creek, although I may be mistaken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jill Mariner, you know. You {{remember}} Jill? You haven't forgotten my <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> all <b>that?</b> <b>About</b> her {{losing her}} money and {{coming over to}} America?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Tottie dear," [...] said Mrs Bones firmly, [...] "when I heard <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Rosebud Cottage, an' the {{treasure}} Miss Stiffinthegills--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> sir," [...] said he, {{resting his}} foot on the chair next to mine.

6000|$|... "We {{came to see}} {{you about}} a man who called to see you last night, a Mr. Job Haskers," [...] said Dave, after a pause, during which the {{visitors}} seated themselves. [...] "Perhaps it is none of our business, Mr. Fordham, but my chums and I here felt it our duty to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did Jerry Mitchell ever <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{friend of}} his who keeps a dogs' {{hospital}} down on Long Island somewhere? I forget his name. Smithers or Smethurst or something. People--old ladies, you know, and people--bring him their dogs to be cured when they get sick. He has an infallible remedy, Jerry tells me. He {{makes a lot of}} money at it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{want to talk}} of them to you! I {{wanted to}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> myself <b>that</b> day we rode up to the mine--but I could not." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Upon my word, I don't know. Bell can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> better <b>about</b> <b>that</b> than I, as Dr Crofts settled it. I suppose Dr Crofts {{tells her}} everything."
