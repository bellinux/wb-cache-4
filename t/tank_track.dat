50|$|The {{cemetery}} {{was established}} in 1863 {{as a place to}} inter the remains of American Civil War Union army soldiers. Its initial placement interfered with expansion of the Arsenal's facilities, so it was moved to a location on the northern end of the island. Civil War veterans who were interred in Oakdale Cemetery in Davenport, Iowa, were later disinterred and moved to the National Cemetery. Property transfers from the Arsenal in 1926, 1936, and 1950 increased the cemetery's area. There are plans for further expansion of this cemetery including an addition pavilion, more land, and a wall for cremations near the <b>tank</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Private Linthwaite {{designed}} a patch which was 4” round {{and had a}} solid yellow-gold background to symbolize the Cavalry heritage. On {{the face of the}} patch he drew a stylized black <b>tank</b> <b>track</b> with drive and idler sprockets to symbolize mobility. In the center of the track at a slight diagonal, he placed a single cannon barrel, also in black, to symbolize fire power. Finally, to symbolize the striking power of the new armored force, he added a diagonal lightning bolt in red, extending across the total design and full diameter of the patch. Private Linthwaite won his pass. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Armor_Force_Patch_1933.jpg ...|$|E

50|$|A month later, on 17-18 November, the Soviet forces {{captured}} {{the town of}} Novoye Selo {{in the region of}} Vitebsk during a night battle. During this attack, Mariya further improved her reputation as a skilled tank driver. On the 17th, Mariya began to assault the German positions near Noveoye Selo. However, a German artillery shell exploded into her tank's tracks, halting her advance. Mariya and a fellow crewman jumped out to repair the track, while their fellow crew members gave the covering fire from the tank's turret. After a while, they fixed the <b>tank</b> <b>track,</b> and her tank rejoined the main unit several days later.|$|E
5000|$|... (The Carden Lloyd type Horstmann {{suspension}} components {{employed by}} the Panzer I was practically identical to the light <b>tank</b> <b>track</b> system used on the Universal Carrier, with the Maultier's use of them closely resembling the roadwheel/suspension system used by the T16 American-produced version in its roadwheel design. Following the fall of Singapore rubber was scarce and so a Bedford QL was similarly adapted using a Carden Lloyd suspension. While the Bedford Bren gave impressive traction and excellent cross-country performance the higher cost {{and the effect of}} detail improvements in automotive design and materials such as artificial rubber meant this parallel British conversion never progressed beyond a single prototype, later converted back into an all-wheel vehicle.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Vehicle armour is {{sometimes}} improvised {{in the midst}} of an armed conflict by vehicle crews or individual units. In World War II, British, Canadian and Polish tank crews welded spare strips of <b>tank</b> <b>track</b> to the hulls of their Sherman tanks. U.S. tank crews often added sand bags in the hull and turrets on Sherman tanks, often in an elaborate cage made of girders. Some Sherman tanks were up-armoured in the field with glacis plates and other armour cut from knocked-out tanks to create Improvised Jumbos, named after the heavily armoured M4A3E2 assault tank. In the Vietnam War, U.S. [...] "gun trucks" [...] were armoured with sandbags and locally fabricated steel armour plate. More recently, U.S. troops in Iraq armoured Humvees and various military transport vehicles with scrap materials: this came to be known as [...] "hillbilly armor" [...] or [...] "haji armor" [...] by the Americans.|$|E

50|$|The early {{tanks were}} {{mechanically}} rudimentary. The 0.23 to 0.47 in thick armor generally prevented penetration by small arms fire and shell fragments. However, even a near miss from field artillery or an impact from a mortar HE round easily disabled the tank, or destroyed {{it if the}} fuel tank was ruptured, incinerating the tank's crew. A large caliber gun was recognized as a tactical necessity to attack machine gun positions and defeat any infantry field pieces found in the trench lines which could easily disable <b>tank</b> <b>track</b> with the HE ammunition. This was achieved by mounting a QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss light 57 mm naval gun mounted in the hull barbettes. Hull and track engineering was largely dictated by the terrain—the need to cross wide trenches—although the relationship between ground pressure and soil-vehicle mechanics was not resolved until the Second World War. Turrets were later introduced on medium and light tanks to react to ambushes during the advance.|$|E
5000|$|We {{made use}} of [...] "petrol bombs" [...] roughly as follows: take a 2lb glass jam jar. Fill with petrol. Take a heavy curtain, half a blanket, or some other heavy {{material}}. Wrap this over {{the mouth of the}} jar, tie it round the neck with string, leave the ends of the material hanging free. When you want to use it have somebody standing by with a light a source of ignition. Put a corner of the material down in front of you, turn the bottle over so that petrol soaks out round the mouth of the bottle and drips on to this corner of the material. Turn the bottle right way up again, hold it in your right hand, most of the blanket bunched beneath the bottle, with your left hand take the blanket near the corner that is wetted with petrol. Wait for your tank. When near enough, your pal comrade-in-arms lights the petrol soaked corner of the blanket. Throw the bottle and blanket as soon as this corner is flaring. (You cannot throw it far.) See that it drops in front of the tank. The blanket should catch in the tracks or in a cog-wheel, or wind itself round an axle. The bottle will smash, but the petrol should soak the blanket well enough to make a really healthy fire which will burn the rubber wheels on which the <b>tank</b> <b>track</b> runs, set fire to the carburetor or frizzle the crew. Do not play with these things. They are highly dangerous.|$|E
