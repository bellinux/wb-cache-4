A typical waveplate is simply a birefringent crystal with a carefully chosen orientation and thickness. The crystal is cut into a plate, with {{the orientation of the}} cut chosen so that the optic axis of the crystal is parallel to the surfaces of the plate. This results in two axes in the plane of the cut: the ordinary axis, with index of refraction no, and the extraordinary axis, with index of refraction ne. The ordinary axis is perpendicular to the optic axis. The extraordinary axis is parallel to the optic axis. For a light wave normally incident upon the plate, polarization component along the ordinary <b>axis</b> <b>travels</b> through the crystal with a speed vo = c/no, while the polarization component along the extraordinary <b>axis</b> <b>travels</b> with a speed ve = c/ne.

Although most electrons pass through the beam unperturbed, some are scattered by the atomic and molecular electrostatic potentials. If the molecules in the molecular beam are randomly oriented, and the electron beam is judged to be collimated, the electrons scatter in a radial symmetric pattern about z. The resulting patterns may then be described by an intensity measure at an angle θ from the center position. Typically, these scattering intensity features are expressed in terms of the momentum transfer parameter, s, the magnitude of the change in the momentum vectors between the incident and scattered electron. For elastic scattering, the s value (with units of Å- 1) at each point from the center position is given by s = k 0 2 k 0 − k sin (θ 2...|$|R

Instantaneous level of received power fluctuates {{as a result of}} small-scale fading effects due to multipath propagation in underwater environments. In shallow water, multipath occurs due to signal reflections from the surface, bottom and any objects in the water. In deep water, the multi path phenomenon occurs due to ray bending, i.e., the tendency of acoustic waves to <b>travel</b> along the <b>axis</b> of lowest sound speed. Even though, there is no general consensus on an appropriate statistical model for received signal amplitude in underwater acoustic channels, the small-scale fading effects are often modeled as Rayleigh or Rician fading [41 – 43] while some studies suggest K-distribution [44] or Weibull distribution [45]. In [46], Urick proposes Rician model to describe the amplitude fluctuations in ocean environment. In [47], Bjerrum -Niese et al. propose a turbulent shallow water channel model that follows Rician distribution.

Based on the conservation of magnetic flux, the magnetic field changes along the axis of the hourglass. We adopt the result of TG 08 [...] -the high-energy emission from GeV to TeV can be produced through inverse Compton by the two-zone system, and the photons from radio to X-ray are mainly radiated by the fast inner zone system. Here, we only discuss the light curves of the fast inner blob from radio to X-ray. When a compressible blob <b>travels</b> down the <b>axis</b> of the first bulb in the hourglass, because of magnetic flux conservation, its cross section experiences an adiabatic compression process, which results in particle acceleration and the brightening of HST- 1. When the blob moves into the second bulb of the hourglass, because of magnetic flux conservation, the dimming of the knot occurs along with an adiabatic expansion of its cross section. A similar broken exponential function could fit the TeV peaks in M 87, which may imply a correlation between the TeV flares of M 87 and the light curves from radio to X-ray in HST- 1.

Refractive optics can be combined with diffractive microstructures to hybrid lenses, which can be produced cost-effective by ultra precision machining using diamond cutting tools.

30|$|Intermodal {{dispersion}} (also called modal dispersion) is {{the phenomenon}} {{that the group}} velocity of light propagating in a multimode fiber (or other waveguide) depends {{not only on the}} optical frequency (chromatic dispersion) but also on the propagation mode involved. The strength of intermodal dispersion can be quantified as the differential mode delay (DMD). It depends strongly on the refractive index profile of the fiber in and around the fiber core. For example, for a step-index profile the higher-order modes have lower group velocities, and this can lead to differential group delays of the order of 10 ps/m = 10 ns/km. It is then hardly possible to realize data rates of multiple Gbit/s in an fiber-optic link with a kilometer length. In systems for optical fiber communications based on multimode fibers, intermodal dispersion can severely limit the achievable data transmission rate (bit rate). In order to avoid strong signal distortion, it is usually necessary to keep the pulses long enough to maintain a reasonable temporal overlap of components from different modes, and this unavoidably sets a limit on the data rate. The natural way of eliminating intermodal dispersion is to use fiber links based on single-mode fibers, but intermodal dispersion can also be minimized by using multimode fibers with a parabolic refractive index profile, where intermodal dispersion is minimized. In case of graded index fiber, critical angle condition is satisfied at different distances from the axis of the core for different modes as refractive index is decreasing from the axis up to core cladding interface. The wave which is internally reflected near <b>axis</b> <b>travel</b> less distance but will also have low velocity due to higher refractive index. On the other hand, wave reflected near the interface will travel more distance but with higher velocity due to smaller refractive index. Hence, the time to reach the other end will be same for these waves which means no intermodal dispersion.|$|R
40|$|The L- 3 Communications Model 999 H traveling-wave tube (TWT) {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to generate an output power of 144 W at 60 -percent overall efficiency in continuous-wave operation over the frequency band from 31. 8 to 32. 3 GHz. The best TWT heretofore commercially available for operation in the affected frequency band is characterized by an output power of only 35 W and an efficiency of 50 percent. Moreover, whereas prior TWTs are limited to single output power levels, {{it has been shown}} that the output power of the Model 999 H can be varied from 54 to 144 W. A TWT is a vacuum electronic device used to amplify microwave signals. TWTs are typically used in free-space communication systems because they are capable of operating at power and efficiency levels significantly higher than those of solid-state devices. In a TWT, an electron beam is generated by an electron gun consisting of a cathode, focusing electrodes, and an anode. The electrons pass through a hole in the anode and are focused into a cylindrical beam by a stack of periodic permanent magnets and <b>travel</b> along the <b>axis</b> of an electrically conductive helix, along which propagates an electromagnetic wave that has been launched by an input signal that is to be amplified. The beam travels within the helix at a velocity close to the phase velocity of the electromagnetic wave. The electromagnetic field decelerates some of the electrons and accelerates others, causing the beam to become formed into electron bunches, which further interact with the electromagnetic wave in such a manner as to surrender kinetic energy to the wave, thereby amplifying the wave. The net result is to amplify the input signal by a factor of about 100, 000. After the electrons have passed along the helix, they impinge on electrodes in a collector. The collector decelerates the electrons in such a manner as to recover most of the remaining kinetic energy and thereby significantly increase the power efficiency of the TWT...|$|R
