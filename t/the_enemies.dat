Each level contains many identical groups of enemies, making these games notable for their repetition. In beat 'em up games, players often fight a boss—an enemy much stronger than the other enemies—at {{the end of each}} level.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the corners}} of the maze are four larger, {{flashing}} consumables known as Power Pills that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts and earn bonus points. When a Power Pill is in effect <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> turn blue and try to evade Pac-Man. When a ghost is eaten its disembodied eyes return to the nest (center box) to respawn. The blue ghosts turn reddish during the last moments of a Power Pill’s effect, signaling that they are about to become dangerous again, and the length of time for which <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> remain vulnerable varies from one level to the next, becoming shorter as the game progresses. The final consumable items are the Vitamins, which appear periodically directly below the nest.|$|E

5000|$|A counterattack is a {{military}} tactic that occurs when one side successfully defends off <b>the</b> <b>enemy’s</b> attack and begins to push <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> back with an attack of its own. In order to perform a successful counterattack, the defending side must quickly and decisively strike <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> after defending, {{with the objective of}} shocking and overwhelming <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> <b>The</b> main concept of the counterattack is to catch <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> by surprise. Many historical counterattacks were successful {{due to the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> was off guard and not expecting the counterattack.|$|R

50|$|The nationalists {{had lost}} three {{divisions}} to enemy by October, 1946 in northeast China, {{and the local}} nationalist commander, Du Yuming adjusted the strategy by planning to eradicate <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> in a gradual but firm manner, instead of attempting to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> rapidly by a decisive engagement, which <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> had refused to do. The heart of this new strategy called {{for the elimination of}} <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> base south of Songhua River, headquartered at Linjiang. After <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> had been eradicated in the south, then the nationalists would push northward across the Songhua River and eliminate <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> there.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-Republican army, {{the central}} tactic {{was a shock}} infantry-charge, {{designed}} to put <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> to flight as quickly as possible. Hastati legionaries would advance at a measured pace towards <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> line. When <b>the</b> gap was only around 15m, each successive line of hastati would fling their two pila, draw their swords and break into a run, yelling their war-cry and charging into <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> line. Smashing <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> in <b>the</b> face with their shield-bosses, legionaries would use their gladii to stab <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> in <b>the</b> groin, belly, or face, inflicting fatal wounds in {{the great majority of}} cases. Where <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> was tribal and unarmoured, the initial impact alone frequently resulted in the collapse of <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> line. Against advanced <b>enemies</b> such as <b>the</b> Greeks, the initial impact would at least disrupt <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> line and, in the ensuing melee, the Romans would benefit from their improved weaponry.|$|R

However, every four levels, the rocket resets (giving the player an extra life) and the replacement {{has to be}} built {{before it can be}} re-fuelled for take off. Each new model has a new design with a higher number written on it, although the gameplay remains unchanged. <b>The</b> <b>enemies</b> change forms each level (cycling back to the first after eight levels) and each alien has a different pattern of movement which means they can be dealt with in a different manner.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Musidora was exhibited, Etty's health was in serious decline. Suffering severe asthma, {{it was not}} unusual for passers-by to accuse him of {{drunkenness}} {{as he made his way}} wheezing through the London streets, and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. Abandoning the smaller paintings which kept him profitable, he strived to complete his Joan of Arc triptych before his health gave out. This was on a huge scale, 28ft (8.5m) in total width and 9ft 9in (3m) high; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> of France, and Joan dying a martyr.|$|E

This tactic {{is an extension of}} the [...] "Make a sound in the east, then strike in the west" [...] tactic. But instead of simply spreading misinformation to draw <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> attention, physical baits are used to increase <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> certainty on <b>the</b> misinformation. These baits must be easily seen by <b>the</b> <b>enemy,</b> to ensure that they draw <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> attention.

40|$|This project {{involves}} a sustained {{investigation into the}} sense of <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> Chapter one begins by focusing on a common understanding of <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> found within our homeworld: <b>the</b> political <b>enemy.</b> As will become clear, this mode of encountering <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> has become <b>the</b> dominant framework for understanding <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> in our liberal-democratic home. Our task {{at this point is}} to identify the political elements from which our mode of understanding <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> emerges. Once this dominant understanding has been developed, I will treat it as a clue for a fuller investigation into the sense of <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> In chapter two, we see that even positions critical of liberal-democratic thought tend to occupy a similar political understanding of <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> Working with <b>the</b> writings of Carl Schmitt, we observe how even his critical posture towards the liberal-democratic understanding of <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> is itself operating within a similar articulation of <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> I argue that Schmitt 2 ̆ 7 s articulation is similar to the liberal-democratic articulation in that they are both modern in nature. The task of the third chapter is to understand the problematic aspects of the modern understanding of our world so as to clear the way for a fuller understanding of <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> This is followed by the fourth chapter that is devoted to finding a way to think outside of the modern liberal-democratic model of politics that regulates our homeworld understanding of <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> In so doing, chapters three and four help us find an opening into a more essential structure organizing the sense of <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> Once this goal is accomplished, the final chapter investigates the way we encounter <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> within generative and intersubjective lived experience...|$|R
5|$|Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, {{agreed to}} an {{audience}} with the Electress Palatine in December 1711.

Realising how unforthcoming he had been, Charles wrote to Florence agreeing to the project, mentioning but one clause: the Tuscan state must not be bequeathed to <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> of the House of Austria. At {{the culmination of the}} War of the Spanish Succession, at the Treaties of Utrecht and Rattstatt, Cosimo did not vie for international assurances for the Electress's succession.

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters {{on the right side of}} the screen and <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> on the left side of the screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E

As a result, Nguyễn Ánh and a few loyalists fled into the dense jungles of the Mekong Delta in the far south. Later, Nguyễn Ánh made Duyệt a Cai Cơ ("Commander") of his bodyguards.

5000|$|The {{kill zone}} should isolate and trap <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> <b>The</b> {{selection}} of a likely kill zone involves evaluating the terrain and making up for any inadequacies.

If the potential kill zone terrain restricts vehicle movement to one vehicle width at a time, then a suddenly disabled vehicle will help to isolate <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> Terrain that keeps <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> from {{moving out of the}} kill zone is useful for isolation, otherwise the ambushers will wish to place obstacles or munitions at the borders of the selected area. Especially important is separation between <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> and <b>the</b> ambushing units, to prevent a counterattack.|$|R

5|$|In the game's single-player mode, {{the player}} must explore a galaxy that is {{composed}} of 15 nonlinear worlds. Each world {{is composed of}} a series of stages with areas interconnected by different types of doors. Most doors open automatically, but some require a special action to be unlocked. For example, some doors require the player to defeat all <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> in the area, while others may require a specific key. Although the player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies, health-recovery gems and ammunition crates can be collected throughout the world to increase the player's resources. Power-ups can also be found to expand the player's health and ammunition capacity.|$|E
5|$|Later in the game's development, Chahi added laser pistols, {{including}} the one that Lester carries for several effects.

He also found that repeated laser fire by <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> helped to enunciate the rhythm of the game. Chahi would later add in the plasma ball that increased the available strategy to players. Several points in the game use elevators or teleporters to move Lester between levels; Chahi had used these instead of stairways, as it was difficult to produce proper animation for these.|$|E
