5|$|Spectre grossed $880.7 million worldwide; $135.5 {{million of}} the takings were {{generated}} from the UK market and $200.1 million from North America. Worldwide, this made it the second highest-grossing James Bond film after Skyfall, and the sixth highest-grossing film of 2015. Deadline.com calculated the net profit of the film to be $98.4 million when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film. Sony had expected the net profit of the film to be around $38 million had it performed to {{the same level of}} its predecessor. But since it earned 20 per cent less than Skyfall, <b>the</b> <b>profit</b> in actual was $24.6 million. Sony paid 50 percent of the production costs for the film — which totalled some $250 million after accounting for government incentives — but received only 25 percent of certain profits, once costs were recouped.

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the operation of Mountain Grove Campground, the majority of people traveling there were worshipers. In the 1870s and 1880s, the campground was one of the three largest camp meeting sites that residents of Columbia County attended. In 1875, approximately 2500 people attended the camp meeting. In 1881, it was decided that all <b>the</b> <b>profit</b> generated from the campground would be dedicated to expansion and improvement of it. In 1891, the duration of the camp meeting was increased from seven to thirteen days. However, some people traveled there for a vacation. Within 20 years of the campground's opening, {{the majority of the people}} going there were there for a vacation, and trains carried bands and other entertainment-related items to the campground. However, people still continued to go there in large numbers for camp meeting. Local newspapers also began to advertise the campground as a resort instead of a camp meeting site. This began with an advertisement written by John R. Rote, secretary of the Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association, in the Columbia County Republican on July 9, 1891.|$|E

When the time came for the video release of the tour, Warner Bros. decided to release it only in Japan, where Madonna's previous video albums had not been released. This decision was also backed by <b>the</b> <b>profit</b> that the Who's That Girl World Tour had achieved from its Japanese leg. Named as Who's That Girl: Live in Japan, the video contained a live date from the tour, filmed at Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo, Japan on June 22, 1987. It was also aired as a television special in Japan only and was the first television broadcast there, using Dolby Surround sound. The release was a commercial success, prompting Warner to release a different version of the tour video, for the rest of the world. Although the Japanese concert was released on VHS and LaserDisc, Warner Music Japan has never officially made it available on DVD.|$|E

5|$|The affront at {{the heart}} of Show Boat is still very alive today.

Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for <b>the</b> <b>profit</b> of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues to offend deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production.

5|$|Von Neumann's famous 9-page paper started {{life as a}} talk at Princeton {{and then}} became a paper in German, which was {{eventually}} translated into English. His interest in economics that led to that paper began as follows: When lecturing at Berlin in 1928 and 1929 he spent his summers back home in Budapest, {{and so did the}} economist Nicholas Kaldor, and they hit it off. Kaldor recommended that von Neumann read a book by the mathematical economist Léon Walras. Von Neumann found some faults in that book and corrected them, for example, replacing equations by inequalities. He noticed that Walras's General Equilibrium Theory and Walras' Law, which led to systems of simultaneous linear equations, could produce the absurd result that <b>the</b> <b>profit</b> could be maximized by producing and selling a negative quantity of a product. He replaced the equations by inequalities, introduced dynamic equilibria, among other things, and eventually produced the paper.|$|E
