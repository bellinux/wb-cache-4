5|$|The {{school has}} {{developed}} a specific program focus that includes film, photography, writing, and art, using Gordon Parks's life as an inspiration and guide. In partnership with the Minnesota Historical Society, students are documenting stages of transition along University Avenue through the stories of elders, business owners, and residents affected by the METRO Green Line light-rail transit project. The students {{learn more about the}} neighborhood's history, document stories of the LRT project <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> otherwise be told, and share images <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> otherwise be seen.|$|E
5|$|Research in 2009 {{has found}} that an {{indicator}} for an impaired protein production is common among all bees affected by CCD, a pattern consistent with IAPV infection. It is conjectured that Dicistroviridae, like the IAPV, cause degradation of the ribosomes, which are responsible for protein production of cells, and that this reduced ribosomal function weakens the bees, making them more vulnerable to factors <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> otherwise be lethal.|$|E
5|$|Gleason's theorem {{implies the}} nonexistence of {{certain types of}} hidden {{variable}} theories for quantum mechanics, strengthening a previous argument of John von Neumann. Von Neumann had claimed to show that hidden variable theories were impossible, but (as Grete Hermann pointed out) his demonstration made an assumption that quantum systems obeyed a form of additivity of expectation for noncommuting operators <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> hold a priori. In 1966, John Stewart Bell showed that Gleason's theorem {{could be used to}} remove this extra assumption from von Neumann's argument.|$|E

5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
5|$|Freitas finds {{numerous}} {{reasons why}} interstellar probes {{may be a}} preferred method of communication among extraterrestrial civilizations wishing {{to make contact with}} Earth. A civilization aiming {{to learn more about the}} distribution of life within the galaxy might, he speculates, send probes to a large number of star systems, rather than using radio, as one cannot ensure a response by radio but can (he says) ensure that probes will return to their sender with data on the star systems they survey. Furthermore, probes would enable the surveying of non-intelligent populations, or those not yet capable of space navigation (like humans before the 20th century), as well as intelligent populations <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> wish to provide information about themselves and their planets to extraterrestrial civilizations. In addition, the greater energy required to send living beings rather than a robotic probe would, according to Michaud, be only used for purposes such as a one-way migration.|$|E

25|$|Prisoners {{attacked}} the fence in an escape attempt on June 1 but were thwarted, mainly by guards {{on the ground}} using revolvers. Those on the fence lines were armed with rifles <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have worked. No prisoners {{were killed in the}} incident.|$|E

These procedures include hyperventilation, photic stimulation (with a strobe light), eye closure, mental activity, sleep and sleep deprivation. During (inpatient) epilepsy monitoring, a patient's typical seizure medications may be withdrawn.|$|E

Of potential relevance to hydrogen storage are MOFs with exposed metal sites.

25|$|Alluding to {{past and}} recent {{proposals}} of cease-fire negotiations, Ridgway also advised that future governmental decisions might compel the Eighth Army {{to adopt a}} static defense. Because of its inherent rigidity, such a stance would require strong leadership and imaginative tactical thinking, he warned, to stand off a numerically stronger enemy <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be similarly inhibited {{in the choice of}} tactics.|$|E
25|$|In addition, he {{made two}} other objections: that {{defendants}} {{might choose to}} forgo the defense despite {{the facts of the}} case out of fear that an inquiry into their predisposition to offend would allow the prosecution to bring up prior bad acts <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> otherwise be relevant, and that jury verdicts of entrapment were not as reliable in deriving precedent for future cases.|$|E

25|$|The {{evolution}} {{towards the}} net/node addressing scheme was also useful for reducing communications costs between continents, where timezone differences on {{either end of}} the connection might also come into play. For instance, the best time to forward mail in the US was at night, but <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be the best time for European hosts to exchange. Efforts towards introducing a continental level to the addressing system started in 1986.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} of reinforcement or punishment {{is dependent on}} schedule and timing. A reinforcer or punisher affects the future frequency of a behavior most strongly if it occurs within seconds of the behavior. A behavior that is reinforced intermittently, at unpredictable intervals, will be more robust and persistent, compared to one that is reinforced every time the behavior is performed. For example, if the misbehaving student in the above example was punished {{a week after the}} troublesome behavior, <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> affect future behavior.|$|E
25|$|Garratts {{have several}} {{advantages}} when used on light and narrow gauge railways. They are tank locomotives and {{can easily be}} run tender-first, thus {{eliminating the need for}} expensive turntables or wyes. They {{do not need to be}} run through to terminals, increasing operational flexibility. Because the engine units are separated by the boiler unit, the weight of the locomotive is split over the two units, and they can run over bridges or line sections <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be able to support conventional or Mallet locomotives of similar weight.|$|E
