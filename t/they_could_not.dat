40|$|It {{would be}} {{difficult}} not to notice the proliferation of documentary based filmmaking {{over the past few}} years and it would be almost impossible to have not witnessed the rise of moving image content online. It is now nearly ten years since the launch of the Canon 5 DMKII and the resulting ‘convergence’ conversations and debate, and now as I sit writing this in 2017 moving image functionality is an accepted aspect of most of our still cameras. Like it or not the moving image is part of the photographer’s world. The beginning of 2009 saw filmmakers – but very few photographers – energised by the possibilities the 5 D MKII offered them, opportunities to uses lenses <b>they</b> previously <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford, to get shots <b>they</b> previously <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get, to shoot in situations <b>they</b> previously <b>could</b> <b>not</b> film in and perhaps most importantly to tell stories <b>they</b> previously <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford to tell. Skilled in the arts of narrative, audio capture, film editing and photography – many had studied photography as part of their creative education – filmmakers saw the new technology as a natural extension of their existing practice.

5|$|Two {{other parties}} sought to be {{involved}} in the case as amici curiae, Amnesty International (represented by former Federal Court Justice Ron Merkel), and the Victorian human rights advocacy group the Human Rights Law Resource Centre. However both their applications were rejected, because <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> assist the court in a way in which <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> otherwise be assisted, and their submissions were largely subsumed into submissions made by Lasry in any event.|$|E

5|$|Irreducible {{complexity}} is {{the idea}} that certain biological systems cannot be broken down into their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the blood clotting cascade, the immune system, and the bacterial flagellum are so complex and interdependent that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have evolved from simpler systems.|$|E

5|$|A re-think was required. Cook had the unenviable task of {{explaining}} {{the failure to}} the government. Henceforth, he would take a tighter grip on the hydrogen bomb programme, gradually superseding Penney. The scientists and politicians considered abandoning Green Granite. The Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys, queried Cook on the imperative to persist with thermonuclear designs, given that Orange Herald satisfied most military requirements, and the tests were very expensive. Cook replied that megaton-range fission bombs represented an uneconomical use of expensive fissile material; that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be built to produce yields {{of more than a}} megaton; and that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be made small enough to be carried by aircraft smaller than the V-bombers, or on missiles. Sandys was not convinced, but he authorised further tests, as did the Prime Minister, now Harold Macmillan following Eden's resignation {{in the wake of the}} Suez crisis. The earliest possible date was November 1957 unless the Operation Antler tests were cancelled; but the Foreign Office warned that a moratorium on nuclear testing might come into effect in late October.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, the Allies {{spent the}} evening heatedly debating their course of action. The Peloponnesians were {{in favour of}} evacuating, {{and at this point}} Themistocles {{attempted}} his ruse with Xerxes.

5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and {{had been}} tested to ensure their readiness {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings could not be dismounted which meant that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be railed to Moscow either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E
