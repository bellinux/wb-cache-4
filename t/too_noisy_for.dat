25|$|In 2003, Old Ebbitt Grill was busiest on {{weekends}} in the spring, when {{high school student}} tourist business was at its highest in the city. The restaurant was praised by the Washington Post {{for being able to}} accommodate large groups, offering a variety of plain and upscale food, providing friendly service, and having the best raw bar in the city. The restaurant was also criticized by the newspaper for being <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> conversation, and providing bland hamburgers, salads, and breakfast. By 2008, however, Old Ebbitt Grill had improved. Post food critic Tom Sietsema continued to laud the friendly service. He also praised the Breakfast Club, a deep-fried ham, French toast, and bacon breakfast sandwich; he appreciated small touches such as coat hooks near booths and pepper mills on tables; and found the staff's honesty about menu choices refreshing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} {{featured a}} central circular block (officially {{known as the}} Main Block, but often referred to by staff as the [...] "doughnut") around which were studios, offices, engineering areas and the News Centre. In {{the centre of the}} main block was a statue designed by T.B. Huxley-Jones of Helios, the Greek god of the sun, to symbolise the radiation of television around the world. At the foot of the statue were two reclining figures, symbolising sound and vision, the components of television. It was originally a fountain, but owing to the building's unique shape it was <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> the staff in the overlooking offices, and there were problems with water leakage into the videotape area directly beneath. Even though there was a foundation stone marked 'BBC 1956' {{in the basement of the}} main building, construction began in 1951. Various extensions have been added.|$|E

25|$|Most older {{units have}} been retired from service in Buenos Aires, {{as they are}} {{considered}} <b>too</b> dangerous and <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> use in the fast-paced city. They were disposed of, or sent to smaller cities all over the country. Colectivos are usually retired only when they are too damaged to be repaired; {{some of them have}} “resuscitated” as fine motorhomes.|$|R
50|$|These {{networks}} were largely engineered {{for a specific}} application and are not suited to other applications. For example, the traditional telephone network is <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> and inefficient <b>for</b> bursty data communication. On the other hand, data networks which store and forward messages using computers had limited connectivity, usually did not have sufficient bandwidth for digitised voice and video signals, and suffer from unacceptable delays for the real-time signals. Television networks using radio or cables were largely broadcast networks with minimum switching facilities.|$|R

50|$|SOE also {{experienced}} difficulties with the Royal Navy, who were usually unwilling to allow SOE {{to use its}} submarines or motor torpedo boats to deliver agents or equipment. Submarines were regarded as too valuable to risk within range of enemy coastal defences, and MTBs were in any case often <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> and conspicuous <b>for</b> clandestine landings. However, SOE often used clandestine craft such as local fishing boats or caiques and eventually ran quite large fleets of these, from the Helford estuary, Algiers, the Shetland Islands (a service termed the Shetland Bus), Ceylon etc.|$|R
5000|$|The school's first {{classrooms}} were in {{the church}} building which was situated {{at the corner of}} Manchester Avenue and Church Street in May Pen. The records showed that {{on the first day of}} school, there was only one student who met with Mrs. H. Butler who was the principal. The growth was steady, if not rapid, and so in 1958 they had to add the high school section to take care of the students who had completed the elementary division. It was now called May Pen Academy to reflect its new status. Manchester Avenue became <b>too</b> busy and <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> Sabbath services, and so property was purchased in the quiet [...] "bushes" [...] at 18a Bryants Crescent to relocate the church and the school came along to share the facilities.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{stimulation}} is a rich, emotive and salient {{feedback channel}} that {{is suitable for}} mobile HCI. It can act as an alternative non-visual notification channel for mobile situations that are <b>too</b> bumpy or <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> vibrotactile and audio feedback. It can augment both visual and non-visual feedback to add an extra richness to the interaction experience. In addition, thermal output is entirely private, so it is suitable for quiet environments or when secrecy is important. This demonstration will consist of some example applications which highlight a variety of uses. We show an application titled "Tempera-tour", where environmental temperatures {{from around the world}} can be felt. We also show thermal augmentation of visual and audio media as a means of influencing hedonic experience. Finally we show simple thermal widgets, such as a thermal progress bar, ambient notifications and thermal availability information. This demo accompanies the paper "Thermal Icons: Evaluating Structured Thermal Feedback for Mobile Interaction...|$|R

It was a poor remnant of the entire afternoons which she and Sylvia had usually {{disposed}} of much as they pleased; and even what there was of it, {{was not to be}} spent in the way for which the young limbs longed. No one was likely to play at blind man's buff and hare and hounds in that house; and even her poor attempt at throwing her gloves or a pen-wiper against the wall, and catching them in the rebound, and her scampers up- stairs two steps at once, and runs down with a leap down the last four steps, were summarily stopped, as unladylike, and <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> Aunt Jane. Kate did get a private run and leap whenever she could, but never with a safe conscience; and that spoilt the pleasure, or made it guilty and alarmed.|$|E

It's bad for a girl to be alone, and especially a girl like Ruth. I don't mind telling you, Mr. Armstrong, that Hesba and I have an idea that she has got something on her mind, she has been so changed altogether since Miss Carne's murder. I might have thought that she had fretted about that scamp Forester going away, for at one time the girl was very fond of him, but before it happened {{she told me that she}} had found out he would never make her a good husband, and would break it off altogether with him; so you see I don't think his going away had anything to do with it. Once or twice I thought she was going to say something particular to me, but she has never said it, and she sits there and broods and broods till it makes my heart ache to see her. Now she has got your daughter to be friends with, perhaps she may shake it off." ...|$|E

Second, capacity demands and other run-time constraints may prohibit a straight CBR module from being deployed.

40|$|In N-body {{simulations}} {{the force}} calculated between particles representing a given mass distribution is usually softened, {{to diminish the}} effect of graininess. In this paper we study the effect of such a smoothing, {{with the aim of}} finding an optimal value of the softening parameter. As already shown by Merritt (1996), for too small a softening the estimates of the forces will be <b>too</b> <b>noisy,</b> while <b>for</b> <b>too</b> large a softening the force estimates are systematically misrepresented. In between there is an optimal softening, for which the forces in the configuration approach best the true forces. The value of this optimal softening depends both on the mass distribution and on the number of particles used to represent it. For higher number of particles the optimal softening is smaller. More concentrated mass distributions necessitate smaller softening, but the softened forces are never as good an approximation of the true forces as for not centrally concentrated configurations. We give good estimates of the optimal softening for homogeneous spheres, Plummer spheres, and Dehnen spheres. We also give a rough estimate of this quantity for other mass distributions, based on the harmonic mean distance to the $k$th neighbour ($k$ = 1, [...] , 12), the mean being taken over all particles in the configuration. Comparing homogeneous Ferrers ellipsoids of different shapes we show that the axial ratios do not influence the value of the optimal softening. Finally we compare two different types of softening, a spline softening (Hernquist & Katz 1989) and a generalisation of the standard Plummer softening to higher values of the exponent. We find that the spline softening fares roughly as well as the higher powers of the power-law softening and both give a better representation of the forces than the standard Plummer softening.

50|$|In 1993 another airline called Air Caribbean appeared. It {{was based}} at Piarco International Airport, Trinidad and Tobago, and used YS-11 {{aircraft}} {{for the first}} five years. The airline seemed to be doing reasonably well until the arrival of ageing Boeing 737 aircraft, in July 1998. These aircraft had fuel-thirsty and noisy JT8D engines, and were a financial burden on the airline. Air Caribbean intended to use the 737s on flights to Miami International Airport, but the planes were <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> American noise regulations. One of the 737s was so old that a hush kit couldn't be fitted. As a consequence, the planes had to be grounded whilst the hush-kits were fitted to the suitable aircraft.|$|E
50|$|DC motors {{allow the}} speed of the fans within a Fan Coil Unit to be {{controlled}} by means of a 0-10 Volt input 'Signal' to the motor/s, the transformers and speed switches associated with AC Fan Coils are not required. Up to a signal voltage of 2.5 Volts (which may vary with different fan/motor manufacturers) the fan will be in a stopped condition but as the signal voltage is increased, the fan will seamlessly increase in speed until the maximum is reached at a signal Voltage of 10 Volts. Fan Coils will generally operate between approximately 4 Volts and 7.5 Volts because below 4 Volts the air volumes are ineffective and above 7.5 Volts the Fan Coil is likely to be <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> most commercial applications.|$|E

5000|$|Selam Seyoum Woldemariam {{was born}} in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia, in 1954 to a director-teacher father, Seyoum Woldemariam Kidane, and an {{assistant}} teacher-housewife mother, Tsirha Nemariam. The family moved to Asmara, Eritrea, in 1965 and stayed there throughout his childhood (c. 1965-1972).While in Addis Ababa, his father worked in a school run by American missionaries. They brought various records of spiritual songs; Woldemariam and his siblings studied some of the songs and sang them at the Mekane Yesus Church in Addis Ababa. The family owned an acoustic guitar, and while each of his siblings tried to learn, {{he was the most}} disciplined in his musical study.During the mid-1960s, Woldemariam formed a church music quintet choir group in Asmara at [...] "Geza Kenisha", which became popular and pulled hundreds of followers to the church where they performed. Later, they included a Swedish drummer but the sound eventually became <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> the elderly congregation and they had to discontinue playing. Woldemariam returned to Addis Ababa in 1972 and finished high school. This was {{at the height of the}} Ethiopian Civil War and classes in most schools, including Addis Ababa University (AAU) were disrupted. Soon, all higher learning institutions were closed, while students and staff were forced to join the national campaign (Idget Behibret). With the AAU closed, Woldemariam could no longer continue his education.|$|E
50|$|Just before World War II, Tommy Flowers MBE, {{employed}} at the GPO, {{had been working}} on VF (voice frequency) signalling, using valves (vacuum tubes), and this had led him to realise that valves could be very reliable if not switched on and off. This gave him the confidence during the war to build the world's first digital computer, called Colossus, at Bletchley Park. This computer used about a thousand valves and was a major factor in helping British Intelligence to break the German codes, though details of this were only released in 2000. After the war, the success of Colossus encouraged him to contemplate the possibility of telephone exchanges each using tens of thousands of valves. He was told that this was impossible and he could not say he had already done it with Colossus because he was bound by the Official Secrets Act. However, a fully electronic prototype Time Division Multiplex Model Exchange was constructed at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill and then an experimental TDM exchange system was built and tested at Highgate Wood, North London, in 1962, but it was found to be beyond the technology of the time: the solid-state switching worked well, but the analogue transmission (which had worked on the short cable runs of a laboratory model at Dollis Hill) was <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> public service on the long cable runs of a large exchange.
