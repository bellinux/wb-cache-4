Some feed or hide camouflaged in the skirt of dead leaves, a favourite dry place for weta <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>in</b> winter. Many of the insect companions of C.australis have followed it into the domesticated surroundings of parks and home gardens. If the leaves are left to decay, the soil underneath cabbage trees becomes a black humus that supports a rich array of amphipods, earthworms and millipedes.|$|E

5|$|It was {{initially}} named the Folboat Troop, after {{the type of}} folding canoe employed in raiding operations, and then renamed No. 1 Special Boat Section in early 1941. Attached to Layforce, they moved to the Middle East. They worked with the 1st Submarine Flotilla based at Alexandria and carried out beach reconnaissance of Rhodes, evacuated troops left behind on Crete {{and a number of}} small-scale raids and other operations. In December 1941 Courtney returned to the United Kingdom where he formed No2 SBS, and No1 SBS became attached to the Special Air Service (SAS) as the Folboat Section. In June 1942, they took part in the Crete airfield raids. In September 1942, they carried out Operation Anglo, a raid on two airfields on the island of Rhodes, from which only two men returned. Destroying three aircraft, a fuel dump and numerous buildings, the surviving SBS men had <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>in</b> the countryside for four days before they could reach the waiting submarine. After the Rhodes raid, the SBS was absorbed into the SAS due to the casualties they had suffered.|$|E
5|$|Rosebeary, flying Cobra Blue Ghost 28, {{called a}} Mayday but {{was able to}} safely exit the area and landed his {{severely}} damaged helicopter. His aircraft was totaled. He and Gunner Warrant Officer Charles Gorski were {{picked up by a}} HH-53C helicopter (Jolly Green 67), without incident. Rosebeary warned other aircraft against crossing the river. When Morse in Sandy 07 learned that the quick-snatch had failed, he and his wingman Sandy 08 broke off engaging the North Vietnamese and returned to Da Nang. Both Sandys were found to be so damaged they would take several days to repair. At 9:00p.m., Nail 59, {{a new version of the}} OV-10A Bronco aircraft equipped with the Pave Nail LORAN radar piloted by Gary Ferentchak, took over FAC duties. The SAR efforts were suspended for the night and the U.S. and ARVN forces remained unaware of the true strength of the NVA offensive. Advised by the FAC to remain in place, Hambleton moved to a safer spot in the jungle and dug a hole <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>in</b> until morning. During the night, Nail 59 and King 27, an HC-130 commanded by Maj. Dennis Constant, stayed. They suddenly found themselves painted by Fan Song radar and narrowly missed getting shot down as well. At 53 years old, Hambleton was not a prime candidate to survive the cold, wet weather conditions.|$|E

5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>in</b> a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E
