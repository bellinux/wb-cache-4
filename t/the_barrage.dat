5|$|At 21:00 {{the first}} shells of what {{proved to be}} a two-hour North Korean {{artillery}} and mortar preparation against the American river positions of 2nd Platoon. As <b>the</b> <b>barrage</b> rolled on, North Korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire. At 23:00 <b>the</b> <b>barrage</b> lifted and the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon, forcing it from the hill after a short fight. Similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line.|$|E
5|$|A lone Japanese {{soldier was}} able to fire off three mortar rounds toward the main gate. Although members of F Company quickly located the soldier and killed him, several Rangers, Scouts, and POWs were wounded in the attack. Battalion surgeon Capt. James Fisher was mortally injured in the stomach and was carried to the nearby village of Balincari. Scout Alfred Alfonso had a {{shrapnel}} wound to his abdomen. Scout Lt. Tom Rounsaville and Ranger Pvt. 1st Class Jack Peters were also wounded by <b>the</b> <b>barrage.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, Pausanias {{refused to}} advance because good omens were not divined in the goat sacrifices that were performed. At this point, as Greek {{soldiers}} {{began to fall}} under <b>the</b> <b>barrage</b> of arrows, the Tegeans started to run at the Persian lines. Offering one last sacrifice and a prayer to the heavens {{in front of the}} Temple of Hera, Pausanias finally received favourable omens and gave the command for the Spartans to advance, whereupon they also charged the Persian lines.|$|E

5000|$|The Eastern Zhejiang Canal {{is made up}} of many natural rivers. To {{maintain}} the stable water levels and benefit agriculture along the banks, numerous water conservancy facilities were constructed along the canal. These are primarily composed of barrages, dams and gates. Among these, significant ones {{can be found on the}} central canal and tributaries of the canal such as the Yongxing Gate (located in Xiaoshan District, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province), <b>the</b> Caoe <b>Barrage,</b> <b>the</b> Lianghu <b>Barrage,</b> <b>the</b> Tongming <b>Barrage,</b> <b>the</b> Qingshui Gate (all located in Shangyu District, Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province), Doumen Gate, the Yunlou Xiaba Dam (both located in Yuyao, Zhejiang Province) and <b>the</b> Xidu <b>Barrage</b> (located in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province).|$|R
2500|$|Marksman {{remained}} {{part of the}} 12th Flotilla {{well into}} 1917, transferring to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Dover Patrol, on 26 August 1917. Large destroyers and leaders like Marksman tended to be employed on patrols along two routes to protect <b>the</b> Dover <b>Barrage,</b> <b>the</b> West <b>Barrage</b> Patrol and <b>the</b> East <b>Barrage</b> Patrol. On <b>the</b> night of 14/15 February 1918, Marksman and [...] were on <b>the</b> West <b>Barrage</b> Patrol while a further four destroyers formed <b>the</b> East <b>Barrage</b> Patrol, when seven German torpedo boats (equivalent to British destroyers) attacked <b>the</b> Dover <b>Barrage.</b> None of <b>the</b> defensive forces managed {{to interfere with the}} German attack, which sank one trawler and seven drifters while severely damaging a further one trawler, five drifters and one minesweeper.|$|R
5|$|On their right, the 1/10th Battalion, London Regiment (161st Brigade) {{finished}} capturing and consolidating the Rafa redoubt, {{which had}} only been partly captured by the 1/6th Battalion, The Essex Regiment. Without the assistance of tanks which had been put out of action, this battalion lost contact with <b>the</b> <b>barrage</b> and suffered heavy losses. Nevertheless, they captured Gun Hill and by 06:00 on 2 November they were preparing to attack Sheikh Hasan, which they captured fifteen minutes later along with 182 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarian {{high command}} {{did not attempt}} to perform a spoiling attack as they lacked the {{necessary}} vehicles and pack animals. <b>The</b> <b>barrage</b> did not cause a significant number of casualties but severely affected the Bulgarian esprit de corps. On the night between 14 and 15 September, Franco-Serbian patrols reported that the artillery barrage had dealt sufficient damage to the barbed wire entanglements separating the trenches.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{response of the}} British was a two-hour cannon barrage at the heights, which had no effect because the British guns could not reach the American guns at such height. After the failure of <b>the</b> <b>barrage,</b> Howe and his officers agreed that the colonists must {{be removed from the}} heights if they were to hold Boston. They planned an assault on the heights; however, due to a storm the attack never took place, and the British elected instead to withdraw.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an effort}} to test markets as {{potential}} expansion/relocation candidates, <b>the</b> Philadelphia <b>Barrage</b> franchise played all of its 2008 [...] "home" [...] matches in five other cities; Cary, North Carolina; Hillsboro, Oregon; Irving, Texas; St. Louis; and Virginia Beach. In addition <b>the</b> <b>Barrage's</b> [...] "home game" [...] against Boston was played in Boston.|$|R
5|$|To keep enemy {{action to}} a minimum during the assault, a {{creeping}} barrage was planned. This required gunners to create a curtain of high explosive and shrapnel shell explosions that crept across the battlefield in lines, about one hundred metres {{in advance of the}} assaulting troops. The Allies had previously used creeping barrages at the battles of Neuve Chapelle and the Somme but had encountered two technical problems. The first was accurately synchronising the movement of the troops to the fall of the barrage: for Arras, this was overcome by rehearsal and strict scheduling. The second was <b>the</b> <b>barrage</b> falling erratically as the barrels of heavy guns wore swiftly but at differing rates during fire: for Arras, the rate of wear of each gun barrel was calculated and calibrated accordingly. While there was a risk of friendly fire, the creeping barrage forced the Germans to remain in their shelters, allowing Allied soldiers to advance without fear of machine gun fire. The new instantaneous No. 106 Fuze had been adapted from a French design for high-explosive shells so that they detonated on the slightest impact, vaporising barbed wire. Poison gas shells were used for the final minutes of <b>the</b> <b>barrage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Various {{proposals}} {{have been put}} forward to construct a Severn Barrage for tidal electricity production from Brean Down to Lavernock Point in south Wales. The proposals, which go back over 100 years, have never been successful so far, however Peter Hain and others are still working on further proposals and trying to persuade the government to fund either <b>the</b> <b>barrage</b> or tidal lagoons.|$|E
5|$|After Aubers Ridge, {{the corps}} was then rested {{in a quiet}} sector until September, when it {{deployed}} for the Battle of Loos. The initial attack was {{to be made by}} three divisions, with the Meerut Division leading the attack on the Indian front; Blackader's brigade, with two Gurkha battalions and the 2nd Leicesters, was on its right flank. Whilst the attack successfully crossed no-man's land under cover of <b>the</b> <b>barrage,</b> the right flank of the brigade was caught up in defensive wire, and only one battalion successfully made their way into the German trenches; the brigade lost momentum and dug in.|$|E

5|$|After an {{hour and}} a half had gone (and twenty minutes had passed since the second attack) the Indonesians {{launched}} a third and final attack up the slope towards the base, which the British responded to with artillery and grenade fire. This defence was remarkably effective, and eventually <b>the</b> <b>barrage</b> of Indonesian rocket fire halted and the few remaining British soldiers rose from their hideouts and began to clear the perimeter. Soon afterwards, Gurkha soldiers and medical staff arrived at the base by helicopter, leaving the soldiers behind to secure the area and airlifting the wounded to a nearby hospital. By this point, however, Indonesian forces had withdrawn, effectively ending the battle.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the raid, it was decided by the British naval command that unless {{sufficient}} destroyers were available to protect <b>the</b> <b>barrage,</b> the drifters would have to be withdrawn at night. The drifters would only be operating for less than twelve hours a day, and would have to leave their positions by 15:00 every day. Despite the damage received by the Austro-Hungarian cruisers during the pursuit by Dartmouth and Bristol, the Austro-Hungarian forces inflicted more serious casualties on the Allied blockade. In addition to the sunk and damaged drifters, the cruiser Dartmouth was nearly sunk by the German submarine UC-25, the French destroyer Boutefeu was mined and sunk, and a munitions convoy to Valona was interdicted.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} victory against an Egyptian army at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, the {{standard}} British tactic against an entrenched position was an approach march {{at night in}} close order to maintain cohesion, followed by deployment into open order within {{a few hundred yards}} of the objective and a frontal attack with the bayonet at first light. Methuen planned to bombard the Boer positions with artillery from 16:50 to 18:30 on 10 December. Following <b>the</b> <b>barrage,</b> the newly arrived Highland Brigade under Major General Wauchope was to make a night march that would position them to launch a frontal attack on the Boers at dawn the following day. Wauchope had argued for a flanking attack along the Modder River, but had been unable to convince his superior.|$|E
50|$|In 1954, {{fisherman}} A. W. Lundstrom {{wrote that}} before <b>the</b> <b>barrages</b> were built across the River Murray, seals were often seen {{near the town}} of Goolwa. Construction of <b>the</b> <b>barrages</b> began in 1935 and they were completed in 1940. Lundstrom, acting as President of the Southern Fishermen's Association wrote of the seals:"We as fishermen still maintain that the seal is a menace to the fishing industry {{in the same way as}} the rabbits, dingoes or kangaroos are to the landholder."The same year W. W. Jenkins suggested in Parliament that an open season should be called to keep seal numbers in check.|$|R
5000|$|Schiffenensee [...] or lac de Schiffenen is an {{artificial}} lake formed by a <b>barrage</b> of <b>the</b> Saane/Sarine {{river in the}} canton of Fribourg, Switzerland. <b>The</b> <b>barrages</b> at Schiffenen, Düdingen municipality, were completed in 1963.|$|R
50|$|The {{intent was}} to use water stored by <b>the</b> Ramadi <b>Barrage</b> and <b>the</b> Samarra <b>Barrage</b> for irrigation. However, {{evaporation}} on Lakes Habbaniyah and Tharthar led to reduced storage and high salinity, conditions unsuitable for irrigation.|$|R
5|$|Hart {{was made}} {{commander}} of the 2nd Infantry Brigade when the 4th Brigade was disbanded in February 1918. He was mentioned in despatches for his work with the 4th Infantry Brigade while {{it was on the}} front line. His new brigade absorbed many of the soldiers of his previous command. However, on 18 February, just two weeks after taking command, he was badly gassed during an artillery barrage on his headquarters. <b>The</b> <b>barrage,</b> using a mixture of high explosive and mustard gas shells, also incapacitated most of his staff. Temporarily blinded, he was evacuated to a hospital in the rear and then to Étaples. After recovering his sight, which took about a week, he was dispatched to the south of France to convalesce.|$|E
5|$|Other Russian {{forces were}} more {{successful}} {{to the north}} of the town, where they managed to capture the village of Mokre from the 28th Regiment. The regiment counter-charged the village, but was initially driven off. However, approximately 80 pieces of emplaced Polish artillery laid a 30-minute barrage on the village. It was the greatest concentration of artillery fire in the war up to that point, and had a tremendous effect on the morale of the Russian defenders. After <b>the</b> <b>barrage</b> ended Lieutenant Colonel Wiktor Thommée personally led his forces in a bayonet charge; the regiment re-entered Mokre at noon and the Russians fled.|$|E
5|$|The {{bombs and}} fire lances of the Jin {{were the only}} two weapons of the Jurchens that the Mongols were wary of facing. The Jurchen {{deployment}} of gunpowder was extensive, but it is not certain if the Mongols had acquired gunpowder from the Jurchens before this point. Herbert Franke maintains that gunpowder was in the arsenal of both combatants, but Turnbull believes that only the Jurchens made use of it. The Mongols loaded their catapults with large stones or bombs of gunpowder, which were fired at the Jin fortifications. <b>The</b> <b>barrage</b> inflicted casualties in the city and had a psychological impact on the soldiers operating the Jurchen trebuchets.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} the First World War {{dramatically}} shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind <b>the</b> <b>barrage.</b> Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare, with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed {{in the air as}} much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British War Department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} {{charge was}} preceded by what Lee hoped would be a powerful and well-concentrated cannonade of the Union center, destroying the Union artillery batteries that could defeat the assault and demoralizing the Union infantry. But a combination of inept artillery leadership and defective equipment doomed <b>the</b> <b>barrage</b> from the beginning. Longstreet's corps artillery chief, Col. Edward Porter Alexander, had effective command of the field; Lee's artillery chief, Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton, played little role other than to obstruct the effective placement of artillery from the other two corps. Despite Alexander's efforts, then, there was insufficient concentration of Confederate fire on the objective.|$|E
5|$|The {{resistance}} was alerted {{to carry out}} these tasks by messages personnels transmitted by the BBC's French service from London. Several hundred of these messages, which might be snatches of poetry, quotations from literature, or random sentences, were regularly transmitted, masking the few that were actually significant. In the weeks preceding the landings, lists of messages and their meanings were distributed to resistance groups. An increase in radio activity on 5 June was correctly interpreted by German intelligence to mean that an invasion was imminent or underway. However, because of <b>the</b> <b>barrage</b> of previous false warnings and misinformation, most units ignored the warning.|$|E
