Espenson was [...] "thrilled" [...] to be assigned the episode; Jiminy Cricket was typically a character that appeared in other people's stories, so she was eager to explore him in his own narrative.

It took Jiminy a long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> how {{to get away from}} the life he was living, and I think a lot of people feel like that."

500|$|A year later, {{the option}} {{on the book}} became {{available}} and was purchased by Aaron Ryder of Newmarket Films. In late 2001, Nolan became busy with the post-production of Insomnia, and asked his brother Jonathan to help work on the script. The writing process was a long collaboration between the Nolan brothers, occurring intermittently {{over a period of}} five years. In the script, the Nolans emphasized the magic of the story through the dramatic narrative, playing down the visual depiction of stage magic. The three-act screenplay was deliberately structured around the three elements of the film's illusion: the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. [...] "It took a long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> how to achieve cinematic versions of the very literary devices that drive the intrigue of the story," [...] Christopher Nolan told Variety: [...] "The shifting points of view, the idea of journals within journals and stories within stories. Finding the cinematic equivalents of those literary devices was very complex." [...] Although the film is thematically faithful to the novel, two major changes were made to the plot structure during the adaptation process: the novel's spiritualism subplot was removed, and the modern-day frame story was replaced with Borden's wait for the gallows. Priest approved of the adaptation, describing it as [...] "an extraordinary and brilliant script, a fascinating adaptation of my novel." ...|$|E

[...] Her groom, Ruben Mercado, said she was a [...] "little angel" [...] in the stables but [...] "all business" [...] on the track. Mandella used earplugs and a hood with ear coverings (colloquially called [...] "earmuffs") to help keep her focused. At one point, he tried giving her ear buds, but the sound upset her even more. Mandella was described as the [...] "perfect" [...] trainer for her, as he was willing to try different training techniques to keep her from getting in her own way, took the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> her quirks, and learned to anticipate her behavior. [...] The bond and depth of communication between trainer and horse was noted in the press. Mandella's son Gary described Beholder as having an [...] "Alpha Male perspective," [...] explaining, [...] "She’s actually dominant, bullyish and head strong. She’s not quirky because she’s worried that something is lurking around the corner. The things that she does that are hard to manage are because she’s tougher than you." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{some time}} {{developing}} demos, the musicians returned to Henson in March 2012, recording seven songs before the band {{decided to take}} a break, as according to guitarist Mike McCready [...] "we had to take some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what we wanted to do." [...] Guitarist Stone Gossard added that despite the bandmembers thinking that after the productive sessions the album was nearing completion, eventually they considered the tracks [...] "didn’t feel strong enough for a record. Work on the album resumed only in March 2013 as the bandmembers regrouped with new compositions, mostly done separatedly in each member's home studio—though McCready at times worked along with drummer Matt Cameron—before the group reunited to finish the songs together. O'Brien attributed the long break to the band's busy schedule, as the musicians got into side projects after putting the Pearl Jam album on hold: singer Eddie Vedder started a solo tour, drummer Matt Cameron returned to Soundgarden, guitarist Stone Gossard rejoined side project Brad, Ament recorded solo album While My Heart Beats and started the project RNDM, and McCready formed the group Walking Papers while also taking part in a partial reunion of Mad Season. Vedder still considered that all the diversions helped Pearl Jam to have [...] "more importance placed on the records" [...] and focusing on making the best album possible. Like with previous records the songs had their first recordings with all the musicians playing together, though O'Brien added that with Lightning Bolt [...] "we don’t keep as much of [...] as we used to." [...] Guest musicians include O'Brien himself at the keyboards, long time keyboardist Boom Gaspar, and violinist Ann Marie Calhoun. After six weeks of new recording sessions, the album was mixed in Seattle at the band's desire, with the process taking place in Studio X.|$|E

40|$|Problem solving is a {{big part}} of design, however a lot of {{emphasis}} is put on creativity in research related to the effects of stress. Research has shown that the amount of stress we feel affects idea generation. Stress may also affect the ability to solve problems, however the researchers don’t seem to agree about what the effect of stress actually does. The study was made through experimental sessions where the respondents were asked to solve 4 matchstick puzzles of similar difficulty. Depending on their outcome they experienced more or less stress. They all experienced greater amounts of stress in the puzzles that took them longer <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out.</b> Along with the experimental sessions, I also interviewed the respondents about their personal relationship with problem solving in their daily and professional life. I found that problem solving is intertwined and compounded with creativity through both problem solving being a part of the creative process, and problem solving needing the creative elements to generate ideas for solutions. But more than anything the study showed that problem solving in fact could be a stress trigger. ...|$|R
50|$|The late 1870s/early 1880s {{introduction}} of arc lighting systems (a {{new type of}} bright street light running from central generating stations producing 3000-6000 volts) {{was followed by the}} a strange new phenomenon of people being killed (almost instantaneously) by the high voltages used. Buffalo dentist Alfred P. Southwick's exploration into this phenomenon would eventually lead to the invention of the electric chair. Early on he enlisted the help of Dr. George Fell, along {{with the head of the}} Buffalo ASPCA, in whole series of experiments electrocuting hundreds of stray dogs, experimenting with animals in water, out of water, electrode types and placement, and conduction material, eventually coming up with a repeatable method to euthanize animals via electricity. Fell would conduct a further series experiments, electrocuting anesthetized dissected dogs trying to discern exactly how electricity killed a subject. His observations of the animals lead him to believe death was being caused by the heart stopping instantaneously. His experiments were the closest at the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> the causes of death by electrocution, although he was unaware of the other cause of death, the effect electricity was having on the nervous system.|$|R
2500|$|Yellowcard {{announced}} {{in an interview}} in April 2008 that the group would be going on an [...] "indefinite hiatus." [...] The band's European tour set for 2008 was canceled, and they instead embarked on an acoustic tour in the spring of 2008 before going on hiatus. Among the reasons for the band's hiatus were individual member situations. Longineu Parsons took some time off in the winter to spend time with family and joined a side project band based in Jacksonville, Florida. Sean Mackin got married in 2008 and wanted to take some time off to spend with his family. Ryan Key stated that the members needed some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> their personal lives. The band members were unsure of the hiatus' length, but they assured their fans they planned to return as a group. In May 2008, Yellowcard left Capitol Records and was left unsigned.
