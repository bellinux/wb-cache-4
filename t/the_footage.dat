5|$|The film clips are a motif used {{to enhance}} {{the theme of the}} desire to find meaning or detect patterns. They are {{released}} over the internet and gain a cult following, {{in the same way that}} the lonelygirl15 videoblog gained an international following in 2006. Corporate interest in <b>the</b> <b>footage</b> is aroused by its originality and global distribution methods. The characters debate whether the anonymous clips are part of a complete narrative or a work in progress, and when or where they were shot. This enigmatic nature of <b>the</b> <b>footage</b> is said to metaphorically represent the nature of the confusing and uncertain post-9/11 future. The author Dennis Danvers has remarked that <b>the</b> <b>footage</b> being edited down to a single frame is like the world compressed into a single novel. <b>The</b> <b>footage,</b> released freely to a global audience with a lack of time or place indicators, has also been contrasted to Pattern Recognition written under contract for a large corporation and which uses liminal name-dropping that definitively sets it in London, Tokyo, and Moscow in 2002.|$|E

5000|$|Pat Jackson, the film's {{sound effects}} editor, {{said that the}} biggest {{challenge}} in doing sound for the film was [...] "making <b>the</b> archival <b>footage</b> and <b>the</b> live-action <b>footage</b> shot locally appear seamless." ...|$|R
5000|$|Most of <b>the</b> live <b>footage</b> is from 1991 and 1992, {{with home}} video footage {{dating back to}} late-1990. <b>The</b> latest <b>footage</b> is from January 23, 1993 at the Hollywood Rock Festival in Brazil.|$|R

5|$|Because {{the filming}} {{was done by}} the actors using {{hand-held}} cameras, much of <b>the</b> <b>footage</b> is shaky, especially the final sequence in which a character is running down a set of stairs with the camera. Some audience members experienced motion sickness and even vomited as a result.|$|E

James Fallows agreed that Jamal and Muhammad first made an appearance in <b>the</b> <b>footage</b> around 3:00pm, judging by comments from Jamal and some journalists on the scene. Abu Rahma said he remained at the junction for 30–40 minutes after the shooting. According to Schapira, he left for his studio in Gaza at around 4 pm, where he sent <b>the</b> <b>footage</b> to Enderlin in Jerusalem at around 6 pm.

5|$|Michael Jackson's This Is It is a 2009 American documentary–concert film {{directed}} by Kenny Ortega that documents Michael Jackson's rehearsals and preparation for his concert {{series of the}} same name that was originally scheduled to start on July 13, 2009, but was cancelled due to his death eighteen days prior on June 25. The film consists of Jackson rehearsing musical numbers, directing his team, and additional behind-the-scenes footage including dancer auditions and costume design. Ortega confirmed that none of <b>the</b> <b>footage</b> was originally intended for release, but after Jackson's death it was agreed that the film be made. <b>The</b> <b>footage</b> was filmed in Los Angeles at the Staples Center and The Forum, and features a clip from East Rutherford's Arena where Jackson publicly announced the concert series.|$|E

5000|$|For best results, footage {{should be}} deinterlaced and frame-doubled to 60p. This {{preserves}} all of <b>the</b> <b>footage's</b> temporal information, which is key {{in determining what}} the [...] "missing" [...] points in time should look like when converting to 24 frame/s.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Maysles shot <b>footage</b> of <b>the</b> Beales {{and decided}} {{they would make}} better {{subjects}} for a documentary.

However, the Maysles returned and refocused their documentary on <b>the</b> Beales. This <b>footage</b> became <b>the</b> 1975 documentary Grey Gardens.|$|R
50|$|An axial cut can be {{made with}} the use of a zoom lens, or {{physically}} moving the camera with a crane or camera dolly. <b>The</b> intervening <b>footage</b> (as <b>the</b> camera moves or zooms) is then removed while editing <b>the</b> film. Since <b>footage</b> is discarded, this technique works better for static shots. If action is involved, several takes will be required to get <b>the</b> necessary <b>footage.</b>|$|R
5|$|Singer {{spent an}} 18-hour day {{shooting}} the underground parking garage robbery.

5|$|The Wembley Stadium {{scene in}} the film 28 Weeks Later was {{actually}} filmed at the Millennium Stadium. Although the outside is footage of Wembley, the inside is all filmed in Cardiff. The effects team on the film edited <b>the</b> <b>footage</b> {{to make it look}} more like Wembley.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>footage</b> shows Jamal and Muhammad {{crouching}} {{behind the}} cylinder, the child screaming {{and the father}} shielding him. Jamal appears to shout something {{in the direction of}} the cameraman, then waves and shouts {{in the direction of the}} Israeli outpost. There is a burst of gunfire and the camera goes out of focus. When the gunfire subsides, Jamal is sitting upright and injured and Muhammad is lying over his legs. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from <b>the</b> <b>footage</b> that shows Muhammad lift his hand from his face. This cut became the basis of much of the controversy over the film.|$|E
50|$|To develop <b>the</b> laserdisc <b>footage,</b> two developers, Mike Hally and Moe Shore, {{sifted through}} miles of <b>footage</b> from <b>the</b> film, amounting to 20 to 30 hours' worth.

50|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to get the film a wider release, Alfredo Leone {{convinced}} a reluctant Mario Bava that they should revamp the entire film as an Exorcist clone, in order {{to cash in on the}} popularity of that film, complete with new footage being shot of an exorcism involving Elke Sommer and Robert Alda, who was cast as a priest in <b>the</b> new <b>footage.</b> <b>The</b> film itself was then heavily cut, removing over twenty minutes of <b>footage</b> (including <b>the</b> film's ending) and having <b>the</b> remaining <b>footage</b> edited into <b>the</b> new <b>footage</b> as an extended flashback sequence that Sommer's character recalls to Alda's character.|$|R
50|$|The film survives in an {{incomplete}} print, but <b>the</b> missing <b>footage</b> does not critically affect the storyline.

5000|$|Akihiro “Yuji” Noguchi choreographed {{the action}} {{sequences}} of the show.

The suits for the Kamen Riders and monsters were re-fabricated and sent by Toei. The costume department was always on-set to have the suits camera-ready due to taking [...] "abuse" [...] {{not only from the}} American production but the previous Japanese production.
