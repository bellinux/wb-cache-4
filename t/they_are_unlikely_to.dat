5|$|This {{species is}} {{classified}} as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List (v3.1, 2007). Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution, presumed large population, or because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. When last assessed in 2007, the population trend was stable.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the vulcanoids would be very rich in {{elements}} with a high melting point, such as iron and nickel. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> possess a regolith because such fragmented material heats and cools more rapidly, and is affected more strongly by the Yarkovsky effect, than solid rock. Vulcanoids are probably similar to Mercury in colour and albedo, and may contain material {{left over from the}} earliest stages of the Solar System's formation.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that smaller-sized P. rebeli from Hungary {{normally}} eclose {{at the end of}} June or mid-July; however, when these populations are studied in laboratories, they do not eclose until late August. This has led researchers to speculate that P. rebeli larvae that do not receive adequate food can still fully develop in one year and act as a functioning adult. However, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be bivoltine (producing two broods in one season). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that certain researchers claim that P. rebeli larvae can have continuous development.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} given to Rolling Stone on 3 November 2014, Phil Manzanera stated that Roxy Music had been inactive since 2011 and that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> perform together again.|$|R
50|$|Ships of this {{category}} {{were designed for}} overseas duty where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> encounter first class opposition. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> useful for showing the flag, suppressing piracy, escorting convoys during wartime, supporting colonial governments, and generally intimidating minor powers. They had some use in countering armed merchant cruisers of a hostile navy.|$|R
5000|$|Simply {{declining to}} enlist, if the {{potential}} conscript appears likely {{to avoid the}} draft through sheer [...] "luck of the draw". During the Vietnam War, not all eligible young men were drafted; many who had a high lottery number registered for the draft but took no further action, knowing that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> ever <b>be</b> drafted. Declining to enlist is not evasion.|$|R
5|$|The {{defeat of}} Domnall's {{rebellion}} {{led to more}} conflict between Earl Harald and King William. After 1187, it appears that Scots and Scotto-Norman nobles were being planted in Ross and in Cromarty, as had previously happened in Moray. The de Moravia family, anglicised as Moray or Murray, which later produced Andrew Moray, were granted lands in Ross and Cromarty, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> have been unique in this award. When King William fell ill in 1195, {{this may have been}} the catalyst for the final conflict with Harald, which lasted from 1197 until 1201. As part of this struggle, William granted lands in Caithness to Harald the Young, grandson of Rognvald Kali, in 1197. Harald the Young was killed by Harald Maddadsson the following year.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{complexities of}} RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained mental health expert with particular expertise in differential diagnosis is considered essential. Several other disorders, such as conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms {{and are often}} comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, childhood schizophrenia and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization. Autistic children {{are likely to be}} of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> improve upon being removed from the home.|$|E
5|$|Small {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces do {{not always}} require treatment, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> proceed to respiratory failure or tension pneumothorax, and generally resolve spontaneously. This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the pneumothorax is small (defined as <50% {{of the volume of}} the hemithorax), there is no breathlessness, and there is no underlying lung disease. It may be appropriate to treat a larger PSP conservatively if the symptoms are limited. Admission to hospital is often not required, as long as clear instructions are given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms. Further investigations may be performed as an outpatient, at which time X-rays are repeated to confirm improvement, and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence (see below). Estimated rates of resorption are between 1.25% and 2.2% the volume of the cavity per day. This would mean that even a complete pneumothorax would spontaneously resolve over a period of about 6 weeks. There; however, is no high quality evidence comparing conservative to non conservative management.|$|E

50|$|The Alliance {{was led by}} the English Democrats and Jury Team.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that white dwarfs with surface temperatures of less than 10,000 kelvins could harbor a habitable zone {{at a distance of}} c. 0.005 to 0.02 AU that would last upwards of 3 billion years. The goal is to search for transits of hypothetical Earth-like planets that could have migrated inward and/or formed there. As a white dwarf has a size similar to that of a planet, these kinds of transits would produce strong eclipses. Newer research casts some doubts on this idea, given that the close orbits of those hypothetical planets around their parent stars would subject them to strong tidal forces that could render them unhabitable by triggering a greenhouse effect. Another suggested constraint to this idea is the origin of those planets. Leaving aside in-situ formation on an accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf, there are two ways a planet could end in a close orbit around stars of this kind: by surviving being engulfed by the star during its red giant phase, and then spiraling towards its core, or inward migration after the white dwarf has formed. The former case is implausible for low-mass bodies, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> survive being absorbed by their stars. In the latter case, the planets would have to expel so much orbital energy as heat, through tidal interactions with the white dwarf, that they would likely end as uninhabitable embers.|$|E

Lu wrote that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> [...] "unable to suggest a function" [...] for the tubercles of this species, but that due to their small size and spacing <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in buoyancy or locomotion.|$|R

25|$|Basking sharks {{have few}} predators. White sharks have been {{reported}} to scavenge on the remains of these sharks.

25|$|Unlike sterilization, {{pasteurization}} is {{not intended}} to kill all microorganisms in the food.

Commercial-scale sterilization of food is not common because it adversely affects the taste and quality of the product.
