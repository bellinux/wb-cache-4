5|$|Starting in November 2010, {{with the}} {{introduction}} of new product suites, <b>the</b> <b>Intel</b> Itanium Compilers were no longer bundled with <b>the</b> <b>Intel</b> x86 compilers in a single product. Intel offers Itanium tools and Intel x86 tools, including compilers, independently in different product bundles.|$|E
5|$|Early A320s used <b>the</b> <b>Intel</b> 80186 and Motorola 68010. In 1988, {{the flight}} {{management}} computer contained six Intel 80286 CPUs, running in three logical pairs, with 2.5 megabytes of memory.|$|E

5|$|Windows Mobile 5.0 {{requires}} {{at least}} 64 MBs of ROM (it's advisable to have 64 MBs of RAM), and the device must run an ARM compatible processor such as <b>the</b> <b>Intel</b> XScale or the Samsung and Texas Instruments ARM compatibles.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{several months}} {{after the release of}} Net-2, William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz wrote {{replacements}} for those six missing files, ported BSD to <b>the</b> <b>Intel</b> 80386-based microprocessors, and called their new operating system 386BSD. They released 386BSD via an anonymous FTP server. The development flow of 386BSD was slow and after a period of neglect, a group of 386BSD users decided to branch out on their own and create FreeBSD so that they could keep the operating system up to date. The first version of FreeBSD was released on November 1993.|$|E
5|$|The Altair 8800 kit {{came with}} a front panel, a CPU board with <b>the</b> <b>Intel</b> 8080 microprocessor, 256 bytes of RAM, a 4-slot {{backplane}} and an 8-amp power supply for $439. A 1k byte memory board was $176 and the 4k byte was $264. The serial interface board was $124 and the parallel interface was $119. There was a special price for an 8k byte system with BASIC for $995. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was $1500.|$|E
50|$|Even <b>the</b> <b>Intel's</b> CPU {{specifications}} {{seem to be}} {{not clear}} enough on the distinction and instead use the package/socket designations PGA478 or PPGA478 for more than 1 of the above sockets.|$|R
50|$|On July 27, 2006, Intel's Core 2 {{processors}} were released. By Q2 2007, Intel expected 90% of its laptop CPU {{production to}} be converted to <b>the</b> heavily revised <b>Intel</b> Core 2 processors. <b>The</b> original <b>Intel</b> Core (Yonah) product had an unusually short lifespan as a stepping stone to <b>the</b> 64-bit <b>Intel</b> Core 2.|$|R
50|$|Before <b>the</b> {{introduction}} of <b>Intel</b> HD Graphics, Intel integrated graphics were {{built into the}} motherboard's northbridge, as part of <b>the</b> <b>Intel's</b> Hub Architecture. They were known as Intel Extreme Graphics and Intel GMA. As part of the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) design, the northbridge was eliminated and graphics processing {{was moved to the}} same die as the central processing unit (CPU).|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Intel</b> 8080 did {{not have}} {{dedicated}} circuitry to support dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) because in 1975, this type of memory was still a new technology. MITS wanted to use DRAM because it consumed less power than static RAM. However, they had several design and component problems {{that led to a}} high failure rate with their 4K Dynamic RAM board. By July, new companies such as Processor Technology were selling 4K Static RAM boards with the promise of reliable operation. MITS released its own 4K Static RAM board in January 1976.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} MacBook, {{available in}} {{black or white}} colors, was released on June 28, 2006, and used <b>the</b> <b>Intel</b> Core Duo processor and 945GM chipset, with Intel's GMA 950 integrated graphics on a 667MHz front side bus. Later revisions of the MacBook moved to the Core 2 Duo processor and the GM965 chipset, with Intel's GMA X3100 integrated graphics on an 800MHz system bus. Sales of the black polycarbonate MacBook ceased in October 2008, after {{the introduction of the}} aluminum MacBook.|$|E
5|$|The MacBook Pro {{comes with}} the {{successor}} to BIOS, Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) 1.1. EFI handles booting differently from BIOS-based computers, but provides backwards compatibility, allowing dual and triple boot configurations. In addition to OS X, the Microsoft Windows operating system is installable on Intel x86-based Apple computers. Officially, this is limited to both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 with the necessary hardware drivers included with the Boot Camp software. Other x86 operating systems such as Linux are also unofficially supported. This is {{made possible by the}} presence of <b>the</b> <b>Intel</b> architecture as provided by the CPU and the BIOS emulation Apple has provided on top of EFI.|$|E
50|$|Downsides of <b>the</b> <b>Intel's</b> lockstep memory layout are the {{reduction}} of effectively usable amount of RAM (in case of a triple-channel memory layout, maximum amount of memory reduces to {{one third of the}} physically available maximum), and reduced performance of the memory subsystem.|$|R
50|$|The xAPIC was {{introduced}} with the Pentium 4, while the x2APIC {{is the most}} recent generation of <b>the</b> <b>Intel's</b> programmable interrupt controller, introduced with the Nehalem microarchitecture. The major improvements of the x2APIC address the number of supported CPUs and performance of the interface.|$|R
50|$|Source {{code for}} a UEFI shell can be {{downloaded}} from <b>the</b> <b>Intel's</b> TianoCore UDK2010 / EDK2 SourceForge project. Shell v2 works best in UEFI 2.3+ systems and is recommended over the shell v1 in those systems. Shell v1 should work in all UEFI systems.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Intel</b> Inside {{advertising}} campaign sought public brand loyalty {{and awareness of}} Intel processors in consumer computers. Intel paid some of the advertiser's costs for an ad that used <b>the</b> <b>Intel</b> Inside logo and xylo-marimba jingle.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Intel</b> Scientific Computers {{division}} {{was founded in}} 1984 by Justin Rattner, in order to design and produce parallel computers based on Intel microprocessors connected in hypercube topologies. In 1992, the name was changed to <b>the</b> <b>Intel</b> Supercomputing Systems Division, {{and development of the}} iWarp architecture was also subsumed. The division designed several supercomputer systems, including <b>the</b> <b>Intel</b> iPSC/1, iPSC/2, iPSC/860, Paragon and ASCI Red. In November 2014, Intel revealed {{that it is going to}} use light beams to speed up supercomputers. The renowned chip maker has also disclosed that all its Supercomputer forms will use optical technology for data transfer from 2015.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Intel's</b> i486SL is <b>the</b> power-saving {{variant of}} the i486DX microprocessor. The SL was {{designed}} for use in mobile computers. It was produced between November 1992 and June 1993. Clock speeds available were 20, 25 and 33 MHz. The i486SL contained all features of the i486DX.|$|R
50|$|EDK2 Application Development Kit (EADK) {{makes it}} {{possible}} to use standard C library functions in UEFI applications. EADK can be freely downloaded from <b>the</b> <b>Intel's</b> TianoCore UDK2010 / EDK2 SourceForge project. As an example, a port of the Python interpreter is made available as a UEFI application by using the EADK.|$|R
50|$|Henry Wanjune Lin (born 1995) is an American {{student who}} won <b>the</b> $50,000 <b>Intel</b> Young Scientist award, the second-highest award at <b>the</b> 2013 <b>Intel</b> Science and Engineering Fair {{for his work}} with MIT {{professor}} Michael McDonald on simulations of galaxy clusters. In 2015, he was named one of Forbes' 30 under 30 scientists.|$|R
25|$|While which {{specific}} {{system is}} considered the first microcomputer {{is a matter of}} debate, as there were several unique hobbyist systems developed based on <b>the</b> <b>Intel</b> 4004 and its successor, <b>the</b> <b>Intel</b> 8008, the first commercially available microcomputer kit was <b>the</b> <b>Intel</b> 8080-based Altair 8800, which was announced in the January 1975 cover article of Popular Electronics. However, this was an extremely limited system in its initial stages, having only 256 bytes of DRAM in its initial package and no input-output except its toggle switches and LED register display. Despite this, it was initially surprisingly popular, with several hundred sales in the first year, and demand rapidly outstripped supply. Several early third-party vendors such as Cromemco and Processor Technology soon began supplying additional S-100 bus hardware for the Altair 8800.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Mission had {{its first}} ever Intel STS finalist. In 2008, Mission sent two {{students}} to <b>the</b> <b>Intel</b> International Science and Engineering Fair, {{as they had}} won Grand Prize at the local San Francisco Bay Area Science Fair (SFBASF). In 2011, Mission again sent a student to <b>the</b> <b>Intel</b> International Science and Engineering Fair after that student's Grand Prize award at the local SFBASF. Mission has also had a consistent showing in the Siemens Competition, the best years being 2007 and 2011, with four semifinalists each.
