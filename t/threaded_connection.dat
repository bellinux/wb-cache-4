40|$|Abstract. Screw <b>thread</b> <b>connection</b> is {{a common}} way of {{detachable}} connection. The invalidation of screw <b>thread</b> <b>connection</b> will lead to mechanical failure or even retirement. Vibration tapping is essentially a kind of high-energy impact cutting which increases the rigidity of the tool. Composite vibration tapping simultaneously with repeated cutting action reduces the surface recovery of plastic materials and enhances metal cutting rate. Theoretical study and experimental results show that vibration tapping improves the metal cutting rates, enhances the machining accuracy and makes screw <b>thread</b> <b>connection</b> assembly easier. At the same time, vibration tapping process does not reduce the strength of screw thread. As the screw thread can be more uniformed cut at different depths, vibration tapping enhances the strength of screw thread slightly...|$|R

40|$|The modern {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} of America has seen most of the high quality, easily obtainable resources, already produced, thus causing wells to be drilled deeper in search for unconventional resources. This means Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG) must improve in order to withstand harsher conditions; especially the ability of connections to effectively create leak tight seals. This study investigates the use of <b>thread</b> <b>connections</b> in tight gas fields; therefore, an insight into their potential to contribute to fulfilling the energy demands is necessary. Also, a survey of completed projects done in tight gas fields can provide vital information that will establish the minimum requirements <b>thread</b> <b>connection</b> must meet to perform its functions. To make suitable adjustments to ensure safe and efficient operations we must thoroughly understand the many aspects of <b>thread</b> <b>connections.</b> To have this understanding, a review of previous works was carried out that highlights the capabilities and imitations of <b>thread</b> <b>connections.</b> In addition to reviewing previous work done on thread connections; this study measured the viscosity of thread compounds under variable conditions. It was found that viscosity of thread compound falls in the range of 285, 667 cP and 47, 758 cP when measured between 32. 9 degrees F and 121. 5 degrees F. This can be very important because thread compound is essential to the function of <b>thread</b> <b>connections.</b> The knowledge of its viscosity can help choose the most suitable compound. By knowing the value of the viscosity of a thread compound it {{can also be used to}} form an analytical assessment of the grooved plate method by providing a means to calculate a pressure gradient which impacts the leakage...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe fatigue {{assessment}} of bolts and bolted joints is done using nominal approach, {{for example the}} German VDI guideline 2230  . For threaded components, the nominal approach and therefore the guideline is no more applicable. The calculation of the fatigue strength of <b>threaded</b> <b>connections</b> according to the German FKM guideline “Analytical strength assessment for machine components” does not lead to satisfying solutions. So far, there is no procedure {{for the assessment of}} general <b>threaded</b> <b>connections.</b> Based on the mechanics of the local strain approach the paper shows a {{fatigue assessment}} of threaded components and general <b>threaded</b> <b>connections.</b> Prediction results are compared to own experimental data from tested bolt and nut connections in different nominal sizes, different strength categories and subjected to high and low mean stress. A simple model to describe the local cyclic creep as a function of stress amplitude is developed. Furthermore the phenomena related to transferability (size, stress gradients, multiaxiality, crack growth) are discussed...|$|R

This research aims to comprehend further the mechanism of the <b>thread</b> <b>connection</b> with respect to the depth of thread penetration. Tensile strength of <b>thread</b> <b>connection</b> was derived experimentally using two steel rods. The diameter of the first steel rod was Â¾ inch (18. 5 mm) and threaded on one end by 16 threads per inch. The diameter of the second steel rod was 45 mm and functioned as nut. From the results of the experiment, it can be concluded that rod failure will happen if the depth of thread penetration is equal to or bigger than 90 % of nut minor diameter. Meanwhile, thread failure will happen if the depth of thread penetration is less than 90 % of nut minor diameter. It is also shown that the correlation between the number of thread and the maximum load which can be supported by the connection is not linear...|$|R

Bailers are attached either via <b>threaded</b> <b>connection</b> or releasable downhole tool to the wireline toolstring, and are manipulated from surface by the wireline operator.

5000|$|Stem {{essentially}} just {{serves to}} add {{weight to the}} toolstring. The weight {{may be necessary to}} overcome the pressure of the well. Some variations of stem, called roller stem, may have wheels built into the tool to allow the tool string to glide more easily down moderately deviated wells. Stem give the hammering action to the tool string which in turn allows the jars to transmit the force given by the movement of the stems bars. Depending on well conditions extra small OD stems are use or extra large. The range can be from [...]75" [...] to 3.50" [...] OD and the stems normally come in 2 ft, 3 ft or 5 ft lengths. The connection to the rope socket or other tools can be a <b>threaded</b> <b>connection</b> or a QLS system (quick connect).|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic jars for {{slickline}} {{are generally}} meant to jar up only, because not enough sinker bar {{is able to}} feasibly be lubricated in to jar down on the downhole tools. Hydraulic jars work by the operator pulling up on the line, which puts an upward force {{on the top of}} the hydraulic jars. The bottom of the hydraulic jars is usually attached by <b>threaded</b> <b>connection</b> to the mechanical jars, which are attached to the downhole tools. Depending on how hard the operator pulls on the hydraulic jars will affect how fast they hit, and how hard they hit. When the top is pulled on, the inner mandrel begins to slide upwards. It has a restriction in it that hydraulic fluid has to bypass as it is pulled upwards, until it reaches an area of no restriction, allowing it to slide rapidly. The reason for the initial tighter restriction is to allow the operator to pull his line to the desired hitting range.|$|E
5000|$|The heavy, lower {{piece of}} the cue is the cue butt, and the smaller, {{narrower}} end is the shaft. The two cue pieces are attached at the joint; normally a screw rising from butt end's joint (male) is threaded into a receptacle on the shaft (female), or vice versa. The joints are made of various materials, most frequently a plastic, brass, stainless steel, or wood outer layer, but some custom cues are made of bone, antlers, or other more expensive materials that are less common, but serve the same effect. Most snooker cues have brass-to-brass joints. The internal male and female connection points are almost always brass or steel because they respond less to temperature changes and thus expand and contract less than other materials, preserving {{the life of the}} cue. Joints have different sizes as well as different male and female ends on the shaft and butts of the cues. Traditional designs employ a fully <b>threaded</b> <b>connection,</b> while newer versions (marketed under such names as Uni-loc, Accu-loc, Speed-loc, and Tru-loc) employ half-threaded [...] "quick pin release" [...] connections that allow players to assemble and disassemble their cues faster.|$|E

The method is based on a mechanical analysis performed either with finite elements or a closed-form solution described in a companion paper, and a fatigue analysis using the Dang Van criterion which has been extended to finite life domain. The mechanical analysis provides the stabilized stress path and the fatigue analysis provides the fatigue life. Fatigue tests have been performed on small scale <b>threaded</b> <b>connections</b> in order to validate the methodology. The comparisons with the predictions show the difficulties to estimate the fatigue life on structures presenting high stress gradient due to scale effects...|$|R

5000|$|The user {{attaches}} a hose to {{the fire}} hydrant, then opens a valve on the hydrant to provide a powerful flow of water, {{on the order of}} 350 kPa (50 pounds per square inch gauge (psig)) (this pressure varies according to region and depends on various factors including the size and location of the attached water main). This user can attach this hose to a fire engine, which can use a powerful pump to boost the water pressure and possibly split it into multiple streams. One may connect the hose with a <b>threaded</b> <b>connection,</b> instantaneous [...] "quick connector" [...] or a Storz connector. A user should take care not to open or close a fire hydrant too quickly, as this can cause a water hammer, which can damage nearby pipes and equipment. The water inside a charged hose line causes it to be very heavy and high water pressure causes it to be stiff and unable to make a tight turn while pressurized. When a fire hydrant is unobstructed, this is not a problem, as there is enough room to adequately position the hose.|$|E
50|$|These {{tools are}} {{primarily}} used to 'set' plugs into locking profiles (nipples) {{located in the}} tubing; however, the term 'running tool' refers to a downhole tool attached to the wireline toolstring {{that is used to}} 'run' another tool that is meant to be left downhole when the toolstring returns to surface. In general, a running tool is attached to a downhole 'locking tool' that locates and locks into the selected downhole profile (nipple). The 'locking tool', or 'lock' for short, can be attached via <b>threaded</b> <b>connection</b> {{to the top of a}} variety of different tools, including but not limited to, downhole chokes (flow rate restrictors sized according to a pre-determined calculation), one-way check valves (TKX style plugs), instrument hangers, and most commonly, tubing plugs. The lock is fitted onto the running tool and attached using shear pins made of brass or steel. When the target profile is reached the lock can be set by seating the lock into the profile using mechanical jars (spangs) until the locking keys have locked the lock into the profile, whereupon the operator usually 'pull tests' the lock to give an indication it is properly 'set', then shears off the shear pins with his mechanical or hydraulic jars to allow the 'toolstring' to return to surface. There are many different types of running tools, some are mechanically complex and able to be made 'selective' in order to pass through profiles in order to reach one of the same size but a different depth; some are relatively simple, such as an 'F' collarstop running tool, which is essentially a metal rod which fits inside the collarstop downhole tool which is pinned in place.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{environment}} and load condition of tubing is severe in high pressure wells. The sealability and joint strength of tubing string {{plays an important}} role in production operation. In this study, the makeup, sealability and joint strength was analyzed from conditions of make-up loading, tension loading, compression loading and internal pressure loading by finite element method. The makeup torque, the contact pressure distributions of metal seal along the axis and the stress distributions of <b>threaded</b> <b>connection</b> are given. The results show that under tension loading, compression loading and internal pressure, the overall stress level of <b>threaded</b> <b>connection</b> is lower than of pipe. The anti-compression performance and joint strength of <b>threaded</b> <b>connection</b> is greater than of pipe. The contact pressures of metal seal maintain relatively high level of contact pressures under tension loading, compression loading and internal pressure.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a {{comprehensive}} usable engineering design approach to the fatigue analysis of <b>threaded</b> <b>connections.</b> Although primarily concerned with the fatigue-fracture mechanics behaviour of screw threads, a broad review of stress analysis investigations in such connections is reported. Connection types, their functions and standardisation authorities are presented {{with the purpose of}} familiarising the reader with the subject and the options available to the design of threaded fasteners. Fatigue crack initiation is discussed with reference to the specific setting of a critical thread root. A crack initiation model is adapted for employment in thread root design. A novel weight function approach is developed for use in the determination of stress intensity factors for <b>threaded</b> <b>connections.</b> A generic solution is proposed valid for the fatigue crack growth from any thread root under any symmetrical stress system. Its development and discussion is examined in detail, remaining close to its proposed application. Two engineering situations where the chief structural components are comprised of threaded members are taken as case studies. The background to each situation is elaborated in detail and full-scale fatigue tests were conducted on the critical components. In all, fourteen full-scale tests under constant and variable amplitude loading are reported. The results of these are analysed and used to validate the fatigue crack initiation and propagation models. Useful observations which are helpful to understanding the fracture mechanisms operating during the fatigue of <b>threaded</b> <b>connections</b> are reported. Material and environmental considerations are examined and a survey of relevant materials and their behaviour in environments associated with threaded fasteners is presented. The merits or otherwise of some common engineering practices are discussed with regard to fatigue. A method has been developed for predicting fatigue life in large <b>threaded</b> <b>connections</b> under random loading. Experimental results have been gathered on two types of components used on certain oil rigs, tether joints and drill strings.
