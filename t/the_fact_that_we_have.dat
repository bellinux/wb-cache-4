25|$|It {{has been}} argued by some physicists, e.g., M. J. Duff, that {{the laws of physics}} are {{inherently}} dimensionless. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> assigned incompatible dimensions to Length, Time and Mass is, according to this point of view, just a matter of convention, borne out of the fact that before the advent of modern physics, {{there was no way to}} relate mass, length, and time to each other. The three independent dimensionful constants: c, ħ, and G, in the fundamental equations of physics must then be seen as mere conversion factors to convert Mass, Time and Length into each other.|$|E

The development of submarines, for example, can be traced via underwater archaeological research, via the Hunley, which was the first submarine to sink an enemy ship (Hunley also had unique construction details not found in previous vessels {{and was one of the}} few historic warships ever raised intact); the Resurgam II, the first powered submarine; and Holland 5, which provides insight into the development of submarines in the British Navy.|$|E

500|$|Max Mosley, the {{president}} of the FIA, also responded to Schumacher's comments saying that his comments [...] "reflect poorly on the sport and show a lack of adult attitude". Mosley also commented on the weight issue surrounding Schumacher saying that [...] "it is a pity that it became a matter for public discussion, whether he drank a huge amount of water, didn't go to the loo or had a heavy helmet. It is just a pity he didn't take care that it didn't happen". Elf was also unhappy with {{the way in which the}} episode had been handled, the company's Commercial Director Michel Bonnet declaring that [...] "We believe the FIA acted in a high-handed manner in disqualifying our two cars so quickly. It should have declared the results provisional and waited for the results of further analysis. Acting the way it did, the FIA has affected the image of large industrial companies, of top F1 teams and of famous drivers. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been treated as cheats by a red team – probably red with embarrassment at having finished one lap behind our cars – and by Gerhard Berger is a serious slur against us." [...] Elf also threatened to take the matter to a tribunal if the cars were not reinstated. Company representative Valerie Jorquera also highlighted the need for a consistent chromatographic analysis of fuel samples, drawing attention to the fact that the samples provided during the event had been analysed by a different company than the reference sample, and that the differences may have been caused by the use of different analytical machines and methods. The incident was seen as unfortunate for the sport, which was trying to make a fresh start after several controversies the previous year. From the San Marino Grand Prix onwards, an FIA mobile fuel laboratory accompanied the teams to each event to permit more detailed testing at the track, in addition to ensuring consistency between events.|$|E

According to the ALF's code, any act that furthers the cause of animal liberation, where all reasonable precautions are taken not to harm human or non-human life, may be claimed as an ALF action, including acts of vandalism causing economic damage to their victims. American activist Rod Coronado said in 2006: [...] "One thing that I know that separates us from the people we are constantly accused of being—that is, terrorists, violent criminals—is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> harmed no one." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1897, {{the state}} celebrated its centennial of {{statehood}} (albeit one year late) {{with a great}} exposition in Nashville. The Tennessee Centennial Exposition was the ultimate expression of the Gilded Age in the Upper South—a showcase of industrial technology and exotic papier-mâché versions of the world's wonders. The Nashville Parthenon, a full-scale replica of Athens' Parthenon, was built in plaster, wood and brick. Rebuilt of concrete in the 1920s, it {{remains one of the}} city's attractions. During its six-month run at Centennial Park, the Exposition drew nearly two million visitors to see its dazzling monuments to the South's recovery.

2500|$|After {{the world}} record attempt, Dr. Wolfgang Schreiber, President of Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S, said “When we {{introduced}} the Vitesse, we established the top speed for open-top driving to be 375 km/h.

The stated purpose of the group was [...] "help us keep Israel-related entries on Wikipedia from becoming tainted by anti-Israel editors". In follow-up e-mails to his recruits, Ini emphasized the secrecy of the campaign: [...] "There is no need to advertise <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> these group discussions," [...] he wrote.

[...] Someone leaked four weeks' worth of communications from within Ini's organization, and the quotes weren't pretty. Describing the Wiki-campaign, a member of Ini's corps writes: [...] "We will go to war after we have built an army, [...] it, trained."
