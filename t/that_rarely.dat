5|$|Officials advised 95,000 {{citizens}} {{along the}} New Jersey coastline, an area <b>that</b> <b>rarely</b> experiences hurricanes, to evacuate. Cape May County—the most vulnerable {{part of the}} state and among the most susceptible in the entire country—would require 36 hours in 2005 to evacuate the 100,000 citizens and 900,000 tourists that were commonly present during busy summer weekends.|$|E
5|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is {{a spectrum of}} conditions caused by infection with the human {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience {{a brief period of}} influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors <b>that</b> <b>rarely</b> affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with weight loss.|$|E
5|$|North American red foxes, {{particularly}} those of northern Alaska, are the most valued for their fur, as they have guard hairs of a silky texture, which, after dressing, allow the wearer unrestricted mobility. Red foxes living in southern Alaska's coastal areas and the Aleutian Islands are an exception, as they have extremely coarse pelts <b>that</b> <b>rarely</b> exceed one-third {{of the price of}} their northern Alaskan cousins. Most European peltries have coarse-textured fur compared to North American varieties. The only exceptions are the Nordic and Far Eastern Russian peltries, but they are still inferior to North American peltries in terms of silkiness.|$|E

5|$|Unlike some MMORPGs, {{there is}} very little focus on player versus player (PvP) combat, instead the game {{revolves}} around player versus environment (PvE). There are numerous PvE activities and events for players to partake in, including instanced activities and shared spaces activities. Some instanced events include Dynamis, Salvage, Assault and Nyzul Isle, which involve anywhere between 6 and 64 players. These battle grounds give players a series of objectives to overcome or complete and enemies to defeat, generally within a certain time frame. Popular shared spaces activities include hunting Notorious Monsters, fiends <b>that</b> <b>rarely</b> appear and drop precious loot.|$|E
25|$|The {{desire for}} {{intimacy}} has biological roots and, {{in the great}} majority of people, persists from birth until death. The desire for intimacy also has important implications for attachment. Relationships that frequently satisfy the desire for intimacy lead to more secure attachments. Relationships <b>that</b> <b>rarely</b> satisfy the desire for intimacy lead to less secure attachments.|$|E

25|$|The only {{substantial}} hoard of English coins {{from this}} period was found at Crondall, and included 69 English tremisses {{as well as a}} number of Frankish tremisses, probably deposited around 630. These and other finds reveal a range of types <b>that</b> <b>rarely</b> name a mint or issuing authority, though one scarce type bears the name of London, and others are struck in the name of King Eadbald of Kent (616–40). In terms of design they are based on Roman and Merovingian prototypes.|$|E
25|$|Little {{variation}} occurs {{among individuals}} of P. dominula; the wing lengths of males range from 9.5 to 13.0mm, while those of females range from 8.5 to 12.0mm. Its body is colored entirely yellow and black, {{similar to that}} of Vespula germanica, {{one of the most common}} and aggressive wasps in its native range. The female mandible is black and sometimes has a yellow spot. Females have a black subantennal mark <b>that</b> <b>rarely</b> has a pair of small, yellow spots. The female vertex sometimes has a pair of small, yellow spots behind the hind ocelli. Females have yellow, comma-shaped scutal spots.|$|E
25|$|Croydon {{features}} many of {{the inner}} west's most sought-after addresses due to its grand homes, larger blocks and family friendly streetscapes. As of 2011, the majority of dwellings were separate houses (63.6%). Croydon is a quiet village-like suburb with mostly detached housing built {{in the early part}} of the 20th century in what is known as Federation Bungalow or California Bungalow styles. The suburb caters for first-home buyers, while the wealthy may also find homes in the Malvern Hill Estate, a well-established pocket of prestigious homes <b>that</b> <b>rarely</b> come on the market and sell for more than $900,000. As of January 2016, the median house price of Croydon stood at $1,435,000.|$|E

25|$|After {{several years}} of development, their first product was {{released}} in 1976 as the Cray-1. As with earlier Cray designs, the Cray-1 made sure that the entire computer was fast, {{as opposed to just}} the processor. When it was released it easily beat almost every machine in terms of speed, including the STAR-100 that had beaten the 8600 for funding. The only machine able to perform on the same sort of level was the ILLIAC IV, a specialized one-off machine <b>that</b> <b>rarely</b> operated near its maximum performance, except on very specific tasks. In general, the Cray-1 beat anything on the market by a wide margin.|$|E
25|$|Aging Gonzaga {{gradually}} {{became more and}} more dissatisfied with his work, that of producing ephemeral follies <b>that</b> <b>rarely</b> lasted longer than a single theatrical season. He suffered depression, feeling that his life was spent in vain, and begged his patrons to offer him a chance to prove himself in architecture and leave a tangible trace of his talent. He applied to all available vacancies and architectural contests, and was always rejected. By 1827, when emperor Nicholas awarded him an honorary title of court architect Gonzaga was already too old for practical construction. Nestor Kukolnik suggested that earlier, in 1810s, Gonzaga designed and built Yusupov's private theatre in Arkhangelskoye Estate, but his attribution was later discarded.|$|E
25|$|Intel Corporation saw {{the massive}} {{potential}} of the invention and introduced the first commercial NOR type flash chip in 1988. NOR-based flash has long erase and write times, but provides full address and data buses, allowing random access to any memory location. This makes it a suitable replacement for older read-only memory (ROM) chips, which are used to store program code <b>that</b> <b>rarely</b> needs to be updated, such as a computer's BIOS or the firmware of set-top boxes. Its endurance may be from as little as 100 erase cycles for an on-chip flash memory, to a more typical 10,000 or 100,000 erase cycles, up to 1,000,000 erase cycles. NOR-based flash was the basis of early flash-based removable media; CompactFlash was originally based on it, though later cards moved to less expensive NANDflash.|$|E

25|$|Mount Dajt is a {{mountain}} and {{national park in}} Tirana County, {{to the east of}} Tirana. Its highest peak is at 1,613 m (5,292 ft). In winter, the mountain is often covered with snow, and it is a popular retreat to the local population of Tirana <b>that</b> <b>rarely</b> sees snow falls. Its slopes have forests of pines, oak and beech, while its interior contains canyons, waterfalls, caves, a lake, and an ancient castle. In addition to the forests and beautiful mountain landscapes with many wild flowers, numerous mammals are protected as well. In the park there exist wild boar, eurasian wolf, red fox, European hare, brown bears and wildcats. In {{the lower part of the}} mountains the vegetation is scrub determined with much heath, myrtle and fragaria. Oak dominates at around the 1,000 metres altitude zone following with beech forests with some conifers. Perched on the top there is almost no vegetation.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 2 October, the {{division}} crossed back to the right bank of the Volga in Stalingrad and reached the Mokraya Mechyotka river, immediately going into combat. The intensity of the fighting can be gauged from the memoirs of a surgeon in the division, M.F. Gulyakin. Gulyakin reports <b>that</b> <b>rarely</b> were there less than 200 wounded troops per day. By 14 October {{the remnants of the}} division were surrounded in the workshops of the Stalingrad Tractor Factory. The 14th Panzer Division broke through parts of the division's lines and reached the Volga. During {{the night of}} 16–17 October it was relieved by the 138th Rifle Division and sent to the Barrikady Factory, where the division set up strongpoints. In the middle of November, the division transferred to the left bank of the Volga, leaving in Stalingrad a combined unit based on the 118th Guards Rifle Regiment, subordinated to the 138th Rifle Division. After a few days, the combined unit was withdrawn due to heavy losses. The division was almost completely destroyed in the fighting for the Stalingrad Tractor Factory. Losses amounted to 95% of division personnel.|$|E

The canyon's main aquifers were too deep to be of use to ancient Chacoans: only several smaller and shallower sources supported the small springs that sustained them. Today, aside from occasional storm runoff coursing through arroyos, substantial surface water—springs, pools, wells—is virtually nonexistent.|$|E
