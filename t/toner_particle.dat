Toner is a powder; its early form was carbon powder, then melt-mixed with a polymer. The carrier particles have a coating which, during agitation, generates a triboelectric charge (a form of static electricity), which attracts a coating of toner particles. In addition, the mix is manipulated with a magnetic roller {{to present to the}} surface of the drum or belt a brush of toner. By contact with the carrier each neutral <b>toner</b> <b>particle</b> has an electric charge of polarity opposite to the charge of the latent image on the drum. The charge attracts toner to form a visible image on the drum. To control the amount of toner transferred, a bias voltage is applied to the developer roller to counteract the attraction between toner and latent image.|$|E

40|$|Non-polar {{electrical}} field flow fractionation (Np-EFFF) {{has been}} demonstrated to separate electrophotographic toner particles suspended in hydrocarbon medium according to the ratio of their diffusivities and their electrophoretic mobilities. While electrophoretic mobility has long been recognized as critical to the behavior of liquid toner particles in a development gap, the role of diffusivity has largely been ignored. Toner particles move in the development gap {{as a function of}} both parameters, and as <b>toner</b> <b>particle</b> size is reduced to achieve improvements in print quality, diffusivity becomes increasingly important.

40|$|Photoacoustic imaging (also called optoacoustic imaging) {{is a new}} hybrid imaging {{modality}} which offers tremendous potential for research and clinical applications and features main advantages of optical and acoustical techniques. It combines ultrasonic resolution with high optical contrast since signal generation is due to light absorption depending on the physiology of the examined biological tissue. The acoustic signal reports tissue-specific information about the local optical absorption. To increase the intrinsic contrast in tissue, plasmon-resonant gold nanostructures are of great interest for optical imaging because of their remarkable capacity to absorb and scatter light at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Together with optimized nanoscale contrast agents, optoacoustic techniques {{can be used for}} molecular imaging purposes in many application fields in biology and medicine. The aim of the work presented here is to establish a scalable photoacoustic technolog y for volume imaging of biological samples down to diffraction limited microscopy.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1996 Laser {{printers}} {{and copy}} machines produce an increasing quantity of difficult-to-recycle paper. In {{the last several}} years, {{the need for an}} effective process to de-ink the toner has prompted a number of facilities to try toner agglomeration. The method requires the use of small amounts of an appropriate oil which serves to collect the toner into agglomerates that can be removed from paper fibers by screens or centrifugal cleaners. The technique shows promise by being simple, economical, and often very effective; however, it currently requires high-temperature and performs inconsistently, preventing significant use. A fundamental study of agglomeration is needed to determine how it operates, the key variables and their interactions. Therefore, the present study provides a fundamental understanding of agglomeration, laying the groundwork for process enhancement. We identify the key factors in agglomeration: concentration of cationic starch released from sheets in the repulper, oil composition, agitation rate, time and temperature. Furthermore, we examine how and why each factor influences agglomeration, and a population balance model is developed to help determine the quantitative relationships between the key variables. Cationic starch adsorbs to toner and oil interfaces, rendering them electrosterically stable to coalescence, thus preventing oil drops from reaching <b>toner</b> <b>particle</b> surfaces. However, when the oil contains an oil-soluble surfactant, the cationic starch adlayer is engulfed and some agglomeration resumes. Direct and novel use of the atomic force microscope provides insight into the cationic starch-induced reduction in oil-toner collision efficiency. Agitation rate and temperature influence the particle breakup rate, the latter by increasing aggregate strength by fusing toners above 35 ∘C. The model effectively predicts the experimental results, and shows how the competition between aggregate growth and breakup determines both the rate and degree of agglomeration. The results yield the agglomeration mechanism, quantitative expressions relating key variables and performance, and practical suggestions...|$|E

40|$|Image {{quality and}} the {{mechanisms}} involved in digital dry toner electrophotography {{are influenced by the}} interactions between the printing machine, toner and paper in the last two steps where the paper is involved, i. e., in transferring the developed image toner to the paper, and in fusing the image to be fixed permanently on the paper surface. This study discusses the role of paper in these two steps in different technologies and its effect on the printing mechanisms and image quality. The control of optical, electrostatic and mass and heat transfer phenomena in the printing process are affected by the unevenness of the properties of paper due to its heterogeneous structure and its sensitivity to humidity conditions and printing process parameters. In this research, a set of experiments was conducted to understand the electrostatic behaviour of paper in toner transfer and thermal behaviour in toner fusing. The results show that not only image quality is affected by the variability of paper properties, but also the mechanisms of toner transfer and fusing. Accordingly, the research suggests that the paper should be included as part of the printing mechanism, performance (printability and runnability), and image quality. Consequently, if there is a change in paper properties due to a change in ambient conditions or the use of another grade for a specific application, the process parameters can be adjusted to compensate for these changes {{in order to meet the}} requirements for image quality. It was found that the variability in image quality in terms of colours (the requirement for different toner layers), grey scale (halftone structure) and the location of the image in the xy-plane is affected when rendered through the electrophotographic process. The fast mechanical speed in printing machine direction drives the toner transfer and fusing mechanisms differently from the cross machine direction. As a result, a certain image element such as a line will have different quality in these two printing directions, or if the line is placed in the length or width direction of the page. The conclusion was that the electrophotographic process should be designed to reduce or even to neglect the effect of paper when printing a high-quality colour image in a high-speed process. This can be achieved by eliminating the contact with paper from the image side in both transfer and fusing by adopting the technologies of toner jumping transfer and non-contact flash fusing. These technologies have special requirements for chemical and physical toner properties, such as modification for equal absorbance of the flash radiation by CMYK colours, a suitable melting viscosity and surface energy, and a small and narrow <b>toner</b> <b>particle</b> size and shape distribution to unify the charge-to-mass ratio of the toner, which is important for transfer quality and efficiency. To ensure high print quality for different applications, some of the transfer and fusing parameters need to be automatically adjusted according to substrate specific properties and levels of image coverage...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{document}}s, whether printed by laser printers, FAX, copier, typesetting, or typewriter, contain distortions.

The goal {{of this research is}} to create a mathematical model that is a representation of the distortion caused by the xerographic machines. The model can be used with the OCR to improve the character recognition. A mathematical model for the density of toner on paper that leads to the average coverage on paper was formulated. The density function represents the shape that the laser beam creates on the photoconductor. The intensity profile of the laser beam is a Gaussian distribution. The coverage equation has parameters that represent the number of <b>toner</b> <b>particles,</b> the size of tone particles, and the standard deviation of the spread of the <b>toner</b> <b>particles.</b> A simplistic document was created to measure the range of parameters in the coverage equation. A range of values corresponding to printed samples were measured and noted. Simulations that represented placing toner on paper were done using functions in the Matlab program.
