50|$|<b>Tar</b> <b>paper</b> is a {{heavy-duty}} paper used in construction. <b>Tar</b> <b>paper</b> {{is made by}} impregnating paper or fiberglass mat with tar, producing a waterproof material useful for roof construction. <b>Tar</b> <b>paper</b> is distinguished from roofing felt which is impregnated with asphalt instead of tar; but these two products are used the same way, and their names sometimes are used informally as synonyms.|$|R

50|$|Next to and {{downstream}} from the lock is a waterfront housing development, Sandford Mill. Built in the 1980s, this occupies {{the site of}} the former mill which closed on Christmas Eve 1982. Originally a corn mill belonging to the Abbey of Abingdon and recorded in 1100 as owned by the local monks for bread making, it came {{into the hands of the}} Knights Templars at the beginning of the 14th century. It was converted to a paper mill in 1826 in order to supply the increasing demands of the University of Oxford. The listed cottages upstream from the lock (now River View) that can be seen across the road from the old wharf were also built in 1826. Occupied by mill workers, they originally boasted flat roofs made of <b>tarred</b> <b>paper,</b> (a first in Britain). The millrace continues to flow under the footbridge that crosses from the King's Arms pub to the lock.|$|E
50|$|A {{few days}} after taking possession, the lumber and {{building}} materials for the station having been landed, Captain Healy sent his carpenters and {{a portion of his}} crew on shore and erected a substantial frame house, 20 by 60 feet in size. The supply of lumber, however, gave out before it was fully completed, so that it was not as comfortable for an Arctic winter as was intended. Before the completion of the frame building, Miner W. Bruce, the superintendent, had constructed a “dugout” for himself and assistant and another for the Siberian herders. These “ dugouts” were occupied during the severity of the winter weather. During the summer of 1893 additional lumber and material were sent to the station, and Healy again sent his carpenters and sailors on shore to do the needed work of placing the main station building in complete order for comfortable use. The whole house had double sides and double floor, with <b>tarred</b> <b>paper</b> between. A large “lean-to” was erected {{in the rear of the}} house for the use of the herders. Jackson's greatest success figured in the 1897 Overland Relief Expedition which saved marooned whalers near Point Barrow.|$|E

40|$|Marine borers, {{particularly}} the shipworms, as destroyers of timber, par excellence, {{are well known}} from very ancient times. They attacked the wooden hulls of ships with such intensity that the weakened bottom planks broke up even due to a mild impact caused by hitting a rock or any floating objects inducing shipwrecks. Even the survival of sunken ships as wrecks depends on the mercy of wood-destroying organisms, which may turn these ‘port-holes’ to history into meaningless junks. The silent saboteurs, involved in several early shipwrecks, are the molluscan and crustacean borers, aided by bacteria and fungi. This paper presents {{an account of the}} marine wood-borers, together with a historical review of literature on their depredation on wooden ships, and on protective methods adopted from antiquity to modern times. The seriousness with which early mariners faced the problem of bio-deterioration and the fear the wood-borers created in their minds have been brought to light with, in some cases, excerpts from their journals and books. The anxiety and concern for protecting the ships from the ravages of wood-borers and for their own safety, as evidenced from their accounts, are discussed. Classification of various groups of marine wood-borers with notes on characters of systematic value and a complete list of species so far recorded in literature have been included under Appendix I and II. Methods employed to prevent damage to the boats included deep-charring, coating with pitch, coal-tar, whale oil and mustard oil with lime; scupper nailing (‘filling’); sheathing with animal skin, hair, <b>tarred</b> <b>paper,</b> wooden boards (untreated or soaked in coal tar, Ferrous sulphate, Copper sulphate or Lead monoxide); sheathing with metals (Lead or Copper sheets); plastic, neoprene coated ply-woods; and painting with Copper oxide, Pentachlorophenol or phenylarsenious oxide. None of these imparts complete protection. Recent archaeological investigations carried out in British waters, especially on ‘Mary Rose’, are also summarised. It is suggested that, though borers are instrumental in inducing ship-wrecks thereby enriching the materials for archaeological studies, excavations at known ship-wreck sites should be augmented to unearth valuable historical data, before they are lost to satisfy the insatiable appetite of these pests...|$|E
