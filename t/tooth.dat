5|$|<b>Tooth</b> {{eruption}} may {{be altered}} by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the <b>tooth</b> {{is said to}} be impacted. The most common cause of <b>tooth</b> impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the <b>tooth.</b> Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. <b>Tooth</b> ankylosis occurs when the <b>tooth</b> has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary <b>tooth</b> instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists {{who wish to}} delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary <b>tooth</b> is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, the eruption of the permanent <b>tooth</b> will be delayed. Conversely, if {{the roots of the}} permanent <b>tooth</b> are more than ⅔ complete, the eruption of the permanent <b>tooth</b> will be accelerated. Between ⅓ and ⅔, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.|$|E
50|$|Many {{other terms}} to {{describe}} a reduction in number of <b>teeth</b> appear in the literature: aplasia of <b>teeth,</b> congenitally missing <b>teeth,</b> absence of <b>teeth,</b> agenesis of <b>teeth</b> and lack of <b>teeth.</b>|$|R

5|$|Crocodilians are polyphyodonts {{and able}} to replace each of their {{approximately}} 80 teeth up to 50 times in their 35 to 75-year lifespan. They are the only non-mammalian vertebrates with <b>tooth</b> sockets. Next to each full-grown <b>tooth</b> {{there is a small}} replacement <b>tooth</b> and an odontogenic stem cell in the dental lamina in standby, which can be activated when required. <b>Tooth</b> replacement slows significantly and eventually stops as the animal grows old.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Butler {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} computer tomography scans {{of the juvenile}} skull SAM-PK-K10487. To the surprise of these researchers, replacement teeth yet to erupt were present even in this early ontogenetic stage. Despite these findings, the authors argued that <b>tooth</b> replacement must have occurred since the juvenile displayed the same <b>tooth</b> morphology as adult individuals – this morphology would have changed if the <b>tooth</b> simply grew continuously. In conclusion, Butler and colleagues suggested that <b>tooth</b> replacement in Heterodontosaurus must have been more sporadic than in related dinosaurs. Unerupted replacement teeth in Heterodontosaurus were not discovered until 2011, when Norman and colleagues described the upper jaw of specimen SAM-PK-K1334. Another juvenile skull (AMNH 24000) described by Sereno in 2012 also yielded unerupted replacement teeth. As shown by these discoveries, <b>tooth</b> replacement in Heterodontosaurus was episodical and not continuous as in other heterodontosaurids. The unerupted teeth are triangular in lateral view, which is the typical <b>tooth</b> morphology in basal ornithischians. The characteristic chisel-like shape of the fully erupted teeth therefore resulted from tooth-to-tooth contact between the dentition of {{the upper and lower}} jaws.|$|E
5000|$|The succedaneous <b>teeth</b> are the {{permanent}} <b>teeth</b> that replace the deciduous <b>teeth</b> [...] Permanent molars are not succedaneous <b>teeth</b> {{because they do}} not replace any primary <b>teeth.</b> Succedaneous <b>teeth</b> originate from successional laminae whereas permanent molars originate from the general dental lamina.

5|$|One Ferugliotherium <b>tooth</b> {{is thought}} to be a first upper molariform (MF1). It is almost {{rectangular}} and bears three longitudinal rows of cusps. There are five cusps in the middle row, which is oriented obliquely, four cusps in one of the rows {{on the side of the}} <b>tooth,</b> and two or three in the other row on the side. As in the lower molariforms, the cusps are connected by transverse ridges and separated by furrows. LACM 149371, the enigmatic possibly ferugliotheriid <b>tooth</b> from Peru, is a triangular <b>tooth</b> bearing six or seven cusps, which are connected by crests and surround two deep fossae (basins) and a third shallower fossa.|$|E
5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted <b>tooth.</b> The lower wisdom <b>tooth</b> is the last <b>tooth</b> to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the <b>tooth</b> partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the <b>tooth.</b> Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom <b>tooth</b> also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing <b>tooth</b> to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the <b>tooth.</b> There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by <b>tooth</b> extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the <b>tooth</b> is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E
5|$|Reversible/irreversible pulpitis is a {{distinct}} concept from whether the <b>tooth</b> is restorable or unrestorable, e.g. a <b>tooth</b> may only have reversible pulpitis, but has been structurally weakened by decay or trauma {{to the point that}} it is impossible to restore the <b>tooth</b> in the long term.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Agenesis {{of one or}} more {{permanent}} <b>teeth</b> is a common developmental dental anomaly in human beings. In the literature, many terms are used to describe missing <b>teeth</b> like oligodontia, anodontia, aplasia of <b>teeth,</b> congenitally missing <b>teeth,</b> absence of <b>teeth,</b> agenesis of <b>teeth</b> and lack of <b>teeth.</b> The etiology of missing <b>teeth</b> may be environmental factors like infection, trauma, drugs, chemotherapy or radiotherapy or may be genetic. The most often missing permanent <b>teeth,</b> excluding third molars, are the second premolars and the lateral incisors. Here we report two cases of hypodontia of permanent <b>teeth</b> which are familial and without the presence of any syndrome. We have also reviewed literature of similar cases published till date...|$|R
40|$|The Mentawai {{ethnic group}} is {{accustomed}} {{to the practice of}} anterior <b>teeth</b> mutilation on males and females prior to reaching puberty age at Siberut Island, Mentawai Islands Regency, West Sumatra Province. Objective: of this research was to analyze the effects of anterior <b>teeth</b> mutilation on the <b>teeth</b> of the Mentawai ethnic, and prove that there is a correlation between anterior <b>teeth</b> mutilation and posterior <b>teeth</b> attritions. Material & method: There were 179 respondents who contributed to this study by applying accidental sampling method, consist of 96 respondents had anterior <b>teeth</b> mutilations and 83 non-mutilation respondents were found. Among respondents with anterior <b>teeth</b> mutilation, 53. 07 % of them had posterior <b>teeth</b> attritions. Only 0. 56 % of the respondent with anterior <b>teeth</b> mutilation did not have posterior <b>teeth</b> attrition. On the other hand, respondent without anterior <b>teeth</b> mutilation who got posterior <b>teeth</b> attritiona nd without posterior <b>teeth</b> attrition were almost similar (27. 93 % and 18. 44 %, respectively). Conclusion: the anterior <b>teeth</b> mutilation which is a ritual of Mentawai ethnic group and has been perfomred for generations, is significantly influent the occurrence of posterior <b>teeth</b> attrition.

5|$|Similar {{to other}} iguanodonts, {{the teeth of}} Eolambia are {{arranged}} in tightly-spaced and interlocking rows. At any given time, each of the 32 maxillary <b>tooth</b> sockets holds three teeth, while each of the 30 dentary <b>tooth</b> sockets holds four teeth. Out of these, two of the teeth in each socket are replacement teeth like those of Probactrosaurus; the others are active teeth. Rvery active <b>tooth</b> has one wear facet. Like Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, Protohadros, and other hadrosauroids, each maxillary <b>tooth</b> crown has only one ridge, which is slightly offset towards the midline of the mouth. Meanwhile, each dentary <b>tooth</b> crown characteristically bears a primary ridge, and an accessory ridge closer to the midline of the mouth, a condition which is also present in Protohadros and other hadrosauroids. All of the crowns also bear small, denticle-like serrations {{on the front and}} rear edges, which is also seen in Probactrosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{adductor}} muscle of the jaw {{appears to have}} attached to the quadrate instead of the supratemporal fenestra. Both this and the other mastication muscles were likely weak, and Nigersaurus is estimated to have {{had one of the}} weakest bites of the sauropods. In addition, the small, nearly parallel nature of the <b>tooth</b> scratches and pits (caused by grit, which would not be obtained as often by high-browsers) indicate that it ate relatively soft, herbaceous plants such as low-growing ferns. Because of the lateral orientation of the teeth, it probably {{would not have been able}} to chew. Nigersaurus wore its <b>tooth</b> crowns down faster than other dinosaurian herbivores, and its <b>tooth</b> replacement rate was the highest of any known dinosaur. Each <b>tooth</b> was replaced once every 14 days; the rate had previously been estimated lower. In contrast to Nigersaurus, sauropods with lower <b>tooth</b> replacement rates and broader <b>tooth</b> crowns are thought to have been canopy browsers.|$|E

25|$|Natal and {{neonatal}} <b>teeth</b> are {{an anomaly}} that involves <b>teeth</b> erupting in a newborn infant’s mouth earlier than usual. The incidence ranges from 1:2,000 to 1:3,500 births.

The most common location is the mandibular region of the central incisors. Natal <b>teeth</b> and neonatal <b>teeth</b> are associated with genetics, developmental abnormalities and certain recognized syndromes. Additional names for this condition include precocious dentition, baby <b>teeth,</b> and milk <b>teeth.</b>|$|R
5|$|The gingiva ("gums") is the mucosal {{tissue that}} {{overlays}} the jaws. There are three {{different types of}} epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the <b>tooth</b> and the mouth. The gingival epithelium is not associated directly with <b>tooth</b> attachment and is visible in the mouth. The junctional epithelium, composed of the basal lamina and hemidesmosomes, forms an attachment to the <b>tooth.</b> The sulcular epithelium is nonkeratinized stratified squamous tissue on the gingiva which touches but is not attached to the <b>tooth.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament is {{a specialized}} connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a <b>tooth</b> to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers {{the root of}} the <b>tooth</b> within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15–0.38mm, but this size decreases over time. The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the <b>tooth</b> to the bone, support for the <b>tooth,</b> formation and resorption of bone during <b>tooth</b> movement, sensation, and eruption. The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez. Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the <b>tooth</b> and forms a network around the <b>tooth</b> toward the crest of the gingiva. When pressure is exerted on a <b>tooth,</b> such as during chewing or biting, the <b>tooth</b> moves slightly in its socket and puts tension on the periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tooth</b> is {{recurved}} with {{a backward}} bend, and is oval in cross-section. Its {{front and back}} cutting edges are finely serrated, extending two-thirds down each edge. There are six denticles per millimeter (0.04in), and each denticle is square and chiseled. The overall form of the <b>tooth,</b> its width and shape in cross-section and its curvature resemble those in the maxilla (upper jawbone) and mandible of the species Dromaeosaurus albertensis from North America. Blood grooves are indistinct or absent, also similar to Dromaeosaurus, and differing {{from members of the}} Velociraptorinae subfamily. Dromaeosauroides differs from Dromaeosaurus in that the cutting edge at the front side is further {{from the middle of the}} <b>tooth.</b> Although the <b>tooth</b> is larger and the denticles similar, each denticle was smaller than those of Dromaeosaurus, which had only 13–20 denticles per , instead of Dromaeosauroides 30.

5|$|<b>Tooth</b> {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} <b>tooth</b> structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of <b>tooth</b> structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of <b>tooth</b> loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the <b>tooth.</b> A common source of this type of <b>tooth</b> wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of <b>tooth</b> structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of <b>tooth</b> destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of <b>tooth</b> structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} <b>tooth</b> and compression on the other side of the <b>tooth.</b> This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When <b>tooth</b> destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tooth</b> {{development}} is commonly divided {{into the following}} stages: the bud stage, the cap, the bell, and finally maturation. The staging of <b>tooth</b> {{development is}} an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently it is difficult to decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing <b>tooth.</b> This determination is further complicated by the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing <b>tooth,</b> which can appear to be different stages.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tooth</b> {{eruption}} {{in humans}} {{is a process}} in <b>tooth</b> development in which the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Current research indicates that the periodontal ligaments {{play an important role}} in <b>tooth</b> eruption. Primary teeth erupt into the mouth from around six months until two years of age. These teeth are the only ones in the mouth until a person is about six years old. At that time, the first permanent <b>tooth</b> erupts. This stage, during which a person has a combination of primary and permanent teeth, is known as the mixed stage. The mixed stage lasts until the last primary <b>tooth</b> is lost and the remaining permanent teeth erupt into the mouth.|$|E
