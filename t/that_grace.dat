5|$|Although officially {{designated}} a tropical cyclone by the NHC, Météo-France, the French meteorological service, stated in their annual {{report to the}} World Meteorological Organization <b>that</b> <b>Grace</b> {{should not have been}} classified a tropical system. In their report, they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60mph (95km/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, Météo-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC of warning upon this system based on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity.|$|E
5|$|During the reception, Grace learns {{many things}} {{she did not}} know about Leo, {{including}} that his first name is Marvin (revealed by his mother, Eleanor (Judith Ivey)). So many unsettling details about Leo come to light <b>that</b> <b>Grace</b> becomes uneasy and leaves the reception; Leo follows her. The two run into Katie in the lobby who tells them that The Today Show has scrapped the wedding segment because the judge who performed the ceremony was not licensed in New York so their marriage is not valid.

Believing <b>that</b> <b>Grace</b> might be suicidal, Will leaves to attend to her. Vince shows up at Will and Grace's apartment to confront her, telling her that she is affecting his relationship with Will because she is too needy.

The episode concludes with him telling Vince {{that he wants to}} work things out, but before they can discuss it, Vince sees Grace's wedding album, resulting in him being more focused on the album than the relationship.|$|E

25|$|Scholars' {{conclusions}} about El Greco's aesthetics are mainly {{based on the}} notes El Greco inscribed {{in the margins of}} two books in his library.

But the painter achieves grace only if he manages to solve the most complex problems with obvious ease.|$|E

25|$|Traces of the {{ascendancy}} of the Crown of Aragon in the Mediterranean, and Spanish governance over Malta from 1282 to 1530, are still evident in Maltese culture today.

25|$|Having {{turned down}} the chance of going to Oxford University in 1866, Grace did the same when {{approached}} by Cambridge University in 1868.

25|$|Like other Christian churches, Pentecostals {{believe that}} certain rituals or ceremonies were instituted as a pattern and command by Jesus in the New Testament.

Instead the term sacerdotal ordinance is used to denote the distinctive belief <b>that</b> <b>grace</b> is received directly from God by the congregant with the officiant serving only to facilitate rather than acting as a conduit or vicar.|$|E
