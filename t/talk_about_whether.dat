[...] In his interview with the magazine, after declining to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> he was dating Taylor Swift, the magazine pressed Lautner on rumors of him being homosexual, which he brushed off. Brent Hartinger, a columnist for AfterElton, blasted the magazine, calling the questioning [...] "unimaginably irresponsible," [...] commenting that Lautner was just [...] "a 17-year old kid" [...] and that while the rumors were baseless and speculation from certain blogs and fans, it was disappointing that a [...] "legitimate media outlet" [...] would print gossip. Hartinger said the magazine reached a [...] "new low" [...] and did not have common decency, noting that the line between child and adult [...] "is there for a good reason".|$|E
