Two cases of progressive deformation behaviour are discussed for different loading methods. The aim of the first case is to recognize the shakedown behaviour of the cylinder under applied loading cycles. Alternatively, second case is highlighting the ratchetting behaviour of the cylinder. Based on the loading method in second case, a smooth thin hollow cylinder is considered to simulate the progressive deformation.

These property models {{are needed to}} simulate the mechanical behavior of structures with copper components that are subjected to high heat flux and fatigue loading conditions, such as molds for the continuous casting of steel and the first wall in a fusion reactor. Then, measurements of four-point bending fatigue tests were conducted on two-layered specimens of copper alloy and stainless steel, and <b>thermal</b> <b>ratchetting</b> behavior was observed at 250 °C. The test specimens were modeled with a two-dimensional elastic-plastic-creep finite-element model using ABAQUS. To match the measurements, a primary thermal creep law was developed for Cu- 0. 28 % Al 2 O 3 for stress levels up to 500 MPa, and strain rates from 10 – 8 – 10 – 2 s- 1.

Such material behavior is known to strongly influence structural response under some important thermomechanical loadings, for example, that involving <b>thermal</b> <b>ratchetting.</b> The influence of dynamic and thermal recovery on the creep buckling of a column under variable loading is investigated. The column is taken as the idealized (Shanley) sandwich column. The constitutive model, unlike the commonly employed Norton creep model, incorporates a representation of both dynamic and thermal (state) recovery. The material parameters of the constitutive model are chosen to characterize Narloy Z, a representative copper alloy used in thrust nozzle liners of reusable rocket engines. Variable loading histories include rapid cyclic unloading/reloading sequences and intermittent reductions of load for extended periods of time; these are superimposed on a constant load. The calculated results show that state recovery significantly affects creep buckling under variable loading.

40|$|Today, we find an {{increasing}} interest in Brownian motors - theoretical "thermal ratchets" that rectify random motion to do work. This interest stems {{not only from}} possible applications to cellular transport mechanisms and nanoscale mechanics but from the more intricate understanding of entropy and non-equilibrium dynamics they offer. In an attempt to bring Brownian motors {{one step closer to}} reality, the primary goal {{of this paper is to}} propose an experimental realization of an (electronic) <b>thermal</b> <b>ratchet</b> and predict its behavior numerically; with a secondary goal of exploring the practicality and properties of this ratchet and putting this research in the context of existing <b>thermal</b> <b>ratchet</b> work. To these ends, we present a general discussion of non-equilibrium dynamics and the stateof- the-art in <b>thermal</b> <b>ratchet</b> research. Following this, we explain the electronic ratchet, a diode and resistor in parallel where the diode rectifies the Nyquist noise across the resistor, in detail. Finally, we determine that an experimental electronic ratchet using off-the-shelf components can exhibit a measurable voltage difference 14. 5 pV / 0 K, which could confirm this effect experimentally. We also show that this effect is independent of the Seebeck effect, meaning that there are unlikely to be any other "antagonistic" thermoelectric effects to muddle any experimental results...|$|R

Using particle-based, mesoscopic simulations that maintain local momentum conservation, we analyze quantitatively how the coupling to the surrounding fluid affects ratchet motion. We find that coupling can increase the mean velocity of the moving particles by almost two orders of magnitude, precisely because ratchet motion has both a diffusive and a deterministic component. The resulting coupling also leads {{to the formation of}} aggregates at longer times.

40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>ratcheting</b> is a {{critical}} phenomenon associated with the cyclic operation of dual-medium thermocline tanks in solar energy applications. Although <b>thermal</b> <b>ratcheting</b> poses a serious impediment to thermocline operation, this failure mode in dual-medium thermocline tanks is not yet well understood. To study {{the potential for the}} occurrence of ratcheting, a comprehensive model of a thermocline tank that includes both the heterogeneous filler region as well as the composite tank wall is formulated. The filler region consists of a rock bed with interstitial molten salt, while the tank wall is composed of a steel shell with two layers of insulation (firebrick and ceramic). The model accounts separately for the rock and molten-salt regions in view of their different thermal properties. Various heat loss conditions are applied at the external tank surface to evaluate the effect of energy losses to the surroundings. Hoop stresses, which are governed by the magnitude of temperature fluctuations, are determined through both a detailed finite-element analysis and simple strain relations. The two methods are found to yield almost identical results. Temperature fluctuations are damped by heat losses to the surroundings, leading to a reduction in hoop stresses with increased heat losses. Failure is prevented when the peak hoop stress is less than the material yield strength of the steel shell. To avoid ratcheting without incurring excessive energy loss, insulation between the steel shell and the filler region should be maximized.

The motor proteins, such as myosin or kinesin, act as the energy transducer in our lives, i. e., they produce mechanical work as they consume chemical energy. Motivated by such systems various phenomenological models have recently been proposed.

The use of a phase change material (PCM) is attractive because of the higher energy storage density which can be achieved. However, the use of PCM has also certain disadvantages which must be addressed.

40|$|Molten-salt {{thermocline}} {{tanks are}} a low-cost option for {{thermal energy storage}} in concentrating solar power systems. A review of previous experimental and numerical thermocline tank studies is performed to identify key issues associated with tank design and performance. Published models have shown that tank discharge performance improves with both larger tank height and smaller internal filler diameter due to increased thermal stratification and sustained outflow of molten salt with high thermal quality. For well-insulated (adiabatic) tanks, low molten-salt flow rates reduce the axial extent of the heat-exchange region and increase discharge efficiency. Under nonadiabatic conditions, low flow rates become detrimental to stratification due {{to the development of}} fluid recirculation zones inside the tank. For such tanks, higher flow rates reduce molten-salt residence time inside the tank and improve discharge efficiency. Despite the economic advantages of a thermocline tank, <b>thermal</b> <b>ratcheting</b> of the tank wall remains a significant design concern. The potential for <b>thermal</b> <b>ratcheting</b> is reduced through the inclusion of an internal thermal insulation layer between the molten salt and tank wall to diminish temperature oscillations along the tank wall. Future research directions are also pointed out, including combined analyses that consider the solar receiver and power generation blocks as well as optimization between performance and economic considerations...|$|R

40|$|Design of {{components}} against incremental deformation or “ratcheting ” under cyclic loading conditions is addressed in Article NB- 3200 of Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The ratcheting rules, {{based on the}} Bree diagram, relate primary stress and secondary stress ranges that are calculated elastically and aim to approximate elastic-plastic material behaviors under cyclic loading. The Bree diagram was developed for cases with through-thickness thermal bending and constant primary membrane stress. It {{does not account for}} high thermal membrane stress that can occur near gross structural or thermal discontinuities. Cyclic thermal membrane stress combined with sustained stress can lead to ratcheting that is not accounted for in the current design rules. This paper discusses the validation of proposed criteria for evaluating <b>thermal</b> stress <b>ratcheting</b> under high <b>thermal</b> membrane stress using an elastic analysis. These proposed criteria are confirmed by an analysis of a nozzle that is attached by a partial penetration weld to a vessel head and subjected to severe thermal cycling. Linearized stresses from an elastic analysis under pressure and thermal loadings typical for a nuclear power plant are compared to limits in NB- 3200 for <b>thermal</b> stress <b>ratcheting.</b> Additionally, an elastic-perfectly plastic analysis is used to evaluate if the component will shakedown.
