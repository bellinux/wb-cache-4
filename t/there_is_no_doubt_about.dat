Its effects are recorded at Rome, Sicily, Spain, and in Africaindeed, Maximian encouraged particularly strict enforcement of the edict in Africa. Africa's political elite were insistent that the persecution be fulfilled, and Africa's Christians, especially in Numidia, were equally insistent on resisting them. For the Numidians, to hand over scriptures was an act of terrible apostasy. Africa had long been home to the Church of the Martyrsin Africa, martyrs held more religious authority than the clergyand harbored a particularly intransigent, fanatical, and legalistic variety of Christianity. It was Africa that gave the West most of its martyrdoms.|$|E

25|$|The Dacians {{knew about}} writing. Permanent {{contacts}} with the Graeco-Roman world had brought {{the use of the}} Greek and later the Latin alphabet. It is also certainly not the case that writing with Greek and Latin letters and knowledge of Greek and Latin were known in all the settlements scattered throughout Dacia, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> the existence of such knowledge in some circles of Dacian society. However, the most revealing discoveries concerning the use of the writing by the Dacians occurred in the citadels on the Sebes mountains. Some groups of letters from stone blocks at Sarmisegetuza might express personal names; these can not now be read because the wall is ruined, and because it is impossible to restore the original order of the blocks in the wall.|$|E

500|$|An {{article on}} the historicity of the Icelandic sagas notes that [...] "Brodir" [...] is not a Norse proper name at all, and is itself derived from the Irish name {{variously}} written as Bruattar, Bruadar or Brodur. According to the article, the name first appears in the Annals of Ulster in the year 853, when a princeling of south-east Ireland named Bruattar mac Aeda {{was involved in the}} murder of a rival before being slain himself. The name only appears in Norse context twice — at the Battle of Clontarf, and in 1160 for the King of Dublin, Brodar mac Torcaill — and had a longer circulation in Irish literature. The same article also suggests that while <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> the historical truth of the Battle of Clontarf, the name [...] "Ospakr", along with other names in the Njál's saga account of the Clontarf episode, may have been borrowed from the Landnámabók.|$|E

500|$|As of July 1989 about $500 {{million in}} {{donations}} had been {{delivered to the}} Armenians from 113 countries. Most of those funds went into the initial relief work and medical care plus the beginning portion of the rebuilding phase. Yuri S. Mkhitarian, an Armenian State Building Committee official, gave an updated damage report that included some of the outlying communities away from the population centers stating that 342 villages were damaged and another 58 were destroyed. The negative effect the earthquake had on the economy of Armenia was apparent. Mkhitarian said that 130 factories were destroyed and 170,000 people were out of work. Officials acknowledged that the work to complete the rebuilding may take {{up to five years}} or longer, a supposition that more than doubled Gorbachev's estimate of two years. At that time 20 projects had completed the planning process and some had been approved and construction started. In Leninakan there was a need for 18 new hospitals, 12 of which could be funded {{with the assistance of the}} republics of the Soviet Union, but foreign help would be required to build six additional facilities. Boris Karapetyan, director of earthquake studies at the Yerevan Polytechnical Institute, said of the difficult rebuilding process [...] "Coordination is a major, major problem. This is a massive undertaking, and foreign involvement is both a necessary and a complicating factor. We need foreign assistance—and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> that—but our friends do not know the local conditions and propose things that cannot or should not be built in an earthquake-prone region." ...|$|E

Some have {{argued for a}} more nuanced view of Stein's collaborationist activity, arguing that it was rooted in her wartime predicament and status as a Jew in Nazi-occupied France. Similarly, Stein commented in 1938 on Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, Franklin D.

Instead, {{millions}} of Germans gathered on the streets to express their grief and to demonstrate against counter-revolutionary terrorism. When the news of Rathenau's death became known in the Reichstag, the session turned into turmoil. DNVP-politician Karl Helfferich in particular became the target of attacks, because he had just recently uttered a vitriolic attack upon Rathenau. During the official memorial ceremony the next day, Chancellor Joseph Wirth from the Centre Party held a speech soon to be famous, in which, while pointing {{to the right side}} of the parliamentary floor, he used a well known formula of Philipp Scheidemann: [...] "There is the enemy - and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> it: This enemy is on the right!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Compared {{to other}} {{diseases}} or other cancers, breast cancer receives a proportionately {{greater share of}} resources and attention. In 2001 MP Ian Gibson, chairman of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom all party group on cancer stated [...] "The treatment has been skewed by the lobbying, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> that. Breast cancer sufferers get better treatment in terms of bed spaces, facilities and doctors and nurses." [...] Breast cancer also receives significantly more media coverage than other, equally prevalent cancers, with a study by Prostate Coalition showing 2.6 breast cancer stories for each one covering cancer of the prostate. Ultimately there is a concern that favoring sufferers of breast cancer with disproportionate funding and research on their behalf may well be costing lives elsewhere. [...] Partly because of its relatively high prevalence and long-term survival rates, research is biased towards breast cancer. [...] Some subjects, such as cancer-related fatigue, have been studied little except in women with breast cancer.|$|E

2500|$|Todd is {{probably}} correct {{in saying that}} Aphra Behn did not set out to protest slavery, but however tepid her feelings about slavery, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> her feelings {{on the subject of}} natural kingship. The final words of the novel are a slight expiation of the narrator's guilt, but it is for the individual man she mourns and for the individual that she writes a tribute, and she lodges no protest over slavery itself. A natural king could not be enslaved, and, as in the play Behn wrote while in Surinam, The Young King, no land could prosper without a king. Her fictional Surinam is a headless body. Without a true and natural leader (a king) the feeble and corrupt men of position abuse their power. What was missing was Lord Willoughby, or the narrator's father: [...] a true lord. In the absence of such leadership, a true king, Oroonoko, is misjudged, mistreated, and killed.|$|E
