The synthesis of numerous iridocenium salts including the tribromide and hexafluorophosphate have been described. Just as with rhodocene, iridocene dimerises {{at room temperature}} but a monomer form can be detected at low temperatures and in gas phase and IR, NMR, and ESR measurements indicate a chemical equilibrium is present and confirm the sandwich structure of the iridocene monomer. The complex , the analogue of rhodocene derivative reported by Fischer, has also been studied and demonstrates properties consistent with {{a greater degree of}} π-backbonding in iridium(I) systems than is found in the analogous cobalt(I) or rhodium(I) cases.|$|E

5|$|Theoretical {{interest}} in <b>the</b> <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> unhexquadium is largely motivated by theoretical predictions that it, especially the isotope 482Uhq (with 164 protons and 318 neutrons), {{would be at}} the center of a hypothetical second island of stability (the first being centered around 306Ubb, with 122 protons and 184 neutrons).|$|E
5|$|This {{similarity}} {{results in}} nearly identical chemical behavior {{and in the}} formation of similar chemical compounds. <b>The</b> <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> hafnium is so similar to that of zirconium that a separation on chemical reactions was not possible; only the physical properties of the compounds differ. The melting points and boiling points of the compounds and the solubility in solvents are the major differences in <b>the</b> <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> these twin elements. Titanium is considerably different from the other two owing to the effects of the lanthanide contraction.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{chemistry}} {{is similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> the late first-row transition metals, nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell and compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless. The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some of the equivalent salts have the same crystal structure, and in other circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor, <b>the</b> <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> zinc has {{much in common with}} that of magnesium. In other respects, there is little similarity with the late first-row transition metals. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors. Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known.|$|E

5|$|As the {{universe}} cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate {{that of the}} photon radiation.
