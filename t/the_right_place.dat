Trigonometric functions were implemented in about 40 instructions, and inverse trigonometric functions are almost 30 more instructions. Logarithms are about 40 instructions, with anti-log about 20 on top of that. The code to normalize and display the computed values are roughly the same in both the TI and Sinclair programs.|$|E
5|$|Why {{they went}} to land {{in the first place}} is still debated. One reason could be that the small juveniles who had {{completed}} their metamorphosis had what it took to make use of what land had to offer. Already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (just as modern fish and amphibians often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests), two very different niches partially overlapped each other, with the young juveniles in the diffuse line between. One of them was overcrowded and dangerous while the other was much safer and much less crowded, offering less competition over resources. The terrestrial niche was also a much more challenging place for primary aquatic animals, but because of the way evolution and selection pressure work, those juveniles who could take advantage of this would be rewarded. Once they gained a small foothold on land, thanks to their preadaptations and being at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>place</b> at the right time, favourable variations in their descendants would gradually result in continuing evolution and diversification.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the “right to place” as a {{political}} theory of wild animal <b>rights.</b> Out of <b>the</b> debate between terrestrial cosmopolitans inspired by Kant and Arendt and rooted cosmopolitan animal <b>right</b> theorists, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to <b>place</b> emerges from the fold of rooted cosmopolitanism in tandem with environmental and ecological principles. Contrary to terrestrial cosmopolitans—who favour extending citizenship rights to wild animals and advocate at the same time large-scale humanitarian interventions and unrestricted geographical mobility—I argue that the well-being of wild animals is best served by <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to <b>place</b> theory on account of its sovereignty model. <b>The</b> <b>right</b> to <b>place</b> theory advocates human non-interference in wildlife communities, opposing even humanitarian interventions, which carry the risk of unintended consequences. <b>The</b> <b>right</b> to <b>place</b> theory, with its emphasis on territorial sovereignty, bases its opposition to unrestricted geographical mobility on two considerations: (a) the non-generalist nature of many species and (b) the potential for abuse via human encroachment. In a broader context, the advantage of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to <b>place</b> theory lies in its implicit environmental demands: human population control and sustainable lifestyles...|$|R

Additionally, Weekes was an excellent fielder, initially in the covers before moving into the slips, and produced a training manual entitled Aspects of Fielding.|$|E
