The two men greatly respected one another and shared a bond in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>both</b> had past military experience. Their positive relationship facilitated Clark’s many accomplishments while in Sapporo and accounted for the wide latitude Clark was given in implementing not just SAC programs, but also his influence on the colonial development of Hokkaido.|$|E
5|$|After {{teaching}} as a master of arts in Paris for over forty years, Robert was recalled to England by King Henry II in 1160, and was appointed Bishop of Hereford in 1163. He was consecrated at Canterbury on 22December by Archbishop Thomas Becket. Becket had been prominent among those recommending Robert for the vacancy at Hereford; one of Becket's later biographers said that Becket urged the king to find benefices for Englishmen living abroad. There {{is some evidence that}} Pope Alexander III had a hand in Robert's election, as Becket in 1166 reminded Robert and Roger of Worcester <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>both</b> owed their episcopates to Alexander.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} {{rigorous}} training, Diana wins another amateur fight, this time against a girl, Ricki Stiles. Although Diana has accepted Adrian's apology, tensions rise between them again when they learn <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>both</b> have {{advanced to the}} finals in their division to fight each other. Adrian refuses to fight a girl and Diana struggles to convince him to view her as a legitimate opponent. He turns up for the fight on the day, however, and after an even match, Diana wins with a unanimous decision by the judges. After the fight, Adrian fears that he has lost Diana's respect, but she tells him she respects him even more for fighting her, and they reconcile.|$|E

5|$|In a draft {{resolution}} for the IAU definition of planet, both Pluto and Charon {{would have been}} considered dwarf planets in a binary system, given <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>both</b> satisfied the mass and shape requirements for dwarf planets and revolved around a common center of mass located between the two bodies (rather than within one of the bodies). The IAU currently states that Charon is not considered to be a dwarf planet and is just a satellite of Pluto, although the idea that Charon might qualify to be a dwarf planet in its own right may be considered at a later date. The location of the barycenter depends not only on the relative masses of the bodies, but also on the distance between them; the barycenter of the Sun–Jupiter orbit, for example, lies outside the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Life is {{a memoir}} {{covering}} Keith Richards's life, starting with {{his childhood in}} Dartford, Kent, through to his success with the Rolling Stones and his current life in Connecticut. His interest in music was triggered by his mother, Doris, who played records by Sarah Vaughan, Billy Eckstine and Louis Armstrong, and his maternal grandfather, Augustus Theodore Dupree, a former big band player, who encouraged him {{to take up the}} guitar. In his teens he met up with Mick Jagger, who he had known in primary school, and discovered <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>both</b> shared a love of blues music. In the early 1960s Richards moved into a London flat, shared with Jagger and Brian Jones. Together with Bill Wyman, Ian Stewart and Charlie Watts, the Rolling Stones were founded in 1962, playing gigs at Ealing Jazz Club and the Crawdaddy Club.|$|E
5|$|What keeps this densely {{realised}} confection aloft is {{that very}} quality of reverence to {{the writers of}} the past. The chief character in Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell isn't, in fact, either of the magicians: it's the library <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>both</b> adore, the books they consult and write and, in a sense, become. Clarke's giddiness comes from finding a way at once to enter the company of her literary heroes, to pay them homage and {{to add to the}} literature.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the very}} {{different}} circumstances from which they came, and in which they played, the rhythm and blues produced by British artists was very different in tone from that created by African Americans, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. They have been criticised for exploiting the massive catalogue of African American music, {{but it has also}} been noted <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>both</b> popularised that music, bringing it to British, world and in some cases American audiences, and helping to build the reputation of existing and past rhythm and blues artists. In order to sustain their careers most British R artists soon moved on from recording and performing American standards to writing and recording their own music. Many from the 60s helped pioneer psychedelic, and eventually progressive, hard rock and heavy metal, mixing in elements of world, folk and classical music. Others from the 1970s and 1980s, helped shape new wave and post-punk music and had a major impact on later genres, including Britpop. As a result, British rhythm and blues has been a major component of the sound of rock music.|$|E
5|$|One day, Elliot Edwards and Claris Sinclair, two {{teenagers}} {{from the city}} of Twin Seeds, go through failures. Elliot is a basketball player who enjoys a game with his friends. He is challenged by a group of older school students and suffers a humiliating defeat on the court. Claris is a talented singer and her ambition is to perform on stage. She auditions for a part in the events commemorating the centenary of the city of Twin Seeds. Standing in front of the judges, she is overcome by stage fright and does not perform well, which causes her to lose all hopes of getting the role. When they go to sleep that night, both Elliot and Claris suffer nightmares that replay the events. They escape into Nightopia and find <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>both</b> possess the rare Red Ideya of Courage, the only type that Wizeman cannot steal.|$|E
5|$|Sky and Lana {{start to}} {{trust each other}} a little, and during a sleepover {{organised}} by Serena, they discover <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>both</b> like black and white films. They bond, and Lana later watches Sky fall asleep. Sky realises that Lana has hidden depths and tells her. Lana gets upset and tells Sky {{that she is not}} hiding anything. Sky calls a friend who attended Wattle Heights High with Lana and finds out about the bullying that caused Lana to change schools. During a playfight at a sleepover, Lana suddenly kisses Sky. She runs {{out of the house and}} goes to the Coffee Shop, where she finds Sindi. Lana reveals to Sindi that she is gay. Lana admits that she does not want to lose Sky as a friend and tries to pass the kiss off as a joke. Sky tells Boyd Hoyland (Kyal Marsh) about the kiss, and Lana is later outed at school.|$|E

5|$|Starship Troopers had {{a direct}} {{influence}} on many later science fiction stories. John Steakley's 1984 novel Armor was, according to the author, born out of frustration with {{the small amount of}} actual combat in Starship Troopers and because he wanted this aspect developed further. The 1988 Gainax OVA series Gunbuster has plot elements similar to Heinlein's novel, depicting humanity arrayed against an alien military. Scholars have identified elements of Heinlein's influence in Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, as well. Hantke, in particular, compares the battle room in Ender's Game to Heinlein's prosthetic suits, stating <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>both</b> regulate but also enhance human agency. Suvin suggests parallels between the plots of the two novels, with human society in both stories at war against insect-like aliens, but states that the story of Ender Wiggin takes a very different direction, as Ender regrets his genocidal actions and dedicates his efforts to protecting his erstwhile targets.|$|E
5|$|The main rivalry {{heading into}} Vengeance was between WWE Champion and ECW World Champion Rob Van Dam who {{defending}} the WWE Championship against Edge in a singles match. The buildup to the match {{began on the}} television premiere of ECW on Sci Fi, in which Van Dam was awarded the ECW World Heavyweight Championship (which later become simply known as ECW World Championship) by Paul Heyman, thus making Van Dam a double champion, by holding both the ECW and WWE Championships. Van Dam's celebration was then interrupted by Edge and his girlfriend Lita. Edge, who was number one contender for the title, informed Van Dam <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>both</b> had a lot in common, referring to them being both Money in the Bank winners and successfully becoming WWE Champions. Edge concluded with giving Van Dam some kind words, in which afterwards he performed a Spear on Van Dam. On the June 19 episode of Raw, in retaliation Van Dam attacked Edge, moments after winning a match against Ric Flair. On June 20 episode of ECW, Rob Van Dam and Kurt Angle defeated Edge and Randy Orton in a tag team match when Van Dam pinned Edge after Five Star Frog Splash.|$|E
5|$|This {{process can}} be modeled by Rule 184, as follows. The {{particles}} are modeled as points that are aligned, not with {{the cells of the}} automaton, but rather with the interstices between cells. Two consecutive cells that both have state 0 model a particle at the space between these two cells that moves rightwards one cell at each time step. Symmetrically, two consecutive cells that both have state 1 model an antiparticle that moves leftwards one cell at each time step. The remaining possibilities for two consecutive cells are <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>both</b> have differing states; this is interpreted as modeling a background material without any particles in it, through which the particles move. With this interpretation, the particles and antiparticles interact by ballistic annihilation: when a rightwards-moving particle and a leftwards-moving antiparticle meet, the result is a region of background from which both particles have vanished, without any effect on any other nearby particles.|$|E
