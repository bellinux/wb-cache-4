5|$|Andrea Dworkin opposed LEAF's position, {{arguing that}} feminists should not support or attempt to reform {{criminal}} obscenity law. In 1993, copies of Dworkin's book Pornography were held for inspection by Canada Customs agents, fostering an urban legend that Dworkin's own books had been banned from Canada under a law <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> had promoted. However, the Butler decision did not adopt Dworkin and MacKinnon's ordinance, Dworkin {{did not support}} the decision, and her books (which were released shortly after they were inspected) were held temporarily as part of a standard procedural measure, unrelated to the Butler decision.|$|E
5|$|As {{the singer}} walks through a forest, {{the father is}} shown resorting to {{drinking}} in grief. A funeral scene follows, showing the girl walking up to her mother's wake. When she sees her mother's lips sealed with thread, she runs away from the wake. Madonna walks through a house, where shadows show the girl being scolded and shouted at by the father. Ultimately she walks to the graveyard and stands beside an old man, implying <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> is the little girl portrayed. The video ends with the little girl dancing {{in front of her}} mother's grave as snow falls around her.|$|E
5|$|Ciocia {{writes that}} {{with half the}} novel taking place in {{theatrical}} settings, Nan may be playing a role as character in her own life or a play on a stage set in a theatre or the streets of London. She starts as a spectator watching Kitty onstage, and later with Kitty, watching how men move and behave to improve their act. She becomes a performer, with Kitty, as a renter and again for the predatory Diana and her friends. Finally she takes the role of director as she assists and impels Ralph to perform his speech. At this point, {{she is able to}} reconcile her identity and the story ends. Waters consciously chose to create a complicated plot, and was impressed with Iris Murdoch's claim <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> had entire stories worked out well in advance of writing them, a method Waters used with Tipping the Velvet.|$|E

5|$|In December 1818, the Shelleys {{travelled}} {{south with}} Claire Clairmont and their servants to Naples, where they stayed for three months, receiving only one visitor, a physician. In 1820, {{they found themselves}} plagued by accusations and threats from Paolo and Elise Foggi, former servants whom Percy Shelley had dismissed in Naples shortly after the Foggis had married. The pair revealed that on 27 February 1819 in Naples, Percy Shelley had registered as his child by Mary Shelley a two-month-old baby girl named Elena Adelaide Shelley. The Foggis also claimed that Claire Clairmont was the baby's mother. Biographers have offered various interpretations of these events: that Percy Shelley decided to adopt a local child; that the baby was his by Elise, Claire, or an unknown woman; or that she was Elise's by Byron. Mary Shelley insisted she would have known if Claire had been pregnant, but {{it is unclear how}} much she really knew. The events in Naples, a city Mary Shelley later called a paradise inhabited by devils, remain shrouded in mystery. The only certainty is <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> was not the childâ€™s mother. Elena Adelaide Shelley died in Naples on 9 June 1820.|$|E

25|$|At Talkback Thames, Heggessey was {{responsible}} for overseeing the production of high-profile programmes such as ITV1's The Bill and The X Factor, BBC One's QI and Channel 4's Green Wing. She was also responsible for delivering to BBC One in early 2006 two Stephen Poliakoff dramas <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> had commissioned before she left the channel, Friends and Crocodiles and Gideon's Daughter, the latter of which {{went on to win}} two Golden Globe Awards (Mini-series, Best Actor for Bill Nighy and Mini-series, Best Supporting Actress for Emily Blunt) in 2007.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} lovely and adorable women too, like Vanathi, Kodumbalur princess (the woman who becomes Arulmozhivarman's wife later) {{who is in}} love with Arulmozhi; Poonkuzhali, the boat woman who rows the future king from Lanka; Mandakini, the deaf and dumb step-mother of the {{original}} maduranthaka chola and the aunt of Poonkuzhali.

25|$|Using the {{evidence}} of the ancient sources, it was at one time suggested that Aurelian's mother was a freedwoman of a member of the clan Aurelius and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> was a priestess of the Sun-God in her native village. These two propositions, together with the tradition that the clan Aurelius had been entrusted with the maintenance of that deity's cult in Rome, inspired the notion that this could explain the devotion to the sun-god that Aurelian was to manifest as Emperor - see below. However, it seems that this pleasant extrapolation of dubious facts is now generally accepted as being no more than just that.|$|E

25|$|The {{people and}} warriors in Arindal's capital are panicking {{because they are}} under attack. Lora berates them, saying <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> stands firm even though she has lost father, brother and lover. She reminds them of Groma's prophecy that the kingdom will not fall if Arindal returns, but the chorus express doubts. Just as she begins to fear that they are right (O musst du Hoffnung schwinden), a {{messenger}} arrives to announce that Arindal is on his way. The new king is greeted joyously by his people, but Arindal himself expresses his fears {{that he is not}} strong enough for battle. Meanwhile, Morald and Lora express their mutual love.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{although}} {{she does not}} mention it in her memoirs, she appears to have left the dragoons and returned home; on 27 June 1796, she married Henri Commarmot, a cavalryman in the , then forming part of the Dijon garrison in the Army of the Rhine. Army records show <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> joined the 8th Hussars as a trooper on 21 December 1797, under the surname of SangÃ¨ne; she remained with them even when Commarmot transferred to another regiment, but in November 1798, she transferred back to the 15th Dragoons. She was thus {{a soldier in the}} Hussars during the invasion of Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|Coulter later {{stated that}} she would come to mistrust the motives of Jones' head lawyer, Joseph Cammaratta, who by August or September 1997 was advising Jones that her case was weak and to settle, if a {{favorable}} settlement could be negotiated. From the outset, Jones had sought an apology from Clinton at least as eagerly as she sought a settlement. However, in a later interview Coulter recounted <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> had believed that the case was strong, that Jones was telling the truth, that Clinton should be held publicly accountable for his misconduct, and that a settlement would {{give the impression that}} Jones was merely interested in extorting money from the President.|$|E

Her optimistic central theme remains similar throughout all four books. So do the central figures, who are all young girls facing harsh realities of life unimaginable by their more fortunate contemporaries in developed countries. With her sensitivity for the emotional world of her characters, Ho showed her readers the humane side behind atrocities of the October 6 massacre of student protesters in Bangkok and the Khmer Rouge regime. Against poverty, sexual discrimination, oppression, war, loss of loved ones, she maintained that human spirit should prevail.|$|E
25|$|The {{constellation}} {{is named}} after Cassiopeia, the queen of Aethiopia. Cassiopeia was the wife of King Cepheus of Aethiopia and mother of Princess Andromeda. Cepheus and Cassiopeia were placed {{next to each other}} among the stars, along with Andromeda. She was placed in the sky as a punishment after enraging Poseidon with the boast that her daughter Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereids or, alternatively, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> was more beautiful than the sea nymphs. She was forced to wheel around the North Celestial Pole on her throne, spending half of her time clinging to it so she does not fall off, and Poseidon decreed that Andromeda should be bound to a rock as prey for the monster Cetus. Andromeda was then rescued by the hero Perseus, whom she later married.|$|E
25|$|In Ng Chee Tiong Tony v. Public Prosecutor (2007), Justice Lee Seiu Kin {{set aside}} a trial judge's {{decision}} as he held that the judge had descended into the arena and joined in the fray. This {{was evident in the}} manner the trial judge had questioned the witnesses. There were excessive questions by the judge, especially some in the nature of a cross-examination. The conclusions formed by the judge also arose out of the line of questioning <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> had adopted. The High Court also mentioned that it was the duty of the Prosecution to bring out the evidence to prove its case and not the judge's duty to do so, even if it was an attempt to make up for any shortfall in the conduct of the case by the prosecutor.|$|E
