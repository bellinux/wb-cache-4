500|$|After {{going home}} to Rhode Island, Dyer {{spent most of the}} {{following}} winter on Shelter Island, sitting between the north and south forks of Long Island. [...] Though sheltered from storms, the island's owner, Nathaniel Sylvester, used it as a refuge for Quakers seeking shelter from the Puritans, thus providing its name. [...] Here Dyer was able to commune with her fellow Quakers, including her Newport neighbors, William Coddington and his wife Anne Brinley, who had recently converted. [...] Dyer used her time here <b>to</b> <b>mull</b> <b>over</b> the vindication prepared by the Puritan authorities to send to England, concerning their actions against the Quakers. [...] This document was an affront to Dyer, and she viewed it as merely a means to soften public outrage. [...] She was determined to return to Boston to force the authorities to either change their laws or to hang a woman, and she left Shelter Island in April 1660 focused on this mission.|$|E
500|$|The {{front cover}} for Marquee Moon {{was shot by}} {{photographer}} Robert Mapplethorpe, who had previously shot the cover for Patti Smith's 1975 album Horses. His photo situated Verlaine a step {{in front of the}} rest of the band, who were captured in a tensed, serious pose. Verlaine held his right hand across his body and extended his slightly clenched left hand forward. When Mapplethorpe gave Television the contact prints, Lloyd took the band's favorite shot to a print shop in Times Square and asked for color photocopies for the group members <b>to</b> <b>mull</b> <b>over.</b> Although the first few copies were oddly colored, Lloyd asked the copy worker to print more [...] "while turning the knobs with his eyes closed". He likened the process to Andy Warhol's screen prints. After he showed it to the group, they chose the altered copy over Mapplethorpe's original photo, which Fred Smith had framed and kept for himself.|$|E

The members of the jury, fighting their case from prison in what became known as Bushel's Case, managed to win the right for all English juries to be free from the control of judges.

30|$|Thus the Wayang is {{not just}} a moralistic text. It eggs the viewer on to think for himself, and realize the dilemma of both sides of the issues. While many {{articles}} and books have been written about the symbolic, spiritual, ethical, aesthetic and philosophical values of the various themes presented in a Wayang performance, the author brings out specifically how it is much deeper than just a war between the good and the evil forces and certainly not just for entertainment. We need <b>to</b> constantly <b>mull</b> <b>over</b> the various presentations of the Wayang to make it relevant to present day issues. It reveals how the average audience is consistently informed of Indonesian cultural and ethical values through the Wayang, and how insistent the Wayang itself is in its preference for a self-searching and inward contemplation as opposed to a black and white perception of the situation.|$|R

Relieved {{that he has not}} discovered their secret, Margaret begs him to change his mind, but he will not. She invites him to take a walk with her, and the two wander from one end of Florence to the other as the sun slowly sets and the night comes on ("Let’s Walk"). By giving him time <b>to</b> <b>mull</b> things <b>over</b> and by not pressuring him, Margaret succeeds in putting the wedding back on track; Signor Naccarelli says he will meet them at the church the following morning.|$|R

His adoptive woodtroll mother tells him to travel to their cousin's house <b>to</b> <b>mull</b> things <b>over,</b> but during Twig's journey through the Deepwoods, he is seduced by the beauty of the woods themselves and ends up straying from the path.

The forest is populated with both fierce natural predators and evil demons, the most dangerous demon being the Gloamglozer. The Gloamglozer can shapeshift in order to attract victims, and it can also mimick the voices of any animal in distress. Twig does indeed hear such a voice, and follows it, but stumbles upon a Slaughterer, who is being attacked by a Hoverworm. Twig kills the Hoverworm and the grateful Slaughterer invites him to spend the night in his village. However, the Slaughterer has been poisoned by the Hoverworm and is swelling up.
