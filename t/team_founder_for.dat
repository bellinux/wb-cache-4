5000|$|The {{trainees}} {{started their}} second mission: group performances {{in front of}} a live audience. 16 teams are formed to compete for 8 songs given: Super Junior's [...] "Sorry Sorry", Shinee's [...] "Replay", 2PM's [...] "10 out of 10", B2ST's [...] "Shock", Infinite's [...] "Be Mine", EXO's [...] "Call Me Baby", BTS's [...] "Boy in Luv", and SEVENTEEN's [...] "Mansae". Being the Center, Lee Dae-hwi chooses his team first. The remaining 15 <b>team</b> <b>founders</b> are chosen by random draw. Each group consists of 5-7 members. The <b>team</b> <b>founders</b> then compete <b>for</b> songs individually through a race: only 8 can secure their desired songs and choose their opponent from the remaining 8 teams who lose in the race. The episode later showed the groups rehearsing and assigning roles of the 'leader', 'center', 'main vocalist', 'sub vocalists', and 'rappers'. Each song is then performed live by the two groups and each member is voted on separately by the live audience. The winning team among the two is determined by combining the individual scores. Members of the winning group would gain an extra 3000 points each, to be included into the ranking announcement of the week after. The group with the highest overall points would later perform on M! Countdown. Only four teams covering [...] "10 Out of 10" [...] and [...] "Call Me Baby" [...] were covered this week.|$|R
