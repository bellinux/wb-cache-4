The film was an adaptation of the Betty Comden and Adolph Green Broadway musical about sailors on leave in New York City {{and was the first}} musical to be filmed on location. Donen and Kelly had wanted to shoot the entire film in New York, but Freed would only allow them to spend one week away from the studio.|$|E

Along with teammates Rex Grossman and Tommie Harris, Hester appeared on the February 2007 issue of Sports Illustrated for Kids. His reputation {{has also been}} bolstered by EA Sports' Madden NFL 08, where Hester's perfect 100 speed rating made him the fastest player in the game's history. Hester also appeared in a promotional video for the game. He appeared in commercials for Under Armour in 2008 and 2009. In 2013, Hester outran a cheetah in a race sponsored by National Geographic at Busch Gardens Tampa. The competition consisted of Hester running back and forth on a straight track to simulate laps, while the cheetah ran in a similar but separate track.|$|E

25|$|After {{appearing}} on Broadway in Laffing Room Only, which closed there, Garrett traveled {{with the show}} as it played extended runs in Detroit and Chicago. After that she returned to New York and was cast in Call Me Mister, which reunited her with Harold Rome, Lehman Engel, and Jules Munshin. She won critical acclaim and the Donaldson Award for her performance, which prompted Al Hirschfeld to caricature her in the New York Times. It led to her being signed to a one-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer by Louis B. Mayer. Garrett arrived at the studio in January 1947 and made her film debut portraying nightclub performer Shoo Shoo O'Grady in Big City, directed by Norman Taurog and co-starring George Murphy and Robert Preston. Mayer renewed her contract and she appeared in the musicals Words and Music, On the Town, <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> <b>To</b> <b>The</b> Ball Game, and Neptune's Daughter in quick succession.|$|E

[...] Rubin credits Donen and Kelly with making musicals more realistic, compared to Berkeley's style of a [...] "separation of narrative space from performance space" [...] <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ball Game was Berkeley's last film as a director and today {{can be viewed as}} a passing of the torch. Both Donen and Kelly found working with Berkeley difficult, and the director left before the film's completion.

500|$|In 1949, Sinatra co-starred with Gene Kelly in the Technicolor musical <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ball Game, a film set in 1908, {{in which}} Sinatra and Kelly play {{baseball}} {{players who are}} part-time vaudevillians. He teamed up with Kelly {{for a third time}} in On the Town, playing a sailor on leave in New York City. Today the film is rated very highly by critics, and in 2006 it ranked No. 19 on the American Film Institute's list of best musicals. Both Double Dynamite (1951), an RKO Irving Cummings comedy produced by Howard Hughes, and Joseph Pevney's Meet Danny Wilson (1952) failed to make an impression.

500|$|While Kelly {{completed}} his {{service in the}} U.S. Naval Air Service as a photographer from 1944 to 1946, Donen worked uncredited as a choreographer on musical films. Of this period Donen said, [...] "I practiced my craft, working with music, track and photography. I often directed the sequences. I always tried to have an original idea {{about how to do}} musical sequences." [...] Donen has stated that he was excused from military service as 4-F because of high blood pressure. When Kelly returned to civilian life, he and Donen directed and choreographed Kelly's dance scenes in Living in a Big Way. They then began work on an original story about two baseball players in the early 20th century who spend their off-season as vaudevillian song and dance men. This film would eventually become <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ball Game in 1949. Kelly and Donen had hoped to co-direct the film, but Freed hired Busby Berkeley instead and they only directed Kelly's dance numbers. The film starred Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin.|$|E

2500|$|Filming <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ball Game (1949) [...] was, {{according}} to Williams in her autobiography, {{an experience of}} [...] "pure misery".

She claimed that Kelly and co-writer Stanley Donen treated her with contempt and {{went out of their}} way to make jokes at her expense. The film was well-received critically and became a major commercial success, raking in $3.4 million in rentals and becoming the 11th highest earning film of the year. Williams made Neptune's Daughter (also 1949) around the same time with co-stars Ricardo Montalbán, Red Skelton and Betty Garrett, who had also been in <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ball Game.

2500|$|MGM wanted Kelly {{to return}} to safer and more {{commercial}} vehicles, but he ceaselessly fought {{for an opportunity to}} direct his own musical film. In the interim, he capitalized on his swashbuckling image as d'Artagnan in The Three Musketeers—and also appeared with Vera-Ellen in the Slaughter on Tenth Avenue ballet in Words and Music (1948). He was due to play the male lead opposite Garland in Easter Parade (1948), but broke his ankle playing volleyball. He withdrew from the film and convinced Fred Astaire to come out of retirement to replace him. There followed <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ball Game (1949), his second film with Sinatra, where Kelly paid tribute to his Irish heritage in The Hat My Father Wore on St. Patrick's Day routine. This musical film persuaded Arthur Freed to have Kelly make On the Town, in which he partnered with Frank Sinatra for the third and final time. A breakthrough in the musical film genre, it has been described as [...] "the most inventive and effervescent musical thus far produced in Hollywood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Enrico Caruso {{once said}} that all it takes for {{successful}} performance of Il trovatore is the four greatest singers in the world. On many different occasions, this opera and its music have been featured in various forms of popular culture and entertainment. Scenes of comic chaos play out over a performance of Il trovatore in the Marx Brothers's film, A Night at the Opera (including a quotation, {{in the middle of}} the Act I Overture, of <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ball Game). Luchino Visconti used a performance of Il trovatore at La Fenice opera house for the opening sequence of his 1954 film Senso. As Manrico sings his battle cry in [...] "Di quella pira", the performance is interrupted by the answering cries of Italian nationalists in the upper balcony who shower the stalls area below with patriotic leaflets. In Italian Film in the Light of Neorealism, Millicent Marcus proposes that Visconti used this operatic paradigm throughout Senso, with parallels between the opera's protagonists, Manrico and Leonora, and the film's protagonists, Ussoni and Livia. A staging of Act 1, Scene 2 of Il trovatore is featured in Bernardo Bertolucci's 1979 film La Luna.|$|E
2500|$|According to Delamater, Kelly's work [...] "seems to {{represent}} the fulfillment of dance-film integration in the 1940s and 1950s". While Fred Astaire had revolutionized the filming of dance in the 1930s by insisting on full-figure photography of dancers while allowing only a modest degree of camera movement, Kelly freed up the camera, making greater use of space, camera movement, camera angles and editing, creating a partnership between dance movement and camera movement without sacrificing full-figure framing. Kelly's reasoning behind this was that he felt the kinetic force of live dance often evaporated when brought to film, and he sought to partially overcome this by involving the camera in movement and giving the dancer {{a greater number of}} directions in which to move. Examples of this abound in Kelly's work and are well illustrated in the [...] "Prehistoric Man" [...] sequence from On the Town and [...] "The Hat My Father Wore on St. Patrick's Day" [...] from <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ball Game. In 1951, he summed up his vision as follows: [...] "If the camera is to make a contribution at all to dance, this must be the focal point of its contribution; the fluid background, giving each spectator an undistorted and altogether similar view of dancer and background. To accomplish this, the camera is made fluid, moving with the dancer, so that the lens becomes the eye of the spectator, your eye".|$|E
