25|$|A rapid start ballast applies voltage and heats the cathodes simultaneously. It {{provides}} superior lamp {{life and}} more cycle life, but uses slightly more energy as the electrodes in {{each end of}} the lamp continue to consume heating power as the lamp operates. Again, although popular in 100-120volt countries for lamps of 40W and above, rapid start is sometimes used in other countries particularly where <b>the</b> <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> switch start systems is undesirable.|$|E
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the inductor is that current is shifted {{out of phase}} with the voltage, producing a poor power factor. In more expensive ballasts, a capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In ballasts that control two or more lamps, line-frequency ballasts commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates <b>the</b> <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> the individual lamps, it also helps maintain a high power factor. These ballasts are often called lead-lag ballasts because the current in one lamp leads the mains phase and the current in the other lamp lags the mains phase.|$|E
25|$|An instant start ballast {{does not}} preheat the electrodes, instead using a {{relatively}} high voltage (~600V) to initiate the discharge arc. It is the most energy efficient type, but yields the fewest lamp-start cycles, as material is blasted {{from the surface of}} the cold electrodes each time the lamp is turned on. Instant-start ballasts are best suited to applications with long duty cycles, where the lamps are not frequently turned on and off. Although these were mostly used in countries with 100-120volt mains supplies (for lamps of 40W or above), they were briefly popular in other countries because the lamp started without <b>the</b> <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> switch start systems. The popularity was short lived because of the short lamp life.|$|E

Among {{them is a}} story listed as [...] "boobrie as tarbh uisge". The tale starts by detailing how a man named Eachann fed a colossal black bull when he discovered it writhing in pain and possibly close to death {{at the side of}} Loch nan Dobhran, on the west coast of Argyll. Some months later, Phemie, Eachann's girlfriend, is occasionally disturbed by elusive shadows she senses on the loch, which make her think of Murdoch, her former paramour. While she sat dreaming of Eachann one evening when staying at a sheiling near the loch, she sensed <b>the</b> <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> a shadow behind her, except this time it was Murdoch. He promptly overpowered her by enveloping her in a blanket and tying her hands. At that point, a water bull came to Phemie's rescue by knocking Murdoch to the ground. The bull then knelt down allowing Phemie to get on its back, before transporting her {{at the speed of light}} back to the home of her mother. The bull disappeared never to be seen again but a [...] "voice was heard in the air calling out loudly". The verse heard was in Gaelic, and translates as: ...|$|E
