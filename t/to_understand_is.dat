500|$|What is {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> what exactly Locke means when he advises parents {{to treat their}} children as reasoning beings. Locke first highlights that children [...] "love {{to be treated as}} Rational Creatures," [...] thus parents should treat them as such. Tarcov argues that this suggests children can be considered rational only in that they respond to the desire to be treated as reasoning creatures and that they are [...] "motivated only [...] rewards and punishments" [...] to achieve that goal.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{continuing}} {{debates about}} authorship, {{the work is}} almost always treated as Monteverdi's—although Rosand observes that some scholars attribute it to [...] "Monteverdi" [...] (in quotation marks). Ringer calls the opera [...] "Monteverdi's last and arguably greatest work," [...] a unified masterpiece of [...] "unprecedented depth and individuality". Carter observes how Monteverdi's operas redefined the boundaries of theatrical music, and calls his contribution to 17th-century Venetian opera [...] "remarkable by any standard". Harnoncourt reflects thus: [...] "What is difficult <b>to</b> <b>understand...</b> <b>is</b> the mental freshness with which the 74-year-old composer, two years before his death, was able to surpass his pupils in the most modern style and to set standards which were {{to apply to the}} music theatre of the succeeding centuries." ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{issue that}} has been {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> how they took off. Earlier suggestions were that pterosaurs were largely cold-blooded gliding animals, deriving warmth from the environment like modern lizards, rather than burning calories. In this case, it was unclear how the larger ones of enormous size, with an inefficient cold-blooded metabolism, could manage a bird-like takeoff strategy, using only the hind limbs to generate thrust for getting airborne. Later research shows them instead as being warm-blooded and having powerful flight muscles, and using the flight muscles for walking as quadrupeds. Mark Witton of the University of Portsmouth and Mike Habib of Johns Hopkins University suggested that pterosaurs used a vaulting mechanism to obtain flight. The tremendous power of their winged forelimbs {{would enable them to}} take off with ease. Once aloft, pterosaurs could reach speeds of up to [...] and travel thousands of kilometres.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} when describing Chi's character, Clamp member Satsuki Igarashi stated [...] "Lately we've {{been saying that}} the easiest <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> Chii from 'Chobits.' Errors occur with computers. Things like 'Although it's fine to speak the instructions' and 'Please fix this problem here' might be spoken in a cute voice." [...] In addition, an explanation for Chobitss plot was given by Igarashi who stated: [...] "Back then, when our computer had problems all we would get were these inscrutable error messages. However, {{we had no idea}} what was wrong because it wouldn't tell us any more". Clamp also describes Chobits as a variation of the [...] "boy living with mysterious girl" [...] genre. Chi's design as a personal computer resulted from Ohkawa's wish to increase the sense of [...] "emotional discomfort" [...] around becoming emotionally involved with something considered to be merely a lifeless machine.|$|E

50|$|Gadamer {{pointed out}} that {{prejudice}} {{is an element of}} our understanding and is not per se without value.

He said that we can never step outside of our tradition — all we can do <b>is</b> try <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it. This further elaborates the idea of the hermeneutic circle.|$|R

2500|$|Historian James J. Weingartner sees a {{connection}} between the American mutilation of Japanese war dead and the bombings. According to Weingartner both were partially the result of a dehumanization of the enemy. [...] "he widespread image of the Japanese as sub-human constituted an emotional context which provided another justification for decisions which resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands." [...] On the second day after the bombing of Nagasaki, President Truman had stated: [...] "The only language they seem <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> the one we have been using to bombard them. When {{you have to deal with}} a beast you have to treat him like a beast. It is most regrettable but nevertheless true".|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, {{professor}} and New York Times writer Jay Dolan critiqued Generations for not talking more about class, race and sex, to which Neil Howe replied that they [...] "are probably generalizations not even {{as effective as}} a generation {{to say something about}} how people think and behave. One of the things <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> that most historians never look at history in terms of generations. They prefer to tell history as a seamless row of 55-year-old leaders who always tend to think and behave the same way -- but they don't and they never have. If you look at the way America's 55-year-old leaders were acting in the 1960s -- you know, the ebullient and confidence of the JFKs and LBJs and Hubert Humphreys -- and compare them with today's leaders in Congress -- the indecision, the lack of sure-footedness -- I think you would have to agree that 55-year-olds do not always act the same way and you're dealing with powerful generational forces at work that explain why one generation of war veterans, war heroes, and another generation which came of age in very different circumstances tend to have very different instincts about acting in the world.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Condoleezza Rice criticized Spain for {{not doing}} more to support dissidents in {{communist}} Cuba. American officials were irked {{by the fact that}} Miguel Ángel Moratinos, Minister of Foreign Affairs, chose not to meet with Cuban dissidents during a visit to the United States in April 2007. [...] "There is no secret that we have had differences with Spain on a number of issues, but we have also had very good cooperation with Spain on a number of issues", Rice remarked. Moratinos defended his decision, believing it better to engage with the Cuban regime than by isolating it. [...] "The U.S. established its embargo", he remarked. [...] "We don't agree with it but we respect it. What we hope is that they respect our policy", Moratinos remarked. [...] "What Spain is not prepared to do is be absent from Cuba. And what the U.S. has <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> that, given they have no relations with Cuba, they should trust in a faithful, solid ally like Spain."

2500|$|Representatives Ed Royce, the {{chairman}} of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Eliot Engel, members of different parties released a statement that read:The decision by the Egyptian military to take state authority {{out of the hands of}} the ruling Muslim Brotherhood government marks another sharp turning point in Egypt's incomplete revolution. [...] What the Brotherhood neglected <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> that democracy means more than simply holding elections. [...] Real democracy requires inclusiveness, compromise, respect for human and minority rights, and a commitment to the rule of law. [...] Morsi and his inner circle did not embrace any of these principles and instead chose to consolidate power and rule by fiat. [...] As a result the Egyptian people and their economy suffered greatly. It is now up to the Egyptian military to demonstrate that the new transitional government can and will govern in a transparent manner and work to return the country to democratic rule. [...] We are encouraged that a broad cross-section of Egyptians will gather to rewrite the constitution. [...] All parties in Egypt must show restraint, prevent violence, and prepare to be productive players in the future democratic Egypt. [...] We encourage the military to exercise extreme caution moving forward and support sound democratic institutions through which the people and future governments can flourish.|$|E
