He immediately felt that Shreyas Talpade, whom he knew of knowing mimicry, could be used for bahuroopiya.

5|$|Continuing their explorations, {{they reach}} a {{universe}} where humans are subservient to dogs. Stewie finally figures {{out how to}} modify the remote device {{so that they can}} return home; but Brian, overwhelmed by <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> world run by dogs like himself, is reluctant to leave and steals the remote. Stewie and Brian fight over the device, ultimately breaking it, which traps them in the alternative universe. In desperation, the two go to the universe's version of the Griffin family– who are all dogs except for their pet Brian, who is human– hoping to find a solution. The dog version of Stewie quickly confronts the two, revealing that he has also developed a universe-traveling device {{that would allow them to}} return to their own universe. Before Dog Stewie can fetch them his remote control, Human Stewie bites the dog version of his father, Peter, and is sent to the pound where he is to be euthanized later that day. The two Brians and Dog Stewie go to the human pound to free him, and both Stewie and Brian are sent back to their original universe. As they are being transported, human Brian, dreaming of a better life in a world of intelligent inhabitants, leaps into the inter-universe portal at the last moment and successfully makes it to the original universe with the other two. Excited about his new prospects in life, human Brian begins his optimistic adventure in a brand new universe but is quickly struck by a car.|$|E

Following Tánh's death, one of his generals, Ngô Tòng Châu, drank poisoned wine and another, Nguyễn Tấn Huyên, self-immolated. Afterwards, the citadel defenders surrendered to the Tây Sơn and Trần Quang Diệu spared all the Nguyễn captives. Moreover, Dieu ordered his men to build a tomb for Võ Tánh and his generals.|$|E

25|$|A two-year {{cycle of}} Readings was provided, to which {{thematic}} titles were given. These proved not very hardwearing - {{they did not}} always adequately reflect the readings and were considered too narrow in their scope; It {{was not long before}} priests, if not parishioners, noticed that in spite of the huge increase in the amount of Scripture heard - there were now three readings, Old Testament, New Testament and Gospel, much was missed out. When the reading aloud of the Bible at home and Scripture as the basis of Religious Education were the rule, this may not have mattered; people's general knowledge of the Bible was broader. Now that both had disappeared it did. Moreover, the readings jumped from book to book week by week following the themes. It was not therefore possible to follow <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular biblical writer, something that was noted by the Liturgical Commission and was corrected in the ASBs successor, Common Worship. The book was also the high point of Tractarian influence: apart from retaining something of the Four Action Shape of Gregory Dix, there were set lections for the Blessing of An Abbot, for Those Taking Vows and for Vocations to Religious Communities. These were to disappear in 2000. The same applied to the Saints who would no longer be distinguished as to whether they were Martyrs, Teachers or Confessors. There was a good range of Prefaces to the Eucharistic Prayers, including one for St. Michael and All Angels (for which festival there is now no such provision).|$|E

500|$|Landis {{had been}} a lawyer with a {{corporate}} practice; upon his elevation to the bench, corporate litigants expected him to favor them.

[...] In an early case, Landis fined the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company the maximum $4,000 for illegally importing workers, even though Winifred Landis's sister's husband served on the corporate board. In another decision, Landis struck down {{a challenge to the}} Interstate Commerce Commission's (ICC) jurisdiction over rebating, a practice banned by the Elkins Act of 1903 in which railroads and favored customers agreed that the customers would pay less than the posted tariff, which by law was to be the same for all shippers. Landis's decision allowed the ICC to take action against railroads which gave rebates.|$|E
500|$|The {{reforms of}} the Great Sejm responded to the {{increasingly}} perilous situation of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, only a century earlier a major European power and indeed the largest state on the continent. By the 18th century the Commonwealth's state machinery became increasingly dysfunctional; the government was near collapse, giving rise to the term [...] "Polish anarchy", and the country was managed by provincial assemblies and magnates. Many historians hold that {{a major cause of}} the Commonwealth's downfall was the peculiar parliamentary institution of the liberum veto ("free veto"), which since 1652 had in principle permitted any Sejm deputy to nullify all the legislation that had been adopted by that Sejm. By the early 18th century, the magnates of Poland and Lithuania controlled the state – or rather, they managed to ensure that no reforms would be carried out that might weaken their privileged status (the [...] "Golden Freedoms"). The matters were not helped by the inefficient monarchs elected to the Commonwealth throne around the start of the 18th century, nor by neighboring countries, which were content with the deteriorated state of the Commonwealth's affairs and abhorred <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> resurgent and democratic power on their borders.|$|E

500|$|... 20th Century Fox, Gracie Films, and Film Roman {{produced}} an animated The Simpsons film that {{was released on}} July 27, 2007. The production staff of The Simpsons had entertained <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> film since early in the series, but production never came together. Groening felt a feature-length film {{would allow them to}} increase the show's scale and animate sequences too complex for a TV series. The film was directed by David Silverman and written by a team of Simpsons writers comprising Groening, Brooks, Jean, Reiss, Mirkin, Scully, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, Matt Selman, and Ian Maxtone-Graham. Work continued on the screenplay from 2003 onwards and did not cease, taking place in the small bungalow where Groening first pitched The Simpsons in 1987. Groening read about a town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply, which inspired the plot of the film. He also wanted to make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode, as [...] "we wanna really give you something that you haven't seen before." [...] Production of the film occurred alongside continued writing of the series despite long-time claims by those involved in the show that a film would enter production only after the series had concluded.|$|E
