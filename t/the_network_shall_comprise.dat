40|$|Abstract—The {{standardization}} for {{the fifth}} generation (5 G) of mobile and wireless networks is at its early phase and has recently completed the first study item in Release 14. Nevertheless, there is a consensus that 5 G will address the diverse service requirements of high-variety use cases. <b>The</b> <b>network</b> <b>shall</b> cope with such variation effectively and cost-efficiently even though the requirements can change over space and time. The design of the radio topology for the peak service demand is, thus, not desirable for network operators. As a consequence, the trend is towards more flexible network deployment. In this context, dynamic radio topology through vehicular nomadic nodes (VNNs) is an emerging concept towards 5 G to efficiently address non-uniformly distributed traffic. VNNs are aimed to overcome the lack of flexibility induced by small cells that are deployed at fixed locations via network planning in current wireless networks. A VNN is a low-power access node with wireless self-backhaul, which can be activated temporarily to provide additional system capacity and/or coverage on demand. VNNs can be integrated into vehicles, e. g., in car-sharing fleets. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of radio access network (RAN) moderation of VNNs in a multi-cell environment considering composite fading/shadowing environments with co-channel interference, where active VNNs are selected from a set of available candidate VNNs based on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) on the wireless backhaul link. The results show that RAN moderation can significantly improve the end-to-end rate and SINR performances along with clear amount-of-fading (AoF) reduction...|$|R
