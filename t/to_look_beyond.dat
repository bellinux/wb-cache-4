25|$|Most genes {{have more}} than one effect on the {{phenotype}} of an organism (pleiotropism). Some of these effects may be visible, and others cryptic, so it is often important <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>beyond</b> the most obvious effects of a gene to identify other effects. Cases occur where a gene affects an unimportant visible character, yet a change in fitness is recorded. In such cases the gene's other (cryptic or 'physiological') effects may be responsible for the change in fitness. Pleiotropism is posing continual challenges for many clinical dysmorphologists in their attempt to explain birth defects which affect one or more organ system, with only a single underlying causative agent. For many pleiotropic disorders, the connection between the gene defect and the various manifestations is neither obvious, nor well understood.|$|E

His earlier experience with tuberculosis prompted him <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>beyond</b> neurosurgery into other areas of the body, and his work in fighting tuberculosis led to the refining of thoracic surgery. When World War I began, Archibald went with the Third Canadian General Hospital to France, where he was able to apply his experience in combating the disease to the patients he encountered on the war front. The surgeon was also greatly interested in the education of new surgeons, and believed that the standard of doctor education had been declining, leaving incapable surgeons to perform procedures. Archibald returned to McGill University, this time as a staff member in the Department of Surgery, and revitalised it following almost thirty years of stagnation. In 1929, he served as a member of the first Royal College of Surgeons of Canada Examining Board in Surgery, and after becoming President of the American Surgical Association in 1935, made a speech entitled Higher Degrees in the Profession of Surgery, triggering the formation of the American Board of Surgery. He was also considered a key influence in the surgical education of Norman Bethune, however he reportedly disapproved of Bethune and his actions. Additionally, he was a mentor to Wilder Penfield, another famous physician who worked at the Royal Victoria Hospital.|$|E
25|$|The decades between 1780 and 1830 feature several {{characteristics}} at Râmnic. The {{traditions of}} spiritual, cultural and artistic life were continued, with war-damaged churches repaired and new ones {{built in a}} manner that balanced a post-Brâncovenesc style with folk art innovations. The monasteries and the diocesan center continued to educate calligraphers, copyists, miniaturists, painters and musicians. The diocesan printing press was continued, albeit with difficulties and interruptions. Bishop Filaret, after being elected metropolitan, took the printing instruments with him to use at Bucharest. His successor Nectarie rebuilt the press, turning out twenty books, including a collection of sermons in Bulgarian for that country's believers; he followed as metropolitan in 1812. Galaction (1812-1824) published few books, but these were important, including a re-edited alphabet book in 1814 and a book on the miracles of the Virgin Mary in 1820. Neofit, who took over in 1824, sold the press to a group of laymen. (The current press dates to the time of Bishop Vartolomeu (1920-1938).) Bishop Calinic (1850-1868), whose reign coincided with the formation of the modern Romanian state, was the diocese's pre-eminent leader during the 19th century; his successors did not rise to the same spiritual level and were privy to the definitive imposition of government authority upon the church. Calinic set up his own press and published a number of liturgical and spiritual books, including a lamentation in verse, a collection of advice for monks and a chronicle on the Wallachian uprising of 1821. He also disseminated word of the government order replacing Greek with Romanian for liturgical use. Finally, local writers began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>beyond</b> the confines of the diocese, dealing with themes of national interest and making themselves known in the Romanian cultural and literary scene of the day.|$|E

Marsh-Lockett writes that everyone sees Rosa as Lionel Burger's daughter with duties and responsibilities to her father, and not Rosa the individual. In fulfilling these expectations, she denies herself an identity of her own. JanMohamed says it is only when Conrad encourages her <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>beyond</b> her self-sacrifices that Rosa starts examining the conflicts in her life, namely her commitment to help others versus her desire for a private life. In an attempt to resolve these conflicts, Rosa contemplates turning to blacks, but she is wary of this because, according to the book's anonymous narrator, white South Africans tend to use blacks as a way [...] "of perceiving sensual redemption, as romantics do, or of perceiving fears, as racialists do". JanMohamed notes that Rosa's father was a romantic who established genuine friendships with blacks to overcome his [...] "sensual redemption", but she is unsure of where she stands. Visel says that Rosa's only way to free herself from these commitments to her family and the revolution is to [...] "defect" [...] and go to France.

At the time, Khánh was also secretly negotiating with the communists, hoping {{to put together a}} peace deal so he could expel the Americans from Vietnam, although this effort did not lead anywhere in the two months before he was forced out of power. For his part, Taylor privately told Americans journalists that Khánh was expressing opposition to the US merely because he knew he had lost Washington's confidence. Taylor said Khánh was completely unprincipled and was stirring up anti-American sentiment purely to try to shore up his political prospects, not because he thought US policy was harmful to South Vietnam. The US media were generally very critical of Khánh's actions and did not blame Taylor for the disharmony. Peter Grose of The New York Times said [...] "It almost seems as if Viet Cong insurgents and the Saigon government conspired to make the United States feel unwelcome." [...] The Chicago Tribune lampooned Khánh's junta, calling it a [...] "parody of a government" [...] and saying it would not survive for a week without US support and describing the generals as [...] "remittance men on the United States' payroll". However, the New York Herald Tribune said it was dangerous to pressure South Vietnam too much, citing the instability that followed the American support for the coup against Diệm, who had resisted US advice so often.

40|$|This paper critiques {{three schools}} of {{international}} art scholarship and their relevance to Australian Aboriginal art from remote communities. These schools are primitivism, histories of ornament and aesthetic theory. This {{is with a}} view <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>beyond</b> accounts of Aboriginal art as representational, and toward a cross-cultural and sensual account of its practice. While primitivism influenced the scholarship on high art, histories of ornament and aesthetic theory offer new approaches to this art, and new {{ways of thinking about}} Aboriginal painting. The paper partly argues that the extensive influence of primitivism has prevented these latter areas of study in having much impact on the study of Aboriginal art, as critics attend to the inequitable relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous societies. Instead, the interest of ornament and cross- cultural aesthetics in the visual rather than socio-economic and postcolonial conditions of artistic production conceives of a more equitable exchange between cultures, and a revised account of modern visual practices...|$|R
