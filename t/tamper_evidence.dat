In order to achieve trust and security in this environment not only cryptographic algorithms are needed, but also secure methods for generation and storage of secret keys.

40|$|Abstract. Using a Physically Unclonable Function or PUF {{to extract}} a secret key from the unique {{submicron}} {{structure of a}} device, instead of storing it in non-volatile memory, provides interesting advantages like physical unclonability and <b>tamper</b> <b>evidence.</b> However, an additional Helper Data Algorithm (HDA) is required {{to deal with the}} fuzziness of the PUF’s responses. To provide a viable alternative to costly protected non-volatile memory, the PUF+HDA construction should have a very low overhead. In this work, we propose the first HDA design using soft-decision information providing an implementation that occupies 44. 8 % less resources than previous proposals. Moreover, the required size of the used PUF can be reduced upto 58. 4 % due to the smaller entropy loss...|$|E

We define several variants of tamper-evidence, differing in their power to detect tampering.

We provide tamper-evident schemes for all the variants and prove their optimality. Achieving the strongest <b>tamper</b> <b>evidence</b> turns out to be provably expensive.

Our α-te schemes use a combinatorial construction of α-separating sets, which might be of independent interest. We stress that our mechanisms are purely cryptographic: the tamper-detection algorithm Div is stateless and takes no inputs except the two signatures (in particular, it keeps no logs), we use no infrastructure (or other ways to conceal additional secrets), and we use no hardware properties (except those implied by the standard cryptographic assumptions, such as random number generators).

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose the}} notion of {{tamper-evident}} stabilization –that combines stabilization {{with the concept of}} tamper evidence– for computing systems. On the first glance, these notions are contradictory; stabilization requires that eventually the system functionality is fully restored whereas <b>tamper</b> <b>evidence</b> requires that the system functionality is permanently degraded in the event of tampering. Tamper-evident stabilization captures the intuition that the system will tolerate perturbation upto a limit. In the event that it is perturbed beyond that limit, it will exhibit permanent evidence of tampering, where it may provide reduced (possibly none) functionality. We compare tamper-evident stabilization with (conventional) stabilization and with active stabilization and propose an approach to verify tamper-evident stabilizing programs in polynomial time. We demonstrate tamper-evident stabilization with two examples and argue how approaches for designing stabilization can be used to design tamper-evident stabilization. We also study issues of composition in tamper-evident stabilization. Finally, we point out how tamper-evident stabilization can effectively be used to provide tradeoff between fault-prevention and fault tolerance...|$|E

40|$|Reliability and {{sensitive}} information protection are critical aspects of integrated circuits. A novel technique using near-field evanescent wave coupling from two subwavelength gratings (SWGs), with the input laser source delivered through an optical fiber is presented for <b>tamper</b> <b>evidence</b> of electronic components. The first grating {{of the pair}} of coupled subwavelength gratings (CSWGs) was milled directly on the output facet of the silica fiber using focused ion beam (FIB) etching. The second grating was patterned using e-beam lithography and etched into a glass substrate using reactive ion etching (RIE). The slightest intrusion attempt would separate the CSWGs and eliminate near-field coupling between the gratings. Tampering, therefore, would become evident. ^ Computer simulations guided the design for optimal operation of the security solution. The physical dimensions of the SWGs, i. e. period and thickness, were optimized, for a 650 nm illuminating wavelength. The optimal dimensions resulted in a 560 nm grating period for the first grating etched in the silica optical fiber and 420 nm for the second grating etched in borosilicate glass. The incident light beam had a half-width at half-maximum (HWHM) of at least 7 µm to allow discernible higher transmission orders, and a HWHM of 28 µm for minimum noise. The minimum number of individual grating lines present on the optical fiber facet was identified as 15 lines. Grating rotation due to the cylindrical geometry of the fiber resulted in a rotation of the far-field pattern, corresponding to the rotation angle of moiré fringes. With the goal of later adding authentication to <b>tamper</b> <b>evidence,</b> the concept of CSWGs signature was also modeled by introducing random and planned variations in the glass grating. ^ The fiber was placed on a stage supported by a nanomanipulator, which permitted three-dimensional displacement while maintaining the fiber tip normal {{to the surface of}} the glass substrate. A 650 nm diode laser was fixed to a translation mount that transmitted the light source through the optical fiber, and the output intensity was measured using a silicon photodiode. The evanescent wave coupling output results for the CSWGs were measured and compared to the simulation results. ...|$|E
40|$|Physical unclonable {{functions}} (PUFs) are physical {{structures that}} are hard to clone and have a unique challenge-response behavior. The term PUF was coined by Pappu et al. in 2001. That work triggered a lot of interest, and since then a substantial number of papers {{has been written about the}} use of a wide variety of physical structures for different security purposes such as identification, authentication, read-proof key storage, key distribution, <b>tamper</b> <b>evidence,</b> anti-counterfeiting, software-to-hardware binding and trusted computing. In this paper we propose a new security primitive: the quantum-readout PUF (QR-PUF). This is a classical PUF, without internal quantum degrees of freedom, which is challenged using a quantum state, e. g. a single-photon state, and whose response is also a quantum state. By the no-cloning property of unknown quantum states, attackers cannot intercept challenges or responses without noticeably disturbing the readout process. Thus, a verifier who sends quantum states as challenges and receives the correct quantum states back can be certain that he is probing a specific QR-PUF without disturbances, even if the QR-PUF is far away 2 ̆ 2 in the field 2 ̆ 2 and under hostile control. For PUFs whose information content is not exceedingly large, all currently known PUF-based authentication and anti-counterfeiting schemes require trusted readout devices in the field. Our quantum readout scheme has no such requirement. Furthermore, we show how the QR-PUF authentication scheme can be interwoven with quantum key exchange (QKE), leading to an authenticated QKE protocol between two parties. This protocol has the special property that it requires no a priori secret shared by the two parties, and that the quantum channel is the authenticated channel, allowing for an unauthenticated classical channel. We provide security proofs for a limited class of attacks. The proofs depend on the physical unclonability of PUFs and on the practical infeasibility of building a quantum computer...|$|E
40|$|Logging is {{a central}} service in {{computing}} systems. It collects information about the events happening in distributed devices and, thus, provides a basis for other services within the system. In highly dynamic, mixed-mode systems, logging takes a new dimension: resource-poor devices need to securely relocate log data to resource-rich collectors not necessarily residing within the same trust domain. This scenario brings several challenges to logging, in particular regarding its security requirements. In this paper, we report on ongoing work in developing a logging mechanism to securely store log data in marginally trusted remote collectors. Characterizing Secure Log The need for secure logging mechanisms is evident. But, irrespective of the envisaged application of log data, it must be authentic, for ex falsum quod libet, i. e., from a falsity everything follows. However, the increasing distribution and openness of computing systems pose challenges to logging, in particular if the device notifying the events {{is not the same}} as the service storing this data. In this context, while the device’s log data is stored in partially trusted collectors, accurate security guarantees regarding the authenticity of log data should not only hold, but also be proved to the device. We define authenticity of log-data as the conjunction of faithfulness and uniqueness: while the former denotes that the information logged is a faithful representation of the messages sent by the device, the latter requires that log data shall not allow for parallel realities. Furthermore, log services based providing these properties need to fulfill two other requirements, namely: <b>tamper</b> <b>evidence,</b> i. e. attempts to illicitly modify log data must be detectable to a verifier [4]; and forward integrity, that is, should contain sufficient information to confirm or rebuke allegations of log data modification before the moment of the compromise [1]. The approach we propose aims at fulfilling these properties. Attacks upon log services have different facets.
