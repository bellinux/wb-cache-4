40|$|We {{document}} {{a negative}} <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> the leisure of men married to women aged 25 - 45, relative {{to that of}} their wives, and a positive <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> relative housework. Taken together, these trends rule out a popular class of labor supply models in which unitary households maximize {{the sum of the}} spouse’s utility. We develop a simple bargaining model of marriage, divorce and allocations of leisure-time and housework. According to the model, a rise in women’s relative wage will reduce husband’s leisure and marriage rates when the quality of single life is relatively high for women. Calibration to US data shows the <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> relative wages explains most of the <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> relative leisure and {{about a third of the}} <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> housework, while the simultaneous <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> home-durables prices explains the balance of the housework trend.

40|$|Some {{important}} recent {{findings in}} climate studies are the warming <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> the troposphere and the cooling <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> the stratosphere. However, {{the evidence for}} the cooling <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> the stratosphere {{may need to be}} revisited. This study presents evidence that the strato-sphere is slightly warming since 1996. Using long-term Stratosphere Sounding Unit (SSU) measurements at channels 1 and 2 before 1996, we did obtain a cooling <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> the middle and upper parts of stratosphere similar to the findings for the lower stratosphere in lit-erature (Ramaswamy et al. 2001; Fu et al. 2004). But, we also found that the temperature <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> the middle and upper stratosphere has alternated to warming since 1996. We also analyzed a time series of the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) channel 4 brightness tempera-tures between 1978 and 2006 and found the same re-versing <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> the lower stratosphere. The reversing trend may relate to a possible recovery of stratospheric ozone concentration. 1...|$|R

40|$|Only a {{few studies}} have tried to {{estimate}} the <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> the elasticity of children’s economic status with respect to parents’ economic status, and these studies produce conflicting results. In an attempt to reconcile these findings, we use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to estimate the <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> the elasticity of son’s income with respect to parental income. Our evidence suggests a nonlinear <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> which the elasticity increased for sons born between 1949 and 1953, and then declined for sons born after that. Thus depending on the time periods one compares, the trend could be upward, downward, or flat. This and other factors help explain the different estimates for the <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> mobility. ...|$|R

40|$|Trends and {{variability}} of annual precipitation total, annual number of rainy days and two climate change related precipitation indices named Simple Daily Intensity Index (SDII) and Precipitation Concentration Index (PCI) {{have been investigated}} in this study. The analysis was based on daily and monthly precipitation data of 35 observatory stations all over Bangladesh for the study period of 1971 - 2010. Mann Kendall test was performed to detect the trend and Sen’s slope method to de-termine the magnitude of change.

40|$|Twenty {{years ago}} there were large {{disagreements}} between instruments measuring stratospheric H 2 O and NO 2, {{and there were no}} reliable long-term records. Now, there is greatly improved agreement between techniques, there are 20 -year records of profiles of stratospheric H 2 O and of total NO 2 at single sites, there is a qualified H 2 O record extending back 40 years and 12 -year records of total NO 2 from many sites, and there are reliable global measurements from satellites to form the basis of climatologies. This excellent progress is marred by a discrepancy between the observed <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> lower stratospheric H 2 O and temperatures at the tropical cold point, and by a possible discrepancy between the observed <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> total NO 2 and the <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> the source of NO 2.
