As the majority of 'Winton's Children' (as <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be known) were Jewish, it is believed this saved them from certain death had they stayed in Czechoslovakia. As of 2009, the direct descendants of Winton's Children numbered over 5000 people.|$|E

Local journalists and researchers have since suggested various theories on the origins of the Eskaya but there is still no broad consensus on the subject.|$|E

5|$|Friedrich Kellner was {{a justice}} {{inspector}} {{in the courthouse}} in Mainz between 1903 and 1933. From 1914 until 1918, {{he served as a}} soldier in the German army.

5|$|Part of the {{conflict}} between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstar's frustration with Team Bondi's direction, and eventually Team Bondi's management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control.

5|$|The {{psychoanalyst}} Richard Sterba {{wrote in}} 1982 that Reich {{had been a}} brilliant clinician and teacher in the 1920s; even the older analysts had wanted to attend his technical seminars in Vienna. But according to Sharaf, <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> consider Reich as paranoid and belligerent. Psychologist Luis Cordon wrote that Reich's slide from respectability concluded with the consensus {{inside and outside the}} psychoanalytic community that he was at best a crackpot and perhaps seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, {{on a summer}} day, horses {{that belonged to the}} Monastery of StJovan Vladimir.

They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves realized that this was a miracle of the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E
5|$|Another origin tale {{claims that}} King Solomon {{was given a}} pure Arabian-type mare named Safanad ("the pure") by the Queen of Sheba.

This legendary stallion was said to be faster than the zebra and the gazelle, and every hunt with him was successful, thus when he was put to stud, he became a founding sire of legend.|$|E

Her bottom was badly damaged and she was deemed no longer seaworthy after repairs were completed at Kure Naval Arsenal. The ship was then assigned as a stationary training ship for the Kure Naval Corps on 5 July 1938.|$|E
5|$|Besides clockwork, hydraulic-powered armillary spheres, odometers, and {{mechanical}} compass vehicles, {{there were other}} impressive devices of mechanical engineering found during the Song dynasty. Although literary references for mechanical revolving repositories and book cases of Buddhist temples trace back to at least 823 during the Tang dynasty, <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> prominence during the Song dynasty. The invention of the revolving book case is considered to have happened earlier, and is credited to the layman Fu Xi in 544. Revolving bookcases were popularized in Buddhist monasteries during the Song dynasty under the reign of Emperor Taizu, who ordered the mass printing of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka scriptures.|$|E
