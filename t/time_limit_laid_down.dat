We have been unable to go in for care-free rejoicing. We have felt {{that we are in the}} midst of a tragedy. We have felt humiliation. This has not been a victory for reason and humanity. It has been a victory for brute force. At every stage of the proceedings there have been <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> <b>laid</b> <b>down</b> by the owner and ruler of armed force. The terms have not been terms negotiated; they have been terms <b>laid</b> <b>down</b> as ultimata.

We have seen the cause of democracy, which is, in our view, the cause of civilisation and humanity, receive a terrible defeat. ... The events of these last few days constitute one of the greatest diplomatic defeats that this country and France have ever sustained. There can be no doubt that it is a tremendous victory for Herr Hitler. Without firing a shot, by the mere display of military force, he has achieved a dominating position in Europe which Germany failed to win after four years of war. He has overturned the balance of power in Europe. He has destroyed the last fortress of democracy in Eastern Europe which stood in the way of his ambition. He has opened his way to the food, the oil and the resources which he requires in order to consolidate his military power, and he has successfully defeated and reduced to impotence the forces that might have stood against the rule of violence.|$|R

Nonetheless a strong president could exercise authority beyond the <b>limits</b> <b>laid</b> <b>down</b> in the 1922 constitution. The president's weak position arose {{from the fact that}} the status of his office was modelled on that of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom before 1918. Until 1918, the British prime minister's powers had been theoretically quite limited and, as a member of the cabinet, the office-holder was regarded strictly as primus inter pares. Under Prime Minister David Lloyd George, however, from 1918 onwards, the powers of the office increased, as Lloyd George unilaterally claimed for himself powers that had previously belonged to the Cabinet collectively, including, most dramatically, the right to seek a parliamentary dissolution.|$|R

Like in several other African countries, a debate has arisen around the eligibility of the incumbent president at the next presidential elections.

On the one hand, attention is paid to the presidential term <b>limit</b> <b>laid</b> <b>down</b> in the Constitution (including to the provision possibly allowing for a third term). On the other, an analysis is made of the impact of (currently applicable and draft) transitional justice legislation on the possible candidacy of President Nkurunziza.

It also highlights the crucial role of the Constitutional Court in clarifying several of the unanswered issues highlighted throughout the paper. More generally, the case-study addressed in this paper shows the complexity of the important linkages between post-conflict elections, peace accords, power-sharing and transitional justice. ...|$|R
