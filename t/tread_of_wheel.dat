40|$|Roughness (corrugation, waviness) on the <b>tread</b> <b>of</b> {{a rolling}} railway wheel leads to {{vibrations}} in wheels, bogies and superstructure {{and also in}} rails, sleepers and roadbed. These vibrating components radiate noise to the surroundings. A lowering of the noise levels from tread braked freight cars is of utmost importance {{for the future of}} rail traffic. The thermomechanical interaction between brake block and wheel tread during braking has been found to cause hot spots on the wheel tread. This phenomenon is believed to be a main contributor to the development <b>of</b> a wavy <b>tread</b> surface. Due to thermal expansion of the rim material, the hot spots will protrude from the wheel tread and be more exposed to wear during the wheel/block contact than the rest <b>of</b> the <b>tread</b> surface.

40|$|<b>Tread</b> braking <b>of</b> railway <b>wheels</b> {{results in}} the kinetic energy of the train being {{dissipated}} into the wheel and blocks {{in the form of}} heat. This heat is further conducted into adjacent structures, notably the cold rail, and also transferred into the surroundings by convection and radiation. Heat partitioning between wheel and block is, for short time periods, controlled by local thermal interactions at the contact point and by the conductive properties of the bodies. However, for a metro train that performs longer periods of intermittent braking (or for drag braking) convective and radiation cooling properties of the components come into play. In the present study, results from brake rig tests and from in-field testing of a metro train are presented and used to calibrate a simulation model.

50|$|Their {{construction}} was a wooden plank, around two feet long. It rode {{on a single}} double-flanged wheel, with a V-shaped iron slipper on {{the rear of the}} plank. It was balanced by an iron outrigger to one side, with a pipe-shaped roller over its end. This wide roller also allowed for slight variations in gauge. To control the car there was a hand brake. Pulling upwards on this applied an iron brake to the <b>tread</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wheel.</b> Despite the simplicity of the idea, the cars were not unsophisticated in their manufacture. Most was made by the smith, but the cast wheel was made by a foundry in Portmadoc. The brake linkage comprised several pieces, each hand-forged. The brake handle was detachable and fitted over the main lever. It was decoratively forged with a lightweight curve. When not in use it was carried in the quarryman's pocket, a primitive form of anti-theft measure. This could have tragic consequences; one of the few fatal accidents was to children in the 1920s who crashed into a slate wagon through not having the brake handle. For reasons of safety, later operation of the cars became more organised, a responsible mine foreman leading the descent as 'captain', and setting a maximum speed. At times cavalcades of up to two hundred cars would descend in close procession.|$|R
5000|$|The Federal Express {{departed}} Boston at 11:00 P.M. After making two stops, {{the train}} halted about 70 mi south of Boston. Its brakes were sticking, and a 45-minute inspection occurred. Conductors discovered a closed [...] "angle cock" [...] (a shutoff valve) {{at the rear}} of the third car. The airbrake system aboard the rail cars had angle cocks at each end of each car. Both valves had to be open for the airbraking system to operate. The only closed valve would be that {{at the rear of}} the final car. Airbrakes on trains are powered by a compressed air tank aboard each car. The engine generates air pressure that is supposed to flow through the airbrake system along the entire length of the train. When this pressure is lessened, valves on the pressurized air tanks come open. The air from the tanks put pressure on the brake disks (or the <b>tread</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wheel),</b> which push against the wheels and cause braking to occur. If the cars separate, from one another or from the engine, the pressure automatically drops and the cars will brake to a stop. Closing an angle cock at any point along the system keeps the air pressure in the airbrakes high, thereby preventing the engine from reducing the air pressure and activating the braking system.|$|R

40|$|<b>Wheel</b> sets <b>of</b> rail vehicles, {{especially}} of high-speed trains, {{are subject to}} high dynamic loads. In order to detect possible defects {{at an early stage}} the wheel sets have to be inspected periodically applying non-destructive testing techniques.

In close cooperation with industrial partners we have developed methods and equipment for the in-service inspection <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> and axles in maintenance workshops. Stationary systems are used to inspect disassembled wheel sets which have to undergo a refurbishment process. The inspection is run after re-profiling the wheels on a lathe and before final assembly <b>of</b> the <b>wheel</b> set.

High-speed networking techniques ensure the transfer of all the digital ultrasonic and eddy-current data acquired from the front-end modules to the workstation being responsible for data acquisition and analysis.

Two vertically placed rails for the balancing or friction wheels were carried by the upper track beam. The distance from out to out between the lower rails was 22½ inches, this being sufficient to insure the necessary transverse stiffness. This was the gauge of the road. The distance between the upper rails was 17½ inches. It was expected to adopt the common form of rail, beveling the edges of the lower stringers and placing the rail at an angle of about 45 degrees.

Then two different railway wheel designs, with typical characteristics of freight and metro wheels, have been numerically studied with respect to standard design criteria for load cases of drag braking and stop braking. The influence of brake block materials, thermal parameters and brake pressure distribution on the wheel temperatures has been investigated. A general result is that hot spots only have a minor influence on the global heat partitioning in the wheel-block-rail system even though the hot spots have a major impact on local temperatures. Brake rig experiments and a field test campaign were performed and aimed at measuring wheel and brake block temperatures during different service conditions for a metro line. Simulation and calibration tools were employed in order to facilitate a comparison between measured temperatures. The results showed the importance of knowing the convection cooling parameters for different wagons if prolonged braking action is to be considered. In a pin-on-disc experimental study of railway braking materials, the heat partitioning characteristics between wheel and block material at controlled elevated disc temperatures were investigated by a finite element approach where a model was calibrated using measured temperatures. In the final part of the present thesis, a modelling framework was proposed and developed that represents typical conditions in metro and suburban operations, in particular during sequential stop braking.

A health monitoring system based on the interpretation of ultrasonic signatures has been developed. First, the sound waves generated by an artificial defect on the outer <b>tread</b> <b>of</b> a railroad <b>wheel</b> and their propagation towards an acoustic sensor, placed inside the hollow shaft of the axis, were simulated with EFIT (Elastodynamic Finite Integration Technique). The results proved that relevant signals {{can be found in a}} frequency range up to 300 kHz. A diagnostic unit was designed and built for application under rotation conditions, which consists of a piezo-electric sensor, primary electronics, an analog-to-digital converter, a digital signal processor, a trigger unit, and a telemetric transmitter. It was integrated in the hollow shaft <b>of</b> a <b>wheel</b> axis as component of a laboratory test rig. Algorithms which allow for rotation-synchronized signal processing were implemented. After successfully completing a campaign for this test rig, a second test was performed under railroad-like conditions. The detection of artificial defects of different sizes was shown in correlation with theoretical assumptions...|$|R
