Male saltwater crocodiles establish year-round territories that encompass several female nesting sites. Some species are occasionally gregarious, particularly during droughts, when several individuals gather at remaining water sites. Individuals of some species may share basking sites at certain <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

While the area was obviously primarily used for public bathing, one could exercise and enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Attendants were paid to oversee these activities, and the happenings of the complex, enforcing opening and closing times, and the rules of conduct.

5|$|Pied currawongs are vocal birds, calling when {{in flight}} and at all <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> They are more noisy {{early in the morning}} and in the evening before roosting, as well as before rain. The loud {{distinctive}} call has been translated as Kadow-Kadang or Curra-wong, akin to a croak. They also have a loud, high-pitched, wolf-like whistle, transcribed as Wheeo. The endemic Lord Howe Island subspecies has a distinct, more melodious call.|$|E

Other interested parties, such as internet service provider OzEmail argued for the provision of spectrum for interactive services, while Telstra, shareholder in the subscription television provider Foxtel, supported ASTRA's argument for a competitive bidding process for digital spectrum.|$|E
5|$|At a {{labelled}} building, {{the player}} {{can get out}} of the car and enter, though enemies will only appear during certain <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> If the player arrives too early, the enemy gangsters will attempt to escape. If the player arrives too late, the building will be found vacant. A timetable of all meetings are included in the game's instruction manual. The aesthetic interior of buildings include two rooms, with limited decorations such as a pool table and chairs. Some buildings contain evidence bags which can be collected for extra points. Once the player comes into contact with an enemy, a separate window will appear which will display his name. The player can apprehend him by either catching or trapping him. Once caught, the player may take him to the city hall to interrogate him in order to receive information such as the location of the next gangster meetup. Points are gained by apprehending criminals, returning evidence bags or destroying cars.|$|E

5|$|Four <b>Times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Day</b> is {{a series}} of four {{paintings}} by English artist William Hogarth. Completed in 1736, they were reproduced as a series of four engravings published in 1738. They are humorous depictions of life in the streets of London, the vagaries of fashion, and the interactions between the rich and poor. Unlike many of Hogarth's other series, such as A Harlot's Progress, A Rake's Progress, Industry and Idleness, and The Four Stages of Cruelty, it does not depict the story of an individual, but instead focuses on the society of the city. Hogarth intended the series to be humorous rather than instructional; the pictures do not offer a judgment on whether the rich or poor are more deserving of the viewer's sympathies: while the upper and middle classes tend to provide the focus for each scene, there are fewer of the moral comparisons seen in some of his other works.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{designed}} the series for an original commission by Jonathan Tyers in 1736 {{in which he}} requested a number of paintings to decorate supper boxes at Vauxhall Gardens. Hogarth {{is believed to have}} suggested to Tyers that the supper boxes at Gardens be decorated with paintings as part of their refurbishment; among the works featured when the renovation was completed was Hogarth's picture of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. The originals of Four <b>Times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Day</b> were sold to other collectors, but the scenes were reproduced at Vauxhall by Francis Hayman, and two of them, Evening and Night, hung at the pleasure gardens until at least 1782.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} {{of wind and}} solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur at different <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> and year. The power generation of such solar hybrid power systems is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than {{each of the two}} component subsystems. Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric. The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power from renewable sources.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes in}} Chicago were mostly shot on location, as Bay {{believed}} the plates had {{to really be}} shot in the actual city. Farrar was always fascinated {{with the idea of}} shooting on location, and then blending the film with computer-generated imagery. The visual effects team used aerial plates of the city's actual buildings and added destruction elements such as smoke, fire, debris, fighter planes, war, battles, and torn up streets. Four ILM employees also travelled to Chicago and photographed buildings from top to bottom at six different <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> {{in order to create a}} digital model of the city to be used in certain scenes. ILM's crew designed many major action scenes, with many of the Chicago battle concepts coming from the helicopter shooting of the aerial plates.|$|E
5|$|The tax {{increase}} was implemented {{not only to}} improve accessibility and the environment, but also to help develop the infrastructure. The additional funds will contribute to finance {{the extension of the}} Stockholm metro. As the Stockholm congestion tax varies by time of the day, the highest increase took place at the two busiest rush hour periods, 7:30 to 8:29, and 16:00 to 17:29, from SEK 20 to SEK 30. The objective was to steer the traffic towards other <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> and public transport, and in this way reduce congestion in the Inner City area. Also the maximum amount levied was raised to SEK 105 per day and vehicle.|$|E
5|$|With the city's {{economic}} and budgetary {{recovery in the}} 1990s, there was a revival of efforts to complete construction of the SAS. Rising ridership on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, the only subway trunk line east of Central Park, demonstrated {{the need for the}} Second Avenue Line, as capacity and safety concerns rose. The four-track IRT Lexington Avenue Line, the lone rapid transit option in the Upper East Side and East Harlem since the 1955 closure of the Third Avenue elevated, is the most crowded subway line in the country. The line saw an average of 1.3 million daily riders in 2015; this is more than the daily ridership of the second-busiest subway system in the U.S., the Washington Metro, as well as more than the combined daily riderships of San Francisco's and Boston's transit systems. Local bus routes are just as crowded during various <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> with the paralle M15 local and M15 Select Bus Service routes seeing 46,000 passengers per weekday in 2016, translating to 14.5 million passengers yhat year.|$|E
