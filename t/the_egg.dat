5|$|In Digital Devil Saga 2, the Embryon {{appear in}} the real world, which is slowly being {{destroyed}} by the Black Sun: the only ones able to survive the sun's rays are those infected with the demon virus. Serph, Cielo, Argilla and Gale learn that Sera is the captive of Angel and Madame Cuvier at the Karma Society headquarters. With the help of Roland and a young boy named Fred, the group infiltrate the Karma Society's building. While they attempt to rescue Serah, Angel plans to subvert Cuvier and use the demon virus to create a society ruled by the strong. The Embryon are also faced by Heat, who is working with Cuvier {{on the promise of}} Sera's safety. Reaching <b>the</b> <b>EGG,</b> a man-made replica of God, the party rescue Sera, but Heat appears and seems to kill Serph. Both fall into <b>the</b> <b>EGG,</b> and God begins absorbing the Earth's data: in the chaos, Angel kills Cuvier, while the remaining Embryon and Sera, now able to assume a demon form herself, shut down the Power Plant in an unsuccessful attempt to stop <b>the</b> <b>EGG.</b> In the process, both Roland and Argilla are killed by a powerful demon. Returning to <b>the</b> <b>EGG</b> so Sera can speak with God, they are confronted by Heat, who has fused with <b>the</b> <b>EGG</b> and gone berserk. Inside <b>the</b> <b>EGG,</b> Serph is met by a higher being calling itself Schrödinger, who reveals the truth about what happened.|$|E

5|$|The identification, in 2000, of a {{probable}} Deinonychus egg associated {{with one of}} the original specimens allowed comparison with other theropod dinosaurs in terms of egg structure, nesting, and reproduction. In their 2006 examination of the specimen, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky examined the possibility that the dromaeosaurid had been feeding on <b>the</b> <b>egg,</b> or that <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> fragments had been associated with the Deinonychus skeleton by coincidence. They dismissed the idea that <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> had been a meal for the theropod, noting that the fragments were sandwiched between the belly ribs and forelimb bones, making it impossible that they represented contents of the animal's stomach. In addition, the manner in which <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> had been crushed and fragmented indicated that it had been intact at the time of burial, and was broken by the fossilization process. The idea that <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> was randomly associated with the dinosaur was also found to be unlikely; the bones surrounding <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> had not been scattered or disarticulated, but remained fairly intact relative to their positions in life, indicating that the area around and including <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> was not disturbed during preservation. The fact that these bones were belly ribs (gastralia), which are very rarely found articulated, supported this interpretation. All the evidence, according to Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky, indicates that <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> was intact beneath the body of the Deinonychus when it was buried. It is possible that this represents brooding or nesting behavior in Deinonychus similar to that seen in the related troodontids and oviraptorids, or that <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> was in fact inside the oviduct when the animal died.|$|E
5000|$|Macroctopus maorum {{construct}} the posterior mantle to push out <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> during <b>egg</b> laying. <b>The</b> female usually will stop eating for 2 weeks during <b>the</b> laying <b>eggs</b> period {{and continue to}} look after <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> until they hatched.

50|$|Unlike giant water bugs in the {{subfamily}} Belostomatinae, females do not lay <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> on <b>the</b> {{backs of}} males.Instead, after copulation (often multiple sessions) <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> are laid on emergent vegetation (rarely on man-made structures) high enough above the waterline that <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> {{will not be}} permanently submerged. The male then guards <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> from predators and periodically brings water to <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> to prevent their desiccation.|$|R
50|$|Adults pair up {{when they}} are breeding. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> are laid in the substrate. Once <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> are laid, <b>the</b> male guards and aerates <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> until they hatch.|$|R
5|$|The top of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> is {{depressed}} and forms a small central cavity called micropyle through which <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> is fertilised.

5|$|While escaping, {{the newly}} hatched larvae of many species {{sometimes}} eat the chorion to emerge. Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> shell {{may have a}} line of weakness around the cap which gives way allowing the larva to emerge. <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> shell and {{a small amount of}} yolk trapped in the amniotic membranes forms the first food for most lepidopteran larvae.|$|E
5|$|A {{nutritional}} {{analysis of}} P.indusiatus (based on specimens collected from Nigeria) determined that <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> {{stage of the}} fungus contains (per 100g of fungus, dry weight) 33.6g of crude protein, 1.66g of fat, and 3.98g of carbohydrates. <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> stage was also measured to comprise 20.9g dietary fibre, and 88.76% moisture. The high levels of protein and fibre (which are comparable to values found in meat and vegetables, respectively) suggest that <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> form of P.indusiatus is a good food source. The concentration of several mineral elements, including potassium, sodium, and iron, was also favourable compared to fruits and vegetables, although the mineral composition in the fungus is dependent on their corresponding concentrations in the soil in which they grow.|$|E

50|$|During the {{breeding}} season, which generally spans from November to March, the female fish lays multiple batches of 30-1,300 <b>eggs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> are laid on underwater objects and plants. After <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> are laid, <b>the</b> male fish guards <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> and fans {{them with his}} fins. The young fish hatch from <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> after 3-9 days.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> of S. mansonoides {{provide an}} example of the general {{morphological}} characteristics of Spirometra eggs. S. mansonoides <b>eggs</b> resemble <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> of D. latum, with some specific differences. S. mansonoides eggs measure 57-66 µm by 33-37 µm, which is smaller than <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> of D. latum. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> of S. mansonoides are also ellipsoidal and have a conical, prominent operculum.|$|R
5|$|After {{the female}} lays <b>the</b> <b>egg,</b> the male incubates <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> while the female guards the nest. Males only leave the nest {{for a few}} hours to hunt, and during this time, the female takes over. It takes 75 to 85days for <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> to hatch. The kiwi chick takes 2 to 3 days simply to get out of its egg. Kiwi chicks are precocial, and are {{abandoned}} by their parents after hatching. After ten days, chicks venture out of the burrow to hunt. Most chicks are killed by predators {{in the first six months}} of their life. Great spotted kiwis reach full size at year six. Unlike most birds, female great spotted kiwis have two ovaries. Most birds have only one. Great spotted kiwis are distinguishable from other kiwi species by the fact that they can only produce one egg a year, as it takes so much energy to produce the massive egg.|$|E
5|$|Back to <b>the</b> <b>Egg</b> is {{the seventh}} and final studio album by the British-American band Wings, {{released}} in 1979 on Columbia Records in America, and on Parlophone in the UK. Co-produced by Chris Thomas, the album reflects band leader Paul McCartney's embracing of contemporary musical trends such as new wave and punk, and marked the arrival of new Wings members Laurence Juber and Steve Holley. Back to <b>the</b> <b>Egg</b> adopts a loose conceptual theme around {{the idea of a}} working band, and its creation coincided with a period of considerable activity for the group, which included making a return to touring and work on several television and film projects.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize <b>the</b> <b>egg.</b> Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E
50|$|The female lays <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> on {{a surface}} {{during the night}} and the male fertilizes them. The male then stays near <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> {{to protect them from}} predators to and ensure fungus does not grow on <b>the</b> <b>eggs.</b> By day 3 the fry can be seen moving within <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> and by day 5 the fry are clearly visible as fish.|$|R
50|$|After four to 19 days <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> hatch. Many predators target <b>the</b> <b>eggs,</b> {{including}} reptiles.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> of a C. sinensis are {{released}} through the biliary tract, and excreted out along with <b>the</b> faeces. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> are embryonated and contain the larvae called miracidia. Unlike most other flukes {{in which the}} miracidia undergo development and swim in water to infect suitable host, <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> of C. sinensis are simply deposited in water. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> are then eaten up by snails.|$|R
5|$|Examination of the Deinonychus egg's {{microstructure}} {{confirms that}} {{it belonged to}} a theropod, since it shares characteristics with other known theropod eggs and shows dissimilarities with ornithischian and sauropod eggs. Compared to other maniraptoran theropods, <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> of Deinonychus is more {{similar to those of}} oviraptorids than to those of troodontids, despite studies that show the latter are more closely related to dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus. While <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> was too badly crushed to accurately determine its size, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky estimated a diameter of about 7cm (2.7in) based on the width of the pelvic canal through which <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> had to have passed. This size is similar to the 7.2cm diameter of the largest Citipati (an oviraptorid) eggs; Citipati and Deinonychus also shared the same overall body size, supporting this estimate. Additionally, the thicknesses of Citipati and Deinonychus eggshells are almost identical, and since shell thickness correlates with egg volume, this further supports the idea that the eggs of these two animals were about the same size.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene of}} Kane {{inspecting}} <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> {{was shot in}} post-production. A fiberglass egg was used so that actor John Hurt could shine his light on it and see movement inside, which was provided by Ridley Scott fluttering his hands inside <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> while wearing rubber gloves. The top of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> was hydraulic, and the innards were a cow's stomach and tripe. Test shots of the eggs were filmed using hen's eggs, and this footage was used in early teaser trailers.

40|$|Eggs of Ancylostoma caninum were soaked for {{different}} periods in varing chemicals, produced spontaneously in sewage, and were placed. on cover glass and sealed with polyethylene film.

When soaked in a 10 % solution of NaNo_ 2 for 48 hours, 62. 3 % of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> showed degeneration. All <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> degenerated when they were soaked in a 20 % solution for over 24 hours; all <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> degenerated when they were soaked in a 40 % solution. Morphologic pictures were as follows on above degenerated eggs. Granulation, destruction, shrinking, dislocation, separation of the blastomeres and abnormal division. 2. All <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> impregnated with NH_ 4 OH of concentrations of 0. 5 % showed degeneration. Morphologic changes consisted mainly of granulation and varing forms of destruction. 3.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> of tessaratomids are {{barrel-shaped}} or globular. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> {{exhibit a}} ring of small protuberances, known as micropylar process, which permit entry of sperm for fertilization into <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> (through micropylar canals).

50|$|Females can lay 35-100 <b>eggs.</b> <b>The</b> greenish-white {{coloured}} <b>eggs</b> {{are laid}} singly in the stems of plants. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> {{could also be}} yellow coloured and can turn red {{by the time of}} hatching.

The incubation of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> takes 15-20 days of summer.|$|R
5|$|The {{social life}} of a crocodilian begins while it is still in <b>the</b> <b>egg,</b> because the young start {{communicating}} with each other before they are hatched. It {{has been shown that}} a light tapping noise near the nest will be repeated by the young, one after another. Such early communication may help them to hatch simultaneously. Once it has broken out of <b>the</b> <b>egg,</b> a juvenile produces yelps and grunts, either spontaneously or as a result of external stimuli and even unrelated adults respond quickly to juvenile distress calls.|$|E
5|$|After being {{released}} from the ovary, <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> is swept into the fallopian tube by the fimbria, which is a fringe of tissue {{at the end of}} each fallopian tube. After about a day, an unfertilized egg will disintegrate or dissolve in the fallopian tube.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{mitochondrial}} {{genes are}} not inherited {{by the same}} mechanism as nuclear genes. Typically, the mitochondria are inherited from one parent only. In humans, when an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm, <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> nucleus and sperm nucleus each contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the zygote nucleus. In contrast, the mitochondria, and therefore the mitochondrial DNA, usually come from <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> only. The sperm's mitochondria enter <b>the</b> <b>egg,</b> but do not contribute genetic information to the embryo. Instead, paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo. <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> cell contains relatively few mitochondria, but it is these mitochondria that survive and divide to populate {{the cells of the}} adult organism. Mitochondria are, therefore, in most cases inherited only from mothers, a pattern known as maternal inheritance. This mode is seen in most organisms, including the majority of animals. However, mitochondria in some species can sometimes be inherited paternally. This is the norm among certain coniferous plants, although not in pine trees and yews. For Mytilids, paternal inheritance only occurs within males of the species. It has been suggested that it occurs at a very low level in humans. There is a recent suggestion that mitochondria that shorten male lifespan stay in the system because they are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival as such mitochondria {{are less likely to be}} passed on to the next generation. Therefore, it is suggested that human females and female animals tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.|$|E
50|$|As with seahorses, {{the male}} leafy seadragon cares for <b>the</b> <b>eggs.</b> <b>The</b> female {{produces}} up to 250 bright pink eggs, then deposits {{them onto the}} male's tail with her ovipositor, a long tube. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> then attach themselves to a brood patch, which supplies them with oxygen. After 9 weeks, <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> begin to hatch, depending on water conditions. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> turn a ripe purple or orange over this period, after which the male pumps his tail until the young emerge, a process which takes place over 24-48 hours. The male aids in <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> hatching by shaking his tail, and rubbing it against seaweed and rocks. Once born, the young seadragon is completely independent, eating small zooplankton until large enough to hunt mysids. Only about 5% of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> survive.|$|R

40|$|In our {{previous}} {{report by the}} collaboration with YAJIMA and others (1959), it was described that the stool examinations by means of flotation technique alone for the subjects of 10 communities in the destrict of Chiba Prefecture in Japan has leaded the discovery of an unknown kind of eggs which resembled strictly <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> of human parasitic nematodes, especially those of Hook-worms or Trichostrongylus orientalis, and which were detected in as high as several {{percent of all the}} subjects examined. From the aspect that the morphological characteristics of <b>the</b> so-called unknown <b>eggs</b> resemble <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> of phytoparasitic Meloidogyne spp., the present paper dealed with isolation of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> of Meloidogyne hapla from pea-nut roots, which were easily available, together with morphological observations of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> as well as measurement of the size theirof. These observations were followed by examinations on the resistance of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> towards <b>the</b> treatment with either experimental heat or artificial gastric juice, as well as by observations on the morphological changes of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> and <b>the</b> occurence theirof in stools following oral administration of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> in cats. <b>The</b> results indicated that, in case that <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> of Meloidogyne spp. were ingested with diets and other materials into the human body, it is probably possible that <b>the</b> ingested <b>eggs</b> may be excreted into the stools without being distructed nor digested. The differentiation is very much difficult between <b>the</b> metamorphological <b>eggs</b> of Meloidogyne hapla, obtained by the experimental administration of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> into cats, and <b>the</b> so-called unknown <b>eggs</b> of nematodes in human stools, therefore, it might be suggested that both kinds of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> are same each other...|$|R

5|$|Great spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings {{sometimes}} lasting twenty years. Nests {{are made}} in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about {{two to three times}} during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk takes up 65% of <b>the</b> <b>egg.</b> In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% of <b>the</b> <b>egg.</b> This makes the kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body. Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size of <b>the</b> <b>egg,</b> gestation is uncomfortable for the female, and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water when they come out of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles. The egg-laying season is between August and January.|$|E
