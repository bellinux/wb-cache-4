40|$|AIMS: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of a bacteriology service in respect of the time interval between collection of specimen and receipt of final report using the number and type of incoming <b>telephone</b> <b>enquiries</b> as a proxy measure. METHODS: For three months, all incoming <b>telephone</b> <b>enquiries</b> regarding the results of bacteriology specimens were monitored. Specimen type, date of sampling, the sender's location {{and the reason for}} making the <b>telephone</b> <b>enquiry</b> were recorded. RESULTS: The number of <b>telephone</b> <b>enquiries</b> made during the study was 1170, about 5 % {{of the total number of}} samples received. Most enquiries related to results of urine cultures. These accounted for 33. 9 % of the calls, but only 5 % of the total number of urines cultured. Enquiries relating to blood cultures were the next largest group accounting for 14. 9 % of calls, but 11 % of the blood cultures received resulted in a <b>telephone</b> <b>enquiry.</b> The most frequent reason for making the telephone call was that the sender had not received the final report. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians may have unrealistic expectations of the time taken to examine a specimen. A requirement for reporting sterile blood cultures after a shorter incubation period was found, and the value to patient management of earlier reporting of negative urine samples was identified...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{describe}} the patterns and clinical features of toxicity related to recreational use of mephedrone and other cathinones in the UK using {{data collected by}} the National Poisons Information Service (NPIS).

Results Over the year of study there were 2901 TOXBASE accesses and 188 <b>telephone</b> <b>enquiries</b> relating to cathinones, the majority relating to mephedrone (TOXBASE 1664, telephone 157), with a month-on-month increase in numbers.

40|$|Objective. To characterise the {{patterns}} of presentation, clinical effects and possible harms of acute toxicity following recreational use of alpha methyltryptamine (AMT) in the United Kingdom, as reported by health professionals to the National Poisons Information Service (NPIS) and to compare clinical effects with those reported after mephedrone use. Methods. NPIS <b>telephone</b> <b>enquiries</b> and TOXBASE® user sessions, the NPIS online information database, related to AMT were reviewed from March 2009 to September 2013. <b>Telephone</b> <b>enquiry</b> data were compared with those for mephedrone, the recreational substance most frequently reported to the NPIS, collected over the same period. Results. There were 63 <b>telephone</b> <b>enquiries</b> regarding AMT {{during the period of}} study, with no <b>telephone</b> <b>enquiries</b> in 2009 or 2010, 19 in 2011, 35 in 2012 and 9 in 2013 (up to September). Most patients were male (68 %) with a median age of 20 years. The route of exposure was ingestion in 55, insufflation in 4 and unknown in 4 cases. Excluding those reporting co-exposures, clinical effects recorded more frequently in AMT (n = 55) compared with those of mephedrone (n = 488) users including acute mental health disturbances (66 % vs. 32 %; Odds Ratio [OR], 4. 00; 95 % Confidence Intervals [CI], 2. 22 – 7. 19), stimulant effects (66 % vs. 40 %; OR, 2. 82; 95 % CI 1. 57 – 5. 06) and seizures (14 % vs. 2 %; OR, 9. 35; 95 % CI 3. 26 – 24. 18). Conclusions. Although still infrequent, toxicity following reported exposure to AMT has been encountered in the United Kingdom since January 2011. Stimulant features, acute mental health disturbances and seizures are more frequently reported than in those presenting following reported use of mephedrone...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To characterise the {{patterns}} of presentation and clinical features of toxicity following reported recreational use of benzofuran compounds ((2 -aminopropyl) - 2, 3 -dihydrobenzofurans) in the UK, as reported to the National Poisons Information Service (NPIS), and to compare clinical features of toxicity with those after reported mephedrone use. Methods. NPIS patient-specific <b>telephone</b> <b>enquiries</b> and user sessions for TOXBASE®, the NPIS online information database, related to (2 -aminopropyl) - 2, 3 -dihydrobenzofurans and associated synonyms were reviewed from March 2009 to August 2013. These data were {{compared with those of}} mephedrone, the recreational substance most frequently reported to NPIS, collected over the same period. Results. There were 63 <b>telephone</b> <b>enquiries</b> concerning 66 patients and 806 TOXBASE® user sessions regarding benzofuran compounds during the period of study. The first <b>telephone</b> <b>enquiry</b> was made in July 2010 and the highest numbers of enquiries were received in August 2010 (33 calls, 112 TOXBASE® sessions). Patients were predominantly male (82 %) with a median age of 29 years; 9 reported co-ingestion of other substances. Comparing the 57 patients who reported ingesting benzofuran compounds alone with 315 patients ingesting mephedrone alone, benzofurans were more often associated with stimulant features, including tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis, palpitation, fever, increased sweating, and tremor, (72 % vs. 38 %, odds ratio [OR] 4. 2, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 2. 27 – 7. 85, P < 0. 0001) and mental health disturbances (58 % vs. 38 %, OR 2. 3, 95 % CI 1. 29 – 4. 07, P = 0. 006). Other features reported after benzofuran compound ingestion included gastrointestinal symptoms (16 %), reduced level of consciousness (9 %), chest pain (7 %), and creatinine kinase elevation (5 %). Conclusions. Reported ingestion of benzofuran compounds is associated with similar toxic effects to those of amphetamines and cathinones. Mental health disturbances and stimulant features were reported more frequently following reported ingestion of benzofuran compounds than after ingestion of mephedrone...|$|R
