60|$|Shortly {{after passing}} {{the first spring}} we came in sight of a famous tree, which the Indians reverence as the altar of Walleechu. It is {{situated}} on a high part of the plain; and hence is a landmark visible at a great distance. As soon as a tribe of Indians come in sight of it, they offer their adorations by loud shouts. The tree itself is low, much branched, and thorny: just above the root it has a diameter of about three feet. It stands by itself without any neighbour, and was indeed the first tree we saw; afterwards we met with a few others of the same kind, but they were far from common. Being winter the tree had no leaves, but in their place numberless threads, by which the various offerings, such as cigars, bread, meat, pieces of cloth, etc., had been suspended. Poor Indians, not having anything better, only pull a <b>thread</b> <b>out</b> of their ponchos, and fasten it to the tree. Richer Indians are accustomed to pour spirits and mate into a certain hole, and likewise to smoke upwards, thinking thus to afford all possible gratification to Walleechu. To complete the scene, the tree was surrounded by the bleached bones of horses which had been slaughtered as sacrifices. All Indians of every age and sex make their offerings; they then think that their horses will not tire, and that they themselves shall be prosperous. The Gaucho who told me this, {{said that in the}} time of peace he had witnessed this scene, and that he and others used to wait till the Indians had passed by, for the sake of stealing from Walleechu the offerings.|$|E

40|$|This {{dynamical}} {{interpretation of}} the continuum {{is based on a}} threefold perspective. First, detailed differentiation of all standard realms of Leibnizian Weltanschauung – (R real), (P phenomenal), (I ideal). Second, analysis of the scope of the Law of Continuity famously formulated by Leibniz and mapping it onto this (RPI) structure. Third, finding the precise place of dynamics and force in this (RPI) continuum. These perspectives (taxonomical, legislative and junctional) if put together lead to a new understanding of monads ’ role; and they are not taken anymore as a discreet part of Leibnizian philosophy (as opposed to the ideal space and time), but as dynamical continuum incorporating in itself both contiguity and continuity. And in such a way they are both neutralizing and preserving the syncategorematic phenomenal infinity. The main point is that force can be applied both to perception and appetition of monads and by this we give the shortest Leibnizian answer to the Zeno’s Dichotomy paradox – “force”. But what is more important, such dynamical interpretation gives good schematic and systematic view of Leibnizian mature philosophy. And it appears (as expected) that the <b>thread</b> <b>out</b> of the Labyrinth of the Continuum is not only geometrical and physical, but metaphysical too...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a new focal ischemia model consisting of unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion with a silicone rubber cylinder {{attached to a}} nylon surgical thread inserted through the internal carotid artery in rats. Recirculation was accomplished by pulling the <b>thread</b> <b>out</b> of the artery. We evaluated the reliability of this model and studied the influence of reperfusion of the brain by measuring regional cerebral blood flow in 30 rats and by using conventional neuropathologic methods after different periods of occlusion in 48 rats. The anterior neocortex and the lateral part of the caudate putamen, which were supplied by the occluded middle cerebral artery, were the regions most frequently damaged. After 1 hour of occlusion in five rats, in the cortex supplied by the occluded artery mean±SD blood flow was 0. 19 ± 0. 08 ml/g/min (approximately 15 % {{of that in the}} corresponding region of five sham-operated control rats), and mild scattered ischemic cell change was observed. Three (n= 5) or six («= 5) hours of occlusion reduced blood flow more severely and caused severe ischemic cell changes in the cortex supplied by the occluded artery in proportion to the duration of ischemia. Characteristically, in five rats subjected to 3 hours of occlusion followed by 3 hours of recirculation, blood flow was restored and spongy edematous change was observed in the cortex supplied by the recirculated artery...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Purpose To {{investigate}} {{the usefulness of}} the “inducer grafting” technique for regeneration of the semitendinosus (ST) tendon after its harvest for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods Twenty knees of 20 patients (mean age at the time of surgery, 23. 1 [*]years) underwent ACL reconstruction with a double bundle autograft using the ST tendon (7 patients) and the ST + the gracilis (G) tendons (13 patients). “Inducer grafting” technique After harvesting the ST tendon, a passing pin with a loop thread is inserted along with the tendon stripper. The passing pin is pulled out from the medial thigh and the loop thread retained. As an inducer graft, the ST tendon branch is used. After the ACL graft has been secured, the inducer graft is sutured to the pes anserinus and the proximal end passed through by pulling the <b>thread</b> <b>out.</b> Then the inducer graft is placed within the tendon canal. The mean follow-up period was 15 [*]months. The presence and morphology of the regenerated ST tendon were examined by MRI. And the isometric hamstring strength was examined at 45 °, 90 ° and 120 ° of knee flexion. Results One month after the operation in all the patients, MRI demonstrated a low-intensity structure at the anatomical location of the ST, {{at the level of the}} superior pole of the patella and the joint line, apparently representing the regenerated ST tendon. Four months after the operation, the distal portion of the regenerated ST tendon had reached the pes anserinus in all patients. Twelve months after the operation, the regenerated ST tendon was hypertrophic in 19 of the 20 patients (95 %). The isometric knee flexion torque of the ACL-reconstructed limb was significantly lower at 90 ° and 120 ° compared with the contralateral limb. Conclusion These results suggest that the “inducer grafting” technique is able to improve the regeneration rate of the harvested ST tendon and promote hypertrophy of the regenerated ST tendon, extending all the way to the pes anserinus. However, this technique couldn’t improve the deficits in knee flexion torque after ACL reconstruction. </p...|$|E

40|$|Textiles {{from around}} the world are capable of {{conveying}} sophisticated narration. But in regions where censorship, both in the form of overt government censorship as well as individual self-censorship exists, the ability of textiles to narrate becomes a crucial tool in the discussion of topics otherwise left unspoken. Textiles can offer a form of communication that, ironically, may go unnoticed precisely because of the “innocent” materials in which these messages are told. A growing “illiteracy” to alternative modes of narration such as those offered by the crafts offers an ideal foil for such sensitive conversations. As record keepers these textiles reveal that attempts to stifle free speech in fact do little to suppress public outcry. Instead, artists seek alternative materials and metaphors such as thread and cloth to record injustice and violation, particularly against the female body. In “The Prison of Colonial Space: Narratives of Resistance” the late Zimbabwean fiction author Yvonne Vera discusses the role of sewing in South African political activist Ruth First’s biography, 117 Days: An Account of Confinement and Interrogation under the South African Ninety-Day Detention Law. First writes in detail of her use of a sewn calendar hidden “behind the lapel of my dressing-gown. ” During extended periods of solitary confinement designed to break First’s spirit, she sought sanity in this forbidden record keeping, which provided a may to chart time and return some sense of emotional control to a situation designed to remove all sense of hope from her future. First explains, “Here, with my needle and thread, I stitched one stroke for each day passed. I sewed seven upright strokes, then a horizontal stitch through them to mark a week. Every now and then I would examine the stitching and decide that the sewing was not neat enough and the strokes could be more deadly exact in size; I’d pull the <b>thread</b> <b>out</b> and remake the calendar from the beginning. This gave me a feeling that I was pushing time on, creating days, weeks, and even months. Sometimes I surprised myself and did not sew a stitch {{at the end of the}} day. I would wait for three days and the give myself a wonderful thrill knocking three days off the ninety. ...|$|E
