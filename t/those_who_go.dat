5|$|Many SCI {{patients}} have received misinformation {{about the effects}} of their injury on their sexual function and benefit from education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful and desired, it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings; a common complaint from <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>go</b> through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet sexuality {{is one of the most}} often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it. Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject. Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if they do want the information.|$|E

25|$|Islam has {{a concept}} {{similar to that}} of purgatory in Christianity.

25|$|In the Western world, Guan Yu is {{sometimes}} called the Taoist God of War, probably because {{he is one of}} the most well-known military generals worshipped by the Chinese people. This is a misconception of his role, as, unlike the Greco-Roman deity Mars or the Norse god Týr, Guan Yu, as a god, does not necessarily bless <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>go</b> to battle, but rather people who observe the code of brotherhood and righteousness.|$|E
25|$|A 1999 {{study showed}} that among churchgoers, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>go</b> to {{segregated}} or primarily white churches {{are more likely to}} exhibit racist behaviors or to have prejudiced ideas about African Americans. Those who attend integrated churches are about equal in racial attitudes to those who do not attend church at all, but those who attend racially segregated churches {{are more likely to be}} both covertly and overtly racist than either group. It is difficult to posit whether this intolerance is caused by attending a segregated church, or if those who hold prejudiced views are more likely to seek out a segregated church.|$|E

25|$|Aurobindo {{asserted}} that spiritual aspirants may pass through an intermediate zone where experiences of force, inspiration, illumination, light, joy, expansion, power, {{and freedom from}} normal limits are possible. These can become associated with personal aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi, and even be falsely interpreted as full spiritual realisation. One can pass through this zone, and the associated spiritual dangers, without harm by perceiving its real nature, and seeing through the misleading experiences. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>go</b> astray in it may end in a spiritual disaster, or may remain stuck there and adopt some half-truth as the whole truth, or become an instrument of lesser powers of these transitional planes. According to Aurobindo, this happens to many sadhaks and yogis.|$|E

500|$|Late {{adolescence}} and early adulthood are peak periods for {{the onset of}} schizophrenia, critical years in a young adult's social and vocational development. In 40% of men and 23% of women diagnosed with schizophrenia, the condition manifested itself {{before the age of}} 19. The onset of the disease is usually later in women than in men. To minimize the developmental disruption associated with schizophrenia, much work has recently been done to identify and treat the prodromal (pre-onset) phase of the illness, which has been detected up to 30months before the onset of symptoms. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>go</b> on to develop schizophrenia may experience transient or self-limiting psychotic symptoms and the non-specific symptoms of social withdrawal, irritability, dysphoria, and clumsiness before the onset of the disease. Children who go on to develop schizophrenia may [...] also demonstrate decreased intelligence, decreased motor development (reaching milestones such as walking slowly), isolated play preference, social anxiety, and poor school performance.|$|E

[...] The work attempts to convey feelings and sensations experienced in time, using new means of expression, including [...] "lines of force", which were intended to convey the directional tendencies of objects through space, [...] "simultaneity", which combined memories, present impressions and anticipation of future events, and [...] "emotional ambience" [...] in which the artist seeks by intuition to link sympathies between the exterior scene and interior emotion.|$|E
