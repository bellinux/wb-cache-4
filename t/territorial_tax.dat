The first change he asked for was increasing the tax rates for mining operations which the Governor felt were not paying a fair share in comparison {{to other parts of the}} territorial economy. He also proposed an exemption from taxation of 10 years for new railroads and 9 years for hydroelectric dams to encourage additional transportation and electrical generation capabilities within the territory. Other changes to mining operations were the establishment of an eight-hour day for mine workers, with railroad workers receiving a limit of 16 consecutive hours of work, and outlawing the practice of paying miners in company scrip redeemable only at the company store. Brodie also requested the pay for the governor's secretary be increased from US$125 to US$150/year.|$|E

In 2015, Roth, together with former fellow Jared Meyer, published the book, Disinherited: How America Is Betraying America's Young, arguing that millennials' plight is the result of government policies that are systematically stacked against young Americans to the benefit of older generations.

50|$|After the Decree of February 28, 1878, the Economic Agreement was renewed in 1886 {{since the}} Provincial Councils had {{promptly}} paid the Quota to the State Treasury without any problem; the Provincial Councils had kept {{many of the}} powers deriving from the earlier Fueros, and had their own means for tax collection. The Treasury Ministry did not collect the agreed taxes, but State investments in the Basque Country were very limited since the bulk of public investment {{was carried out by}} the Provincial Councils. The taxes that were initially agreed were the most important of those collected by the State Treasury, except for Customs duties: the five original taxes were the <b>Territorial</b> <b>Tax,</b> Industrial Tax, the Tax on Capital Transfer (Impuesto de Derechos Reales), Stamp Tax and Consumption Tax. Starting from these five original taxes, the number of taxes subjected to the agreement was extended in successive renewals, with the result that the sum to be paid to the State (the Quota) increased.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the Dolly Varden (still {{including}} bull trout, and often confused with Arctic char) {{suffered from a}} reputation as an undesirable predator of fish such as salmon, steelhead and cutthroat trout. Despite co-evolving with these other species for thousands of years, Dolly Varden were accused of indiscriminately feeding on eggs and fry of other species to their detriment. [...] Between 1921 and 1941, the Territory of Alaska, supported by the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, had an official extermination program that paid bounties on Dolly Varden. In the Iliamna Lake/Kvichak River region in southwest Alaska, the bounty was 2.5 cents per Dolly Varden tail turned into the <b>territorial</b> <b>tax</b> collector. Locals would trap Dolly Varden in nets and weirs, string 40 tails on a hoop of bailing wire and smoke them over a wood fire. One hoop would be worth one dollar. The fish carcasses {{would be used for}} dog food. The hoops of fishtails were then used as currency to pay for supplies, or in some reports, airfare with local bush pilots.|$|E
50|$|<b>Territorial</b> systems usually <b>tax</b> local income {{regardless}} of the residence of the taxpayer.

50|$|In other matters, the <b>territorial</b> bullion <b>tax</b> was repealed. Before session {{all members}} of the {{legislature}} who had expressed an opinion had opposed its repeal. Despite this the legislation made it through both houses without trouble. Finally, the session authorized a US$500 prize for the person who could produce, in 1883, the largest cotton yield on a 5 acre parcel with a stipulation that a minimum yield of 200 lb per acre was required for the prize. The prize was claimed by Felix G. Hardwick of Tempe who had produced 3390 lb of cotton on his 5-acre plot.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the 5% GST levied on most purchases, some Canadians also pay a provincial sales tax {{at a rate that}} varies by province from 0-10%. There are some purchases which are PST exempt, such as children's clothing. In the U.S., most states impose a sales tax, and cities and counties are often permitted to levy taxes as well, which can exceed 10% on purchases but realistically average at about 6-8%. Five U.S. states do not have any sales tax imposed. The Canadian province of Alberta and all three territories have no provincial or <b>territorial</b> sales <b>tax</b> on top of the GST.|$|R
5000|$|The land {{property}} tax, called [...] "territorial tax" [...] or [...] "contribution", is an annual amount paid quarterly by the property's owner. It is determined {{as a percentage}} of the property's [...] "fiscal value", which is calculated by the Internal Revenue Service, based on the property's land and built area, construction materials, age and use. The fiscal value, which is usually much lower than the market value, may be disputed by the owner. The annual levy varies between 1 and 2% of this value, depending on the property's use (residential, agricultural or commercial). Residential properties valued below US$40K (as of 2013) are not taxed; those above that threshold are taxed only on the amount exceeding US$40K. Revenues go to the municipality administering the property's commune. All municipalities contribute a share of the revenue to a [...] "common municipal fund" [...] that is then redistributed back to municipalities according to a their needs (commune's poverty rate, etc.). Additionally, municipalities charge a quarterly trash collection tax, which is often paid together with the <b>territorial</b> <b>tax</b> (if applicable).|$|E

50|$|Following the {{resignation}} of Oakes Murphy as Governor of Arizona Territory, Brodie was nominated for the position and sworn into office on July 1, 1902. His first several months were spent appointing new officials and organizing his administration. An action of note prior to the convening of the 22nd Arizona Territorial Legislature was the pardon of Pearl Hart on moral grounds. At the time, the outlaw was the only female at the Yuma Territorial Prison and her presence was causing disruptions as guards and other prisoners vied for her attentions. The December 1902 pardon was made {{on the condition that}} Hart leave the territory, a condition she quickly fulfilled. Another display of the new Governor's ethical stance was his refusal to use a US$750 discretionary fund which was available for his personal use. Brodie considered the legislative appropriation which created the fund illegal as it had no oversight provisions to prevent misuse.With the start of the 22nd Legislature in January 1903, Brodie requested several changes to the <b>territorial</b> <b>tax</b> code. The first change he asked for was increasing the tax rates for mining operations which the Governor felt were not paying a fair share in comparison {{to other parts of the}} territorial economy.

Other changes to mining operations were the establishment of an eight-hour day for mine workers, with railroad workers receiving a limit of 16 consecutive hours of work, and outlawing the practice of paying miners in company scrip redeemable only at the company store. Brodie also requested the pay for the governor's secretary be increased from US$125 to US$150/year.Other legislation coming from the session were laws requiring the licensing of dentists and physicians, requiring schools to fly the United States flag during hours the school was in session, expanding the facilities of the territorial insane asylum, and authorizing school districts with 1,000 or more residents to hire music and art instructors. Brodie also took unpopular stances on two of the session's bills. The first stance was opposition to a bill granting women the right to vote. Brodie, who personally supported women's suffrage, opposed this bill on the basis that it was not permitted under the limitations of the Arizona Organic Act. The second unpopular stance was endorsing a bill supporting joint statehood with New Mexico.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} current and highly debated issues facing the Obama Administration is: - the {{restructuring}} of the present corporate income tax system. More specifically, congress and the president’s administration are pressed with a {{decision as to whether}} to consider plans to reform the deferral of overseas income earned by US multinational corporations and ultimately move the US from a worldwide system of international taxation towards a <b>territorial</b> <b>tax</b> system. This paper highlights a current problem upon which the US taxes multinational corporations. Many in favor of a <b>territorial</b> <b>tax</b> argue that it is a much needed change to a system that has not seen significant amendment since the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and that the US adheres to a system designed when its own economy dominated the world. Additionally, supporters claim that a shake up to international tax system is necessary if US multinational companies are to compete in a global environment. They assert that if no drastic changes are made, US companies will suffer a competitive disadvantage. In assessing whether this new <b>territorial</b> <b>tax</b> system is plausible this paper will highlight four main issues that face US multinational corporations, those being (1) Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFC) rules, (2) foreign tax credits (3) Transfer pricing and Accounting Principles Board Opinion 23 – Accounting for Income Taxes – Special Areas (APB 23). Moreover, this paper encompasses {{the pros and cons of}} this new <b>territorial</b> <b>tax</b> system proposal.

40|$|The current United States {{tax code}} {{regarding}} foreign sourced income is outdated for a heavily globalized and interconnected world. Multinationals have played certain {{games with the}} tax code to lower their domestic and foreign tax bill. This form of tax avoidance has real economic effects that are leading to non-optimal economic outcomes. This paper will begin by offering examples of how multinationals are avoiding taxes, especially in the pricing of intangible assets. Other countries have adopted different ways to tax foreign profits; notably most countries either have a worldwide non-deferral tax system or a <b>territorial</b> <b>tax</b> system. There are costs and benefits associated with both systems of taxation that must be considered before adoption.

The current U. S. tax system is inefficient and overly complex. This paper will show that the U. S. tax system has major shortcomings, and will explore the popular proposals for reform.
