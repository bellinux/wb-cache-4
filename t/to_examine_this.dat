25|$|The blast {{fragments}} included {{parts of}} a radio cassette player and {{a small piece of}} circuit board. This rang alarm bells within the intelligence communities in Britain, the U.S., and West Germany, as the West German police had recovered a Semtex bomb hidden inside a Toshiba radio cassette player in an apartment in Neuss, West Germany, in October 1988, two months before PA 103 exploded. The bomb, one of five, had been in the possession of members of the Damascus–based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC), led by Ahmed Jibril, a former Syrian army captain. Feraday travelled to West Germany <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>this</b> bomb, and though he found that the Lockerbie fragments did not precisely match the Toshiba model, they were similar enough for him to contact Toshiba. With the company's help, DERA discovered there were seven models in which the printed circuit board bore exactly the same details as the Lockerbie fragments.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, the {{specification}} {{was aimed}} at providing a capable defence interceptor that could form part of the nation's measures to counter this threat {{would need to be}} capable of similar speeds and an exceptionally high rate of climb in order to reach high altitude bombers in time. Conceptually, the envisioned aircraft was to be operated in a similar fashion to that of the German Me 163, it would use its rocket engine to climb rapidly to meet and engage its target prior to gliding back to earth in a fuel-exhausted state before landing upon a retractable skid arrangement. According to aviation author Derek Wood, Saunders-Roe had quickly identified that that the unpowered 'glide home' return flight could be a source of danger and expense, and thus approached the Air Ministry to discuss their concept for the adoption of a secondary jet engine, which would be used for the purposes of powering the interceptor's journey home. The Ministry was enthusiastic on this concept; in May 1951, all interested companies were asked <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>this</b> arrangement.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Douglas also {{referenced}} Aldridge {{and concluded}} that the goal of voir dire was to disclose “prejudices of a serious character”. He then associated hair growth with prejudice of a serious character. [...] He points out that “hair growth is symbolic to many of rebellion against traditional society and disapproval of the way the current power structure handles social problems,” and he further acknowledged that for some “people, nonconventional hair growth symbolizes an undesirable lifestyle characterized by unreliability, dishonesty, lack of moral values, communal (communist) tendencies, and the assumption of drug use.” [...] Douglas concluded that denying a petitioner the right <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>this</b> aspect of prejudice was to also deny him an effective means of voir dire.|$|E

2500|$|Previous {{studies have}} theorized that CSE is an {{underlying}} (i.e., latent) trait {{that explains the}} relationship between locus of control, neuroticism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. [...] However, {{it has also been}} suggested that core self-evaluations can be conceptualized as an [...] "aggregate construct," [...] which is composed of or predicted by its four dimensions. In other words, an individual's levels on each of these traits may predict their level of core self-evaluations as opposed to the other way around. This conceptualization difference has important implications for how CSE is measured and, thus, has important implications for the effects found when researching this construct. For this reason, additional research is necessary <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>this</b> conceptualization discrepancy.|$|E
2500|$|Pabst is also {{identified}} with another genre which branched from the New Objectivity - that {{of social and}} political films. These filmmakers dared to confront sensitive and controversial social issues which engaged the public in those days; such as anti-Semitism, prostitution and homosexuality. To a large extent, Weimar cinema was playing a vibrant and important role by leading public debate on those issues. Pabst, in his film Diary of a Lost Girl (1929), {{tells the story of a}} young woman who has a child out of wedlock, is thrown out into the street by her family and has to resort to prostitution in order to survive. As early as 1919, Richard Oswald’s film Different from the Others portrayed a man torn between his homosexual tendencies and the moral and social conventions. It is considered to be the first German film to deal with homosexuality and some researchers even believe it to be the first in the world <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>this</b> issue explicitly. That same year, the film Ritual Murder (1919) by Jewish film producer Max Nivelli came to the screen. This film was the first to make the German public aware of the consequences of anti-Semitism and xenophobia. It portrayed a “pogrom” which is carried out against the Jewish inhabitants of a village in Tsarist Russia. In the background, a love story also evolves between a young Russian student and the daughter of the leader of the Jewish community, something that was considered a taboo at the time. Later on, in an attempt to reflect the rapidly growing anti-Semitic atmosphere, Oswald confronted the same issue with his film Dreyfus (1930), which portrayed the 1894 political scandal of the [...] "Dreyfus Affair", which until today remains one of the most striking examples of miscarriage of justice and blatant anti-Semitism.|$|E
