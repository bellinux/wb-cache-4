The Correlation between <b>the</b> <b>Ability</b> <b>of</b> Reading Comprehension, Language Attitude and <b>the</b> <b>Ability</b> <b>of</b> Short Story Appreciation at Elementary School Students In Gugus Yudistira, Selogiri Wonogiri. Thesis: Surakarta: Indonesian Education Study Program, Post Graduate Program, Sebelas Maret University. June 2009. This {{research}} {{aimed to}} determine the correlation between (1) <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation, (2) language attitude and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation, and (3) both <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension and language attitude together and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation. The research was carried out at elementary schools in Gugus Yudistira Selogiri Wonogiri, from January to June 2009. The research method used was descriptive of correlational. The population of the research were the elementary school students in Gugus Yudistira Selogiri Wonogiri. The sample consisted of 120 students who were taken by using simple random sampling. The instruments used for data collection were: test for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension, test for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation; and questionary for language attitude. The technique used for analyzing the data was the statistical technique of regression and correlation. The result of the study shows that: (1) {{there is a positive}} correlation between <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation (r y 1 =. 87 at the level of significance α =. 05 with N = 120 where rt =. 18); (2) there is a positive correlation between language attitude and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation (r y 2 =. 78 at the level of significance α =. 05 with N = 120 where rt =. 18; (3) there is a positive correlation between both <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension and language attitude together and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation (R y. 12 =. 86 at the level of significance α =. 05 with N = 120 where rt =. 18). The above results show that both <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension and language attitude simultaneously give significant contribution to <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation. It means that both variables could be good predictors for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation. The analysis also indicates that the correlation between <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation is stronger than that language attitude and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation. It means that <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension be considered a better predictor for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation than language attitude. Consequently, the teacher should pay more attention to <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension than the other aspect [...] - language attitude [...] - in improving short story appreciation class...|$|R

5|$|Among {{the main}} reasons that experts cite for causing {{negative}} effects from yoga are beginners' competitiveness and instructors' lack of qualification. As the demand for yoga classes grows, many people get certified to become yoga instructors, often with relatively little training. Not every newly certified instructor can evaluate the condition of every new trainee in their class and recommend refraining from doing certain poses or using appropriate props to avoid injuries. In turn, a beginning yoga student can overestimate <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> their body and strive to do advanced poses before their body is flexible or strong enough to perform them.|$|E

This decline of the overall population in the last 30 years has resulted in the classification of the species as globally Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

After the examination, Grove was classified as 4-F, making him ineligible for military service, which meant that he could continue his baseball career.|$|E

Pope Urban was concerned with increasing restlessness of the martial nobility in Western Europe, who, currently deprived of major enemies, were causing chaos throughout the countryside.

40|$|International audienceThe {{interferon}} alpha (IFN-α) -inducible restriction factor MxB blocks HIV- 1 infection after {{reverse transcription}} but prior to integration. Fate-of-capsid experiments have correlated <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to block HIV- 1 infection with stabilization of viral cores during infection. We previously demonstrated that HIV- 1 restriction by MxB requires capsid binding and oligomerization. Deletion and gain-of-function experiments have mapped the HIV- 1 restriction <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to its N-terminal 25 amino acids. This report {{reveals that the}} N-terminal 25 amino acids of MxB exhibit two separate functions: (i) <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to bind to HIV- 1 capsid and (ii) the nuclear localization signal of MxB, which is important for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to shuttle into the nucleus. To understand whether MxB restriction of HIV- 1 requires capsid binding and/or nuclear localization, we genetically separated these two functions and evaluated their contributions to restriction. Our experiments demonstrated that the (11) RRR(13) motif is important for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to bind capsid and to restrict HIV- 1 infection. These experiments suggested that capsid binding is necessary for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to block HIV- 1 infection. Separately from the capsid binding function of MxB, we found that residues (20) KY(21) regulate <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> N-terminal 25 amino acids of MxB {{to function as a}} nuclear localization signal; however, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> N-terminal 25 amino acids to function as a nuclear localization signal was not required for restriction. IMPORTANCE MxB/Mx 2 blocks HIV- 1 infection in cells from the immune system. MxB blocks infection by preventing the uncoating process <b>of</b> HIV- 1. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to block HIV- 1 infection requires that MxB binds to the HIV- 1 core by using its N-terminal domain. The present study shows that MxB uses residues (11) RRR(13) to bind to the HIV- 1 core during infection and that these residues are required for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to block HIV- 1 infection. We also found that residues (20) KY(21) constitute a nuclear localization signal that is not required for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to block HIV- 1 infection...|$|R
