5|$|Rodney K. Waldron {{served as}} the head of the library from 1954 until 1984. In the same year as Waldron's departure, Melvin R. George took over as {{director}} of the library, which at that time had a $4.5 million annual budget and 72 employees. In 1986, a room was added to <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>to</b> accommodate a donation from alumnus Linus Pauling, which consisted of his papers and two Nobel Prizes.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1932, Mary J. L. McDonald {{made the}} then-largest {{donation}} of books {{to the library}} when she donated volumes worth just over $10,000. She donated a total of over 1,000 items that included a complete works of Abraham Lincoln valued at $4,800. In 1936, the Works Progress Administration gave a decorative archway to <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>to</b> be installed over the south entrance to the building. The library was among several buildings vandalized by University of Oregon students in October 1945 during {{the run-up to the}} Civil War football game between the two schools. The library received a bequest of about 5,500 volumes valued at about $15,000 in December 1947 from William H. Galvani's estate. This donation overtook that of McDonald to become the largest received by the library up to that time.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Florence <b>Library</b> {{opened in}} 1914 at the {{residence}} of Fred W. Cleland. On June 30, 1915, <b>the</b> <b>library</b> moved <b>to</b> Florence Avenue Elementary School.

5|$|By 1943, Sands {{had become}} {{impatient}} with the Navy's bureaucracy. After discussing the situation with Wilson, he appeared unannounced in Santa Fe, New Mexico, {{at the office of}} Dorothy McKibbin, who had been designated to meet newcomers to Los Alamos Laboratory. After she made a telephone call to the personnel office, which had just received a desperate call for electronics people, Sands was bussed to Los Alamos. To his surprise, he was met by Jorgenson, who had just joined the Manhattan Project after leaving Clark and going to Nebraska. He immediately took Sands to <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>to</b> read Robert Serber's Los Alamos Primer, which introduced him to the basic physical principles of nuclear fission as they were known at the time, and their implications for nuclear weapon design.|$|E
5|$|Dewey's {{obituary}} ran in over 270 {{national and}} international newspapers and his death was announced on Japanese television. A public memorial service was held in December 2006 and his cremated remains were buried outside of the library. Despite numerous offers, the library placed a two-year moratorium on getting a new cat. In January 2009, the library board voted to have a permanent prohibition against any other cats or pets at <b>the</b> <b>library,</b> <b>to</b> avoid problems for patrons with allergies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1937, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>to</b> feed the pigeons. While {{crossing}} a street {{a couple of blocks}} from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries were never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.|$|E

5|$|Reagan's casket, a Marsellus Masterpiece model, {{was carried}} by a {{military}} honor guard representing all branches of the United States Armed Forces into the lobby of <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>to</b> lie in repose. There, a brief family service was conducted by the Reverend Dr. Michael H. Wenning, former pastor of Bel Air Church, where Reagan worshipped. When the prayer service concluded, Nancy Reagan and her family approached the casket, where Nancy laid her head on it. After the family left, {{the doors of the}} presidential library opened, and the public began filing in at a rate of 2,000 an hour throughout the night. In all, about 108,000 people visited the presidential library to see the casket.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} bought by Colonel Joseph Holden Strutt a British soldier and long-standing Member of Parliament. He renovated the house and {{neighbouring}} church. He extended the house {{before his death in}} 1845. His youngest daughter Charlotte Olivia inherited the house and lived there with her husband the Reverend Robert Drummond until her death in 1897. In 1912 it was inherited by Richard Strutt, the youngest son of the second Baron Rayleigh. Richard Strutt added an orangery and built <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>to</b> designs by Charles Bateman. In addition he joined the ruined chapel near the gate {{to the rest of the}} house. The house was then inherited by his son John Strutt.|$|E
5|$|The {{main entry}} {{gate to the}} tomb is two-storied and its façade has very {{elaborate}} ornamentation over plastered surfaces and is in ornate purple colour. There is an inscription in Arabic {{on the surface and}} its translation reads “When the hero of plain bravery departs from the transitory, may he become a resident of god’s paradise”. The rear side of the façade, which is seen after entering through the gate, has many rooms and <b>the</b> <b>library.</b> <b>To</b> the right of the gate is the mosque which is a three-domed structure marked with stripes.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>library</b> {{was used}} <b>to</b> be {{located at the}} {{opposite}} of the canteen but due to funding cuts from <b>the</b> Government, <b>the</b> <b>library</b> had <b>to</b> be located to the 4th floor of Block H.|$|R

50|$|Also {{the county}} {{operates}} <b>the</b> Anthony Quinn <b>Library</b> in <b>the</b> CDP. <b>The</b> <b>library,</b> originally known as <b>the</b> Belvedere <b>Library,</b> opened in January 1914. In 1925 <b>the</b> <b>library</b> moved <b>to</b> a storefront facility; {{at that time}} its collection was several thousand books. In 1937 <b>the</b> <b>library</b> moved <b>to</b> a new site. In 1973 <b>the</b> <b>library</b> moved <b>to</b> its current location. On January 5, 1982, <b>the</b> <b>library</b> took its current name; the childhood house of actor Anthony Quinn was located on the present day site of <b>the</b> <b>library,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>library</b> was renamed after Quinn. The First Supervisorial District funded a renovation that occurred in 2000. <b>The</b> <b>library</b> reopened in February 2001 with a new appearance and new furnishings.|$|R
5|$|Another {{design was}} {{requested}} of Brine, {{but this time}} for a smaller and less expensive building. In 1818, the Keys purchased the building {{in which they had}} formerly met, moving <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>to</b> the Grammar School. The new plans were agreed upon by all concerned, but there continued to be disagreements between the British Treasury department and the Keys over how to fund the project. The Treasury believed that the cost should be covered by Manx taxes, but the Keys argued that this tax would be excessive. The two parties eventually each agreed to pay some of the £1039-10-0d cost, and the project was approved on 31 May 1819, just under 30 years after the first discussions. The building was completed in less than two years, and the Keys started using the building in January 1821.|$|E
5|$|By then, Morgan {{was drawn}} into another situation. There was deep {{concern that the}} Trust Company of America and the Lincoln Trust might fail to open on Monday due to {{continuing}} runs by depositors. On Saturday evening 40–50 bankers had gathered at <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>to</b> discuss the crisis, with the clearing-house bank presidents in the East room and the trust company executives in the West room. Morgan and those dealing with the Moore & Schley situation {{had moved to the}} librarian’s office. There Morgan told his counselors that he would agree to help shore up Moore & Schley only if the trust companies would work together to bail out their weakest brethren. The discussion among the bankers continued late into Saturday night but without much progress. Around midnight, J.P. Morgan informed a leader of the trust company presidents that keeping Moore & Schley afloat would require $25 million, and he would not commit those funds unless the problems with the trust companies could also be resolved. The trust company executives understood they would not receive further help from Morgan; they would have to finance any bailout of the two struggling trust companies.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the YWCA of Salem was {{organized}} by the same Salem Women's Club. Located in downtown on Cottage Street Northeast, the YWCA moved in 1954 to the lot adjoining the library. By the 1960s, the small library had a collection in excess of 100,000 volumes, but needed a larger facility. A public campaign {{to build a new}} library began in 1968, with <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>to</b> be part of a larger government center that included a city hall and fire station. In 1971, the YWCA purchased the adjacent Carnegie library building for $150,000, and on July 6, 1972, the Salem Public Library vacated the Carnegie building and moved to Salem’s new Civic Center located west of the old library. Located next to the YWCA's existing home, the old library was turned into the organization's youth center. The building was remodeled from 1990 to 1991.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Bexley <b>Library</b> {{was founded}} in 1924 in the Bexley High School. The first {{director}} of <b>the</b> <b>library</b> after <b>the</b> <b>library</b> transitioned <b>to</b> its own location was Sarah Bilby in 1934. Throughout the 20th century <b>the</b> <b>library</b> continued <b>to</b> grow, with additions {{to the side and}} back of the building. Since 2009 <b>the</b> <b>library</b> has added a homework help center for children and teens, free wireless internet for patrons, and a computer center for patrons. <b>The</b> <b>library</b> has joined <b>the</b> Central <b>Library</b> Consortium <b>to</b> partner with 13 other local libraries and now offers patrons access to over 4.7 million resources.|$|R

50|$|During {{the second}} Sino-Japanese War, <b>the</b> <b>library</b> moved <b>to</b> Leshan, Sichuan. During {{the bombing in}} Leshan on August 19, 1939 and the plundering of books by the Japanese in Hankou {{occurred}} on March 4, 1940, many volumes were lost, <b>the</b> <b>library</b> collection dropped <b>to</b> less than 100,000 volumes. It then served as an institution to preserve books, and did not allow people to borrow them. When <b>the</b> <b>library</b> returned <b>to</b> Luojia Hill after the war, the collection grew to 154,455 volumes.|$|R
5|$|Ryouta, {{searching for}} a way into the medical center basement, seeks out Nageki in <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>to</b> ask him about his death. Upon {{discovering}} documents revealing that Operation Hatoful was a Hawk Party project into developing biological weapons for use against humans using the school as an experimental facility—with a focus on a strain of H5N1 almost immediately lethal to humans dubbed the Charon virus—Nageki recalls that the fire was caused by his committing suicide by self-immolation after months of forced experimentation in order to destroy and remove any trace of the virus, which was isolated in his body, and that researchers often went in through the chemistry preparation room. Ryouta, Kazuaki, and Anghel {{make their way into}} the medical center's basement through the chemistry lab and encounter Labor 9, electrocuting it using a stun gun given to Ryouta earlier by Mister One. They confront Shuu, who imprisons Kazuaki and Anghel, leaving them to die of poison gas before leading Ryouta away. Meanwhile, San comforts Sakuya, {{and the two of them}} arrive to break Anghel and Kazuaki out of the prison.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} again {{served as}} a library in March 1937, when Romney's community library was relocated {{to the first floor}} of Literary Hall from its previous facility {{in the basement of the}} Hampshire County Courthouse. The library had been established on April 11, 1935 as a project by the American Legion Auxiliary, and was housed in a room of the courthouse basement where it was staffed by volunteers and open from 2pm to 4pm on Saturday afternoons. When the library's collection of both purchased and donated books outgrew its space in the courthouse basement, the Clinton Lodge Masons granted permission to <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>to</b> house its collection at Literary Hall in 1937. Following its move to Literary Hall, the library expanded its hours, and expanded them again, to five afternoons a week, through the assistance of the National Youth Administration and the Works Progress Administration.|$|E
5|$|The librarians {{sought a}} larger and more centrally-located space than the Briarcliff Farms building. On March 18, 1930, after {{invitation}} from the Briarcliff school district's Board of Education, the library was relocated again. It moved to a large room {{on the main floor}} of Briarcliff High School's extension to its Law Park school building. In August 1949, the school required more classroom space, so the Board of Education asked <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>to</b> relocate. The village board then provided the library with two rooms {{on the second floor of}} its recreation building near the village downtown on Old Route 100 (then part of NY Route 100). From the beginning, the recreation center rooms were too small to hold the library's collection (only holding about 7,000 of its 8,500 books), had insufficient room for tables and chairs, and no space for exhibits or displays. As well, the area was busy with traffic, due to its location at the intersection of two highways. It was also far from the village's public school buildings and had no sidewalks nearby, making it poorly-accessible and hazardous for children to visit.|$|E

5|$|The main {{family living}} {{quarters}} {{are located in}} the 1752 addition. The staircase hall is the only room in the 1752 house to have kept its original, Georgian interior. The rococo plaster ceiling is attributed to Shrewsbury-born architect, Thomas Farnolls Pritchard, who also designed interiors at Tatton Hall, Powis Castle and Croft Castle. Facing the gardens, {{on the north side of}} the house, is the library. Remodelled in the early 1800s, this room was previously used by the family as a dining room. It features fitted 19th-century mahogany bookcases, decorated with small acanthus friezes. The white marble fireplace is flanked on either side by family coats of arms. Connecting <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>to</b> the staircase hall and the drawing room is the ante-room, which is furnished with pieces commissioned by the family in the late 18th century. Originally, an entrance into the hall was located in this octagonal room, until Randle Wilbraham III relocated it. The room features copies of works by Raphael, attributed to Michelangelo Maestri.|$|E
5|$|The post-1785 period {{would see}} {{an era of}} {{prosperity}} of the college under Principal William Cleaver. The college began to be populated by gentlemen, its income doubling between 1790 and 1810, and academic success considerable. Efforts to reconstruct Brasenose were not completed, however, until {{the second half of}} the century with the addition of New Quad between 1886 and 1911. Brasenose's financial position remained secure, although under the tenure of Principal Edward Hartopp Cradock Brasenose's academic record waned greatly, with much of its success focussed on sports– where it excelled most notably in cricket and rowing. The mid-Century Royal Commissions were navigated– although they were opposed in form, their recommendations welcomed including the submission of accounts. The election of Charles Buller Heberden as Principal in 1889 led to a reversal in Brasenose's academic failures, although its sporting performance suffered. Heberden was the first lay Principal, presiding over an increasingly secular college, opening up <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>to</b> undergraduates, instituting an entrance exam for the first time and accepting Rhodes scholarships.|$|E
5|$|From 1918, Burnet {{attended}} the University of Melbourne, {{where he lived}} in Ormond College on a residential scholarship. There, he read more of Darwin's work and {{was influenced by the}} ideas of science and society in the writings of H. G. Wells. He enjoyed his time at university and spent much of his free time reading biology books in <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>to</b> feed his passion for scientific knowledge. He also had fleeting sporting success, holding down a position in Ormond's First VIII rowing squad for a brief period. He continued to pursue his study of beetles in private, although his classmates found out and there was no loss in this as they viewed his hobby positively. Despite an ongoing shyness, Burnet got on well with staff and students at university. Burnet was self-motivated and often skipped lectures to study at his own faster pace and pursue further knowledge in the library, and he came equal first in physics and chemistry in first year. The following year, 1918, he became increasingly immersed in laboratory work, but he was also dogged by peer pressure to enlist in the military, which he saw as a distasteful prospect. However, this was averted {{by the end of the}} war. In 1919, he was one of 12 high-performing students selected for extra tuition, and he came equal first in third year physiology. He began clinical work in the same year, but found it somewhat unpleasant as he was interested in diagnosing the patient and had little interest in showing empathy towards them.|$|E
