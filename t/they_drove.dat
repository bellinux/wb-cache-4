5|$|The 8th Panzer Division and 16th Motorised Infantry Division faced {{almost no}} {{resistance}} as <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> east towards Belgrade, capturing Našice, Osijek, Vinkovci and Vukovar during the day. On {{the night of}} 11/12 April, they captured Sremska Mitrovica, Ruma and secured a crossing over the Danube via an undamaged bridge near Bogojevo.|$|E
5|$|The {{neighboring}} Osages {{were not}} so affected, as they had access to arms smuggled by French traders from British territory in present-day Illinois. With superior weaponry, <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> between the Southern Pawnees and the Wichitas, pushing the latter group southward to the Red River. The Pawnees moved northward into Nebraska, possibly because of news that modern weapons were available from traders on the Platte.|$|E
5|$|The poem is a {{detailed}} description of several objects, including a photo album and the camera that took the pictures in it, and is essentially about the nostalgia that the speaker, presumably Gibson himself, feels towards the details of his family's history: the painstaking descriptions of the houses they lived in, the cars <b>they</b> <b>drove,</b> and even their pets.|$|E
50|$|An epic drove was {{performed}} by the Tibbett brothers in the 1890s when <b>they</b> <b>droved</b> a flock of 30,000 ewes from Wellshot to Roma, a distance of over 700 km, in search of grass for the stock. The sheep were all shorn in Roma and lambing started as relieving rains came to Wellshot. The flock was brought back with an additional 3,000 lambs.|$|R
50|$|The team only played {{four games}} this season and won half. <b>They</b> only <b>drove</b> in 77 runs for the four games.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll have to {{take him}} around to a {{blacksmith}} shop," [...] said Andy, and <b>they</b> accordingly <b>drove</b> on until such a place was reached.|$|R
5|$|Whitlam {{returned}} to the Prime Minister's residence, The Lodge, where he had lunch. As his aides arrived, he informed them of his sacking. Whitlam drafted a resolution for the House, expressing confidence in his Government. No ALP Senate leaders were at The Lodge, nor did Whitlam and his party contact any when <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> back to Parliament House, confining their strategy to the House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|Around 1821, the Zulu general Mzilikazi of the Khumalo clan {{successfully}} {{rebelled against}} King Shaka and created his own clan, the Ndebele. The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the Transvaal, {{leaving a trail}} of destruction in their wake and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the Mfecane. When Dutch trekboers converged on the Transvaal in 1836, <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> the tribe even further northward. By 1838, the Rozwi Empire, along with the other smaller Shona states were conquered by the Ndebele and reduced to vassaldom.|$|E
5|$|In mid-March recent successes by U-boats {{caused the}} Admiralty to {{transfer}} destroyers from the Home Fleet to escort duties in the North Atlantic. Fury {{was one of}} these and was assigned to the 4th Escort Group. In April the group escorted Convoys HX 231, HX 234 and ONS 5 (where <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> off attacking U-boat wolfpacks). In May she escorted ON 184 before beginning a brief refit on the Humber.|$|E
50|$|Sandy {{drove his}} 2004 Mazda to the location, and met Fox first, near Emmons Avenue. <b>They</b> then <b>drove</b> to Howard Beach, where Fortunato, Shurov, and Timmons were waiting.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was indeed, sir. At {{one time}} <b>they</b> fairly <b>drove</b> us back, but I {{think that we}} should have beaten them even if you had not brought help to us." ...|$|R
5000|$|Late 1830s Europeans first {{settled the}} area, {{and used the}} fertile river valley as stock runs. <b>They</b> often <b>drove</b> stock around the brim of the bank, thus the park's name, Brimbank.|$|R
5|$|In the 3rd quarter, New York's defense made a {{goal line}} stand, {{which became a}} turning point in the game. New York, who had trouble {{mounting}} drives to that point, then had a 95-yard drive which culminated in a touchdown, making the score 14–10. <b>They</b> <b>drove</b> again in the 4th quarter, with quarterback Charlie Conerly throwing a 15-yard touchdown pass to Frank Gifford to take the lead, 17–14.|$|E
5|$|Ohio State {{was unable}} to score and gave the ball back to Texas with 13:24 left in the game. Texas was forced to punt. On the Buckeyes' next {{possession}} <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> from their own 30 to the Texas 33 before settling for a sixth field goal attempt by Huston, this one from 50yards out. Huston missed wide left to leave Ohio State still ahead by sixpoints. Texas took over at their own 33with 5:07 left in the game.|$|E
5|$|The Interstate grew quickly, {{along with}} the {{automobile}} industry, allowing a new-found mobility that permeated ways of American life and culture. The automobile and the Interstate became the American symbol of individuality and freedom, and, for the first time, automobile buyers accepted that the automobile <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> indicated their social standing and level of affluence. It became a statement of their personality and an extension of their self-concepts.|$|E
25|$|Slug credits {{most of the}} group's {{success to}} {{the large amount of}} touring the group does. In the early days, <b>they</b> once <b>drove</b> from Minneapolis to Dallas to play a show for $250.|$|R
6000|$|<b>They</b> then <b>drove</b> to Cecil's house, where Mrs. Evelyn {{went in to}} let Esther {{know her}} hour of starting; but where Cecil came running down, and putting {{his head into the}} carriage, said—- ...|$|R
60|$|I {{began to}} stammer feebly that I hoped she hadn't thought--But again she stopped me, and {{her words were}} so {{unexpected}} that <b>they</b> quite <b>drove</b> Cynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind.|$|R
5|$|The {{massacre}} at Kraljevo, {{as well as}} a similar and nearly concurrent massacre in nearby Kragujevac, convinced German commanders that mass killings of Serbian hostages were not only ineffectual but also counterproductive, as <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> locals into the hands of insurgents and sometimes resulted in the deaths of factory workers contributing to the German war effort. Following the war, several senior German military officials were tried and convicted for their involvement in the reprisal shootings at the Nuremberg Trials and the Subsequent Nuremberg trials.|$|E
5|$|Tintin and I (2003), a {{documentary}} by Danish director Anders Høgsbro Østergaard based on Numa Sadoul's 1971 interview with Hergé, includes restored {{portions of the}} interview that Hergé had heavily edited and rewritten in Sadoul's book. With full access to the audio recordings, the filmmaker explored the personal issues that the author had while he was creating Tintin in Tibet and how <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> him to create what is now regarded as his most personal adventure.|$|E
5|$|At about 04:30 on June 30, 1934, Hitler and {{his entourage}} flew into Munich. From the airport <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> to the Bavarian Interior Ministry, where they {{assembled}} the leaders of an SA rampage {{that had taken place}} in city streets the night before. Enraged, Hitler tore the epaulets off the shirt of Obergruppenführer August Schneidhuber, the chief of the Munich police, for failing to keep order in the city on the previous night. Hitler shouted at Schneidhuber and accused him of treachery. Schneidhuber was executed later that day. As the stormtroopers were hustled off to prison, Hitler assembled a large group of SS and regular police, and departed for the Hanselbauer Hotel in Bad Wiessee, where Ernst Röhm and his followers were staying.|$|E
50|$|They met in Austin, Texas in 1992, when Pete Kennedy {{was playing}} in Nanci Griffith's band. For their first date, <b>they</b> each <b>drove</b> 500 miles to meet at Buddy Holly's grave in Lubbock, Texas.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> all <b>drove</b> back to Blitar with 25 {{kilograms}} of potassium chlorate and ten kilos of sulfur for bomb making, {{as well as}} a pistol and ammunition. Not long afterwards, another operative delivered 30 extra {{kilograms of}} TNT.|$|R
50|$|<b>Theys</b> also <b>drove</b> a Maserati MC 12 for Doran Racing in the ALMS in 2007, {{an effort}} that stunned the GT1 class when it beat the factory Corvettes to win the pole at the Petit Le Mans that year.|$|R
5|$|In March 2005, the {{construction}} process {{began with the}} sinking of the first caisson for the tower into the bedrock. In April, construction began on the foundation below the Chicago River. In July 2005, water from the river began seeping into the building site, through crevices in a corner where the foundation wall meets the Wabash Avenue Bridge. Divers discovered that the leak could not be sealed from the water side. After several other failed attempts to correct the problem, <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> a steel plate next to the gap and filled the space between with concrete after digging it out.|$|E
5|$|Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev was {{intended}} as the main Soviet offensive for 1943. Its aim was to destroy the 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf, and cut off the extended southern portion of Army Group South. After the heavy losses sustained by the Voronezh Front, during Operation Citadel, the Soviets needed time to regroup and refit, delaying {{the start of the}} offensive until 3 August. Diversionary attacks, launched two weeks earlier across the Donets and Mius Rivers into the Donbass, drew the attention of German reserves and thinned the defending forces that would face the main blow. The offensive was initiated by the Voronezh Front and Steppe Fronts against the northern wing of Army Group South. <b>They</b> <b>drove</b> through the German positions, making broad and deep penetrations. By 5 August, the Soviets had liberated Belgorod.|$|E
5|$|Senator Joseph S. Clark's and Senator Robert F. Kennedy's {{tour of the}} Mississippi Delta {{occurred}} on April 10, 1967. At the behest of civil rights lawyer Marian Wright, Clark and Kennedy, together with two other Senators, traveled to Mississippi to investigate reports of extreme poverty and starvation. Following a field hearing, <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> from Greenville to Clarkesdale, stopping and touring impoverished communities as they went. Deeply disturbed by what they saw, the senators returned to Washington D.C. and began pushing {{for a series of}} reforms to alleviate the situation. Extensive media coverage of the event exposed the American public to real instances of malnutrition and starvation. The country was shocked and hunger became an important topic nationwide as people began looking for solutions. Efforts by the government and political action groups ultimately resulted in the problem being largely reduced by the 1970s.|$|E
60|$|Harry (With force). Look here, <b>they</b> fairly <b>drove</b> me out. Poor mother nagged at me {{for being}} idle, {{and the old man}} said he would cut my soul out of my body rather than let me go to sea.|$|R
50|$|The Okęcie Airport fire {{crew was}} aware of the emergency; when the {{aircraft}} crashed <b>they</b> immediately <b>drove</b> towards the crash site, but they did not manage to reach it because the truck could not pass through the gaps between the trees.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, former NOW members Pat Goltz and Cathy Callaghan founded Feminists for Life, {{with the}} goal of {{eliminating}} the root causes that <b>they</b> felt <b>drove</b> women to abortion, contending that abortion violated core feminist principles of justice, non-discrimination and nonviolence.|$|R
5|$|The last {{operations}} of 1941 were in December, when the LRDG twice ferried the SAS {{to and from}} raids on Axis airfields, attacking the airfields at Sirte (twice), El Agheila, Ajdabiya, Nofaliya and Tamit, and destroying 151 aircraft and 30 vehicles. During the second raid at Sirte, the SAS devised a new method of attacking parked aircraft. <b>They</b> <b>drove</b> the LRDG trucks between the rows of aircraft, which were then engaged by machine guns and hand grenades. Prior to this the procedure had been to quietly infiltrate an airfield and place Lewes bombs on aircraft and vehicles, leaving before the bombs exploded, but this attack was so successful that it became the preferred method for attacking airfields.|$|E
5|$|The loyalist force {{marched to}} the Hippodrome, where <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> away most of John's supporters. They then entered the palace, where they found scarce {{opposition}} from John's attendants. John was captured after a short chase in the palace and his head was immediately cut off, to be displayed {{the next morning at}} the Forum of Constantine, while his body was displayed at Blachernae. A similar fate befell many of his supporters that night, while others were captured and tortured to extract the names of all the conspirators. Alexios Mourtzouphlos was likely put in prison for his role in this affair (he is known to have been in prison in 1203), and the two Komnenos brothers, Alexios and David, seem to have fled the capital immediately after the coup's failure.|$|E
5|$|With {{the design}} process complete, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle {{possessing}} 65 panels and costing $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six propane tanks. The visibility inside the vehicle was poor, so monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> {{on the streets of}} Chicago for the film's scenes.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> first <b>drove</b> as test drivers {{during a}} test session at Silverstone. Natacha Gachnang drove in the rookie {{sessions}} in the 2007-08 Czech round, on October 12, 2007; and Rahel Frey in the 2007-08 Malaysian rookie sessions, on November 23, 2007.|$|R
50|$|This time, the Spanish army prevailed, as they regained {{possession}} of the town. <b>They</b> successfully <b>drove</b> the insurgents out of the government centers. More Spanish troops arrived from Peñaranda, forcing the poorly armed rebels to retreat and leaving behind 60 of their dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{it seems}} {{while they were}} quarrelling about it, the War-Office cut the matter short by {{accepting}} his resignation, I suppose the commander-in-chief had learned his character; but the matter was warmly contested: <b>they</b> even <b>drove</b> the captain to a declaration of his principles." ...|$|R
