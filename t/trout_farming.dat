500|$|About {{three-quarters of}} U.S. {{production}} comes from Idaho, particularly the Snake River area, {{due in part}} to the quality and temperature of the water available there. California and Washington also produce significant amounts of farmed trout. [...] In the east, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and West Virginia have farming operations. Rainbow <b>trout</b> <b>farming</b> is one of the largest finfish aquaculture industries in the U.S. They are raised inland in facilities where raceways or ponds have continuously flowing water with little pollution and a low risk of escape. The U.S. industry is noted for using best management practices. Imports constitute only about 15percent of farmed rainbows sold in the U.S., and nearly all domestic production is consumed within the country; very little is exported. The U.S. produces about 7percent of the world's farmed trout. Rainbow trout, especially those raised in farms and hatcheries, are susceptible to enteric redmouth disease. A considerable amount of research has been conducted on redmouth disease, given its serious implications for rainbow <b>trout</b> <b>farming.</b> The disease does not infect humans.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we compare}} the {{economic}} performance of organic <b>trout</b> <b>farms</b> to conventional <b>trout</b> and organic agricultural farms. Farm account statistics from Statistic Denmark using financial performance indicators like {{the degree of}} profitability and farm solvency ratio shows an impressive organic trout sector. Though organic <b>trout</b> <b>farms</b> could not generate enough income from farm assets in 2010 and 2011, they picked up in 2012. Generally, organic <b>trout</b> <b>farms</b> tend to be equal or better in generating income per unit value of assets and have higher solvency ratios, indicating lower probability of default than alternative conventional <b>trout</b> <b>farms</b> and organic agricultural farms. An average organic <b>trout</b> <b>farm</b> was able to generate incomes of 8 % per unit value of assets and a solvency rate of 28 % for 2012, a value that economically outperforms other comparable farm units...|$|R
40|$|Physicochemical and {{biological}} changes downstream from a <b>trout</b> <b>farm</b> outlet: Comparing 1986 and 2006 sampling surveys In this investigation we compare {{the results obtained}} in the 1986 and 2006 sampling surveys regarding physicochemical {{and biological}} changes caused by a <b>trout</b> <b>farm</b> effluent in the upper Tajuña River (Guadalajara, Spain). For this comparison three sampling sites were selected: S- 1, placed upstream from the <b>trout</b> <b>farm,</b> {{was used as a}} reference station; S- 2 and S- 3 were respectively placed about 10 m and 1000 m downriver from the <b>trout</b> <b>farm</b> outlet. In both surveys, the concentration of nutrients (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate) increased downstream from the <b>trout</b> <b>farm,</b> whereas the concentration of dissolved oxygen decreased. Gammaridae, Heptageniidae, Elmidae, Perlidae, Ancylidae, Hydrobiidae, Glossosomatidae and Sericostomatidae significantly decreased their abundances downstream from the <b>trout</b> <b>farm</b> outlet. On the contrary, Tubificidae, Erpobdellidae, Glossiphoniidae, Planorbidae, Sphaeridae and Chironomidae were clearly favoured. The water quality in ecological terms, as assessed by biotic indices, was markedly reduced, with average scores (ASPT, ASPT′, a-BMWQ) showing a better indicator value than total scores (BMWP, BMWP′, BMWQ). Shredders and scrapers were the functional feeding groups most severely affected, whereas collectors were clearly favoured. We conclude that the wastewater depuration system of the <b>trout</b> <b>farm</b> must be improved since, during the last twenty years, it has been insufficient to prevent significant alterations in the recipient river...|$|R

2500|$|Autopolyploids are polyploids with {{multiple}} chromosome sets {{derived from a}} single taxon. Two examples of natural autopolyploids are the piggyback plant, Tolmiea menzisii and the white sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanum. [...] Most instances of autopolyploidy result from the fusion of unreduced (2n) gametes, which results in either triploid (n + 2n = 3n) or tetraploid (2n + 2n = 4n) offspring. Triploid offspring are typically sterile (as in the phenomenon of 'triploid block'), {{but in some cases}} they may produce high proportions of unreduced gametes and thus aid the formation of tetraploids. This pathway to tetraploidy {{is referred to as the}} “triploid bridge”. Triploids may also persist through asexual reproduction. In fact, stable autotriploidy in plants is often associated with apomictic mating systems. In agricultural systems, autotriploidy can result in seedlessness, as in watermelons and bananas. Triploidy is also utilized in salmon and <b>trout</b> <b>farming</b> to induce sterility.|$|E

In Romania, the mosttrout farms prefer to import the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by embryonated eggs which canbe marketed in a production cycle of 8 - 12 months.

By 1892 the White Brook Trout Hatchery was incorporated as the American Fish Culture Company with Rowland Hazard II as a minority shareholder. In 1899 the Hazard family gained controlling interest in the corporation. Upon the death of John W. Hoxie in 1903, the R.
