5|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} cause of <b>this</b> <b>accident</b> was the flight crew's {{operation of the}} airplane below the minimum descent altitude without an appropriate visual reference for the runway.|$|E
5|$|Based on its observations, the NTSB {{recommended}} to the FAA that design changes be implemented {{to improve the}} noticeability of TCAS annunciation, and that the FAA advise pilots of all aircraft to become {{more familiar with the}} details of <b>this</b> <b>accident,</b> potential loss of transponder and/or TCAS function, and how to recognize them.|$|E
5|$|In February 2000, {{a tree in}} the Adventureland section {{fell onto}} the DRR's Holiday Red freight train while it was in motion, {{damaging}} the awnings and their supports on the gondolas as well as knocking off the cupola {{on top of the}} caboose before the train came to a stop. No injuries occurred as a result of <b>this</b> <b>accident.</b>|$|E

5|$|The CAB {{issued the}} {{following}} Probable Cause statement:The Board determines the probable cause of <b>this</b> <b>accident</b> {{was the lack}} of command coordination and decision, lack of judgment, and lack of knowledge of the equipment resulting in loss of power in three engines creating an emergency situation which the crew could not handle.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} {{collected during}} this investigation strongly supports {{the conclusion that}} <b>this</b> <b>accident</b> was caused by N600XL and GOL1907 following ATC clearances which directed them to operate in opposite directions on the same airway at the same altitude resulting in a midair collision. The loss of effective air traffic control was {{not the result of}} a single error, but of a combination of numerous individual and institutional ATC factors, which reflected systemic shortcomings in emphasis on positive air traffic control concepts.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a {{significant}} number of accidents involving the Sea Harrier; <b>this</b> <b>accident</b> rate has caused approximately half the fleet to be lost with only 11 fighters remaining in service. Following a crash in August 2009, all Sea Harriers were temporarily grounded for inspection. Since the beginning of operational service in the Indian Navy, seven pilots have died in 17 crashes involving the Sea Harrier, usually during routine sorties.|$|E

5|$|Berg's {{observation}} of {{local high school}} students while preparing to film the movie inspired his development {{of some of the}} characters. For example, Jason Street, the character whose promising football career is ended by a spinal injury in the pilot, was inspired by a local event. David Edwards, a football player from San Antonio’s Madison High, was paralyzed during a November 2003 game. Berg was at the game when <b>this</b> <b>accident</b> occurred; he was profoundly affected by Edwards' injury and how it overturned his life. Berg set up a similar incident in the pilot.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, 1985, Japan Airlines Flight 123, a Boeing 747-146SR, {{suffered}} a rupture {{of the pressure}} bulkhead in its tail section, caused by undetected damage during a faulty repair to the rear bulkhead after a tailstrike seven years earlier. Pressurized air subsequently rushed out of the bulkhead and blew off the plane's vertical stabilizer, also severing all four of its hydraulic control systems. The pilots were {{able to keep the}} plane airborne for 32 minutes using differential engine power, but without any hydraulics or the stabilizing force of the vertical stabilizer, the plane eventually crashed in mountainous terrain. There were only 4 survivors among the 524 on board. <b>This</b> <b>accident</b> is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history.|$|E
5|$|On July10, 2008, {{a tanker}} truck {{full of water}} crashed into a tree along a portion of NY149 between Bay Road (CR7) and Ridge Road (NY9L) that {{features}} a sharp curve. After the first accident occurred at 3:10 a.m., a second tractor-trailer, who had stopped because of the tanker, rolled in reverse, jackknifing across the road and hitting a car. The road was shut down for the accident, where {{the driver of the}} tanker was taken to Glens Falls Hospital. The drivers of the car and the tractor-trailer that jackknifed were not hurt. The route was reopened by 11:40 a.m. <b>This</b> <b>accident</b> was one of many tractor-trailer accidents that has occurred on this stretch of NY149.|$|E
5000|$|On March 23, 2009, a Queens {{grand jury}} indicted Monserrate on three counts of felony assault on Giraldo and three counts of {{misdemeanor}} assault.If {{he had been}} convicted, the maximum sentence would have been seven years.

5|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} cause of <b>this</b> <b>accident</b> was {{the flight crew}} members' failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross-check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's nonpertinent conversations during taxi, {{which resulted in a}} loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances.|$|E
5|$|The Safety Board {{believes}} that the flight crew of Flight 405 should have taken more positive steps to assure a contamination-free wing, such as entering the cabin {{to look at the}} wing from a closer range. Although the Safety Board acknowledges that the detection of minimal amounts of contamination, sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems, is difficult and may not be possible without a tactile inspection, an observation from the cabin would have improved the chance of seeing some contamination and might have prompted the flight crew to return to the gate. The Safety Board {{believes that}} the flight crew’s failure to take such precautions and the decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing cleanliness led to <b>this</b> <b>accident</b> and is a cause of it.|$|E
5|$|While {{maintenance}} {{issues and}} not the actual design of the aircraft were ultimately found responsible for the crash, the accident and subsequent grounding of all DC-10s by the Federal Aviation Administration added to an already unfavorable reputation of the DC-10 aircraft {{in the eyes of}} the public, caused by several other incidents and accidents involving the type. The investigation also revealed other DC-10s with damage caused by the same faulty maintenance procedure. The faulty procedure was banned, and the aircraft type went on to have a long career as a passenger and cargo aircraft. In response to <b>this</b> <b>accident,</b> American Airlines was fined $500,000 by the U.S. government for improper maintenance procedures.|$|E
50|$|As of 2008, the {{automatic}} open level crossing {{adjacent to the}} station had been the site of {{almost half of the}} road traffic incidents at the five Metro-owned level crossings on the network. On 16 April 2008, Nexus announced plans to spend £60,000 installing enforcement cameras at the crossing in a bid {{to reduce the number of}} motorists who ignore the level crossing's warning lights. The cameras were in place by December 2008, but despite <b>this</b> <b>accidents</b> still occur, with a taxi being hit by a train at the crossing in September 2013.|$|R

5|$|After No.1 Long Range Flight was disbanded, Wing Commander Cuming {{returned}} to the ARDU. He was subsequently appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) on 31December 1953 for leading the flight and participating in the London-to-Christchurch air race. Squadron Leader Raw was also awarded the Air Force Cross {{for his role in}} the race, the decoration being presented to him by Queen Elizabeth II at Brisbane on 10March 1954. Raw had assumed command of No.2 Squadron on 18December; this was the first RAAF squadron to be equipped with Canberra bombers. Flight Lieutenant Francis Noel Davies, who had been Raw's co-pilot during the race, and two other airmen were killed on 16June 1954 when A84-202 crashed near Amberley. Wing Commander Cuming presided over the four-man court of inquiry which investigated the cause of <b>this</b> <b>accident.</b> As of May 2011, A84-201 was a gate guard at RAAF Base Amberley.|$|E
5|$|All {{preparations}} for the operation were completed by {{the first week of}} May and on 9 May the weather was nearly perfect for the attack. The British armada had collected at Dunkirk in Allied-held France and departed port shortly after dark. Two minutes after midnight, the force suffered a setback when Sappho suffered a minor boiler explosion and had to return to Dunkirk, unable to complete the journey. Although <b>this</b> <b>accident</b> halved the ability of the force to block Ostend, Lynes decided to continue the operation, and at 01:30, the force closed on the port, making the final {{preparations for}} the assault. Torpedoes fired from motor launches demolished machine gun posts on the ends of the piers marking the canal, beginning the attack. Ten heavy bombers of the newly formed Royal Air Force then dropped incendiary bombs on German positions, but did not cause significant damage. In spite of the fog, air operations continued as planned under the overall direction of Brigadier-General Charles Lambe. At {{the same time as the}} aerial bombardment began, the long range artillery of the Royal Marine Artillery opened fire on Ostend from Allied positions around the Belgian town of Ypres.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{was lucky}} to escape from a crash in the Masaryk Grand Prix. He and Chiron were chasing Fagioli when Fagioli crashed into a wooden footbridge, {{bringing}} it crashing down onto the road. Caracciola and Chiron drove into a ditch {{at the side of}} the road to avoid the debris; while Chiron drove out of the ditch and was able to continue, Caracciola drove into a tree and retired. Despite <b>this</b> <b>accident,</b> Caracciola again performed strongly in the Hillclimbing Championship; he won eight climbs in his SSKL to take the title. Perhaps his most significant achievement of 1931 was his win in the Mille Miglia. The local fleet of Alfa Romeos battled for the lead early in the race, but when they fell back Caracciola was able to take control. His win, in record time, made him and his co-driver Wilhelm Sebastian (who allowed Caracciola to drive the entire race) the first foreigners to win the Italian race. The only other foreigners to win the race on the full course were Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson in 1955.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Garuda Indonesia Flight 421 had {{to ditch}} {{in a river}} because of hail-induced engine flameouts, killing a flight {{attendant}} and injuring dozens of passengers. Prior to <b>this</b> <b>accident,</b> there were several other incidents of single or dual flameouts due to these weather conditions. After three incidents through 1998, CFMI made modifications to the engine to improve {{the way in which}} the engine handled hail ingestion. The major changes included a modification to the fan/booster splitter (making it more difficult for hail to be ingested by the core of the engine) and the use of an elliptical, rather than conical, spinner at the intake. These changes did not prevent the 2002 accident, and the investigation board found that the pilots did not follow the proper procedures for attempting to restart the engine, which contributed to the final result. Recommendations were made to better educate pilots on how to handle these conditions, as well as to revisit FAA rain and hail testing procedures. No further engine modifications were recommended.|$|E
5|$|In April 1989, {{one of the}} 707s transported 300 Australian Army {{personnel}} in two flights to Namibia {{as part of the}} Australian contribution to UNTAG, the United Nations Transition Assistance Group policing the country's transition to independence. Later that year, the squadron helped ferry members of the Australian public when the two domestic airlines were grounded during an industrial dispute; it was similarly employed in 1991 following the demise of Compass Airlines. On 29October 1991, one of the transport-configured 707s crashed into the sea during a training flight out of East Sale, Victoria; all five crew members were killed. The coronial inquest into <b>this</b> <b>accident</b> found that training in the asymmetric handling manoeuvre that caused the crash was deficient, and that the RAAF lacked a proper understanding of the handling characteristics of its 707s. The Coroner's first recommendation related to the need for appropriate simulation for this type of training, an area not properly recognised or addressed by the RAAF at the time. No.33 Squadron transported Australian troops to and from Somalia as part of Operation Solace in 1993.|$|E
5|$|In January 1953 Raw, who was by now a {{squadron}} leader, was appointed {{the commanding officer}} of No. 2 Squadron. On 23 February he also became the initial commander of No. 1 Long Range Flight, which had been formed {{to participate in the}} 1953 London to Christchurch air race using two of the RAAF's new English Electric Canberra bombers. He handed this position to Wing Commander Derek Cuming in May, but remained a member of the flight. In July Raw temporarily vacated his position at No. 2 Squadron so he could focus on preparing for the air race. The Canberras piloted by Raw and Cuming departed Australia for the United Kingdom on 10 September, and the race began on 9 October. Raw's aircraft suffered damage to its nose wheel while landing to refuel at Woomera, but was able to be repaired. <b>This</b> <b>accident</b> cost Raw the lead in the race. He arrived at Christchurch at 04:32 on 10 October, finishing second behind a RAF Canberra piloted by Flight Lieutenant Roland (Monty) Burton.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of June 30, 1956, United Flight 718 {{collided}} with TWA Flight 2 over the Grand Canyon, resulting in 128 deaths, which {{was at the time}} the largest loss of life in an aviation <b>accident.</b> <b>This</b> high-profile <b>accident,</b> which took place in uncontrolled airspace, raised public concern for airline safety. In 1957 Congress passed the Airways Modernization Act that established the Airways Modernization Board (AMB) headed by General Elwood Quesada.|$|R
