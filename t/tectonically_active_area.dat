In reference to the Late Pleistocene climatic chronology, two kinds of terraces can be distinguished: high-standing fill terraces probably deposited during glacial events and lower cut-in-fill and strath terraces cut during the postglacial river incision. A part of the terrace aggradations could have occurred during the Würmian glacial episodes. Hence, the dated terrace fits in with the prevailing view of incision during climate transitions. Our study also shows that elevation is not a good criterion of terrace correlation, which should be better carried out on the basis of absolute dating.

Very high fraction of first and second order streams point out the structural deformation, mainly as fractures, lineaments, and deformed litho units. The values of bifurcation ratio (Rb) for the Jamini watershed illustrate dissected mountainous nature of watersheds having high drainage integration and mature topography. The numerical value of asymmetry factor (AF) of the Sainam subwatershed pointed toward eastward shift in the channels. The paleochannels, meandercutoffs, and paleobars also correspond to the channel shift. Transverse topographic asymmetry (T) values of five subwatersheds of the Jamini river have revealed that the subwatersheds are also influenced by the regional tilt.

Internal thrusting (Gavrovo, internal and middle Ionian thrusts) activated synchronously with the major Pindos Thrust, creating intrabasinal highs that influenced palaeocurrent directions. The transfer faults cross-cut the intrabasinal highs and produced low relief areas that act as pathways for sediment distribution.

Modeling of the ice cap evolution is performed on a higher-resolution grid (i. e., 100 m) than previously (Braun et al., 1998). It predicts which parts of the landscape are, and have been, affected by glacial erosion. The model results highlight {{the complexity of the}} erosion patterns induced by ice caps and glaciers. Glacial erosion in a <b>tectonically</b> <b>active</b> <b>area</b> is, as suggested by the model, not uniform across the mountain range. Furthermore, high rock uplift rates, heavy precipitation, and climatic oscillations constantly interact. The feedback mechanisms are such that they render the landform very dynamic and transient.

Finally, the modeling results favor a tectonic model in the Southern Alps in which the maximum rock uplift is offset from the Alpine Fault...|$|E

An interesting area to study those phenomena is {{the northern part of the}} Upper Tiber Valley, which is characterized by the presence of a Low Angle Normal Fault, the so called Alto Tiberina Fault (ATF). The recent seismic activity of this fault line reflects the geodynamic behaviour in the regional stress field. Close to this fault zone, a 4. 8 km deep borehole PSS 1 is located which will be reopened at the end of 2010 to extract CO 2. This will possibly lead to a change in the hydraulic equilibrium in this region with potential consequences for the overall local geodynamics. Crustal deformation and microseismicity could be induced by the extraction. Fluid pressure changes and their influence to the hydraulic conduits up to the natural fluid emissions sites (mofettes) will be investigated as part of an actively controlled forcing experiment on this fault.

These measurements revealed well-defined linear anomalies that we interpret as being caused by active faults whose higher porosity than surrounding soils allows an increased CO 2 flux, carrying radon from beneath. These faults were not visible at the surface and were therefore revealed at high spatial resolution by our radon survey.

The Tertiary sedimentary section in this area (maximum thickness up to approximately 800 m) consist of siliciclastic rocks that generally correlate well with the established lithostratigraphical framework of the Netherlands.

The study area is characterized by active faulting and seismicity, and by historical destructive earthquakes. The total geomagnetic field intensity was synchronously sampled at the magnetometer sites since July 1989 and averaged on a daily basis.

We used a set of Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data to generate displacement maps using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). We detected a sliding zone of dimensions 2 km north–south by 0. 6 km east–west that threatens four villages. We estimated surface displacement of up to ∼ 30 cm/yr over the sliding body in the satellite line-of-sight (LOS) direction, with the largest displacement occurring after a local tectonic earthquake. We mapped the morphology of the landslide mass by aerial photography and field surveying. We found a complex set of interacting processes, including surface fracturing, shear and normal faults at both the headwall and the sides of the landslide, local landslide velocity changes, earthquake-induced velocity peaks, and loss in toe support due to mining activity. Important implications that are applicable elsewhere can be drawn from this study of coupled processes. We used inverse dislocation modelling to find a possible dislocation plane resembling the landslide basal décollement, and we used that plane to calculate the volume of the landslide.

This lack of empirical equations for PGV has led to widespread use of the practice of scaling peak velocity from the 5 %-damped response spectral ordinate at 1 sec, which is a poor substitute for direct prediction of the parameter. Responding to the need to provide equations for the prediction of PGV, this article derives new equations using the strong-motion database for the seismically <b>active</b> <b>areas</b> of Europe and the Middle East, following a new processing of all of the records. A total of 532 strong-motion accelerograms recorded at distances of up to 100 km from 131 earthquakes with moment magnitudes ranging from M 5 to 7. 6 are used to derive equations for both the larger and the geometric mean of the horizontal components. The predictions are found to be broadly consistent with those from previous European equations, and also with preliminary results from the Next Generation of Attenuation (NGA) project, suggesting that systematic differences in ground motions from active crustal regions, if any, are sufficiently small not to prevent the combined use of strong-motion data from southern Europe, western North America, and other <b>tectonically</b> <b>active</b> <b>areas</b> of shallow crustal seismicity...|$|R
