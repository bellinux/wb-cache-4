50|$|Mary Anderson (February 19, 1866 - June 27, 1953) was an American {{real estate}} developer, rancher, {{viticulturist}} and inventor of <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> blade. In November 1903 Anderson was granted her first patent for an automatic car window cleaning device controlled inside the car, called <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> is a bladed device used to wipe {{rain and}} dirt from a windshield. In 1903, Mary Anderson is {{credited}} with inventing <b>the</b> first operational <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper.</b> In Anderson's patent, she called her invention a window cleaning device for electric cars and other vehicles. Operated via a lever from inside a vehicle, her version of <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers</b> closely resembles <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> found on many early car models. Anderson had a model of her design manufactured. She then filed a patent (U.S. patent number 743,801) on June 18, 1903 that was issued to her by the U.S. Patent Office on November 10, 1903.|$|R

50|$|The {{classical}} forehand where {{a player}} hit through {{the ball and}} finished his follow-through above his shoulder was the dominant forehand usage for most of tennis history. Players as recent as Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi used the classical forehand. With recent tennis racquet technology improvements, generating power has increasingly become easier and hence having more control has become an emphasis for current professional tennis players. This {{has resulted in the}} pro players now using a <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> forehand where <b>the</b> follow-through ends up with the racquet ending across the body rather than over the shoulder. This enables more top spin to be imparted to the ball, thus controlling the extra power generated while still keeping the ball in court. Most pro players now use <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> forehand, with Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic among other pro tennis players all employing <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> forehand.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Determining {{the real}} {{behavior}} of <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> mechanisms {{is a priority}} in the design stage since {{the emergence of the}} computer graphic simulation. The paper attempts to analyze and simulate <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> systems by using a complex virtual prototyping platform, which integrates specific software solutions for realizing the 3 D solid model (CATIA), modeling the MBS mechanical model (ADAMS), and controlling the mechanism (MATLAB). For applying the design strategy, we considered a tandem pattern double-lever system, which is approached in the concurrent engineering concept, by integrating the control system in the mechanical model at the virtual prototype level. To drive the mechanism, a DC motor is used, the objective being to control the angular velocity of the rotor, which is the input parameter in the mechanical model; the output, which is transmitted to the controller, is the motor torque. Driving the system by using the motor torque is more realistic than attaching a motion generator and driving the motion directly...|$|R
