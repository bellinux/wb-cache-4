25|$|As a {{possible}} alternative to subway construction, engineer F. H. Behr proposed a monorail system for Brooklyn. Each car was proposed to carry 80 to 120 passengers and attain {{a speed of}} 100 miles per hour. An application was filed with the Board of Alderman for franchises for four routes, with the first running to South Brooklyn. It would have run from the intersection of Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue and down Fourth Avenue to 85th or 86th Streets, where it would turn eastward to Stillwell Avenue, where it would turn onto West 12th Street and continue to a <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> at Coney Island.|$|E

50|$|After the GLSt {{completed}} its planned network, {{it began to}} build <b>terminal</b> <b>loops</b> at important <b>terminals</b> where space was available (Bahnhof Leutzsch, Richard-Wagner-Straße (shared with LESt), Eutritzsch/Markt, Völkerschlachtdenkmal/Gletschersteinallee, Connewitz/Klemmstraße, Ludwig-/Bussestraße (Tauchaer Tor), Tabaksmühle).

In a manner similar to siRNA duplexes, one of the two strands, the [...] "passenger miRNA" [...] (miR-155*), is released and degraded while the other strand, designated the [...] "guide strand" [...] or [...] "mature miRNA" [...] (miR-155), is retained within the RISC.|$|E

50|$|On 7 October 1974, the {{tunneling}} {{work began}} {{to construct the}} <b>terminal</b> <b>loop,</b> which {{is connected to the}} Schwabstrasse station, branching structures, and 60-meter-long sections of two single-track tubes of the Hasenbergtunnel, started in 1979, to connect to the Gäubahn. The front section of the <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> is located in depleted anhydrite, which is brittle in consistency. For this reason, and because the thin vertical cover in the area, the rock above the tunnel roof ridge was stabilized by artificially freezing the ground water (Bodenvereisung). In the rear of the <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> section, undepleted anhydrite posed different problems, because this mineral, when it comes in contact with water, tends to massively expand, which puts enormous pressure on the tunnel structure. For this reason, the inner shell of the tunnel in the area is up to 1 metre thick.|$|E

5000|$|The TwoAYGGAY RNA motif is a conserved RNA {{structure}} {{identified by}} bioinformatics. [...] Its name {{refers to the}} conserved AYGGAY nucleotide sequence (Y refers to either an A or G nucleotide) found in the motif's two <b>terminal</b> <b>loops</b> (see diagram).

40|$|The {{terminal}} {{structure of}} the linear mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from three yeast species has been examined. By enzymatic digestion, alkali denaturation, and sequencing of cloned termini, it was shown that in Pichia pijperi and P. jadinii, both termini of the linear mtDNA were made of a single-stranded loop covalently joining the two strands, {{as in the case}} of vaccinia virus DNA. The left and right loop sequences were in either of two orientations, suggesting the existence of a flip-flop inversion mechanism. Contiguous to the <b>terminal</b> <b>loops,</b> inverted <b>terminal</b> repeats were present. The mtDNA from Williopsis mrakii seems to have an analogous structure, although <b>terminal</b> <b>loops</b> could not be directly demonstrated. Electron microscopy revealed the presence, among linear molecules, of a small number of circular DNAs, mostly of monomer length. Linear and circular models of replication are considered, and possible conversion mechanisms between linear and circular forms are discussed. A flip-flop inversion mechanism between the inverted repeat sequences within a circular intermediate may be involved in the generation of the linear form of mtDNA...|$|R
5000|$|Because {{of the new}} {{political}} situation the Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe was also restructured. As the first step, from 22 March 1949, the LVB was integrated with the [...] Kommunale Wirtschaftsunternehmen (KWU) Leipzig ("Local Economic Undertakings of Leipzig"). Some tramway track segments and connections were closed. On the other hand, many new reversing triangles (Knautkleeberg, Virchow-/Gottschallstraße, Großmarkthalle, Wiederitzsch, Johannisplatz, Emmausstraße, Böhlitz-Ehrenberg) and <b>terminal</b> <b>loops</b> (Markkleeberg-Mitte/Parkstraße, Märchenwiese, Plaut-/Demmeringstraße, Zentralstadion/Feuerbachstraße, Mockau/Post, Schkeuditz/Depot, Bf. Plagwitz, Markkleeberg-West) were built.|$|R
50|$|The {{front of}} the <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> is in leached Gipskeuper rock. Because this is fragile {{and the depth of}} rock is low, the rock above the tunnel roof was made stable by {{freezing}} it. There was a geological problem as the back of the <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> was situated in Gipskeuper layers containing anhydrite, which swell strongly when in contact with water, which is inevitable in a tunnel, and create strong forces {{on the sides of the}} tunnel. Accordingly, the inner shell of the tunnel is up to 1 m thick.|$|E

Up to the reorganization of the undertaking as the Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe (LVB, [...] "Leipzig Transport Company"), from 29 July 1938, the last large districts were connected to the tramway network.

5000|$|The mini-ykkC RNA motif (later renamed Guanidine-II riboswitch) was {{discovered}} as a putative RNA structure that is conserved in bacteria.
