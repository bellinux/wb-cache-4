60|$|If {{a prosperous}} modern man, {{with a high}} hat and a frock-coat, were to solemnly pledge himself before all his clerks and friends to count the leaves on every third tree in Holland Walk, to hop up to the City on one leg every Thursday, to repeat the whole of Mill's 'Liberty' seventy-six times, to collect 300 dandelions in fields {{belonging}} to anyone {{of the name of}} Brown, to remain for thirty-one hours holding his left ear in his right hand, to sing the names of all his aunts in order of age on the top of an omnibus, or make any such unusual undertaking, we should immediately conclude that the man was mad, or, as it is sometimes expressed, was 'an artist in life.' Yet these vows are not more extraordinary than the vows which in the Middle Ages and in similar periods were made, not by fanatics merely, but by the greatest figures in civic and national civilization--by kings, judges, poets, and priests. One man swore to chain two mountains together, and the great chain hung there, it was said, for ages as a monument of that mystical folly. Another swore that he would find his way to Jerusalem with a patch over his eyes, and died looking for it. It is not easy to see that these two exploits, judged from a strictly rational standpoint, are any saner than the acts above suggested. A mountain is commonly a stationary and reliable object which it is not necessary <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> <b>up</b> at night like a dog. And it is not easy at first sight to see that a man pays a very high compliment to the Holy City by setting out for it under conditions which render it to the last degree improbable that he will ever get there.|$|E

Von Nebula, seeking to take revenge over the wrongs he believed were inflicted upon him, recruited a number of infamous criminals to his cause. XPlode and his maniacal ally, Rotor, attack a shipment of explosives. The Alpha 1 Team is dispatched to guard the shipment, with Furno observing. XPlode abandons Rotor when the battle goes in the Heroes' favor. Stormer then states that it's Furno's job <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> <b>up</b> Rotor. However, due to his inexperience, the criminal manages to escape. The failure of the mission and Stormer's words make Furno train very hard to become a better Hero. Eventually, XPlode and Rotor strike an explosives plant, and when Stormer is felled, Furno manages to apprehend Rotor.|$|E
5000|$|King Sisyphus {{was sent}} to Tartarus for killing guests and {{travelers}} to his castle in violation to his hospitality, seducing his niece, and reporting one of Zeus' sexual conquests by telling the river god Asopus of the whereabouts of his daughter Aegina (who had been taken away by Zeus). But regardless of the impropriety of Zeus' frequent conquests, Sisyphus overstepped his bounds by considering himself a peer of the gods who could rightfully report their indiscretions. When Zeus ordered Thanatos <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> <b>up</b> Sisyphus in Tartarus, Sisyphus tricked Thanatos by asking him how the chains worked and ended up chaining Thanatos; {{as a result there}} was no more death. This caused Ares to free Thanatos and turn Sisyphus over to him. Sometime later, Sisyphus had Persephone send him back to the surface to scold his wife for not burying him properly. Sisyphus was forcefully dragged back to Tartarus by Hermes when he refused {{to go back to the}} Underworld after that. In Tartarus, Sisyphus was forced to roll a large boulder up a mountainside which when he almost reached the crest, rolled away from Sisyphus and rolled back down repeatedly. This represented the punishment of Sisyphus claiming that his cleverness surpassed that of Zeus, causing the god to make the boulder roll away from Sisyphus, binding Sisyphus to an eternity of frustration.|$|E
40|$|Semantic parsing, i. e., the {{automatic}} derivation of meaning representation {{such as an}} instantiated predicate-argument structure for a sentence, plays {{a critical role in}} deep processing of natural language. Unlike all other top systems of semantic dependency parsing that have to rely on a pipeline framework <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> <b>up</b> a series of submodels each specialized for a specific subtask, the one presented in this article integrates everything into one model, in hopes of achieving desirable integrity and practicality for real applications while maintaining a competitive performance. This integrative approach tackles semantic parsing as a word pair classification problem using a maximum entropy classifier. We leverage adaptive pruning of argument candidates and large-scale feature selection engineering to allow the largest feature space ever in use so far in this field, it achieves a state-of-the-art performance on the evaluation data set for CoNLL- 2008 shared task, on top of all but one top pipeline system, confirming its feasibility and effectiveness. 1...|$|E

40|$|In today’s businesses, {{there is}} a trend that service-oriented {{architecture}} (SOA) is evolving into a popular ar-chitectural paradigm for IT infrastructure. SOA allows companies ’ software systems to be shared as network-enabled electronic services with their commonly specified interfaces. Service discovery and composition are two emerging ones which are both fundamental and important to SOA. Service discovery occurs when software modules identify suitable services that meet pre-established require-ments based on the service descriptions. Service composi-tion takes one step further <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> <b>up</b> the discovered ser-vices as execution plans. To motivate and promote the research in the areas, the Web Services Challenge 2006 (WSC- 06) is organized and {{will take place at}} the joint 2006 CEC/EEE conferences. Building upon the success of the first two Web Services Challenges held at EEE- 05 and ICEBE- 05, WSC- 06 con-tains new challenges that consider not only exact match, but also subsumption relations between input and output types, thus simulating semantic search. The competition solicits academic and industry researchers to develop software sys-tems for discovering Web services and also composing them to create higher-level capabilities. ...|$|E
30|$|Coming {{across the}} {{limitations}} of the study, first off, this study has been performed on a small number of participants. Thus, no doubt, to put the particular outcomes out in the universe, data should be delivered by a larger sample of students in a longer passage of time. Clear about this limitation, acted on a relatively straightforward and common- sense methodology according with the ecological principles, we hope this piece can bring insight to the silent under-looked dynamic processes in systems contributing to the emerging patterns of English language teachers’ personal styles as long as the previous methodologies were often poor layers. Moreover, the present article has no intension providing an all-inclusive scrutiny of all these patterns and systems, but is to represent a more enhanced version of students’ real-time behavior. Besides, describing the dynamics of the construction of teachers’ personal styles in the class in terms of its underlying ecology seems rather complex. To do so, this study utilized an individual-level analysis. Therefore, significance testing is of no concern but rather triangulating qualitative data is made bold. The stronger these relationships come <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> <b>up</b> among the different drivers of data, the more trustworthy the inferences are being made.|$|E
40|$|With science team budgets being slashed, {{and a lack}} of {{adequate}} facilities for science payload teams to operate their instruments, there is a strong need for innovative new ground systems that are able to provide necessary levels of capability processing power, system availability and redundancy while maintaining a small footprint in terms of physical space, power utilization and cooling. The ground system architecture being presented is based off of heritage from several other projects currently in development or operations at Goddard, but was designed and built specifically {{to meet the needs of}} the Science and Planetary Operations Control Center (SPOCC) as a low-cost payload command, control, planning and analysis operations center. However, this SPOCC architecture was designed to be generic enough to be re-used partially or in whole by other labs and missions (since its inception that has already happened in several cases!) The SPOCC architecture leverages a highly available VMware-based virtualization cluster with shared SAS Direct-Attached Storage (DAS) to provide an extremely high-performing, low-power-utilization and small-footprint compute environment that provides Virtual Machine resources shared among the various tenant missions in the SPOCC. The storage is also expandable, allowing future missions <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> <b>up</b> to 7 additional 2 U chassis of storage at an extremely competitive cost if they require additional archive or virtual machine storage space. The software architecture provides a fully-redundant GMSEC-based message bus architecture based on the ActiveMQ middleware to track all health and safety status within the SPOCC ground system. All virtual machines utilize the GMSEC system agents to report system host health over the GMSEC bus, and spacecraft payload health is monitored using the Hammers Integrated Test and Operations System (ITOS) Galaxy Telemetry and Command (TC) system, which performs near-real-time limit checking and data processing on the downlinked data stream and injects messages into the GMSEC bus that are monitored to automatically page the on-call operator or Systems Administrator (SA) when an off-nominal condition is detected. This architecture, like the LTSP thin clients, are shared across all tenant missions. Other required IT security controls are implemented at the ground system level, including physical access controls, logical system-level authentication authorization management, auditing and reporting, network management and a NIST 800 - 53 FISMA-Moderate IT Security plan Risk Assessment Contingency Plan, helping multiple missions share the cost of compliance with agency-mandated directives. The SPOCC architecture provides science payload control centers and backup mission operations centers with a cost-effective, standardized approach to virtualizing and monitoring resources that were traditionally multiple racks full of physical machines. The increased agility in deploying new virtual systems and thin client workstations can provide significant savings in personnel costs for maintaining the ground system. The cost savings in procurement, power, rack footprint and cooling as well as the shared multi-mission design greatly reduces upfront cost for missions moving into the facility. Overall, the authors hope that this architecture will become a model for how future NASA operations centers are constructed...|$|E
