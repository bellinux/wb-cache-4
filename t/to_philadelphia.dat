5|$|After {{returning}} to New York on 31 May {{by way of}} Reykjavík and Halifax, West Cheswald made a brief trip <b>to</b> <b>Philadelphia</b> and back before she worked {{her way down the}} East Coast to Norfolk, Virginia, where she arrived on 17 June. Sailing the next day, the cargo ship began the first of two African trips, during which she made many of the same ports as in her two 1941 voyages. On the homeward leg of her second voyage, she called at Takoradi and Freetown on the western coast of Africa in March 1943. After {{returning to}} the Americas, West Cheswald visited Saint Thomas, San Juan, and Mayagüez in the Caribbean before returning <b>to</b> <b>Philadelphia</b> on 28 April.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to service, the ship {{took on a}} contingent of midshipmen for a training cruise to the Pacific.

She left the last port on 11 August and arrived back in Annapolis on 2 September. After disembarking the midshipmen there, she went <b>to</b> <b>Philadelphia,</b> where she remained for seven months. South Carolina returned to sea in early April 1921 for training off Culebra Island, followed by exercises in Chesapeake Bay. Another training cruise for midshipmen began on 29 May, this time to Europe. Ports of call included Christiana, Norway, and Lisbon, Portugal. She returned to Annapolis via Guantanmo Bay on 30 August before proceeding <b>to</b> <b>Philadelphia</b> the next day.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose Maréchal, {{who was now}} Archbishop of Baltimore, {{was ordered}} to oversee the diocese in Conwell's absence, and he {{appointed}} a priest from his diocese, William Matthews, as apostolic administrator. Conwell sailed for Rome on July 12, 1828. Once there, Conwell was ordered to give a report of all that had transpired. While forbidden {{to return to his}} diocese, he was promised that after a full explanation, he would be permitted to reside anywhere in Europe. He left Rome secretly in 1829, and when his absence was discovered, the Pope decreed he would be suspended from office if he returned <b>to</b> <b>Philadelphia.</b> Conwell did return <b>to</b> <b>Philadelphia,</b> however, in October of that year, and traveled from there to Baltimore, where the First Provincial Council of Baltimore was in session.|$|E

5|$|As Philadelphia became industrialized, {{immigrants}} from England, Ireland, and Germany {{settled in the}} city and the surrounding districts.

Recommissioned on 19 November 1873, the ship returned to Key West for fleet maneuvers and then proceeded to Pensacola, Florida. Manhattan departed {{the west coast of}} Florida and sailed to Port Royal, South Carolina on 25 April 1876. The ship patrolled off the Carolinas until June 1877, when she sailed to Norfolk, Virginia. The following year she was towed up the James River and moored at Brandon, Virginia. Manhattan {{was transferred}} to City Point, Virginia in 1881 and then to Richmond, Virginia. The ship was taken <b>to</b> <b>Philadelphia</b> and laid up at League Island in 1888, where she remained {{for the rest of her}} career. Manhattan was struck from the Navy List on 14 December 1901 and sold on 24 March 1902 for breaking up.|$|E
5|$|In June 1921, Conyngham {{accompanied}} a Cuban warship {{that was}} repatriating {{the remains of}} former Cuban President Jose Miguel Gómez to Havana.

5|$|In {{late summer}} of 1777, British General John Burgoyne led a major {{invasion}} army south from Quebec, {{with the intention}} of splitting off rebellious New England. But General Howe in New York took his army south <b>to</b> <b>Philadelphia</b> instead of going up the Hudson River to join with Burgoyne near Albany—a major strategic mistake. Meanwhile, Washington rushed <b>to</b> <b>Philadelphia</b> to engage Howe, while closely following the action in upstate New York, where the patriots were led by General Philip Schuyler and his successor Horatio Gates. The ensuing pitched battles at Philadelphia were too complex for Washington's relatively inexperienced men and they were defeated.|$|E

5|$|The {{resistance}} came to {{a climax}} in 1794. In May of that year, federal district attorney William Rawle issued subpoenas for more than 60 distillers in Pennsylvania who had not paid the excise tax. Under the law then in effect, distillers who received these writs would be obligated to travel <b>to</b> <b>Philadelphia</b> to appear in federal court. For farmers on the western frontier, such a journey was expensive, time-consuming, and beyond their means. At the urging of William Findley, Congress modified this law on June 5, 1794, allowing excise trials {{to be held in}} local state courts. But by that time, U.S. marshal David Lenox had already been sent to serve the writs summoning delinquent distillers <b>to</b> <b>Philadelphia.</b> Attorney General William Bradford later maintained that the writs were meant to compel compliance with the law, and that the government did not actually intend to hold trials in Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|With {{the death}} of his last {{contemporary}} on the faculty in 1845, Tucker resigned his professorship and moved <b>to</b> <b>Philadelphia,</b> where he enjoyed the availability of more libraries, meetings at the American Philosophical Society and a reunion with his friend Robley Dunglison. Nevertheless, there were drawbacks – for one, the lack of accommodation that slaveholding had brought him—he had emancipated all five of his slaves upon his departure from Charlottesville. He later expressed doubt about the wisdom of the latter decision when he learned that three of them had, by law, been exiled from Virginia, and shortly thereafter died. As well, the two freed slaves who accompanied him <b>to</b> <b>Philadelphia</b> immediately deserted their posts upon arrival there.|$|E
