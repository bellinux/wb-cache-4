5|$|Nelson {{returned}} to Palermo in August and in September became the senior {{officer in the}} Mediterranean after Jervis' successor Lord Keith left to chase the French and Spanish fleets into the Atlantic. Nelson {{spent the rest of}} 1799 at the Neapolitan court but put to sea again in February 1800 after Lord Keith's return. On 18 February Généreux, a survivor of the Nile, was sighted and Nelson gave chase, capturing her after a short battle and winning Keith's approval. Nelson had a difficult relationship with his superior officer: he was gaining a reputation for insubordination, having initially refused to send ships when Keith requested them and on occasion returning to Palermo without orders, pleading poor health. Keith's reports, and rumours of Nelson's close relationship with Emma Hamilton, were also circulating in London, and Earl Spencer wrote a pointed letter suggesting that he return home: You {{will be more likely to}} recover your health and strength in England than in any inactive situation at a foreign Court, however pleasing the respect and gratitude shown <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> your services may be.|$|E

[...] "Bye Bye" [...] begins with an understated chorus, then working into the first verse, in which Carey retells her childhood, and her relationship with her father years ago: [...] "As a child there were them times / I didn't get it, but you kept me alive / I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes / And its more than saying 'I miss you' / But I'm glad we talked through / All them grown full things separation brings / You never let me know it, you never let it show". Then, the pre-chorus continues describing Carey's emotions in the present, [...] "And everyday life goes on / I wish I could talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> a while", and how the loss of her father still affects her day-to-day life.|$|E

500|$|Anne's father {{continued}} his diplomatic career under Henry VIII. In Europe, Thomas Boleyn's charm won many admirers, including Margaret of Austria, daughter of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. During this period, Margaret ruled the Netherlands on her nephew Charles's behalf {{and was so}} impressed with Boleyn that she offered his daughter Anne a place in her household. Ordinarily, a girl had to be twelve years old to have such an honour, but Anne may have been younger, as the Archduchess affectionately referred to her as [...] "la petite Boulin [...] ". Anne made a good impression in the Netherlands with her manners and studiousness, Margaret reported that she was well spoken and pleasant for her young age. and told Sir Thomas Boleyn that his daughter was [...] "so presentable and so pleasant, considering her youthful age, that I am more beholden <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> sending her to me, than you to me" [...] (E.W. Ives, op.cit.). Anne stayed with Margaret from spring 1513 until her father arranged for her to attend Henry VIII's sister Mary, who was about to marry Louis XII of France in October 1514.|$|E
500|$|Billingsley's {{generosity}} was {{not confined}} {{to those who were}} always at the club. [...] He received the following letter in 1955: [...] "I am grateful <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> your thoughtful kindness in sending me such a generous selection of attractive neckties. At the same time may I once again thank you for the cigars that you regularly send to the White House." [...] It was signed by Dwight D. Eisenhower. During World War II, three bomber planes were christened with the name of the Stork Club. [...] Billingsley commissioned Tiffany & Co. to produce sterling silver Stork Club logo Victory pins as gifts for their crew members. Patrons were not always on the receiving end; Billingsley's writings claimed that one of his waiters received a $20,000 tip. [...] A bartender received a new Cadillac from a grateful patron, and a headwaiter received a $10,000 tip from tennis star Fred Perry. It was necessary for Billingsley to give the expensive gifts and to provide some or all of a celebrity's Stork Club services for free to bring the stars to the club and keep them coming back. The notables were what brought {{people from all over the}} country in all walks of life to visit the Stork Club.|$|E
500|$|The fourth error, {{according}} to Peter the Venerable, {{was that the}} Petrobrusians denied sacramental grace, [...] rejecting the rite of Communion entirely, let alone {{the doctrine of the}} real presence or the nascent Scholastic account of transubstantiation. “They deny, not only the truth of the body and blood of the Lord, daily and constantly offered in the church through the sacrament, but declare that it is nothing at all, and ought not to be offered to God. They say, 'Oh, people, do not believe the bishops, priests, or clergy who seduce you; who, as in many things, so {{in the office of the}} altar, deceive you when they falsely profess to make the body of Christ, and give it <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> the salvation of your souls.'" [...] The term [...] "transubstantiation", used to describe the transformation of the consecrated bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, was first used by Hildebert de Lavardin in about 1079. This theory had long been widely accepted as orthodox doctrine at the time of the attacks by Peter of Bruys. In less than two centuries, in 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council officially declared transubstantiation the necessary, orthodox Catholic explanation of the Eucharist.|$|E

500|$|Hunger {{and desperation}} {{eventually}} forced Sitting Bull, and 186 {{of his family}} and followers, to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester lever-action carbine to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford, Sitting Bull said to Major David H. Brotherton, [...] "I wish it to be remembered that I was the last man of my tribe to surrender my rifle." [...] To the Oglala Lakotas, Dakotas and Nakota, [...] "to surrender my rifle" [...] in this context meant [...] "We have killed enough white men with your own rifles so I give this rifle back <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>for</b> Tunkasila Wakantanka (Grandfather Great Mystery) will use a different way to help us overcome the white man." [...] In the parlor of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day, he told the four soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency. This reservation straddles the present-day boundary between North and South Dakota.|$|E
500|$|The horses {{who have}} served as Thunder {{have been trained to}} remain calm in {{situations}} that would normally cause a horse to respond with a fight-or-flight response, such as the flashing explosions of a pyrotechnic display, or items suddenly landing on the field including skydivers with parachutes and various objects thrown by spectators, or loud music and the sounds associated {{with tens of thousands of}} cheering fans at Mile High. Ann Judge has explained that because so many unexpected things can happen, it is important that the people working with him remain calm; it is trust in his rider and handlers, not just desensitization, that helps the horse remain steady: [...] "You want them to look <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> the appropriate response and for confidence and faith so that the flight response doesn’t get initiated." [...] She describes the process by saying, [...] "if something is fearful to him, as long as he looks to me, and I tell him he’s OK, he’s OK." [...] The only frightening stimuli that was an ongoing problem for both Thunder Sr. and Thunder II was when the crowd would perform the wave; Thunder Sr. would stand still, but tremble. Thunder II would become tense, requiring ground handlers and his rider to help steady him. Thunder III is the first of the mascots to tolerate wearing earplugs, which help protect his hearing from loud noises during games.|$|E
500|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the first three}} episodes, The New York Times saw in [...] "prim, righteous Brother Justin [...] more of a caricature, but Clancy Brown finds ways to bring some subtle glints of personality to the role." [...] Time commented, [...] "Brother Justin {{comes across as a}} typical whited sepulcher [...] if there's one thing more trite than a dwarf in a surreal drama, it's a preacher with a dark side [...] and Brown's campy performance largely involves shouting 'Enough!' and 'No-o-o-o!' with horror-flick pathos." [...] Entertainment Weekly considered Brown's Brother Justin [...] "delightfully unsettling as the creepy evangelist taking his orders from the wrong superpower", and Variety thought Brown was doing [...] "a superb job straddling the line between stoic and menacing, and there are hints about his weaknesses, conveyed quickly with subtlety." [...] A season 1 DVD review by DVD Talk saw Clancy Brown's performance as [...] "nothing short of brilliant. [...] Brown also has a difficult task capturing the duality of Brother Justin, a man who presents a physically intimidating presence but who wants little more than to be a subdued and loyal servant of his Lord, and he succeeds on every level." [...] DVDverdict stated in a season 2 review that [...] "Brown's presence and charisma is dazzling; he is both likable and frightening. He is an actor {{with a great deal of}} range, and he uses all of it in this series." [...] Referring to Brown's portrayal as [...] "a man of God in Carnivale", the Los Angeles Times saw Brown's [...] "eyes always betray him as someone who, all things considered, would probably be happier caving in your skull and smoking a cigarette afterward than talking <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> another minute." [...] Time Magazine's James Poniewozik depicted the Boardwalk Empire character Nelson Van Alden (played by Michael Shannon) as [...] "such a histrionic, guilt-wracked, damnation-obsessed monster that he reminds me of Brother Justin".|$|E

500|$|With Barrett {{seemingly}} {{detached from}} proceedings, {{it came down}} to Waters and Wright to provide adequate material. The opening, [...] "Let There Be More Light", penned by Waters, continues the space rock approach established by Barrett. [...] "Let There Be More Light" [...] evolved from a bass riff that was part of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive". Both [...] "Remember a Day" [...] and [...] "See-Saw" [...] use the childlike approach that was established on their debut. Wright remained critical of his early contributions to the band. [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" [...] was first performed with Barrett in 1967. The success of the track was such that it remained in their live setlist until 1973 where it appeared in a greatly extended form. Waters later performed the track during solo concerts from 1984 and later. Waters borrowed the lyrics from a book of Chinese poetry from the Tang Dynasty, like Barrett had used in [...] "Chapter 24". [...] "Corporal Clegg", is the first Pink Floyd song to address issues of war, a theme which would endure throughout the career of Waters as a songwriter for the band, culminating on the 1983 album The Final Cut. [...] "A Saucerful of Secrets" [...] was originally written as a new version of [...] "Nick's Boogie". The track is titled as four parts, on Ummagumma. A staple in the band's live set until summer 1972, a live version of the song was recorded on 27 April 1969 at the Mothers Club in Birmingham for inclusion on Ummagumma. [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] refers to Barrett's departure from the group ("It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here / And I'm most obliged <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> making it clear that I'm not here"). A promotional video was recorded for the track. The band's management wanted to release the song as a single, before being vetoed by both the band and producer Norman Smith.|$|E
500|$|While Staunton {{was busy}} with the Shakespeare edition, he {{received}} a courteous letter from the New Orleans Chess Club, inviting him to that city to play Paul Morphy, who had won the recent First American Chess Congress. Staunton replied, thanking the New Orleans Chess Club and Morphy [...] "for the honor implied in your selection of me as the opponent of such a champion" [...] and pointing {{out that he had}} not competed for several years and was working six days a week (on editing Shakespeare), and that he could not possibly travel across the Atlantic for a match. He also wrote in The Illustrated London News that he had [...] "been compelled, by laborious literary occupation, to abandon the practice of chess, beyond the indulgence of an occasional game...If Mr. Morphy—for whose skill we entertain the liveliest admiration—be desirous to win his spurs among the chess chivalry of Europe, he must take advantage of his purposed visit next year; he will then meet in this country, in France, in Germany and in Russia, many champions... ready to test and do honor to his prowess."In reply to your very courteous proposal for me to visit New Orleans for the purpose of encountering Mr. Paul Morphy at Chess, permit me to mention that for many years professional duties have compelled me to abandon the practice of the game almost entirely except in the most desultory manner, and at the present time these duties are so exacting that it is with difficulty I am enabled to snatch one day out of seven for exercise and relaxation.Under the circumstances you will at once perceive that a long and arduous chess contest, even in this Metropolis, would be an enterprise too formidable for me to embark in without ample opportunity for the recovery of my old strength in play, together with such arrangements as would prevent the sacrifice of my professional engagements {{for the sake of a}} match at chess, and that the idea of undertaking one in a foreign country, many thousand miles from here, is admissible only in a dream.With friendly greetings to my proposed antagonist, whose talent and enthusiasm no one can more highly estimate, and with compliments <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> the honour implied in your selection of me as the opponent of such a champion, I beg to subscribe myself, with every consideration.Yours obediently,H. Staunton"—from Evidently reprinted from [...] Chess historian H. J. R. Murray wrote that Staunton's letter and article should have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of the offer, but that Morphy interpreted them differently, and one of the main reasons for his visit to Europe in 1858 was the hope of playing a match with Staunton. Some other chess historians disagree with Murray's interpretation of Staunton's response. Staunton did offer to play Morphy by electric telegraph, a technology whose progress and uses for chess he reported enthusiastically. However this offer arrived after Morphy had left for Europe—which perhaps was fortunate, as the newly laid cable broke down after a month and was not replaced until 1866.|$|E
