5|$|All in all, a GRB {{within a}} few parsecs, with its energy {{directed}} towards Earth, will mostly damage life by raising the UV levels during the burst itself {{and for a few}} years thereafter. Models show that the destructive effects of this increase can cause up to 16 times the normal levels of DNA damage. It has proved difficult to assess a reliable evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> on the terrestrial ecosystem, because of the uncertainty in biological field and laboratory data.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, he {{was named}} in the {{preliminary}} 25 man squad to represent Queensland in the opening State of Origin match for 2009 and was subsequently picked on the interchange bench for the opening State of Origin match on 3 June. Hunt came on in the 25th minute of the game to replace the injured Justin Hodges and played in his centre position {{for the remainder of}} the match which Queensland won. <b>The</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> game would be felt as part of the 2009 swine flu pandemic in Australia. Hunt's Queensland teammate Ben Hannant tested positive to the Swine influenza and the Brisbane Broncos subsequently put all of their Origin players in quarantine.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> action {{reverberate}} to this day; {{the assets}} were never returned, {{and although the}} ban on rugby league was lifted, it was prevented from calling itself rugby from 1949 to the mid-1980s, having to use the name Jeu à Treize (Game of Thirteen, {{in reference to the}} number of players in a rugby league side).|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{heavy rain}} falling on {{saturated}} catchments {{with absolutely no}} drying westerly winds was disastrous. Most rivers {{on the coast of}} New South Wales, and many further inland, reached record levels. Food shortages were particularly prevalent in Sydney and surrounding cities, and railways and roads were repeatedly cut as each successive storm flooded all major rivers. Vegetable crops on the Hawkesbury River were hardest hit, with most being completely destroyed and prices skyrocketing.|$|E
25|$|On March 1, 1954, a {{group of}} four Nationalists, which {{included}} Lolita Lebrón, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Andrés Figueroa Cordero, and Irvin Flores, unfurled a Puerto Rican flag and opened fire on the Representatives of the 83rd Congress, {{with the intention of}} capturing worldwide attention to the cause of Puerto Rican independence, wounding five congressmen. One of <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> event was the arrest of Albizu Campos, who at the time was in ill health. Reynolds, with the aid of the American League for Puerto Rico's Independence, helped to defend Albizu Campos and the four Nationalists involved in the shooting incident.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Romania {{joined the}} Entente, waging a {{disastrous}} war on Austria-Hungary. Cătărău again applied {{to join the}} Romanian Land Forces, but his request was denied. During the Romanian retreat of 1916, Cătărău escaped his place of detention, and wandered around Neamț County. He was urgently apprehended, and moved to Durău. He was still there when the February Revolution broke out in Russia, and witnessed <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> event on Romanian morale. He escaped custody and left for Iași, the Romanian provisional capital. He kept company with other Bessarabian refugees, among them Okhrana informant Alexis Nour.|$|E

25|$|The {{structure}} of plant-pollinator networks may have large {{consequences for the}} way in which pollinator communities respond to increasingly harsh conditions. Mathematical models, examining <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> network structure for the stability of pollinator communities suggest that the specific way in which plant-pollinator networks are organized minimizes competition between pollinators and may even lead to strong indirect facilitation between pollinators when conditions are harsh. This means that pollinator species together can survive under harsh conditions. But it also means that pollinator species collapse simultaneously when conditions pass a critical point. This simultaneous collapse occurs, because pollinator species depend on each other when surviving under difficult conditions.|$|E
25|$|On 20 November 2013, a Class 221 Super Voyager {{diesel-electric}} {{multiple unit}} from London Euston to Chester {{collided with the}} buffer stops on platform 1, riding up over them and smashing a glass screen. There were no injuries, although one passenger was taken to hospital for checks. A Rail Accident Investigation Branch report stated that the incident was due to exceptionally slippery rails, but that <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> were made more severe by the buffer stop being of an older design, which did not absorb the impact energy effectively. The report further stated that that particular stop had not undergone a risk assessment within the previous ten years, and was possibly not appropriate for class 221 units.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant Brian W. Rice, age 41, is a 17-year-veteran of the force. Rice, who was {{promoted}} to lieutenant in 2011, is the highest-ranking officer charged in relation to Gray's death. The Guardian reported that, in 2012, Rice had allegedly threatened to kill himself and the husband of his former partner. He had been hospitalized, reportedly, for a mental health evaluation and given an administrative suspension. <b>The</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> threat included twice having his guns confiscated, and a restraining order {{on behalf of the}} husband of his former partner. According to a police report obtained by The Guardian, Rice had also misused his position to order the arrest of his ex-girlfriend's husband as part of a personal dispute that took place two weeks before the incident.|$|E

25|$|With the {{discovery}} of recombinant DNA by Cohen and Boyer in 1973, the idea that genetic engineering would have major human and societal consequences was born. In July 1974, a group of eminent molecular biologists headed by Paul Berg wrote to Science suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> work were so potentially destructive {{that there should be}} a pause until its implications had been thought through. This suggestion was explored at a meeting in February 1975 at California's Monterey Peninsula, forever immortalized by the location, Asilomar. Its historic outcome was an unprecedented call for a halt in research until it could be regulated in such a way that the public need not be anxious, and it led to a 16-month moratorium until National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines were established.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Teimuraz {{relations}} with the new Iranian shah, Safi, progressively deteriorated. In 1631, Teimuraz avenged the mountainous tribes of Dagestan for having joined Shah Abbas {{in the destruction of}} Kakheti, and devastated several of their settlements (auls). In 1633, he gave shelter to his brother-in-law Daud Khan, the Iranian governor (beglarbeg) of Ganja and Karabakh of Georgian extraction, who had fled Shah Safi’s crackdown on the family of his brother Imam-Quli Khan, the influential governor of Fars, Lar and Bahrain. Teimuraz refused to surrender the fugitive, and, fully appreciating <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> refusal, gathered his forces in haste. Shah Safi retaliated by declaring Teimuraz deposed and replacing him with his favorite, a Muslim Georgian prince Khusraw Mirza (Rostom), who had {{played an important role in}} consolidating Safi’s hold of power after Shah Abbas’s death.|$|E
25|$|Several miRNA {{modifications}} affect miRNA stability. As {{indicated by}} {{work in the}} model organism Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress), mature plant miRNAs appear to be stabilized {{by the addition of}} methyl moieties at the 3' end. The 2'-O-conjugated methyl groups block the addition of uracil (U) residues by uridyltransferase enzymes, a modification that may be associated with miRNA degradation. However, uridylation may also protect some miRNAs; <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> modification are incompletely understood. Uridylation of some animal miRNAs has been reported. Both plant and animal miRNAs may be altered by addition of adenine (A) residues to the 3' end of the miRNA. An extra A added to the end of mammalian miR-122, a liver-enriched miRNA important in hepatitis C, stabilizes the molecule and plant miRNAs ending with an adenine residue have slower decay rates.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{discovery}} was, that {{a conspiracy}} {{was formed to}} dethrone and destroy the usurper. The plot was successful. Smerdis was killed; his imprisoned queens were set free, and Darius was raised to the throne in his stead.|$|R

5000|$|Modal Necessitarianism (associated with Saul Kripke), {{argues for}} the {{veracity}} of the modal system [...] "Triv" [...] (If P is true, then P must be true). <b>The</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> theory is that all properties are essential (and no property is an accident).|$|R
25|$|The {{loans from}} Chiang {{were to be}} repaid with the {{proceeds}} {{from the sale of}} the flat. Following this, Mislia asked for two more loans from Chiang, which Shankar helped to arrange. In total, she signed three agreements to borrow a sum of $88,500, consisting of $45,000, $30,000 and $13,500 on three separate occasions. However, Mislia claimed she only received $40,000, consisting of $25,000, $10,000 and $5,000 on each of the occasions. Four years later, the complainants lodged a complaint against Shankar with the Law Society of Singapore. Following an investigation, Shankar was tried by the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society and convicted of three counts of grossly improper conduct contrary to section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act. The charges were based on allegations that Shankar had acted for both the complainants and Chiang without advising the complainants of <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> conflict of interest, that he had not taken full instructions from the complainants, that he had asked the complainants to sign documents without properly explaining their effect, and that he had not ascertained whether the sums of money that Chiang paid to Mislia were in line with the loan agreements.|$|E
25|$|In Merriman's hands, the {{convention}} {{is made to}} take an unusual twist. The woman drags the poet {{to the court of}} the fairy queen Aoibheal. There follows a court case in which a young woman calls on Aoibheal to take action against the young men of Ireland for their refusal to marry. She is answered by an old man who first laments the infidelity of his own young wife and the dissolute lifestyles of young women in general. He then calls on the queen to end the institution of marriage completely and to replace it with a system of free love. The young woman returns to mock the old man's inability to satisfy his young wife's needs and to call {{for an end to the}} celibacy among the clergy so as to widen the pool of prospective mates. Finally, Aoibheal rules that all men must mate by the age of 21, that older men who fail to satisfy women must be punished, that sex must be applauded, not condemned, and that priests will soon be free to marry. To his dismay, the poet discovers that he is to be the first to suffer <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new law, but then awakens to find it was just a nightmare. In its frank treatment of sexuality and of clerical celibacy, Cúirt An Mheán Oíche is a unique document in the history of Irish poetry in either language.|$|E
