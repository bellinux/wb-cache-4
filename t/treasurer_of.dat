5|$|Alexander was {{a nephew}} of Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, {{probably}} {{the son of}} Roger's brother Humphrey. His mother's name, Ada, is known from the Lincoln Cathedral libri memoriales, or obituary books. Alexander's brother David was archdeacon of Buckingham in the diocese of Lincoln. Other relatives included Nigel, another nephew of Roger's; and Adelelm, later <b>Treasurer</b> <b>of</b> England, who was recorded as Roger's nephew but perhaps was his son.

Alexander's cousin Nigel had a son, Richard FitzNeal, who later became <b>Treasurer</b> <b>of</b> England and Bishop of London. Alexander also had a nephew William, who became an archdeacon, and a great-nephew named Robert de Alvers.|$|E
