25|$|Darius Just had {{previously}} helped novice writer Giles Devore produce a breakthrough novel. Just credits himself with ruthlessly editing Devore's original drafts and forcing the young author to turn an incoherent mess into a masterwork. Having gained {{fame and fortune}} with his first book, a bestseller, Devore attends the ABA convention to promote his second book, which he wrote without Just's help. Just volunteers to run an errand for Devore – collecting a parcel for him and taking it to his hotel room – but he forgets to do so until the next day. Entering Devore's hotel room, Just discovers Devore dead in the bathroom, apparently having slipped in the shower and hit {{his head on the}} faucets. Others take this to be a tragic accident and nothing more, but Just suspects murder, based on Devore's compulsive <b>tidiness</b> and the disarray in which Just found the room. He interviews Devore's ex-wife, who tells him that the parcel contained Devore's monogrammed pens.|$|E
500|$|Williams did {{not produce}} any ethical theory or system; several {{commentators}} noted, unfairly {{in the view of}} his supporters, that he was largely a critic. Moore writes that Williams was unaffected by this criticism: [...] "He simply refused to allow philosophical system-building to eclipse the subtlety and variety of human ethical experience." [...] He equated ethical theories with [...] "a <b>tidiness,</b> a systematicity, and an economy of ideas," [...] writes Moore, that were not up to describing human lives and motives. Williams tried not to lose touch [...] "with the real concerns that animate our ordinary ethical experience," [...] unlike much of the [...] "arid, ahistorical, second-order" [...] debates about ethics in philosophy departments.|$|E
500|$|The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter, and published by Frederick Warne & Co. in 1910. [...] The tale is about housekeeping and insect pests in the home, and reflects Potter's own sense of <b>tidiness</b> and her abhorrence of insect infestations. The character of Mrs. Tittlemouse debuted in 1909 in a small but crucial role in The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies, and Potter decided to give her a tale of her own the following year. Her meticulous illustrations of the insects may have been drawn for their own sake, or to provoke horror and disgust in her juvenile readers. 25,000 copies of the tale were initially released in July 1910 and another 15,000 between November 1910 and November 1911 in Potter's typical small book format.|$|E
500|$|As Minister, Joseph oversaw a [...] "back-to-basics approach" [...] to tourism, {{attempting}} {{to have the}} nation perceived as one known [...] "for its cleanliness, <b>tidiness,</b> natural beauty and pristine environment". As part of this, the Antiguan government invested 2 million US dollars in boosting the number of hotel rooms available, from 3,000 to 5,000, and opened the Antigua Hotel Institute, seeking to train Antiguans in how to more efficiently and effectively work in the tourism industry. Joseph also oversaw the government buying {{a third of the}} Jolly Beach Resort in an attempt to save it from bankruptcy, establishing a management company to oversee the property. In February 2000 he led the government delegation in an official visit to Beijing, where they met with Jiang Zhenghua, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, to discuss [...] "bilateral relations and the issues of common concern". He also led the Antiguan delegation to the World Travel Market in 2001. Following Joseph's promise of government investiture in the route, Air Jamaica resumed flights to Antigua in 2002, having ceased flying there six years earlier. This was followed by the announcement that Air Luxor would similarly begin offering flights to the islands.|$|E
2500|$|As a boy, Bogart was teased for his curls, <b>tidiness,</b> the [...] "cute" [...] {{pictures}} {{his mother}} had him pose for, the Little Lord Fauntleroy clothes she dressed him in, and even for the name [...] "Humphrey". From his father, Bogart inherited a tendency to needle, fondness for fishing, lifelong love of boating, and an attraction to strong-willed women.|$|E
2500|$|Biographer Myra Friedman commented in her {{original}} version of Buried Alive {{that was published}} in hardback in 1973, Given the near-infinite potentials of infancy, it is really impossible to make generalizations about what lies behind sexual practices. [...] This, however, is probable: to become clearly homosexual, to make the choice that one honestly prefers relations with one's own sex, no matter the origins of such preference, requires a certain integration, a stability of psychic development, a <b>tidiness</b> of personality organization. [...] The ridicule and the humiliation that took place at that most delicate period in [...] early teens, her own inability to surmount the obstacles to regular growth, devastated her {{a great deal more}} than most people comprehended. [...] Janis was not heir to an ego so cohesive as to permit her an identity one way or the other. [...] She was, as [...] Mr. [...] Giarritano put it , [...] "diffused" [...] -- spewing, splattering, splaying all over, without a center to hold. [...] That had {{as much to do with}} {{her original}} use of drugs [...] as did the critical component of guilt and its multiplicity of sources above and beyond the contribution made by her relationships with women. [...] Were she so simple as the lesbians wished her to be or so free as her associates imagined! ...|$|E
2500|$|The satirist in Tsvetaeva plays second fiddle {{only to the}} poet-lyricist. Several satirical poems, moreover, {{are among}} Tsvetaeva's best-known works: [...] "The Train of Life" [...] ("Poezd zhizni") and [...] "The Floorcleaners' Song" [...] ("Poloterskaya"), both {{included}} in After Russia, and The Rat-catcher (Krysolov, 1925–1926), a long, folkloric narrative. The target of Tsvetaeva's satire is everything petty and petty bourgeois. Unleashed against such dull creature comforts is the vengeful, unearthly energy of workers both manual and creative. In her notebook, Tsvetaeva writes of [...] "The Floorcleaners' Song": [...] "Overall movement: the floorcleaners ferret out a house's hidden things, they scrub a fire into the door... What do they flush out? Coziness, warmth, <b>tidiness,</b> order... Smells: incense, piety. Bygones. Yesterday... The growing force of their threat is far stronger than the climax." [...] The poem which Tsvetaeva describes as liricheskaia satira, The Rat-Catcher, is loosely based on {{the legend of the}} Pied Piper of Hamelin. The Rat-Catcher, which is also known as The Pied Piper, is considered by some to be the finest of Tsvetaeva's work. It was also partially an act of homage to Heinrich Heine's poem Die Wanderratten. The Rat-Catcher appeared initially, in serial format, in the émigré journal Volia Rossii in 1925-1926 whilst still being written. It was not to appear in the Soviet Union until after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1956. Its hero is the Pied Piper of Hamelin who saves a town from hordes of rats and then leads the town's children away too, in retribution for the citizens' ingratitude. As in the other folkloric narratives, The Ratcatcher's story line emerges indirectly through numerous speaking voices which shift from invective, to extended lyrical flights, to pathos.|$|E

You don't want last year's hats there, do you, any more than last year's leaves? The wind takes off the leaves, but it couldn't manage the hat; that wind, I suppose, has tidied whole forests to-day. Rum idea this is, that <b>tidiness</b> is a timid, quiet sort of thing; why, <b>tidiness</b> is a toil for giants. You can't tidy anything without untidying yourself; just look at my trousers. Don't you know that? Haven't {{you ever had a}} spring cleaning?" ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{evening before}} all the wounds were dressed, and it was dark night ere the {{disorder}} caused by the action and its consequences were removed, and the gun-boat restored to somewhat of its wonted <b>tidiness</b> and appearance of comfort.

60|$|Vanity was an {{extremely}} traceable spring of action. When nurse went, Miss Lucilla gave the household no peace, because no one could rightly curl the long flaxen tresses upon her shoulders, until the worry became so intolerable that Honora, partly as penance, partly because she thought the present mode neither conducive to <b>tidiness</b> nor comfort, took her scissors and trimmed all the ringlets behind, bowl-dish fashion, as her own carrots had figured all the days of her childhood.|$|E

Wery good little dinner, sir, they can get ready in half an hour--pair of fowls, sir, and a weal cutlet; French beans, 'taturs, tart, and <b>tidiness.</b> You'd better stop vere you are, sir, if I might recommend.

60|$|Madame Desprez was {{an artist}} in the kitchen, and made coffee to a nicety. She had a knack of <b>tidiness,</b> with which she had {{infected}} the Doctor; everything was in its place; everything capable of polish shone gloriously; and dust was a thing banished from her empire. Aline, their single servant, had no other business {{in the world but}} to scour and burnish. So Doctor Desprez lived in his house like a fatted calf, warmed and cosseted to his heart's content.|$|E
60|$|The {{room behind}} the arch was shady. A little cool breeze shook the curtain and one smelt heliotrope. Kit noted the smooth {{polished}} floor, the even rows of black boxes, and the neatly-sorted documents {{on the big}} writing table. <b>Tidiness</b> is not the rule in Spain, but all was neat where Betty was about. Betty herself wore a plain white dress, and Kit thought she looked cool and businesslike. Turning her revolving chair, she gave him her hand with a friendly smile.|$|E
60|$|She got out her box {{of paper}} and sat down by the little table at the window with a small {{kerosene}} lamp at her elbow. The room was small--a mere box above the kitchen which Sidney shared with two small cousins. Her bed and the cot where the little girls slept filled up almost all the available space. The furniture was poor, but everything was neat--it was the only neat room in the house, indeed, for <b>tidiness</b> was no besetting virtue of Aunt Jane's.|$|E
60|$|Marguerite's {{first and}} most natural {{instinct}} had, of course, been one of dislike and mistrust of anyone {{who appeared to be}} in some way on guard over her. But when she took in every detail of the quaint figure of the old man, his scrupulous <b>tidiness</b> of apparel, the resigned stoop of his shoulders, and met in full the gaze of those moist eyes, she felt that the whole aspect of the man, as he sat there polishing his shoes, was infinitely pathetic and, in its simplicity, commanding of respect.|$|E
6000|$|As {{time went}} on Nelly Hardy grew {{altogether}} out of her old self. Sometimes, indeed, bursts of temper, such as those which had gained her {{the name of the}} [...] "Wild Cat," [...] would flare out, but these were very rare now. She was still very poorly dressed, for her house was as wretched as of old, but there was an attempt at <b>tidiness.</b> Her manner, too, was softer, and it became more and more quiet as things went on, and her playmates wondered again and again what had come over Nell Hardy; she had got to be as quiet as a mouse.|$|E
6000|$|The failing woman reaped now {{the benefit}} of Polly's training. Her gentle, quiet way, her soft voice, her {{neatness}} and <b>tidiness,</b> made her an excellent nurse, and she devoted herself to cheer and brighten the sickroom {{of the woman who}} had made so kind an adopted mother to her. Her influence kept even the rough boys quiet; and all Varley, which had at first been unanimous in its condemnation of the manner in which Luke Marner was bringing up that [...] "gal" [...] of his, just as if the place was not good enough for her, were now forced to confess that the experiment had turned out well.|$|E
60|$|The {{first is}} a little log-hut embosomed in bushes, with a stately tree rising close beside it. Flowers and berries bedeck the {{surrounding}} shrubbery, pleasant perfumes fill the air. A small garden, in which the useful and ornamental are blended, environs the hut. The two windows are filled with glass, not parchment. A rustic porch, covered with twining plants, conceals the door, and a general air of <b>tidiness</b> marks all the surroundings. Need we say more to convince the intelligent reader {{that this is the}} hut of old Liz? It occupies the spot where it was deposited by the flood, the family having been allowed to remain there.|$|E
6000|$|... "As to {{the second}} corridor," [...] he went on. [...] "There having been nothing in it, last year, but {{the doors of the}} rooms (to every one of which I can swear, if necessary), my mind is easy, I admit, {{respecting}} that part of the house only. But, as to Mr. Franklin's bedroom (if THAT is to be put back to what it was before), I want to know who is responsible for keeping it in a perpetual state of litter, no matter how often it may be set right--his trousers here, his towels there, and his French novels everywhere. I say, who is responsible for untidying the <b>tidiness</b> of Mr. Franklin's room, him or me?" ...|$|E
60|$|Syme strolled {{with her}} to {{a seat in the}} corner of the garden, and {{continued}} to pour out his opinions. For he was a sincere man, and in spite of his superficial airs and graces, at root a humble one. And it is always the humble man who talks too much; the proud man watches himself too closely. He defended respectability with violence and exaggeration. He grew passionate in his praise of <b>tidiness</b> and propriety. All the time there was a smell of lilac all round him. Once he heard very faintly in some distant street a barrel-organ begin to play, and it seemed to him that his heroic words were moving to a tiny tune from under or beyond the world.|$|E
60|$|They {{found her}} well and happy. Monsieur Martin's house {{was in the}} suburbs of Nantes. It had a large garden, at the end of which, facing another street, stood a pretty little house that had been {{generally}} used, either as the abode of aged mothers or unmarried sisters of the family, or for an eldest son to take his wife to; but which had now been handed over to Jean and his wife. This was very pleasant for Patsey, as it united the privacy of a separate abode with the cheerfulness of the family home. She had her own servant, whose excellent cooking and, above all, whose scrupulous cleanliness and <b>tidiness,</b> astonished her after the rough meals and haphazard arrangements at Netherstock.|$|E
60|$|The {{apartment}} had no look of desertion. His wife's <b>tidiness</b> {{was one of}} {{the traits}} which had so much pleased him; his own upbringing had given him a tender sympathy for the delight in orderliness; and when he had seen her instinctive desire to put each thing in its appointed place it had given him a little warm feeling in his heart. The bedroom looked as though she had just left it: the brushes were neatly placed on the toilet-table, one {{on each side of the}} comb; someone had smoothed down the bed on which she had spent her last night in the studio; and her nightdress in a little case lay on the pillow. It was impossible to believe that she would never come into that room again.|$|E
60|$|She {{had fallen}} {{away from her}} {{resolution}} to her dreams for a time, when suddenly she jumped up and began her work with immense energy. Open went one box after another, and in five minutes the room was strewed with her possessions. The modest set of drawers which was to supply all her wants was filled with immediate haste. Things were deposited in whatever nooks might be found, and every corner was utilized. Her character for <b>tidiness</b> had never stood high. At the bijou Lucy, or her mother, or the favourite maid, had always been at hand to make good her deficiencies with a reproach which had never gone beyond a smile or a kiss. At Glenbogie and even on the journey there had been attendant lady's maids. But here she was all alone.|$|E
60|$|The repairs of {{the little}} vessel were nearly completed. It was a breezy, cheerful day; the land was bright, the water was blue, the quick waves leaped crisply in the sunshine, the men were singing at their work. Descending to the cabin, Midwinter {{discovered}} his friend busily occupied in attempting to set the place to rights. Habitually the least systematic of mortals, Allan now and then awoke to an overwhelming sense {{of the advantages of}} order, and on such occasions a perfect frenzy of <b>tidiness</b> possessed him. He was down on his knees, hotly and wildly at work, when Midwinter looked in on him; and was fast reducing the neat little world of the cabin to its original elements of chaos, with a misdirected energy wonderful to see.|$|E
60|$|Curly {{entered the}} saloon. And {{now in the}} light it could be {{perceived}} that he bore the stamp of many years of vagabondage. He had none of the <b>tidiness</b> of the calculating and shrewd professional tramp. His wardrobe represented the cast-off specimens {{of half a dozen}} fashions and eras. Two factories had combined their efforts in providing shoes for his feet. As you gazed at him there passed through your mind vague impressions of mummies, wax figures, Russian exiles, and men lost on desert islands. His face was covered almost to his eyes with a curly brown beard that he kept trimmed short with a pocket-knife, and that had furnished him with his /nom de route/. Light-blue eyes, full of sullenness, fear, cunning, impudence, and fawning, witnessed the stress that had been laid upon his soul.|$|E
60|$|It lasted {{till the}} return of the walking party, so late, that they had been star-gazing, and came in, in full dispute as to which was Cygnus and which Aquila, while Blanche was talking very grandly of Taurus Poniatouski, and Harry begging to be told which constellations he should still see in the {{southern}} hemisphere. Dr. May was the first to rectify the globe for the southern latitudes, and fingers were affectionately laid on Orion's studded belt, as though he were a friend who would accompany the sailor-boy. Voices grew loud and eager in enumerating the stars common to both; and so came bedtime, and the globe stood on the table in danger of being forgotten. Ethel diligently lifted it up; and while Norman exclaimed at her <b>tidiness,</b> Margaret told how a new leaf was to be turned, and of her voluntary forfeits.|$|E
6000|$|From these Sophy gained no information, and it {{was some}} little time, indeed, before she did so; but one day, {{rendered}} careless by the <b>tidiness</b> and care of his servant, Father Eustace went out, leaving his {{key in the lock}} of his desk. It was for this that Sophy had been waiting and hoping. She lost not a moment in taking it out, and taking an impression of it on a flat cake of wax, which she had carried ready in her pocket from the day she had entered his service. The same afternoon she sent the cake of wax, in a small tin box, to Mr. Billow, King Edward Street, Lambeth, enclosed in a letter with a £5 note, requesting a key to be made from the impression, and sent down at once to the direction, [...] "Mary Westwood, Post Office, Sturry, Kent." ...|$|E
