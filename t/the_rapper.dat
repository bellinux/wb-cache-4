5|$|The 1996 title PaRappa <b>the</b> <b>Rapper</b> {{has been}} deemed the first {{influential}} rhythm game, whose basic template formed {{the core of}} subsequent games in the genre. In 1997, Konami's Beatmania sparked an emergent market for rhythm games in Japan. The company's music division, Bemani, released a series of music-based games {{over the next several}} years. The most successful of these was the 1998 dance mat game Dance Dance Revolution, which was the only Bemani title to achieve large-scale success outside Japan, and would see numerous imitations of the game from other publishers.|$|E
5|$|The Slim Shady LP turned Eminem from an {{underground}} rapper into a high-profile celebrity. Interscope Records awarded {{him with his}} own record label, Shady Records, and he embarked on an extensive touring schedule to promote the album. In the summer of 1999, <b>the</b> <b>rapper</b> frequently performed on the Vans Warped Tour and in hip-hop clubs. He also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on American youth.|$|E

5|$|While {{recording}} Doggystyle with Dr. Dre in August 1993, Snoop Dogg {{was arrested}} {{in connection with the}} death of Phillip Woldermarian, a member of a rival gang who was shot and killed in a gang fight. According to the charges, the rapper's bodyguard, McKinley Lee, shot Woldermarian as Snoop Dogg drove the vehicle; <b>the</b> <b>rapper</b> claimed it was self-defense, alleging the victim was stalking him. He spent most of 1995 preparing the case which went to trial in late-1995. He was cleared of all charges in February 1996 when he began working on his second album, Tha Doggfather.|$|E
5|$|Athens' local country {{scene has}} never been as {{significant}} as the profusion of indie rock bands; however, modern Athens rock takes many elements from the folk, bluegrass and country traditions, including such bands as the Normaltown Flyers.

Recent bands such as The Broken String Band have emerged influenced by the folk rock genre. <b>The</b> <b>rapper</b> Bubba Sparxxx, originally from South Georgia, has also helped diversify Athens' country heritage, by adding a rural image and elements of country music to his Dirty South style of hip hop music.|$|E
5|$|Harmonix {{was formed}} in 1995 from a {{computer}} music group at MIT. Beginning in 1998, the company developed music games inspired by PaRappa <b>the</b> <b>Rapper.</b> In 2001, the company released Frequency, which puts the player in control of multiple instrument tracks. Ryan Davis of GameSpot wrote that the game provides {{a greater sense of}} creative freedom than earlier rhythm titles. Frequency was critically acclaimed; however, marketing was made difficult by the game's abstract style, which removed the player's ability to perform for onlookers. In 2003, Harmonix followed up Frequency with the similar Amplitude. The company later released more socially driven, karaoke-themed music games in Karaoke Revolution and SingStar (2003 and 2004, respectively). Donkey Konga, a GameCube title developed by Namco and released in 2003, achieved widespread success by leveraging Nintendo's Donkey Kong brand.|$|E
5000|$|A jail bus arrives to take <b>the</b> white <b>rappers</b> to meet hip hop pioneers such as Fabel, {{from the}} Zulu Nation, and Kurtis Blow, {{one of the}} first {{mainstream}} rap artists. <b>The</b> <b>rappers</b> are offered <b>the</b> opportunity to dance, but only Jus Rhyme, G-Child, and Sullee dance; while none necessarily excels at their breakdance attempts, all of <b>the</b> <b>rappers</b> feel that Jus Rhyme did particularly bad, with one rapper noting he [...] "looked like he was trying to dance bad on purpose." [...] After they meet Fabel and Kurtis Blow, <b>the</b> <b>rappers</b> are brought to a church, where they are tested on their rap trivia knowledge, in a [...] "Name That Tune" [...] style competition called [...] "U Betta Recognize."

5|$|Human Entertainment's Dance Aerobics was {{an early}} rhythm-based video game {{released}} in 1987, and allows players to create music by stepping on Nintendo's Power Pad peripheral for the NES video game console. The 1996 title PaRappa <b>the</b> <b>Rapper</b> has been credited as the first true rhythm game, and {{as one of the}} first music-based games in general. It requires players to press buttons in the order that they appear on the screen, a basic mechanic that formed the core of future rhythm games. The success of PaRappa <b>the</b> <b>Rapper</b> sparked the popularity of the music game genre. In 1997, Konami released the DJ-themed rhythm game Beatmania in Japanese arcades. Its arcade cabinet features buttons similar to those of a musical keyboard, and a rubber pad that emulates a vinyl record. Beatmania was a surprise hit, inspiring Konami's Games and Music Division to change its name to Bemani in honor of the game, and to begin experimenting with other rhythm game concepts. Its successes include GuitarFreaks, which features a guitar-shaped controller, and 1998's Pop'n Music, a game similar to Beatmania in which multiple colorful buttons must be pressed. While the GuitarFreaks franchise continues to receive new arcade releases in Japan, it was never strongly marketed outside of the country. This allowed Red Octane and Harmonix to capitalize on the formula in 2005 with the Western-targeted Guitar Hero. In general, few Japanese arcade rhythm games were exported abroad because of the cost of producing the peripherals and the resulting increases in retail prices. The 1999 Bemani title DrumMania featured a drum kit controller, and could be linked with GuitarFreaks for simulated jam sessions. Similarly, this concept was later appropriated by Harmonix for their game Rock Band.|$|E
5|$|Paper Mario was {{developed}} by Intelligent Systems. Kumiko Takeda and Kaori Aoki wrote the game's script, while Naohiko Aoyama was the art director responsible for the game's distinctive graphical style. The game was initially called Super Mario RPG 2, and was first revealed at Nintendo Space World '97, a former video game trade show hosted by Nintendo. Critics compared the game's 2D character style to PaRappa <b>the</b> <b>Rapper.</b> Shigeru Miyamoto, who consulted on the project, stated that the game was being developed with amateur gamers in mind. He had earlier revealed at E3 that around twenty developers were actively involved with the project. Paper Mario was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in 2007, and the Wii U Virtual Console in 2015. The game was also released for the iQue Player in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{developed}} {{as a vehicle for}} Eve under the working title The Opposite Sex; UPN executives approached <b>the</b> <b>rapper</b> about a television project after the success of fellow musician Brandy in another of the network's sitcoms—Moesha. Eve's series was created as part of the network's attempt to appeal to a younger audience. After being picked up, the show was renamed Eve to attract the rapper's fans. The series was set in Miami, but filmed at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Eve said that she was intimidated at first by the process of preparing for and filming a sitcom, and she would later regret not fully committing to her character. The show was distributed by UPN in its original run, and later by TV One. UPN had promoted Eve as part of its new comedy block, one of four new comedies developed by the network.|$|E

50|$|Essentially, {{the high}} energy {{repeated}} motion created by <b>the</b> <b>rappers</b> is <b>the</b> {{source of their}} wear. The consistent high intensity vibrations cause fatigue and wear on <b>the</b> <b>rappers.</b> Bolted joints are especially affected by this repetitive motion and must be replaced. Frequent failure of air in inlet fittings is another issue that arises from the motion. Repeated vibrations cause fittings to dull down and pipe threads break off, therefore, loosening the fittings.|$|R
50|$|Rappers {{are used}} to {{transmit}} strong shearing forces to collecting plates in order to release deposited dust particles. Rapping is {{the process by which}} electrodes and particles are broken apart by vibrations from <b>the</b> <b>rappers.</b> Often used in electrostatic precipitators, <b>rappers</b> relapse <b>the</b> caked on dust layer which then descends into a hopper. Number, size, and frequency of <b>the</b> <b>rappers</b> vary from system to system based upon the specific characteristics of the dust being collected.|$|R
5|$|In 1992, {{the group}} {{performed}} at a music festival {{held by the}} Dakar French Cultural Center, where the French rapper MC Solaar heard their performance and invited the group to open {{for him when he}} debuted in Dakar in October of that year. <b>The</b> <b>rapper</b> was impressed with Positive Black Soul, inviting them to continue performing with him in France. Two years later the group put out its first release, a cassette entitled Boul Falé. The album was followed by more touring in France, as well as in England and Switzerland. In the same year, the Senegalese musician Baaba Maal offered PBS the opportunity to be on his album Firin' in Fouta. Maal was signed to Mango Records and because of this recording with him, Positive Black Soul were signed as well. They released their album debut Salaam on Mango Records. After achieving success in Senegal and some abroad, the group continued touring, including 130 performances in 1997. They also began organizing concerts in Dakar and promoting new groups including Daara J and Pee Froiss.|$|E
5|$|NanaOn-Sha, {{the creators}} of PaRappa <b>the</b> <b>Rapper,</b> {{released}} Vib-Ribbon in 1999. It eschews instrument-shaped controllers; instead, players maneuver the protagonist through an obstacle course by pressing buttons at correct times. The game's levels are generated by the background music, which players may change by inserting audio CDs. While it was praised for its unique style and artistry, Vib-Ribbons simple vector graphics proved difficult to market, and the game was never released in North America. Sega's Samba de Amigo, released in arcades in 1999 and on the Dreamcast in 2000, features maraca-shaped, motion sensitive controllers. The game allows for two-player gameplay, provides a spectacle for onlookers and allows players to socialise while gaming. In 2000, Taiko no Tatsujin combined traditional Japanese drums with contemporary pop music, and became highly successful in Japanese arcades. The game was later released on consoles in the West as Taiko Drum Master, and the franchise continues to receive new installments in Japan. Gitaroo Man featured a guitar-playing protagonist four years before the release of Guitar Hero, though the game employed a conventional rather than guitar-shaped controller. Gitaroo Mans creator, Keiichi Yano, later created Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, a rhythm game for the Nintendo DS that utilizes the handheld's touchscreen features. It became a highly demanded import title, {{which led to the}} release of an altered version of the game in the West—Elite Beat Agents—and a sequel in Japan.|$|E
