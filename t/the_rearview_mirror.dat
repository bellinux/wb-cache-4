[...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly liked the song, in which Allen makes fun of her own material-girl ID {{and went on to}} say that it is in fact [...] "a tale of two Lilys: the naughty postadolescent in <b>the</b> <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror,</b> and the fully realized female coming around the bend."

This vehicle was very popular with taxi drivers, {{but by the end of}} 1998 they had all fallen foul of the ten-year age rule on Argentine taxi vehicles.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 16) The potential glare from <b>rearview</b> <b>mirrors</b> was quantified in simulated encounters {{using data}} on the locations of mirrors and headlamps, and on the photometric output of low-beam headlamps. This was done for two classes of vehicles (passenger cars, and light trucks and vans [LTVs]) in {{the roles of the}} vehicle subject to the glare and the vehicle producing the glare. The results indicate that, in many encounters with glare vehicles to the rear, there will be a substantial disparity in glare, both among vehicles of different classes and among different mirror locations on a single vehicle. The main reason for this is the strong role of mirror height in determining how much a mirror is exposed to the lower, and therefore stronger, portion of a low-beam light pattern. There is substantially greater potential for high glare values on the mirrors of passenger cars versus LTVs. and on the driver-side <b>mirror</b> versus <b>the</b> center <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror</b> on all vehicles. With upward misaim of headlamps, these disparities are increased, as is the absolute level of potential glare. The relatively low potential for glare on the center mirrors of LTVs will often be compounded by the low transmittance of privacy glass on those vehicles. The present results have implications for where glare light should be sensed in order to control automatic anti-glare mirrors. However, specific recommendations should incorporate two additional considerations: (1) the geometry of a given vehicle, including the actual heights of <b>the</b> <b>rearview</b> <b>mirrors</b> and how <b>the</b> potential fields of view of those mirrors are affected by opaque parts of the vehicle, and (2) quantification of the exposure to glare that vehicles experience in actual traffic, including the frequencies at which glare vehicles are encountered in the fields of view of the individual mirrors...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of hydrophobic treatment on distance estimation under conditions of simulated rain and wind when applied to the driver-side window and driver-side exterior <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> dependent measure was the estimate of distance to a target vehicle viewed through the driver-side window and <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> following independent variables were examined: actual distance, hydrophobic treatment of the driver-side window, hydrophobic treatment of <b>the</b> driver-side exterior <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror,</b> participant age, and participant sex. While {{the results of this}} study indicate no significant effect of hydrophobically treating driver-side windows or mirrors, one marginally nonsignificant interaction of interest was observed. Specifically, there was a tendency for older drivers to report shorter (more conservative and presumably safer) distance estimates when viewing vehicles through a driverside window that has received hydrophobic treatment. This tendency, in combination with over-representation of older drivers in lane change/merge crashes, suggests that additional research efforts should be focused on examining the potential for safety benefits from applying hydrophobic treatment to driver-side windows...|$|R
