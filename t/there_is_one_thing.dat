Built around The Meters' funky beat-driven percussion, [...] "1 Thing" [...] finds Amerie lamenting an aspect of a relationship that keeps her satisfied. Even if other factors are less than positive, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that keeps her hooked ("It's this one thing that's got me trippin'"). Amerie said that {{the inspiration for the}} song came from a conversation she had with Harrison [...] "about relationships and how there's always one thing that keeps you attracted to someone. No matter what they do or how they act, there's that one undeniable thing that keeps you coming back." [...] She told Blender that the [...] "one thing" [...] "could be bringing flowers, or something more ... physical. People think I'm just this good girl, but there are other sides they don't see." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Crookshank, {{who had his}} jersey retired {{while playing}} for Halifax, said that the {{prospect}} of having the organization fold was [...] "sad." [...] He also said, [...] "If what these players are saying is true it’s very hurtful to me. It sickening to my stomach that the players say they didn't get paid or they got kicked out of their living arrangements." [...] Joey Haywood criticized the league for not having a players' union or commissioner, with [...] "owners acting like commissioners." [...] He also condemned Levingston for not standing up for his players. On May 7, Clarós issued an open letter to the City of Halifax and the fans of the Rainmen. In a paragraph about the forfeit, he wrote, [...] "At this time, we don't know what the future holds. But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> we know for sure. That when a group of good people unite to take a stand in the name of safety, good values, people’s rights and strong principles, that this will rise above any rules or even winning." ...|$|E
500|$|Isherwood {{also notes}} that this serves a female audience. [...] "If there are chick flicks and chick lit – {{derogatory}} though some might find those terms to be – Love, Loss, and What I Wore should clearly be classified as chick legit...for the women who can share deeply in the particulars of experience dissected and discussed." [...] The Los Angeles Times notes the light nature of the subject matter: [...] "...isn't out to reclaim female sexuality from centuries of oppression; it wittily celebrates wardrobe malfunctions..." [...] According to Reiner, the show points out that [...] "...if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> the females of the species have in common, it's a deep and abiding love/hate relationship with their wardrobe...this wonderfully witty show illustrates, what one wears to the party is sometimes more memorable than the party itself." [...] He {{also notes that}} the entire performance has meaning as it is [...] "jam-packed and resonant" [...] throughout. Shaw notes that [...] "The cozy humor strikes many women's funny bones with a mighty whack, perhaps because it reaffirms so perfectly their own preoccupations." ...|$|E

2500|$|C. H. Wheeler {{recorded}} that {{he played}} cricket into his eighties and added that:...he {{was prepared to}} back himself against any man in England ... in five manly sports - cricket, shooting, running, jumping and sparring. Though his celebrity was more especially {{for the first of}} the five, I have heard him say, [...] "If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I can do better than another, it is the last-named." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boulanger's unrelenting {{schedule}} of teaching, performing, composing, writing letters etc. {{started to take}} its toll on her health; she had frequent migraines and toothaches. She stopped writing as a critic for Le Monde musical as she could not attend the requisite concerts. To maintain the living standard {{for her and her}} mother, she concentrated on teaching. This was her most lucrative source of income. Fauré believed she was mistaken to stop composing, but she told him, [...] "If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> of which I am certain, it is that I wrote useless music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Twain was a Presbyterian. He was {{critical}} of organized religion and certain elements of Christianity through his later life. He wrote, for example, [...] "Faith is believing what you know ain't so", and [...] "If Christ were here now <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> he would not be– a Christian". With anti-Catholic sentiment rampant in 19th century America, Twain noted he was “educated to enmity toward everything that is Catholic”. As an adult, he engaged in religious discussions and attended services, his theology developing as he wrestled with the deaths of loved ones and with his own mortality.|$|E

2500|$|... "As {{chairman}} of the Committee on Constitution he more than likely authored the amendment to the Party's Article II, Section 6, which provided for the expulsion from the Party of 'any member of the party who opposes political action or advocates crime, sabotage, or other methods of violence as a weapon {{of the working class}} to aid in its emancipation...'" [...] He voiced his justification for the anti-sabotage amendment by reassuring the convention that 'if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> in this country that can now check or disrupt the Socialist movement, it is not the capitalist class; it is not the Catholic Church; it is our own injudicious friends from within.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|His work on Autoemancipation was pre-figured by {{a similar}} {{conclusion}} drawn by Marx's friend Moses Hess, in Rome and Jerusalem (1862). [...] Pinkser had never yet read it, but {{was aware of}} the distant and far off Hibbat Zion. [...] Herzl's philosophical instruction highlighted the weaknesses and vulnerabilities. [...] To Herzl each dictator or leader had a nationalistic identity, even down to the Irish from Wolfe Tone onwards. [...] He was drawn to the mawkishness of Judaism rendered distinctively as German. [...] But he remained convinced that Germany was the centre (Hauptsitz) of antisemitism rather than France. [...] In a much quoted aside he noted [...] "If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I should like to be, it is a member of old Prussian nobility". Herzl appealed to the nobility of Jewish England - the Rothschilds, Sir Samuel Montagu, later cabinet minister, to the Chief Rabbis of France and Vienna, the railroad magnate, Baron Hirsch.|$|E
2500|$|Gould also {{addressed}} the issue of selfish genes in his essay [...] "Caring groups and selfish genes". Gould acknowledged that Dawkins was not imputing conscious action to genes, but simply using a shorthand metaphor commonly found in evolutionary writings. To Gould, the fatal flaw was that [...] "no matter how much power Dawkins wishes to assign to genes, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that he cannot give them – direct visibility to natural selection." [...] Rather, the unit of selection is the phenotype, not the genotype, because it is phenotypes that interact with the environment at the natural-selection interface. So, in Kim Sterelny's summation of Gould's view, [...] "gene differences do not cause evolutionary changes in populations, they register those changes." [...] Richard Dawkins replied to this criticism in a later book, The Extended Phenotype, that Gould confused particulate genetics with particulate embryology, stating that genes do [...] "blend", as far as their effects on developing phenotypes are concerned, but that they do not blend as they replicate and recombine down the generations.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{response}} to some early negative reactions to the actress' performance, Jon Lachonis noted {{in a review of}} the first season's seventh episode that [...] "Anna Torv, whose chill portrayal of FBI agent and Pattern investigator Olivia Dunham has come under fire for being too wooden, seems to have reinvented her character to answer the critics. The good news is, Anna's new and more animated Olivia isn't really a departure so much as it is a character who seems to have had a catharsis. She is comfortable in her skin now, and the stillness is pulled back in favor of more humanity. Of course, it is helpful that she reunites with an old beau in this episode - if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> Fringe is totally lacking it is sexual tension." [...] Executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman defended Torv's early Fringe work in a 2011 interview, explaining the character was designed to be [...] "bland, because of her conditioning as a child and everything she's been through. Now, one can argue that maybe that wasn't the best way for us to introduce the main character, but there was a purpose. So Anna had to listen to all these people saying 'She's really doing nothing,' when really it was our issue. We didn't write anything for her because... well, now you know why. But at the time, people were like, 'Wow, this girl really is not much,' which is so not true. Anna was just so professional, and so great. She did it with excellence, and now she's really getting the chance to show people, 'Hey, I'm a really hard worker and a terrific actor.' We're so thankful that people can start to see her for who she really is. Midway through the second season, Sarah Stegall from SFScope believed Torv [...] "had the most progress and the most satisfying development" [...] of all the main actors, stating she [...] "is now carrying this role with grace and strength". Stegall partly attributed the growth of the actor and character to her recovery early in the second season, the introduction of a sister and niece, the removal of John Scott from her storyline, and the [...] "delicate, reserved flirtation" [...] with Peter.|$|E
