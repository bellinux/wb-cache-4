5|$|The {{difference}} of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement {{for the establishment of}} an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order. The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. <b>They</b> <b>insist</b> that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.|$|E
5|$|The CCP {{views the}} world as {{organized}} into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. <b>They</b> <b>insist</b> that socialism, {{on the basis of}} historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Despite admitting that globalization developed through the capitalist system, the party's leaders and theorist argue that globalization is not intrinsically capitalist. The reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist, it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity. Globalization, as with the market economy, therefore does not have one specific class character (neither socialist nor capitalist) according to the party. The insistence that globalization is not fixed in nature comes from Deng's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CCP that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization, globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism.|$|E
25|$|Strangites reject {{both the}} {{traditional}} Christian {{doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus Christ and the Mormon doctrine of plurality of gods. <b>They</b> <b>insist</b> that there is but one eternal God, the Father, and that alleged progression to godhood (a doctrine supposedly taught by Smith; Strangites reject that assertion) is impossible. God has always been God, say they, and he is one Person (not three, as in the traditional Christian Trinity).|$|E

25|$|However, some researchers, such as ecology {{professor}} Tim Clutton-Brock, {{assert that}} cooperation {{is a more}} complex process. They state that helpers may receive more direct, and less indirect, gains from assisting others than is commonly reported. These gains include protection from predation and increased reproductive fitness. Furthermore, <b>they</b> <b>insist</b> that cooperation may not solely be an interaction between two individuals but {{may be part of}} the broader goal of unifying populations.|$|E
25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) outlawed {{the use of}} {{fluorescein}} {{for this}} purpose, since it was shown to be harmful to the river. The parade committee has since switched to a mix involving forty pounds of powdered vegetable dye. Though the committee closely guards the exact formula, <b>they</b> <b>insist</b> {{that it has been}} tested and verified safe for the environment. Furthermore, since the environmental organization Friends of the Chicago River believes the dye is probably not harmful, they do not oppose the practice.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{largely due}} to the efforts of the National Coalition for the Homeless (NCH) and {{academic}} researchers, the problem of violence against homeless people has gained national attention. In their report: Hate, Violence, and Death on Mainstreet USA, the NCH reported 386 violent acts committed against homeless persons over the period, among which 155 were lethal. The NCH called those acts hate crimes (they retain the definition of the American Congress). <b>They</b> <b>insist</b> that so called bumfight videos disseminate hate against homeless people and dehumanize them.|$|E

25|$|A {{friend and}} romantic interest, Joanne Herring, {{encourages}} Charlie {{to do more}} to help the Afghan people, and persuades Charlie to visit the Pakistani leadership. The Pakistanis complain about the inadequate support of the U.S. to oppose the Soviet Union, and <b>they</b> <b>insist</b> that Charlie visit a major Pakistan-based Afghan refugee camp. Charlie is deeply moved by their misery and determination to fight, but is frustrated by the regional CIA personnel's insistence on a low key approach against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Charlie returns home to lead an effort to substantially increase funding to the mujahideen.|$|E
25|$|Daniel and Marty inform Khrone {{that they}} have no further need of his Baron Harkonnen and Paul Atreides gholas. <b>They</b> <b>insist</b> they have lured the Ithaca into a trap, and will soon have the Kwisatz Haderach they have {{calculated}} is on board. Khrone, however, continues to prepare the gholas. He finally manages to restore the Baron's memories, and instructs him to train the Paul ghola (named Paolo), who does not yet have his memories. To the Baron's disquiet, he finds the mocking voice of his granddaughter Alia in his thoughts soon after recovering his memories. She also later threatens him should he try to harm Paolo.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of Areala {{has its roots}} in the , or the Fraternity of Our Lady, a traditionalist Catholic organization. In 1991, a chapter was established in New York City's East Harlem in order to found a soup kitchen. It was in New York that Sister Marie Chantel who had been a black belt in Judo learned Taekwondo under a Hell's Kitchen martial arts master. Her fellow nuns, including the Mother Superior, also learned self-defense hearing that the neighborhoods were dangerous, though <b>they</b> <b>insist</b> that their martial arts training is mostly for sport and that they have had no problems with the surrounding neighborhoods. Their story was ultimately picked up and reported by The New York Times.|$|E

25|$|However, some Hindus {{believe that}} when the emanations of the Supreme Being are pratyaksha, or obvious to the sight, they become sacara, or embodied. Krishna was such an {{embodiment}} and usually bore a human form. In that mode of appearance the deities are generally supposed to be born of a woman, but without any carnal intercourse. This belief is not adhered to by those who follow the Purva Mimansa, or the philosophy of Jaimini. <b>They</b> <b>insist</b> that the Devas were mere mortals whom the Supreme Being endowed with qualities similar to his own. In general, the Hindus perform acts of worship to some of their ancient monarchs and sages, who were deified on account of their eminent virtues.|$|E
25|$|According to Michael Lynk, {{there are}} three schools of thought {{concerning}} the proper legal interpretation of the withdrawal phrase. Some of the parties involved {{have suggested that the}} indefinite language is a “perceptible loophole”, that authorizes “territorial revision” for Israel’s benefit. Some have stated that the indefinite language was used to permit insubstantial and mutually beneficial alterations to the 1949 armistices lines, but that unilateral annexation of the captured territory was never authorized. Other parties have said that no final settlement obtained through force or the threat of force could be considered valid. <b>They</b> <b>insist</b> that the Security Council cannot create loopholes in peremptory norms of international law or the UN Charter, and that any use of indefinite language has to be interpreted in line with the overriding legal principles regarding the “inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war” and the prohibitions on mass deportations or displacement in connection with the settlement of the refugee problem.|$|E
25|$|Sovereigntists are {{moderate}} nationalists who do {{not believe}} Canada to be reformable {{in a way that}} could answer {{what they see as the}} legitimate wish of Quebecers to govern themselves freely. They opt for the independence of Quebec; however, at the same time <b>they</b> <b>insist</b> on offering an economic and political partnership to the rest of Canada on the basis of the equality of both nations. The political parties created by the sovereigntists created are the Bloc Québécois and the Parti Québécois, which its members define as a party of social democratic tendency. The Parti Québécois organized a 1980 referendum and a 1995 referendum, each of which could have led to negotiations for independence had it succeeded. The No side prevailed in both, but its margin was very narrow in the second referendum (50.6% No, 49.4% Yes). Sovereigntists find their ideological origins in the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association, René Lévesque's short-lived precursor to the Parti Québécois.|$|E

25|$|The CPC don't {{believe that}} they have {{abandoned}} Marxism. The party views the world as organized into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. <b>They</b> <b>insist</b> that socialism, on the basis of historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Marx wrote that capitalists, in their search for profit, would travel the world in a bid to establish new international markets – hence, it is generally assumed that Marx forecasted globalization. His writings on the subject is used to justify the CPC's market reforms, since nations, according to Marx, have little choice in the matter of joining or not. Opting not to take part in capitalist globalization means losing out in the fields of economic development, technological development, foreign investment and world trade. This view is strengthened by the economic failures of the Soviet Union and of China under Mao.|$|E
25|$|Proposition Joe hosts {{a meeting}} with the heads of the New Day Co-Op {{consortium}} of drug dealers. He is in an awkward position, having had an entire shipment of narcotics stolen by Omar. He tries to convince his colleagues that they should pay for a replacement shipment while they work on recovering the stolen drugs. The rest of the Co-Op members are dubious and tell Joe that as the drugs were in the possession of his people when they were stolen, he will have {{to make up for the}} loss. Joe threatens to cut them off from his supplier in the future if <b>they</b> <b>insist</b> on this course and this quiets their protests. Marlo Stanfield quizzes Joe about which of his people was there when the shipment was taken. Joe admits that it was his nephew Cheese but tells Marlo that he will protect Cheese from any retribution. He offers to put Marlo in touch with his connection so he can reassure him that Cheese did not steal the drugs for himself.|$|E

[...] Even though there are publications associated with the movement, particularly by Zakariya Kandahalwi, the emphasis has never been on book learning, but rather on first-hand personal communication. A collection of books, usually referred as TablighiNisaab (Tablighi Curriculum), is recommended by Tabligh Jamaat elders for general reading. This set includes four books namely (Hayatus Sahabah, Fazail-e-Amaal, Fazail-e-Sadqaat and Muntakhab Ahadith).|$|E
500|$|The {{clothing}} line, 'Tattered and Torn', {{was launched}} by the band Slipknot in 2008 and runs as an imprint of Bravado, a company that runs the band's merchandising.

Vocalist Corey Taylor said, [...] "It's a way for [...] to get cool clothing at affordable prices." [...] The first items from the clothing line went on sale in late July 2008 through Hot Topic stores across North America and the Hot Topic website. Currently the line is limited to shirts and hoodies but was expected to develop into a full-range clothing line.|$|E

They accepted that the pre-1956 history of the Priory of Sion was a hoax created by Plantard, and that his claim that he was a Merovingian dynast was a lie. However, <b>they</b> <b>insist</b> that this was part of a complex red herring intended to distract the public from the hidden agenda of Plantard and his [...] "controllers". They argue that the Priory of Sion was a front organisation for one of the many crypto-political societies which have been plotting to create a [...] "United States of Europe" [...] in line with French occultist Alexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre's synarchist vision of an ideal form of government.|$|E
