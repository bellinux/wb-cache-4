2500|$|After {{the first}} ant has immobilized the prey, it {{releases}} pheromones to call other ants to the area. The first few ants to arrive will each grab a different leg and pull in opposite directions, [...] "spread-eagling" [...] the prey. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>basically</b> {{identical to the}} medieval torture tactic of [...] "rack torture". Anywhere between six and 16 ants will participate in this spread-eagling. As the prey lies motionless and helpless, worker ants will congregate and either help to hold the prey down, if that is necessary, or start stinging and biting it. In doing this, they use a venom that they produce to paralyze and kill the prey. Afterwards, the group of workers will carry the body back to the colony, where it is dismembered and cut up into little pieces to be eaten by the group.|$|E
2500|$|First, {{the image}} should be {{converted}} from RGB {{into a different}} color space called [...] (or, informally, YCbCr). It has three components Y', CB and CR: the Y' component represents the brightness of a pixel, and the CB and CR components represent the chrominance (split into blue and red components). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>basically</b> the same color space as used by digital color television as well as digital video including video DVDs, and {{is similar to the}} way color is represented in analog PAL video and MAC (but not by analog NTSC, which uses the YIQ color space). The [...] color space conversion allows greater compression without a significant effect on perceptual image quality (or greater perceptual image quality for the same compression). The compression is more efficient because the brightness information, which is more important to the eventual perceptual quality of the image, is confined to a single channel. This more closely corresponds to the perception of color in the human visual system. The color transformation also improves compression by statistical decorrelation.|$|E

2500|$|In {{television}} stations, recording studios, {{and other}} installations where signal quality is critical, a special signal ground {{known as a}} [...] "technical ground" [...] (or [...] "technical earth", [...] "special earth", and [...] "audio earth") is often installed, to prevent ground loops. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>basically</b> {{the same thing as}} an AC power ground, but no general appliance ground wires are allowed any connection to it, as they may carry electrical interference. For example, only audio equipment is connected to the technical ground in a recording studio. In most cases, the studio's metal equipment racks are all joined together with heavy copper cables (or flattened copper tubing or busbars) and similar connections are made to the technical ground. Great care is taken that no general chassis grounded appliances are placed on the racks, as a single AC ground connection to the technical ground will destroy its effectiveness. For particularly demanding applications, the main technical ground may consist of a heavy copper pipe, if necessary fitted by drilling through several concrete floors, such that all technical grounds may be connected by the shortest possible path to a grounding rod in the basement.|$|E
2500|$|Ringer was one {{of three}} MSU players to be invited to the NFL combine, along with QB Brian Hoyer and safety Otis Wiley. Ringer took part in Michigan State's 2009 NFL Pro Day at the Duffy Daugherty indoor facility. Ringer's shuttle time was 3.89, which was faster than the fastest time at the NFL combine. Ringer said of the workout, [...] "I think I did pretty well, {{especially}} coming back from my knee injury. I'm still not 100 percent, probably around 85 or 90. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>basically</b> another big stepping stone from what I did at the combine. Now that I was able to do some training, I felt like my change of direction was superb. I feel like I did really well in the shuttle and in the three-cone drill." [...] He participated in an MSU-sponsored podcast after the event discussing the event. Ringer improved his forty time from a 4.59 at the combine to a 4.42 during Pro Days. When asked about where he wants to get drafted, Ringer responded, [...] "I'll go anywhere. To get picked up somewhere will be a blessing." [...] Ringer's performance at Pro Day [...] "absolutely blew NFL teams away", due to putting up impressive numbers while not fully recovered. With his draft stock on the rise, Ringer has worked out with several NFL teams, including the Denver Broncos, the Tennessee Titans and the San Diego Chargers. He has also drawn interest from the Seattle Seahawks. He has since received workouts from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Buffalo Bills, and the New York Jets. A website that predicts him as a 3rd to 4th rounder also compares him to Priest Holmes. Ringer stated about his knee right before the draft, [...] "My leg feels fine. Right now, I'll give it between 90-95%." [...] One site calls Ringer a [...] "willing, if undersized, workhorse", but also questions his durability. When talking about draft day, Ringer responded [...] "I'm not nervous at all. I'm just kind of really mellow, calm ... knowing that whatever happens is going to happen, and whatever team I go to, that's the team where I'm meant to be." [...] Mel Kiper said of Ringer [...] "He's only 5-9, 205, but he's remarkably strong, a good athlete and just a tough kid with great character. He blocks extremely well, and he'll be a very serviceable No. 2 back. He'll probably end up being a fourth- or fifth-round pick." [...] Ringer spent time with his family in Dayton, Ohio, on April 25 watching the draft and celebrating his mother's birthday, waiting to get selected.|$|E
