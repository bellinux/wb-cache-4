5000|$|Multicore cables {{are used}} with {{professional}} video cameras. In television studios, 26-pin cables {{are used to}} connect [...] "cameras" [...] to camera control units (CCU). <b>Triaxial</b> <b>cables</b> are used primarily in outside broadcasting however both are capable of delivering an HD-SDI feed and 30 - 40 Watts of power for the Cameras.|$|R
50|$|Venues that host {{television}} productions fairly often, such {{as sports}} arenas, will usually have <b>triaxial</b> <b>cables</b> {{run from the}} location of the TV truck to common camera locations throughout the building. This is convenient for visiting television crews, who can simply plug into existing cable runs instead of having to run their own cables and remove them after filming.|$|R
50|$|Another {{application}} for <b>triaxial</b> <b>cables</b> is in taking precision low-current measurements where the leakage current through the insulator between {{the core and}} shield would normally alter the measurements. The core (known as the force) and the inner shield (known as the guard) are kept at approximately the same electrical potential by a voltage buffer/follower, thus the leakage current between them is zero for all practical purposes, despite the imperfections of the insulation. Instead, the leakage current occurs between {{the inner and outer}} shields, which does not matter since that current will be supplied by the buffer circuit rather than the device under test and will not affect measurements. This technique can provide almost perfect elimination of leakage current but becomes less effective at higher frequencies as the buffer cannot follow the measured voltage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Triaxial</b> <b>cable</b> or triax is {{coaxial cable}} {{with a third}} layer of shielding, {{insulation}} and sheathing. The outer shield, which is earthed (grounded), protects the inner shield from electromagnetic interference from outside sources.|$|E

50|$|<b>Triaxial</b> <b>cable,</b> often {{referred}} to as triax for short, is a type of electrical cable similar to coaxial cable, but with the addition of an extra layer of insulation and a second conducting sheath.

40|$|AbstractThe future {{electricity}} grid {{will be more}} sustainable and it will have more power transmission and distribution capability with more electrical power added from decentralized sources on distribution level and from wind parks and other large sources on transmission level. More interconnections and more underground transmission and distribution will be put up. Use of high temperature superconducting (HTS) power cables provides solutions {{to many of the}} future grid problems caused by these trends. In this paper we present an electrical model of a balanced 6 km-long three phase <b>triaxial</b> HTS power <b>cable</b> for the Dutch project being developed by a consortium of Alliander, Ultera™ and TUD. The cable currents in all three phases are balanced by selecting proper twist pitches and insulation thickness. The paper focuses on determining inductances, capacitances and AC losses of the balanced cable. Using the developed model, we also determine the voltage drop as function of the cable length, the neutral current and the effect of the imbalanced capacitances on the current distribution of the Dutch distribution cable.

50|$|<b>Triaxial</b> <b>cable</b> (triax) is {{a variant}} of coax with a second shield {{conductor}} surrounding the first {{with a layer of}} insulation in between. As well as providing additional shielding, the outer conductors can be used for other purposes such as providing power to equipment or control signals. Triax is widely used for the connection of cameras in television studios.|$|E
5000|$|Most picoammeters use a [...] "virtual short" [...] {{technique}} and have several different measurement ranges {{that must be}} switched between to cover multiple decades of measurement. Other modern picoammeters use log compression and a [...] "current sink" [...] method that eliminates range switching and associated voltage spikes. Special design and usage considerations must be observed {{in order to reduce}} leakage current which may swamp measurements such as special insulators and driven shields, <b>triaxial</b> <b>cable</b> is often used for probe connections.|$|E
50|$|Most {{television}} studio and professional video cameras have dedicated generator-locking ports on the camera. If {{the camera is}} tethered with a <b>triaxial</b> <b>cable</b> or optical fibre cable, the analog generator-locking signal is used to lock the camera control unit, which in turn locks the camera head by means of information carried within a data channel transmitted along the cable. If the camera is an ENG-type camera, one without a triax/fibre connection or without a dockable head, the generator-locking signal is carried through a separate cable from the video.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{accurate}} {{knowledge of}} the textural and electrochemical properties of clay suspensions is of great importance for many applications in soil and environmental chemistry involving the use of clay-rich porous media. These applications concern, for example, {{the understanding of the}} reactive transport properties of bentonites and argillites for the long-term prediction of the diffusivity of ionic species around radioactive waste repositories 1. Na-montmorillonite suspensions are characterized by an anisotropic surface charge distribution: a permanent high surface charge of their basal planes and a pH and salinity dependent surface charge of their edge planes. Current complex impedance measurements of charged suspensions are limited at low frequencies (typically < 1 kHz) by the electrochemical polarization of the current and potential electrodes and by the phase accuracy of the impedancemeter. A new four electrodes sample holder (separate current injection and potential electrodes, Fig. 1 a) and a very high accuracy impedancemeter 2 are proposed to improve the low-frequency complex impedance measurements of charged Na-montmorillonite suspensions. Low-frequency ([0. 1 Hz 45 kHz]) complex impedance measurements, at various clay volume fractions (0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, and 2 %), pH (5, 7, 9) and salinities (NaCl, from 10 - 4 to 5 x 10 - 2 mol L- 1), were done to elucidate the textural and electrochemical properties of Na-montmorillonite suspensions. Our results show that the electrochemical polarization of the electrical double layer around the Na-montmorillonite particles can also be observed at low frequency and high salinity (Fig. 2 a). Nevertheless, our measurements are also disturbed by the electromagnetic coupling due to the short <b>triaxial</b> <b>cables,</b> which connect the electrodes to the impedancemeter...|$|R
50|$|Male {{connector}} pins are often {{protected by a}} shell (also called a shroud, surround, or shield), which may envelop the entire female connector when mated. RF connectors often have multiple layers of interlocking shells to properly connect the shields of coaxial and <b>triaxial</b> <b>cable.</b> In such cases, the gender is assigned based on the innermost connecting point. With the exception of reverse polarity BNC or TNC, where the outer shell determines the gender and the innermost connecting points are opposite to a standard connector, for example a female RP-TNC connector has a solid innermost pin.|$|E

The impedance is 50 ohms + 5 ohms, a 50 ohm <b>Triaxial</b> <b>cable</b> is defined conductor is the signal, {{the other two are}} shields. MIL-C-17/134 cable is used for lengths up to 120 meters, MIL-C-17/135 is used for cable lengths up to 300 meters. The connectors are defined by MIL-C-49142 /01 and /02.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} {{is used in}} situations such as ECGs and precision low-current measurement where leakage current would otherwise swamp or alter the measurement. Any {{situation in which the}} source to be measured has a very high output impedance is vulnerable to leakage current and if sufficient insulation is not practical then a driven shield will improve performance. Coaxial cable is well suited for use as a guard, if electromagnetic shielding is also required then <b>triaxial</b> <b>cable</b> should be used as {{depending on the type of}} buffer circuit any noise on the guard may be amplified in the output.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} use of <b>triaxial</b> <b>cable</b> is in {{television}} {{industry as a}} connecting cable between a camera and its CCU. The outer sheath is commonly used as a protective earth conductor. The core provides both power and signal connections, with the return for the power being provided through the inner screen. Through frequency-division multiplexing, the camera can send audio and video signals along the triax while the CCU can send camera control information, such as exposure settings, intercom, return audio and video (usually that of the program), and tally (a signal alerting the operator that their camera is on the air)and power for the camera.|$|E
30|$|The single SiNW {{devices were}} {{electrically}} characterized at various temperature ranging from 100 to 300  K; the measurements were {{performed in a}} thermally controlled environment (Janis ST- 100 H cryostat) consisting of a cold finger column inserted in a vacuum chamber. The samples were mounted on the holder {{at the end of}} the cold finger, and a thin Kapton film (12.5  μm) was placed between the samples and the holder to ensure electrical insulation of the circuit while providing a good thermal contact. The vacuum chamber was connected to a scroll pump (Varian SH- 100) and to a turbo-molecular pump (Alcatel ATP 80), leading to a residual pressure around 10 − 5 mbar. The value of temperature was acquired with a platinum Pt- 100 resistor embedded into the cold finger, while a controller (Lake-Shore 331), coupled with a heater and a liquid nitrogen transfer-line, tuned the temperature to the set-point value. Kapton-covered cables inside the chamber provided electrical wiring of the samples to external coaxial plugs. We used a Keithley 6430 Sub-Femtoamp SourceMeter with remote preamplifier for electrical measurement; external noises were minimized using a short <b>triaxial</b> <b>cable</b> connected to the coaxial plugs of the cryostat through a specific adapter. The SourceMeter system provides three signal terminals, namely Hi and Low terminals for the electrical measurement and the Guard terminal for the guard ring circuit. The two main signals were connected to the probe pads of the single SiNW devices, while the guard terminal was bonded to the backside of the samples to avoid any current leakage in the substrate.|$|E
40|$|This {{innovation}} is a high-voltage, lowpower BNC (Bayonet Neill-Concelman) feedthrough {{that enables the}} user to terminate an instrumentation cable properly while connected to a high voltage, {{without the use of}} a voltage divider. This feedthrough is low power, which will not load the source, and will properly terminate the instrumentation cable to the instrumentation, even if the cable impedance is not constant. The Space Shuttle Program had a requirement to measure voltage transients on the orbiter bus through the Ground Lightning Measurement System (GLMS). This measurement has a bandwidth requirement of 1 MHz. The GLMS voltage measurement is connected to the orbiter through a DC panel. The DC panel is connected to the bus through a nonuniform cable that is approximately 75 ft (approximately equal to 23 m) long. A 15 -ft (approximately equal to 5 -m), 50 -ohm <b>triaxial</b> <b>cable</b> is connected between the DC panel and the digitizer. Based on calculations and simulations, cable resonances and reflections due to mismatched impedances of the cable connecting the orbiter bus and the digitizer causes the output not to reflect accurately what is on the bus. A voltage divider at the DC panel, and terminating the 50 -ohm cable properly, would eliminate this issue. Due to implementation issues, an alternative design was needed to terminate the cable properly without the use of a voltage divider. Analysis shows how the cable resonances and reflections due to the mismatched impedances of the cable connecting the orbiter bus and the digitizer causes the output not to reflect accurately what is on the bus. After simulating a dampening circuit located at the digitizer, simulations were performed to show how the cable resonances were dampened and the accuracy was improved significantly. Test cables built to verify simulations were accurate. Since the dampening circuit is low power, it can be packaged in a BNC feedthrough...|$|E
