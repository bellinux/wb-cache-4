40|$|The {{increased}} {{complexity of}} mobile networks, {{the need to}} deliver high data rate services and the variation of mobile traffic put a high burden on operation and maintenance in terms of extra workload and additional costs. New approaches to network optimization and management {{should be taken into}} account to increase network performance and reduce operational costs. Antenna tilt is a powerful parameter for optimization of a mobile network. It has direct impact on shaping the boundary of the serving cell and hence on the coverage and interference parameters of the network. With the introduction of Remote Electrical Tilt (RET) antennas, tilt optimization can be used in the context of self-optimization. This work discusses how base station antenna tilt {{can be used as a}} self-optimization tool for load-balancing and presents a framework for a self-optimization process that can be integrated into existing and future mobile networks. Tests using real traffic data proved that the self-optimization process can be used to correctly identify congested cells. Both link level and system level simulations are performed to determine the impact of <b>tilt</b> <b>adjustments</b> on network performance. The results show that antenna tilt can be an effective tool to achieve load-balance between neighbouring cells and thus increase the Grade of Service (GoS). Furthermore, different <b>tilt</b> <b>adjustment</b> procedures are discussed each with it's advantages and disadvantages. It is concluded that antenna tilt can be successfully used for self-optimization purposes and possible limitations and issues are discussed. Performance Evaluation of Antenna based SO...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The Stoer is {{the lowest}} of three groups {{comprising}} the Torridonian Supergroup, a clastic succession deposited late in Mesoproterozoic times on the (Lewisian) metamorphic foreland to the Caledonian Orogen in northwest Scotland. This study reports a palaeomagnetic, rock magnetic and magnetic fabric investigation through the full stratigraphic thickness of the succession. A primary magnetic fabric of sedimentary origin defines current flow from a westerly veering to northwesterly source. Rock magnetic studies identify the presence of both magnetite and hematite in these sediments. Magnetite is apparently of primary detrital origin whilst the hematite probably results mostly from early diagenesis {{in an environment of}} restricted chemical weathering. Palaeomagnetic study of sedimentary slumps shows that magnetic remanence post-dates deposition but was probably fixed by early dewatering and lithification because slumped blocks of Stoer in basal Torridon Group sediments preserve a primary remanence. <b>Tilt</b> <b>adjustment,</b> although inconclusive, also implies that magnetic remanence is older than pre-Torridian Group tectonic deformation.

The stereoscopic vision module, developed us-ing two off-the-shelf cameras and a light emitting diodes lighting system, is mounted on the robot tip. An autostereoscopic screen is adopted to display the surgical scenario {{as an alternative to}} 3 -D helmets or polarizing glasses. A rough position of the stereocam-era can be determined along the abdominal wall by dragging the robot with a set of external permanent magnets (EPMs). Once the camera is set in the desired position, the EPMs provide fixation, while the internal mechanism allows fine <b>tilt</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Consid-ering the deformable round shape of the insufflated abdomen wall and in order to replicate the precise roll motion usually provided by the endoscopist’s hands, this prototype embeds an actuated mecha-nism that adjusts the stereocamera horizon and thus prevents any visual discomfort.

Results show the general contribution of motion cueing to the simulation experience and suggest that motion cueing gives drivers an added feedback on which to control their steering inputs. Subjective ratings showed that drivers were generally influenced by the presence of motion cueing and the realism of control induced motions, but not influenced by the quality of control induced motions.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{laparoscopy}} is the consequence of advances made in the field of medical engineering. Each surgical specialty has different requirement of instruments. Laparoscopy was initially criticized owing to the cost of specialized instruments and possible complications due to these sharp long instruments. Also, it necessitated difficult hand eye coordination. Gradually, the technique gained recognition and respect from the medical fraternity since it drastically reduced many of the complications of the open procedure. Minimal access surgery has developed rapidly only after grand success of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Computer aided designing of laparoscopic instruments is an important branch of medical engineering. It is now possible to control the access through microprocessor controlled laparoscopic instruments. New procedures and instruments are innovated regularly which makes it important for the surgeon to be familiar with the developments. Laparoscopy is a technologically dependent surgery and it is expected every surgeon should have reasonably good knowledge of these instruments.

40|$|Changes to {{the visual}} {{environment}} can happen at many timescales, from very transient to semi-permanent. To adapt optimally, the visual system also adjusts at different timescales, with longer-lasting environmental changes producing longer-lasting effects, but how the visual system adapts in this way remains unknown. Here, we show that contrast adaptation-the most-studied form of visual adaptation-has multiple controllers, each operating over a different time scale. In a series of experiments, subjects completed either a contrast matching, contrast detection, or <b>tilt</b> <b>adjustment</b> task, while adapting to contrast at one orientation. Following a relatively longer period (5 min) of adaptation to high contrast, subjects were "deadapted" for a shorter period (e. g., 40 s) to a lower contrast. Deadaptation eliminated perceptual aftereffects of adaptation, but continued testing in a neutral environment revealed their striking recovery. These results suggest the following account: Adaptation was controlled by at least two mechanisms, with initial adaptation affecting a longer-term one and deadaptation affecting a shorter-term one in the opposite direction. Immediately following deadaptation, {{the effects of the}} two mechanisms cancelled each other, but the short-term effects rapidly decayed, revealing ongoing longer-term adaptation. A single controlling mechanism cannot account for the observed recovery of effects, since once deadaptation cancels the initial longer-term adaptation, no trace of it remains. Combined with previous results at very long adaptation durations, the present results suggest that contrast adaptation is possibly controlled by a continuum of mechanisms acting over a large range of timescales...|$|R

No other production car in the world at the time delivered such levels of torque, leading Autocar to suggest, when road testing the 1996 model year car in August 1995, that the makers could have almost deleted the gearbox altogether, such were the enormous levels of low down torque available. 0-60 mph was now officially quoted by Rolls Royce as [...] "sub 6 seconds" [...] and a top speed of 155 mph (UK brochure).

The primary objectives of the investigation include providing verification and improvement for the precise orbit, media, geophysical, and instrument corrections to accurately reduce U. S.

The status of the GFO satellite (instrument and spacecraft operations, orbital tracking and altimeter) is summarized. GFO spacecraft has been accepted by the Navy from Ball Aerospace and has been declared operational since November, 2000. We have participated in four official GFO calibration/validation periods (Cal/Val I-IV), spanning from June 1999 through October 2000. Results of verification of the GFO orbit and geophysical data record measurements both from NOAA (IGDR) and from the Navy (NGDR) are reported. Our preliminary results indicate that: (1) the precise orbit (GSFC and OSU) can be determined to approx. 5 - 6 cm rms radially using SLR and altimeter crossovers; (2) estimated GFO MOE (GSFC or NRL) radial orbit accuracy is approx. 7 - 30 cm and Operational Doppler orbit accuracy is approx. 60 - 350 cm. After bias and <b>tilt</b> <b>adjustment</b> (1000 km arc), estimated Doppler orbit accuracy is approx. 1. 2 - 6. 5 cm rms and the MOE accuracy is approx. 1. 0 - 2. 3 cm; (3) the geophysical and media corrections have been validated versus in situ measurements and measurements from other operating altimeters (T/P and ERS- 2). Altimeter time bias is insignificant with 0 - 2 ms. Sea state bias is about approx. 3 - 4. 5 % of SWH. Wet troposphere correction has approx. 1 cm bias and approx. 3 cm rms when compared with ERS- 2 data.

It is proposed that the perceived exaggeration of geographical slant preserves the relationship between distal inclination and people's behavioral potential.

40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: The {{challenging}} task {{of cellular}} network planning and optimization {{will become more}} and more complex because of the expected heterogeneity and enormous number of cells required to meet the traffic demands of coming years. Moreover, the spatio-temporal variations in the traffic patterns of cellular networks require their coverage and capacity to be adapted dynamically. The current network planning and optimization procedures are highly manual, which makes them very time consuming and resource inefficient. For these reasons, there is a strong interest in industry and academics alike to enhance the degree of automation in network management. Especially, the idea of Self-Organization (SO) is seen as the key to simplified and efficient cellular network management by automating most of the current manual procedures. In this thesis, we study the self-organized coverage and capacity optimization of cellular mobile networks using antenna tilt adaptations. Although, this problem is widely studied in literature but most of the present work focuses on heuristic algorithms for network planning tool automation. In our study we want to minimize this reliance on these centralized tools and empower the network elements for their own optimization. This way we can avoid the single point of failure and scalability issues in the emerging heterogeneous and densely deployed networks. In this thesis, we focus on Fuzzy Q-Learning (FQL), a machine learning technique that provides a simple learning mechanism and an effective abstraction level for continuous domain variables. We model the coverage-capacity optimization as a multi-agent learning problem where each cell is trying to learn its optimal action policy i. e. the antenna <b>tilt</b> <b>adjustments.</b> The network dynamics and the behavior of multiple learning agents makes it a highly interesting problem. We look into different aspects of this problem like the effect of selfish learning vs. cooperative learning, distributed vs. centralized learning as well as the effect of simultaneous parallel antenna tilt adaptations by multiple agents and its effect on the learning efficiency. We evaluate the performance of the proposed learning schemes using a system level LTE simulator. We test our schemes in regular hexagonal cell deployment as well as in irregular cell deployment. We also compare our results to a relevant learning scheme from literature. The results show that the proposed learning schemes can effectively respond to the network and environmental dynamics in an autonomous way. The cells can quickly respond to the cell outages and deployments and can re-adjust their antenna tilts to improve the overall network performance. Additionally the proposed learning schemes can achieve up to 30 percent better performance than the available scheme from literature and these gains increases with the increasing network size...|$|R
40|$|Next {{generation}} precision machines {{will require}} ever more rigid elements {{to achieve the}} required machining tolerances. The presented work focuses on the application of ultra stiff servo-controllable kinematic couplings and hydrostatic bearings to minimize the structural loop of multi-axis precision grinding machines while reducing complexity. The fundamental importance of these ultra stiff, adjustable machine elements is demonstrated {{in the design of}} a grinding machine for 450 mm diameter silicon wafers. A new generation of silicon wafer grinding machines is needed to back-grind large (450 mm diameter) wafers from the production thickness of up to 1 mm down to less than 50 pm so as to reduce the cost of Si-wafer based components. The grinding process {{needs to be done in}} about 90 sec (fine-grinding, e. g. - 200 micron) to 160 sec (coarse grinding, e. g. - 600 micron). After completion of the fine grinding process the wafer must be flat to 0. 1 pm/o 45 mm and parallel to 0. 6 pm/ 450 mm diameter. The surface roughness must be less than Rymax 0. 1 pm and Ra 0. 01 pm. Even though the required machining forces are 1 N/nm is required, which is many times stiffer than a typical machine tool (0. 1 to 0. 3 N/nm). In cooperation with industry, this work had the aim of creating a new machine design philosophy, with an example application that focuses on nano-adjustable kinematic coupling and feedback controlled water hydrostatic bearing technology. This new design philosophy is needed to enable the design of a relatively small footprint, compact precision machines. In particular, a ball screw preloaded height adjustable kinematic coupling and a magnetically preloaded hydrostatic thrust bearing were designed and built. The adjustable kinematic coupling allows for up to 8 mm of vertical height adjust and 7 N/nm stiffness at 26 kN preload. By varying the preload on the coupling by +/- 10 %, in-process nm to micron height and <b>tilt</b> <b>adjustment</b> at > 95 % of the nominal stiffness is possible. Under the assumption of a constant flow supply, the hydrostatic bearing achieves a theoretical stiffness of 1 N/ nm at a 20 micron bearing gap and 7000 N combined gravitational and magnetic preload. In practice, the stiffness is limited by the pressure flow characteristics of the supplying pumps. To increase the bearing stiffness to a required 4 N/ nm, various control loops have been developed and tested. by Gerald Rothenhöfer. Thesis (Ph. D.)

There {{are a few}} minor items needed, such as a white card with aperture in center, visible alignment laser, IR back reflection meter, and a microscope to view the bridge surface. The work was performed on KCP flyers that were 6 and 8 mils wide. The probes used were Oz Optics manufactured with focal distances of 42 mm and 26 mm. Both probes provide a spot size of approximately 80 ?m at 1550 nm. The 42 mm probes were specified to provide an internal back reflection of - 35 to - 40 dB, and the probe back reflections were measured to be - 37 dB and - 33 dB. The 26 mm probes were specified as - 30 dB and both measured - 30. 5 dB. The probe is initially aligned normal to the flyer/bridge surface. This provides a very high return signal, up to - 2 dB, due to the bridge reflectivity. A white card {{with a hole in}} the center as an aperture can be used to check the reflected beam position relative to the probe and launch beam, and the alignment laser spot centered on the bridge, see Figure 1 and Figure 2. The IR back reflection meter is used to measure the dB return from the probe and surface, and a white card or similar object is inserted between the probe and surface to block surface reflection. It may take several iterations between the visible alignment laser and the IR back reflection meter to complete this alignment procedure. Once aligned normal to the surface, the probe should be tilted to position the visible alignment beam as shown in Figure 3, and the flyer should be translated in the X and Y axis to reposition the alignment beam onto the flyer as shown in Figure 4. This tilting of the probe minimizes the amount of light from the bridge reflection into the fiber within the probe while maintaining the alignment as near normal to the flyer surface as possible. When the back reflection is measured after the <b>tilt</b> <b>adjustment,</b> the level should be about - 3 dB to - 6 dB higher than the probes specified back reflection. This 3 to 6 dB increase in back reflection from the surface relative to the probes specified back reflection is the optimal level for acquiring data from the flyer. Data obtained with the LLNL system is shown in Figure 5...|$|R
30|$|Recreational vehicle (RV) {{applications}} of PV are {{unique in that}} the load is geographically mobile as is the structure where the PV is attached, and thus, {{there would be a}} benefit to customizing the bracket for each location to achieve an optimal tilt angle (Lewis 1987; Shu et al. 2006; Calabrò 2009; Mehleri et al. 2010). PV is already an attractive electricity generation option for RV users because it is often off grid and yet requires electrical power and there are several RV PV mounting systems on the market. Unfortunately, these mounting systems are often prohibitively expensive. For example, current RV-mounted solar PV modules use aluminum brackets attached to aluminum standoffs, which significantly hamper distribution as they have approximately the same cost per watt as the modules themselves (Renvu 2014). As PV mounting and racking now makes up a significant fraction of PV system costs, the new developments in 3 -D printing provide the potential for individuals to fabricate PV racking to drive down overall PV system prices. The primary requirement for a successful frugal RV PV mounting system is that it is mechanically stable to enable the RV to drive from location to location with the PV mounted {{on the top of the}} RV, and the secondary requirement is the ability for custom <b>tilt</b> angle <b>adjustment</b> for different latitudes.|$|R
