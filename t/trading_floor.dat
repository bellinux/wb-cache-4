40|$|Background: This {{thesis is}} about {{knowledge}} transfer and diversity at Nordic <b>trading</b> <b>floors.</b> The research {{is focusing on}} knowledge transfer {{and how it is}} influenced by diversity and the ties between homogenous people. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand how the knowledge transfer could be more efficient at Nordic <b>trading</b> <b>floors</b> and whether employees prefer to share knowledge with employees to whom they either have a weak or strong social tie to. We also want to see how homogenous people impact the flow of knowledge transfer. Methodology: This research is conducted through a case study of respondents working at <b>trading</b> <b>floors</b> at two different banks in the Nordic countries. The data is mainly collected through quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews. Conclusions: Knowledge transfer at Nordic <b>trading</b> <b>floors</b> is implemented through different types of training and mentoring and by keeping up with strong social ties which is feeding the sociocultural arena. Homogenous people are contributing to knowledge transfer by spreading tacit knowledge while networking and socializing with each other. Wearing suits and playing golf might therefore help employees at Nordic <b>trading</b> <b>floors</b> to learn more...|$|R

500|$|Jeffrey [...] "Mad Dog" [...] Beck, a star {{investment}} banker {{at the time}} with Drexel Burnham Lambert, {{was one of the}} film's technical advisers and has a cameo appearance in the film as the man speaking at the meeting discussing the breakup of Bluestar.

At first, he turned Stone down because he felt that the film would be a one-sided attack. Stone asked him to reconsider and Lipper read the script responding with a 13-page critique. For example, he argued that it was unrealistic to have all the characters be [...] "morally bankrupt". Lipper advised Stone on the kind of computers used on the <b>trading</b> <b>floor,</b> the accurate proportion of women at a business meeting, and the kinds of extras that should be seated at the annual shareholders meeting where Gekko delivers his [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech. Stone agreed with Lipper's criticism and asked him to rewrite the script. Lipper brought a balance to the film and this helped Stone get permission to shoot {{on the floor of the}} New York Stock Exchange during trading hours. Lipper and Stone disagreed over the character of Lou Mannheim. Stone shot a scene showing the honest Mannheim giving in to insider trading, but Lipper argued that audiences might conclude that everyone on Wall Street is corrupt and insisted that the film needed an unimpeachable character. Stone cut the scene.|$|E
