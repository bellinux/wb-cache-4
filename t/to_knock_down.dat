Jones was able to execute {{multiple}} throws and takedowns {{during the first two}} rounds, at one point suplexing Bonnar. Jones also had the most success striking and was able <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> his opponent with a spinning elbow-strike. Bonnar rallied with strikes against the tiring Jones in the third round, but the bout went the distance with the judges scoring it 29–28 once and 30–27 twice all in favor of Jones.|$|E

5|$|Northeast of Eoline, {{the tornado}} {{weakened}} to EF2 intensity, continuing to cause significant damage as it crossed County Road 9, Alabama State Highway 5, and County Road 26, south of West Blocton. Several mobile homes and site-built homes were either destroyed or sustained major damage. Along the path, thousands of trees were downed. The tornado continued to weaken {{as it moved}} {{to the east of}} West Blocton, continuing <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> trees. More trees were downed as the tornado crossed the Cahaba River and lifted just northeast of Marvel at 6:55p.m. CDT (2355 UTC), not far from the Shelby County border.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Nova Scotia, {{the winds}} from Carol were strong enough <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> trees and power lines in New Brunswick. Light rainfall, peaking at 2.44inches (62mm) in the province, caused street {{flooding}} in Moncton. The rainfall reached as far west as Ontario, {{and as far}} east as Prince Edward Island, where rainfall reached 1.73inches (44mm). Winds in the latter province damaged roofs and downed some trees, resulting in minor power outages. Further north in Quebec, adverse conditions from the storm delayed a search party after a plane crash.|$|E
5|$|While passing {{south of}} Bermuda, Felix {{produced}} sustained winds of 63mph (102km/h) with gusts to 80mph (129km/h). The winds were strong enough <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> trees and leave 20,000people without power, although most outages were quickly restored. Television service was also interrupted. The storm also destroyed a few fishing boats and damaged hotels along the island's southern shore, where prolonged high surf caused considerable beach erosion. The Causeway connecting St. David's Island with the mainland sustained some damage, contributing {{to an estimated}} $2.5 million in losses on Bermuda. The hurricane's passage postponed the scheduled vote for Bermuda's independence.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} break, Jack's girlfriend CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) {{moved in with}} him. Avery decides to redecorate Jack's apartment. He is not keen on the idea, but not wanting to say no or give into Avery's demands, decides to employ the Fabian strategy—named after Fabius Maximus, a Roman general who {{employed}} a strategy of avoiding battles, instead wearing the enemy down by attrition. Jack is successful in avoiding redecorating the apartment; he agrees <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> a wall instead. At {{the end of the}} episode, however, he realizes that Avery has emulated the military genius of Hannibal, outmaneuvering his Fabian strategy, and he ecstatically realizes they are a perfect match, far beyond the level of mere soul-mates.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{generated}} by the Pacific electric ray can be enough <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> an adult human. It should be treated with caution, especially at night when it is active, and {{has been known to}} charge at divers with its mouth agape if harassed. It is not known to be responsible for any fatalities, but may have been involved in several unexplained, fatal diving accidents. This species fares poorly in captivity, as it usually refuses to feed when first introduced into an aquarium. Since 2000, the Aquarium of the Bay and the Monterey Bay Aquarium have had some success keeping Pacific electric rays by offering them moving food.|$|E
5|$|Carol {{maintained}} its intensity {{as it moved}} inland, and its winds were strong enough <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> trees and power lines in New Hampshire. One tree fell onto a car, killing a person, and there were three deaths overall in the state, along with $3million in damage. There was also a death in neighboring Vermont. Carol produced winds of up to 80mph (130km/h) in Augusta, Maine. Throughout the state, the winds downed hundreds of trees, some of which damaged houses, wrecked cars, destroyed one building, or fell onto power lines. Fallen trees blocked highways, and one person was injured by a falling tree limb. Downed power lines left several counties without power or telephone services. The winds flattened hundreds of acres of corn in North Livermore, and throughout the state, there was heavy damage to the apple crop. Damage to the apple crop amounted to $1.7million. While moving west of Maine, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, including a report of 2.15inches (63mm) in 12hours. Along the coast, high waves damaged boats. In Maine, the hurricane killed three people, injured at least eight, and caused $10million in damage, the costliest natural disaster in the state's history. Carol lost this distinction 10days later when Hurricane Edna caused $15million in damage in the state.|$|E

25|$|Hi-Low-Jack: This term {{refers to}} the 1-, 7-, and 10-pins, which are on the three corners of the triangle. Trying <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> all three in one shot (with no wood) is {{sometimes}} a contest {{as part of a}} televised candlepin bowling program.|$|E
25|$|A game of bowling {{consists}} of ten frames. In each frame, the bowler {{will have two}} chances <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> as many pins as possible with their bowling ball. In games {{with more than one}} bowler, as is common, every bowler will take their frame in a predetermined order before the next frame begins. If a bowler is able <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> all ten pins with the first ball, they are awarded a strike. If the bowler is able <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> all 10 pins with the two balls of a frame, it is known as a spare. Bonus pins are awarded for both of these, depending on what is scored in the next two balls (for a strike) or one ball (for a spare). The bowler is allowed to throw two extra balls for achieving a strike in the tenth frame, or one extra ball for achieving a spare. This allows for a potential of 12 strikes in a single game, and a maximum score of 300 pins, a perfect game. The player with the highest pinfall at the end of ten frames wins. Although, if there is a time limit and if time runs out before the end of ten frames bowling stops, and the person with the highest pinfall wins the game.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an optimal}} bowling ball {{speed at which}} the player maximizes the chance <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> all ten bowling pins. Optimal ball speed, which {{is defined as the}} time it takes for the ball to travel from one foot past the foul line to the head pin, is 2.3 seconds (this number can shift to 2.2 or 2.4 {{depending}} on the dryness or slickness of the lane). A ball that is rolled too fast will not give the pins enough time to “mix” with other pins, or in other words, to knock each other down in a domino effect motion. Conversely, a ball rolled too slowly will deflect too much and will not be able <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> all the pins.|$|E
