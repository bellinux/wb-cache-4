5|$|Bound for a London {{show from}} Liverpool, The Beatles escape {{a horde of}} fans ("A Hard Day's Night"). Once they are aboard the train and trying to relax, various interruptions test their patience: after a dalliance with a female passenger, Paul's {{grandfather}} is confined to the guard's van and the four lads join him <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him company. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr play a card game, entertaining some schoolgirls before arriving at their desired destination ("I Should Have Known Better").|$|E
5|$|Catelyn {{arrives in}} King's Landing, {{supposedly}} in secret. However, she is {{taken by a}} pair of city watchmen to a brothel owned by Littlefinger. He meets her to tell her that he had her brought <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her safe and hidden. Varys, also present, reveals that he learned of Catelyn's arrival through his spies. The three of them and Ser Rodrik discuss the attempted murder of Bran. Littlefinger shocks them all by admitting that the assassin's dagger was once his own. He claims that he lost it to Tyrion Lannister, betting on Jaime Lannister to win a previous tourney. Littlefinger arranges a meeting between Eddard and Catelyn, and Eddard reluctantly takes on Littlefinger as an ally who will help them find Bran's assailant.|$|E
25|$|From the 1860s to 1880s, {{settlers}} in Burrard Inlet used Brockton Point, Anderson Point, and nearby Deadman's Island as burial grounds. This practice stopped when the Mountain View Cemetery opened in 1887. Deadman's Island {{had already had}} a long history as a burial site. In 1865, unsuspecting newcomer John Morton found old cedar boxes in the trees. They turned out to be coffins that had been placed <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the remains of important indigenous persons out of reach of wild animals.|$|E

25|$|The Village of Wish: This is {{the tiny}} town of Wish, where Lyra lives with her parents, Fidget and Faye, and her grandparents, Tangle and Aeval. It’s an insular place, far from cities and civilization. The town is {{surrounded}} by tall walls, not to keep the residents inside, for they have no desire to leave the safety and warmth of their community. The walls are <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the outside world outside, and are secured with complex weighted locks first seen in Dream Chronicles. The streets are cobbled, lined with colorful dwellings and stores. Beyond the walls of Wish lie lush forests and winding roads that, eventually, lead to other larger towns. But the folk of Wish have little desire to visit those distant places. Their homes are secure in their beloved village where, they believe, no harm can come to them.|$|E
25|$|When Sultan Mehmed II succeeded {{his father}} in 1451, it was widely {{believed}} that the young ruler, then 19 years old, would prove incapable—and that he would pose no great threat to Christian possessions in the Balkans and the Aegean. This optimism was reinforced by friendly assurances made by Mehmed to envoys sent to his new court. But Mehmed's actions spoke far louder than his mild words. Beginning early in 1452, he built a second Ottoman fortress (Rumeli hisarı) on the Bosphorus, on the European side several miles north of Constantinople, set directly across the strait from the similar fortress, Anadolu Hisarı, which his great-grandfather Bayezid I had previously built on the Asian side. This pair of fortresses gave the Turks complete control of sea traffic on the Bosphorus; specifically, it prevented help from the north, the Genoese colonies on the Black Sea coast, from reaching Constantinople. (The new fortress was also known as Boğazkesen, which held the dual meanings 'strait-blocker' or 'throat-cutter', emphasizing its strategic position.) In October 1452, Mehmed ordered Turakhan Beg to lead a large force into the Peloponnese and remain <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Thomas and Demetrios (despotes in Southern Greece) from assisting their brother Constantine XI Palaiologos during the impending siege of Constantinople.|$|E
500|$|Diệm later implicated two Americans, George Carver and Russ Miller for {{involvement}} in the plot. Both had spent the coup attempt with the rebel officers. Durbrow had sent them <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> track of the situation, but Diệm {{felt that they were}} there to encourage the uprising; the coup group's desired changes were very similar to those advocated by Durbrow in previous months. It was later revealed that Carver had friendly relations with the coup leaders and then arranged for Thuy to be evacuated from South Vietnam when the loyalists overwhelmed the paratroopers. Carver had also spent some of the coup period in a meeting with civilian rebel leaders at Thuy's house, although it is not known if he pro-actively encouraged Diệm opponents. The Ngô brothers indicated to the Americans that Carver should be deported, and soon after, Carver received a death warrant. The threat was supposedly signed by the coup leaders, who were ostensibly angry because Carver had abandoned them and withdrawn American support for them. The Americans thought that Nhu was the real culprit, but told the Ngô family that they were removing Carver from the country for his own safety, thereby allowing all parties to avoid embarrassment. Years later, Carver said he agreed with the rebels' thinking that Diệm was doing poorly and needed to be replaced, saying he was [...] "absolutely convinced" [...] that a regime change was needed to [...] "achieve American objective in Vietnam". In his memoir, Don claimed Miller had cryptically encouraged him to overthrow Diệm a few months before the coup attempt.|$|E

500|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Lady Rosebery drove her husband to follow her own political agenda, or that of her family. For her the rewards seem to have been the pleasure of seeing a husband she undoubtedly adored in the high office of which she felt him worthy. There is no doubt that she tempered her husband's more radical views. Immediately following his wife's death Rosebery retired from politics, writing in October 1891 [...] "The sole object of my ambition has disappeared with the death of my wife." [...] Proof of the widespread belief in society that Lady Rosebery was the stable element of the partnership was confirmed shortly after her death, by Queen Victoria, following a then rare public speech by Rosebery, in which he supported Home Rule for Ireland. The Queen was shocked and thought the speech [...] "almost communistic" [...] and went on to attribute Rosebery's [...] "shocking and disappointing" [...] behaviour to the fact that [...] "poor Lady Rosebery is not <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him back." [...] While Queen Victoria always personally liked Rosebery, she mistrusted his politics. The Queen had thoroughly liked Lady Rosebery and wrote Rosebery several letters of condolence, likening his loss to the untimely death of her own consort, Prince Albert. It seems that the Queen's antipathy to Jews was confined to elevating them to the peerage. This view had softened by 1885. In 1890 she accepted a luncheon invitation from Lady Rosebery's cousin Ferdinand de Rothschild and toured Waddesdon Manor albeit eating in a separate dining room to the Jewish members of the party.|$|E
500|$|Umberto II, {{the crown}} prince of Italy, visited the ship {{while she was in}} Messina on 17 July 1942. By August, the {{surviving}} Italian heavy cruisers, Bolzano, Trieste, and [...] had been reorganized as the 3rd Division. On 11 August, the three cruisers sortied to intercept a British convoy, but failed to locate it. Two days later, while still on the patrol, Bolzano was torpedoed by the submarine , causing extensive damage. The torpedo explosion started a fire, prompting the crew to flood the forward magazines to prevent the fire from spreading to them and detonating the propellant charges stored <b>there.</b> <b>To</b> <b>keep</b> her from sinking, her crew beached the ship on the island of Panarea. The ship was listing 45degrees and the crew had to abandon the ship. The fire burned through the next day, until some of the crew were able to return to extinguish it. She remained there until 15 September, by which time damage control parties had shored up the damaged hull enough to allow tugs to tow her back to Naples, where she entered the drydock so the damage could be inspected. Temporary repairs were effected, and in October she was transferred further north, to La Spezia, where permanent repairs would be completed. While she was awaiting repairs, the Regia Marina considered rebuilding the ship into a hybrid cruiser-aircraft carrier. This would have required removing the bridge structure, forward gun turrets, and splitting the forward funnel to vent {{on either side of the}} ship so a flight deck and hangar could be installed. The proposal came to nothing, however, as the Italian war economy could not spare the necessary resources to repair Bolzano, let alone convert her. Piecemeal repairs were made as material became available through early 1943, but she remained out of action. On 5 June, American B-17 bombers attacked La Spezia but did not damage Bolzano.|$|E

2500|$|By 1576, no {{one wanted}} to {{challenge}} his rule, {{and the rest of his}} reign was to be quiet. Other states in the region—in particular, rival Ceylonese kingdoms—were keen to receive his support. For his part, Bayinnaung viewed himself as the protector of Theravada Buddhism, and had long tried to promote and protect the religion in Ceylon. Two decades earlier, in November 1555, he sent rich presents to the Tooth of Kandy, and bought land <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> lights continually burning at the shrine. His craftsmen beautified the temple and swept it with the broom made of his hair and his chief queen's. In 1560, upon hearing that the Portuguese had seized and taken the tooth relic to Goa, he sent envoys to secure the relic for 800,000 silver kyats (41,000 pounds sterling) and shiploads of rice, whenever needed, to provision the Portuguese garrison at Malacca. Viceroy Constantino de Bragança was interested but Archbishop of Goa, Gaspar de Leão Pereira, overruled him by threatening the viceroy with an Inquisition style trial. In 1561, [...] "while the Burmese envoys gazed in frozen horror, the archbishop placed the Tooth in a mortar, grounded it to powder, burned it in a brazier, and cast the ashes into the river." [...] To be sure, the Ceylonese claimed that the destroyed relic had been a replica, and that the true Tooth had remained in Ceylon. Two teeth, claiming to be the real Tooth, appeared in Ceylon, one at Colombo and the other at Kandy.|$|E

2500|$|Lead {{prosecutor}} Linda Drane Burdick in {{the prosecution}} rebuttal told the jurors {{that she and her}} colleagues backed up every claim they made in their opening statement six weeks ago, and implied that the defense never directly backed up their own opening-statement claims. [...] "My biggest fear is that common sense will be lost in all the rhetoric of the case," [...] she said, insisting that she would never ask the jury to make their decision based on emotion but rather the evidence. [...] "Responses to guilt are oh, so predictable," [...] she stated. [...] "What do guilty people do? They lie, they avoid, they run, they mislead... they divert attention away from themselves and they act like nothing is wrong." [...] She suggested that the garbage bag in the trunk of the car was a [...] "decoy" [...] put <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> people from getting suspicious about the smell of the car when she left it abandoned in a parking stall directly beside a dumpster in an Amscot parking lot.
