5|$|Czechoslovakia's {{hardline}} {{communist government}} agreed {{to close its}} border with East Germany <b>to</b> <b>choke</b> off the exodus. The closure produced uproar across East Germany and the GDR government's bid to humiliate refugees by expelling them from the country in sealed trains backfired disastrously. Torn-up identity papers and East German passports littered the tracks as the refugees threw {{them out of the}} windows. When the trains passed through Dresden, 1,500East Germans stormed the main railway station in an attempt to board. Dozens were injured and the station concourse was virtually destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} match, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff faced Smackdown General Manager Theodore Long (with Palmer Canon). Two referees from each show officiated the match. Theodore Long, began by {{avoiding}} Eric's attacks. As Canon climbed on the apron, and distracted the referees, Bischoff used his obi <b>to</b> <b>choke</b> Long. Bischoff continued choking Long and applied the sleeper hold. Cannon distracted the referees again as Long hit Bischoff with his shoe. The Boogeyman's music played with Bischoff sending the referees {{up the ramp}} to stop him. The Boogeyman delivered a pumphandle slam to Bischoff and Long pinned Bischoff to win the match.|$|E

5|$|Although {{not a major}} characteristic, Mahone is {{depicted}} as remarkably good at unarmed combat (probably due to his military background). It is surprising when Lincoln attempts to kill him, he rapidly masters him and tries <b>to</b> <b>choke</b> him; Lincoln only manages to master him by squeezing his previous gunshot wound, only to be overcome again and have Mahone's gun on him. When one of Lechero's men attempts to stab Michael {{at the beginning of}} season three, Mahone stops him and breaks his neck in seconds. He is also the only one T-Bag believed could kill Sammy, but when the tunnel crumbles on top of Sammy Mahone rapidly masters his men. In season four when Christina Rose orders her bodyguard to kill Mahone, he beats both of them down within seconds.|$|E
5|$|Many doctors {{considered}} {{the case to}} be unusual and debated the cause of death. Some, including family members, accused them of criminal negligence; that Shepard was fed well before the operation, which could have allowed him <b>to</b> <b>choke</b> on vomit. No autopsy was made, but an inquest {{was made by the}} coroner. The two doctors to perform the operation made a statement on March 28, 1893 that after prior examinations no diseases were found and his heart and lungs seemed healthy. A Tribune reporter met doctor William J. Morton, son of possible ether discoverer William T. G. Morton who had first used it in 1846. Morton said it was most improbable Shepard died of ether, ensuring its safety when properly used, and that deaths were one in 25,000. He recommended an autopsy.|$|E
5|$|After the match, an in {{ring segment}} {{took place in}} which The Big Show, entered the ring and asked the crowd whether they thought {{he should have been}} in the Championship Scramble for the WWE Championship. SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, who portrays an {{on-screen}} authority figure for the SmackDown brand, then came to the ring and proceeded to insult the Big Show, and demanded that he leave the ring. Druids then came to the ring bringing a casket, and The Undertaker appeared on the TitanTron, telling Guerrero to either get in the casket herself or he would put her in it. Guerrero refused to enter the casket voluntarily, so The Undertaker began to come to ringside. The Big Show held back Guerrero as The Undertaker came to the ring. Once he was in the ring, The Undertaker began <b>to</b> <b>choke</b> Guerrero, but the Big Show turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero. He proceeded to attack The Undertaker, and restrained him to allow Guerrero to slap him and spit in his face.|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{performance of}} a modified turbine for driving a supersonic compressor is presented and compared {{with the performance of}} the original configuration to illustrate the effect of small changes in the ratio of nozzle-throat area to rotor-throat area. Performance is based on the performance of turbines designed to operate with both blade rows close <b>to</b> <b>choking.</b> On the basis of the results of this investigation, the ratio of areas is concluded to become especially critical in the design of turbines such as those designed to drive high-speed, high-specific weight-flow compressors where the turbine nozzles and rotor are both very close <b>to</b> <b>choking...</b>|$|R

25|$|Incorporating a gag into a neck corset {{presents}} a few safety issues: should the wearer begin <b>to</b> <b>choke,</b> {{it is not}} easy to remove the gag quickly.

25|$|The {{vigorous}} {{growth of}} oats tends <b>to</b> <b>choke</b> out most weeds. A few tall broadleaf weeds, such as ragweed, goosegrass, wild mustard, and buttonweed (velvetleaf), occasionally create a problem, as they complicate harvest and reduce yields. These {{can be controlled}} with a modest application of a broadleaf herbicide, such as 2,4-D, while the weeds are still small.|$|E

25|$|A {{combination}} of factors creates the necessary conditions for bioluminescence: red mangrove trees surround the water (the organisms have been related to mangrove forests although mangrove is not necessarily associated with this species); a complete lack of modern development around the bay; the water is cool enough and deep enough; and a small channel to the ocean keeps the dinoflagellates in the bay. This small channel was created artificially, being the result of attempts by the occupants of Spanish ships <b>to</b> <b>choke</b> off the bay from the ocean. The Spanish believed that the bioluminescence they encountered there while first exploring the area, {{was the work of}} the devil ('El Diablo') and tried to block ocean water from entering the bay by dropping huge boulders in the channel. The Spanish only succeeded in preserving and increasing the luminescence in the now isolated bay.|$|E

Vader refuses, however, and uses the Force <b>to</b> <b>choke</b> him {{as a way of}} putting him in his place and orders him to ensure the Death Star project has not been compromised. At the end of the film, Vader boards the disabled Rebel flagship Profundity with a cadre of Imperial stormtroopers and kills several Rebel soldiers as he attempts to recover the plans.
