500|$|Most of the episode's plot, namely a {{group of}} {{children}} trapped on an island and the breakdown of law, order and civility, is a reference to William Golding's 1954 novel Lord of the Flies.

500|$|The {{formulation}} of Russell as an Asian American character, {{along with the}} casting of an Asian American in the role was met positively as well. Both Nagai and the film were awarded by the East West Players for the depiction of Russell.

[...] The character is noted as Pixar's first lead Asian character, and was further positively received within the added context of historical non-Asian castings for Asian roles in entertainment. Asian American organizations and entertainment websites, such as media watchdog Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA), Racebending.com, and Angry Asian Man praised the character and Pixar for its diverse character depictions, noting the general lack of Asian American lead characters and Asian actors cast in entertainment. In an interview with NPR in 2013, Angry Asian Mans Phil Yu reflected on the character's lack of typical Asian stereotyping, stating, [...] "You know, he just happens to be Asian and he's, you know, really adorable character.

2500|$|In QCD {{the same}} <b>thing</b> <b>happens</b> with virtual quark-antiquark pairs; {{they tend to}} screen the color charge. [...] However, QCD has an {{additional}} wrinkle: its force-carrying particles, the gluons, themselves carry color charge, and in a different manner. [...] Each gluon carries both a color charge and an anti-color magnetic moment. [...] The net effect of polarization of virtual gluons in the vacuum is not to screen the field, but to augment it and change its color. [...] This is sometimes called antiscreening. [...] Getting closer to a quark diminishes the antiscreening effect of the surrounding virtual gluons, so the contribution of this effect would be to weaken the effective charge with decreasing distance.|$|E
