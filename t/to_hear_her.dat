5|$|In social circles, Aspasia {{was noted}} for her {{ability as a}} conversationalist and adviser rather than merely an object of {{physical}} beauty. Plutarch writes that despite her immoral life, friends of Socrates brought their wives <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> converse.|$|E
5|$|Tannakin's {{deformity}} {{was soon}} discovered, and many locals came <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> pig-like speech or {{to watch her}} feed from the trough. The old woman was located, tried and convicted for witchcraft, but even at the stake refused or was unable to reverse the enchantment.|$|E
5|$|Baeyertz {{joined the}} YWCA {{and was soon}} preaching to large crowds. By 1879, she was the {{featured}} speaker for a campaign of sermons in Sandhurst, eventually converting 200 individuals. She then conducted a Christian mission to Ballarat, with crowds of 2,300 assembling <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> talk. Emilia conducted a number of further missions around Victoria between 1880 and 1890. In 1890, she went to New Zealand to preach, {{before moving on to}} North America. She arrived in San Francisco in October 1890, and spent two years giving sermons in conjunction with the YMCA in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Boston in USA as well as Toronto and Ottawa in Canada.|$|E

60|$|Then {{the door}} opened and Alicia--for so I was used <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>her</b> called, nor did I ever think of her as my aunt in my own mind--came in, and a little in the rear my tall, dark uncle.|$|R

5|$|Church members {{reported}} that Father Feit's confession line moved slowly {{that night and}} that he was away from the sanctuary several times. When the canal at the crime scene was drained several days after the discovery of Garza's body, Feit's photo slide viewer was found in the canal. Fellow priests noticed scratch marks on Feit's hands after midnight mass, and they said it was irregular for Feit to have taken Garza to the church rectory <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> confession. The McAllen Police Department initially said that Feit passed polygraph tests, but the tests were later said to be inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{was born}} in Cove, Oregon, on September 27, 1899 at his {{grandparents}} home. His parents were Joshua Cullow Smith and Rhoda Harris Smith. When he {{was three years old}} he traveled with his family to Central America where his father's business was headquartered. He would often run away from home to go to his grandmother's <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> talk about the pioneer days of covered-wagons. As a child, Smith attended public schools in Oregon. After high school he attended two years at Principia College in St. Louis, Missouri, but did not graduate.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Daenerys {{stands before}} the {{gathered}} khals {{in the temple}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> fate. There, she recalls her pregnancy ritual in this temple and her husband's vow to conquer Westeros. She accuses the khals of being unsuited to leading the Dothraki due to their lack of ambition, and says she will lead them. When Khal Moro and the other khals threaten to gang-rape her instead of serving her, she tells them they will die instead. She tips two braziers onto the straw floor, quickly setting the entire temple on fire and killing the khals, who have been barred inside by the younger Dosh Khaleen. A Dothraki crowd of thousands witnesses Daenerys emerge from the burning temple, naked but unburned. Amazed, they, Jorah and Daario bow down to her.|$|E

5|$|We were {{supposed}} to be with her in the studio for a couple of days. She kindly invited us to stay a little longer. We don't know what's going to end up on the album but it was an absolute you know honor... For me being such a fan for so long it was so exciting <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> vocal in the room right next to me, coming out of her head really sounding exactly like all those records we all love and she's a pleasure to work with because she's so in tune with who she is and what she wants to sing. I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E
5|$|When Albert Wilson {{joined the}} army in 1940, Ferrier reverted to her maiden name, having until then sung as 'Kathleen Wilson'. In December 1940 she {{appeared}} {{for the first time}} professionally as 'Kathleen Ferrier' in a performance of Handel's Messiah, under Hutchinson's direction. In early 1941 she successfully auditioned as a singer with the Council for the Encouragement of the Arts (CEMA), which provided concerts and other entertainments to military camps, factories and other workplaces. Within this organisation Ferrier began working with artists with international reputations; in December 1941 she sang with the Hallé Orchestra in a performance of Messiah together with Isobel Baillie, the distinguished soprano. However, her application to the BBC's head of music in Manchester for an audition was turned down. Ferrier had better fortune when she was introduced to Malcolm Sargent after a Hallé concert in Blackpool. Sargent agreed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> sing, and afterwards recommended her to Ibbs and Tillett, the London-based concert management agency. John Tillett accepted her as a client without hesitation after which, on Sargent's advice, Ferrier decided to base herself in London. On 24 December 1942 she moved with her sister Winifred into a flat in Frognal Mansions, Hampstead.|$|E
25|$|She spoke {{publicly}} against state-regulated prostitution in {{the city}} hall of Berlin on 14 May 1880, but very few people turned up <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day as the meeting with the President, First Lady Laura Bush {{announced}} in an interview during an official visit to Africa a preference for her husband to nominate a woman to O'Connor's seat. Bush was surprised at his wife's public comments on the Supreme Court, but said he would be open <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>her</b> advice when she returned from her trip.|$|R

25|$|On Good Friday in 1196, Constance summoned Joachim of Fiore to Palermo <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> {{confession}} in Palatine chapel. Initially {{she sat on}} {{a raised}} chair, but when Joachim told her that as {{they were at the}} places of Christ and Mary Magdalene, she needed to lower herself, she sat on the ground.|$|E
25|$|On August 23, 2010, the First District Court of Appeal {{unanimously}} upheld Knoller's conviction, {{finding that}} she acted with a conscious disregard {{for human life}} when her Presa Canario escaped and killed Whipple. The California Supreme Court declined <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> appeal of that decision. Knoller is currently serving her sentence at Valley State Prison for Women in Chowchilla.|$|E
25|$|Mark {{telephones}} Rose but {{is unable}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> clearly. He promises to visit {{just before the}} connection fails. Rose sees two shadowy figures preparing to enter her apartment. She leaves through a back door, but is followed. She is grabbed from behind by a clawed assailant and brutally guillotined across the neck with glass from a broken window.|$|E
60|$|Of {{the other}} {{letters in the}} collection, I need take no special notice. I {{returned}} the whole correspondence to Helena, and waited <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from <b>her.</b>|$|R

25|$|After a scene break, Alison {{explains}} to Helena that she lost the baby—one of Jimmy's cruellest speeches in Act1 expressed the wish that Alison would conceive {{a child and}} lose it—the two women reconcile but Helena realises that what she's done is immoral and she in turn decides to leave. She summons Jimmy <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> decision and he lets her go with a sarcastic farewell.|$|E
25|$|On November 1, 2010, Diehl-Armstrong {{was convicted}} of armed bank robbery, {{conspiracy}} to commit armed bank robbery, and of using a destructive device in a crime. She {{was sentenced to life}} plus 30 years on February 28, 2011. In November 2012 the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed her conviction. In January 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court denied her petition for certiorari, declining <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> case. In December 2015, Diehl-Armstrong lost a second appeal of her conviction. She died in prison of natural causes on April 4, 2017, at the age of 68, following a battle with breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|She {{moved to}} Brussels {{in the spring}} of 1912 after Queen Elizabeth of Belgium had {{expressed}} a desire <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her.</b> She accompanied Émile Chaumont in the premiere of her Violin Sonata in D minor, which was dedicated to Octave Maus, and was then performed in Paris by her close friend, the French pianist Lazare Lévy, whom she had met in Miss Ellis's class. Lévy premiered her piano solo piece Caledonian Market, in 1923. In January 1912 her friend Henry Wood conducted the premieres of her Suite miniature and Nocturnes at the Sunday Concerts. In 1913 she returned to Brussels for the last time to accompany Jane Bathori-Engel in four of her Verlaine settings.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Manni uses a blind lady's phone card {{to request}} {{money from a}} friend, only to fail. His friend says he can only give 500 marks which makes Manni angry. Lola keeps on running and ends up {{parallel}} to an ambulance that narrowly misses crashing into a glass pane carried by workmen. Lola runs on to meet Manni, {{who is about to}} begin the robbery. She shouts his name but he is unable <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> and enters the store. Lola decides to help him. Once they obtain the money, they flee on foot but find themselves surrounded by police. Manni throws the bag with money up in the air, causing a nervous police officer to accidentally shoot Lola in the chest.|$|E
25|$|Even in Albani's {{final season}} at Covent Garden in 1896, she {{continued}} to receive strongly positive reviews. The greatest triumph of her career came on 26 June 1896, when she sang Isolde in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, with Jean de Reszke in his first London Tristan, Louise Meisslinger as Brangäne, David Bispham as Kurwenal, Édouard de Reszke as King Marke, and Luigi Mancinelli conducting. There were {{a total of four}} performances, all of which sold out despite the higher than normal ticket prices and the oddity that the opera was sung in German. On 24 July she sang Valentine in Les Huguenots. There had been no announcement, and few people would have realized {{it was the last time}} they were <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> in opera. Her career at Covent Garden had lasted for twenty-four years.|$|E
25|$|In {{regards to}} the prophetic works, the {{character}} Oothoon represented America in Visions of the Daughters of Albion and she is raped by the character Bromion. The book represents her as trapped by a philosophical system created by John Locke, {{and no one is}} able <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> pleas except for the daughters of Albion. The implications of the work are taken up again in America with the King of England trembling as he witnesses Orc and the rebelling colonies. Although there is a vision of rebellion, there is no actual freedom {{at the end of the}} poem just as in the Visions of the Daughters of Albion. Unlike the Visions of the Daughters of Albion, America, as well as Europe, describes nations that are trying to determine their own destiny instead of individuals trying to deal with theirs. The Song of Los is connected to both America and Europe in that it describes Africa and Asia, which operate as a sort of frame to the other works. As such, the three works are united by the same historical and social themes.|$|E
