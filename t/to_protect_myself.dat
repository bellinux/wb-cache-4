500|$|... "Can't B Good" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by D. DoRohn Gough and Ne-Yo. It was recorded between 2007 and 2008 at SouthSide Studios, in Atlanta, Georgia. Although Jackson didn't write the song, Jackson described [...] "Can't B Good" [...] as a song reflecting her seven-year relationship with songwriter/producer Jermaine Dupri, saying, [...] "I'd been hurt before, and I was trying <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>myself.</b> I'm glad I {{allowed myself to}} accept it. He's very attentive and affectionate, a beautiful soul".|$|E
500|$|... "Bye Bye" [...] {{served as}} the album's thirteenth track, and also {{composed}} by Carey and Stargate. An [...] "inspirational power ballad", it is influenced by R and pop music genres. The song is built on an understated and simple piano-driven melody, that is decorated with a soft bass-line. Lyrically, the song was described by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", and finds Carey remembering both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. While the verses are dedicated to him, the chorus was written in a third-person point of view, for her fans: [...] "This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady / Put your hand way up high / We will never say bye / Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / Lift your hands to the sky / Because we won't ever say bye bye". While listing several forms of loss, Carey encourages to never let go, and always live with their memory, and put their hands up if they ever lost someone, 'cause we won't ever say bye bye'. Serving as the album's closing number, [...] "I Wish You Well" [...] was compared to the closing number on Mimi, [...] "Fly Like a Bird". Similarly, [...] "I Wish You Well" [...] incorporates gospel influence into its melody of [...] "rousing piano waltz", that [...] "extends forgiveness to those who have wronged her in the past and is pretty much interchangeable with its predecessors." [...] Extensively making use of the whistle register, she references Mottola in another light than [...] "Side Effects": [...] "'I Wish You Well's' message to Mottola is similarly striking. Accompanied by a piano and some multi-tracked backing vocals, Carey sings: [...] "Still bruised, still walk on eggshells / Same frightened child, hide <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>myself</b> / But you can't manipulate me like before." [...] She then prescribes Bible study and says, [...] "I wish you well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Foot {{stayed at}} the Daily Mirror for {{fourteen}} years, managing to survive at the paper during the years Robert Maxwell was in control from 1984. Foot wrote in 2000: [...] "Maxwell demeaned everyone who worked for him, myself included, but I was able by sheltering behind the editor <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>myself</b> from his more monstrous excesses”. He finally fell out with the new Mirror editor, David Banks in March 1993, nearly seventeen months after Maxwell's death. Banks, he claimed, had {{accused him of being}} [...] "mad", and a contemporaneous boardroom coup had introduced, according to Foot, a [...] "systematic campaign of union-busting" [...] at the company. He left the Mirror in 1993 when the paper refused to print articles critical of its new management and placed him on sick leave. [...] "This is Stalinist psychiatry," [...] he said at the time. [...] "If you don't agree with us you must be mad." [...] Banks also revealed Foot's salary as being £55,000 {{at the time of the}} row over the unpublished column, although Foot himself said that it was actually a few thousand less.|$|E

"My small savings {{would have}} been soon exhausted, even if I had been old enough and strong enough <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> them <b>myself.</b> As things were, my few shillings were taken from me by gypsies. I {{had no reason to}} complain. They gave me food and the shelter of their tents, and they made me of use to them in various ways. After a while hard times came to the gypsies, as they had come to the strolling players. Some of them were imprisoned; the rest were dispersed. It was the season for hop-gathering at the time. I got {{employment}} among the hop-pickers next; and that done, I went to London with my new friends.|$|R

2500|$|Controversy {{followed}} the fight when Jones demanded that his loss be [...] "overturned to a disqualification victory, citing illegal use of hand wraps." [...] Jones labelled Green a cheater and filed a formal complaint to the NSW Combat Sports Authority (NSWCSA). In the {{months following the}} fight, Jones also claimed that the referee stopped the fight too early. In March 2010 Green responded to the allegations with {{an open letter to}} Jones, stating [...] "THE hand wraps were the same wraps I used in five previous world title fights, in Germany, Montreal, Australia ..." [...] and [...] "MY hand wraps were personally inspected by three independent inspectors of the NSW Combat Sports Authority and they each certified that my wraps were legal and gave me no advantage whatsoever." [...] The NSWCSA dismissed the matter, however Green claimed that he had [...] "spent {{tens of thousands of dollars}} on legal representation and fees in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>myself</b> from unsubstantiated claims that should've been ignored from the outset." [...] Green also claimed that the [...] "unnecessary investigation ... ruined his chance to promote a lucrative 'super bout' against the legendary Bernard Hopkins in Sydney" [...] and urged the state premier Kristina Keneally to [...] "launch an investigation into the Combat Sports Authority." ...|$|E

5000|$|In modern times, the Czech Republic {{practices}} surgically castrating convicted sex offenders. According to {{the reports}} compiled by Council of Europe, a human-rights forum, the central European country physically castrated at least 94 prisoners in the 10 years up to April 2008. The Czech Republic defends this procedure as voluntary and effective. According to Dr. Martin Hollý, {{director of the}} Psychiatric Hospital Bohnice in Prague, none of the nearly 100 sex offenders who had been physically castrated had committed further offences. One serial offender stated that being castrated was the [...] "best decision" [...] he ever made: [...] "On the one hand you have <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the potential victims {{and on the other}} hand I wanted <b>to</b> be <b>protected</b> from <b>myself,</b> I wanted to live like a normal person." [...] Don Grubin, a professor at Newcastle University's Institute of Neuroscience who also runs a chemical castration program backed by the U.K.'s Ministry of Justice, was initially opposed to physical castration. After visiting the Czech Republic, however, he agreed that some form of castration might be of benefit to some sex offenders.|$|R
