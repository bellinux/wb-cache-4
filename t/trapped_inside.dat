5|$|The Boss {{wakes up}} in a 1950s sitcom set {{in the city of}} Pleasantville, devoid of {{violence}} and foul language. The Saints' computer hacking specialist, Kinzie Kensington, contacts the Boss and informs them that they are <b>trapped</b> <b>inside</b> a simulation, with each of the Zin's prisoners <b>trapped</b> <b>inside</b> personal simulations of their own fears in order to break their will. With Kinzie's help, the Boss breaks free of the simulation and joins Kinzie and Keith in a stolen Zin ship.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePhotovoltaic {{research}} {{has moved from}} popular solar cells, based on crystalline silicon substrates with thicknesses of around 250 Î¼m, to the thin film structures saving large amount of the active material. The next generation of solar cells requires substantial increase of the energy conversion efficiency, which {{can be achieved by}} enhancing of the optical <b>trapping</b> <b>inside</b> the cell. In this work we study the efficiency of light <b>trapping</b> <b>inside</b> vertical silicon nanowire solar cells. The main focus is on the optical <b>trapping</b> <b>inside</b> single vertical nanowires, which can enhance optical absorption far beyond capabilities of a thin film. Spectral optical absorption modeling based on RCWA together with the electromagnetic field distribution analysis gave insight into the light <b>trapping</b> <b>inside</b> the nanowires. Results provide a guide for the optimization of nanowires diameters, density and length for maximal short circuit currents with minimal material demands...|$|R

Maitreya was to be contained within Phoebe's personal separate project, but the character found her way into the First Person Shooter program.|$|E
5|$|On December 4 Nina {{had reached}} its peak {{intensity}} of 85mph. At this time, a polar high pressure system moved {{off the coast of}} Japan. The system reached Nina on December 6 and forced the hurricane into a southward path. Twenty hours after the turn, the cold air from the system got <b>trapped</b> <b>inside</b> the circulation of Nina and caused the storm to rapidly dissipate. The last advisory on the system was issued early on December 7 while Nina was at depression strength south of Midway Atoll.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} flooding stranded {{many residents}} who {{were forced to}} stay in place long after Hurricane Katrina had passed. Stranded survivors dotted the tops of houses citywide. Some were <b>trapped</b> <b>inside</b> attics and were unable to escape. Many people chopped their way onto their roofs with hatchets and sledge hammers, which Mayor Nagin had residents urged to store in their attics in case of such events. Clean water was unavailable, and power outages were expected to last for weeks.|$|E

5|$|Xenon {{can also}} form endohedral {{fullerene}} compounds, where a xenon atom is <b>trapped</b> <b>inside</b> a fullerene molecule. The xenon atom {{trapped in the}} fullerene can be observed by 129Xe nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Through the sensitive chemical shift of the xenon atom to its environment, chemical reactions on the fullerene molecule can be analyzed. These observations are not without caveat, however, because the xenon atom has an electronic influence on the reactivity of the fullerene.|$|E

Despite the fact that Niki no longer has her powers due to the virus, she agrees to help. They follow a GPS signal emitted by Monica's cell phone and find her in an abandoned warehouse. She is tied up and the warehouse is burning around her. Using what remains of her superhuman strength, Niki manages to help Monica escape, but her strength eventually fails and she ends up <b>trapped</b> <b>inside</b> the building as it explodes.|$|E

5|$|De Grasse {{arrived at}} Cap-FranÃ§ais on 15 August. He {{immediately}} dispatched {{his response to}} Rochambeau's note, which {{was that he would}} make for the Chesapeake. Taking on 3,200 troops, De Grasse sailed from Cap-FranÃ§ais with his entire fleet, 28 ships of the line. Sailing outside the normal shipping lanes to avoid notice, he arrived at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay on August 30, and disembarked the troops to assist in the land blockade of Cornwallis. Two British frigates that were supposed to be on patrol outside the bay were <b>trapped</b> <b>inside</b> the bay by de Grasse's arrival; this prevented the British in New York from learning the full strength of de Grasse's fleet until it was too late.|$|E

Jack is annoyed with Martha's new life and tries to convince her to leave Cam. Cam sets fire to his club and Martha is left <b>trapped</b> <b>inside</b> until Jack saves her. Jack and Martha become good friends once more, until they sign their divorce papers. Jack then begins a relationship with Sam Tolhurst which devastates Martha.|$|E
5|$|On January 24, 1945, the 3rd Belorussian Front led by General Chernyakhovsky, {{surrounded}} {{the capital city}} of East Prussia, KÃ¶nigsberg. The 3rd Panzer Army and around 200,000 civilians were <b>trapped</b> <b>inside</b> the city. In response to this, General Georg-Hans Reinhardt, commander of the Army Group Center, warned Hitler of the imminent Soviet threat, but the FÃ¼hrer refused to act. Due to the rapid approach of the 2nd Belorussian Front led by General Rokossovsky, Nazi authorities in KÃ¶nigsberg decided to send trains full of refugees to Allenstein, without knowing that the town had already been captured by the Soviet 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps.|$|E
30|$|Sugar-mediated thermal {{reduction}} of nitrite-loaded THCPSi NPs produces and entraps NO inside of THCPSi NPs [18, 33]. NO formation is {{the consequence of}} chemical acidification and redox conversion. Upon drying, d-glucose is oxidized, and correspondingly, nitrite within the pore structure is converted to NO [43]. The dried glucose layer also assists in <b>trapping</b> <b>inside</b> the pores. The entrapped NO is retained within the pores of the NPs until exposed to moisture [18, 23].|$|R

Its owner struggles to chase the ball but then manages to catch it for a second. Unfortunately, the ball escapes and is run over by a truck driven by The Chemical Brothers. The basketball re-inflates after the accident, jumps into and eventually gets <b>trapped</b> <b>inside</b> an old phone booth near Baross Street, swells to an enormous size, and explodes.|$|E
5|$|The Nokota {{horse is}} a feral and semi-feral horse breed {{located in the}} {{badlands}} of southwestern North Dakota in the United States. The breed developed in the 19th century from foundation bloodstock consisting of ranch-bred horses produced from the horses of local Native Americans mixed with Spanish horses, Thoroughbreds, harness horses and related breeds. The Nokota was almost wiped out during the early 20th century when ranchers, in cooperation with state and federal agencies, worked together to reduce competition for livestock grazing. However, when Theodore Roosevelt National Park {{was created in the}} 1940s, a few bands were inadvertently <b>trapped</b> <b>inside,</b> and thus were preserved.|$|E
30|$|B is the Boltzmann constant. The E is 11.7 Â meV at 100 Â K, which {{increases}} from 11.7 to 17.5 Â meV (200 Â K). For comparison, the trap energy dropped from 0.26 Â eV before annealing to 0.12 Â eV after annealing. It {{was consistent with}} the explanation that the annealing process reduced the deep level <b>traps</b> <b>inside</b> the individual GaSb nanowire [29]. In addition, Simpkins et al. obtained the trap energy of coaxial AlGaN/GaN nanowires which was 75 Â meV [31].|$|R
30|$|If charge {{collection}} probabilities are similar among the cells, quantum efficiency {{depends on the}} light <b>trapping</b> <b>inside</b> the solar cell [34 â 37].
