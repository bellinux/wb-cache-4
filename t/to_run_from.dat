5|$|In 1964, a Route 94 freeway was {{proposed}} <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> I-80 in Netcong {{north to the}} planned Route 23 freeway in Hamburg, following US 206 north to Newton and current Route 94 to Hamburg. In the late 1960s, the NJDOT planned for the Route 94 freeway <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> I-80/US 46 in Columbia northeast to the New York border near Wawayanda State Park. The NJDOT hoped to get funding for the freeway in 1970 for it to become an Interstate highway as it was planned to serve a proposed national recreation area along the Delaware River {{that would have been}} built in conjunction with the controversial Tocks Island Dam project. This proposed Interstate, which was <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> I-80 in Hope Township to I-84 in Port Jervis and continue northeast along US 209, was denied funding. After reviewing the proposal again in 1972, the NJDOT determined that the freeway would cost $96 million. It was eventually canceled due to environmental concerns and financial constraints.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1927, {{the route}} between present-day Route 70 in Lakehurst and present-day County Route 527 in Toms River {{was a part}} of Pre-1927 Route 18, which was legislated in 1923 <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> Camden to Toms River. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 37 was legislated <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> Route 27 and Route 30 (now U.S. Route 1 Business, U.S. Route 206, and Route 31) in Trenton to Route 35 (now Route 88) in Point Pleasant, passing through White Horse, Allentown, Lakehurst, Toms River, and Seaside Heights. The portion between Trenton and White Horse {{replaced}} part of Pre-1927 Route 2, while the portion between Lakehurst and Toms River replaced part of Pre-1927 Route 18.|$|E
5|$|What is now Route 44 was {{originally}} legislated as Route 17S in 1923, a route that was <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> Penns Grove to Westville. By 1927, however, the only portion of Route 17S that had existed was {{a road that}} ran from Penns Grove south to Salem. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering that occurred that year, Route 44 was designated <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> Penns Grove to Westville, replacing what had been legislated as Route 17S. By {{the end of the}} 1930s, Route 44 was extended south from Penns Grove to Salem and US 130 was also designated along with Route 44 north of Penns Grove by 1941.|$|E

5|$|What is now Route55 was {{originally}} {{proposed in the}} 1950s as a toll road called the Cape May Expressway that was <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> the Walt Whitman Bridge to Cape May. In 1962, the New Jersey Expressway Authority was created to build the Cape May Expressway and the Atlantic City Expressway. However, by 1965, the road to Cape May {{was turned over to}} the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) and designated as Route55, which was <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> Westville to Cape May Court House. The first portion of the route opened around Millville in 1969 while the section bypassing Vineland was completed in the 1970s. Route55 was completed north to Deptford in 1989.|$|E
5|$|What {{would become}} I-195 was first {{proposed}} in the late 1950s as a toll road called the Trenton-Asbury Park Expressway {{that was to be}} operated by the New Jersey Highway Authority, the owner of the Garden State Parkway at the time. In 1965, this road would be incorporated into a planned Central Jersey Expressway System. The western portion would {{become a part of the}} Route 37 freeway that was <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> Trenton to Seaside Heights while the eastern portion would become a part of the Route 38 freeway that was <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> Camden to Belmar. The two freeways were to meet near Fort Dix. By 1967, plans for the Route 38 freeway were canceled, leaving Route 37 as the only planned east-west freeway through central New Jersey. The routing of this freeway, which was to be called the Central Jersey Expressway, was changed <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> the Trenton area east to Wall Township In addition, officials pushed for Interstate Highway funding for the freeway, with funds to be diverted from the canceled I-278 in Union County. The proposed freeway would cost $60 million.|$|E
5|$|DE 9 was {{designated}} <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> US 113 (now DE 1) west of Kitts Hummock north to US 13 in Smyrna by 1936, following its current alignment to Leipsic and Smyrna-Leipsic Road to Smyrna. By 1942, {{what is now}} DE 9 between the Taylors Bridge area and Port Penn was paved. In 1956, New Castle Avenue was widened to a four-lane divided highway between Landers Lane and Rogers Corner.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s, the Lodge Freeway was {{proposed}} <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> Detroit {{as far as}} the Fenton–Clio Expressway (US23) at Fenton. The intersection with the Edsel Ford Freeway, next to Wayne State University was built in 1953 and was the first full freeway-to-freeway interchange built in the United States. The freeway was dedicated on November 7, 1957, and opened without any state trunkline designation between downtown and the Wyoming Curve. The section from the Edsel Ford Freeway (now I-94) into downtown Detroit was designated as US12 by the middle of 1960.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Route 9 was {{designated}} {{by the state of}} New Jersey <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> Phillipsburg east to Elizabeth, passing through Clinton, Somerville, Plainfield, and Westfield. With the establishment of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, U.S. Route 22 was concurrently designated along the entire length of Route 9. A year later, in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 28 was legislated <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> Phillipsburg east to the Goethals Bridge, replacing pre-1927 Route 9 between Phillipsburg and present-day Route 439 in Elizabeth, and following current Route 439 toward the Goethals Bridge. Meanwhile, the former alignment of pre-1927 Route 9 east became Route 27-28 Link, as it provided a connection between Route 27 and Route 28. A spur of Route 28, named Route S28, was also legislated in the 1927 renumbering and was <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> Route 28 in Middlesex southeast to Route 4 (now Route 79) in Matawan. What was built of this route became Route 18 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. By 1941, U.S. Route 22 was eventually moved from Route 28 to follow Route 28-29 Link and Route 29 between the Somerville area and Newark. Also, U.S. Route 22 was realigned to its current alignment along Route 24 and Route 24-28 Link in Phillipsburg, with the alignment along Route 28 becoming U.S. Route 22 Alternate (now Route 122). In the 1953 renumbering of state highways, which eliminated long concurrencies between U.S. and state highways, the western terminus of Route 28 was placed at the intersection of U.S. Route 22 and Easton Turnpike in Branchburg Township, with the designation west of there dropped in favor of U.S. Route 22 and U.S. Route 22 Alternate. In addition, Route 28 was moved to its current alignment in Elizabeth, replacing Route 27-28 Link; Route 439 {{was designated}} along the former alignment of Route 28 that ran to the Goethals Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, PA 263 was {{designated}} <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> US 611 in Willow Grove to the Delaware River in Centre Bridge. The Upper York Road portion of PA 263 was paved by 1940. By 1970, the route was widened into a four-lane highway between County Line Road and PA 413 in Buckingham.|$|E

5|$|In the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 17N {{received}} the Route 2 designation, and was defined <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> Route 7 in North Arlington to the New York border near Suffern, New York. By 1937, the whole old road north of Rutherford was bypassed {{by a new}} four-lane divided highway {{with the exception of}} the 1927 bridge over the Saddle River in Ridgewood, north of the Paramus Road interchange. This old alignment joins at Paramus Road and leaves just north of the bridge at Franklin Turnpike, which only has access to the southbound lanes through a RIRO intersection. A short-lived spur of Route 2, Route 2N, was defined in 1938 <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> Route 2 (Ridge Road) in Lyndhurst west along Kingsland Avenue and over the Passaic River on the Park Avenue Bridge into Nutley, where it would end at Union Avenue (west of Route 7). In 1930, New York had renumbered its state routes; the extension of Route 2 north and west into New York had remained New York State Route 17. New Jersey had not assigned a Route 17 in the 1927 renumbering, and so in March 1942, Route 2 was numbered Route 17 to match and provide a single number for military caravans during World War II.|$|E
5|$|In the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, a spur of Route 41 called Route S41 was legislated <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge south to Berlin along what is today Route 73. A {{southern}} extension of Route S41 called Route S41A was proposed <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> Berlin south to Route 42 (now U.S. Route 322) in Folsom in 1938. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route S41 and Route S41A were renumbered to Route 73 {{in order to}} match Pennsylvania Route 73. With {{the establishment of the}} 500-series county routes in 1952, the current alignment of Route 73 between Berlin and Blue Anchor became a part of County Route 561 while it became County Route 561 Spur between Blue Anchor and Folsom. By 1969, Route 73 was designated south of Berlin along County Route 561 and County Route 561 Spur to the Atlantic City Expressway. By the 2000s, Route 73 was extended south along with County Route 561 Spur from the Atlantic City Expressway to U.S. Route 322.|$|E
