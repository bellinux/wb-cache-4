25|$|Gram, {{the unit}} of mass, is {{commonly}} spelt as such and not gramme, which is somewhat found in British English. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>holds</b> true for the word's derivates (e.g. kilogram is more common than kilogramme).|$|E
25|$|If R {{is a given}} {{commutative}} ring, {{then the}} set of all polynomials in the variable X whose coefficients are in R forms the polynomial ring, denoted R. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>holds</b> true for several variables.|$|E

50|$|Recently, Moyer {{has signed}} an {{endorsement}} deal with BC Rich Guitars, who now manufacture Moyer's signature Havoc bass. They {{can do this}} because they are owned by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>holding</b> company as Traben.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>holds</b> true for Mandarin and Cantonese in {{that another}} {{structure}} {{needs to be}} used when {{only one of the}} nouns being compared is mentioned. Note also that Teochew and Mandarin both use a pre-modifier (before the adjective) while Cantonese uses a post-modifier (after the adjective).|$|E
25|$|So, for example, {{there is}} a {{polynomial}} for which the positive part of its range is exactly the prime numbers. (On the other hand, no polynomial can only take on prime values.) <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>holds</b> for other recursively enumerable sets of natural numbers: the factorial, the binomial coefficients, the fibonacci numbers, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{compactness}} theorem has a limiting {{effect on}} which collections of first-order structures are elementary classes. For example, the compactness theorem implies that any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models has an infinite model. Thus {{the class of}} all finite graphs is not an elementary class (<b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>holds</b> for many other algebraic structures).|$|E
5|$|Ramona {{no longer}} has <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>hold</b> on <b>the</b> country's {{imagination}} as it once did. It is estimated that only 1% of visitors to the Casa de Estudillo now {{are aware of the}} house's ties to the novel.|$|R

25|$|Today {{there are}} about 470,000 Finnish-speakers in Sweden. Finnish, a Uralic language, has long been spoken in Sweden (<b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>holds</b> true for Swedish in Finland, see Finland-Swedes, Åland), as Finland {{was part of the}} Swedish kingdom for centuries. Ethnic Finns (mainly first and second {{generation}} immigrants) constitute up to 5% of the population of Sweden. A high concentration of Finnish-speakers (some 16,000) resides in Norrbotten.|$|E
25|$|The English word God and its {{counterparts}} in other languages are normally used for {{any and all}} conceptions and, in spite of significant differences between religions, the term remains an English translation common to all. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>holds</b> for Hebrew El, but in Judaism, God is also given a proper name, the tetragrammaton YHWH, in origin possibly {{the name of an}} Edomite or Midianite deity, Yahweh.|$|E
25|$|Teaching that Christ is {{risen from}} the dead and is alive, the Catholic Church holds that when the bread is changed into his body, not only his body is present, but Christ {{as a whole is}} present (i.e. body and blood, soul and divinity.) <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>holds</b> for the wine changed into his blood. This {{teaching}} goes beyond the doctrine of transubstantiation, which directly concerns only the change of the substance of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ.|$|E

25|$|In the 1880s Wessels {{was also}} a leading figure in the discussions about the {{extension}} of the railway network of the Orange Free State and the direct connections with the Cape Colony and the South African Republic. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>holds</b> true for the efforts to forge a South African customs union in the 1890s. Wessels was a very practical man and was qualified by he British as the 'business brain' in the Orange Free State government. For several years he was a director of the National Bank of the Orange Free State.|$|E
25|$|The Leningrad Codex, {{which dates}} to {{approximately}} {{the same time as}} the Aleppo codex, has been claimed by Paul E. Kahle to be a product of the ben Asher scriptorium. However, its colophon says only that it was corrected from manuscripts written by ben Asher; there is no evidence that ben Asher himself ever saw it. However, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>holds</b> true for the Aleppo Codex, which was apparently not vocalized by ben Asher himself, although a later colophon, which was added to the manuscript after his death, attributes the vocalization to him.|$|E
25|$|His wide-ranging {{interests}} {{included the}} Greeks and the Romans. Again, {{like all other}} Arabic historians, he was unclear on Greece before the Macedonian dynasty that produced Alexander the Great. He is aware that there were kings before this, but is unclear on their names and reigns. He also seems unfamiliar with such additional aspects of Greek political life as Athenian democratic institutions. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>holds</b> for Rome prior to Caesar. He is, though, the earliest extant Arabic author to mention the Roman founding myth of Romulus and Remus.|$|E

25|$|Slab-pull: Current {{scientific}} {{opinion is that}} the asthenosphere is insufficiently competent or rigid to directly cause motion by friction along {{the base of the}} lithosphere. Slab pull is therefore most widely thought to be the greatest force acting on the plates. In this current understanding, plate motion is mostly driven by the weight of cold, dense plates sinking into the mantle at trenches. Recent models indicate that trench suction plays an important role as well. However, the fact that the North American Plate is nowhere being subducted, although it is in motion, presents a problem. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>holds</b> for the African, Eurasian, and Antarctic plates.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, foreign experts {{working on}} behalf of the United Nations said that the {{historically}} low levels of transparency and continued denial of full investigations to international monitors have reinforced negative perceptions of the Transnistrian government, although recent co-operation by Transnistrian authorities may have reflected a shift in the attitude of Transnistria. Their report stated that the evidence for the illicit production and trafficking of weapons into and from Transnistria, has in the past been exaggerated, although the trafficking of light weapons is likely to have occurred before 2001 (the last year when export data showed US$900,000 worth of 'weapons, munitions, their parts and accessories' exported from Transnistria). The report also states that <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>holds</b> true for the production of such weapons, which is likely to have been carried out in the 1990s, primarily to equip Transnistrian forces.|$|E
25|$|Because Sum and Product are binary operations, M6 and M7 {{admit the}} sum and product {{of only a}} finite number of objects. The fusion axiom, M8, enables taking the sum of {{infinitely}} many objects. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>holds</b> for Product, when defined. At this point, mereology often invokes set theory, but any recourse to set theory is eliminable by replacing a formula with a quantified variable ranging over a universe of sets by a schematic formula with one free variable. The formula comes out true (is satisfied) whenever the name of an object that would {{be a member of the}} set (if it existed) replaces the free variable. Hence any axiom with sets can be replaced by an axiom schema with monadic atomic subformulae. M8 and M8' are schemas of just this sort. The syntax of a first-order theory can describe only a denumerable number of sets; hence, only denumerably many sets may be eliminated in this fashion, but this limitation is not binding for the sort of mathematics contemplated here.|$|E
