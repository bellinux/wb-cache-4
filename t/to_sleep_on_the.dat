5|$|Initial {{work began}} on the rock on 7 August 1838. Stevenson and 21 workmen arrived on board the sailing vessel Pharos and began to unload the barrack, whose massive legs were set into holes blasted out of the rock. After only two days the site had to be {{abandoned}} as a storm swept in from the Atlantic. It was a further six days before they could resume the punishing schedule of 16 hours a day work between 4am and 8pm. Fearing sea sickness, many of the man preferred to attempt <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> damp rocks than on the ever-rolling Pharos.|$|E
5|$|Most terns hunt fish by diving, often {{hovering}} first, and {{the particular}} approach technique used can help to distinguish similar species at a distance. Sea terns often hunt in association with porpoises or predatory fish, such as bluefish, tuna or bonitos, since these large marine animals drive the prey to the surface. Sooty terns feed at night as the fish rise to the surface, and are believed <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wing since they become waterlogged easily. Terns of several species will feed on invertebrates, following the plough or hunting on foot on mudflats. The marsh terns normally catch insects in the air or pick them off the surface of fresh water. Other species will sometimes use these techniques if the opportunity arises. An individual tern's foraging efficiency increases with its age.|$|E
5|$|The Restoration is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Hugh Logan, a single father who leaves his little girl, May, at home when he goes on a business trip. On {{the way to the}} city he is attacked by robbers and left in the road. He is found and taken in, but he suffers from amnesia. He falls in love with Maud Neals and proposes to her. Due to the prolonged absence of her father, May is taken to an orphan asylum, but she escapes. May goes to the city and ends up stopping <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> doorstep of the Neals' home. Maud finds her and takes her in, where Logan recognizes his daughter and his memory comes back. Little is known of the production credits, but the film does feature Marie Eline as the little girl. It was released on August 5, 1910 and was met with mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

25|$|As night {{approached}} the hijackers {{took all the}} hostages up several decks to the Arazzi Lounge on the Promenade deck and gave them blankets to spend the night. While they ordered the ship's kitchen to send food up for the hostages, they placed containers they claimed were filled with gasoline around the room (apparently as a bluff {{to ward off the}} ship's crew). Despite fears of grenades and gasoline, the passengers attempted <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor while the ship steamed towards Syria.|$|E
25|$|When the Ruhr Pocket was captured, the Allies {{had over}} 660,000 prisoners-of-war to care for, {{including}} as of 8 May 252,592 POWs in the Golden Mile (German: Goldene Meile) camp between Remagen and Niederbreisig. The prisoners were forced <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. They had no sanitation and little food or water. The camp {{was taken over}} by the French on 11 July 1945, but by the time they closed it 9 days later, a total of 1,247 inmates had died of dysentery, malnutrition and exhaustion.|$|E
25|$|While {{studying}} in Khartoum, Naguib had often been censured {{and sometimes even}} whipped by his British tutors for criticizing Britain's occupation of Egypt and Sudan. At this time, Naguib chose French Emperor Napoleon as a role model, even deciding <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor instead of on a bed to imitate the great French general. Soon, however, Napoleon was replaced in Naguib's affections by Mustafa Kamil, {{the founder of the}} National Democratic Party, and later he found another mirror in Saad Zaghlul. Some years after he was ousted from power, Naguib also came to somewhat admire Mohandas Gandhi of India.|$|E

25|$|The 330 (Norwegian) Squadron was {{activated}} on 25 April 1941 {{and based}} at RAF Reykjavik, {{also known as}} Corbett Camp, {{in the vicinity of}} Reykjavík on Iceland. The squadron originally consisted of 128 men, all Norwegian. These had various backgrounds: 80 were trained at Little Norway; most of the rest were sailors from sunken ships or men brought in from Lofoten during the Operation Claymore raid. These lacked military training, forcing the squadron to establish a recruit school. The base consisted of a dozen Nissen huts. The facilities were primitive and the soldiers forced <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> muddy ground.|$|E
25|$|All the {{buildings}} suffered damage {{but along with}} the collapsed Nuevo León building, buildings such as those called Veracruz, Coahuila, Zacatecas, Oaxaca, Puebla, Jalisco, Churubusco, Guelatao, 2 de Abril, 15 de Septiembre, Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, ISSSTE 11, Querétaro, Guanajuato, Ignacio Comonfort, Ignacio M. Altamirano, Jesús Terán, Ponciano Arriaga, Niños Héroes and 20 de Noviembre suffered severe damage such as severely cracked foundations. In {{the days after the}} quake, military and police cordoned off ten buildings to keep people out, leading a number of them <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets. Twelve buildings in the complex were so severely damaged that they were demolished in the next six months.|$|E
25|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1908, Girault vividly described {{an encounter with}} bedbugs in 1907 {{in a hotel room}} in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was reluctant <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed after discovering the bedbugs as he entered the room a little after midnight. He eventually decided to keep the lights on and to lie across the bed without getting under the covers. He slept fitfully, constantly waking up to find bedbugs scurrying away after feeding on him. At 3:30 AM, he eventually gave up and slept on a rocking chair. Despite the discomfort, he systematically described the behaviour and stages of maturity of the bedbugs, the general conditions of the room, and attempted to search for eggs and moultings of the insects.|$|E

25|$|Despite going {{days without}} eating, and having <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrestling mats at the gym, {{he refused to}} turn professional, {{partially}} to preserve his amateur status and he also did not want his mother to discover he was earning {{a living as a}} boxer. When friends who knew him from his gym work, and seeing him struggle to pay for a decent meal, asked why he didn't take up the nightly paid 'private' fights, Welsh initially refused. Despite his misgivings, the next day Welsh took up the offer and knocked out Kid Allen in a third round bout. This was followed with wins over Johnny Mezier, Young Peterson and Jack Cameron. With his financial issues resolved and being able to pay for steady meals, at the age of nineteen, Welsh decided to turn professional.|$|E
25|$|Akin {{arrives in}} Owerri {{and asks for}} the ticket to Abuja, but he is told there's no flight {{scheduled}} for Abuja {{for the rest of}} the day. Mary also arrives in Abuja and calls her number through the phone in her hand. She tells Akin she is in Abuja and they both decide to find a way out. Akin asks Mary to go to his mother's house in Abuja, Akin also finds himself in Mary's Father's house which is a very ancient house. Mary's sister, Cynthia (Ada Ameh) introduces Akin to their father (Chika Okpala) as Mary's boyfriend. Mary is also received happily by Akin's mother, Kike (Joke Silva) and she believed Mary is Akin's girlfriend. Mary tries to explain to her what happened, but she is too overjoyed to listen. Akin finds it hard to adapt to the life in the Village: He asks the family for a cutlery to eat 'swallow' food and he is laughed at, He is also unable to sleep with the others on bed and goes <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> veranda. He finds it hard <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Veranda again due to mosquitoes. He gets up and calls Mary instead and they get to discuss many things like the fact that her sister's sin is that she beats her husband and she's accused of pulling her husband's penis this time around. Mary asks Akin to speak to Cynthia on her behalf because she thinks Cynthia will listen to him as Cynthia seems to like him. Akin also asks Mary to go to the company's retreat on his behalf. He tells her that all she needs to do is give the chairman the information on the memory card of his phone. Akin talks to Cynthia and she accepts to behave responsibly at the family meeting and to start behaving responsibly at home in order to preserve the future of her kids. At the meeting she kneels down for the Elders and apologizes to everyone in a sober state and eventually bursts into tears.|$|E
25|$|From all reports, Allen was {{not only}} {{respected}} but was warmly regarded by his troops of his 1st Infantry Division, particularly the enlisted men. Like General George Patton, Allen's superior {{for much of the}} war, Allen generally placed his headquarters far forward, as close to the front line as possible. Unlike Patton, however, Allen did not bother greatly with his military appearance, frequently going without clean uniforms and haircuts. He was also reportedly the only American general officer in the European and North African theaters who preferred <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, rather than on a cot or in a bed. However, despite a casual attitude toward his own personal appearance, Allen did not tolerate slovenliness or incompetence in the troops under his command. He expected his soldiers to keep their weapons and equipment in perfect working order and trained the men constantly to keep them combat ready.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{students}} and professors persuaded others still sitting on the lower tiers of the Monument to get up and leave, while soldiers beat them with clubs and gunbutts and prodded them with bayonets. Witnesses heard bursts of gunfire. At about 5:10 am, {{the students}} began to leave the Monument. They linked hands and marched through a corridor to the southeast, though some departed through the north. Those who refused to leave were beaten by soldiers and ordered to join the departing procession. Having removed the students from the square, soldiers were ordered to relinquish their ammunition, after which they were allowed a short reprieve from 7:00 am to 9:00 am. The soldiers were then ordered to clear the square of all debris left over from the student occupation. The debris was either piled and burnt on the square, or placed in large plastic bags that were then airlifted away by military helicopters. After the cleanup of the square was completed the troops stationed at The Great Hall of the People remained confined within for the next nine days. During this time the soldiers were left <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floors and fed a single packet of instant noodles split between three men daily. Officers apparently suffered no such deprivation, and were served regular meals apart from their troops.|$|E
500|$|The Sutherland Room lies at {{the rear}} east wing {{of the house and}} was once the bedroom of the Earl of Althorp in the first few centuries of the house when it was fashionable for the {{occupants}} <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground floor and guests <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor. This was still the case during the Holland restoration, and as a result the room was ignored, so it retains many of the earlier mouldings not seen in many other parts of the house. It contains two fireplaces made by John Vardy and James Stuart which were originally situated in Spencer House, and the room has the original 17th-century cornice. The paintings in the room were selected by the current owner Charles Spencer to honour John, Third Earl Spencer and his passion for foxhunting. After it ceased usage as a bedroom, on special occasions the room would be full of life; on Christmas Day the room would be [...] "transformed into a Christmas fairyland, with clockwork Santas, snowmen and angels all spinning and chiming in the candlelight". The children would have their places marked by a small cake with their names written on it in icing.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{played a}} variety of sports in his youth, but {{considered}} baseball to be his favorite. He developed quick reflexes through various athletic and leisure activity, such as bouncing a ball off the concrete steps {{in front of his}} house, moving in closer to reduce reaction time with each throw. When not at the local YMCA or playing sports, Smith sometimes went with friends to the neighborhood lumberyard, springboarding off inner tubes and doing flips into sawdust piles (a precursor to his famous backflips). In 1965, at age ten, he endured the Watts Riots with his family, recalling that, [...] "We had <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor because of all the sniping and looting going on." ...|$|E

[...] In truth, however, this only applied to the early mascots who were allowed to freely roam the campus. [...] The contemporary mascots, certainly since the 1980s and likely earlier, are under the constant supervision of the Mascot Corporal and not allowed to freely roam about the cadet's quarters. [...] Another tradition is that if she chooses to bark in class, that session is cancelled. [...] Upon {{the death of a}} current or former mascot, a full military funeral is held at Kyle Field, which usually attracts several thousand mourners.|$|E

Vinnie and Crazy spend the evening drinking, meet up with two prostitutes and go <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach, waking up to find themselves close to a group of showering women and their mobster husbands. While Crazy inches over to the ladies, Vinnie finds a dead body buried in the sand. The screams of Vinnie and the women alert the mobsters, who beat up Crazy. It's later seen that Crazy has killed off the mobsters.|$|E

[...] With their new drummer, Rise Against began to work on The Unraveling at Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette, Indiana, where Principe and Wleklinski had previously recorded material for 88 Fingers Louie. Recording took place {{over the course of}} five weeks, with Mass Giorgini serving as the producer, and Wleklinski serving as the assistant engineer. Wleklinski later remarked on the grueling workdays: [...] "12-hour days for 4 of those weeks, and then 22-24 hours per day during that last week of tracking. These were the times of 'If you don't play it right, you have to play it again,' not 'That was good enough, I'll edit it so it's on time.'" [...] Wleklinski also commented that it was difficult to split his time between recording guitar parts and engineering the songs, and that during the last week he had <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> studio floor.|$|E
