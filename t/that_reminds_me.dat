500|$|In a {{contribution}} for The Washington Post, Desson Howe said [...] "there's a wonderful, unhurried delicacy about Persuasion...as if everyone {{concerned with the}} production knows that, if given time and patience, Austen's genius will emerge. Thanks to assured performances, exacting direction and, of course, inspired writing, it does, in subtle, glorious ways". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker graded the film with an [...] "A–", saying it [...] "should enthral even those who haven't read" [...] the novel. Tucker concluded that the film was [...] "the sort of passionate yet precise comedy <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> why Austen remains such a vital writer". Susan Ostrov Weisser, a professor of nineteenth-century literature, called the film a [...] "faithful parade of Austen's world", and praised Root as the film's [...] "crown jewel" [...] for playing a [...] "fiercely intelligent, regretful, and frustrated Anne Elliot with subtlety and nuance". In 2008, James Rampton of The Independent rated it the fourth best Austen adaptation of all time.|$|E
500|$|... "Upper West Side Story" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many praising the mostly standalone format and {{the rebuilding of}} Neal and Peter's relationship. [...] Morgan Glennon of the Huffington Post called the episode [...] "a really fun undercover romp that still deals with the fallout between Neal and Peter." [...] Michelle Carlbert stated that she [...] "felt like it put Neal and Peter back on track" [...] and that she enjoyed the standalone case. [...] Brittany Frederick of Starpulse.com said that [...] "this is an episode <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> why I {{fell in love with}} White Collar." [...] Frederick compared the episode to [...] "Mr. Monk Goes Back to School", an episode of USA Network's Monk; she likened Baker's character to that of Andrew McCarthy's in Monk, stating that as a villain, McCarthy was evil yet endearing, while Baker appeared genuinely evil. [...] She also praised the series for utilizing comedy rather than drama. [...] Kenny Herzog of The A.V. Club gave the episode a more mixed review, stating that while the series was [...] "at its caper-hatching best," [...] it was [...] "also its most excessively ludicrous." [...] Like Frederick, Herzog praised the use of comedy, though he felt that Baker appeared to be more like [...] "a cartoon bully." [...] He ultimately gave the episode a B-.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics who gave a polarised {{view on the}} writing and handling of Shepherd's death. Ashley Bissette Sumerel of TV Fanatic gave the episode the highest praise in a 5 out of 5 star review highlighting the [...] "interesting possibilities" [...] that the death would offer for the show. However, she stated, [...] "I'm beyond heartbroken. [...] We've seen tragic deaths and lost beloved characters, but never quite like this. I don't think I'll ever get over it." [...] She also acknowledged the show's emotional connect with its audience and it's courage to attempt the [...] "inconceivable". Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly {{took the opportunity to}} reminisce {{the early years of the}} show saying that it's the compelling characters that have made committing to Grey's [...] "irresistible". She added that despite some [...] "weak moments" [...] that the series suffers from, characters like [...] "Meredith or Derek or Webber will have a moment <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> why I keep watching, why I never stopped— so watching one of those characters die hurts. It really, really hurts." [...] In a mixed review for the episode, a Spoiler TV writer criticized the plot calling it a [...] "self-indulgent episode", contrasted it with [...] "well crafted departure of Mark Sloan, or by Lexie Grey". Also criticizing the absence of the series' major cast from the episode the review said, [...] "The presence of so many inconsequential and uninteresting characters was continually in danger of swamping the dreaminess of Derek." [...] However, appreciative of Pompeo's character, the reviewer remarked, [...] "the writing of Meredith was completely on point. She was clinical, as we would expect her to be." ...|$|E
60|$|Some {{sinister}} note in her father's voice {{caused the}} girl to grow of a sudden calm and to assume a rigidity <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of her sister.|$|R

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an 'A', saying [...] "Community is going {{away for a}} while, but it's going away with an episode <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> why I love the show so much. This is a very {{personal}} thing—since humor's subjective like that—but for me, this was the funniest episode since the clip show... I laughed myself silly at this one, {{to the point where}} I was devolving into hiccups at certain scenes, and I'm glad we get to go out on an episode like this, one that plays around with form and makes me laugh." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also praised the Glee-spoofing, saying [...] "'Regional Holiday Music' was the logical, clever, funny endpoint to it." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said, [...] "As with its best theme-episodes, the show bridged the gap between high-concept parody and character-based comedy." [...] TV Fanatic's Leigh Raines gave the episode a 4/5 rating, saying while the show [...] "definitely went out with a bang, it didn't totally blow my socks off... While there were a few moments that upped the ick factor, overall this episode fell on the positive side." [...] She praised Troy and Abed's rap performance, but called the scene where Annie seduces Jeff [...] "creepy". Robert Canning of IGN said it was a [...] "great" [...] episode, but [...] "faltered just a bit" [...] at the end: [...] "Abed's realization that his attempts to brighten the holiday only made things darker, as Jeff had previously suggested, fit the character well enough, but the study group's follow-up felt a bit forced and holiday hokey. Of course, that could well have been the point." ...|$|E
2500|$|Macbeth is then {{shown the}} ghost of Banco and his descendants, eight future Kings of Scotland, verifying the {{original}} prophecy.

2500|$|Simona Halep has {{self-described}} her playing {{style as}} being [...] "an aggressive baseliner" [...] and [...] "she models her game on Justine Henin". Henin herself said the following about Halep: [...] "She has an intelligent game. There {{is a little}} something <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of myself... it is offensive and aggressive." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{bystanders}} surged {{to and fro}} {{about the}} speakers in a manner <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of corraled cattle; others hurried towards them, and our broker's voice rang out: [...] "I'll trade with you at two dollars better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, Captain Wallingford," [...] cut in Jane, {{at one of}} Sarah's {{breathing}} intervals, <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> strongly of the colloquial Frenchman's [...] "s'il crache il est perdu," [...] "You {{know something}} of poor Mrs. Bradfort, I believe?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict wrote: [...] "It’s {{no secret that}} The Simpsons isn’t {{what it used to}} be. The past few seasons have been hit or miss, but once in a while an episode comes along <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> why I’ve kept watching. 'Lisa the Drama Queen' is one of those episodes." [...] Robert Canning of IGN commented: [...] "It's been argued that Lisa episodes of The Simpsons are basically hit and miss. In my opinion, the boring, unfunny Lisa episodes far outweigh the classic Lisa episodes. 'Lisa the Drama Queen' was one of those episodes that fell into the boring majority. There were a number of reasons for this— too many song montages, for one— but ultimately it boiled down to the uninspired storyline. Worst episode of the Simpsons ever." ...|$|E

60|$|The head of {{the valley}} had that half-tamed, ancient aspect <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of the Romans. I could only expect the Roman legions to be encamped down there; and the white goats feeding on the bushes belonged to a Roman camp.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't till Steve said {{something}} <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> then it burst upon me, in one awful shock, that I'd gone and left you, {{and you might}} have knocked me down with a feather," [...] said honest Mac, hiding none of his iniquity.|$|R
6000|$|To Clemantiny {{she added}} in a low, gentle tone, [...] "There's a {{look on his face}} <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of Johnny. It came out so strong when he sat up just now that it made me feel like crying. Don't you notice it, Clemantiny?" ...|$|R

60|$|Now {{from behind}} the throne there {{appeared}} a gorgeous gentleman arrayed in a head-dress <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> faintly of a bishop's mitre, and wearing over his robes a breastplate of precious stones roughly polished, which was half hidden by a very long white beard.|$|R
6000|$|... "'You!' she says, {{with a smile}} <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> {{of lemon}} sherbet. I was waiting up-stairs in the slosh, then, and I was right down here by the door, putting some vinegar and cayenne into an empty bottle of tabasco, and I heard all they said.|$|R
60|$|The robber again paused with agitation. I sat musing {{upon his}} last Frightful words, which proved to what excess the passions may be carried when escaped from all moral restraint.

60|$|Mr. Parker {{ordered a}} {{somewhat}} extensive dinner. Throughout the meal {{we listened to}} a series of adventures in which the hero was always Mr. Moss.

6000|$|He slipped round it, {{making a}} wide circle {{with his usual}} caution, then, seeing the snake which was, by the way, I think, the biggest immamba I ever killed, {{suddenly}} froze, as it were, in a stiff attitude <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of a pointer when it scents game.

60|$|And <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of a {{distinction}} you suggest between Ossian and Homer. I fashion {{it in this}} way: Homer sometimes nods, but Ossian makes his readers nod.|$|E
