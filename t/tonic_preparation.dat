5000|$|The sonata is the {{shortest}} of his piano sonatas, being in a single movement in sonata form and lasting approximately 7-8 minutes. The piece opens with a blasting E major chord for the entire first and second bars and then goes into a toccata-like melody {{for the next few}} bars. This repeats with some variation again after that, and a <b>tonic</b> <b>preparation</b> for two bars leads to the first theme. The first theme, consists of a fairly recognizable harmony with a leaping melody in the right hand. The first theme is mainly in a playful and soft character with some dynamic fluctuations {{towards the end of the}} first theme. It contains some motives that reoccur near the end of the piece.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn an {{in vitro}} {{preparation}} of the crayfish thoracic locomotor system, intracellular recordings have been performed from terminals of a leg joint coxo-basipodite chordotonal organ (CB). In the terminals, some depolarizing events are observed which display all {{the characteristics of the}} primary afferent depolarizations (PADs). PADs reduce the amplitude of orthodromic sensory spikes, and thus correspond to a presynaptic inhibition. PADs are tonic in a <b>tonic</b> <b>preparation,</b> and phasic (phase locked) in a rhythmic preparation. A control of the incoming information from the CB could thus be performed by the central nervous system during fictive locomotion...|$|E

40|$|Astragali Radix (Huang-Qi) is {{a popular}} herbal {{medicine}} commonly used as a constituent in <b>tonic</b> herbal <b>preparations.</b> Hedysarum polybotrys Handel-Mazzetti is one species used of Astragali Radix. In this study, the immunomodulatory properties of H. polybotrys were explored by LPS-activated and SNP-treated RAW 264. 7 cells and splenocytes and, daunoblastina-induced leucopenia BALB/c mice. Formononetin {{was used as the}} bioactive marker to monitor the quality of the H. polybotrys extracts. H. polybotrys was extracted with hot-water and methanol, and MeOH extract partitioned with H 2 O (M-H) and ethyl acetate (M-EA) to yield four different fractions. M-EA had the highest formononetin and total proanthocyanidin content and showed stronger inhibitory effects on the production and expression of NO, PGE 2, iNOS and COX- 2 in LPS-activated RAW 264. 7 cells and splenocytes than the other fractions. In addition, M-EA significantly stimulated the proliferation of LPS-activated RAW 264. 7 cells and splenocytes, enhanced NO radicals scavenging and attenuated NO-induced cytotoxicity.   Furthermore, M-EA also significantly increased the rate of recovery of white blood cells level in daunoblastina-induced leucopenia mice.

40|$|International audienceAn {{in vitro}} {{preparation}} of the crayfish nervous system has been utilized to study an interjoint reflex pathway and its variability during rhythmic locomotor activity. The coxo-basal chordotonal organ (CBCO) is a joint stretch receptor spanning the second joint of walking legs in crayfish, where it encodes joint movements and position. Mechanical stimulation (stretch and release) of the CBCO and electrical stimulation of the CBCO nerve elicits reflex responses in promotor and remotor motor neurons innervating muscles moving the basal thoraco-coxal (TC) leg joint. Promotor and remotor motor neurons receive monosynaptic excitatory inputs from at least four CBCO afferents, including both stretch- and release-sensitive CBCO afferents. In a <b>tonic</b> <b>preparation,</b> {{in which there is}} no tendency to produce alternating bursts of activity in antagonistic motor neurons, the reflex responses were evoked during each cycle of imposed movement. However, when the preparation became rhythmic and produced bouts of fictive locomotion, the reflex responses were unstable and their gain was phasically modulated. Paired recordings indicate that such a modulation of the monosynaptic interjoint reflex could be due to both a phasic change in the excitability of the motor neurons and presynaptic inhibition that reduces the excitatory input from CBCO primary afferents...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is concern}} {{regarding}} the irrational production, prescription {{and use of}} drugs in India. This study aimed to describe the quality of prescriptions by medical practitioners, including both {{the layout of the}} prescription and the type and number of drugs prescribed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey of all prescriptions dispensed at a busy pharmacy in the state of Goa, India, was carried out over a consecutive seven-day period. Each prescription was rated {{on the basis of a}} priori and pilot-tested variable list. The prescriptions by private practitioners were compared with those from practitioners in the public healthcare system. RESULTS: Nine hundred and ninety prescriptions were collected. The majority (83. 9 &#x 0025;) were from private practitioners. The quality of the layout of the prescriptions was unsatisfactory: information to identify the practitioner was incomplete in more than a third of the prescriptions and information to identify the patient was incomplete in more than half. Clarity of written instructions on how to take the medicines was unsatisfactory in the majority of prescriptions. Polypharmacy was the norm, with more than half (52. 7 &#x 0025;) the prescriptions containing at least 3 medicines. Forty per cent of prescriptions included a vitamin or <b>tonic</b> <b>preparation</b> and a quarter of the prescriptions included an antibiotic and an analgesic. Over 90 &#x 0025; of prescriptions contained only branded medicines. Private practitioners prescribed significantly greater number of medicines and were more likely to prescribe vitamins and antibiotics, and branded medicines. DISCUSSION: This study confirms that the quality of prescriptions, both in terms of layout and the content of the drugs prescribed, is inadequate. There is a need to standardize the format of prescriptions in India so that all essential information is included. There is a need to strengthen an independent mechanism for continuing professional development of practitioners to ensure that patients are always given evidence-based, cost-effective treatments...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe crude {{alcoholic}} extracts {{obtained from}} Pterodon pubescens Benth. seeds {{are widely used}} in Brazilian folk medicine as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-rheumatic <b>tonics</b> and depurative <b>preparations.</b> We previously demonstrated the antinociceptive activity on writhing capsaicin, glutamate, and hot-plate tests of two compounds isolated from P. pubescens: geranylgeraniol (C 1) and 6 α, 7 β-dihydroxyvouacapan- 17 β-oate methyl ester (C 2). This work {{is a continuation of}} the previous study investigating the possible mechanisms of action for compounds C 1 and C 2, and the differences between them. The present study demonstrated that when administered intraperitoneally (i. p.) : i), compounds C 1 and C 2 produced significant anti-allodynic activity during the acute phase of the Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) -induced persistent pain model; ii) compound C 1 produced significant anti-hypernociception activity in the carrageenan-induced pain model; iii) compound C 2 presented a significant loss of activity after p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride (PCPA) [5 -HT synthesis inhibitor] treatment, suggesting that the mechanisms of action could be related to either the synthesis or release of serotonin; iv) compound C 1 presented a significant loss of activity after ondansetron (5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist) treatment suggesting activity upon 5 -HT 3 serotonin receptors; v) compound C 1 presented a significant loss of activity after efaroxan (mixed I 1 imidazoline/α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist) treatment suggesting the participation of this compound upon imidazoline I 1 receptors; and vi) both compounds C 1 and C 2 did not appear to exert their activity via 5 -HT 1 A, 5 -HT 2 A, imidazoline I 2, α 2 -adrenoceptor, nitric oxide, GABAA, acetylcholine muscarinic, and nicotinic receptors when evaluated in acetic acid-induced nociception...|$|R
40|$|The {{basis of}} {{locomotion}} is the rhythmic activity of locomotor organs. During walking, rhythmic alternating bursts occur in leg motoneurons which {{result from the}} integration of signals from central pattern generators, sense organs and coordinating signals from neighboring segments. The rhythmic bursting pattern is shaped by rhythmic excitatory and inhibitory drive, {{as well as a}} long lasting (tonic) depolarizing modulation. This dissertation investigates the mechanisms that underlie the tonic modulation of neuronal activity, which is the basis of the rhythmic activity. A single-legged preparation of the stick insect was used, that allows the analysis of neuronal activity in mesothoracic motoneurons during front leg stepping, without the influence of local sense organs. Intracellular recordings of the membrane potential in flexor motoneurons ipsilateral and contralateral to the stepping front leg revealed a mean tonic membrane depolarization of 1. 8 ± 1. 1 mV that could outlast the stepping sequence by several seconds. Furthermore, a phasic modulation of membrane potential occurred on top of the tonic depolarization, which was variably coupled to front leg steps. The tonic depolarization was associated with a decrease in input resistance, its amplitude depended on membrane potential and its mean reversal potential was found to be - 41 mV. These properties of the tonic depolarization indicate that it is based on a nonselective cation conductance or a mixed inward and outward current through different channels. Furthermore, the tonic depolarization increased the excitability of the membrane to depolarizing input and was found to have long repolarization time constants (tau= 800 ms). Pharmacological experiments were performed to identify the participating transmitter(s) and to test for a possible involvement of second messengers. Flexor motoneurons were recorded intracellularly while superfusing pharmacological agents, which were restricted to the mesothoracic ganglion. The muscarinic antagonist atropine decreased the tonic depolarization amplitude, thus indicating a role for acetylcholine in mediating the tonic depolarization via metabotropic receptors. Other transmitters/receptors might be involved too, as octopamine increased the tonic depolarization amplitude. This was supported by the reduction of the tonic depolarization amplitude by an octopaminergic antagonist (mianserin). Serotonin had an opposing effect on the tonic depolarization amplitude. It was shown that serotonin increased, but also decreased the tonic depolarization amplitude in different experiments. Several second messenger pathways might be involved in mediating the tonic depolarization, one of which seems to include calcium in the flexor motoneurons. Furthermore, the increase of the tonic depolarization amplitude by 8 -Br-cAMP suggests a role for cAMP in mediating the tonic depolarization. An involvement of an IP 3 /DAG pathway was indicated by the increase in tonic depolarization in the presence of neomycin and U- 73122. Additional experiments addressed the role of the brain (supraesophageal ganglion) in controlling neuronal activity in the mesothoracic ganglion induced by front leg stepping. Especially the relevance of the brain for generating the tonic depolarization was tested in lesion experiments. Brain removal decreased the tonic depolarization amplitude, thus indicating a role for descending pathways in influencing the <b>tonic</b> depolarization. Another <b>preparation</b> was used to investigate the neuronal activity in neck connectives during front leg stepping. The neuronal activity increased and was correlated to front leg stepping velocity. In brainless animals, however, the increased activity in neck connectives was diminished...|$|R
