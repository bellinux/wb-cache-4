Apart from providing a theoretical framework, Port Competitiveness Model, to future port research, this thesis also aims to identify the major factors affecting port attractiveness, to assess port choice behaviour, to investigate the current port competitiveness and to forecast their future prospects in the market. Research methodology involves various quantitative modelling techniques including generalized cost calculations (to assess port attractiveness), Multinomial Logit Model (to assess port choice behaviours of liners and the current competitive positions of ports) and Logistic Regression (to predict port competitiveness in the future), while data collection includes a questionnaire survey of major liners and various in-depth interviews with port and shipping experts in Europe. Findings indicate that money and time are not sufficient to explain the choices of liners and other less-quantifiable factors like geography, quality of services, values and perceptions, inertia, limitations of liners are also significant. Rotterdam is currently the overall market leader in the North European transhipment market but may be fragile in resisting challenges from competitors while Hamburg is a regional leader in the Scandinavia-Baltic market. On the other hand, Bremerhaven is currently an underachiever but possesses potential if it changes its current competitive strategies while Antwerp also possesses potential but faces different problems in its developments. For poor performing ports like Felixstowe and Le Havre, they need to improve significantly before they can really compete. Also, results suggest that ports should not only focus on expensive physical improvements (like infrastructure) but should also pay attention to software aspects in port operations e. g. management, marketing, etc. The key to achieve port competitiveness does not depend on port's administrative system but on how it executes the system and makes things work. In the foreseeable future, the author firmly believes that this thesis will become one of the theoretical 'pillars' in the theory of port competition. </p...|$|E
50|$|The Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad {{began in}} Philadelphia at Broad and Vine Streets, ran north on Broad and west on Pennsylvania Avenue (a segment later taken over and submerged/tunneled {{over by the}} Reading Railroad), then headed {{northwest}} across the Columbia Bridge over the Schuylkill River. Just after crossing the river, it traveled up the Belmont Plane, an inclined plane in the current location of West Fairmount Park, and continued west across {{the eastern part of}} the state to Columbia, where the Columbia Plane headed down to the Susquehanna River. At that point, the eastern division of the canal was joined to the railroad, allowing <b>transhipment</b> of <b>traffic</b> heading north along the river and then west.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variation}} of overlapping gauge is {{to extend a}} railway of one gauge into territory that is mainly of another gauge {{so as to avoid}} <b>transhipment</b> of specific <b>traffic.</b> For example, a [...] gauge line runs from an iron ore mine in Ukraine to a steelworks in Slovakia, and now may be extended into Austria. Also, there is a portion of four-rail dual gauge 1435 vs. 1520 mm track from Slovakia to Romania (both standard gauge) via Ukraine (Russian gauge).|$|R
5000|$|Although self-proclaimed as a {{relevant}} hub in the Europe-Africa-America maritime freight <b>traffic,</b> <b>transhipment</b> remains {{as the main}} weakness of the Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. According to recent figures, the Port handled in 2011 a total amount of 330.000 TEUS, being the transit a mere testimonial share of it (0,011% of total cargo). Therefore, the Port has been downgraded (when compared to nearby Port of Las Palmas, in the island of Gran Canaria, and excluded from the TEN-T Trans-European Transport Network (selected by the European Commission-based ob quantitative criteria, e.g. handling >1% of total European maritime cargo). However, new developments are expected, following the expansion project of the Dársena del Este and the concession for container handling operations extended to OHL.|$|R
40|$|U radu se na temelju arhivskih izvora i relevantne {{literature}} prikazuje niz pokušaja trgovišta Vukovara u svezi izgradnje željezničke pruge u razdoblju 1850. - 1914., donosi političke i društvene okolnosti koje su onemogućavale izgradnju željeznice, koja je bila nužna za prometno i trgovačko povezivanje Vukovara, te podateke o postupnoj i djelomičnoj realizaciji željezničke mreže na vukovarskom području. In {{the text}} the author describes {{a great number}} of attempts of the market Vukovar to construct a railway and attempts an explanation of the political and social circumstances that made possible the construction of the railway that was necessary for the traffic and trade connections of Vukovar. From 1841, when the Hungarian radicals pleaded for a direct connection between the Hungarian centre and the Adriatic Sea, Vukovar was part of the plans and ground plans for the railway construction, which were partially put into practice in 1878 when the connection between Budapest and Bosnia was accomplished with the construction of the Dalj- Vinkovci-Brod railway. During the same year Vukovar got its first railway connection via Borovo and Dalj as it became connected to Budapest via Sombor and Northern Bačka. The Vukovar-Borovo railway station was built in 1879, when the section from Vinkovci was extended from Borovo to the Vukovar-Priljevo railway station, that is, up to the banks of the Danube. It was extended as far as the town itself in 1891, and after that, around the town, to the Old Vukovar-Market railway station only in 1912. With the construction of the railway Vukovar in some way lost its privileged position of being the largest port on the Danube, but it still remained an important communications centre for <b>transhipment.</b> The new <b>traffic</b> situation had contributed to the isolation of Vukovar and restricted production capacities, which had remained exclusively at the local level during the whole of 19 th century...|$|R
