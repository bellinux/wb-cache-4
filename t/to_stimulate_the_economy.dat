5|$|Having {{been elected}} twice to the presidency, Reagan {{reshaped}} the Republican party, led the modern conservative movement, and altered the political {{dynamic of the}} United States. His 1980 presidential campaign stressed some of his fundamental principles: lower taxes <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> less government interference in people's lives, states' rights, and a strong national defense.|$|E
5|$|The 1980 presidential {{election}} featured Reagan against incumbent President Jimmy Carter and was conducted amid {{a multitude of}} domestic concerns {{as well as the}} ongoing Iran hostage crisis. Reagan's campaign stressed some of his fundamental principles: lower taxes <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> less government interference in people's lives, states' rights, and a strong national defense.|$|E
5|$|The Bush {{campaign}} advertised {{across the}} U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and {{accused him of}} failing <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and {{increase the size of}} government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq, and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.|$|E
50|$|As a congressman, some of Hobson's primary {{concerns}} were improving health care, controlling {{government spending and}} balancing the budget, and strengthening national security. Hobson also believed that Congress must help <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economies</b> of former industrial towns who have seen factories leave.|$|R

50|$|LETS {{can help}} {{revitalise}} and build community by allowing a wider cross-section of the community—individuals, small businesses, local services and voluntary groups—to {{save money and}} resources in cooperation with others and extend their purchasing power. Other benefits may include social contact, health care, tuition and training, support for local enterprise and new businesses. One goal {{of this approach is}} <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economies</b> of economically depressed towns that have goods and services, but little official currency: the LETS scheme does not require outside sources of income as stimulus.|$|R
5|$|The Great Depression, {{although}} negative to {{the local}} economy, also benefited the San Diego State Teachers College, {{as the federal government}} made money available for construction projects in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> For the campus, some of these construction projects included new buildings (such as a $500,000 stadium completed in 1936 and a $200,000 open air theater completed in 1941), facilities, and art works. Several federal programs were also created to give jobs to students and to increase financial aid.|$|E
5|$|There were fears {{among some}} traders in India that Indian goods {{would find a}} limited outlet in Tibet, while China would {{have access to a}} ready market in Sikkim and West Bengal. The reopening of the pass was {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> of the region and bolster Indo-Chinese trade, but this has not happened. Figures released by the Tibet Autonomous Regional Bureau of Commerce show that in the 51 days of trading in 2006, only US$186,250 worth of trade passed through Nathu La.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival in}} New Orleans of Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie {{as the new}} {{governor}} of Louisiana in June 1763 led to changes in colonial policies. D'Abbadie quickly moved to grant trade monopolies in the middle Mississippi Valley <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> Among the new monopolists was Pierre Laclede, who along with his stepson Auguste Chouteau set out in August 1763 to build a fur trading post near {{the confluence of the}} Missouri and Mississippi rivers. The settlement of St. Louis was established at a site south of the confluence on {{the west bank of the}} Mississippi on February 15, 1764, by Chouteau and a group of about 30 men. Laclede arrived at the site by mid-1764 and provided detailed plans for the village, including a street grid and market area.|$|E
50|$|The College of the Atlantic was {{conceived}} by Mount Desert Island residents who wanted <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> island's <b>economy</b> during <b>the</b> off-season, when revenue from tourism declined, by forming a year-round, four-year {{institution of higher}} education.|$|R
50|$|During {{the rule}} of Emperor Wu, China entered an era of prosperity. The Jin {{encouraged}} recovery by lowering taxes and subsidizing the construction of dikes and other works to benefit agriculture. The reunification of China also spurred on trade <b>to</b> help <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The city {{government}} provides many services and jobs <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> local <b>economy,</b> including water, electric, garbage collection, and {{waste water treatment}} facilities. In addition, a professional police and volunteer fire department are provided. The City of Philippi was voted as a 2004 [...] "All American City".|$|R
5|$|With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer, {{government}} deficits ceased: {{the budget}} showed a surplus in {{every year from}} 1925 until 1930, except for 1927. In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was {{on the cusp of}} a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes, in part by creating a new income tax. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending. His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> than to a belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that could reasonably be raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure.|$|E

50|$|The part of {{this water}} that was {{situated}} in the centre of Drachten, was closed in the sixties of the last century, in order <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> local <b>economy</b> and give space to the increased road traffic.

40|$|The {{topic of}} these {{considerations}} concerns {{the development of}} trade and economic relations between the European Union and the People’s Republic of China. Their purpose is to indicate new phenomena in these relations. Analysis has shown that mutual economic relations {{in the first decade}} of the 21 st century expanded considerably on account of common interests. The economic crisis at the turn of the first decade of the 21 st century inspired plans <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economies</b> of both parties, and tighten mutual relations. On both sides there are the conditions and prerequisites to further develop and intensify broad economic cooperation. The Chinese competitive challenge, resulting from its dynamic development, is particularly topical and important for the prospects of the European Union’s global position...|$|R
50|$|Investing {{in public}} works {{projects}} in order <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> general <b>economy</b> has been a popular policy measure since the economic crisis of the 1930s.

25|$|After his {{handling}} of the economic effects of 9/11, Alan Greenspan became more important, and {{in the wake of the}} Enron scandal he cut interest rates in a bid <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> Unusually, this ostensibly failed to cause inflation. It seemed the New Economy was working to stabilise the economy.|$|E
50|$|The town still {{supports}} the lumber industry, but coal {{has given way}} to natural gas. It now also features several small and medium-sized businesses and some significant manufacturing operations.

50|$|In early October 2010, the Bank of Japan {{announced}} that it would examine the purchase of ¥5 trillion (US$60 billion) in assets.

25|$|Despite {{the double}} boom in tourism in the 1950s and 1960s, Tasmania's {{geographic}} isolation deterred the craved {{foreign investment in}} industry that was needed <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> and the government was constantly dealing with economic fluctuations. Hobart went through short periods of building booms, followed by longer stagnations, a cycle that continued into the 1990s.|$|E

Tom Cox for the Libertarian party and two write in candidates, Richard Alevizos and Gary Spanovich, also stood in the election.|$|E
25|$|Romá y Rosell {{had been}} chosen by José de Gálvez, {{secretary}} of the Council of the Indies, for two important tasks. The first was {{the introduction of the}} judicial reforms, and the second was <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> of the colony. However, he was inexperienced in colonial administration, and did not maintain close contact with Gálvez. He was replaced in 1782 by Vicente Herrera. Romá died in 1784.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the United States, where Franklin Roosevelt's inflationary New Deal {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> American <b>economy,</b> New Zealand where Michael Savage's pioneering {{welfare state}} tried to reduce hardship, or the United Kingdom where rearmament (from 1936) increased deficit spending, {{there was no}} significant mechanism for inflationary Keynesian economic policy responses in Australia.|$|R
5000|$|Sports media {{channels}} such as ESPN and Fox Sports, as well {{as sports}} magazines like Sports Illustrated, are assumed {{to appeal to a}} predominantly male audience.

40|$|In {{this period}} of {{economic}} uncertainty, tax scholars must examine income tax policy from a macroeconomic perspective. The standard lenses of efficiency and equity no longer suffice. To highlight {{the importance of the}} macroeconomic perspective, this Article demonstrates that most tax expenditures are procyclical, exacerbating the business cycle. Tax expenditures effectively offer government subsidies for certain activities, such as charitable giving or home purchases. Because these activities vary with the business cycle, tax expenditures are higher at business cycle peaks than at business cycle troughs. The more a given activity varies in tandem with the business cycle, the greater the procyclicality of the tax expenditure. While recent income tax and government spending policies have been explicitly devoted <b>to</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> <b>the</b> destabilizing impact of tax expenditures quietly negate much of the impact of fiscal stimulus measures. Our inability to discern tax expenditures 2 ̆ 7 hidden destabilizing impact is symptomatic of a general neglect of macroeconomics in income tax policy. To avoid introducing and perpetuating further destabilizing forces into the current era of general economic uncertainty, macroeconomic perspectives should assume a more prominent place in tax policy discourse...|$|R
25|$|Following President Roosevelt's {{election}} Congress quickly {{enacted the}} National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> Among other provisions it authorized the Public Works Administrator, Secretary of the Interior Harold L.

25|$|His {{conservative}} economic approach won him {{support among}} business, but angered {{many in the}} Labor caucus, who wanted to expand the deficit <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> and were horrified {{at the prospect of}} cuts in salaries and government spending. Alienated by their attacks, Lyons began to consider suggestions from a group of his new business supporters, including influential members of the Melbourne Establishment, that he leave the government to take over the leadership of the conservative opposition.|$|E
25|$|MacDonald's {{government}} had no effective {{response to the}} economic crisis which followed the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Philip Snowden was a rigid exponent of orthodox finance and would not permit any deficit spending <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> despite the urgings of Oswald Mosley, David Lloyd George and the economist John Maynard Keynes. Mosley put forward a memorandum in January 1930, calling for the public control of imports and banking {{as well as an}} increase in pensions to boost spending power. When this was repeatedly turned down, Mosley resigned from the government in February 1931 and formed the New Party. He later converted to Fascism.|$|E
