5|$|Patagonia {{is located}} between the {{subtropical}} high pressure belt, and the subpolar low pressure zone, meaning it {{is exposed to}} westerly winds that are strong, since south of 40o S, there is little land to block these winds. Being located between the semipermanent South Pacific and the South Atlantic Highs at around 30oS, and the Subpolar Low at arount 60o S, {{the movement of the}} high and low pressure systems, along with ocean currents, determine the precipitation pattern. During winter, both the South Pacific and South Atlantic highs move to the north, while the Subpolar Low strengthens, which, when combined with higher ocean temperatures than the surrounding land, results in higher precipitation during <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> Due to the northward migration of the South Pacific High, more frontal systems can pass through, allowing for more precipitation to occur. During summer, the South Pacific High migrates southward, preventing the passage of fronts, and cyclones that can cause precipitation to occur, resulting in lower precipitation during <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> Northeastern areas, along with southern parts of the region, are influenced by air masses from the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in precipitation being more evenly distributed throughout the year. Most precipitation comes from frontal systems, particularly stationary fronts that bring humid air from the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|To {{the sailors}} {{who visited the}} Mascarene islands from 1598 onwards, the fauna was mainly {{interesting}} from a culinary standpoint. Of the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet has survived. The others likely all vanished due {{to a combination of}} extensive hunting and deforestation. Due to being easily caught, the Mascarene grey parakeet was often hunted in abundance by early visitors to Mauritius and Réunion. As they fattened themselves from June to September, they were particularly sought after at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> An account by Admiral Steven van der Hagen from 1606 even suggests that the grey parrots of Mauritius were sometimes killed for amusement.|$|E
25|$|Inflow {{starts in}} May/June with maximum rates of flow of around 10,000 m3/s by late August and ends in October/November, amplified by {{precipitation}} {{of the annual}} monsoon. In November the lake reaches its maximum size. The annual monsoon coincides to cease around <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> As the Mekong river begins its minimum around <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> and its water level falls deeper than the inundated Tonle Sap lake, Tonle Sap river and surrounding wetlands, waters of the lake's basin now drains via the Tonle Sap river into the Mekong. As a result the Tonle Sap River (length around 115km/71mi) flows 6 months a year South-East (Mekong) to North-West (lake) and 6 month {{a year in the}} opposite direction. The mean annual reverse flow volume in the Tonle Sap is , or about half of the maximum lake volume. A further 10% is estimated to enter the system by overland flow from the Mekong. The Mekong branches off into several arms near Phnom Penh and reaches Vietnamese territory south of Koh Thom and Loek Daek districts of Kandal Province.|$|E

500|$|One genre {{regularly}} {{mentioned in}} connection with the dump months is horror.

500|$|Another popular festival held in Chamba is the [...] "Minjar Mela", held on {{the second}} Sunday of the Shravana month, {{corresponding}} to the month of August in the Gregorian calendar. It marks {{the triumph of the}} Raja of Chamba over the ruler of Trigarta (now called as Kangra), in 935 AD and also celebrates the paddy and maize crops grown at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> The festival commences with offerings of 'minjar', consisting of a bunch of paddy plant and golden silk wrapped in red fabric. The offerings also include a rupee, a seasonal fruit, and a coconut. This occasion is also celebrated with a flag hoisting ceremony at the Chaugan that initiates a week of cultural and social programmes. The image of the deity, Lord Raghuvira, and more than 200 other deities, are taken in a procession, in a chariot pulled by ropes. Folk dances and music performances known as 'Kunjari Malhar' are part of the festivities. On {{the last day of the}} festival, a parade is held from the Akhand Chandi Palace to Ravi River, where offerings are made to the river. This commemorates an event in which Raja Sahil Verman changed the course of the river, to make the Hari Rai temple accessible to all devotees.|$|E

2500|$|Psalm 27, {{which is}} recited in most {{communities}} twice daily {{starting at the}} beginning of Elul, continues to be recited on Shemini Atzeret outside of the Land of Israel. When Shemini Atzeret falls on the Shabbat, the Scroll of Ecclesiastes, or Kohelet ( [...] , otherwise read in Ashkenazi synagogues on the Shabbat of Sukkot), is read on that day outside of the Land of Israel. In the Land of Israel, it would have been read {{on the first day of}} Sukkot, which would also have been on Shabbat. The Torah reading (Deuteronomy 14:22–16:17) is the same as on the Final Day of Passover and Second Day of Shavuot. However, unlike Passover and Shavuot, the full length of the Torah reading is included on Shemini Atzeret even when the day does not fall on the Shabbat because the reading refers to separation of agricultural gifts (like tithes and terumah), which are due at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> The Haftarah describes the people's blessing of King Solomon at the end of the dedication of the First Temple.|$|E
2500|$|Aberdeen {{features}} an oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb). Aberdeen has far milder winter temperatures {{than one might}} expect for its northern location, although statistically it is the coldest city in the UK. During the winter, especially throughout December, {{the length of the}} day is very short, averaging 6 hours and 41 minutes between sunrise and sunset at winter solstice. As winter progresses, the length of the day grows fairly quickly, to 8 hours and 20 minutes by the end of January. Around summer solstice, the days will be around 18 hours long, having 17 hours and 55 minutes between sunrise and sunset. During <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> marginal nautical twilight lasts the entire night. Temperatures {{at this time of year}} will be typically hovering around [...] during the day in most of the urban area, though nearer [...] directly on the coast, and around [...] in the westernmost suburbs, illustrating the cooling effect of the North Sea during summer. In addition, from June onward skies are more overcast than in April/May, as reflected in a lower percentage of possible sunshine (the percentage of daylight hours that are sunny). These factors render summer to be very temperate by European standards.|$|E
