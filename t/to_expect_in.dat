25|$|Unlike in burlesque theater, {{the modern}} popular form of strip theater can {{minimize}} {{the interaction of}} customer and dancer, reducing the importance of tease in the performance in favor of speed to undress. Most clubs have a dancer rotation where each dancer in turn will perform for one or more songs in a fixed sequence which repeats during a shift. Less formal clubs will have dancers take turns when a stage becomes empty or have a free flow of entertainers where the stage has any number of entertainers who wander off and on at will. Featured entertainers are not usually part of the rotation and they generally have set times when they will perform that are advertised throughout the shift. If a DJ is present, {{he or she will}} emcee the rotation and typically announce the current dancer(s) on stage and possibly whom <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>in</b> future sets.|$|E
500|$|... "Callie and Her Sister" [...] {{was written}} by Mick Kelly, in his second writing credit for the series, {{following}} the [...] finale [...] "The Manbirds". The episode was directed by series creator Devin Clark and Richard Ferguson-Hull. [...] "Callie and Her Sister" [...] marked Ferguson-Hull's first directing credit for the series; he previously served as a director for the Adult Swim animated series Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law (2000–07). In addition to the main cast, [...] "Callie and Her Sister" [...] features appearances by recurring guest voice actors Pete Holmes, Julie Klausner and Mike O'Gorman. Klausner provided the voices of Lilith and Rosie, and main cast member Larry Murphy returned to voice Callie's father Aldermach. [...] "Callie and Her Sister" [...] was first hinted at in June 2011 during an interview by Clark on what <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>in</b> the series' second season, where he revealed the episode's main plot and its references: [...] "Callie's parents get back together in one episode and {{give birth to a}} sister for Callie who because of being a supernatural creature, ends up aging one year, every day, and we have an homage to The Omen in there. Mark and Callie end up taking over the responsibilities of her parenting dealing with this demonic child." ...|$|E

2500|$|Both {{concepts}} of the renormalization group can be considered in quantum theories constructed using the front form of dynamics. The first concept allows one {{to play with a}} small set of parameters and seek consistency, which is a useful strategy in perturbation theory if one knows from other approaches what <b>to</b> <b>expect.</b> <b>In</b> particular, one may study new perturbative features that appear in the front form of dynamics, since it differs from the instant form. The main difference is that the front variables [...] (or [...] ) are considerably different from the transverse variables [...] (or [...] ), so that there is no simple rotational symmetry among them.|$|E

[...] Unlike earlier segregated hotels and boarding houses, the Somerville (and later the Dunbar) offered luxury amenities – a restaurant, cocktail lounge and barbershop. One person noted, [...] "The Dunbar symbolizes luxury and respect even in the worst of times."

2500|$|Some {{members of}} the {{audience}} considered it immoral to portray scenes of violence; the Dean of Durham protested [...] "against an entertainment which wounds the heart and violates the very sanctity of bereavement". Others complained that such a serious film shared the cinema programme with comedy films. On 28 August, the Yorkshire Evening Post printed the comment, attributed to Lloyd George, [...] "If the exhibition of this Picture all over the world does not end War, God help civilisation". The film was shown to British troops in France from 5 September; Lieutenant-Colonel Rowland Feilding, an officer who saw the film in a muddy field near Morlancourt, described it as [...] "a wonderful and most realistic production" [...] but criticised the film for failing to record the sound of rifles and machine-guns, although there was an artillery accompaniment from guns firing nearby. Feilding suggested that the film could reassure new recruits, by giving them some idea of what <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>in</b> battle; the intertitles were forthright, describing images of injury and death.|$|E
2500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. In his review for IGN, contributor Colin Moriarty {{stated that the}} episode was [...] "as strong as we've come <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>in</b> recent weeks" [...] and called it [...] "undeniably fun to watch and {{has the ability to}} get a laugh out of you even if you're in the worst of moods". Moriarty praised the chemistry that was developing between the actors, and hoped that [...] "all of the characters will get more involved to really see where they are all going". He hoped that the show [...] "ends on the high note it's been reaching towards rather than heading towards a decrescendo that hurts many a promising show" [...] and added that [...] "in the meantime, check out this episode for a good laugh, and wait patiently for the culmination of the first season". Overall, the installment was given a rating of 8, or [...] "great", tying it for the best rated episode of the show {{at the time of the}} review; it was rated as being equal to the preceding episode, [...] "Weekend Warriors".|$|E
2500|$|Prior {{to public}} release, Meirelles {{screened}} Blindness to test audiences. He described {{the impact of}} test screenings: [...] "If {{you know how to}} use it, how to ask the right questions, it can be really useful." [...] A test screening of Meirelles' first cut in Toronto resulted in ten percent of the audience, nearly 50 people, walking out of the film early. Meirelles ascribed the problem to a rape scene that takes place partway through the film, and edited the scene to be much shorter in the final cut. Meirelles explained his goal, [...] "When I shot and edited these scenes, I did it in a very technical way, I worried about how to light it and so on, and I lost the sense of their brutality. Some women were really angry with the film, and I thought, 'Wow, maybe I crossed the line.' I went back not to please the audience but so they would stay involved {{until the end of the}} story." [...] He also found that a New York City test screening expressed concern about a victim in the film failing to take revenge. Meirelles believed this concern to reflect what Americans have learned <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>in</b> their cinema.|$|E

2500|$|Subsequent {{releases}} in the 1970s {{also did}} {{well on the}} charts and in ongoing sales, although they did not touch the success he had from 1970 to 1973. In 1973, Stevens moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as a tax exile from the United Kingdom, however, he later donated the money to UNESCO. During that time he created the album Foreigner, which was {{a departure from the}} music that had brought him to the height of his fame. It differed in several respects: entirely written by Stevens, he dropped his band and produced the record without the assistance of Samwell-Smith, who had played a large role in catapulting him to fame, and with the exception of some guitar on the title track and [...] "100 I Dream", he played keyboard instruments throughout the album. It was intended to show a funk/soul element rising in popularity that Stevens had come to appreciate. One side of Foreigner was continuous, much different from the radio-friendly pop tunes fans had come <b>to</b> <b>expect.</b> <b>In</b> November 1973 he performed side two of the album at the Aquarius Theater in Hollywood, with a pre-arranged uninterrupted quadraphonic simulcast on the ABC network. The show was titled the [...] "Moon and Star" [...] concert. This performance did include his band, but they were all but overshadowed by an orchestra. The album produced a couple of singles including [...] "The Hurt", but did not reach the heights he had once enjoyed.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 6 December, four MiG-21s from No. 28 Squadron, flying from Gauhati {{under the command of}} Wing Commander B. K. Bishnoi at very low level, climbed up to 5,000 meters {{altitude}} and then dived at 900km/h, hitting Tejgaon airstrip with 500kg. bombs, scoring several hits on the runway and rendering it unusable for operations. The airport was without air cover at that time, as a PAF ground support mission had just landed and the duty flight had not yet taken off. Two craters, each ten meters deep and twenty meters wide and separated by 1200 meters, had rendered the runway unusable (the bombs were BETAB-500, anti-airstrip ordnance). However, Kurmitola was to remain operational until {{the morning of}} 7 December, when Mig-21s of No. 28 Squadron again hit that runway. Although No. 7 Squadron was pulled out of the eastern operations on 6 December to help the army in the west, repeated attacks by MiG-21s and Hunters of No. 14 and No.28 Squadrons kept the runway cratered. An aviation website stated, [...] "A notable fact remains that the MiG-21FL was neither as easy to fly nor to operate in combat under conditions the IAF had <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>in</b> the case of a new war with Pakistan. It was designed as simple point-defense fighter-interceptor that was to operate under close GCI-control and attack its targets from the rear hemisphere with R-3S (ASCC-Code AA-2 Atoll) heat-seeking missiles. However, pleased with the speed and handling of the MiGs during operational conversions, Indian pilots trained intensively and gained not only considerable confidence, but also expertise. The Indians were to use it as an air superiority fighter as well as fighter bomber over extended ranges and well inside the enemy airspace, with minimal or no GCI-support at all." ...|$|E
