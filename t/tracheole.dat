5000|$|... == Structure of the tracheae == After {{passing through}} a spiracle, air enters a {{longitudinal}} tracheal trunk, eventually diffusing throughout a complex, branching network of tracheal tubes that subdivides into smaller and smaller diameters and reaches {{every part of the}} body. At the end of each tracheal branch, a special cell (the <b>tracheole)</b> provides a thin, moist interface for the exchange of gasses between atmospheric air and a living cell. Oxygen in the tracheal tube first dissolves in the liquid of the <b>tracheole</b> and then diffuses into the cytoplasm of an adjacent cell.

2500|$|Most insects breath passively {{through their}} spiracles (special {{openings}} in the exoskeleton) and the air reaches {{every part of the}} body by means of a series of smaller and smaller tubes called 'trachaea' when their diameters are relatively large, and 'tracheoles' when their diameters are very small. The <b>tracheoles</b> make contact with individual cells throughout the body. They are partially filled with fluid, which can be withdrawn from the individual <b>tracheoles</b> when the tissues, such as muscles, [...] are active and have a high demand for oxygen, bringing the air closer to the active cells. This is probably brought about by the buildup of lactic acid in the active muscles causing an osmotic gradient, moving the water out of the <b>tracheoles</b> and into the active cells. [...] Diffusion of gases is effective over small distances but not over larger ones, {{this is one of the}} reasons insects are all relatively small. Insects which do not have spiracles and trachaea, such as some Collembola, breathe directly through their skins, also by diffusion of gases.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the larger}} tracheae which are derived of {{ectodermal}} stem cells, <b>tracheoles</b> do not molt with the insect. Instead, they {{remain in place}} and fuse themselves to new tracheae at each molt by a cement they produce.|$|R

50|$|The {{muscular system}} of insects ranges {{from a few}} hundred muscles to a few thousand. Unlike {{vertebrates}} that have both smooth and striated muscles, insects have only striated muscles. Muscle cells are amassed into muscle fibers {{and then into the}} functional unit, the muscle.

The sarcolemma is invaginated and can make contact with the <b>tracheole</b> carrying oxygen to the muscle fiber.

5|$|Like most insects, beetles inhale air, for {{the oxygen}} it contains, and exhale carbon dioxide, via a {{tracheal}} system.

5|$|In {{the earlier}} stages of its development, the wing-bud is not {{provided}} with special organs of respiration such as tracheation, as it resembles {{in this respect}} the other portions of the hypodermis {{of which it is}} still a part. It should be noted, however, that the histoblast is developed near a large trachea, a cross-section of which is shown in, which represents sections of these parts of the first, second, third and fourth instars respectively. At the same time the <b>tracheoles</b> uncoil, and extend in bundles in the forming vein-cavities of the wing-bud.

40|$|Taylor and Weibel's {{theory of}} symmorphosis predicts that {{structures}} of the respiratory system are matched to maximum functional requirements with minimal excess capacity. We tested this hypothesis in the respiratory system of the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, by comparing the aerobic capacity of the jumping muscles with the morphology of the oxygen cascade in the hopping legs using an intraspecific allometric analysis of different body mass (M(b)) at selected juvenile life stages. The maximum oxygen consumption rate of the hopping muscle during jumping exercise scales as M(b) (1. 02 ± 0. 02), which parallels the scaling of mitochondrial volume in the hopping muscle, M(b) (1. 02 ± 0. 08), and the total surface area of inner mitochondrial membrane, M(b) (0. 99 ± 0. 10). Likewise, at the oxygen supply end of the insect respiratory system, there is congruence between the aerobic capacity of the hopping muscle and the total volume of <b>tracheoles</b> in the hopping muscle, M(b) (0. 99 ± 0. 16), the total inner surface area of the <b>tracheoles,</b> M(b) (0. 99 ± 0. 16), and the anatomical radial diffusing capacity of the <b>tracheoles,</b> M(b) (0. 99 ± 0. 18).

50|$|Unlike the {{invertebrates}} groups mentioned so far, {{insects are}} usually terrestrial, and exchange gases across a moist surface in {{direct contact with}} the atmosphere, rather than in contact with surrounding water. The insect's exoskeleton is impermeable to gases, including water vapor, so they have a more specialised gas exchange system, requiring gases to be directly transported to the tissues via a complex network of tubes. This respiratory system is separated from their circulatory system. Gases enter and leave the body through openings called spiracles, located laterally along the thorax and abdomen. Similar to plants, insects are able to control the opening and closing of these spiracles, but instead of relying on turgor pressure, they rely on muscle contractions. These contractions result in an insect's abdomen being pumped in and out. The spiracles are connected to tubes called tracheae, which branch repeatedly and ramify into the insect's body. These branches terminate in specialised <b>tracheole</b> cells which provides a thin, moist surface for efficient gas exchange, directly with cells.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the tracheal system becomes filled with air is reviewed. It is concluded that the fluid contents are actively absorbed by {{the walls of the}} system. The air often enters from the atmosphere through the spiracles. In some insects the system fills while the insect is submerged in water or while the spiracles are closed. It is shown by means of simple models how the tanning of the lining of the larger tracheae or the secretion of wax over the walls will bring about the liberation of gas from solution when the fluid is subjected to a very slight negative pressure. The movements of fluid in the <b>tracheole</b> endings of insects are also reviewed. The removal of fluid which takes place during activity, particularly under conditions of deficient oxygen supply, is not caused by secretory activity but by the physical forces produced by the products of metabolism. The evidence supports the view that the fluid in the tracheoles is a cell sap whose passage up the <b>tracheole</b> under the action of capillarity is opposed by the elasticity or swelling pressure of the cytoplasmic sheath of the tracheoles. It is shown by means of a simple gelatin model how osmotic changes in the surrounding fluid, acting by wa...|$|E
40|$|Weibel and Taylor's {{theory of}} symmorphosis {{predicts that the}} {{structural}} components of the respiratory system are quantitatively adjusted to satisfy, but not exceed, an animal's maximum requirement for oxygen. We tested this in the respiratory system of the adult migratory locust Locusta migratoria by comparing the aerobic capacity of hopping and flight muscle with the morphology of the oxygen cascade. Maximum oxygen uptake by flight muscle during tethered flight is 967 ± 76 μmol h(- 1) g(- 1) (body mass specific, ± 95 % confidence interval CI), whereas the hopping muscles consume a maximum of 158 ± 8 μmol h(- 1) g(- 1) during jumping. The 6. 1 -fold difference in aerobic capacity between the two muscles is matched by a 6. 4 -fold difference in <b>tracheole</b> lumen volume, which is 3. 5 × 10 (8) ± 1. 2 × 10 (8) μm(3) g(- 1) in flight muscle and 5. 5 × 10 (7) ± 1. 8 × 10 (7) μm(3) g(- 1) in the hopping muscles, a 6. 4 -fold difference in <b>tracheole</b> inner cuticle surface area, which is 3. 2 × 10 (9) ± 1. 1 × 10 (9) μm(2) g(- 1) in flight muscle and 5. 0 × 10 (8) ± 1. 7 × 10 (8) μm(2) g(- 1) in the hopping muscles, and a 6. 8 -fold difference in <b>tracheole</b> radial diffusing capacity, which is 113 ± 47 μmol kPa(- 1) h(- 1) g(- 1) in flight muscle and 16. 7 ± 6. 5 μmol kPa(- 1) h(- 1) g(- 1) in the hopping muscles. However, there is little congruence between the 6. 1 -fold difference in aerobic capacity and the 19. 8 -fold difference in mitochondrial volume, which is 3. 2 × 10 (10) ± 3. 9 × 10 (9) μm(3) g(- 1) in flight muscle and only 1. 6 × 10 (9) ± 1. 4 × 10 (8) μm(3) g(- 1) in the hopping muscles.

The longer viral tenure within the midgut and the slower progression of systemic infections within H. virescens ultimately contributed to its longer time to death. For 40 -inoculated H. virescens, proportions of lacZ-expressing larvae increased from 18 hpi until {{the onset of the}} molt to the fifth instar at 36 bpi; at this time point, the proportion of signaling insects equaled the final larval mortality.

We used a piggyBac-based vector with a 3 xP 3 -DsRed transformation marker to generate a reporter construct; this construct was used to determine the expression patterns driven by the BmNPV ie 1 promoter; we performed a detailed investigation of the promoter in transgene expression pattern in Drosophila melanogaster and in B. mori.

5|$|Like other insects, {{cockroaches}} breathe {{through a}} system of tubes called tracheae which are attached to openings called spiracles on all body segments.

50|$|Until recently, insect {{respiration}} {{was believed}} to occur entirely by simple diffusion.

40|$|ArticleGas {{exchange}} {{dynamics in}} insects is of fundamental importance to understanding evolved variation in breathing patterns, such as discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGCs). Most insects do not {{rely solely on}} diffusion for the exchange of respiratory gases but may also make use of respiratory movements (active ventilation) to supplement gas exchange at rest. However, their temporal dynamics have not been widely investigated. Here, intratracheal pressure, V̇ CO 2 and body movements of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria were measured simultaneously during the DGC and revealed several important aspects of gas exchange dynamics. First, S. gregaria employs two different ventilatory strategies, one involving dorso-ventral contractions and the other longitudinal telescoping movements. Second, although a true spiracular closed (C) -phase of the DGC could be identified by means of subatmospheric intratracheal pressure recordings, some CO 2 continued to be released. Third, strong pumping actions do not necessarily lead to CO 2 release and {{could be used to}} ensure mixing of gases in the closed tracheal system, or enhance water vapour reabsorption into the haemolymph from fluid-filled <b>tracheole</b> tips by increasing the hydrostatic pressure or forcing fluid into the haemocoel.

40|$|Background: The {{analysis}} of complex networks both {{in general and}} in particular as pertaining to real biological systems {{has been the focus}} of intense scientific attention in the past and present. In this paper we introduce two tools that provide fast and efficient means for the processing and quantification of biological networks like Drosophila <b>tracheoles</b> or leaf venation patterns: the Network Extraction Tool (NET) to extract data and the Graph-edit-GUI (GeGUI) to visualize and modify networks. Results: NET is especially designed for high-throughput semi-automated {{analysis of}} biological datasets containing digital images of networks. The framework starts with the segmentation of the image and then proceeds to vectorization using methodologies from optical character recognition. After a series of steps to clean and improve the quality of the extracted data the framework produces a graph in which the network is represented only by its nodes and neighborhood-relations. The final output contains information about the adjacency matrix of the graph, the width of the edges and the positions of the nodes in space. NET also provides tools for statistical analysis of the network properties, such as the number of nodes or total network length. Other, more complex metrics can be calculated by importing the vectorized network to specialized network analysis packages. GeGUI is designed to facilitate manual correction of non-planar networks as these may contain artifacts or spurious junctions due to branches crossing each other. It is tailored for but not limited to the processing of networks from microscopy images of Drosophila <b>tracheoles.</b> Conclusion: The networks extracted by NET closely approximate the network depicted in the original image. NET is fast, yields reproducible results and is able to capture the full geometry of the network, including curved branches.
