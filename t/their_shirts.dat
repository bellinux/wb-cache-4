5|$|Albion players – {{along with}} those of other Football League teams – first wore numbers on the back of <b>their</b> <b>shirts</b> in the {{abandoned}} season of 1939–40, and names on the back of <b>their</b> <b>shirts</b> from 1999–2000. Red numbers were added to the side of Albion players' shorts in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Footballers {{generally}} wear identifying {{numbers on}} the backs of <b>their</b> <b>shirts.</b> Originally a team of players wore numbers from 1 to 11, corresponding roughly to their playing positions, but at the professional level this has generally been superseded by squad numbering, whereby each player in a squad is allocated a fixed number for the duration of a season. Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on <b>their</b> <b>shirts,</b> above (or, infrequently, below) their squad numbers.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} whistle, {{there was a}} pitch {{invasion}} by Celtic fans, which meant that the Celtic team could not be presented the trophy on the pitch. Some of the Celtic players also had <b>their</b> <b>shirts</b> taken by Celtic supporters. Celtic captain Billy McNeill had to be ushered around {{the outside of the}} stadium under armed guards to receive the trophy on a podium in the stand.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s clubs {{began to}} create {{strongly}} individual strips, and in 1975 Leeds United, who had changed their traditional {{blue and gold}} colours to all white in the 1960s to mimic Real Madrid, became the first club to design shirts which could be sold to fans {{in the form of}} replicas. Driven by commercial concerns, other clubs soon followed suit, adding manufacturers' logos and a higher level of trim. In 1973, German team Eintracht Braunschweig signed a deal with local alcohol producer Jägermeister to display its logo on the front of <b>their</b> <b>shirts.</b> Soon almost all major clubs had signed such deals, and the cost to companies who sponsor large teams has increased dramatically. In 2008 German club FC Bayern Munich received €25 million in sponsorship money from Deutsche Telekom. However Spanish clubs FC Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao refused to allow sponsors' logos to appear on <b>their</b> <b>shirts</b> as recently as 2005. Until 2011 Barcelona refused paying sponsors in favour of wearing the UNICEF logo on <b>their</b> <b>shirts</b> while donating €1.5 million to the charity per year. Players also began to sign sponsorship deals with individual companies. In 1974 Johan Cruijff refused to wear the Dutch national team's strip as its Adidas branding conflicted with his own individual contract with Puma, and was permitted to wear a version without the Adidas branding. Puma had also paid Pelé $120,000 to wear their boots and specifically requested that he bend down and tie his laces {{at the start of the}} 1970 FIFA World Cup final, ensuring a close-up of the boots for a worldwide television audience.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{played in}} red and white shirts in an FA Cup final for the first time, on {{previous}} occasions in 1930 and 32 they wore fully red shirts. Additionally, before the 1967/68 season, Arsenal only wore team badges on <b>their</b> <b>shirts</b> on special occasions, such as FA Cup Finals. The 1936 cup final was the fourth occasion such a badge was worn. Sheffield United also wore crested red and white shirts, their vertical stripe design.|$|E
5|$|In home matches, the team's outfield players {{traditionally}} {{wear the}} colours of the Belgian flag: black, yellow and red. Red dominates the strip {{and is often}} the sole jersey colour. The away colours are usually white, black or both; in 2014, the squad introduced a third, yellow kit. <b>Their</b> <b>shirts</b> are often trimmed with tricolores at the margins. Since 1981, the RBFA emblem has been the national team's badge; the previous badge was a yellow lion on a black shield, similar to the escutcheon of the national coat of arms.|$|E

5|$|Shirts are {{normally}} {{made of a}} polyester mesh, which does not trap the sweat and body heat {{in the same way}} as a shirt made of a natural fibre. Most professional clubs have sponsors' logos on the front of <b>their</b> <b>shirts,</b> which can generate significant levels of income, and some also offer sponsors the chance to place their logos on the back of <b>their</b> <b>shirts.</b> Depending on local rules, there may be restrictions on how large these logos may be or on what logos may be displayed. Competitions such as the Premier League may also require players to wear patches on their sleeves depicting the logo of the competition. A player's number is usually printed on the back of the shirt, although international teams often also place numbers on the front, and professional teams generally print a player's surname above his number. The captain of each team is usually required to wear an elasticated armband around the left sleeve to identify him as the captain to the referee and supporters.|$|E

QPR also decided to retire the number 31 shirt in memory of Jones, who wore that shirt during his career. In their league game against Southampton on 1 September 2007, all of the QPR players carried Jones' name {{on the back of}} <b>their</b> <b>shirts</b> as {{a mark of}} respect. Ten days later, in the England U19 friendly against Belarus at Meadow Lane in Nottingham, a minute's applause was held before the match.|$|E

5|$|The {{predominant}} club colours {{are green}} and white, {{which have been}} used since {{the formation of the}} club in 1875. The strip typically has a green body, white sleeves and a white collar. The shorts are normally white, although green has been used in recent seasons. The socks are green, usually with some white detail. Hibs have used yellow, purple, black, white and a dark green in recent seasons for their alternate kits. In 1977, Hibs became the first club in Scotland to bear sponsorship on <b>their</b> <b>shirts.</b> This arrangement prompted television companies to threaten a boycott of Hibs games if they used the sponsored kit, which resulted in the club using an alternate kit for the first time.|$|E
5|$|While no {{official}} service uniform {{was developed for}} the tropics, during the Mutiny in India in 1857, many of the regiments fought in their undress uniform (white drill), rather than the standard uniform. The 52nd were the first regiment to dye their white uniforms khaki {{for use in the}} field. This early khaki was a grey colour. For most purposes, they discarded their coats and, adopting the Indian traditions, wore <b>their</b> <b>shirts</b> out, rather than tucked in; shirts were also dyed. The 52nd also developed turbans to wear over their standard-issue forage caps. Following the mutiny, regiments returned to the standard red clothing.|$|E
5|$|During the {{original}} era the Panthers {{did not have}} a logo, instead using stylised lettering on the front of <b>their</b> <b>shirts.</b> The club's current logo was adopted in 2003 and is the fifth to be used since the Panthers were reformed. The first was used between 1980 and 1994 and was the silhouette of a Panthers' head in a red circle. The second logo, adopted in 1994, was similar to the first but used a more detailed Panthers' head. The third logo, introduced in 1998, featured a keyhole shaped like the head of a cat with a Panther reaching through it. The fourth logo was adopted following the move to the National Ice Centre and was similar to the logo of German side Augsburger Panther. The stylised lettering used during {{the original}} era was used again on special shirts made to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the club in 2006.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s {{manufacturers}} such as Hummel and Adidas {{began to}} design shirts with increasingly intricate designs, as new technology {{led to the}} introduction of such design elements as shadow prints and pinstripes. Hummel's distinctive halved strip designed for the Danish national team for the 1986 FIFA World Cup caused a stir in the media but FIFA worried about moiré artefacts in television pictures. Shorts became shorter than ever during the 1970s and 1980s, and often included the player's number on the front. In the 1991 FA Cup Final Tottenham Hotspur's players lined up in long baggy shorts. Although, the new look was derided, clubs in Britain and elsewhere had within a short time adopted the longer shorts. In the 1990s shirt designs became increasingly complex, with many teams sporting extremely gaudy colour schemes. Design decisions were increasingly driven by the need for the shirt to look good when worn by fans as a fashion item, but many designs from this era have since come to be regarded as amongst the worst of all time. In 1996, Manchester United notoriously introduced a grey strip which had been specifically designed to look good when worn with jeans, but abandoned it halfway through a match after manager Alex Ferguson claimed that the reason why his team was losing 3–0 was that the players could not see each other on the pitch. United switched to different colours for the second half and scored one goal without reply. The leading leagues also introduced squad numbers, whereby each player is allocated a specific number for the duration of a season. A brief fad arose for players celebrating goals by lifting or completely removing <b>their</b> <b>shirts</b> to reveal political, religious or personal slogans printed on undershirts. This led to a ruling from the International Football Association Board in 2002 that undershirts must not contain slogans or logos; since 2004 it has been a bookable offence for players to remove <b>their</b> <b>shirts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Juventus {{moved to}} the Stadio Comunale, {{but for the rest}} of the 1930s and the {{majority}} of the 1940s they were unable to recapture championship dominance. After the Second World War, Gianni Agnelli was appointed honorary president. The club added two more league championships to its name in the 1949–50 and 1951–52 seasons, the latter of which was under the management of Englishman Jesse Carver. Two new strikers were signed during 1957–58: Welshman John Charles and Italian Argentine Omar Sívori, playing alongside longtime member Giampiero Boniperti. That season saw Juventus awarded with the Golden Star for Sport Excellence to wear on <b>their</b> <b>shirts</b> after becoming the first Italian side to win ten league titles. In the same season, Sívori became the first ever player at the club to win the European Footballer of the Year. The following season, they beat Fiorentina to complete their first league and cup double, winning Serie A and Coppa Italia. Boniperti retired in 1961 as the all-time top scorer at the club, with 182goals in all competitions, a club record which stood for 45 years.|$|E
5|$|City have {{previously}} worn three other badges on <b>their</b> <b>shirts,</b> {{prior to their}} current badge which was implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the current badge, inside a circle bearing {{the name of the}} club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced {{the lower half of the}} shield with the red rose of Lancashire. On occasions when Manchester City plays in a major cup final, the usual badge has not been used; instead shirts bearing a badge of the arms of the City of Manchester are used, as a symbol of pride in representing the city of Manchester at a major event. This practice originates from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind, but has continued throughout the history of the club. For the 2011 FA Cup Final, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.|$|E

5|$|Sporadic {{experiments}} with numbered shirts {{took place in}} the 1920s but the idea did not initially catch on. The first major match in which numbers were worn was the 1933 FA Cup Final between Everton and Manchester City. Rather than the numbers being added to the clubs' existing strips, two special sets, one white and one red, were made for the final and allocated to the two teams by the toss of a coin. The Everton players wore numbers 1–11, while the City players wore 12–22. It was not until {{around the time of the}} Second World War that numbering became standard, with teams wearing numbers 1–11. Although there were no regulations on which player should wear which number, specific numbers came to be associated with specific positions on the field of play, a prime example being the number 9 shirt which was usually reserved for the team's main striker. In contrast to the usual practice, Scottish club Celtic wore numbers on their shorts rather than <b>their</b> <b>shirts</b> until 1975 for international matches, and until 1994 for domestic matches. The 1930s also saw great advancements in boot manufacture, with new synthetic materials and softer leathers becoming available. By 1936 players in Europe were wearing boots which weighed only a third of the weight of the rigid boots of a decade earlier, although British clubs did not adopt the new-style boots, with players such as Billy Wright openly pronouncing their disdain for the new footwear and claiming that it was more suited to ballet than football.|$|E
25|$|In addition, clubs {{may also}} sell ad {{space on the}} front of <b>their</b> <b>shirts,</b> {{following}} the practice of international sport, specifically association football. There are currently seven clubs that have signed sponsorship deals to have company logos placed {{on the front of}} <b>their</b> <b>shirts.</b> The most lucrative shirt sponsorship occurred when St. Ann's Rangers announced a six-year agreement with PlusOne Fashion of the United States to supply training, travel, and match-day shirts valuing US$75,000 for each season of the six-year deal.|$|E
