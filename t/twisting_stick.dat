5000|$|Another {{important}} early {{figure was}} German surgeon Wilhelm Fabry (1540-1634), [...] "the Father of German Surgery", {{who was the}} first to recommend amputation above the gangrenous area, and to describe a windlass (<b>twisting</b> <b>stick)</b> tourniquet. His Swiss wife and assistant Marie Colinet (1560-1640 improved the techniques for Caesarean Section, introducing the use of heat for dilating and stimulating the uterus during labor. In 1624 she became the first to use a magnet to remove metal from a patient's eye, although he received the credit.|$|E
50|$|Twisted {{doughnuts}} are <b>twisted</b> <b>sticks</b> of pastry, made {{of wheat}} and/or glutinous rice flour dough braided strands, fried in oil. They {{are known as}} kkwabaegi in Korea, and as shakoy in the Philippines.|$|R
60|$|And {{scattered}} {{here and}} there upon the slope, and emphasised by little white threads of unthawed snow upon their shady sides, were shapes like <b>sticks,</b> dry <b>twisted</b> <b>sticks</b> of the same rusty hue as the rock upon which they lay. That caught one's thoughts sharply. Sticks! On a lifeless world? Then as my eye grew more accustomed to the texture of their substance, I perceived that almost all this surface had a fibrous texture, like the carpet of brown needles one finds beneath the shade of pine trees.|$|R
5000|$|Barley sugar (or barley sugar candy) is a {{traditional}} variety of boiled sweet (hard candy), often yellow or orange in colour with sometimes an extract of barley added as flavouring. It is similar to hard caramel candy in its texture and taste. Barley sugar was often made into small spiral sticks, and the name is therefore sometimes used for the Solomonic column in architecture, and twisted legs and spindles in furniture, stair bannisters and other uses. The OED describes it as [...] "a confection, usually in <b>twisted</b> <b>sticks,</b> made from sugar, formerly by boiling in a decoction of barley" ...|$|R

5000|$|O'Malley and Liam Lynch, the general, {{met with}} O'Hegarty in the {{mountains}} of West Cork, near a deserted farmhouse, just off the main road. In On Another Man's Wound O'Hegarty is described as wearing [...] "a light-blue swallow-tail coat, and trousers, a heavy woollen coat, derby hat, with a <b>twisted</b> <b>stick</b> under his arm...he was bearded, mutton-chop whiskers." [...] In the retreat that followed, the Irish lost heavy casualties, and left their wounded to the good care of the British. These were the [...] "Round-ups" [...] in which the Irish slept outside in order to avoid being at home when the Army called. They were told by Brigade to learn the English National Anthem to avoid arrest.|$|R

[...] The Camel Orbs {{come in two}} styles, Mellow and Fresh. Each pellet contains 1 milligram of nicotine, dissolving in the mouth in 10-15 minutes. The Camel Sticks product is a <b>twisted</b> <b>stick</b> {{the size of a}} toothpick that lasts in the mouth about 20-30 minutes, and contains 3.1 milligrams of nicotine. The Camel Sticks are for insertion between the upper lip and gum, and come in one style, Mellow. The Camel Strips contain 0.6 milligrams of nicotine per strip and come in one style, Fresh. The Camel Strips last 2-3 minutes on the tongue, administering nicotine through thin film drug delivery technology as used in Listerine PocketPacks breath freshening strips. A specific ingredient list naming all additives has not been made public for any of the Camel Dissolvables brands.|$|R

5|$|Pilot {{control was}} entirely through a single side-mounted control stick. Pitch and roll were {{controlled}} through conventional fore-aft and side-to-side motions, while yaw {{could be controlled}} by <b>twisting</b> the <b>stick.</b> No mechanical linkages were used, the stick instead controlled the flow of high pressure air around the craft, which either directly attached to various control surfaces, or indirectly through local cable linkages to replace controls that were intended to be cable-actuated (like throttle controls on the engines).|$|R

5000|$|Apart {{from the}} music and bars on the beaches of Haad Rin, a famous feature of the Haad Rin are the nightly fire shows put on by {{individuals}} at the Cactus and Drop-In bars. Various individuals specialize in the arts of Poi and Staff, performing mind-boggling and beautiful tricks to entertain the crowds. The firesticks are ropes <b>twisted</b> around <b>sticks</b> and soaked in diesel which, when burned, emits choking clouds of toxic stench. Many tourists are inspired by the shows and opt to take up daytime lessons before joining the evening fire shows.|$|R
50|$|The {{motion of}} a top is {{produced}} in the most simple forms by twirling the stem using the fingers. More sophisticated tops are spun by holding the axis firmly while pulling a string or <b>twisting</b> a <b>stick</b> or pushing an auger. In the kinds with an auger, an internal weight rotates, producing an overall circular motion. Some tops can be thrown, while firmly grasping a string that had been tightly wound around the stem, and the centrifugal force generated by the unwinding motion of the string will set them spinning upon touching ground.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper lip}} of the horse is grasped and the loop of chain or rope is placed around it, then {{the handle of the}} twitch is twisted until the loop is firmly around the lip. A wooden handled twitch has the {{disadvantage}} that it requires a handler and the handle may injure the horse handler if the horse throws its head. Other twitches may be attached to the halter or headcollar. An emergency twitch can be improvised by placing a loop of leather or heavy cord around the nose and tightening it by <b>twisting</b> a <b>stick</b> around and around until it is tightened sufficiently.|$|R
50|$|McCormack was {{the first}} {{manufacturer}} to wrap his candy in cellophane. Additionally, a family member is credited with inventing a machine for <b>twisting</b> and cutting <b>stick</b> candy in 1952. A year later, he invented a machine to bend it into a cane. The Keller Machine revolutionized the business and created a new industry - the commercial manufacture of candy canes.|$|R
2500|$|Wila {{is often}} growing high in trees, {{and thus can}} be {{difficult}} to harvest. [...] The most common way to collect the lichen is to reach up into the tree with a long <b>stick,</b> <b>twist</b> the lichen around the end of the stick (which is sometimes hooked) and then pull the lichen down off the tree. [...] This lichen-collecting stick is called txipmn in the Okanagan language.|$|R
60|$|Such {{has often}} been my apathy, when objects, long sought, and earnestly desired, were placed within my reach. After dinner--at which an unwonted and perverse epicurism {{detained}} me longer than usual--I lighted a cigar and paced the piazza, minutely attentive to the aspect and business of a very ordinary village. Finally, with reluctant step, and the feeling of an intruder, I walked towards Goat Island. At the tollhouse, there were further excuses for delaying the inevitable moment. My signature was required in a huge ledger, containing similar records innumerable, many of which I read. The skin of a great sturgeon, and other fishes, beasts, and reptiles; a collection of minerals, such as lie in heaps near the falls; some Indian moccasins, and other trifles, made of deer-skin and embroidered with beads; several newspapers from Montreal, New York, and Boston;--all attracted me in turn. Out {{of a number of}} <b>twisted</b> <b>sticks,</b> the manufacture of a Tuscarora Indian, I selected one of curled maple, curiously convoluted, and adorned with the carved images of a snake and a fish. Using this as my pilgrim's staff, I crossed the bridge. Above and below me were the rapids, a river of impetuous snow, with here and there a dark rock amid its whiteness, resisting all the physical fury, as any cold spirit did the moral influences of the scene. On reaching Goat Island, which separates the two great segments of the falls, I chose the right-hand path, and followed it {{to the edge of the}} American cascade. There, while the falling sheet was yet invisible, I saw the vapor that never vanishes, and the Eternal Rainbow of Niagara.|$|R

50|$|A {{primitive}} tourniquet can be {{made from}} a stick and a rope (or leather belt). The rope is made into a loop that fits over the damaged limb and the stick is inserted through the loop. The loop is tightened by <b>twisting</b> the <b>stick.</b> This primitive device stems the flow of blood but side-effects such as tissue damage and nerve damage may occur. In modern medicine, pre-assembled devices have been developed. They avoid side-effects of the traditional rope-and-stick tourniquets and can be faster or easier to apply. Some modern tourniquets, such as the Combat Application Tourniquet or the SOF Tourniquet can be applied with one hand by the injured person themself. However, it does require some practice to ensure it is applied correctly and quickly.|$|R
50|$|Around 1:45 pm, {{juvenile}} Parole Officer Steve Jones {{spotted a}} boy's black shoe {{floating in a}} muddy creek {{that led to a}} major drainage canal in Robin Hood Hills. A subsequent search of the ditch revealed the bodies of three boys. They had been stripped naked and were hogtied with their own shoelaces: their right ankles tied to their right wrists behind their backs, the same with their left arms and legs. Their clothing was found in the creek, some of it <b>twisted</b> around <b>sticks</b> that had been thrust into the muddy ditch bed. The clothing was mostly turned inside-out; two pairs of the boys' underwear were never recovered. Christopher Byers had lacerations to various parts of his body, and mutilation of his scrotum and penis.|$|R
5000|$|Mattie Lee Price (1869-1899) of Bartow County, Georgia, United States, {{was just}} {{fourteen}} {{when she became}} {{the second of the}} Georgia Wonder girls to come out of Georgia, USA during the winter of 1883-1884. [...] Georgia Wonder girls were pre-vaudeville acts in which the young women performed feats of strength, usually pitted against men. They used fulcrum and leverage techniques to lift heavy men in chairs, <b>twist</b> hickory <b>sticks</b> out of strong menâ€™s hands, and other feats of strength. There were variations of the act that included balance tests. Lulu Hurst, of Polk County who was fifteen at the time she began her act, started the phenomenon. She gave a magical demonstration at her fatherâ€™s farm in late December 1883. [...] She was usually billed as [...] "Lulu" [...] Hurst. Dixie Haygood, with the stage name of Annie Abbott, was also a famous Georgia stage magician performing an almost identical act.|$|R
5000|$|... "No {{need to be}} {{particular}} about the recipes, all food have their own uses. Rice wine and tangyuan are excellent midnight snacks, while fat bream and flowering Chinese cabbages are great delicacies." [...] Hankou Zhuzhici (an ancient book recording stories about Wuhan) produced during the Daoguang Period of the Qing dynasty, reflects indirectly the eating habits and {{a wide variety of}} distinctive snacks with a long history in Wuhan, such as Qingshuizong (a pyramid-shaped dumpling made of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves) in the Period of the Warring States, Chunbinbian in Northern & Southern dynasties, mung bean jelly in the Sui dynasty, youguo (a deep-fried <b>twisted</b> dough <b>stick)</b> in the Song and Yuan dynasties, rice wine and mianwo in the Ming and Qing dynasties as well as three-delicacy stuffed skin of bean milk, tangbao (steamed dumpling filled with minced meat and gravy) and hot braised noodles in modern times.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} screws {{tended to}} be made of wood, and they were whittled by hand, with or without the help of turning on a lathe with hand-controlled turning tools (chisels, knives, gouges), as accurately as the whittler could manage. It is likely that sometimes the wood blanks that they started from were tree branches (or juvenile trunks) that had been shaped by a vine wrapped helically around them while they grew. (In fact, various Romance words for [...] "screw" [...] come from the word root referring to vines.) Walking <b>sticks</b> <b>twisted</b> by vines show how suggestive such sticks are of a screw.|$|R
25|$|A {{primitive}} tourniquet can be {{made from}} a stick and a rope (or leather belt). The rope is made into a loop that fits over the damaged limb and the stick is inserted through the loop. The loop is tightened by <b>twisting</b> the <b>stick.</b> The primitive device may stem the flow of blood but side-effects such as soft tissue damage and nerve damage may occur due to the application of unknown, uncontrollable and excessively high pressures and pressure gradients. It is well established by evidence in the clinical literature that higher tourniquet pressures are associated with higher probabilities of tourniquet-related injuries. Modern pneumatic tourniquet systems are microcomputer-based, allowing more accurate and automatic pressure control and many important safety features to minimize the risk of patient injury. Recent trends toward personalized care has increased patient safety by allowing perioperative staff to measure and select a personalized tourniquet pressure based on the patientâ€™s Limb Occlusion Pressure, and select and apply a personalized tourniquet cuff that can adapt the shape of the tourniquet cuff {{to a wide range of}} non-cylindrical limb shapes.|$|R
50|$|When {{the bread}} sounds hollow over its whole body when tapped gently with a knife, {{it is done}} and can be gently pulled off the stick when it has cooled down enough. It can be eaten by itself or with butter, marmalade, cheese, and the like. If the {{dimensions}} of the stick are similar to a hot dog, one can squirt ketchup, mustard and other toppings into the hole of the <b>twist</b> bread and <b>stick</b> a boiled or roasted hot dog inside. In this case it is most practical to be careful in the positioning of the dough, so that there are no cracks.|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} the clouds {{overhead}} broke, and a moonbeam shot down into the forest, throwing a pale light over the cold scene. A few steps brought Harry and the accountant to the spot whence the sound had proceeded, and a loud, startling laugh rang through the night air, as the latter suddenly beheld poor Hamilton struggling, with his arms, head, and shoulders stuck into the snow, his snow-shoes <b>twisted</b> and <b>sticking</b> with the heels up and awry, {{in a sort of}} rampant confusion, and his gun buried to the locks beside him. Regaining one's perpendicular after a fall in deep snow, when the feet are encumbered by a pair of long snow-shoes, is by no means an easy thing to accomplish, in consequence of the impossibility of getting hold of anything solid on which to rest the hands. The depth is so great that the outstretched arms cannot find bottom, and every successive struggle only sinks the unhappy victim deeper down. Should no assistance be near, he will soon beat the snow to a solidity that will enable him to rise, but not in a very enviable or comfortable condition.|$|R

6000|$|The tale is {{too long}} to be given completely. Briefly, a Captain M., on St. Valentine's day, 1799, had been deer-shooting (at an odd time of the year) in the hills west of D-. He did not return, a terrible {{snowstorm}} set in, and finally {{he and his friends}} were found dead in a bothy, which the tempest had literally destroyed. Large stones from the walls were found lying at distances of a hundred yards; the wooden uprights were <b>twisted</b> like broken <b>sticks.</b> The Captain was lying dead, without his clothes, on the bed; one man was discovered at a distance, another near the Captain. Then it was remembered that, at the same bothy a month before, a shepherd lad had inquired for the Captain, had walked with him for some time, and that, on the officer's return, [...] "a mysterious anxiety hung about him." [...] A fire had also been seen blazing on an opposite height, and when some of the gillies went to the spot, [...] "there was no fire to be seen." [...] On the day when the expedition had started, the Captain was warned of the ill weather, but he said [...] "he must go." [...] He was an unpopular man, and was accused of getting money by procuring recruits from the Highlands, often by cruel means. [...] "Our informer told us nothing more; he neither told us his own opinion, nor that of the country, but left it to our own notions of the manner in which good and evil is rewarded in this life to suggest the author of the miserable event. He seemed impressed with superstitious awe on the subject, and said, 'There was na the like seen in a' Scotland.' The man is far advanced in years and is a schoolmaster in the neighbourhood of Rannoch." ...|$|R
60|$|In the {{preparation}} of the umbrella, the first difficulty that met them was how they were to conceal their private work when the turnkey came in the evenings to take away their materials for sack-making. After some examination they discovered a plank in the floor, in the corner where they were wont to sleep, which was loose and easily forced up with one of Bill's unfinished paper-knives, which he made very strong for this special purpose! Beneath there was sufficient room to stow away the cloth with which they fashioned the additional breadth to the umbrella. To have cabbaged at one time all the sail-cloth that was required would have risked discovery; they therefore appropriated small scraps each day, and sewed these neatly together until they had enough. Soon they had a ring of canvas formed, into the centre of which the umbrella fitted exactly, and this ring was so cut and sewn in gores that it formed a continuation of the umbrella, which was thus made to spread out and cover a space of about nine or ten feet in diameter. All round the extremity or margin of the ring, cords of twisted twine were fixed, at intervals of about six inches. There were about sixty of these cords or stays, all of which met and were fastened {{at the end of the}} handle. A stout line, made of four-ply twine, was fastened at the top of the umbrella, and passing through a small hole in it was tied round the whalebones inside, and <b>twisted</b> down the <b>stick</b> to the handle, to which it was firmly secured. By this means the whole machine was, as it were, bound together.|$|R
