However, the two agree to bring the baby to the triad boss' mansion, where the Landlord will meet them with <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> They reach the triad boss' mansion and hand over the baby reluctantly.

25|$|Despite of the {{recently}} gained independence from Russia, the Russian military was still present in Helsinki but did not {{take part in the}} Civil War. The company had receivables worth of 3,000,000 marks from the Russian Navy. As it was impossible to get the payment from the local military council, Schwindt travelled to Petrograd. By help of admiral Maximov he succeeded to get the whole payment in rubles, but managed to change just one third of it into Finnish marks, which was then smuggled to Helsinki into a safe place. Schwindt had to leave <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to Petrograd, where he made deposit agreements with the local branches of Branobel and ASEA. After this Schwindt returned to Finland through Sortavala and joined to the White Guard. ASEA paid the saved amount to Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works, but the sum saved to Branobel, over 1.1 million rubles, was lost due to the revolution. The collected money enabled paying salaries of the white-collar personnel and dividend to the owners.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the play, Walter and Beneatha's father has recently died, and Mama is waiting for a life insurance check for $10,000. Walter has a sense of entitlement to the money, but Mama has religious objections to alcohol and Beneatha has to remind him it is Mama's call how to spend it. Eventually Mama puts some of the money down on a new house, choosing an all-white neighborhood over a black one for the practical reason that it happens to be much cheaper. Later she relents and gives <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to Walter to invest with the provision that he reserve $3,000 for Beneatha's education. Walter passes the money on to Willy's naive sidekick Bobo, who gives it to Willy, who absconds with it, depriving Walter and Beneatha of their dreams, though not the Youngers of their new home. Meanwhile, Karl Lindner, a white representative of the neighborhood they plan to move to, makes a generous offer to buy them out. He wishes to avoid neighborhood tensions over interracial population, which to the three women's horror Walter prepares to accept as a solution to their financial setback. Lena says that while money was something they try to work for, they should never take it if it was a person's way of telling them they weren't fit to walk the same earth as them.|$|E

25|$|The {{national}} and international humanitarian response to the crisis was extensive.

Imtiaz, and Maj. Gen Javid were the leaders of their formations. Maj.Gen Farrukh Seir was in charge of foreign relief co-ordination. The relief work in Jammu and Kashmir was led by IAS officers of the state administration, Bashir Runyal and Jaipal Singh. In early 2006, the Government of Pakistan organized a donors' conference to raise money for reconstruction and development of the area. A total of $6.2 billion was pledged and a large amount of the money was delivered in terms of services of international NGOs with high pay scales. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> pledged, which was given to the Government of Pakistan for reconstruction and development, was used by a reconstruction authority called Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority, which was made by then military regime to accommodate retired high military officials and while keeping the command of the reconstruction and rehabilitation authority directly under the military. This authority has been highly criticised for luxurious non-developmental spending and false statistics. The basic infrastructure, including tertiary care, health, education, road networks, water supply, waste management and other basic needs, was still underdeveloped and had not reached pre-earthquake status in the region.|$|E

500|$|But the [...] "free floating" [...] {{hypothesis}} presented its own difficulties; it did {{not explain}} the ten bills missing from one packet, nor was there a logical reason that the three packets would have remained together after separating from <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> Physical evidence was incompatible with geologic evidence: Himmelsbach observed that free-floating bundles {{would have had to}} wash up on the bank [...] "within a couple of years" [...] of the hijacking; otherwise the rubber bands would have long since deteriorated, an observation confirmed experimentally by the Cooper Research Team (see Ongoing investigation below). Geological evidence suggested that the bills arrived at Tina Bar well after 1974, the year of a Corps of Engineers dredging operation on that stretch of the river. Geologist Leonard Palmer of Portland State University found two distinct layers of sand and sediment between the clay deposited on the river bank by the dredge and the sand layer in which the bills were buried, indicating that the bills arrived long after dredging had been completed. The Cooper Research Team later challenged Palmer's conclusion, citing evidence that the clay layer was a natural deposit. That finding, if true, favors an arrival time of less than one year after the event (based on the rubber band experiment), but does not help to explain how the bundles got to Tina Bar, nor from where they came.|$|E
