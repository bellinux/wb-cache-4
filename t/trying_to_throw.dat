5|$|Many {{months before}} the coup, Đông had met Diệm's brother and adviser Ngô Đình Nhu, widely {{regarded}} as the brains of the regime, to ask for reform and de-politicisation of the army. Đông said that the meeting went well and was hopeful that Nhu would enact change. However, a few weeks later, Dong and his collaborators were transferred to different commands and physically separated. Fearing that Diệm and Nhu were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> their plans off balance, they accelerated their planning work, and decided to move on October 6. However, they were then scheduled to go into battle against the communists near Kon Tum in the II Corps in the Central Highlands, forcing a postponement. According to the historian George McTurnan Kahin, Đông was without a command by the time the coup was held.|$|E

25|$|The game {{started with}} the Badgers kicking off to the Gamecocks. South Carolina would pickup three first downs but would punt after {{they go to the}} Wisconsin 36–yard line. The Badgers would then pickup two first downs on their first drive but stalled at the South Carolina 30–yard line. Wisconsin lined up in a punt {{formation}} and attempted a fake but Badgers punter Drew Meyer's pass was incomplete. The Gamecocks' next drive would result in a punt. On the Badgers next drive, QB Joel Stave was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> away a pass into the ground as he was pressured but the pass deflected off a leg of his own lineman and into the hands of a South Carolina defender. On the very next play, South Carolina QB Connor Shaw threw a 39–yard touchdown pass to WR Bruce Ellington. The first quarter came to an end as the Badgers started their drive. Wisconsin would answer with a 1–yard touchdown pass to TE Sam Arneson from Joel Stave. South Carolina then drove 86 yards on 12 plays scoring on a reverse throwback to the quarterback. Wide receiver Bruce Ellington threw a 9–yard pass to quarterback Connoer Shaw. The extra point failed because of a low snap then caused the holder for South Carolina to try and run for the conversion but was tackled well short of the goal line. The Badgers answered again on their next drive with a 16 play, 75 yard drive that used up over six and a half minutes. The drive was capped by a 3–yard touchdown pass to WR Jeff Duckworth from Joel Stave. After the kickoff and a South Carolina kneel down, the Badgers led 14–13 at halftime.|$|E
25|$|With {{the start}} of Game 3 delayed by rain {{for an hour and}} 31 minutes, the series finally resumed in Philadelphia just after 10 pm EST. Jamie Moyer became the oldest pitcher to start a World Series game, facing off against ALCS MVP Matt Garza. Philadelphia was on the board early, as Chase Utley was put out on a ground ball that scored a runner from third. The Rays would even the game at one run each in the 2nd inning as Gabe Gross flew out on a {{sacrifice}} fly. The Phillies would take the lead back in the 2nd inning after a solo home run by Carlos Ruiz. The Phillies would make it 4–1 in the 6th inning from back-to-back home runs by Chase Utley and Ryan Howard. Gabe Gross scored Carl Crawford by grounding out, and Jason Bartlett would do the same to score Dioner Navarro during the next at-bat to make the score 4–3 Philadelphia. In the 8th inning for the Rays, B.J. Upton would single to reach base. During Evan Longoria's at-bat, Upton would steal 2nd base, and later steal 3rd base in the same at-bat. <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> out Upton at 3rd base, Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz made a throwing error which allowed Upton to score and tie the game at 4–4. The 9th inning went sour for the Rays defensively, as Phillies batter Eric Bruntlett was hit by a pitch. When Bruntlett attempted to steal 2nd base, Rays catcher Dioner Navarro made a throwing error which allowed Bruntlett to advance to 3rd base. The Rays intentionally walked the next two batters, which loaded the bases with no outs. Carlos Ruiz would hit a soft ground ball down the 3rd base line, which was fielded cleanly by Rays 3rd baseman Evan Longoria, but trying to toss to Navarro at home to make a forceout, sailed the throw over the catcher's head, and the winning run was scored by the Phillies to win the game 5–4, and take a two games to one series lead. Because of the game's late start, it was not completed until 1:47 am EST.|$|E

2500|$|The 1999 event {{returned}} to England after sixteen years with some matches also held in Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands. After losing two matches {{in the group}} phase, one of the favourites, Australia needed to avoid defeat in seven consecutive matches to win the title. They subsequently were required to defeat South Africa in the final Super Six match at Headingley. After South Africa had reached 271, Australia were struggling when captain Steve Waugh hit a ball straight to Herschelle Gibbs, who dropped it after <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> {{the ball into the}} air in celebration, eliciting the barb from Waugh that he had [...] "dropped the World Cup". Waugh struck an unbeaten century to guide Australia to their target in their Super Six match against South Africa off the final ball of the match. Australia then faced South Africa again in the semi-final and posted a target of 213. South Africa needed nine runs from the final over with one wicket remaining, with man of the tournament Lance Klusener on strike. He struck the first two balls to the fence, leaving one run from the remaining four balls. However, a mix-up between Klusener and Allan Donald on the fourth ball saw Donald drop his bat and be stranded mid-pitch to be run out. The match was a tie, allowing Australia to advance to the final due to earlier results. [...] In the other semi-final, Pakistan, who had qualified first in both the group and Super Six phase, defeated New Zealand by nine wickets. In the final Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and reached the target in just over 20 overs, with eight wickets in hand.|$|E
