5|$|The {{two main}} issues {{considered}} by the High Court were whether the Migration Act 1958 (the legislation governing immigration to Australia) permitted a person in Al-Kateb's situation to be detained indefinitely, and if so, whether this was permissible under the Constitution of Australia. A majority of the court decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> did allow indefinite detention, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> was not unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|A 2012 court {{decision}} concerning {{a state law}} attempting {{to shut down the}} Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant affirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> gives the federal government exclusive authority over safety at nuclear power plants. This allowed Vermont Yankee to continue operating until it was voluntarily shut down by the owner for economic reasons.|$|E
5|$|A 2013/4 {{survey by}} the National Association for Business Economics found that about 75 percent of those {{surveyed}} said ACA hadn’t influenced their planning or expectations for 2014, and 85 percent said the law wouldn’t prompt a change in their hiring practices. Some 21 percent of 64 businesses surveyed said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>act</b> would have a harmful effect and 5 percent said it would be beneficial.|$|E
2500|$|The High Court held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 1949 <b>Act</b> was primary legislation, {{despite being}} unusual in <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Courts can rule {{on whether the}} {{provisions}} of <b>the</b> 1911 <b>Act</b> are complied with. It was held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 1911 <b>Act</b> clearly permits <b>the</b> procedures specified in <b>the</b> Parliament <b>Acts</b> {{to be used for}} [...] "any Public Bill", and this was sufficient to dispose of <b>the</b> argument <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 1911 <b>Act</b> could not be used to amend itself. The Court took <b>the</b> view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 1911 <b>Act</b> was a 'remodelling' of the constitution rather than a delegation of power.|$|R
50|$|Chief Justice Hughes {{also wrote}} a {{separate}} opinion, agreeing {{with the other}} five justices <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>act's</b> labor provision was unconstitutional because it was poorly drafted and did not fall within Congress' jurisdiction to regulate interstate commerce but mainly sided with Cardozo's opinion and noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>act's</b> labor and marketing provisions were not dependent on one another. On April 12, 1937 however, Hughes, who wrote the majority opinion, would find <b>the</b> pro-labor Wagner <b>Act</b> constitutional in five separate cases and noted that it was skillfully drafted and specified interstate commerce regulations.|$|R

5|$|As this {{statement}} was not true, Alvarez was indicted {{for violating the}} Stolen Valor Act. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, {{the place where the}} trial was to occur, rejected Alvarez's claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> was unconstitutional. This decision was reversed by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which held the law invalid.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, M. C. Rajah, a Justice Party leader {{from the}} Dalit {{community}} protested {{against the government}} order arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>act</b> did not guarantee adequate representation of Dalits who he felt deserved 30% reservation in {{the administration and the}} services. When the Justice Party failed to respond, he resigned from the primary membership of the party.|$|E
5|$|In Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Dabit (2005), Sotomayor wrote a {{unanimous}} {{opinion that the}} Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 did not preempt class action claims in state courts by stockbrokers alleging misleading inducement {{to buy or sell}} stocks. The Supreme Court handed down an 8–0 decision stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> did preempt such claims, thereby overruling Sotomayor's decision.|$|E
50|$|Eutyches' accuser, Bishop Eusebius of Dorylaeum, was {{not allowed}} to be heard. <b>The</b> bishops agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>acts</b> of <b>the</b> {{condemnation}} of Eutyches, at the 448 AD Constantinople council, should be read, but the legates of Rome asked that Leo's letter might be heard first. Eutyches interrupted with <b>the</b> complaint <b>that</b> he did not trust these legates; they had been to dine with Flavian, and had received much courtesy. Pope Dioscorus decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>acts</b> of <b>the</b> trial should have precedence, and so the letter of Leo I was not read.|$|R
50|$|The Moscow City Court {{concluded}} in 2004 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>acts</b> of terrorism were organized and financed by {{leaders of the}} illegal armed group Caucasus Islamic Institute Ibn al-Khattab and Abu Omar al-Saif.|$|R
50|$|Critics {{complain}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Greenbelt <b>act</b> {{is responsible}} for the housing crisis in Southern Ontario.

5|$|Opponents {{argue that}} actual energy savings are inconclusive, that DST {{increases}} health risks such as heart attack, that DST can disrupt morning activities, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>act</b> of changing clocks {{twice a year}} is economically and socially disruptive and cancels out any benefit. Farmers have tended to oppose DST.|$|E

5000|$|In his book, The Coming of the Third Reich, {{historian}} Richard J. Evans argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Enabling <b>Act</b> {{may have}} been invalid. He contended that Göring's refusal to even acknowledge the Communist seats {{for the purposes of}} a quorum was an [...] "illegal act." [...] (It should be noted <b>that</b> even if <b>the</b> Communists had been present and voting, <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> would have still passed with, at the very least, 68.7 percent support.) He also argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>act's</b> passage in <b>the</b> Reichsrat was tainted by the overthrow of the state governments.|$|R
50|$|In April 2009, {{officials}} at the United States Department of Justice acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NSA had engaged in large-scale overcollection of domestic communications {{in excess of the}} federal intelligence court's authority, but claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>acts</b> were unintentional and had since been rectified.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of suicide. Arguments as to acceptability of suicide in moral or social terms range from the position <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>act</b> is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, {{even if they are}} young and healthy.|$|E
5|$|Acting on {{recommendations}} from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the lost {{revenue from the}} sales tax by raising excise taxes; of particular import was the tax on whiskey, which {{was made possible by}} the repeal of Prohibition in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government, reducing the number of boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22. Critics pointed out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>act</b> also centralized more {{power in the hands of}} the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it.|$|E

5000|$|In one of MacDonald's first books, Christianizing Homer: The Odyssey, Plato, and <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> of Andrew, he posited <b>the</b> theory <b>that</b> <b>the</b> non-canonical <b>Acts</b> of Andrew was a Christian {{retelling of}} Homer's Iliad. [...] In it {{he argued that}} one could detect trends that showed {{parallels}} between the Homeric epic and <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> of Andrew. He argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> of Andrew is better understood in light of <b>the</b> Odyssey. <b>That</b> <b>the</b> order of events in <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> follows those found in <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> of Andrew, <b>that</b> certain events in <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> are better understood when understood in context of the Homeric epics, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Homeric texts commonly were available during the first century AD. In subsequent works, MacDonald expanded his hypothesis to include <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> of <b>the</b> Apostles and the Gospel of Mark as being Christian variations of the Homeric epics.|$|R
5|$|Haley's {{contribution}} to the work is notable, and several scholars discuss {{how it should be}} characterized. In a view shared by Eakin, Stone and Dyson, psychobiographical writer Eugene Victor Wolfenstein writes that Haley performed the duties of a quasi-psychoanalytic Freudian psychiatrist and spiritual confessor. Gillespie suggests, and Wolfenstein agrees, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>act</b> of self-narration was itself a transformative process that spurred significant introspection and personal change in the life of its subject.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Congress {{passed the}} Line Item Veto Act, which allowed the {{president}} to cancel items from an appropriations bill (a bill authorizing spending) once passed into law. The statute was challenged the following year. The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law as violating the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which governs {{what the president is}} permitted to do with a bill once it has passed both houses of Congress. Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties and feeling <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>act</b> did not violate separation of powers. Scalia indicated he felt that authorizing {{the president to}} cancel an appropriation was no different from allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion, which had long been accepted as constitutional.|$|E
5|$|In June 1915, Sir George Makgill, Secretary of the Anti-German Union, {{applied for}} {{permission}} from the High Court to issue quo warranto writs against Speyer and Sir Ernest Cassel, a German-born Privy Counsellor, requiring them to prove their right to hold that position. Makgill's claim was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> of Settlement 1701 prevented a person born outside Britain or its dominions from being a Privy Counsellor. In December 1915, Lord Chief Justice Lord Reading rejected the application {{on the grounds that}} the relevant sections of the Act of Settlement had been repealed by later legislation.|$|E
50|$|The House of Lords, {{affirming the}} Court of Appeal's decision, held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>acts</b> {{were done with}} a lawful object of {{protecting}} and increasing the associations profits.

5|$|In {{all human}} {{cultures}} premastication/kiss-feeding or kissing {{between mother and}} infant has been observed in all with kissing {{believed to be a}} socially ritualized form of feeding premasticated food. There is high similarity in the execution of kiss-feeding and human kisses (e.g. French kiss); in the former, the tongue is used to push food from mother to child with the child receiving both the mother's food and tongue in sucking movements, and the latter simply forgoes the premasticated food. In fact, observations across various species and cultures confirms <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>act</b> of kissing and premastication have most likely evolved from the similar relationship-based feeding behaviours.|$|E
50|$|On 26 August the Parliament {{approved}} the Treaty of Berwick (1560), and James Stewart, Earl of Moray requested and received special confirmation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>acts</b> of <b>the</b> Lords of the Congregation were lawful.
