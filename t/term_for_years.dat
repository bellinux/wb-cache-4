5000|$|King's College Junior School (also {{known as}} KCJS) is the preparatory school for King's College School located in Wimbledon, London. It was {{established}} {{in its own right}} in 1912, and educates boys from ages 7-13. [...] It occupies the same campus as the senior school.In 2016 enrollment in the junior school totalled 464 boys, divided into six year groups with three or four classes of about 20. The first two years are collectively referred to as 'Rushmere' (as they are taught in Rushmere House), while the final four years are called 'Priory'. Fees were £5,370 per <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> 3-4, and £5,950 per <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> 5-8 in 2015-16. The headmaster is Dr G A Silverlock.|$|E
5000|$|The motion made in {{the circuit}} court to modify the decree {{was based on the}} idea, that while the <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> might be a chattel real, the machinery, buildings, fixtures, and {{improvements}} placed on the land should have been sold as personal property. As the statute requires that real estate [...] "shall" [...] be sold {{at the door of the}} courthouse, the visible property could not be sold there in view of the persons attending the sale of the real estate, unless it was first severed from the land, and to have so treated it would, doubtless, have rendered not only it but the <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> worthless, as vendible articles. No such result could have been contemplated by the lawmakers, and none such can be allowed, if another reasonable and consistent construction is to be found.|$|E
5000|$|The {{system was}} {{changed for the}} 1990-1991 {{academic}} year and school years are now numbered consecutively from primary school onwards. Year 1 is {{the first year of}} primary school after Reception. The first year of secondary school (the old first form) is now known as Year 7. The Lower Sixth is now Year 12 and the Upper Sixth is Year 13. However, the term [...] "Sixth Form" [...] has still been retained as a vestige of the old system and is used as a collective <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>Years</b> 12 and 13. Public (fee-charging) schools, along with some state schools, tend to use the old system of numbering.|$|E

50|$|In New Zealand, {{under the}} old system of Forms, Standards and Juniors, Sixth Form was the {{equivalent}} of Year 12 in today's system. Year 13 was known as Seventh Form. Australia also sometimes uses the <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>Year</b> 12, though the Australian Year 12 is equivalent to the NZ Year 13 / Seventh Form and the UK's Upper Sixth / Year 13.|$|R
50|$|The school {{operates}} a house system, with girls {{being placed in}} one of the five houses at the start of their time at the school {{along with the rest of}} their forms. The five houses are named after notable women in history and each have a corresponding colour: Bronte is blue, Curie is green, Nightingale is purple, Pankhurst is yellow and Teresa is red. Five girls in the upper sixth are appointed the head of houses each year. The houses play a part in music and sports in the school, with girls earning points for winning competitions and events, in particular interhouse, a sports half-day competition occurring once a <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> 7-11. At the end of each academic year one house will win the house cup for having the most points.|$|E

60|$|There was {{no doubt}} about the {{pleasure}} he had given. Once they had got over their disappointment at finding that he was not a dead burglar, the house party rejoiced whole-heartedly at the break in the monotony of life at Blandings Castle. Relations who had not been on speaking <b>terms</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> forgot their quarrels and strolled about the grounds in perfect harmony, abusing Baxter.

Doumba's health was poor by that time, and he was often in France for medical treatment; he also faced discontent within the party due a perception that he was aloof from the party at the local level, and {{he was accused of}} ignoring the Central Committee. Rumors in May 2003 suggested that he had tried to resign but that Biya had refused to accept his resignation.|$|R
