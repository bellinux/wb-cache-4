5|$|Ti Noel {{recalls the}} tales that a fellow slave, Macandal, would regale on the {{plantation}} of their master, Lenormand de Mezy. Macandal would tell tales of magical characters and mythical kingdoms with rivers {{rising in the}} sky. He is said to not only have irresistible qualities <b>that</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> black women, but also the ability to captivate men. He suffers an accident in which his left hand is caught in machinery, and his arm is dragged in up to the shoulder. Being useless to his owner, he departs for the mountains and discovers many secret herbs, plants, and fungi that appear to have magical qualities. Ti Noel joins Macandal and both learn about the magical attributes of these natural elements. Macandal suggests {{that the time has}} come, and no longer goes to the plantation. After the rain season has passed, Ti Noel meets with him in a cave populated with strange items. Macandal has established contact with surrounding plantations, and gives instructions to ensure the death of cows using secret herbs. The poison spreads, killing livestock by the hundreds as well as Frenchmen, wiping out adults and children. Madame Lenormand de Mezy dies as a result, and the deaths continue with entire families suffering the same fate. At gunpoint, a slave eventually explains that Macandal has superhuman powers and is the Lord of Poison. Death within the plantations returns to normal rates as a result and the Frenchmen return to playing cards and drinking, as months pass with no word of Macandal. Macandal, now with the ability to transform into animal forms, like bird, fish, or insect, visits the plantation to affirm faith in his return. The slaves decide to wait four years for Macandal to complete his metamorphoses and once again become a human. After four years, he returns during a celebration and all present are delighted. The chanting alerts the white men, and preparations are made to capture Macandal. He is captured and tied to a post in order to be lashed and burned in front of massive black crowds, but he escapes, flying overhead, and lands among the crowd. He is again captured and burned, but the slaves are certain that he has been saved by African Gods and return to their plantations, laughing.|$|E

25|$|Collecting is {{for some}} people a {{childhood}} hobby, but for others a lifelong pursuit or one that begins in adulthood. Collectors who begin early in life often modify their aims when they get older. Some novice collectors start purchasing items <b>that</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> them then slowly work at learning {{how to build a}} collection, while others prefer to develop some background in the field before starting to buy items.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, five- and six-string open chords (“cowboy chords”) are more {{difficult}} to play in a regular tuning than in standard tuning. Instructional literature uses standard tuning. Traditionally a course begins with the hand in first position, that is, with the left-hand covering frets 1–4. Beginning players first learn open chords belonging to the major keys C,G, andD. Guitarists who play mainly open chords in these three major-keys and their relative minor-keys (Am,Em,Bm) may prefer standard tuning over many regular tunings, On the other hand, minor-thirds tuning features many barre chords with repeated notes, properties <b>that</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> acoustic-guitarists and beginners.|$|E
25|$|Coffee is {{the most}} {{well-established}} fair trade commodity. Most Fair Trade coffee is Coffea arabica, a type of coffee known to be grown at high altitudes.

The Fair Trade movement fixated on coffee first because it is a highly traded commodity for most producing countries and almost half the world's coffee is produced by smallholder farmers.

25|$|Discussing ethical issues, Ruse {{distinguishes between}} {{involuntary}} inclination and willful behavior, arguing that while a homosexual orientation is morally blameless, {{this is not}} necessarily true of homosexual behavior. Ruse finds no justification for homosexual or heterosexual promiscuity, but nevertheless maintains on utilitarian grounds that people should be free to be promiscuous. He criticizes ethical arguments <b>that</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> scientific claims about the naturalness or unnaturalness of homosexuality, for example the views of the Greek philosopher Plato, according to whom homosexual behavior did not occur in animals. Ruse finds this claim to be mistaken, and dismisses the idea that homosexuality is unnatural. Ruse argues that both neo-Kantian and utilitarian theories of the just state must affirm the moral worth of homosexual relationships and support equal rights for homosexuals and heterosexuals.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{this growing}} trend, {{companies}} such as Sanrio came out with merchandise like Hello Kitty. Hello Kitty was an immediate success and the obsession with cute continued to progress in other areas as well. More recently, Sanrio has released kawaii characters with deeper personalities <b>that</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> an older audience, such as Gudetama and Aggretsuko. These characters have enjoyed strong popularity as fans are drawn to their unique quirks {{in addition to their}} cute aesthetics. The 1980s also saw the rise of cute idols, such as Seiko Matsuda, who is largely credited with popularizing the trend. Women began to emulate Seiko Matsuda and her cute fashion style and mannerisms, which emphasized the helplessness and innocence of young girls. The market for cute merchandise in Japan used to be driven by Japanese girls between 15 and 18 years old. No longer limited to teenagers, the spread of making things as cute as possible, even common household items, is embraced by people of all ages.|$|E
25|$|Coates Law of Maturity is a {{principle}} used in wine tasting {{relating to the}} aging ability of wine. Developed by the British Master of Wine, Clive Coates, the principle states that a wine will remain at its peak (or optimal) drinking quality for a duration of time that {{is equal to the}} time of maturation required to reach its optimal quality. During the evolution (aging) of a wine certain flavors, aromas and textures appear and fade. Rather than developing and fading in unison, these traits each operate on a unique evolutionary path and time line. The principle allows for the subjectivity of individual tastes because it follows the logic that positive traits <b>that</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> one particular wine taster will continue to persist along the principle's guideline while for another taster these traits might not be positive and therefore not applicable to the guideline. Wine expert Tom Stevenson has noted that there is logic in Coates' principle and that he has yet to encounter an anomaly or wine that debunks it.|$|E

The team also wanted to create a satirical story, and explore the theme of anti-corporatism.
