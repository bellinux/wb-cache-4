Experiments on real images validate our method. 1...|$|R

25|$|Isaac Luria reinterpreted and recast {{the whole}} scheme of Kabbalah in the 16th century, {{essentially}} making {{the second of}} two {{different versions of the}} Kabbalah: the Medieval (the initial, direct understandings of the Zohar, later synthesised by Moshe Cordovero) and the Lurianic. However, he understood his new doctrine as no more than a new revelation-teaching of <b>the</b> <b>true</b> <b>meaning</b> of the Zohar. Lurianic Kabbalah became the dominant Kabbalistic system, displacing Cordovero's, and afterwards the Zohar was read in its light. Lurianic Kabbalists sought to integrate this with the Cordoverian scheme, seeing both as true, but describing different aspects ("Worlds") of the Divine process.|$|E

Nevertheless, Qianlong used Literary Inquisition to silence opposition.
