However, {{he had little}} {{interest}} in sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos). He had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E

25|$|Fixed {{renewable}} bushings {{are used}} in applications where the liner {{is meant to be}} used until it wears out. Slip renewable bushings are designed to be interchangeable with a given sized liner so that two different sized slip renewable bushings can be used in one liner bushing. This facilitates <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> multiple machining operations that require different inner diameter (ID) bushings, such as drilling and reaming. They usually have knurled heads so they can be easily removed.|$|E
25|$|For Hitchcock, the actors, {{like the}} props, {{were part of}} the film's setting, as he said to Truffaut:In my opinion, the chief {{requisite}} for an actor is <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be utilised and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.|$|E

30|$|The New Generation Science Standards is, {{among other}} changes, {{shifting}} away from science inquiry and towards {{the inclusion of}} scientific practices (Duschl and Bybee 2014; Osborne 2014). By comparing <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> scientific inquiry (National Research Council 2000) with the set of scientific practices, {{it is evident that}} the latter is about engaging in the processes of doing science and experiencing in that way science in a more authentic way. Engaging in scientific practices according to Osborne (2014) “presents a more authentic picture of the endeavor that is science” (p. 183) and also helps the students to develop {{a deeper understanding of the}} epistemic aspects of science. Furthermore, as Bybee (2014) argues, by engaging students in scientific practices, we involve them in an understanding of the nature of science and an understanding on the nature of scientific knowledge.|$|R

He captained New Zealand's team for three years, with only two Test wins in 18 attempts in what was a difficult tenure as New Zealand struggled to find a replacement for the retired Richard Hadlee and suffered the decline in power of their only world class batsman, Martin Crowe.|$|E
25|$|Anyanwu is the Wild Seed’s {{black female}} protagonist that is born in Africa with genetic {{mutations}} that endow her with immortality and physical strength.

Anyanwu is a “shape-shifter,” someone who is capable of altering her cells {{to create a new}} identity such as a different body, sex, age, or even species− metamorphoses she calls upon when needed to assure her survival. Although she has <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> harm, Anyanwu is a highly moral woman with a strong sense of humanity. Important to Anyanwu are family and community, autonomy and companionship, love and freedom, all of which are threatened when she meets Doro.|$|E

50|$|Thirdly, a hegemon {{must have}} will to lead, {{and the will}} to {{establish}} a hegemonic regime, as well as the capability to lead and enforce the rules of the system. After World War I, Great Britain possessed the will to lead, but lacked <b>the</b> necessary <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.

25|$|The poem is twelve {{books with}} the first six dealing with various episodes along with {{introducing}} Hindu theology. The story describes Kehama, a Brahmin priest, as he makes sacrifices to Shiva to gain power. His scheme is to conquer death and attain Amreeta to become a god himself. Arvalan, Kehama's son, attempts to take Kailyal, a peasant girl. He is stopped by Ladurlad, another peasant, and killed. Kehama decides to war against Yamen, the god of death while also seeking to torture Ladurlad in revenge. Ladurlad is cursed {{to be separated from}} nature and unable to live a human life, which included not being able to sleep. His separation from nature gives him <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what others cannot however.|$|E
25|$|Many insects can hover, or stay in {{one spot}} in the air, doing so by beating their wings rapidly. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, though, is complex; {{requiring}} the use of sideways stabilization {{as well as the}} lift necessary to overcome the force of gravity. The lifting force is caused by the downward stroke of the wings. As the wings push down on the surrounding air, the result reaction force of the air on the wings force the insect up. The wings of most insects are evolved so that, during the upward stroke, the force on the wing is small. Due {{to the fact that the}} upbeat and downbeat force the insect down and up respectively, the insect oscillates and winds up staying in the same position.|$|E
25|$|Work can be {{extracted}} also from bodies colder than the surroundings. When {{the flow of}} energy is coming into the body, work is performed by this energy obtained from the large reservoir, the surrounding. A quantitative treatment {{of the notion of}} energy quality rests on the definition of energy. According to the standard definition, Energy is a measure of <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> work. Work can involve the movement of a mass by a force that results from a transformation of energy. If there is an energy transformation, the second principle of energy flow transformations says that this process must involve the dissipation of some energy as heat. Measuring the amount of heat released is one way of quantifying the energy, or ability to do work and apply a force over a distance.|$|E
