5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with <b>tap</b> <b>water</b> may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2007, the National Institutes of Health deemed hexavalent chromium VI (chromium-6) to be a likely carcinogen in lab animals when consumed in large quantities in drinking water. Prior to the NIH study, a World Health Organization study found that chromium-6 was a likely cause of lung cancer when inhaled by humans. In 2010, test results released from a California non-profit group known as the Environmental Working Group showed that Norman's <b>tap</b> <b>water</b> has a chromium-6 concentration level of 12.90 parts per billion (ppb), which was the highest level detected among 35 U.S. cities sampled in the study. The group is studying chromium-6 levels in water supplies in an attempt to prove a causal link between the element's ingestion and cancer in humans, and as a result improve the country's water standards.|$|E

Numerous homes in Golden Meadow experienced flooding, as well. The flooding also forced the temporary closing of numerous roads across the state, including portions of U.S. Route 11 and Interstate 10. Flood waters from the storm cracked a water line in LaPlace, leaving nearly 30,000 residents and many businesses without <b>tap</b> <b>water.</b> The problem was expected to take little time to fix, though residents were advised to boil the water before drinking it.

By 2000, techniques were being used such as cooking vegetables in mineral water after discovering that the levels of calcium in <b>tap</b> <b>water</b> causes their discolouration, and freezing cuttlefish to break down the molecules in them in order to increase their tenderness.

5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in drinking water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals {{can be added to}} municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis, a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in drinking water in domestic <b>tap</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

Some <b>tap</b> <b>water</b> samples were also contaminated with ammonia at levels that were 6–18 times higher than the allowed level. Ammonia in drinking water is not a direct health risk, but it can compromise disinfection efﬁciency, cause the failure of some filters, and it causes taste and odor problems. Arsenic levels were two to three times higher than acceptable according to the World Health Organization guidelines.

The low EC, TDS, HCO 3 − and TH contents observed in dug well and borewell waters suggest short contact times between groundwater and the aquifer minerals. This {{is consistent with}} the low K+ (except W 5 and B 4) concentrations in dug well and borewell <b>waters</b> relative to <b>tap</b> <b>waters</b> (8 – 11  mg/L). Potassium concentrations in groundwater up to 10  mg/L are attributed to orthoclase or clay weathering, whereas concentrations above 10  mg/L may indicate external sources of K+ abundance (Rail 2000).

None of dug well and borewell samples complied with the WHO guideline values for coliforms (Table  1), and hence, water from these wells requires treatment before human consumption.|$|R

40|$|Drinking {{water quality}} can be {{deteriorated}} by microbial and toxic chemicals during transport, storage and handling before using by the consumer. This {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the microbial and physicochemical quality of drinking water from bottled water coolers. A total of 64 water samples, over a 5 -month period in 2012 - 2013, were collected from free standing bottled water coolers and <b>water</b> <b>taps</b> in Isfahan. <b>Water</b> samples were analyzed for heterotrophic plate count (HPC), temperature, pH, residual chlorine, turbidity, electrical conductivity (EC) and total organic carbon (TOC). Identification of predominant bacteria was also performed by sequence analysis of 16 S rDNA. The mean HPC of water coolers was determined at 38864 CFU/ml which exceeded the acceptable level for drinking water in 62 % of analyzed samples. The HPC from the water coolers was also found to be significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than that of the <b>tap</b> <b>waters.</b> The statistical analysis showed {{no significant difference between the}} values of pH, EC, turbidity and TOC in <b>water</b> coolers and <b>tap</b> <b>waters.</b> According to sequence analysis eleven species of bacteria were identified. A high HPC is indicative of microbial water quality deterioration in water coolers.

30|$|Again, {{the high}} TH in <b>tap</b> <b>waters</b> can be {{attributed}} to long residence time of groundwater in the deep fractured aquifer, leading to extended chemical weathering of dolomitic limestones (Frape et al. 1984). With hardness values largely exceeding the WHO guideline value for drinking <b>water,</b> the <b>tap</b> <b>waters</b> were categorized as very hard, while those of dug wells as soft to moderately hard. Soft waters, with low alkalinity and buffering capacity, may favor the mobility of potentially toxic heavy metals in the aquifer (De Schamphelaere and Janssen 2004; Kirby and Cravotta 2005). In contrast, hard waters require more soap to produce lather, and thus, it is unsuitable for domestic use (Srinivasa Rao and Jugran 2003). Some evidence has also indicated the role played by hard waters in heart diseases and prenatal mortality (Schroeder 1960; Agarwal and Jagetai 1997). Although such cases have not been reported in the present study area, the desirability of softer drinking water is evident among the local population. As a result, the water provided by the public water supply system should be treated before it gets to the consumers.|$|R
