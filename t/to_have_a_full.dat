Broadly speaking, Sancerre tends <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuller</b> body with more pronounced aromas, while Pouilly-Fumé wines are more perfumed. However, both wines have naturally high acidity and the potential to exhibit the minerally, flinty notes described as pierre à fusil or gunflint, as well as citrus and spicy notes.|$|R

25|$|In Western societies, {{after the}} spread of Christianity, public {{exposure}} of a woman's bare skin between the ankle and waist started to be disapproved of culturally. Upper body exposure due {{to the use of}} the popular vest bodices used in Western Europe from the 15th century to early 20th century, as the widespread dirndls used even in more traditionally conservative mountain areas and the more or less loose shirts under these, enabled a permissive view of the shoulders, décolletage and arms allowing a free exposure of upper body hair in women of all classes with less rejection or discrimination than body hair on the sex organs, obviously to conceal by implication. Many people came to consider public exposure of pubic hair to be embarrassing. It may be regarded as immodest and sometimes as obscene. However, it never came <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> hold in Western culture in wide tracts of Central Europe, until the encroaching of Protestantism during the 16th century on formerly more tolerant customs.|$|E

In 1988, after significant research and development in Australia by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Reserve Bank of Australia, Australia produced the first polymer banknote made from biaxially-oriented polypropylene (plastic), and in 1996 became the first country <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> set of circulating polymer banknotes of all denominations completely replacing its paper banknotes.

She runs around, because she wants friends." [...] Bell called the film's story is [...] "another turning point" [...] for Disney animation because the love depicted in this story is the love between siblings, a non-romantic love.

500|$|The {{change to}} a new genre {{presented}} multiple challenges to the team: while standard RPGs were designed around a scripted experience, MMORPGs were more reliant on a true sense of unscripted adventure. A major disadvantage was that Fujisawa was inexperienced with working on MMORPGs. The first major developmental issue was the need in an MMORPG <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> customizable character. Another related problem was the initial premise of an unseen force as the threat, which was unusual within the form. Fujisawa rationalized it {{into a kind of}} [...] "common sense" [...] related to the interaction between player community and necessary events within the game world that worked against accepted principles of MMORPG gameplay, which resulted in multiple staff members raising doubts as to whether the game could work. The second major issue was what types of environments to include or discard, and for this Fujisawa was prepared due to his long experience with the franchise. On top of this, the staff needed to evaluate what would work for an MMORPG in the unpredictable Japanese gaming market, which unlike {{other parts of the world}} was not a major consumer of MMORPGs. Their main object for comparison was World of Warcraft, which by that time had 12 million players worldwide but only had a small holding in Japan. While this appeared discouraging, there had not been many titles of similar scale and success within the country, so there was both space for and detractions against an equivalent MMORPG experience.|$|E
500|$|Representatives of the ship's company {{approached}} Captain Claude Cumberlege {{to ask for}} {{a one-day}} delay on departure; this would allow the sailors <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> weekend of leave, give Perth-born personnel the chance to visit their families, and give personnel another chance to invite people aboard. Cumberlege replied that as Australia had a tight schedule of [...] "welcome home" [...] port visits, such delays could not even be considered. The next morning, at around 10:30, between 80 and 100 sailors gathered in front of 'P' turret, some in working uniform, others who had just returned from shore leave still in libertyman rig. Cumberlege sent the executive officer to find out why the men had assembled, and on learning that they were repeating the previous day's request for a delay in departure, went down to address them. In a strict, legalistic tone, he informed the sailors that delaying Australias departure was impossible, and ordered them to disperse. The group obeyed this order, although some were vocal in their displeasure. Shortly after, Australia was ready to depart, but when the order to release the mooring lines and get underway was given, Cumberlege was informed that the stokers had abandoned the boiler rooms. After the assembly on deck, some sailors had masked themselves with black handkerchiefs, and encouraged or intimidated the stokers on duty into leaving their posts, leaving the navy's flagship stranded at the buoy, in full view of dignitaries and crowds lining the nearby wharf. The senior non-commissioned officers, along with sailors drafted from other departments, were sent to the boiler room to get Australia moving, and departure from Fremantle was only delayed by an hour.|$|E

These are generally intolerant, politically tolerant, generally tolerant and privately tolerant. Our profiles provide <b>a</b> <b>fuller,</b> more nuanced description of tolerant and intolerant attitudes than traditional approaches.

The ability to use experimentally obtained perceptual criteria in sound selection, in addition to a thorough description of technical characteristics of the sounds, constitutes a unique feature of the present database. Although what Gaver termed [...] "everyday listening" [...] [5] is a frequent activity, the nature of the experience has been remarkably underscrutinized, both in common discourse and in the scientific literature, and alternative definitions exist [6, 7].
