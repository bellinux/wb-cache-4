5000|$|The most {{important}} graphic {{element of the}} Sinn Féin newspaper was the Déanta i nÉirinn symbol. This distinctive logo {{was created by the}} Irish Industrial Development Association (IIDA). The text in Irish means [...] "Made in Ireland". From the autumn of 1909, Griffith’s newspapers displayed it proudly and very prominently on their front page between the words ‘sinn’ and ‘féin’ in the title-piece. It could also frequently be seen in advertisements and cartoons throughout. Both a <b>trade</b> <b>description</b> and a statement of Sinn Féin’s industrial politics, this mark played a fundamental role in the newspaper propaganda published by the SFPP. Griffith felt it important to explain to his readers what the symbol meant in the context of Sinn Féinism and in relation to his newspaper:That is our registered Irish Trade Mark number. [...] "Sinn Féin" [...] is the only journal in Ireland entitled to use the Irish Trade Mark.The reason why is that [...] "Sinn Féin" [...] is the only daily journal in Ireland printed on Irish paper. [...] "Sinn Féin" [...] is printed with Irish ink. All the materials procurable in Ireland that go to make up a newspaper are used in [...] "Sinn Féin". All other daily journals in Ireland import their paper from England, America, France, or Holland. If they procured their paper and ink at home, at least £100,000 a year would be retained in this country and permanent employment provided for about 2,000 people. [...] "Sinn Féin" [...] is the only daily paper in Ireland that supports the paper-making and ink-making industries of the country. That is why [...] "Sinn Féin" [...] alone is entitled to bear the Irish Trade Mark. The Irish Trade Mark distinguishes what is Irish from what is spurious. We bear the Irish Trade Mark [...]Here Griffith blends Sinn Féin's industrial politics (buy Irish, provide employment, stop emigration) with a sales pitch for the new Sinn Féin Daily. While promoting his own newspaper at the expense of his competitors, Griffith highlights the existence of a native ink-making and paper-making industry. Other newspapers which purport to promote the national cause fall into the category of spurious. Their alleged nationalism is therefore extremely questionable.In his 1917 book Francis P. Jones, an American friend of Griffith's and historian of the early Sinn Féin movement explains the background {{to the creation of the}} trademark and the symbolism of its design. After outlining a major difficulty faced by Irish manufacturers, he describes the measures taken to protect them:Irish names were attached to goods that never saw Ireland until they were brought into the country ready for sale. The Sinn Feiners discovered the fraud, and countered by the establishment of the Irish trademark. A sign peculiar to Ireland was agreed upon, namely a scroll device representing the legendary Collar of Malachi, surrounded by the words, Deantha i nEirinn sic. (Made in Ireland). The use of this sign was permitted to manufacturers who could show that their goods were made in the country, and every infringement was prosecuted under the British Trades Mark Law, the Irish people being for once able to use British law to their own advantage.|$|E
