500|$|DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{commented on}} the episode in a {{negative}} way, writing that it was [...] "a harsh and cynical move , <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> forgive the decision if it produced a more satisfying episode. Perhaps the writers made this one super-sincere to counteract the inherent cynicism behind its origins, but the show just seems sappy and lame." [...] Winnipeg Free Press columnist Randall King wrote in his review of the eleventh season of The Simpsons that there is [...] "something undeniably funny about having Maude Flanders die by a barrage of T-shirts fired by air cannons at a speedway. But the episode Alone Again Natura-Diddily was proof that the dependably brilliant series could – and did – go seriously wrong when it turned 11. Killing off Maude was a sin [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|The leaders then {{discussed}} the geographical definition of Ulster, technically nine counties and usually defined {{as at least}} six. Carson always referred to the nine counties of Ulster, but Law told Asquith that if an appropriate settlement could be made with a smaller number Carson [...] "would see his people and probably, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not give any promise to that effect, try to induce them to accept it".|$|E
2500|$|Stallman {{started the}} project {{on his own and}} describes: [...] "As an {{operating}} system developer, I had the right skills for this job. So even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not take success for granted, I realized that I was elected to do the job. I chose to make the system compatible with Unix so that it would be portable, and so that Unix users could easily switch to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For the present," [...] Dartrey admitted, [...] "Tallente {{is doing}} excellently. <b>I</b> wish, <b>though,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{see a little}} farther into the future." ...|$|R
6000|$|For I am called Little Buttercup,--dear Little Buttercup, [...] <b>Though</b> <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> tell why; But still I'm called Buttercup,--poor Little Buttercup, [...] Sweet Little Buttercup I! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I {{have felt}} {{something}} indefinable between us, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> bear {{to speak of}} it, ever since Bobus went. Do {{you think he did}} her any harm?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Regarding the Senate's {{rejection}} of Rutledge's nomination, then Vice President John Adams {{wrote to his}} wife Abigail that it [...] "gave me pain for an old friend, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not but think he deserved it. Chief Justices must not go to illegal Meetings and become popular orators in favor of Sedition, nor inflame the popular discontents which are ill founded, nor propagate Disunion, Division, Contention and delusion among the people." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1955, Coltrane married Naima (born Juanita Grubbs). Naima Coltrane, who {{was already}} a Muslim convert, heavily {{influenced}} his spirituality. [...] When they married, Naima had a five-year-old daughter named Antonia, later named Saeeda. Coltrane adopted Saeeda. Coltrane met Naima {{at the home of}} bassist Steve Davis in Philadelphia. The love ballad he wrote to honor his wife, [...] "Naima" [...] was Coltrane's favorite composition. In 1956 the couple left Philadelphia with their six-year-old daughter in tow and moved to New York City. [...] In August 1957, Coltrane, Naima and Saeeda moved into an apartment on 103d St. and Amsterdam Ave. in New York, near Central Park West. A few years later, John and Naima Coltrane purchased a home on Long Island on Mexico Street. This is the house where they would eventually break up in 1963. Said Naima about the break in J.C. Thomas's Chasin' the Trane: [...] "I could feel {{it was going to happen}} sooner or later, so I wasn't really surprised when John moved out of the house in the summer of 1963. He didn't offer any explanation. He just told me there were things he had to do, and he left only with his clothes and his horns. He stayed in a hotel sometimes, other times with his mother in Philadelphia. All he said was, 'Naima, I'm going to make a change.' Even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> feel it coming, it hurt, and I didn't get over it for at least another year." [...] But Coltrane kept a close relationship with Naima, even calling her in 1964 to tell her that 90% of his playing would be prayer. [...] Coltrane would be dead in four years, but he always kept in touch with her. Naima brought serenity and a calmness into his life. All who knew Naima described her gentle spirit and serenity. They remained in touch until his death in 1967. Naima Coltrane died of a heart attack in October 1996.|$|E

60|$|Oh, well, we'll do our best. And <b>though</b> <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> do {{arithmetic}} I've {{always thought}} perhaps {{one might be}} saved without. Good-bye, Lady Little, {{and thank you for}} having us.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did <b>though!</b> <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{show you}} the sample. Some Manchester chaps said it {{was as good as}} any Sea Island cotton on the market." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Which is it, Barker?" [...] {{repeated}} his tormentor. [...] "I know it's {{human nature to}} deny it; <b>though</b> <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> understand why; if I was engaged, the Sunday papers should have it about as quick!" ...|$|R
60|$|No one dared {{hesitate}} about obeying these orders, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{see that}} {{one or two of}} the lads disliked the business.|$|E
6000|$|... “No,” I answered, and she {{questioned}} no further, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{have sworn}} her eyes retained {{for some time}} a mocking, teasing expression.|$|E
60|$|A {{compliment}} from Demetrios Contos was {{a compliment}} indeed, and I keenly appreciated it, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only nod {{my head in}} acknowledgment.|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn’t do that," [...] said Mrs. Cox. [...] "I couldn’t {{stand the}} disgrace, even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> knew <b>I</b> <b>could</b> pay him out. As it is, Cox is always setting his family above mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|When Shultz stalked up to {{the plate}} I shut my eyes a moment, and so still was it that the field and stands might have been empty. Yet, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> tried, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not keep my eyes closed. I opened them to watch the Rube. I knew Spears felt the same as I, for he was blowing like a {{porpoise}} and muttering to himself: [...] "Mebee the Rube won't last an' I've no one to put in!" ...|$|R
60|$|As I spoke, {{the chief}} arose, and, dark <b>though</b> it was, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see a gleam of {{intelligence}} on his swarthy visage.|$|R
60|$|He {{never looked}} up, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{see he was}} getting excited under his dejection. He slapped the bench with his open palm.|$|E
60|$|But, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not cry, I {{could make}} a noise with my heels, and this I did with a right good will.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I {{want to get}} away. I feel {{at moments}} as <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bolt for it.... Silly, isn't it? Undisciplined." ...|$|E
60|$|And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair {{received}} me. I still possessed my senses, <b>though</b> {{just now}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not speak.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{answer this}} {{question}} in the affirmative; having studied French under a Frenchman, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak the language intelligibly <b>though</b> not fluently. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> also read it well, and write it decently.|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides {{what can}} they tell me at this moment? They {{have gone to the}} Moors and are enjoying themselves. They asked me to go with them, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not go, because you see <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not leave Joan; <b>though</b> why <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not leave her, I really cannot understand, because Egerton has got some moors this year, and he leaves Lady Augusta with her father." ...|$|R
60|$|Now an' again Mulvaney looked acrost at me, an' <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> mak nowt o' {{what he was}} after, I {{concluded}} to {{take his}} leead.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Is he {{that kind}} of a man?’ I said, staring on these lamps as <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{decipher}} in them the secret of my cousin’s character.|$|E
60|$|I {{once more}} covered my eyes with my hand, {{as if to}} shade them from the light, and listened, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} conceal my agitation.|$|E
6000|$|Wildeve looked thoughtfully at her. [...] "It {{is easier}} to say you will sing than to do it; <b>though</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> would {{encourage}} you in your attempt. But as life means nothing to me, without one thing which is now impossible, you will forgive me {{for not being able}} to encourage you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas! not so, <b>though</b> perhaps <b>I</b> <b>could</b> if <b>I</b> might. It is very simple, Bickley. Standing here, I {{heard you}} say that {{although}} the sun was well down {{there was no one}} to meet you as Humphrey had expected, and from those words and your voice I guessed the rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now I answered, [...] "Who {{is it that}} speaks, and whence?" [...] <b>though,</b> really, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see no one, I {{thought that}} I must be demented.|$|R
60|$|You {{may think}} that I did not feel {{disposed}} to contradict him, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make nothing of this sudden and welcome change in his manner.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess you're right," [...] was Phil's reply. [...] "I overheard Lowell {{speaking}} about {{something of the}} kind, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not quite make it out." ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} about this speech which I did not altogether like, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not detect anything like sarcasm {{in the tone of}} the speaker.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My family,' said Mrs. Micawber, {{who always}} said those two words with an air, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> {{discover}} who {{came under the}} denomination, 'my family are of opinion that Mr. Micawber should quit London, and exert his talents in the country. Mr. Micawber {{is a man of}} great talent, Master Copperfield.' ...|$|R
50|$|Though {{the primary}} {{character}} is Rayne, {{there are a}} large number of supporting characters, and the strip will sometimes go for up to a week without a strip featuring Rayne. These usually involve large story arcs involving the other characters, <b>though</b> Least <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> Do still specializes in the one strip joke.|$|R
60|$|We {{went into}} {{the room where the}} feast had been held and there drank some wine, <b>though</b> eat <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not. The cup from which I drank was, as it chanced, the same in which I had pledged Blanche at the bride feast. Now I pledged her spirit whereon I prayed God's mercy.|$|R
