40|$|This {{qualitative}} research, which {{adopted a}} pairing of social constructionism and participatory paradigms, posed {{the question of}} how Educational Psychologists and Special <b>Educational</b> <b>Needs</b> Co-ordinators view <b>the</b> role of <b>the</b> <b>Educational</b> Psychologist in supporting mental health and psychological wellbeing in schools. The views of four Educational Psychologists and three Special <b>Educational</b> <b>Needs</b> Co-ordinators were explored through semi-structured interviews. A thematic analysis of the interviews led to two thematic maps being created. Educational Psychologists wished to support the mental health and wellbeing of both children and young people and staff and viewed it as part of their role. However, they were aware of the barriers to engaging in his type of work, which could have wide-reaching implications for practice. <b>The</b> <b>Educational</b> Psychologists gave examples of mental health and wellbeing support that they had given to schools at an individual, group and whole school level. <b>The</b> <b>Educational</b> Psychologists identified a focus on emotional wellbeing that was threaded through all their duties, but acknowledged that this focus was not always recognised or understood by other professionals or service users. <b>The</b> Special <b>Educational</b> <b>Needs</b> Co-ordinators had not previously considered <b>the</b> <b>Educational</b> Psychology role to include mental health and wellbeing within schools but rather carrying out assessment. <b>The</b> Special <b>Educational</b> <b>Needs</b> Co-ordinators called for clarity around <b>the</b> <b>Educational</b> Psychology role and the activities that <b>the</b> <b>Educational</b> Psychology service can offer. <b>The</b> Special <b>Educational</b> <b>Needs</b> Co-ordinators expressed that they would value more support from Educational Psychologists to deliver therapeutic interventions and set up supervision for staff in schools. A working party comprising the principal researcher and <b>the</b> three Special <b>Educational</b> <b>Needs</b> Co-ordinators co-researchers explored the thematic maps and worked collaboratively to agree next steps, including ways in which the role of <b>the</b> <b>Educational</b> Psychologist in supporting mental health and wellbeing could be communicated more clearly with other professionals within the local authority where the research took place...|$|R

40|$|The time of {{presence}} of a mother in a hospital for delivery is appropriate for checking the health of mother and infant, as well as educating her about the postnatal care. Because a successful education {{is based on the}} cooperation of learner and teacher, the aim of this survey was to determine and compare the opinions of mothers and nurses about <b>the</b> postnatal <b>educational</b> <b>needs.</b> Fifty-one postnatal nurses (Nurse, midwife and nurse assistant) and 70 mothers, during the first 24 hours of post delivery, completed the standard McMolen’s questionnaire. We found that although postnatal <b>educational</b> <b>needs</b> of mothers and nurses were roughly similar, but the mean scores of <b>educational</b> <b>needs</b> in two groups were significantly different, so that the needs were more important for mothers. Also primipara mothers and those with low educational level, had higher <b>educational</b> <b>needs.</b> Compared to <b>the</b> western surveys, <b>the</b> postnatal <b>educational</b> <b>needs</b> were more important for both mothers and nurses in our stud. This difference could be due to less attendance of mothers to prenatal courses, low educational level, primiparity and cultural differences. Our results re-affirm the importance of cooperation of mothers and nurses to determine <b>the</b> postnatal <b>educational</b> <b>needs...</b>|$|R

25|$|The University of St Andrews {{was at a}} {{low point}} in its {{fortunes}} {{in the early part}} of the century. It was restructured by commissioners appointed under the 1858 act and began a revival. It pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities, creating the Lady Literate in Arts (LLA) in 1882, which proved highly popular. From 1892 Scottish universities could all admit and graduate women, with St Andrews the first to do so, and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased from this point until the early twentieth century. A new college of St Andrews was opened in the thriving burgh of Dundee in 1883, allowing the university to teach sciences and open a medical school. The University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing <b>the</b> <b>educational</b> <b>needs</b> of youth from the urban and commercial classes. It moved from the city centre to a new set of grand neo-Gothic buildings, paid for largely by public subscription, at Gilmorehill in 1870. The two colleges at Aberdeen were considered too small to be viable and they were restructured as the University of Aberdeen in 1860. Marischal College was rebuilt in the Gothic style from 1900. Unlike the other Medieval and ecclesiastical foundations, because the University of Edinburgh was a civic college it was relatively poor. In 1858 it was taken out of the care of the city and established on a similar basis to the other ancient universities.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, Scottish universities had no entrance exam, students typically entered at ages of 15 or 16, attended for as little as two years, chose which lectures to attend and could leave without qualifications.

Entrance examinations equivalent to the School Leaving Certificate were introduced and average ages of entry rose to 17 or 18. Standard patterns of graduation in the arts curriculum offered 3-year ordinary and 4-year honours degrees and separate science faculties were able to move away from the compulsory Latin, Greek and philosophy of the old MA curriculum.
