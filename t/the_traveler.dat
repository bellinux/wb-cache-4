5|$|Eric Menyuk as <b>The</b> <b>Traveler,</b> {{a member}} of a species from Tau Alpha C who mentors Wesley Crusher.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Menyuk {{made the}} first of three {{appearances}} as <b>the</b> <b>Traveler.</b> Biff Yeager made his first appearance as the longest-running chief engineer of the first season.|$|E
5|$|The player {{continues}} to {{journey into the}} remains of a once sprawling city {{at the base of the}} mountain. Eventually making it safely to the mountain, <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> begins to climb it, struggling as they enter the colder climates and encounter deep snow and high winds. With the crevice still a fair distance away, <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> falls and collapses in the snow. Six of the white-robed figures appear before the character and grant <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> new energy, allowing the player to reach the summit of the mountain and walk into the crevice as the screen fills with white. The player is then shown the game's credits, playing over the ending cinematic scene. This scene shows a shooting star emanating from the crevice and traversing the path <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> took through the ruins, and shows glimpses of other robed travelers heading towards the mountain. Eventually, the star comes to rest at the sand dune where the game began, and the player is given the option of starting the game again. As the credits end, the player is shown the PlayStation Network IDs of the other travelers who shared part of the trek.|$|E
5000|$|The Indians of Santa Lucea {{were finally}} {{convinced}} {{that some of}} <b>the</b> <b>travelers</b> were Spanish. They {{did not think that}} <b>the</b> <b>travelers</b> with light-colored hair were Spanish, however. They told <b>the</b> <b>travelers</b> that they would be sent on to the next town. They also told <b>the</b> <b>travelers</b> that some [...] "English off Bristol", six men and a woman, were being held at that town, and that the prisoners would be killed before the Reformation party reached there.|$|R
25|$|The Lawrence family {{sold the}} hotel to <b>the</b> <b>Travelers</b> Group after Lawrence's death in 1996. <b>The</b> <b>Travelers</b> Group {{completed}} a $55 million upgrade of the hotel in 2001, which included seismic retrofitting.|$|R
5000|$|On September 30 {{the party}} {{encountered}} Ais Indians from Santa Lucea, who called them [...] "Nickaleer" [...] even though Solomon Cresson was speaking Spanish to them. They forcefully stripped <b>the</b> <b>travelers,</b> including <b>the</b> Dickinson infant, {{of all their}} remaining clothing, although one of the Indians afterwards gave a pair of breeches to Dickinson's wife. The Indians tore pages from a Bible the group carried and gave them to <b>the</b> <b>travelers</b> to cover themselves, but other Indians snatched away the pages. The Indians also threatened <b>the</b> <b>travelers</b> with arrows and knives. The party {{was taken to the}} town, and <b>the</b> <b>travelers</b> were eventually given local clothing, deer skins for the women and a sort of breechclout-apron for the men. The Indians finally fed <b>the</b> <b>travelers.</b> As Mary Dickinson's milk was failing, several women in the village nursed the Dickinson infant.|$|R
5|$|Journeys {{story is}} told wordlessly through {{gameplay}} and using cutscenes. The player's character begins on a sand dune in a seemingly endless desert. In the far distance looms a large, foreboding mountain with a glowing crevice that splits its peak. As the character approaches the mountain, they find remnants of a once-thriving civilization, eroded by sand over time. Scattered throughout the ruins {{at the end of}} each area are stones at which <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> rests; these stones give <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> the vision of meeting a larger, white-robed figure in a circular room, with art on the walls describing the rise and fall of the civilization mirroring the player's journey. The player must also contend with the ancient automatons left over from a war which ended the civilization, and which still roam the city looking for intruders.|$|E
5|$|A Lebanese {{passport}} does not, in itself, entitle {{the holder}} to enter another country. To enter another country, <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> {{must comply with}} the visa and entry requirements of the other countries to be visited, which vary {{from country to country}} and may apply specifically to a particular passport type, the traveller's nationality, criminal history, health issues, evidence of sufficient funds, evidence of ticket for exit or many other factors.|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, Olav Nils Sunde, {{owner of}} the cruiseferry company Color Line, {{announced}} that he would start a domestic low-cost airline. They company aimed for a 15–20% domestic market share and was named Color Air. The company launched tickets down to NOK 500 each way, and sold cheap tickets without demanding that <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> be away during a weekend.|$|E
50|$|The companions climb Pyramid Mountain, {{and meet}} the Braided Man, a {{manufacturer}} of holes, flutters (guaranteed to make any flag flutter on a windless day), and rustles for silk dresses. After exchanging gifts with him, <b>the</b> <b>travelers</b> continue upwards into the Land of the Gargoyles, which are hostile, silent, flying monsters made of wood. <b>The</b> <b>travelers</b> are able, at first, to repel their attack successfully because the Gargoyles are frightened by loud noises. However, <b>the</b> <b>travelers</b> are soon out of breath and unable to make more noise, so the Gargoyles capture them. After recuperating from <b>the</b> fight, <b>the</b> <b>travelers</b> manage to escape, and enter another tunnel.|$|R
50|$|The team succeeded <b>the</b> Little Rock <b>Travelers,</b> which {{appellation}} became defunct in 1961. <b>The</b> <b>Travelers</b> were <b>the</b> {{first professional}} sports team to claim an entire state in 1957 {{when they became}} <b>the</b> Arkansas <b>Travelers.</b> Both versions of the name derive from the old folk song, <b>The</b> Arkansas <b>Traveler.</b>|$|R
50|$|Caroline and Stefan are {{sleeping}} back at <b>the</b> <b>traveler's</b> camp but wake {{up when they}} hear <b>the</b> <b>travelers</b> changing and walk there to investigate what is going on. They watch <b>the</b> <b>travelers</b> drink Elena and Stefan's blood and then Sloan sets one of them on fire, something that leads everyone to burn since they are linked. They all die and Stefan and Caroline run away not knowing what the ritual was about.|$|R
5|$|Huletts Landing is {{a remote}} hamlet, {{accessible}} by car only via Washington County Route 6, which branches off of nearby New York State Route 22. The main road {{is known as}} Huletts Landing Road, and spawns two suffixed routes which reach different parts of Huletts Landing. The first is County Route 6A, which is better known as Lands End Road, heads southward while the other, County Route 6B, which is better known as Bluff Head Road, brings <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> northward, to locations such as Washington County Park and Huletts Landing Marina. Huletts Landing County Park is also on CR 6B.|$|E
5|$|Early {{conceptual}} {{designs of}} the Pod itself were based, as it {{existed in the}} novel, {{on one of the}} primary shapes in geometry, a dodecahedron, or a twelve-sided figure. Eventually the Pod was modified to a spherical capsule that encases <b>the</b> <b>traveler.</b> Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the Kennedy Space Center at Merritt Island adjacent to Cape Canaveral, where officials allowed them access to sites off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto Launch Complex 39 before the launch of the space shuttle. There, they concentrated on the mechanics of the elevator and the gantry area and loading arm. The resulting photographs and research were incorporated into the design of the machine's surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod itself, the interior of the elevator, and the gantry, which took almost four months to build. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks.|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, Olav Nils Sunde {{announced}} that he would establish a low-cost airline following the opening of the new airport. The company would be led by CEO Morten Andersen, who previously had been CEO of Norway Airlines, and the lawyer Stein Øxseth. Sunde would own 92% of the company through his shipping company Larvik Scandi Line, while Andersen and Øxseth would own 4% each. The company would be a brand extension of Sunde's shipping company Color Line. The company aimed at a 15–20% market share, with 1.4 million passengers annually. It was the first low-cost airline in Norway. The company launched tickets down to NOK 500 each way, and sold cheap tickets without demanding that <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> be away during a weekend. Color Air made an agreement with the British airline Air Foyle HeavyLift to operate a fleet of Boeing 737-300 aircraft.|$|E
50|$|When farm systems {{came into}} being in <b>the</b> 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>Travelers</b> were at {{different}} times affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Boston Red Sox, Boston Braves, Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Athletics, and Baltimore Orioles. After attracting fewer than 68,000 paying customers over a 77-game home schedule in 1958, <b>the</b> <b>Travelers</b> moved to Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1959 as the Shreveport Sports. In 1959, however, the New Orleans Pelicans moved to Little Rock and took <b>the</b> <b>Travelers</b> name.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, it {{went through}} a series of mergers and acquisitions. It was bought by Primerica in 1993, but the {{resulting}} company retained <b>the</b> <b>Travelers</b> name. In 1995 it became <b>The</b> <b>Travelers</b> Group. It bought Aetna's property and casualty business in 1996.|$|R
50|$|The GLBA {{permitted}} Citigroup {{to retain}} <b>the</b> <b>Travelers</b> property, casualty, and life insurance underwriting businesses beyond the five-year “divestiture” period the Federal Reserve Board could have permitted under the pre-GLBA {{form of the}} BHCA. Before that five-year period elapsed, however, Citigroup spun off <b>the</b> <b>Travelers</b> property and casualty insurance business to Citigroup’s shareholders. In 2005 Citigroup sold to Metropolitan Life <b>the</b> <b>Travelers</b> life insurance business. Commentators noted that Citigroup was left with selling insurance underwritten by third parties, a business it could have conducted without the GLBA.|$|R
5|$|Lionel is {{sentenced to}} prison for his parents' murder in season four. Lionel {{attempts}} to switch bodies with Lex using a stone from Clark's homeworld of Krypton but Clark intervenes and Lionel switches bodies with Clark instead. When he and Clark switch back, Lionel discovers his terminal liver disease is healed. Lionel is released from prison by Genevieve Teague (Jane Seymour), and begins searching for three stones of knowledge. During this quest, Lionel falls into a catatonic state after being uploaded with Kryptonian knowledge. Lionel recovers from his catatonic state in season five when the Kryptonian artificial intelligence Jor-El takes over his body to speak with Clark. With Jor-El guiding him, Lionel begins helping Clark by making excuses for Clark's behavior and unexplained disappearances throughout seasons five and six. Season seven revealed that Lionel and three other wealthy families formed the secret society called Veritas to protect an alien visitor known as <b>the</b> <b>Traveler</b> (Clark). When the secret is uncovered, Lex murders his father, realizing he has been covering up the Traveler's existence.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{the cast}} {{included}} Brent Spiner as the android Data, Gates McFadden as Doctor Beverly Crusher, Wil Wheaton as Beverly's son, Wesley Crusher. Outside of the main cast, Michael Dorn successfully auditioned to portray Lieutenant (j.g) Worf. It had originally been planned for Dorn to appear in seven {{out of the first}} thirteen episodes, but after appearing in the pilot it was decided to expand the role and add him to the main cast. Other guest actors who made their first appearances during season one included John de Lancie as Q and Eric Menyuk as <b>the</b> <b>Traveler.</b> Majel Barrett, who had previously appeared as Nurse Christine Chapel in The Original Series, made her first appearance as Lwaxana Troi during season one and voiced the Enterprise computer throughout.|$|E
25|$|Since {{one might}} not travel faster than light, one might {{conclude}} that a human can never travel further from the Earth than 40 light-years if <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> is active between the age of 20 and 60. A traveler would then {{never be able to}} reach more than the very few star systems which exist within the limit of 20–40 light-years from the Earth. This is a mistaken conclusion: because of time dilation, <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> can travel thousands of light-years during their 40 active years. If the spaceship accelerates at a constant 1g (in its own changing frame of reference), it will, after 354 days, reach speeds a little under the speed of light (for an observer on Earth), and time dilation will increase their lifespan to thousands of Earth years, seen from the reference system of the Solar System, but the traveler's subjective lifespan will not thereby change. If <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> returns to the Earth, she or he will land thousands of years into the Earth's future. Their speed will not be seen as higher than the speed of light by observers on Earth, and <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> will not measure their speed as being higher than the speed of light, but will see a length contraction of the universe in their direction of travel. And as <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> turns around to return, the Earth will seem to experience much more time than <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> does. So, while their (ordinary) coordinate speed cannot exceed c, their proper speed (distance as seen by Earth divided by their proper time) can be much greater than c. This is seen in statistical studies of muons traveling much further than c times their half-life (at rest), if traveling close to c.|$|E

50|$|But the Southern Association was in {{its death}} throes, and <b>the</b> <b>Travelers</b> went down with the entire league after the 1961 season. Little Rock did not field a team in 1962. In 1963, {{organized}} baseball returned to Little Rock with <b>the</b> Arkansas <b>Travelers</b> of <b>the</b> Triple-A International League. In both 1964 and 1965, the franchise played in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League before settling in the Double-A Texas League, where <b>the</b> <b>Travelers</b> have played since 1966. Currently, <b>the</b> Arkansas <b>Travelers</b> are <b>the</b> AA affiliate of the Seattle Mariners.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the middle}} of <b>the</b> night <b>the</b> <b>travelers</b> were {{suddenly}} forced to leave the town, and were escorted four miles up the beach by a crowd throwing rocks at them. At this point they realized that Solomon Cresson, Joseph Kirle's cabin boy, John Hilliard, and his slave, Ben, were not with them. The three remaining escorts kept them moving, repeatedly asking them if they were [...] "Nickaleer". When <b>the</b> <b>travelers</b> said they were not, the escorts hit them. On October 2 <b>the</b> <b>travelers</b> passed <b>the</b> shipwreck they had heard of.|$|R
25|$|Work in September 2011 {{included}} {{the installation of}} the turning tracks for the travelers at the western deviation saddles. These tracks allowed the continuous motion of <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> across the western end of the main span. By mid-October 2011, <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> cables were installed. A temporary group of tower stay cables to the west, intended to resist the overturning forces imposed by the bare main cable, were also installed. Subsequently, the eastern deviation saddles were installed, preparing the bridge for cable placement.|$|E
25|$|Downriver {{transport}} {{could be}} quite fast for the day. A traveler bound from Walla Walla would take the stage to Wallula, board the Colonel Wright or another steamer, then head downriver to Celilo. After a bumpy ride over the portage, <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> would arrive at The Dalles where an overnight stay would be necessary {{at one of the}} hotels. The next morning <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> would board a steamboat on the middle river, perhaps the Oneonta, for a morning run down to the Upper Cascades. There again <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> disembarked, usually on the favored north side, and rode on the portage railway to the landing at the Lower Cascades. There, a steamer, possibly the Wilson G. Hunt, then ran downriver to Portland, which <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> reached some thirty hours after leaving Walla Walla, a feat which was considered remarkable at that time. The genius of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company was to control all the boats on all the steps of the staircase, and the portages too, thus achieving a monopoly on transport in the days before there were roads or railways capable of mounting any competition. The Wright was simply superb at making money, earning as much as $2,500 a trip in passenger fares alone.|$|E
25|$|Even if a {{traveler}} {{does not need}} a visa, the aforementioned criteria {{can also be used}} by border police to refuse <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> entry into the country in question.|$|E
5000|$|By issue 9, Dawson {{could no}} longer commit to <b>The</b> <b>Travelers</b> hectic schedule, so inker James Dunn took over the art chores for issues 10 and 11. Eventually, DiGerolamo found a new artist with Chris Moreno on the [...] "Travelers #12". Sales peaked with <b>The</b> <b>Travelers</b> issue #14, which was a {{crossover}} with Knights of the Dinner Table Illustrated. Shortly thereafter, {{he took over the}} writing chores for another Kenzer comic called Everknights. DiGerolamo moved <b>The</b> <b>Travelers</b> to Wingnut Games with issue #21. By issue 22, Moreno {{could no longer}} keep doing <b>the</b> <b>Travelers</b> with his other comic work. DiGerolamo struggled with a series of other artists, with Moreno occasionally coming back to help with the art. The comic limped to the 25th issue before Wingnut had to cancel it.|$|R

25|$|Abusing the {{facility}} in any way, including cancelling the original outbound ticket and purchasing another to return {{directly to the}} inbound country, can cause <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> to be considered as an illegal resident who may be penalized and blacklisted by the PSB.|$|E
25|$|With some countries, the {{validity}} of a visa {{is not the same}} as the authorized period of stay. The visa validity then indicates the time period when entry is permitted into the country. For example, if a visa has been issued to begin on January 1 and to expire on March 30, and the typical authorized period of stay in a country is 90 days, then the 90-day authorized stay starts on the day the passenger enters the country (entrance has to be between January 1 and March 30). Thus, the latest day <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> could conceivably stay in the issuing country is July 1 (if <b>the</b> <b>traveler</b> entered on March 30). This interpretation of visas is common in the Americas.|$|E

50|$|Liv (Penelope Mitchell) {{agrees to}} work with Tyler (Michael Trevino) and Matt (Zach Roerig), but she cannot trust them not being possessed by travelers. So, she tells them {{that they have to}} stab {{themselves}} with <b>the</b> <b>traveler's</b> knife to prove it. Matt does not like the idea, but he does it since he does not have a choice. After it is proven that none of them are possessed, Liv explains that <b>the</b> <b>travelers</b> are probably taking over Mystic Falls by getting into people's bodies, and their job is to find them and stab them with <b>the</b> <b>traveler's</b> knife to kill them.|$|R
