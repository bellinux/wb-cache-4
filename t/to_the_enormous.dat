5|$|The moons of Saturn are {{numerous}} and diverse, ranging from tiny moonlets less than 1 kilometer across <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> Titan, which {{is larger than}} the planet Mercury. Saturn has 62 moons with confirmed orbits, 53 of which have names and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometers, as well as dense rings with complex orbital motions of their own. Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to be ellipsoidal in shape, though only two of those, Titan and Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium. Particularly notable among Saturn's moons are Titan, the second-largest moon (after Jupiter's Ganymede) in the Solar System, with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring dry river networks and hydrocarbon lakes found nowhere else in the solar system; and Enceladus since its chemical composition {{is similar to that of}} comets. In particular, Enceladus emits jets of gas and dust which could indicate presence of liquid water under its south pole region and could potentially harbor a global ocean under its surface.|$|E
25|$|Pretoria in South Africa is {{popularly known}} as The Jacaranda City due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> number of jacaranda trees planted as street trees and in parks and gardens.

25|$|The Three Trillion Dollar War (co-authored with Linda Bilmes) {{examines}} {{the full cost}} of the Iraq War, including many hidden costs. The book also discusses {{the extent to which these}} costs will be imposed for many years to come, paying special attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> expenditures that will be required to care for very large numbers of wounded veterans. Stiglitz was openly critical of George W. Bush at the time the book was released.|$|E

25|$|During this period, {{what was}} {{published}} in the news reflected what America was most preoccupied with: communism and the Cold War. If one asks instead how the United States got into Vietnam, attention must be paid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> strength of the Cold War consensus in the early 1960s shared by journalists and policymakers alike and to the great power of the administration to control the agenda and the framing of foreign affairs reporting.|$|E
25|$|It was copper, but as thirty {{per cent}} {{was the lowest}} that would at that time justify working, owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> charges for freight, the {{development}} did not proceed till some time later. It should be stated that this mine {{is now one of}} the most valuable portions of the great property of the Boston & Montana Mining Company, Limited. Leaving Butte, Mr. Dunn started for the Black Hills, in the summer of 1876.|$|E
25|$|Russia {{was among}} the first {{countries}} to introduce radio and television. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> size of the country Russia leads in the number of TV broadcast stations and repeaters. There were few channels in the Soviet time, but {{in the past two decades}} many new state-run and private-owned radio stations and TV channels appeared. In 2005 a state-run English language Russia Today TV started broadcasting, and its Arabic version Rusiya Al-Yaum was launched in 2007.|$|E

25|$|The generic name, Python, is a Greek word {{referring}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> serpent at Delphi slain by Apollo in Greek mythology. The specific name, sebae, is a latinization of the surname of Dutch zoologist, Albertus Seba. The subspecific name, natalensis, {{refers to}} the Natal region of South Africa. Common name usage varies with both the species and northern subspecies referred to as African rock python or simply rock python. The southern African rock python is {{sometimes referred to as}} the Natal rock python or the African python.|$|E
25|$|French {{intervention}} in Italy had created an invasion scare and Palmerston established a Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom which reported in 1860. It recommended a huge programme of fortifications {{to protect the}} Royal Navy Dockyards and ports, which Palmerston vigorously supported. Objecting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> expense, Gladstone repeatedly threatened to resign as Chancellor when the proposals were accepted. Palmerston {{said that he had}} received so many resignation letters from Gladstone that he feared that they would set fire to the chimney.|$|E
25|$|Tower {{agreed to}} allow a {{prospecting}} expedition on the Mesaba, and sent his son-in-law, R.H. Lee, and Professor Chester of Hamilton College, along with Stone. None was satisfied with the results. In 1874, the party crossed into the Vermillion range, and discovered a large outcropping of iron ore. Satisfied {{that there was a}} large vein of ore available in that area, they reported back to Tower. At that time, Tower elected not to proceed with mining the area due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> expense of prospecting, the logistical problems of mining the area and transporting the ore, and financial concerns over the recent Panic of 1873.|$|E

25|$|A {{typical circuit}} usually {{features}} {{a stretch of}} straight road on which the starting grid is situated. The pit lane, where the drivers stop for tyres, aerodynamic adjustments and minor repairs (such as changing the car's nose due to front wing damage) during the race, retirements from the race, and where the teams work on the cars before the race, is normally located next to the starting grid. The layout {{of the rest of}} the circuit varies widely, although in most cases the circuit runs in a clockwise direction. Those few circuits that run anticlockwise (and therefore have predominantly left-handed corners) can cause drivers neck problems due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> lateral forces generated by F1 cars pulling their heads in the opposite direction to normal.|$|E
25|$|However, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> {{size of the}} Australasian strewn field, {{the impact}} crater has been conjectured to be {{significantly}} larger than the known ones. Schmidt and Wasson (1993) suggested {{it could be a}} 14–17km crater beneath the Mekong Valley, Schnetzler (1996) considered a 35–40km structure in southern Laos, Hartung and Koeberl (1994) proposed the elongated 100km x 35km Tonlé Sap lake in Cambodia (visible in the map at the side), while Glass (1994) estimated it to be between 32 and 114km in diameter in Cambodia. Glass (1999) also suggested southern Laos or an adjacent area as a possible source. More recently, Lee and Wei (2000) gave its size as 90 to 116km and P. Ma et al. (2001) using beryllium-10 postulated the crater as between southern Laos and Hainan, possibly within the Gulf of Tonkin.|$|E
25|$|During the 1939–1945 Emergency {{extensive}} {{postal censorship}} took {{place under the}} control of the Department of Defence whose powers were conferred by the Emergency Powers Act 1939. Civilian mail was controlled by the approximately 200 censors who worked in Dublin's Exchequer Street and who had all been vetted by the G2 Directorate of Intelligence and the Gardaí. Using the Black List and White List to target certain mail, the small staff were unable to effect 100% censorship; however, continental European mail was all reviewed, as was all incoming and outbound airmail. Following the overthrow of France and the Low Countries in May 1940, the British instigated full terminal mail censorship but the Irish were unable to look at more than about 10% due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> staff this would have required. Covert censorship of mail between Northern Ireland and the south was effected by warrants obtained by G2, who also obtained warrants from the Minister for Justice for internal mail oversight.|$|E

25|$|The {{eruption}} of modernity was also {{expressed by the}} growing influence of new political ideas from Western Europe. The Young Turk revolution of 1908 with its bases in Salonica proclaimed a constitutional monarchy. The Jews did not remain indifferent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> social and political change of the era, and were active most often in the social rather than national sphere. As the city began {{to take in the}} broader modern influences of the early 20th century, the movement of workers to organize and engage in social struggles for the improvement of working conditions began to spread. An attempt at union of different nationalities within a single labor movement took place with the formation of the Socialist Workers' Federation led by Avraam Benaroya, a Jew from Bulgaria, who initially started publication of a quadrilingual Journal of the worker aired in Greek, Turkish, Bulgarian and other languages. However, the Balkan context was conducive to division, and affected the movement; after the departure of Bulgarian element, the Federation was heavily composed of Jews.|$|E

500|$|Historian Richard Woodman {{has noted}} that this action {{illustrates}} both {{the dominance of the}} Royal Navy and its high standards at this stage in the war, stating that [...] "The coincidental appearance of four frigates in the vast Atlantic testifies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> resources the British put into the prosecution of the war. That the four frigate captains proceeded to act in such perfect concert is further evidence, if it were needed, of the shared standards of mutual help and assistance".|$|E
