5|$|Aspasia {{appears in}} several {{significant}} works of modern literature. Her romantic attachment with Pericles has inspired {{some of the}} most famous novelists and poets of the last centuries.

In 1835 Lydia Maria Child, an American abolitionist, novelist, and journalist, published Philothea, a classical romance set in the days of Pericles and Aspasia. <b>This</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> regarded as the most successful and elaborate of the author's productions, because the female characters, especially Aspasia, are portrayed with great beauty and delicacy.|$|E
5|$|Chavundaraya II, a Shaiva Brahmin (Brahmin {{devotee of}} the god Shiva) by faith and a protege of King Jayasimha II, wrote Lokopakara (c.1025) in the champu metre.

5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual's perception of society. <b>This</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society. A frame {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.|$|E

5|$|His Dwie drogi (Two ways, 1959) {{about the}} January Uprising of the 1860s {{represent}} the latest historical period he has tackled.

His Rozważania o wojnie domowej (1978; Thoughts on Civil War) were the last book he has finished; unlike majority of his other works, <b>this</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> ostensibly about the civil war (Chouannerie) in Brittany, France.

5|$|Recuerdos de Provincia (Recollections of a Provincial Past), 1850. In {{this second}} autobiography, Sarmiento {{displays}} a stronger effort to include familial links and ties to his past, {{in contrast to}} Mi defensa, choosing to relate himself to San Juan and his Argentine heritage. Sarmiento discusses growing up in rural Argentina with basic ideologies and simple livings. Recuerdos discusses his Similar to Facundo, Sarmiento uses previous dossiers filed against himself by enemies to assist in writing Recuerdos and therefore fabricating an autobiography based on these files and from his own memory. Sarmiento's persuasion in <b>this</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> substantial.

5|$|We {{know more}} about Lancaster's {{character}} than of most of his contemporaries through his memoirs, the Livre de seyntz medicines (Book of the Holy Doctors). <b>This</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> a highly personal treatise on matters of religion and piety, but it also contains details of historical interest. It, among other things, revealed that Lancaster, {{at the age of}} 44 when he wrote the book in 1354, suffered from gout. The book is primarily a devotional work though; it is organised around seven wounds which Henry claims to have, representing the seven sins. Lancaster confesses to his sins, explains various real and mythical medical remedies in terms of their theological symbolism, and exhorts the reader to greater morality.|$|E
