5|$|The poverty Henson {{had seen}} during his {{six months in}} Birkenhead gave him a strong impetus <b>to</b> <b>minister</b> <b>to</b> the poor. In 1887, after being ordained deacon, he {{took charge of the}} Oxford House Settlement, a high-church mission in Bethnal Green, a poor area of the East End of London. While in this post he honed his {{speaking}} skills in public debates with atheist orators, many from the National Secular Society's Bethnal Green office.|$|E
5|$|Feeling a {{vocation}} <b>to</b> <b>minister</b> <b>to</b> the urban poor, Henson {{served in the}} East End of London and Barking before becoming chaplain of an ancient hospice in Ilford in 1895. In 1900 he {{was appointed to the}} high-profile post of vicar of St Margaret's, Westminster and canon of Westminster Abbey. While there, and as Dean of Durham (1913–18), he wrote prolifically and sometimes controversially. The Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church took exception to his liberal theological views, which some regarded as heretical, and sought unsuccessfully in 1917 to block his appointment as Bishop of Hereford.|$|E

5|$|In 1841, Father Lucien Galtier {{was sent}} <b>to</b> <b>minister</b> <b>to</b> the Catholic French Canadians and {{established}} a chapel, named for his favorite saint, Paul the Apostle, on the bluffs above Lambert's Landing. Galtier intended for the settlement to adopt the name Saint Paul {{in honor of the}} new chapel. In 1847, a New York educator named Harriet Bishop moved to the area and opened the city's first school. The Minnesota Territory was formalized in 1849 and Saint Paul named as its capital. In 1857, the territorial legislature voted to move the capital to Saint Peter. However, Joe Rolette, a territorial legislator, stole the physical text of the approved bill and went into hiding, thus preventing the move. On May 11, 1858, Minnesota was admitted to the union as the thirty-second state, with Saint Paul as the capital.|$|E

25|$|In 1915, {{during the}} First World War, South African forces invaded and the {{following}} year an Anglican priest, Nelson Fogarty, established the first Anglican presence, initially <b>to</b> <b>minister</b> <b>to</b> the South African troops and civilians who had followed the military occupation. After the war South Africa administered the territory under a League of Nations mandate and Nelson Fogarty {{began to think of}} ways of making the Anglican presence more permanent by evangelising the local people. It was established that the Finnish mission in Ovamboland had not really established churches among the Kwanyama people who lived in northern Ovamboland and southern Angola.|$|E

25|$|In AD 371 Martin was {{acclaimed}} {{bishop of}} Tours, where he impressed {{the city with}} his demeanour.

According to one version, he was so unwilling to be made bishop that he hid in a barn full of geese, but their cackling at his intrusion gave him away to the crowd; that may account for complaints by a few that his appearance was too disheveled to be commensurate with a bishopric, but the critics were hugely outnumbered.|$|E
