5|$|Clark Green (Clark Duke) hits on Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) by {{dangling}} a fake newscaster job. After receiving some not-so-helpful {{advice from}} her coworkers—especially Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Darryl, {{who is now}} assistant regional manager—Clark invites Erin to his apartment for the fake audition. However, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), who has come to dislike Clark, invites himself and Andy along under the pretense of helping with the audition, ruining Clark's seduction plan. Andy ends up throwing himself into the fake plan and more or less dismissing Erin, who in turns goes out for dinner with Pete and appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enjoying</b> time spent with him.|$|E

25|$|In {{her version}} of events, she had fled civil war in Somalia, was forced into an {{arranged}} marriage with a man whom she had never met, and was not present at her own wedding. Upon escaping she was forced into hiding in the Netherlands, for her ex-husband and father's brothers would have been by Somali custom, required to perform an honor killing. The accounts of various witnesses varied greatly from hers. According to them, she left Somalia prior to any mass violence, and led a comfortable, upper-middle class life in neighboring Kenya, where she attended a Muslim Girls' school and received a full western-style education with focus on the Humanities and Science, her brother attended a Christian school, she lied to the Dutch immigration service about coming from Somalia {{in order not to}} be sent back to Kenya, and they allege she met her husband a few days before her wedding. After several meetings with him, they allege she agreed to the marriage, even though her mother said Ayaan should finish her education so she could afford to leave him if the marriage should have been unsuccessful. They also allege that Hirsi Ali was present at the wedding, something her brother later denied, and according to several witnesses appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enjoying</b> herself. Hirsi Ali denies all of this. On her way to Canada, she says she travelled to Holland by train during a stopover in Germany, and applied for political asylum. During her stay in Holland she regularly received letters from her father. The documentary also quoted several native Somalians as saying there is no tradition of honor killing in Somalia, something that is disputed.|$|E
5000|$|Some things <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enjoyed</b> (in Latin, frui), {{and others}} <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used (uti). Things we <b>enjoy</b> <b>are</b> those we find good in themselves, and things we use {{are those that}} are good for the sake of {{something}} else. The only thing that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>is</b> God.

500|$|The {{first signs}} of {{internal}} disquiet towards Brown's policies surfaced in May 2008. The 2007 budgethis last as Chancellorabolished the 10% income tax rate for the lowest earners (5.1million people), increasing their rate to the next highest, 20%. Earners who fell within the 22% tax rate band had their rate reduced to 20%, and tax allowances were also made for over-65s. These measures came into effect in April 2008. The [...] "10p tax rate cut" [...] as it was commonly referred to, was sharply criticised by Frank Field and several other backbenchers. Field also said that Brown did not seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enjoying</b> his job. Health Secretary Alan Johnson believed that Field was motivated primarily by a personal dislike of Brown, and Field later apologised, {{saying that he had}} regretted allowing his campaign to become personal. Chancellor Alistair Darling cut the tax rate for 22 million people and borrowed around £2.7billion to reimburse those on lower and middle incomes who had suffered.|$|E
500|$|The show {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Andrew Miller of The Pitch stated [...] " [...] at Sandstone proved that many [...] criticisms are off-base observations {{from people who}} have never actually attended one of these stars' shows. The music came from a talented band, not a DAT, and the bass lines to such songs as [...] "... Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "The Beat Goes On" [...] rose to a funky growl in the live setting. For another, Spears' vocals were the real thing, as she sang in an alluringly low tone [...] but capably hit the high notes , however, she left the upper-octave duties to her background singers [...] during Spears' most strenuous dance routines". Richard Leiby of The Washington Post believed that the show [...] " [...] great". Dan Aquilante of the New York Post said that Spears [...] "seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enjoying</b> the show as much as her fans. Maybe it was the Mariah-like cowboy hat pushed back on her noggin or possibly the stripper's pole borrowed from Madonna's prop closet, [...] Spears was in her element and having a ball". Letta Tayler of Newsday said [...] "For half the show, she remained the old Britney, the budding teen who dreamed of romance. But the rest of the time, she was a full-throttle tease, with sprayed- on clothes, a hard-edged attitude and a harder edge to her techno and hip-hop- coated pop to match".|$|E
500|$|While Petre Dumitriu is {{motivated}} by his pursuit of discipline, his wife preserves her sophistication, reading the works of Marcel Proust, playing the harpsichord, employing a nanny to educate her children, and comparing the surrounding landscape with Japan's Mount Fuji. Variety calls her [...] "sensitive-yet-flamboyant in the mold of Zelda Fitzgerald". To her husband's assurance {{that they were not}} going to spend long in Southern Dobruja, she replies: [...] "I like it here." [...] In pursuing this path, she only manages to widen the gap between her and most other characters. This rift is made apparent by a number of omens: unknown attackers throw rocks into the Dumitrius' house, while the vegetables she planted in the garden prove unpalatable. Confronted with these signs, Von Debretsy still attempts to make the best of the situation; online film critic James Berardinelli notes: [...] " [...] does her best to make a happy home for her family, despite stray bullets that shatter mirrors." [...] Bulgarian locals, taken as hostages by the military, are made to work on the garden. Their labor brings immediate improvement to the crop, and, upset by their condition, Marie-Thérèse decides to pay them out of her own pocket, serves them tea and eventually befriends them. In a scene that provided the original title for Petru Dumitriu's book chapter ("The Salad"), she invites Ipsilanti and other officers to dinner, and they are all shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enjoying</b> the salad provided by Bulgarian labor. However, the episode also renews tensions between Ipsilanti and his Hungarian host, when she expresses her appreciation of her servants' work and attempts to intervene on their behalf.|$|E

500|$|Multiple reviewers {{highlighted}} Hemmings's {{association with}} the school. Cowie (British Journal of Educational Studies) wrote that although Neill did not want disciples, Hemmings [...] "accepts generally the 'Summerhill idea and would fit the role. Nicholas Tucker (New Statesman) too noted the book as [...] "very one-sided, verging on the uncritical" [...] despite its readability and signs of thorough research. He said that a balanced account of Summerhill was elusive because of the [...] "sensationalized" [...] press and [...] "rosy" [...] recollections of Neill and his former pupils, similar to the memoirs of [...] "Old Boys' clubs elsewhere". He wrote, however, that Hemmings's position was understandable when considering the criticism that Summerhill and Neill withstood from [...] "conventional educational wisdom" [...] and [...] "horrified hearsay", which had turned the school into [...] "a type of scholastic folk myth" [...] to set straight. Still, Tucker saw less cause for Summerhill's defense {{by the time of}} publication as Neill had wider acceptance. He had become a powerful figure in education and his school a template for the American free school movement. Cowie wrote that Neill seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enjoying</b> greater acceptance in his later life as Summerhill was [...] "losing its uniqueness as 'that dreadful school. Nordberg (Best Sellers) said that while Hemmings has some criticism for Neill and [...] "open education", [...] "he is basically an enthusiast" [...] who wrote a [...] "sympathetic portrayal". Even from this sympathetic angle, Nordberg felt that Neill came across as [...] "the child of an overly strict and demanding father who has spent {{the rest of his life}} in a rather one-dimensional crusade, more visceral than rational, against authority in all forms." [...] Altogether, Nordberg wrote, Fifty Years succeeds in its [...] "systematic, scholarly look at the Summerhill idea" [...] but fails to provide [...] "a balanced, profound look" [...] at its counterpart: [...] "need for restraint, rationality, and responsibility in the world".|$|E

[...] The episode features Dr. Westphall occasionally breaking the fourth wall and speaking {{directly to the}} viewer, a la the [...] "Stage Manager" [...] character in Our Town (the episode title and its location are nods to the Thornton Wilder play).|$|E

[...] Five years elapsed before Weber got the opportunity again. While Weber and Gantz appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enjoying</b> domestic harmony in March 1930, soon after Weber was separated from Gantz and was living {{with her mother and}} nephew in Los Angeles. In 1931, Gantz sold the El Dorado ranch to C. Stanley Chapman, the son of Charles C. Chapman. By 1932, Weber was still separated from Gantz and was managing an apartment building in Fullerton, California.|$|E

2500|$|Radha-Krishna Dev has {{a special}} place in the Swaminarayan Sampraday as Swaminarayan himself {{referred}} to Radha Krishna in the Shikshapatri he wrote. Further, he himself ordered the construction of temples in which Radha Krishna have been installed as deities. Swaminarayan [...] "explained that Krishna appears in many forms. When he is together with Radha, he is regarded as supreme lord under the name of Radha-Krishna; with Rukmini he is known as Lakshmi-Narayana." [...] The first temple constructed in the sect, built in Ahmedabad in AD 1822, houses the images of Nara Narayana, forms of Arjuna and Krishna, in the central shrine. The shrine on the left of the hall has murtis of Radha Krishna. According to the philosophy of the tradition there were many female companions of Krishna, gopis, but out of all of them Radha was considered to be the perfect devotee. Those who wish to come close to Krishna must cultivate the devotional qualities of Radha. According to theory the sect has set aside Goloka as the supreme heaven or abode (in fact, in some of their temples, such as the Mumbai Temple, the murtis installed are those of Shri Gaulokvihari and Radhikaji), because there Krishna is supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enjoying</b> himself with his Gopis, who according to the Swaminarayana sampradaya the milkmaids with whom Krishna danced; his relations with them symbolize the relation of God with the devotee in reciprocation.|$|E
2500|$|After a few {{paragraphs}} {{in which}} he focuses on the serendipitous nature of such outcomes, which serve him to avert producing further damage, Creangă moves on to describe his first employment: pulled out of school by Ștefan, the boy is enlisted in the village's textile trade, and becomes a spinner. It is there that he meets Măriuca, a daughter his age, for whom he develops a sympathy. She jokingly assigns him the nickname Ion Torcălău ("Ion the Spinster"), which causes him some embarrassment for being shared with a Romani man, and therefore crossing a traditional ethnic divide. Nică is shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enjoying</b> the work {{despite the fact that}} it is traditionally performed by women, but he is irritated by additional tasks such as babysitting his youngest sibling. Disobeying his mother's word, the boy leaves the cradle unattended and runs away to bathe in the river. After recounting the superstitious rituals performed by children during such escapades (such as dripping water from one's years onto stones, of which one is God's and the other the Devil's), the narrator describes being caught in the act by Smaranda, who punishes him by taking hold of all his clothes and leaving him to return naked through the village. This he manages following an elaborate route, from one hiding place to another, and avoiding being bitten by angry dogs by standing absolutely still for a long interval. After reaching his house, the narrator indicates, [...] "I tidied up and cleaned the house as well as any grown-up girl", a behavior earning praises from his mother. The chapter ends with another overview, itself concluded with the words: [...] "I myself was placed on this Earth like a clay figure endowed with eyes, a handful of animated humus from Humulești, who's never been handsome before age twenty, wise before age thirty, nor rich before age forty. But neither was I ever as poor as I was this year, last year and throughout life!" ...|$|E
