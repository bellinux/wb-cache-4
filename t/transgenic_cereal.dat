40|$|The {{regeneration}} of differentiated cereal plant {{cells from}} callus remains a major limiting step in obtaining {{high numbers of}} cereal clones or inde-pendent <b>transgenic</b> <b>cereal</b> lines (Eudes et al. 2003). Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) {{is one of the}} recalcitrant cereal crops with {{only a limited number of}} tissues suitable for in vitro culture and plant regenera-tion (Ganeshan et al. 2003). Barley improvement through genetic transformation and in vitro tech-niques requires establishment of an efficient and reproducible plant regeneration system (Dahleen and Bregitzer 2002, Chang et al. 2003). These tech-niques have the potential to assist in breeding improved barley cultivars. Somatic embryos are derived from a single cell whereas organogeni...|$|E
40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) is a plant disease with serious {{economic}} and health impacts. It {{is caused by}} fungal species belonging to the genus Fusarium and the mycotoxins they produce. Although it has proved difficult to combat this dis-ease, one strategy that has been examined is the introduction of an indigenous fungal protective gene into cereals such as wheat barley and rice. Thus far the gene of choice has been tri 101 whose gene product catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to the C 3 hydroxyl moiety of several trichothecene mycotoxins. In vitro this {{has been shown to}} reduce the toxicity of the toxins by 100 -fold but has demonstrated limited resistance to FHB in <b>transgenic</b> <b>cereal.</b> To understand the molecular basis for the differences between in vitro and in vivo resistance the three-dimensional structures and kinetic properties of two TRI 101 ortholog...|$|E
30|$|A {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made for the identification of genes and their products, which {{play an important role in}} the plant system for overcoming the unfavourable situations of abiotic stresses (Cushman and Bohnert 2000). There are several papers published, that documents intensive works on genetic engineering for abiotic stress tolerance and development of transgenics using different candidate genes (Wu et al. 2005; Roy et al. 2011; Reguera et al. 2012). A number of studies for the identification and characterization of genes have also been done in STGs in response to salinity. Subudhi and Baisakh (2011) reported a number of candidate genes encoding transcription factors, ion transporters, osmoprotectants and antioxidants from salt tolerant Spartina alterniflora, upregulated during salt stress. Earlier, analysis of the expression pattern of other genes like cation transport protein (SaCTP), vacuolar ATPase (SaV-ATPase), and plasma membrane protein 3 (SaPMP 3) in both leaf and root tissues by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) revealed clear upregulation under salt stress compared to the unstressed control (Baisakh et al. 2008). A number of genes have also been isolated and characterized from Porteresia coarctata that are related to the salt tolerance property of the plant, specially the genes operational in inositol metabolic pathway such as myoinositol phosphate synthase (PcMIPS) has been analysed in details (Sengupta and Majumder 2009). A putative UDP galactose epimerase gene and a metallothioneine gene was reported to play an important role in conferring salt tolerance to salt tolerant plants of Paspalum vaginatum (Endo et al. 2005). Wang et al. (2007) identified 162 unique transcripts corresponding to possible salt-related genes in P tenuiflora. Expression of transcripts encoding an aquaporin, V-ATPase subunit B, and the Na+/H+ antiporter NHX was characterized from the salt tolerant Festuca rubra ssp. litoralis under salt stress (Diedhiou et al. 2009). Characterization of salt induced ESTs in salt tolerant Aeluropus littoralis revealed that about 20 % of the ESTs bear no resemblance in the protein database and are thus novel (Zouari et al. 2007). The analysis of such ESTs could be important in the development of salt tolerant <b>transgenic</b> <b>cereal</b> crops. A significant number of similar studies on other STGs and also in the glycophytic grasses is required to generated a huge database of genes and ESTs that has salt tolerant attributes.|$|E
40|$|Direct gene {{transfer}} {{can be obtained}} by electroporating a mixture of protoplasts and DNA, resulting in the DNA being incorporated into the protoplasts without loss of their viability.

40|$|The genomes of cereals {{are one of}} {{the many}} that humans have remodelled through careful {{selection}} and breeding-criteria such as high yield, disease tolerance or environmental adaptability. Biotechnology offers another avenue for genome modification by transferring one or more transgenes for end-use quality or other applications. To maximise the benefits of this technology it would be highly desirable to generate the desired <b>transgenic</b> <b>cereals</b> with multi-traits (gene stacking) conferred by many genes under control of as many promoters. However, use of the same promoter to drive more than one transgene, can result in impaired expression of one or more transgenes through a process of homologous sequence-dependent gene silencing (transcriptional silencing). The need to stack more than one trait in the same seed tissue of rice will require the use of homologous or heterologous promoters with the same tissue specificities but with little homology. We report the spatial and temporal control of expression by several promoters in <b>transgenic</b> <b>cereals</b> and their potential to drive high levels of transgene expression in the cereal grain...|$|R

40|$|The wheat grain {{comprises}} {{three groups}} of major components, starch, protein, and cell wall polysaccharides (dietary fiber), {{and a range of}} minor components that may confer benefits to human health. Detailed analyses of dietary fiber and other bioactive components were carried out under the EU FP 6 HEALTHGRAIN program on 150 bread wheat lines grown on a single site, 50 lines of other wheat species and other cereals grown on the same site, and 23 − 26 bread wheat lines grown in six environments. Principal component analysis allowed the 150 bread wheat lines to be classified on the basis of differences in their contents of bioactive components and wheat species (bread, durum, spelt, emmer, and einkorn wheats) to be clearly separated from related cereals (barley, rye, and oats). Such multivariate analyses could be used to define substantial equivalence when novel (including <b>transgenic)</b> <b>cereals</b> are considered...|$|R
30|$|PA can be {{eliminated}} from food by soaking and sprouting seeds, thereby activating endogenous phytase enzymes that hydrolyze PA (Lestienne et al. 2005; Kumari et al. 2014; Mahesh et al. 2015). Although soaking for 24  h at 30  °C {{could be used}} to increase Zn bioavailability, this method is not effective for Fe as such a treatment tends to leach Fe ions to the medium (Lestienne et al. 2005). Soaking followed by cooking is an effective means to significantly reduce the PA content of legumes (Huma et al. 2008). Processing techniques, for example milling, will eliminate PA but also remove the majority of minerals (Liang et al. 2008) and, thus, are not considered a suitable option for PA removal. <b>Transgenic</b> <b>cereals</b> that express and accumulate microbial phytase in seeds have been developed but these materials require laborious processing steps before the product can be fed to animals (Brinch-Pedersen et al. 2003). Therefore, more simple, economical and sustainable solutions are required (Kuwano et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|As {{the most}} commercially {{valuable}} cereal grown worldwide and the best-characterized in genetic terms, maize was predictably the first target for transformation among the important crops. Indeed, {{the first attempt}} at transformation of any plant was conducted on maize (1). These early efforts, however, were inevitably unsuccessful, since at that time, there were no reliable methods to permit the introduction of DNA into a cell, the expression of that DNA, and the identification of progeny derived from such a “transgenic” cell (2). Almost 20 years later, these technologies were finally combined, and the first <b>transgenic</b> <b>cereals</b> were produced. In the last few years, methods have become increasingly efficient, and transgenic maize has now been produced from protoplasts {{as well as from}} Agrobacterium-medieited or “Biolistic” delivery to embryogenic tissue (for a general comparison of methods used for maize, the reader is referred to a recent review—ref. 3). The present chapter will describe probably the simplest of the available procedures, namely the delivery of DNA to the recipient cells by vortexing them in the presence of silicon carbide (SiC) whiskers (this name will be used in preference to the term “fiber,” since it more correctly describes the single crystal nature of the material). ...|$|R
40|$|This review summarises {{the history}} of <b>transgenic</b> (GM) <b>cereals,</b> principally maize, and then focuses on the {{scientific}} literature published {{in the last two}} years. It describes the production of GM cereals with modified traits, divided into input traits and output traits. The first category includes herbicide tolerance and insect resistance, and resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses; the second includes altered grains for starch, protein or nutrient quality, the use of cereals for the production of high value medical or other products, and the generation of plants with improved efficiency of biofuel production. Using data from field trial and patent databases the review considers the diversity of GM lines being tested for possible future development. It also summarises the dichotomy of response to GM products in various countries, describes the basis for the varied public acceptability of such products, and assesses the development of novel breeding techniques in the light of current GM regulatory procedures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Particle {{bombardment}} {{has been}} successfully employed for obtaining <b>transgenics</b> in <b>cereals</b> in general and wheat in particular. Most of these procedures employ immature embryos which are not available throughout the year. The present investigation utilizes mature seeds as the starting material and the calli raised from the hexaploid Triticum aestivum and tetraploid Triticum durum display a high regeneration response and were therefore used as the target tissue for genetic transformation by the biolistic approach. Results Mature embryo-derived calli of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, cv. CPAN 1676) and durum wheat (T. durum, cv. PDW 215) were double bombarded with 1. 1 gold microprojectiles coated with pDM 302 and pAct 1 -F at a target distance of 6 cm. Southern analysis using the bar gene as a probe revealed the integration of transgenes in the T 0 transformants. The bar gene was active in both T 0 and T 1 generations as evidenced by phosphinothricin leaf paint assay. Approximately 30 % and 33 % primary transformants of T. aestivum and T. durum, respectively, were fertile. The transmission of bar gene to T 1 progeny was demonstrated by PCR analysis of germinated seedlings with primers specific to the bar gene. Conclusions The transformation frequency obtained was 8. 56 % with T. aestivum and 10 % with T. durum. The optimized protocol was subsequently used for {{the introduction of the}} barley gene encoding a late embryogenesis abundant protein (HVA 1) in T. aestivum and T. durum. The presence of the HVA 1 transgene was confirmed by Southern analysis in the T 0 generation in case of Triticum aestivum, and T 0 and T 1 generation in Triticum durum. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comIn this study the frequency and distance of gene flow from transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) to non-transgenic wheat and barley crops was investigated under local field conditions. Trials were conducted in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and in South Australia (SA). Gene flow from transgenic wheat was confirmed at frequencies of 0. 012 % and 0. 0037 % in the ACT and SA, respectively. In both trials gene flow occurred over distances of less than 12 m. Gene flow was also detected from transgenic barley at a frequency of 0. 005 %, over a distance of less than 12 m. The results show that under Australian field conditions, gene flow occurs at extremely low frequencies and over very short distances. Physical separation of <b>transgenic</b> and non-transgenic <b>cereal</b> crops by greater than 12 m should ensure that contamination of adjacent non-transgenic cereal crops remains less than 0. 02 %, well below the level permitted under Australian regulations.

40|$|Advances {{have been}} made in the {{development}} of drought-tolerant <b>transgenic</b> plants, including <b>cereals.</b> Rice, one of the most important cereals, is considered to be a critical target for improving drought tolerance, as present-day rice cultivation requires large quantities of water and as drought-tolerant rice plants should be able to grow in small amounts of water. Numerous transgenic rice plants showing enhanced drought tolerance have been developed to date. Such genetically engineered plants have generally been developed using genes encoding proteins that control drought regulatory networks. These proteins include transcription factors, protein kinases, receptor-like kinases, enzymes related to osmoprotectant or plant hormone synthesis, and other regulatory or functional proteins. Of the drought-tolerant transgenic rice plants described in this review, approximately one-third show decreased plant height under non-stressed conditions or in response to abscisic acid treatment. In cereal crops, plant height is a very important agronomic trait directly affecting yield, although the improvement of lodging resistance should also be taken into consideration. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of plant growth reduction under drought stress conditions holds promise for developing transgenic plants that produce high yields under drought stress conditions. Plant growth rates are reduced more rapidly than photosynthetic activity under drought conditions, implying that plants actively reduce growth in response to drought stress. In this review, we summarize studies on molecular regulatory networks involved in response to drought stress. In a separate section, we highlight progress in the development of transgenic drought-tolerant rice plants, with special attention paid to field trial investigations...|$|R
