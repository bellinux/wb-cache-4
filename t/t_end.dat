40|$|Haemangiomas are benign tumours {{occurring}} {{in up to}} 12 % of Caucasians, particularly in infancy and childhood. In the present study, two variant cell lines were isolated from murine endothelioma cells. One variant, named <b>t.</b> <b>End.</b> 1 V(high), represented 16. 9 % of the parental cell population and was selected by virtue of high expression levels of integrin alphavbeta 3 and reduced capacity to endocytose acetylated low-density lipoproteins (Ac-LDLs). A second variant, named <b>t.</b> <b>End.</b> 1 V(low), represented 38. 8 % of the parental endothelioma cell line, expressed low levels of alphavbeta 3 integrin, {{and was able to}} endocytose Ac-LDL. These phenotypic modifications were stable and correlated with specific morphological and functional properties of the two variant cell lines. While the <b>t.</b> <b>End.</b> 1 V(high) cells induced the formation of large haemangiomas when injected subcutaneously into mice, the <b>t.</b> <b>End.</b> 1 V(low) cells formed haemangiocytomas. When compared with <b>t.</b> <b>End.</b> 1 V(low) cells, the <b>t.</b> <b>End.</b> 1 V(high) cells showed increased migratory capacity, lacked an inflammatory response, and formed cord-like structures in fibrin gels. In contrast, the <b>t.</b> <b>End.</b> 1 V(low) cells organized into cysts with a lumen in fibrin gels. They rarely formed blood-filled haemangiomas in vivo and recruited host smooth muscle cells, a phenomenon typical for vessel wall maturation of resting cells. These data suggest that Ac-LDL uptake and the level of alphavbeta 3 integrin expression are linked to the ability of endothelial cells to form large haemangiomas in vivo...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. This study {{tested the}} {{correlation}} of QT and JT dispersion and other potentially useful electrocardiographic (ECG) indexes with dispersion of repolarization and recovery time. Background. Dispersion of ventricular repolarization is currently being assessed noninvasively from the surface ECG by means of QT and JT dispersion, although their correlation with dispersion of repolarization as measured directly from the myocardium is not well established. Methods. Multiple monophasic action potentials were recorded simultaneously with a 12 -lead ECG from isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. The QT and JT dispersion was compared with the dispersion of monophasic action potential duration at 90 % repolarization (APD 90) and with dispersion of recovery time. As new ECG indexes, total T wave area, T wave area after the peak (late T wave area) and T peak to <b>T</b> <b>end</b> interval were also tested. Results. The QT and JT dispersion showed a significant correlation with the dispersion of APD 90 and the dispersion of recovery time (r values between 0. 58 and 0. 64, respectively, p < 0. 001). However, total T wave area showed better correlation, respectively, with dispersion of APD 90 and recovery time (r = 0. 79 and r = 0. 82, p < 0. 0001), as did late T wave area (r = 0. 81 and r = 0. 81, p < 0. 0001) and T peak to <b>T</b> <b>end</b> interval (r = 0. 81 and r = 0. 82, p < 0. 0001). Conclusions. The JT and QT dispersion correlate significantly with dispersion of APD 90 and recovery time. The ECG assessment of dispersion of repolarization can be improved by three new ECG dispersion indexes: T peak to <b>T</b> <b>end</b> interval, total T wave area and late T wave area. These new indexes should be tested clinically...|$|E

40|$|QT {{dispersion}} {{from the}} 12 lead ECG {{has been extensively}} evaluated as a risk parameter in pts prone to arrhythmias. Usually, this parameter is assessed directly from the ECG tracing {{by means of a}} magnifying glass and a digitizing pad with reproducibility and accuracy not being optimal. We therefore developed a software program with a graphical interface permitting conversion of a scanned image of the ECG on paper to a digital ECG function (sampling rate 500 or 1000 Hz) which can then be analyzed by a second interactive computer program for standard ECG intervals, QT dispersion and other repolarization parameters (JTpeak, T areas, T peak to <b>T</b> <b>end</b> interval). Digitally available ECGs can also be converted to a format analyzable by the program. The respective signals are processed channel-by-channel with enlarged high resolution display on a 20 ″ computer screen. The computer program uses customized algorithms to detect important features of the ECG waveforms (Q onset, J point, T peak, and <b>T</b> <b>end</b> for ECG signals) and then displays colored vertical spikes superimposed on the signal marking these points with high resolution for confirmation or manual correction by the observer. The processed data are automatically written to a spreadsheet for further processing. With this methodology accuracy and reproducibility of QT intervals and ECG parameters of dispersion of repolarization can be increased and parameters not easily measurable on paper can be determined (T wave areas) ...|$|E

40|$|IntroductionT wave {{morphological}} changes before {{onset of}} ventricular arrhythmia are poorly known. ICD-stored intracardiac electrograms (EGM) present {{a unique opportunity}} for detecting temporal changes in repolarisation before initiation of VT/VF. Methods 57 implanted patients with St Jude Medical ICDs (45 men, 64 ± 12 yo, mean EF 34 ± 15 %) were prospectively enrolled. Eleven different T wave parameters were extracted from EGM (T amplitude, T peak time, <b>T</b> <b>end</b> time, T duration between baseline crossing and between points of maximal slopes, T peak to <b>T</b> <b>end,</b> maximal ascending and descending slopes, timing of points of maximal slopes and T wave area). Values of each parameter in recordings prior to VT/VF were compared to control recordings sharing comparable QRS and T wave morphology and similar heart rate in the same pts. Results 23 VT/VF episodes (24 ± 13 beats) and 13 baseline (25 ± 9 beats) (ns) were analyzed in 12 pts (1, 9 episode/pt). Mean heart rate was 71 ± 17 bpm for episodes and 66 ± 16 bpm for baseline recordings (ns). Significant {{differences were found in}} T wave amplitude, T wave maximal slopes, T peak time and timing of the T wave maximal ascending slope (although ns when corrected by the heart rate). ConclusionsT wave amplitude is higher, T wave slopes are steeper and initial parts of the T wave are earlier before ventricular arrhythmia compared to baseline. Detection of T wave changes prior to VT/VF might be useful in predicting imminent arrhythmia occurrence. Example of T wave changes before V...|$|E
