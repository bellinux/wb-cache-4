5|$|The Red Sox {{acquired}} {{starting pitcher}} Josh Beckett, who pitched a complete game shutout for the Marlins against the Yankees {{to end the}} 2003 World Series, {{the end of the}} 2005 season. The Yankees would follow with their own off-season acquisition of former Red Sox outfielder Johnny Damon, a fan-favorite during his four years in Boston. Damon returned to Fenway Park the following May to a mix of cheers and boos as he <b>tipped</b> <b>his</b> helmet to the fans.|$|E
5|$|Once the 1999 season started, {{a moment}} of peace {{occurred}} between the fans. Yankees manager Joe Torre returned to Fenway Park for his first game following a battle with prostate cancer. While the managers were exchanging lineup cards, the Boston crowd gave Torre a long standing ovation, to which he <b>tipped</b> <b>his</b> cap. Good relations were seen during the All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Yankee manager Joe Torre, manager for the American League team, replaced starting shortstop Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox with Derek Jeter. Garciaparra received a standing ovation from the fans after Jeter came in to replace him (they also embraced each other at this time). Later in the game, {{when he came to}} bat, Jeter gave Garciaparra a tribute by mimicking his batting stance. Nine years later, in a similar fashion, Red Sox manager Terry Francona managed the American League team at the All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium, in the stadium's final season.|$|E
25|$|Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I <b>tipped</b> <b>his</b> bat {{several times}} when he had two strikes on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out. He got even, though. One time there were two strikes on him and he swung as the pitch was coming in. But he didn't swing at the ball. He swung right at my wrists. Sometimes I think I can still feel the pain. I'll tell you I didn't tip his bat again. No, sir, not until the last {{game of the season}} and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I <b>tipped</b> <b>his</b> bat again and got away with it.|$|E

25|$|The bull, serpent, tiger, ivy, {{and wine}} are {{characteristic}} of Dionysian iconography. Dionysus is also strongly associated with satyrs, centaurs, and sileni. He is often shown riding a leopard, wearing a leopard skin, or in a chariot drawn by panthers, and may also be recognized by the thyrsus he carries. Besides the grapevine and its wild barren alter-ego, the toxic ivy plant, both sacred to him, the fig was also his symbol. The pinecone that <b>tipped</b> <b>his</b> thyrsus linked him to Cybele.|$|E
25|$|After the Tigers had {{clinched}} the 1968 American League pennant, McLain {{added to his}} penchant for notoriety while pitching his 31st and final regular season victory {{in a game against}} the Yankees on September 19. McLain had grown up idolizing New York Yankee center fielder Mickey Mantle, who entered the game tied with Jimmie Foxx for third place in the major-league career home runs list. When Mantle—who was nine days away from his last major league appearance—came to bat in the eighth inning with the Tigers holding a 6-1 lead, McLain intentionally threw a soft pitch directly over home plate. Other accounts said that he called catcher Jim Price to the mound and had him tell Mantle that he would be throwing only fastballs. Mantle hit the pitch for his 535th career home run, putting him in sole possession of third place on the all-time home run list, behind only Babe Ruth and Willie Mays. As Mantle ran around the bases, McLain stood on the pitcher's mound and applauded. Mantle <b>tipped</b> <b>his</b> hat to McLain as he rounded the bases. The next batter, Joe Pepitone, waved his bat over the plate, as if asking for an easy pitch of his own. McLain responded by throwing the next pitch over Pepitone's head. After the game, McLain smilingly denied that he had served up an easy pitch for Mantle to hit; however, he was later reprimanded by Major League Baseball Commissioner William Eckert.|$|E
500|$|Alvin Snyder, the {{director}} of worldwide television for the United States Information Agency, was the producer of the video shown to the U.N. Security Council on September 6, 1983. In an article in The Washington Post on September 1, 1996, he stated {{that he had been}} given only limited access to the transcripts of the Soviet communication when he produced the video in 1983. When he received full insight into the Soviet transmissions in 1993, he says he realised that: [...] "The Russians (sic) believed the plane to be an RC-135 reconnaissance plane" [...] and that [...] "Osipovich (the Soviet fighter pilot) could not identify the plane" [...] and [...] "That he fired warning cannon shots and <b>tipped</b> <b>his</b> wings, an international signal to force the plane to land". Some of these statements were contradicted by the pilot in an interview with The New York Times, in which he confirmed that he did fire warning shots, but that they would not have been visible as they were not tracers.|$|E

500|$|When the {{two teams}} played {{for the first time}} at Yankee Stadium, on April 3, Yankee fans started new taunts, saying [...] "The Curse of 1918 is finally over (86 years). Let the new curse 2090 begin." [...] They also {{projected}} the next Red Sox championship with signs saying [...] "1918-2004-2090." [...] Just a week later, the Red Sox received their World Series rings at Fenway Park before they played the Yankees. All of the Yankees went to the top step of the dugout to applaud the Red Sox accomplishment. During the announcement of the lineups, Red Sox fans reciprocated by giving Yankee closer Mariano Rivera (who had struggled against the Red Sox) a loud, standing ovation, despite their booing of Alex Rodriguez. Rivera laughed and <b>tipped</b> <b>his</b> cap. In New York, the YES Network, the Yankees television network, declined to broadcast it. Instead, a fixed camera shot was focused tightly on correspondent Kimberly Jones as she described in general terms the events surrounding her; afterwards, YES was roundly criticized for the move. The Red Sox won the game 8–1.|$|E
500|$|Baseball people revere Hoffman for how {{he treats}} people. [...] Ausmus says Hoffman {{goes out of}} his way to engage fans. [...] Beyond shaking hands or signing autographs, he has {{extended}} conversations with fans who want to talk baseball. When Hoffman passed on the Indians in free agency to stay with the Padres, he still sent an autographed jersey as a baby gift to then-Indians manager Eric Wedge. After Hoffman saved the game to clinch the NL West on the last day of the 1996 season, he called Randy Smith, who traded for Hoffman as Padre GM before moving on to the Detroit Tigers. [...] "Randy, I wish you were here", Hoffman said. [...] "You're a part of this." [...] While celebrating his record setting 479th save against the Pirates, Hoffman <b>tipped</b> <b>his</b> cap to the Pittsburgh dugout, particularly Pirates manager Jim Tracy, who managed Hoffman in Cincinnati's Double-A Chattanooga farm team in 1991 after he was converted to a pitcher. Despite losing his role as a closer in his final season, Hoffman took pleasure in supporting his teammates and [...] "not being a cancer just because I was having trouble." ...|$|E

She responded, saying there was nothing to apologise for, and she even invited him to visit her home to see her new paintings, but at a time when she would be away.|$|E

2500|$|September 19: Denny McLain won his 31st {{game against}} the Yankees. In the 8th inning, with the Tigers safely in the lead, McLain called catcher Jim Price to the mound {{and told him to}} inform Mickey Mantle that he's {{throwing}} nothing but fastballs. McLain tossed up a fat one, and Mantle hit a home run to move into 3rd place on the all-time home run list. Mantle, who was planning to retire {{at the end of the}} season, <b>tipped</b> <b>his</b> cap to McLain as he rounded third base. Joe Pepitone‚ the next batter‚ signaled where he would like the ball‚ and McLain [...] "dusted" [...] him.

2500|$|New York Times reporters Neil Lewis and David Stout {{estimated}} subsequently that Libby's {{prison sentence}} could begin within [...] "two months", explaining that Judge Walton’s decision {{means that the}} defense lawyers will probably ask {{a federal appeals court}} to block the sentence, a long-shot move. It also sharpens interest in a question being asked by Mr. Libby’s supporters and critics alike: Will President Bush pardon Mr. Libby? ... So far, the president has expressed sympathy for Mr. Libby and his family but has not <b>tipped</b> <b>his</b> hand on the pardon issue. ... If the president does not pardon him, and if an appeals court refuses to second-guess Judge Walton’s decision, Mr. Libby will probably be ordered to report to prison in six to eight weeks' time. Federal prison authorities will decide where. [...] "Unless the Court of Appeals overturns my ruling, he will have to report", Judge Walton said.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} having been robbed and kidnapped, Mr. Ivy E. Russell {{continued}} to operate the Bank of Avilla for at least twelve more years. [...] A great crime wave of robberies and violence swept across the Midwest in 1932. [...] Following the Avilla caper, Mr. Russell increased security measures by keeping a large caliber firearm behind the teller window, and additional measures that remain a secret to this day. [...] It is known that Bonnie & Clyde of the infamous [...] "Barrow Gang" [...] were near the area in Joplin, Missouri mere months after the Bank of Avilla robbery by the O'Malley Gang. [...] The Barrow Gang were undoubtedly [...] "casing-out" [...] banks to rob as well. [...] Local lore has it that Clyde Barrow entered the Bank of Avilla, looked Mr. Russell in the eye, and then saw his [...]45 holstered while he stood behind the teller window.

[...] Though this is local legend, {{it is safe to}} assume that many other Depression-era hoodlums passed though town as well. The bank always remained open during normal hours, with Ivy E.

2500|$|On May 30, 2014, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that the FBI and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were investigating Mickelson and associates of his for insider trading in Clorox stock. Mickelson denied any wrongdoing, and the investigation found [...] "no evidence" [...] and concluded without any charges. [...] On May 19, 2016, Mickelson was named as a relief defendant in another SEC complaint alleging insider trading but completely avoided criminal charges in a parallel case brought in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York. The action stems for trades in Dean Foods in 2012 in conjunction with confidential information provided by Thomas Davis, {{a former director of}} Dean Foods Company, who <b>tipped</b> <b>his</b> friend and [...] "professional sports bettor" [...] Billy Walters. The SEC did not allege that Walters actually told Mickelson of any material, nonpublic information about Dean Foods, and the SEC disgorged Mickelson of the $931,000 profit he had made from trading Dean Foods stock and had him pay prejudgment interest of $105,000. In 2017, Walters was convicted of making $40 million on Davis's private information from 2008 to 2014 by a federal jury. At that time, it was also noted that Mickelson had [...] "once owed nearly $2 million in gambling debts to" [...] Walters. Walters' lawyer said Walters would appeal the 2017 verdict.|$|E
