5|$|Ros and Connie {{find the}} locker with the bomber's name and location, Grosvenor Square. An FSB sniper kills Crane, and at Connie's request, the bomb is sent <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{is the only}} person with the {{expertise}} to disarm it. Connie defuses the bomb, but by doing so a secondary countdown is initiated. She removes the nuclear material, but the bomb will still detonate. In her last words, Connie admits that she set up Lucas in Moscow eight years ago, which resulted in his imprisonment. Lucas and Ros then run to safety as the bomb detonates, killing Connie. With disaster averted, Lucas calls Harry, but receives no answer. In the end, it is revealed Sarkisiian has him locked up in the boot of his car.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the battle}} of Char, in , Raynor and Kerrigan are taken to a secret lab by Valerian to {{evaluate}} the extension of Kerrigan's current power to control the Zergs, until it is attacked by Dominion forces. Raynor is captured by Nova and Mengsk declares that he was executed, much to Kerrigan's grief. However, Mengsk later contacts Kerrigan and reveals that Raynor is still alive and under his custody, using him as a leverage to have her keep the Zerg swarm, now reunited under her command, away from Dominion Territory. Kerrigan then manages to rescue Raynor with the Raiders' help and despite his rejection of Kerrigan at first for choosing to abandon her humanity {{in order to save}} him, he and his forces join the swarm for a final battle on Korhal to overthrow Mengsk, saving Kerrigan once more when the Emperor tries to destroy her with the artifact, ultimately leading to Mengsk's death at her hands. Reconciled with Kerrigan, Raynor bids farewell <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> leaves with the Zerg swarm to confront Amon, the fallen Xel'Naga which intends to return and exterminate both the Zerg and Protoss races.|$|E

500|$|Melua {{opened up}} about the {{breakdown}} years later {{in an interview with}} The Independent, saying that it ended up being {{one of the best things}} that had ever happened <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> said it helped to squash a feeling of superiority she felt by being a successful musician in the music industry. [...] "....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about this job is the sense of superiority you get. It was a huge wake-up call. I was completely out of it for two weeks, and in hospital for six. There was a bunch of things going on, things at home and crazy work schedules, and you really believe the world revolved around you and it doesn’t." ...|$|E
500|$|Wright {{intended}} for the film to be [...] "as subjective as possible" [...] in being from Elizabeth's perspective; the audience first glimpses Darcy when she does. This focus on Elizabeth features some dramatic changes from the novel. Knightley's Elizabeth has an [...] "increasingly aloof and emotionally distant" [...] relationship with her family. Evidence {{of this can be}} seen with Elizabeth's gradual alienation from Jane as the film progresses; this is in contrast to the book, where Elizabeth confides more of her feelings to Jane after difficult events. Wright wanted to create a [...] "real" [...] relationship between the two sisters and have them grow apart, as he thought the book depicted them as too [...] "syrupy." [...] Moggach's intent was for Elizabeth to [...] "keep secrets to herself. They are a great burden <b>to</b> <b>her...</b> <b>As</b> <b>she</b> keeps all this to herself, we feel for her more and more. The truest comedy, I believe, is born from pain." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing {{began in}} late 2009, when the American singer Holly Hafermann resided at the Artula Retreat in Bandon, Oregon, and {{composed}} songs. Later, in New York City, under her new stage name Skylar Grey, she visited her Universal Music publisher, Jennifer Blakeman, {{to seek help}} presenting her work; Blakeman suggested she collaborate with Alex da Kid. The producer emailed Grey his track, which suggested a theme of abusive romantic relationships <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> spontaneously sang lyrics to the melody. She told the Los Angeles Times {{that she was in}} an abusive relationship with the music industry: [...] "I love it so much, and I give it all that I have, yet it beats me down." [...] This idea inspired her writing, a process she found came naturally, as if she were creating an alternative pop song for herself. She wrote the chorus to [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] in fifteenminutes and recorded vocals for Alex da Kid's demo.|$|E

500|$|Evan {{decides to}} build the ark alone, gaining media {{attention}} and public ridicule as hundreds of animals assemble in pairs. Meanwhile, God appears to Joan as a waiter at a diner, where he listens <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> expresses concern that Evan is losing his sanity and allowing himself to become a laughing stock, though claiming that [...] "God told him to do it." [...] Sympathetic toward Evan, God tells Joan that perhaps it is only opportunity for them, and explains {{that he does not}} give things but only the opportunity by which to obtain things, citing togetherness of families as one of these things. Seeing God's meaning, Joan finally returns to Evan with new-found faith and continues helping him finish the ark together in order to prepare for the flood. On September 22, the day of the flood, Evan's staffers arrive in support as well and Eugene shows him research he performed on Long. It is revealed that, many years ago, Long conquered Prestige Crest and later commissioned a dam, then destroyed the remaining land to have many of the lots and houses built. Long cut corners in building the dam, and will most likely {{do the same thing with}} his Public Land Act bill.|$|E
500|$|Ashman {{first met}} American actress and singer Jodi Benson {{while he was}} {{directing}} her in Smile. After the production closed prematurely, Ashman invited Smiles entire female cast to audition for The Little Mermaid using [...] "Part of Your World", {{although he did not}} tell them the name of the project they were auditioning for. Ashman mailed a copy of his demo of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] to Benson, to which she listened in preparation for her audition. Benson then recorded a brief sample of the song on a reel-to-reel tape, which she mailed to Disney. All audition tapes were left unidentified so that the candidates would remain anonymous to Musker and Clements, delighting Ashman when the directors ultimately selected Benson's tape to be the voice of Ariel. Her first voice acting role, for which she had to be carefully trained on properly projecting into the studio microphone, Benson found the process of recording [...] "Part of Your World" [...] somewhat difficult after Ashman instructed her to approach it as though she was reciting a monologue as opposed to singing a song, although she found Ashman telling her exactly how he wanted her to perform its lyrics helpful with benefiting her entire performance. Ashman remained in the recording booth with Benson during the entire recording process, advising her on performing the song with intensity as opposed to belting it and whispering lines <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sang them. It was rare for a filmmaker to direct a performer from within the booth, requiring Ashman to move carefully to prevent his gestures from being recorded by the microphone. Initially struggling to capture Ariel's [...] "tomboyish-ness and yearning", Benson requested that the studio's lights be dimmed to simulate the feeling of being underwater. Menken and Ashman deliberately selected segments from Benson's recording session that [...] "are not perfectly sung" [...] to include in the final version, ranging from unsustained, incorrect notes lacking in vibrato to spoken words, because the songwriters wanted her performance to sound as [...] "real" [...] as possible.|$|E
2500|$|When she was three, {{her family}} moved to Eatonville, Florida; in 1887 {{it was one of}} the first all-black towns to be {{incorporated}} into the United States. Hurston said she always felt that Eatonville was [...] "home" [...] <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> grew up there, and sometimes claimed it as her birthplace. Her father later was elected as mayor of the town in 1897 and in 1902 became preacher of its largest church, Macedonia Missionary Baptist.|$|E

But as it fell in its own rich music on her ears, its original import flashed vividly upon her mind. Her heart [...] "filled" [...] at the contrast which her circumstances represented, and she said, [...] "Address me not as Naomi, call not to me (לֵי) Naomi: address me as Mara," [...] - that is, [...] "bitter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael {{is aware}} that all his {{attempts}} to visualize what Hanna might have been like back then, what happened, are colored by what he has read and seen in movies. He feels a difficult identification with the victims when he learns that Hanna often picked one prisoner to read <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> chose him later on, only to send that girl to Auschwitz and the gas chamber after several months. Did she do it to make {{the last months of}} the condemned more bearable? Or to keep her secret safe? Michael's inability to both condemn and understand springs from this. He asks himself and the reader: ...|$|E
2500|$|Davison was {{actively}} involved in philanthropy and the betterment of ill-treated children and animals. Especially devoted {{to the welfare of}} dogs and horses from her youth, she was considered [...] "one of the finest horsewoman in the Islands" [...] and helped to arrange pāʻū riders in floral parades. She became involved with the Hawaii Humane Society and received a police commission and appointment in 1907 (or 1909) as humane officer by Sheriff Curtis P. Iaukea. Her duties included inspecting the barns and stables of the island to ensure compliance with the humane society. She also worked to protect children, especially young girls, taking them from abusive families and placing them in foster care or into industrial schools. She would personally go to the lowly parts of town at night to save the children in these areas. It was noted, [...] "Hardly a school child in the country, whether white or brown but knew Miss Davison and the boys always took off their hats <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> passed them." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{a desolate}} pier, the Phantom, Christine, and Madame Giry find the distraught Meg {{seemingly}} about to drown Gustave {{in the ocean}} ("Please Miss Giry, I Want to Go Back!..."). Meg brandishes a gun to make the Phantom finally pay attention <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> describes the lengths the Girys have gone to {{over the years to}} ensure the success of Phantasma, including Meg's offering herself to men in high places to [...] "grease the wheels of [...] high-flying deals". The Phantom apologizes for his failure to truly see Meg and her contributions, but when he unthinkingly mentions Christine, Meg becomes enraged and accidentally fires the gun, shooting Christine. The Phantom rushes to Christine and orders Madame Giry to go for help while Meg looks on in stunned horror at what she has done. Knowing that she hasn't much time, Christine reveals to Gustave that the Phantom is his real father and she tells the Phantom that her love for him will never die. The two share a final kiss and she dies in his arms. The Phantom has Meg hold Christine's body as he moves to comfort Gustave, who unmasks him without fear as the curtain falls.|$|E
2500|$|Jeffrey Lockhart’s father, Ross, is a George Soros-like billionaire {{now in his}} sixties, with {{a younger}} wife, Artis, whose health is failing. Ross is the primary {{investor}} in a deeply remote and secret compound where death is controlled and bodies are preserved until a future moment when medicine and technology can reawaken them. Jeffrey joins Ross and Artis at the compound to say [...] "an uncertain farewell" [...] <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> surrenders her body. Ross Lockhart is not driven by the hope for immortality, for power and wealth beyond the grave. He is driven by love for his wife, for Artis, without whom he feels life is not worth living. It is that which compels him to submit to death long before his time. Jeffrey heartily disapproves. He is committed to living, to [...] "the mingled astonishments of our time, here, on earth. [...] "Thus begins an emotionally resonant novel that weighs {{the darkness of the}} world—terrorism, floods, fires, famine, death—against the beauty of everyday life; love, awe, [...] "the intimate touch of earth and sun." [...] Brilliantly observed and infused with humor, Don Delillo’s Zero K is an acute observation about the fragility and meaning of life, about embracing our family, this world, our language, and our humanity.|$|E
