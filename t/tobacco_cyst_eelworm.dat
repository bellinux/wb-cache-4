5000|$|Heterodera schachtii [...] (Beet <b>cyst</b> <b>eelworm,</b> Sugarbeet nematode) is a plant {{pathogenic}} nematode. It infects {{more than}} 200 different plants including economically important {{crops such as}} sugar beets, cabbage, broccoli, and radish. H. schachtii is found worldwide. Affected plants are marked by stunted growth, wilting, yellowing, decreased yields, and death. While there are many methods of control, crop rotation with non-susceptible plants is preferred.|$|R
2500|$|Patellifolia {{is related}} to the {{economically}} important cultivated beets (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris, with sugar beet, beetroot, chard and fodder beet). Therefore, Patellifolia is of great interest as Crop wild relative and potential gene donor. They seem to be resistant {{to some of the most}} serious diseases of sugar beets, to leaf spot disease caused by Cercospora beticola, curly top virus, rhizomania, and powdery mildew (Erysiphe polygoni). All three species proved to be highly resistant to the Beet <b>cyst</b> <b>eelworm</b> (Heterodera schachtii). The three species differ in their resistance level, whereas Patellifolia patellaris is not completely immune, but eelworms never develop to maturity in the other two species.|$|R

40|$|Tobacco, eastern black nightshade, {{and tomato}} were grown for 3 to 13 weeks to assess {{differences}} in invasion, development, and soil density of Globodera tabacum tabacum (<b>tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode) in field plots and microplots over three seasons. <b>Tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> nematodes invaded roots of resistant and susceptible tobacco, nightshade, and tomato. Nematode development was fastest in nightshade and slowest in tomato, and few adults developed in roots of nematode-resistant tobacco. Soil populations of <b>tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> nematodes were reduced up to 80 % by destroying nightshade or susceptible tobacco grown for 3 to 6 weeks. Nematode populations were reduced up to 96 % by destroying tomato or resistant tobacco grown for 3 to 6 weeks. Timing of crop destruction was less critical with tomato and resistant tobacco, as nematode populations {{did not increase}} after 13 weeks of growth. These studies demonstrate that trap cropping, through crop destruction, can significantly reduce G. t. tabacum populations...|$|R
50|$|The <b>tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> {{nematode}} is a sedentary semi-endoparasite of the roots. Its feeding {{site and}} feeding patterns {{are typical of}} the genus Globodera. Nurse cell is a multinucleate syncytium.Tobacco cyst nematode causes significant damage on tobacco root system mainly by intracellular migration. This damage is caused both by mechanical penetration {{as well as with}} the enzyme secretions. Syncytium is formed in pericycle and endodermal cells of the plant. Unlike root-knot nematodes, the <b>tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode does not form feeding tubes enveloped in an endoplasmatic reticulum. Due to lack of enzymes that cause hypetrophy and hyperplasia, there is no galling observed.|$|R
5000|$|Ramsay {{was widely}} {{known for his}} {{research}} on a potato <b>cyst</b> <b>eelworm</b> [...] - [...] the parasitic golden nematode (Globodera rostochiensis). The worm was discovered in 1941 in potato fields on Long Island, New York, the only state where it has established a foothold. Around 1946, the worm was found on a {{lily of the valley}} plants imported from the Netherlands. Ramsay helped trace the worm to infested flower fields in Germany that had been converted for potato cultivation during World War II. Inspectors from the Department of Agriculture began testing cargoes of lilies in Hamburg, which initially slowed the golden nematode's spread from across the Atlantic. The Golden Nematode Act was enacted on June 15, 1948, to combat the worm. http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps3025/history.html As of 2003, the golden nematode is one of 22 federally regulated organisms in the United States. http://plpnemweb.ucdavis.edu/nemaplex/Mangmnt/Exclusion.htm According to Society of Nematologists, [...] "he played an instrumental role in reducing the spread of Globodera rostochiensis in the United States."

5000|$|The <b>tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode, Globodera tabacum, is {{a serious}} and {{important}} soil borne parasite of the shade [...] and broadleaf [...] tobacco. The most important host plant for this nematode is tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L), but other hosts include tomato, eggplant and closely related solanaceous weeds. This species of nematodes was first discovered in Hazardville, Connecticut in the 1950s. Nematode infection of the tobacco root system causes dramatic stunting, yield loss and decreases leaf quality.|$|R

40|$|Prompt tillage after crop harvest was {{investigated}} {{as a cultural}} control for the <b>tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode, Globodera tabacum tabacum, on stalk-cut broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco. Stalk stumps and roots remaining after harvest were destroyed by tilling immediately or from 2 to 6 wk after harvest in field experiments over 4 yr. Cyst nematode Pf/Pi ratios ranged from 0. 65 to 1. 62 when plants were tilled immediately after harvest and 1. 13 to 5. 88 when tillage was delayed. Nematode population development was monitored by inoculating plants in pots placed in fields with J 2 in eggs and sampling over time (8 to 18 wk). Three generations per year were observed, and G. t. tabacum generation time was as short as 6 wk for each generation. Destroying stalks and root systems remaining after harvesting stalk-cut broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco removes the host to preclude development of nematodes {{at the end of}} the second and entire third generation. Early tillage resulted in consistently lower <b>tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode populations than allowing viable roots to remain in fields for an additional 8 to 18 wk. This management tactic reduces the need for nematicide application to slow nematode population increases over time and can reduce losses due to infection by G. t. tabacum...|$|R
40|$|The potato {{breeding}} programme at Oak Park {{was started in}} the 1960 's and has consisted {{of a number of}} distinct phases. In the first phase the focus was on the testing of the main domestic and foreign varieties in field trials in the main potato growing areas of the country. This was followed by a {{breeding programme}} for the domestic market, with particular emphasis on the production of a blight resistant replacement for Kerr’s Pink. The emphasis then switched to breeding for the export market, with the focus on the UK and Mediterranean markets. Since then the breeding programme has been focused on the domestic, processing and export markets. The process of breeding, testing and multiplying a new potato variety from the making of the initial cross until the new variety can be commercially grown takes about 15 years (see Appendix 2). The objectives of the present Potato Breeding Programme are: 1. Breeding improved varieties for the seed export trade. 2. Developing high yielding early maincrop and maincrop types with resistance to potato <b>cyst</b> <b>eelworm</b> Globodera rostochiensis and or Globodera pallidae with quality suitable for the UK market. 3. Developing a high dry-matter red skinned early maincrop or maincrop variety suitable for the home ware trade {{with a high level of}} disease resistance especially to late blight. 4. To select early maincrop or maincrop types suitable for processing into crisps and chips. 5.

40|$|The <b>tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> {{nematode}} (Globodera tabacum solanacearum) {{continues to}} pose {{a serious threat to}} flue-cured tobacco production in Virginia and nearby states. Soils were sampled from five uninfested and two infested flue-cured tobacco-producing locations. Twenty-three edaphic factors were characterized to determine if any were correlated with G. t. solanacearum reproduction. Comparisons were also made between pasteurized and natural soils to determine if biological suppression of G. t. solanacearum reproduction might be occurring in currently uninfested areas. Differences in G. t. solanacearum reproduction were noted among the soils, but results were inconsistent across the three trials conducted in this study. Only soil pH correlated significantly with nematode reproduction, and then only in one of three trials.

40|$|Penetration and {{development}} of juveniles of <b>tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode (Globodera tabacum solanacearum) on a resistant (NC 567) and a susceptible (K 326) cultivar of flue-cured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) were determined in root zone chamber experiments. More vermiform juveniles developed into a swollen shape at 22, 27, and 31 °C than at 17 °C. Development of flask-shaped nematodes appeared to be similar across tested temperatures (17, 22, 27, and 31 °C). General patterns of penetration {{and development}} of juveniles in both resistant and susceptible cultivars were similar under all temperatures tested. More vermiform, swollen, and flask-shaped nematodes were found in roots of K 326 than in those of NC 567. Development from swollen to flaskshaped nematodes appeared to be similar between the two cultivars, although more vermiform juveniles developed into swollen nematodes on K 326 than on NC 567. Differences in resistance between the two cultivars remained stable across tested temperatures...|$|R
40|$|In {{greenhouse}} experiments, broadleaf tobacco {{plants were}} inoculated with <b>tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> (Globodera tabacum tabacum) or root-knot (Meloidogyne hapla) nematodes 3, 2, or 1 week before {{or at the}} same time as Fusarium oxysporum. Plants infected with nematodes prior to fungal inoculation had greater Fusarium wilt incidence and severity than those simultaneously inoculated. G. t. tabacum increased wilt incidence and severity more than did M. hapla. Mechanical root wounding within 1 week of F. oxysporum inoculation increased wilt severity. In field experiments, early-season G. t. tabacum control by preplant soil application of oxamyl indirectly limited the incidence and severity of wilt. Wilt incidence was 48 %, 23 %, and 8 % in 1989 and 64 %, 60 %, and 19 % in 1990 for 0. 0, 2. 2, and 6. 7 kg oxamyl/ha, respectively.

40|$|A morphometric {{evaluation}} of second-stage juveniles (J 2), males, females, cysts, and eggs of several isolates of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode (TCN) complex, Globodera tabacum tabacum (GTT), G. t. virginiae (GTV), and G. t. solanacearum (GTS) is presented. Morphometrics of eggs, J 2, and males are considerably less variable than of females and cysts. No measurements of eggs and J 2 {{are useful for}} identification of the three subspecies. Distance from the median bulb and excretory pore to the head end in J 2 and males is quite stable. Stylet knob width of males is useful for identifying GTV isolates and tail length in separating males of GTT isolates from GTV and GTS. Body length/width (L/W) ratio of females and cysts discriminates GTT from GTV and GTS; stylet knob width is an auxiliary character for identifying GTV. This subspecies complex has a continuum of values for the other characters. Data suggest a close relationship between GTV and GTS, which also occur in close proximity in Virginia...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> {{nematode}} (Globodera tabacum solanacearum) isolates {{were collected}} from 11 locations in Virginia, 3 in North Carolina, and 1 in Maryland. Isolates from each location were maintained and increased on flue-cured tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum cv K 326. Plants of flue-cured tobacco cultivars K 326 (susceptible) and NC 567 (resistant) were each inoculated with 6, 000 G. t. solanacearum eggs/plant. Tests were conducted over one (6 weeks) or two (14 weeks) generations of the nematode. Shoot and root weights {{and the number of}} nematodes present within a 1 -g subsample of feeder roots were recorded at completion of the tests. Nematode counts were categorized by nematode life stage (vermiform, swollen, pyriform, and adult). Although significant differences in nematode development were detected among isolates, differences were not consistent across experiments. Results indicate similar virulence among G. t. solanacearum isolates on resistant and susceptible flue-cured tobacco cultivars. Therefore, plant breeders may effectively use a single G. t. solanacearum isolate when screening tobacco germplasm for resistance...|$|R
40|$|Two soil {{extraction}} {{methods were}} compared to determine their efficiency in recovering cysts and juveniles of a <b>tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode, Globodera tabacum solanacearum. The methods were equally efficient when extracting nematodes from soil samples seeded in the laboratory; however, {{there was a significant}} extraction method × month interaction when the methods were used to estimate field soil populations over 2 years. The centrifugal sugar flotation method recovered greater numbers of cysts when densities were near 400 cysts/ 100 cm³ soil and greater numbers of juveniles in all samples. The sugar flotation method recovered greater numbers of cysts during months when densities were less than 400 cysts/ 100 cm³ soil. Numbers of cysts and juveniles were lowest in June and July following land tillage in May. A soil freeze in January 1982 may have been responsible for unusually high numbers of recovered cysts in February and March 1982, a pattern that did not occur in 1983...|$|R
40|$|When {{sedentary}} endoparasitic nematodes infect plants, they induce complex feeding sites {{within the}} root tissues of their host. To characterize cell wall changes induced within these structures at a molecular level, we studied {{the expression of}} an extensin gene (coding for a major structural cell wall protein) in nematode-infected tobacco roots. Extensin gene expression was observed to be induced very early upon infection. This induction was weak, transient, and probably due to wounding during penetration and migration of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode Globodera tabacum ssp solanacea-rum. In contrast, high extensin gene expression was observed during the whole second larval stage (an ~ 2 -week-long phase of establishment of the feeding site) of the root knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica. During later stages of this interaction, expression gradually decreased. Extensin gene expression was found {{in at least three}} different tissues of the gall. We propose that distinct mechanisms lead to induced expression in these different cell types. The significance of these results for the understanding of plant-nematode interactions as well as the function of structural cell wall proteins, such as extensin, is discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{dispersal}} {{abilities and}} the population genetic structure of nematodes living in soils are poorly known. In the present study, we have pursued these issues in the <b>tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode, Globodera tabacum, which is responsible of significant yield reductions. Nine microsatellites markers were used to explore the dispersal and genetic structure of 18 French G. tabacum populations. All the populations sampled belong to the "tabacum" subspecies and low level of gene flow was observed among G. tabacum populations in France. Bayesian genetic assignments revealed two distinct genetic groups that matched with the geographic limits of two agricultural cooperative societies. An {{important part of the}} genetic variability was observed between these agricultural cooperative societies and also within populations. Those results highlight the impact of the human organization of agricultural practices on the genetic structure of G. tabacum populations and complement previous results obtained on other cyst nematodes, showing the major contribution of human activities and soil transports during harvest in the passive dispersion of these organisms.

The TCN-resistant cultivars reduced TCN population densities compared with continuous {{planting of}} K 326. Initial TCN egg densities in soil tended to be lower and yields of K 326 without fenamiphos were consistently higher when a resistant cultivar had been planted the previous year. Planting NC 567 in 1987 - 88 reduced initial 1989 TCN densities to below 1, 000 eggs/ 500 cm³ soil. Use of NC 567 in 1987 - 88 also increased 1989 yields and net economic returns for K 326 above those of untreated plots continuously planted with K 326. Yields and net economic returns were similar from cultivar rotation strategies involving Speight G- 80 or NC 567.

40|$|Two beta- 1, 4 -endoglucanase (EGase) cDNAs were {{isolated}} from Globodera tabacum, the <b>tobacco</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode, {{and have been}} designated as GT-eng- 1 and GT-eng- 2. GT-eng- 1 and GT-eng- 2 encode precursor proteins with a predicted secretion signal sequence, cellulolytic catalytic domain, and a linker domain. The protein product GT-ENG- 1 contains an additional 95 amino acid carboxy terminal sequence with strong similarity to type II cellulose binding domains. Riboprobes and polyclonal antibodies raised to recombinant cyst nematode EGases were used to follow expression patterns of EGase transcripts and proteins throughout the nematode life cycle. EGase transcripts and proteins were specifically detected within the subventral esophageal gland cells of G. tabacum second-stage juveniles (J 2) within eggs prior to hatching, in preparasitic J 2, and in parasitic J 2 that had invaded tobacco roots. EGase transcripts and proteins were not detected in G. tabacum after the molt to the sedentary J 3, J 4, and adult female life stages.

40|$|The {{identity}} of a newly discovered population of pale potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida associated with potato in eastern Idaho was established by morphological and molecular methods. Morphometrics of cysts and second-stage juveniles were generally within the expected ranges for G. pallida with some variations noted. The Idaho population and paratype material from Epworth, Lincolnshire, England, both showed variations in tail shape, with bluntly rounded to finely pointed tail termini. Compared to literature values for the paratypes, second-stage juveniles of the Idaho population had a somewhat shorter mean body length, and cysts had a slightly higher mean distance from the anus to the nearest edge of the fenestra. PCR-RFLP of the rDNA ITS region, sequence-specific multiplex PCR and DNA sequence comparisons all confirmed the {{identity of}} the Idaho population as G. pallida. The ITS rDNA sequence of the Idaho isolate was identical to those from York, England, and the Netherlands.

Root exudates {{were collected}} by soaking seedlings in deionized water for 2 hours at 22 °C in the dark. Fifteen mature and uniformly sized cysts were exposed at 15, 20, or 25 °C to undiluted root exudate, root exudate diluted 1 : 1 or 1 : 3 with deionized water, or deionized water alone. Hatched juveniles were counted and removed at weekly intervals during 42 and 53 days of exposure in experiments conducted in 1994 and 1995, respectively. Root exudates from both susceptible cultivar K 326 and resistant cultivar NC 567 stimulated more hatching than deionized water at 25 °C in 1994, and at all three tested temperatures in 1995. In 1994, dilution of root exudates 1 : 3 reduced stimulation of hatching at 25 °C compared to undiluted exudate. Hatching at 25 °C was similarly stimulated by exposure to undiluted root exudate and exudate diluted 1 : 1.

The PGPR included combinations of Bacillus subtilis A 13 with B. pumilis INR 7, B. pumilis SE 34, B. licheniformis IN 937 b, or B. amyloliquefaciens IN 937 a, respectively. Among the four rhizobacterial combinations, IN 937 a + A 13 exhibited the most consistent reduction in G. t. solanacearum cysts under greenhouse and field conditions. No undesirable effects of IN 937 a + A 13 were observed on tobacco growth under greenhouse and field conditions. Use of INR 7 + A 13 reduced G. t. solanacearum reproduction on flue-cured tobacco cv. K 326 but not on oriental tobacco cv. Xanthi. Application of ASM reduced final numbers of G. t. solanacearum cysts, but also resulted in phytotoxicity mainly under the greenhouse conditions.

Infection by G. t. solanacearum suppressed number of leaves, plant height, and fresh weight of leaves and feeder roots. Correlations between weekly egg densities of G. t. solanacearum collected from soil and host growth during 11 weeks after transplanting (WAT) were often inconsistent between cultivars and years. However, consistent correlations were obtained between root weight and egg densities collected 9 WAT, as well as between leaf weight from susceptible K 326 and nematode egg densities 6 WAT. Leaf and feeder root weights were significantly correlated with the area under the curve for all nematodes per gram of feeder root for K 326 in 1993 and for both cultivars in 1994. Reduction in feeder root weight by G. t. solanacearum was similar for the resistant and susceptible cultivars. Reduction in fresh leaf weight by G. t. solanacearum was twice as great (P ≤ 0. 07) for K 326 as for NC 567 in 1994.

Two sets of two independent experiments were conducted, each involving soil or root sampling. Soil sample experiments included flue-cured tobacco cultivars with (Php+: NC 71 and NC 102) and without (Php-: K 326 and K 346) a gene (Php) suppressing TCN parasitism. Root sample experiments examined TCN root parasitism of NC 71 and K 326. Cultivars possessing the Php gene (Php+) were compared with Php- cultivars to assess the effects of resistance mediated via Php gene vs. induced resistance to TCN. GB 99 +GB 122 consistently reduced nematode reproductive ratio on both Php+ and Php- cultivars, but similar effects of ASM across Php- cultivars were less consistent. In addition, ASM application resulted in leaf yellowing and reduced root weight. GB 99 +GB 122 consistently reduced nematode development in roots of both Php+ and Php- cultivars, while similar effects of ASM were frequently less consistent. The {{results of this study}} indicate that GB 99 +GB 122 consistently reduced TCN reproduction in all flue-cured tobacco cultivars tested, while the effects of ASM were only consistent in Php+ cultivars.
