5|$|Some {{studies have}} found that deep frying in olive and {{sunflower}} oils {{has been found to be}} less of a detriment to health and in some cases have positive effects on insulin levels. Oil can be reused a few times after original use after straining out solids. However, excessive use of the same oil can cause it to break down and release compounds into <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> may be carcinogenic, affect liver health, or influence the body's ability to absorb vitamins. Some European countries have set public health standards for the safety of frying oil.|$|E
5|$|Sumptuary laws {{regulated}} <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> one consumed and {{the clothes}} that one wore according to status and social class. Clothing {{was made of}} hemp or cotton cloths, restricted to a colour standard of black and white. Trousers were the acceptable attire for peasants, soldiers, artisans, and merchants, although wealthy merchants might choose to wear more ornate clothing and male blouses that came down below the waist. Acceptable apparel for scholar-officials was rigidly defined by social ranking system. However, {{as time went on}} this rule of rank-graded apparel for officials was not as strictly enforced. Each official was able to display his awarded status by wearing different-coloured traditional silken robes that hung to the ground around his feet, specific types of headgear, and even specific styles of girdles that displayed his graded-rank of officialdom.|$|E

5|$|Khmer Loeu diets in Ratanakiri {{are largely}} {{dictated}} by <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> {{is available for}} harvesting or gathering. Numerous food taboos also limit food choice, particularly among pregnant women, children, and the sick. The primary staple grain is rice, though most families experience rice shortages during the six months before harvest time. Some families have begun to plant maize to alleviate this problem; other sources of grain include potatoes, cassava, and taro. Most Khmer Loeu diets are low in protein, which is limited in availability. Wild game and fish are major protein sources, and smaller animals such as rats, wild chickens, and insects are also sometimes eaten. Domestic animals such as pigs, cows, and buffaloes are only eaten when sacrifices are made. In the rainy season, many varieties of vegetables and leaves are gathered from the forest. (Vegetables are generally not cultivated.) Commonly eaten fruits include bananas, jackfruit, papayas, and mangoes.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of May 30, the 54th Battalion's 1st Company {{attacked}} the area around Isdud's railway station, but was outgunned and had to retreat with four wounded. According to the company's report, <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> was given to them was rotten and further deteriorated the soldiers' ability to fight. On May 31, the Egyptian radio described the attack as a victory, and claimed hundreds of dead Israelis. The 3rd Company was unsuccessful, as intelligence on precise Egyptian positions was sparse, while the company gave its position away quickly. An Egyptian mortar scored a direct hit {{on one of the}} company's squads, which caused casualties and panic. One of the soldiers ran for cover, but lost direction, and ended up in Isdud. He walked around the village unnoticed and found a chance to return to Givati, and provided the command with invaluable information for the operation.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are staring down at them. The boys have already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> is brought out to them and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|E

25|$|Provisioning {{troops and}} sailors {{proved to be}} an immense challenge, as the {{majority}} of food stores had to be shipped overseas from Britain. The need to maintain Loyalist support prevented the Army from living off the land. Other factors also impeded this option; the countryside was too sparsely populated and the inhabitants were largely hostile or indifferent, the network of roads and bridges was poorly developed, and the area which the British controlled was so limited that foraging parties were frequently in danger of being ambushed. After France entered the war, the threat of the French navy increased the difficulty of transporting supplies to America. <b>The</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> could be bought in America was purchased at vastly inflated prices. Soldiers stationed in the West Indies perhaps suffered the worst; the garrison commander of Tobago, Barbados, and Antigua frequently complained of the near-total lack of regular supply from Britain, and <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> could be bought was so expensive that the pay of the troops was inadequate to cover the costs.|$|E
