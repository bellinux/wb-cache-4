5|$|The Minority Treaties, {{recognized}} as history's first minority treaties, were {{an important step}} in protection of minorities and recognition of human rights, bringing the subject to an international forum. In them, for the first time, states and international communities recognized <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> living outside normal legal protection and who required an additional guarantee of their elementary rights from an external body, as protection within individual states itself may not be sufficient. Among issues successfully resolved by the Minority Treaties was the Åland crisis.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{locus of}} control, {{there is another}} type of control that entails a mix among the {{internal}} and external types. People that have the combination of the two types of locus of control are often referred to as Bi-locals. People that have Bi-local characteristics are known to handle stress and cope with their diseases more efficiently by having the mixture of internal and external locus of control. People that have this mix of loci of control can take personal responsibility for their actions and the consequences thereof while remaining capable of relying upon and having faith in outside resources; these characteristics correspond to {{the internal and external}} loci of control, respectively. An example of this mixed system would be an alcoholic who will accept the fact that he brought the disease upon himself while remaining open to treatment and/or acknowledging <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>people,</b> mainly doctors and therapists, that are trying to cure his/her addiction, and on whom he should rely.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the details}} the team added are post-war effects that {{continue}} on the battlefield throughout the game, where dust and smoke continue to roll through the streets, clouding up vision, and junk and debris scattered everywhere. The game has sound attenuation, with a 5.1 surround sound system, and context sensitive dialog, {{with a total of}} twenty-thousand lines of dialog. Each of the soldiers fighting alongside the player will call out the position of enemy soldiers, warn of flank attacks, and help out in ways that were not possible in {{the first game of the}} series. Zampella said, [...] "We really wanted realistic battle chatter going that's not only entertaining, but actually adds to the gaming experience.

500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that.

500|$|... "You Can't Win" [...] was {{originally}} written and performed during the pre-Broadway Baltimore {{run of the}} stage version of The Wiz in 1974, sung by the chorus of Winkies, the Wicked Witch's slaves. The number was cut from the musical before the official Broadway opening and wasn't performed again until the movie version was under consideration, 3 years later. [...] The producers resurrected the song as a solo for Michael Jackson to replace [...] "I Was Born on the Day Before Yesterday", which had been Scarecrow's solo in the Broadway musical. [...] "You Can't Win" [...] and its corresponding scene in the movie allude to mistreatment of African Americans. Jackson stated in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk that the lyrics to [...] "You Can't Win" [...] are about humiliation and helplessness, feelings, he stated, that many people have experienced {{at one point in}} their life. The singer added that the song was also about [...] "the feeling <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> out there who don't actively hold you back as much as they work quietly on your insecurities so that you hold yourself back". [...] "You Can't Win" [...] opens with the lines, [...] "You can't win, you can't break even, and you can't get out of the game. People keep sayin', things are gonna change, but they look just like they're staying the same." [...] William F. Brown, who wrote the book for the Broadway musical, stated that such verses made [...] "You Can't Win" [...] a [...] "black message song". Musically, the track has been described as an R, pop and soul song by Renée Graham of The Boston Globe. According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the track was performed in common time, with a tempo of 80beats per minute. It adds that the song is composed in E with a range from B3 to C5.|$|E

2500|$|Amos' {{brother died}} in a car crash in 2005 and it is widely {{believed}} that the song that closes the album, Our New Year, deals with her own thoughts and feelings behind his tragic demise. However, when asked, Amos chose to keep the meaning of the song private, [...] "I think {{at this time of year}} you think of people that might not be in your life anymore or who’ve left the planet. I get really nostalgic at Christmas, and memories of other times with other people who you might not have heard from in a long time can cross your mind." [...] Finally, when asked pointedly if she had anyone in mind when writing the song, Amos responded definitively, [...] "I did. But, we’ll leave it there." [...] "People get nostalgic and you have to acknowledge <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> that aren’t with you anymore, so there’s a song that does that.

2500|$|There {{was no real}} consensus, {{at least}} among {{surviving}} Roman texts and epitaphs, {{of what happened to}} a person after death or the existence of an afterlife.

Seneca the Younger seems to be less consistent, arguing both sides, indicating that death brings about utter annihilation while also talking about some survival of the spirit after it escapes from the prison of the body. Tacitus at the end of Agricola takes the opposite opinion to Pliny, and claims that the wise believe the spirit does not die with the body, although he may be specifically referring to the pious [...] – which harkens to the mythological idea of Elysium.

2500|$|As a [...] "wheeler-dealer", Mickey bonded {{particularly}} well with another dodgy dealer on the Square, Mo Harris (Laila Morse). Swash has commented, [...] "It's natural for Mickey and Mo {{to be close}} because they're so similar. They're into the same things and doing business." [...] Their interaction was mostly used for comedic purposes. In 2004, the duo were featured in a special plot to highlight the BBC's fundraising event, Sport Relief, which tackles poverty and disadvantage, both in the UK and internationally. On-screen, Mickey competed in the Fitness First Sport Relief Mile, to raise money via sponsoring. As part of the storyline, Mo encouraged Mickey to keep the sponsorship money for himself, though Mickey eventually did [...] "the right thing", donating the money to charity. Commenting on the storyline, Swash said, [...] "Mickey is always trying to make money through some scam or another.

We must not forget <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> who have wanted to present this work as something humiliating, but it is not. No doubt, the conditions under which this work used to be done were humiliating and sometimes they still are, even today, when domestic staff are subjected in their work to the whim of an arbitrary employer who does not guarantee their rights, and who gives them low wages and no affection... Any job that is well done is a wonderful service to society, and this is as true of domestic work as it is of the work of a professor or judge. The only work that is not a service is that of a person who works for his own self-interest...I understand that work in the home is especially important because through it so much good or harm can be done to families." ...|$|E
