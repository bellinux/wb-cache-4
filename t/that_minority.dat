5|$|The {{incident}} {{occurred at a}} time of unusually strained relations between the Muslim world and the West. This was a result of decades of Muslim immigration to Europe, recent political struggles, violent incidents such as September 11 and a string of Islamist terrorist attacks and Western interventions in Muslim countries. The cartoons were used as a tool by different political interests {{in a wide variety of}} local and international situations. Some debate surrounded the relationship between Islamic minorities and their broader societies, and the legal and moral limits that the press should observe when commenting on <b>that</b> <b>minority</b> or any religious minority group.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} GRC scheme is {{intended}} to ensure minority representation in Parliament, {{it can be said}} that the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem of minority candidates as they would not be sure if they are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and the merits of the rest of the team of MPs. This would result in minority candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority candidates believing <b>that</b> <b>minority</b> candidates have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as it assumes that they are not able to see the value or merit of minority candidates, and only vote for candidates with whom they share a common race, culture and language.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} members of the councils is defined by the councils themselves, based on {{applicable}} legislation. Electoral committees are then tasked with determining whether the national ethnic minorities are represented on the council as required by the constitution. Further members who belong to the minorities may be added to the council in no candidate of <b>that</b> <b>minority</b> has been elected through the proportional representation system. Election silence, as in all other types of elections in Croatia, when campaigning is forbidden, is enforced the day before the election and continues until 19:00 hours on the election day when the polling stations close and exit polls may be announced. Six nationwide local elections have been held in Croatia since 1990, the most recent being the 2009 local elections to elect county prefects and councils, and city and municipal councils and mayors. In 2009, the HDZ-led coalitions won a majority or plurality in fifteen county councils and thirteen county prefect elections. SDP-led coalitions won a majority or plurality in five county councils, including the city of Zagreb council, and the remaining county council election was won by IDS-SDP coalition. The SDP won four county prefect elections and the city of Zagreb mayoral election, the HSS won three county prefect elections, and the HNS and the HDSSB won a single county prefect election each.|$|E

In direct contrast to past research, minorities arguing against the death penalty Zeitgeist were more powerful sources of social influence than those arguing in favor of it. Analyses of conversation content and thought-listing data suggest <b>that</b> <b>minorities</b> arguing against the death penalty may have been more influential because they were appealing to a superordinate shared belief system within their respective groups...|$|R

25|$|John Lindsay {{was elected}} Mayor of New York City in 1965 {{as a liberal}} Republican {{pledging}} to take on special interests, including the building and construction unions.

A study by the New York City Commission on Human Rights in 1967 found <b>that</b> <b>minority</b> membership in the six most highly skilled building trades was only 2 percent and had not changed since 1960.

40|$|Older {{studies have}} found <b>that</b> <b>minorities</b> in the United States receive fewer mental health {{services}} than whites. This analysis compares rates of outpatient mental health treatment according to race and ethnicity using more recent, population-based data, from the 1997 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. The authors calculated visit rates per 1, 000 population to either primary care or psychiatric providers for mental health counseling, psychotherapy, and psychiatric drug therapy. In the primary care setting, Hispanics and blacks had lower visit rates (per 1, 000 population) for drug therapy than whites (48. 3 and 73. 7 vs. 109. 0; P <. 0001 and P <. 01, respectively). Blacks also had a lower visit rate for talk therapy (mental health counseling or psychotherapy) than whites (23. 6 vs. 42. 5; P <. 01). In the psychiatric setting, Hispanics and blacks had lower visit rates than whites for talk therapy (38. 4 and 33. 6 vs. 85. 1; P <. 0001 for both comparisons) and drug therapy (38. 3 and 29. 1 vs. 71. 8; P <. 0001 for both comparisons). These results indicate <b>that</b> <b>minorities</b> receive about half as much outpatient mental health care as whites. According to the Surgeon General, the U. S. mental health system “is not well equipped {{to meet the needs}} of racial and ethnic minority populations ” (1). Several older studies found that blacks and Hispanics receive less mental health care than whites (2 – 5). Recent studies of selected populations have shown <b>that</b> <b>minorities</b> continue to receive inadequate treatment for mental health problems (6, 7).

25|$|Hearts made a {{deal with}} the Scottish Rugby Union to use Murrayfield Stadium in order that they could sell Tynecastle. Originally this was meant to happen during the summer of 2004, but was then delayed for a season. During this period, Hearts were a public limited company. Ownership of the club was very fractured, with no {{individual}} shareholder owning more than 20% of the club. This meant <b>that</b> <b>minority</b> shareholders, including supporters' groups and the McGrail brothers, could realistically hope to acquire other minority stakes in order to block the proposals to sell Tynecastle.

25|$|In 2004, News Corporation {{retained}} {{the services of}} public relations firm Glover Park to launch a campaign aimed at delaying Nielsen's plan to replace its aging household electronic data collection methodology in larger local markets with its newer electronic People Meter system. The advocates in the public relations campaign charged that data derived from the newer People Meter system represented a bias toward underreporting minority viewing, {{which could lead to}} a de facto discrimination in employment against minority actors and writers. However, Nielsen countered the campaign by revealing its sample composition counts. According to Nielsen Media Research's sample composition counts, , nationwide, African American households using People Meters represented 6.7% of the Nielsen sample, compared to 6.0% in the general population. Latino households represent 5.7% of the Nielsen sample, compared to 5.0% in the general population.
