The trunkline runs southeast on Caberfae Highway over the Manistee River {{and through the}} Peters and Highpoint bayous. The highway passes near the community of Eastlake before turning eastward through forest land. In eastern Manistee County, the roadway crosses the Pine River south of the <b>Tippy</b> Dam Pond in Wellston. M-55 intersects M-37 in western Wexford County southwest of the Caberfae Peaks Ski & Golf Resort. The roadway turns northeasterly along the south shore of Lake Mitchell where it then curves southeasterly to run concurrently along M-115 along the south shore of Lake Cadillac and through {{the south side of}} Cadillac. At the interchange with the US131 freeway, M-55 merges north along the freeway, bypassing downtown Cadillac.|$|E
5|$|The game {{supports}} {{up to six}} {{human or}} artificial intelligence players in local and online multiplayer, except on the PlayStation 4, which has a human player limit of four per console. Videoball has team and ranked matchmaking multiplayer modes. There is no set practice game mode, but players can train against computer-controlled opponents in exhibition matches and the scenario-based Arcade mode, in which the player faces two computer-controlled opponents in specific level configurations. The Arcade mode artificial intelligence personalities each have fitting names, such as Homer (who stays near its endzone) and Punchy (who bullies players with projectiles). Some work in pairs to establish gameplay concepts, such as <b>Tippy,</b> who passes the ball to Toppy, who maintains {{the top of the}} field.|$|E

2500|$|Schmidt's 1934 squad {{opened the}} season with a 33–0 victory over Indiana, the initial shutout of the 25 {{registered}} during Schmidt's 56-game career at Ohio State. The first touchdown scored by a Schmidt team was a fake reverse that went for 78yards, epitomizing his style. The Buckeyes won seven of their eight games in 1934, four by shutout (including a 34–0 defeat of Michigan, the first of 4 straight seasons in which the Buckeyes held the Wolverines scoreless), but finished second in the Big Ten to National Champion Minnesota. The only loss of 1934, to Illinois in an away game that honored Red Grange, resulted from a missed point after touchdown. A 76–0 rout of Western Reserve ended scheduling against other Ohio universities until 1992. (Its record against in-state college opponents through 1934 was 153–45–15.) [...] Recognizing that he had been hired in part to beat Michigan, Schmidt's first four seasons saw victories over their archrival, all by shut-out, beginning with a 34–0 trouncing in 1934. Quarterback <b>Tippy</b> Dye became the first Buckeye signal caller to win three consecutive games over Michigan.|$|E
6000|$|Thus, {{gradually}} the Sol's Arms melts into the shadowy night and then flares {{out of it}} strong in gas. The Harmonic Meeting hour arriving, the gentleman of professional celebrity takes the chair, is faced (red-faced) by Little Swills; their friends rally round them and support first-rate talent. In the zenith of the evening, Little Swills says, [...] "Gentlemen, if you'll permit me, I'll attempt a short description of a scene of real life that came off here to-day." [...] Is much applauded and encouraged; goes {{out of the room}} as Swills; comes in as the coroner (not the least in the world like him); describes the inquest, with recreative intervals of piano-forte accompaniment, to the refrain: With his (the coroner's) <b>tippy</b> tol li doll, <b>tippy</b> tol lo doll, <b>tippy</b> tol li doll, Dee! ...|$|E

60|$|But in {{that case}} {{there would not be}} more than twelve Arabs with the prisoners. Were there any of the {{friendly}} ones among them? If <b>Tippy</b> Tilly and six of his men were there, and if Belmont could get his arms free and his hand upon his revolver, they might come through yet. The Colonel craned his neck and groaned in his disappointment. He could see the faces of the guards in the firelight. They were all Baggara Arabs, men who were beyond either pity or bribery. <b>Tippy</b> Tilly and the others must have gone on with the advance. For the first time the stiff old soldier abandoned hope.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe the}} fellow is {{friendly}} to us, but I can't quite make him out," [...] said Cochrane to Belmont. [...] "Do {{you think that}} he means that his name is <b>Tippy</b> Tilly, and that he killed Hicks Pasha?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I told <b>Tippy</b> Tilly that, if {{he could}} help us, we would turn him into a Bimbashi when we got him back into Egypt. I think he's willing enough if he only had the power. By Jove, Belmont, do {{look back at the}} river." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{trying to}} speak English. <b>Tippy</b> Tilly is as near as he can get to Egyptian Artillery. He has served in the Egyptian Artillery under Bimbashi Mortimer. He was taken {{prisoner}} when Hicks Pasha was destroyed, and had to turn Dervish to save his skin. How's that?" ...|$|E
60|$|Right {{across the}} desert, {{from north to}} south, there was drawn a white line, as {{straight}} and clear {{as if it had}} been slashed with chalk across a brown table.

60|$|Colonel Cochrane {{was awakened}} from his slumber by some one pulling at his shoulder. As his eyes opened they fell upon the black, anxious face of <b>Tippy</b> Tilly, the old Egyptian gunner.

6000|$|... "By Jove, I've got it!" [...] cried Belmont. [...] "He's {{trying to}} speak English. <b>Tippy</b> Tilly is as near as he can get to Egyptian Artillery.

60|$|Colonel Cochrane and <b>Tippy</b> Tilly {{had crept}} {{together}} {{under the shadow of}} the great acacia tree to the spot where the women were lying.

6000|$|... "Tell {{him that}} our minds are open then," [...] said the Colonel. [...] "I don't suppose the padre {{would have gone}} so far, {{but now that he}} is dead I think we may stretch a point. You go to him, Mansoor, and if you work it well we will agree to forget what is past. By the way, has <b>Tippy</b> Tilly said anything?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{friendly}} negro who {{had talked}} {{of himself as}} <b>Tippy</b> Tilly had managed to slip a piece of cloth soaked in water into the hand of Mr. Stephens, and Miss Adams had moistened her lips with it. Even the few drops had given her renewed strength, {{and now that the}} first crushing shock was over, her wiry, elastic, Yankee nature began to reassert itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we'll {{play the}} game out, but I'm not very hopeful," [...] said Cochrane. [...] "Of course, we must keep the best face we can before the women. I see that <b>Tippy</b> Tilly {{is as good as}} his word, for those five niggers and the two brown Johnnies must be the men he speaks of. They all ride {{together}} and keep well up, but I can't see how they are going to help us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep quiet, and they'll pass us," [...] {{whispered the}} Colonel, who was all himself again {{now that the}} hour for action had arrived. [...] "I wish to Heaven I could see <b>Tippy</b> Tilly or any of his friends. Now {{is the time for}} them to help us." [...] He watched the mad stream of fugitives as they flew past upon their shambling, squattering, loose-jointed beasts, but the black face of the Egyptian gunner was not among them.|$|E
60|$|After this speach, the old genlmn sunk {{down on the}} sofa, {{and puffed}} as much smoke {{out of his mouth}} as if he'd been the chimley of a steam-injian. I was pleased, I confess, with the sean, and liked to see this venrabble and virtuous old man a-nocking his son about the hed; just as Deuceace had done with Mr. Richard Blewitt, as I've before shown. Master's face was, fust, red-hot; next, chawk-white: and then sky-blew. He looked, for all the world, like Mr. <b>Tippy</b> Cooke in the tragady of Frankinstang. At last, he mannidged to speek.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was you who {{arranged}} with this excellent <b>Tippy</b> Tilly {{and the others}} {{that they should have}} so much if they brought us alive into Egypt again. They slipped away in the darkness and hid themselves in the grove. Then, when we were left, they crept up with their rifles and shot the men who were about to murder us. That cursed Moolah, I am sorry they shot him, for I believe that I could have persuaded him to be a Christian. And now, with your permission, I will hurry on and embrace Miss Adams, for Belmont has his wife, and Stephens has Miss Sadie, so I think it is very evident that the sympathy of Miss Adams is reserved for me." ...|$|E
