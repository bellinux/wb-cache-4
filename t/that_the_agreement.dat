5|$|In {{his opening}} statement, Krum argued that Burton had only agreed {{to act as}} general counsel and to allow his name {{to be placed in}} Rialto's literature, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> {{explicitly}} provided that Burton would never represent Rialto before any federal agency.|$|E
5|$|On Burton's first appeal, the Supreme Court {{reversed}} {{his convictions}} because venue and vicinage {{could not be}} proper in the Eastern District of Missouri on the sole ground that Burton's bank sent the check to St. Louis after he cashed it. Further, the Court cited the prejudicial refusal of jury instructions. After Burton was retried and convicted, the Court affirmed, inter alia, on the ground <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> between Burton and Rialto had occurred in St. Louis.|$|E

40|$|On June 30, 2015, in United States v. Apple, Inc., the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit {{held that}} Apple’s {{agreements}} with five publishing companies violated the Sherman Act. With Apple as a retailer and the publishers as manufacturers, <b>the</b> <b>agreements</b> between <b>the</b> {{two groups were}} vertical. This classification is significant because in 2007 in Leegin Creative Leather Products v. PSKS, Inc., the Supreme Court held that all vertical agreements should be analyzed {{under the rule of}} reason. Rather than looking at the structure of <b>the</b> <b>agreements,</b> however, <b>the</b> Second Circuit focused on the type of market restraint <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreements</b> imposed. Because <b>the</b> vertical <b>agreements</b> facilitated a horizontal conspiracy to raise and set ebook prices, <b>the</b> court reasoned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreements</b> were per se illegal. This Comment argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Second Circuit erred in finding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreements</b> were per se illegal. By ignoring the rule of reason analysis, the Second Circuit’s holding prevented Apple from demonstrating the procompetitive justifications for its agreements...|$|R
50|$|When the {{legality}} of the Certificates of Claim system was challenged in 1903 on <b>the</b> basis <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreements</b> made by <b>the</b> chiefs breached the rights of their community members, the Appeals Court upheld the validity of the certificates, but considered <b>that</b> many of <b>the</b> <b>agreements</b> were unfair and one-sided.|$|R
5|$|On February 11, 2010, Red Eagle Games and Obsidian {{announced}} that they would co-develop one or more games based on The Wheel of Time fantasy novel series by Robert Jordan.

5|$|On March 23, the {{prosecution}} began its case in chief. Post Office Department employees identified {{the letters of}} complaint received against Rialto. Ernest H. Kastor, of a St. Louis advertising firm, testified that he introduced Burton to Dennis and Harlan in November 1902. Witnesses said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> was as Krum described and that the pay was agreed as $2,500 in $500 installments. Dyer read into evidence the letter from Burton to Rialto.|$|E
5|$|A {{pressing}} issue {{not resolved}} by Wilson {{was the question}} of policy towards Bolshevik Russia. The U.S. had been among the nations that had sent troops there after the Russian Revolution. Afterwards, Wilson refused to recognize the Russian SFSR. Under Harding, Commerce Secretary Hoover, with considerable experience of Russian affairs, took the lead on policy. When famine struck Russia in 1921, Hoover had the American Relief Administration, which he had headed, negotiate with the Russians to provide aid. Soviet leaders (the U.S.S.R. was established in 1922) hoped in vain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> would lead to recognition. Hoover supported trade with the Soviets, fearing U.S. companies would be frozen out of the Soviet market, but Hughes opposed this, and the matter was not resolved under Harding's presidency.|$|E

5|$|Despite the ceasefire {{agreement}} {{signed on}} 22 September between the JNA and Croatia, which {{provided for the}} resumption of supplies to the JNA barracks, the authorities in Bjelovar refused to restore utilities, claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> allowed for the supply of JNA officers and soldiers only, {{but there were also}} civilians sheltering in the barracks. On 27 September, the Croatian General Staff directed that the garrison be captured on 28–30 September. Tus, acting as the Chief of the General Staff, ordered the clandestine killing of extremists before they caused mass killing of civilians or great material damage. According to Tus, this order was based on an assessment that there were extremist JNA officers present in Bjelovar, intent on carrying out such acts.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Burton {{argued that}} the Eastern District of Missouri was an unconstitutional venue and vicinage (an {{argument}} that the Court had accepted in Burton I). This time, the Court rejected the argument. The Court held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> had occurred in St. Louis (as the jury had been instructed that it was required to find) based on Rialto's acceptance in St. Louis, the telegram, and the letter. The Court bolstered this view by citation to its own and other precedents concerning offer and acceptance in contract law. The Court further cited its earlier precedents holding that the venue provision of Article III {{does not require the}} physical presence of the defendant in the forum state.|$|E
5|$|In June 1651, Frederick William {{broke the}} {{provisions}} of the Peace of Westphalia by invading Jülich-Berg, bordering his possessions in Cleves-Mark at the lower Rhine river. The Treaty of Xanten, which had ended the War of the Jülich succession between Brandenburg and the count palatines in 1614, had partitioned the once united Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg among the belligerents, and Jülich-Berg was since ruled by the Catholic counts of Palatinate-Neuburg. After the Thirty Years' War, Wolfgang William, Count Palatine of Neuburg, disregarded a 1647 agreement with Frederick William which had favored the Protestants in the duchies, while Frederick William insisted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> be upheld. Besides these religious motives, Frederick William's invasion also aimed at territorial expansion.|$|E

5|$|In June 2010, Jack Thorpe filed {{a federal}} {{lawsuit against the}} borough of Jim Thorpe, seeking to have his father's remains {{returned}} to his homeland and re-interred near other family members in Oklahoma. Citing the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, Jack was arguing to bring his father's remains to the reservation in Oklahoma, {{where they would be}} buried near those of his father, sisters and brother, a mile from the place he was born. He claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> between his stepmother and Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, borough officials was made against the wishes of other family members who want him buried in Native American land. Jack Thorpe died at 73 on February 22, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, Gillard {{announced}} that Australia and Malaysia were finalising an arrangement to exchange asylum seekers.

Australia would take 4,000 people from Malaysia who have previously been assessed as being refugees. However, on 31 August, the High Court ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> to transfer refugees from Australia to Malaysia was invalid, and ordered that it not proceed. Australia would still accept 4,000 {{people who have been}} assessed as refugees in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Lad: A Dog was {{published}} by Dutton in April 1919, {{a year after the}} real-life Lad's death. Terhune continued receiving royalties for the novel up through his own death. His wife, Anice Terhune, ceased receiving the royalties after she surrendered the rights to them, along with those of Bruce and His Dog in exchange for E.P. Dutton agreeing to publish and perpetually print her work Across the Line, a supposed set of conversations she had with her late husband. With this agreement, Dutton became sole owners of the copyright to Lad: A Dog. Macrae later decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> was not completely fair to Anice and modified it to provide her a payment of $100 a month {{for the rest of her}} life, likely exceeding the profits they earned on the novels as the years passed.|$|E

5|$|Ladislaus Löb {{writes that}} {{proposals}} and counter-proposals flew between Istanbul, London and Washington. The Jewish Agency and Brand wanted the Allies to string the Germans {{along in the}} hope of slowing the deportations. The Agency gave Brand a document, dated 29 May 1944, that offered $400,000 for every 1,000 Jewish emigrants to Palestine, one million Swiss francs per 10,000 Jewish emigrants to neutral countries such as Spain, and 10,000 Swiss francs a month if the deportations were to stop. If the SS would allow the Allies to supply food, clothes and medicine to the Jews in concentration camps, the Nazis would be supplied with the same.

5|$|Macdonald {{was content}} to lead the Conservatives in a relaxed manner in {{opposition}} and await Liberal mistakes. He took long holidays and resumed his law practice, moving his family to Toronto and going into partnership with his son Hugh John. One mistake that Macdonald believed the Liberals had made was a free-trade agreement with Washington, negotiated in 1874; Macdonald {{had come to believe}} that protection was necessary to build Canadian industry. The Panic of 1873 had led to a worldwide depression; the Liberals found it difficult to finance the railroad in such a climate, and were generally opposed to the line anyway—the slow pace of construction led to British Columbia claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> under which it had entered Confederation was in jeopardy of being broken.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the NFLPA {{declared}} itself an independent union, many players were dissatisfied {{with the lack of}} compensation teams provided and voted to strike on July 3, 1968 after official discussions with the owners stalled. The owners countered by declaring a lockout. By July 14, 1968, the brief work stoppage came to an end. Although a CBA resulted, many players felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> did not net them as many benefits as they had hoped. The owners agreed to contribute about $1.5 million to the pension fund with minimum salaries of $9,000 for rookies, $10,000 for veterans and $50 per exhibition game; there was at yet no neutral arbitration for disputes.|$|E

Eager for new land, many United States settlers refused to recognize the agreement. Several filibusters raised armies to invade the area west of the Sabine River.

5|$|While the Lithuanian side {{considered}} {{the agreement to}} be an enforceable political treaty, the Polish side considered {{it to be a}} minor military agreement, later superseded by a ceasefire agreement between Lithuania and Żeligowski reached on November 29. American historian Alfred Erich Senn has argued {{that it was not a}} regular political treaty, as it did not require ratification, but the presence of political representatives of both sides indicated that it was not a mere military agreement. Poland and Lithuania also disagreed about the agreement's relation to the Vilnius question, which was not explicitly addressed in the treaty. The Lithuanian side considered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> assigned Vilnius to Lithuania, while the Polish side argued that it did not concern Vilnius or other territorial claims.
