25|$|The fourth plane {{apparently}} {{had been holding}} back waiting for his colleagues to open a favorable route of attack. He then circled, banked to his left, and dove at Tatum. Her barrage ripped off part of his left wing, and he plummeted <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> splashing into the sea about 30feet from her port bow. Then an underwater explosion rocked Tatum severely but caused no damage.|$|E
25|$|Some part {{of these}} {{chemicals}} leaves the field. Nitrogen in forms such as nitrate (NO3) is highly soluble, and along with some pesticides infiltrates downwards <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table, where it can migrate to water wells, rivers and streams. A 2008 National Research Council study found that regionally the highest stream concentrations occur where the rates of application were highest, and that these rates were highest in the Corn Belt. These flows mainly stem from corn, which as of 2010 was {{the major source of}} total nitrogen loading to the Mississippi River.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{there were}} {{considerable}} discrepancies between different accounts, most {{witnesses to the}} accident had seen a [...] "streak of light" [...] that was unanimously described as ascending, moving {{to a point where}} a large fireball appeared, with several witnesses reporting that the fireball split in two as it descended <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> There was intense public interest in these witness reports and much speculation that the reported streak of light was a missile that had struck TWA 800, causing the airplane to explode. These witness accounts were a major reason for the initiation and duration of the FBI's criminal investigation.|$|E

60|$|Then, {{before he}} could turn back, Allen felt the bridge sagging beneath him. Suddenly it parted in the center, and horse and youth went {{plunging}} headlong <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> far beneath.|$|R

2500|$|The two {{remaining}} canoes, Catfish and Crayfish, reached Bordeaux {{on the fifth}} night, 11/12 December; the river was flat calm {{and there was a}} clear sky. The attack started at 21:00 hours 11 December, Hasler and Sparks in Catfish attacking shipping on the western side of the dock, placed eight limpet mines on four vessels including a Sperrbrecher patrol boat. A sentry {{on the deck of the}} Sperrbrecher, apparently spotting something, shone his torch down <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> but the camouflaged canoe evaded detection in the darkness. They had planted all their mines and left the harbour with the ebb tide at 00:45 hours. At the same time Laver and Mills in Crayfish [...] had reached the eastern side of the dock without finding any targets, so returned to deal with the ships docked at Bassens. They placed eight limpet mines on two vessels, five on a large cargo ship and three on a small liner.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the roof}} was completed, the {{reflecting}} pool was constructed on top of it. The landscape architects Clarke and Rapuano designed the [...] deep, [...] pool. The pool walls were [...] thick at the base, and tapered as they rose. A sheet of monel (a rustproof nickel alloy metal) was embedded in the wall, rising to within [...] {{of the top of}} the wall. The entire wall was coated in epoxy as a waterproofer. Nine [...] steel girders acted both to support the pool above and the ceiling of the main exhibition hall below. These steel girders were nearly [...] below ground to accommodate the pool's construction. On top of the girders were double-tongued, prestressed, precast concrete T-beams. The tongue of each T-beam was [...] thick, and the height of the T-beam [...] A [...] thick layer of concrete was laid atop the T-beams, forming the floor of the pool. Five layers of roofing felt were laid atop the concrete floor, followed by a [...] layer of perlite. A grid of concrete beams, each [...] and over [...] long, was laid in the perlite to support the layers above. Inverted U-shaped drainage tiles were inserted between the beams to help remove any water which leaked from above. A [...] thick sheet of polyethylene formed a moisture barrier above the perlite, and [...] thick layer of concrete laid atop the moisture barrier. The bottom of the pool consisted of another five layers of roofing felt, on top of which were laid a [...] thick layer of gravel. [...] The gravel-impregnated grout was laid down in alternating grey and white sections (each section separated by a brass rail), to add visual distinctiveness {{to the bottom of the}} pool. The granite for the lip of the pool was imported from West Germany. The granite, which was shaped to wrap around the exterior, top, and interior of the lip, was about [...] thick. [...] The lip of the pool was made of concrete. It was [...] wide, and dropped in a pitch of [...] was it extended <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Overflow drains were placed at intervals on the inside of the lip, just below the granite cladding. A gutter just outside the pool provided extra diversion in case water spilled over the lip. Grey granite slabs, also imported from West Germany, formed a sidewalk around the pool.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} was positioned {{so that a}} corner points out <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of <b>the</b> Inner Harbor, suggesting the prow of a ship.

60|$|As {{we stood}} on deck, {{regardless}} {{of the possibility that}} some of the enemy might come that way, a man ran down <b>the</b> street <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>water's</b> edge, waving his arms about and otherwise acting as if nearly beside himself with joy or grief.|$|R

50|$|Hatchlings {{are around}} 1 mm long and grow rapidly, {{reaching}} {{a length of}} 7 mm after a month.

60|$|When we were {{come near}} to my Lord Cornwallis's headquarters, I noted with {{surprise}} that a goodly {{number of the}} soldiers, together with a large sprinkling of officers, were pressing on <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>water's</b> edge, {{and it was no}} more than natural Pierre and I should follow the throng, excited as we were by seeing the privates throw down shovel or pick without permission, to chase at the heels of their superiors.|$|R
60|$|The {{smoke from}} the fire was forcing me further and further back down <b>the</b> {{corridor}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> which I could hear surging through the darkness. With my men had gone the last torch, nor was this corridor lighted by the radiance of phosphorescent rock as were those of the lower levels. It was this fact that assured me that I was {{not far from the}} upper pits which lie directly beneath the temple.|$|R
60|$|It was a boa, moving lazily <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{course as}} if {{conscious}} that its own wonderful strength {{was sufficient to}} enable it to cope successfully with all enemies.|$|E

60|$|Even as {{she breathed}} a silent prayer of thanksgiving, {{she saw a}} sudden {{expression}} of triumph lighten {{the features of the}} cursing Russian, and at the same instant he dropped suddenly to the ground, grasping firmly upon something which wriggled through the mud <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

A large storm system involving the remnants of Gonzalo battered the British Isles and central Europe on October 21, killing three people in the United Kingdom and severely hindering transportation. The system later {{played a role in}} triggering torrential rains over the Balkans, which resulted in severe flooding in Greece and Bulgaria.|$|R

60|$|We {{had built}} her upon a low {{bank of the}} river close to where it emptied into the sea, and just above high tide.
