2500|$|On 21 June 1993, Heseltine {{suffered}} a major heart attack while in Venice, {{which led to}} concerns {{about his ability to}} remain in government after he was shown on television leaving hospital in a wheelchair. In 1994 Chris Morris jokingly implied on BBC Radio 1 that Heseltine had died, and persuaded MP Jerry Hayes to broadcast an on-air tribute. Morris was subsequently suspended. Heseltine, who after being seen as an arriviste in his younger days was now something of a grandee and elder statesman. [...] In 1994 he re-emerged as a serious political player, helped by his flirting with the idea of privatising the Post Office. [...] His testimony for the Scott Report during the Arms-to-Iraq Inquiry (whose report eventually appeared in 1996) revealed that he had refused to sign the certificates attempting <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>evidence.</b> The cover of Private Eye announced [...] "A Legend Lives" [...] and one major newspaper ended an editorial by proclaiming that the [...] "balance of probability" [...] was that Heseltine would be Prime Minister {{before the end of the}} year – this being at a time when John Major's leadership had lost much credibility after the scandals following his [...] "Back to Basics" [...] speech. However, there was to be no leadership election that autumn.|$|E
60|$|Beyond this Foster's {{plans were}} vague; {{he did not}} know, for example, how he could force Daly to keep Lawrence's secret, without {{promising}} <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>evidence</b> that would bring the man to justice. But he might find a way and was tired of puzzling about the matter. In a sense, {{he had taken a}} ridiculous line from the beginning and perhaps involved himself in needless difficulties. His partner, however, must be protected, and in the meantime he had two objects; to avoid the police and Graham.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2012, the Daily Mail {{newspaper}} {{alleged that}} Evans had been leading a [...] "lobbying campaign" [...] {{to allow the}} use of secret evidence in court, and give government ministers [...] "sweeping powers" [...] <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>evidence</b> they deem 'sensitive' from civil court hearings and inquests.|$|E
50|$|The NSW {{government}} was allowed <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> some <b>evidence</b> in the case.|$|R
50|$|In 2011 a Texas man, Michael Morton was {{released}} from prison after serving nearly 25 years for the murder of his wife in 1987. He {{was released}} after DNA evidence pointed to another man as the killer. The prosecutor, Ken Anderson later plead guilty <b>to</b> <b>withholding</b> <b>evidence</b> that could have helped Morton fight the murder charge. He was sentenced to spend 10 days in jail and was also disbarred.|$|R
50|$|Further, Director Freeh {{criticized the}} Commission for {{allowing}} the Pentagon <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> key <b>evidence</b> {{about the facts}} found by Able Danger and concluded that these inadequacies raised {{serious questions about the}} credibility of the 9/11 Commission.|$|R
50|$|While {{his first}} {{marriage}} to a Roman Catholic suggests a certain personal tolerance {{of the practice of}} Catholicism, one of his best-known judgments, Butler v. Moore, held that a priest has no privilege <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>evidence</b> of what was said under the seal of the confessional. This decision was overruled in the twentieth century.|$|E
50|$|While not {{specifically}} recommending a cover-up {{of evidence of}} extraterrestrial life, the report does suggest that contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life (or strong evidence of its reality) could have a disruptive effect on human societies. Moreover, it does mention the possibility that leadership might wish <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>evidence</b> of extraterrestrial life from the public under some conditions.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Let's Doo Wop It Again", he said [...] "It's {{more fun}} to keep things from Lassie" [...] Lassiter, which {{eventually}} resulted in Gus's friends getting kidnapped, and in [...] "True Grits", he asked Officer McNab <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>evidence</b> from Juliet (McNab refused). He also told Juliet that 'Santa Barbara would be Detroit' if it weren't for him.|$|E
50|$|On December 16, 2006, it was {{revealed}} that Nifong and DNA lab director Brian Meehan conspired <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> exculpatory DNA <b>evidence</b> from the final report submitted to the defense team.|$|R
6000|$|Humfrey was {{accordingly}} called, and, privately admonished by {{his father}} that he must not allow any scruples about bringing his playmate into trouble to lead him <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> his <b>evidence,</b> or shrink from telling the whole truth as he knew it, Humfrey accordingly stood before the Earl and made his replies a little sullenly but quite straightforwardly. He had prevented the whistle from being given to his sister for the huckstress because the woman was a witch, who frightened her, and moreover {{he knew it was}} against rules. Did he suspect that the whistle came from the Queen of Scots? ...|$|R
60|$|There {{seemed to}} be one of two only courses left him: to provide Mr. Caryll with the means of escape, or else <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> such <b>evidence</b> as he {{intended}} to supply against him, and to persuade--to compel, if necessary--his mother to do the same. When all was said, his interests need not suffer very greatly. His position would not be quite so strong, perhaps, if he but betrayed a plot without delivering up any of the plotters; still, he thought, it should be strong enough. His father dead, out of consideration of the signal loyalty his act must manifest, he thought the government would prove grateful and forbear from prosecuting a claim for restitution against the Ostermore estates.|$|R
50|$|At the Assizes, Constance Kent pleaded guilty, and her plea was {{accepted}} so that Wagner was not again called. The position that he assumed before the magistrates caused much public {{debate in the}} press. There was considerable expression of public indignation {{that it should have}} been suggested that he could have any right as against the state <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>evidence</b> on the ground that he had put forward. The indignation seems to have been largely directed against the assumption that sacramental confession was known to the Church of England.|$|E
50|$|The {{action is}} set in San Francisco and the film opens in a {{documentary}} style. When the evidence in a murder case points to a young woman as the main suspect, both her boyfriend, a police detective, and a struggling songwriter who is playing piano in a bar, decide <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>evidence</b> from the police. Later, the girl, knowing that the songwriter did not commit the murder, helps him to escape from a police dragnet when he becomes the main suspect. Eventually, new clues point to someone else as the culprit. Quite an entertaining thriller.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{debilitating}} scandals included [...] "Arms to Iraq" [...] - {{the ongoing}} inquiry into how government ministers including Alan Clark (also {{involved in an}} unrelated scandal involving the revelation of his affair with the wife and both daughters of a South African judge) had encouraged businesses to supply arms to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, in breach of the official arms embargo, and how senior ministers had, on legal advice, attempted <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>evidence</b> of this official connivance when directors of Matrix Churchill were put on trial for breaking the embargo.|$|E
25|$|US District Court Judge in Washington DC Emmet G. Sullivan, on October 2, 2008, {{denied the}} mistrial {{petition}} of Stevens's chief counsel, Brendan Sullivan, due <b>to</b> allegations of <b>withholding</b> <b>evidence</b> by prosecutors. Thus, {{the latter were}} admonished, and would submit themselves for internal probe by the United States Department of Justice. Brady v. Maryland requires prosecutors to give a defendant any material exculpatory evidence. Judge Sullivan had earlier admonished the prosecution for sending home to Alaska a witness who might have helped the defense.|$|R
5000|$|Immediately {{following}} his discharge, Kallmeyer was personally recruited by Brack for Action T4. Along with August Becker and Albert Widmann, Kallmeyer {{was one of}} the three chemists primarily involved with the murderous program. These men, familiar with the uses of gas and poison, supplied professional services essential for the success of the killings. There exists little paperwork on Kallmeyer's involvement within T4, and the Kallmeyers' postwar testimonies appear <b>to</b> be <b>withholding</b> <b>evidence.</b> [...] A letter from Alfred Wetzel of the Reich Ministry of the Occupied Eastern Territories to Hinrich Lohse attests that Viktor Brack wanted disabled Jews in Riga to be gassed by [...] "Brack's devices". For this purpose, Brack offered his chemist, Dr. Kallmeyer, and other assistants. Ultimately, this plan was not carried out in the Baltic States.|$|R
5000|$|Because Shawn isn't an {{official}} detective, he often has to resort <b>to</b> stealing, <b>withholding</b> <b>evidence,</b> obstruction of justice, tampering with evidence and witnesses, {{breaking and entering}} and numerous other crimes in order to solve a crime. Despite his high intelligence, Shawn does {{appear to have a}} poor grasp of history and other fields (assigned to write about a U.S. President, he wrote a paper on the fictional character from the movie [...] "Dave" [...] who he thought was real). He is also chided by Henry for not knowing all the details of a case beforehand (in one episode, Shawn is about to accuse an innocent man of murder before Henry stops him and reveals a detail Shawn would know from the case file he didn't read). Often, Shawn will accept a case without fully checking out the client or the details itself yet brush it off.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, the delicts {{committed}} by Mapuche activists have been prosecuted under counter-terrorism legislation, originally {{introduced by the}} military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet to control political dissidents. The law allows prosecutors <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>evidence</b> from the defense {{for up to six}} months and to conceal the identity of witnesses, who may give evidence in court behind screens. Violent activist groups, such as the Coordinadora Arauco Malleco, use tactics such as burning of structures and pastures, and death threats against people and their families. Protesters from Mapuche communities have used these tactics against properties of both multinational forestry corporations and private individuals. In 2010 the Mapuche launched a number of hunger strikes in attempts to effect change in the anti-terrorism legislation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{privilege}} {{was first}} officially {{recognized by the}} Supreme Court of the United States in United States v. Reynolds, [...] A military airplane, a B-29 Superfortress bomber, crashed. The widows of three civilian crew members sought accident reports on the crash but were told that to release such details would threaten national security by revealing the bomber's top-secret mission. The court held that only the government can claim or waive the privilege, but that it “is not to be lightly invoked” and that there “must be a formal claim of privilege, lodged {{by the head of}} thedepartment which has control over the matter, after actual personalconsideration by that officer.” The court stressed that the decision <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>evidence</b> is to be made by the presiding judge and not the executive.|$|E
5000|$|McMath's {{courtroom}} victories {{were all}} the more remarkable for being won in an era of [...] "blue ribbon" [...] juries handpicked by commissioners, themselves selected by state court judges beholden to insurance defense law firms from whom they received thousands of dollars in non-reportable (and non-refundable) campaign contributions for re-election races in which few were ever opposed. Factory workers, blacks, union members, ordinary laborers and other wage earners were often excluded from panels which were heavily weighted with bank and insurance company employees, mid-level managers, realtors, small business owners, salaried professionals, country club members and others hostile to claimants. Federal court juries were somewhat more diverse, but U.S. district judges, invariably former corporate counsel, had broader powers to dismiss cases summarily, overturn verdicts, and <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>evidence</b> favorable to the plainitff—rulings which often occurred, necessitating lengthy appeals before some cases could be fully tried. Many did not survive this gauntlet.|$|E
50|$|The defence {{claimed that}} the {{prosecution}} had also tried <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> certain <b>evidences</b> and witnesses. One investigating officer initially a prosecution witness, was not called during the second case. He had to be presented by the defence. The prosecution also had tried to suppress evidence that proved that the girl had given her hostel fees {{to one of the}} accused. The evidence, regarding a letter left by the girl on the day she vanished, was also suppressed. The initial statements given to various officers after her reappearance were presented a very late date, as a result the defence couldn't make a good case or cross examine the victim properly. They called these unfair towards the accused. The defence also pointed to an early statement made by the father which proved that, he was aware that the girl had run away, not kidnapped.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the episode}} Odor in the Court, as Claire {{goes to trial}} for murdering Fey, some new {{evidence}} surfaces in the Love Dungeon, along {{with a bottle of}} perfume Claire gives to Betty for safekeeping during the trial. Fey's diary reveals in an attempt to kill Claire, Fey had sent a bottle of poisoned perfume to Bradford to give to Claire as a [...] "souvenir" [...] that would drive her to madness and kill her. By a stroke of fate, Claire's insanity resulted in Fey's own death instead. However, Amanda chooses <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> this <b>evidence</b> as she blames Claire for killing her mother. After Betty nearly kills herself with the perfume, and after Amanda is convinced to hand over the evidence, Claire Meade is found not guilty and freed. Therefore, MODE is now back in her control.|$|R
50|$|In March 2006, she {{was hired}} as a {{stripper}} at a party organized by members of the Duke University men's lacrosse team. After arriving, intoxicated, with a fellow stripper at a house rented by three of the team captains, she became involved in an argument with the occupants of the house, and left. She then had an altercation with her fellow stripper that necessitated police assistance. At this point she made an allegation that she had been raped at the party. District Attorney Mike Nifong, up for reelection, pursued the case despite questions about the credibility of Mangum, and conspired <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> exculpatory <b>evidence</b> that failed to demonstrate that Mangum had been raped by the Duke lacrosse players. It took almost a year for the state's attorney general's office to dismiss the charges and declare that the players were innocent of the charges laid against them by Nifong.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2005, Dr Alan Williams, the Home Office {{pathologist}} {{who conducted}} the postmortem examinations on both the Clark babies, was banned from Home Office pathology work and coroners' cases for {{three years after the}} General Medical Council found him guilty of [...] "serious professional misconduct" [...] in the Clark case. [...] At the same time he had chosen <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>evidence</b> of infection as a possible cause of the death of the second baby, he changed his original opinion regarding the first baby from death caused by lower respiratory infection to unnatural death by smothering. He failed to give any good reason for this change in opinion and his competence was called into question. His conduct was severely criticised by other experts giving evidence and opinion to the court and in the judicial summing up of the successful second appeal. He was given the opportunity to address the court to explain his decision to withhold the laboratory results. He declined to do so. The decision of the GMC was upheld by the High Court in November 2007. Earlier that year he had successfully appealed against the decision to ban him from performing Home Office postmortem examinations; the ban was replaced by an 18-month suspension which by then had passed.|$|E

5000|$|In June 2012, the retrial {{was ordered}} by the Tokyo High Court {{in the face of}} new {{evidence}} that emerged the previous year. Swabs of semen recovered from inside the victim's body, which the prosecution claimed were too small a sample to analyze using existing technologies at the time, finally underwent DNA testing in July 2011, and ruled out Mainali as its owner. The semen's DNA matched a piece of body hair (pubic hair) from the crime scene already established to be from an individual other than Mainali. The DNA was further matched to the blood stain on the Burberry coat the victim was wearing, and the saliva found on the victim's chest. [...] The saliva on her breast was already known to be of O type blood (Mainali is type B), and the prosecution knew it did not match Mainali, but did not present the evidence at trial, and withheld it from the defense attorneys until September 2011. Japan does not have an equivalent of Brady disclosure rules as in the US, which would have made failure to disclose salient evidence to the defense censurable as prosecutorial misconduct. In 2005, the Supreme Prosecutor's Office revised its Code of Criminal Procedure requiring prosecutors to present a list of evidence gathered. But the revised code carries no penalties for violations thus offering little deterrent to prosecutors who may choose <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Efraim Karsh, {{professor}} of Mediterranean Studies at King's College London, writes that Morris engages in what Karsh calls [...] "five types of distortion". According to Karsh, Morris [...] "misrepresents documents, resorts <b>to</b> partial quotes, <b>withholds</b> <b>evidence,</b> makes false assertions, and rewrites original documents... tells of statements never made, decisions never taken, events {{that never happened}} ... at times [...] does not even take the trouble to provide evidence..... He expects his readers to take on trust his assertions that fundamental contradictions exist between published accounts and the underlying documents.....he systematically falsifies evidence. Indeed, there is scarcely a document {{that he does not}} twist. This casts serious doubt on the validity of his entire work." [...] In addition he claimed to expose a serious gap between Morris’ text and the original diary of Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister of Israel.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2009, FBI agent Chad Joy filed a {{whistleblower}} affidavit, {{alleging that}} prosecutors and FBI agents conspired <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> and conceal <b>evidence</b> {{that could have}} resulted in a verdict of [...] "not guilty." [...] In his affidavit, Joy alleged that prosecutors intentionally sent a key witness back to Alaska after the witness performed poorly during a mock cross examination. The witness, Rocky Williams, later notified the defense attorneys that his testimony would undercut the prosecution's claim that his company had spent its own money renovating Sen. Stevens's house. Joy further alleged that the prosecutors intentionally withheld Brady material including redacted prior statements of a witness, and a memo from Bill Allen stating that Sen. Stevens probably would have paid for the goods and services if asked. Joy further alleged that a female FBI agent had an inappropriate relationship with Allen, who also gave gifts to FBI agents and helped one agent's relative get a job.|$|R
