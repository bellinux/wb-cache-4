It is more common, however, for a clan chiefs to wear their own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their motto or slogan (pictured left). The chief's crest badge does not contain the strap and buckle that other clan members are permitted to wear. Clan chiefs are also entitled to wear three eagle feathers behind the circlet of their crest badge. On certain occasions, such as clan gatherings, it may be appropriate to use real eagle feathers. Clan chiefs that {{are members of the}} British Peerage or a feudal baron are entitled to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge, though <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> personal preference.|$|E

25|$|There is {{considerable}} controversy over Hirsch's legacy; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> debate amongst three parties: Haredi (sometimes called Ultra-Orthodox), Modern Orthodox, and Hirsch's descendants.

25|$|In Antiquity, both Bulgaria and Romania were {{inhabited}} by Thracian tribes, {{contributing to the}} ethnogenesis of the Romanian people and possibly the Bulgarian people (along with Slavs and Bulgars), although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> dispute. During the Migration Period, both the Slavs and the Bulgars crossed what is today Romania to settle in the plains south of the Danube, establishing the First Bulgarian Empire in the 7th century. In the Middle Ages, the lands between the Danube and the Carpathians were scarcely settled, but they were often at least nominally under Bulgarian control in the 9th and 10th century, as well as during some periods of the Second Bulgarian Empire.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> vital {{importance}} {{because a}} problem of economic development is identifying the membership of customary landowning groups and the owners. Disputes between mining and forestry companies and landowner groups often devolve {{on the issue of}} whether the companies entered into contractual relations for the use of land with the true owners. Customary property — usually land — cannot be devised by will. It can only be inherited according to the custom of the deceased's people. The Lands Act was amended in 2010 along with the Land Group Incorporation Act, intended to improve the management of state land, mechanisms for dispute resolution over land, and to enable customary landowners to be better able to access finance and possible partnerships over portions of their land, if they seek to develop it for urban or rural economic activities. The Land Group Incorporation Act requires more specific identification of the customary landowners than hitherto and their more specific authorisation before any land arrangements are determined; (a major issue {{in recent years has been}} a land grab, using, or rather misusing, the Lease-Leaseback provision under the Land Act, notably using 'Special Agricultural and Business Leases' (SABLs) to acquire vast tracts of customary land, purportedly for agricultural projects, but in an almost all cases as a back-door mechanism for securing tropical forest resources for logging — circumventing the more exacting requirements of the Forest Act, for securing Timber Permits (which must comply with sustainability requirements and be competitively secured, and with the customary landowners approval). Following a national outcry, these SABLs have been subject to a Commission of Inquiry, established in mid-2011, for which the report is still awaited for initial presentation to the Prime Minister and Parliament.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{multitude}} of slaves, hired labour was often needed, especially at harvest. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of contract, and the employer, who usually paid in advance, might demand a collateral against fulfillment of the work. Cattle were hired for ploughing, working the watering machines, carting, threshing, etc. The Code fixed a statutory wage for sowers, ox-drivers, field-labourers, and hire for oxen, asses, etc.|$|R

500|$|In Singapore, {{the rule}} of law {{doctrine}} has been the topic of considerable disagreement and debate, largely through differing conceptions of the doctrine. These conceptions can generally be divided into two categories developed by legal academics, the [...] "thin", or formal, conception and the [...] "thick", or substantive, conception of {{the rule of}} law. The thin conception, often associated with the legal scholars Albert Venn Dicey and Joseph Raz, advocates the view that {{the rule of law}} is fulfilled by adhering to formal procedures and requirements, such as the stipulations that all laws be prospective, clear, stable and constitutionally enacted, and that the parties to legal disputes are treated equally and without bias on the part of judges. While people subscribing to the thin conception do not dismiss the importance of the content of the law, they take the view that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> substantive justice and should not be regarded as part of the concept {{of the rule of law}}. On the other hand, the thick conception of the rule of law entails the notion that in addition to the requirements of the thin rule, it is necessary for the law to conform with certain substantive standards of justice and human rights.|$|E
