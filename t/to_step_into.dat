5|$|Fan {{attention}} {{became so}} intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number {{out of the public}} directory, and eventually he and Edith moved to Bournemouth, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class. Tolkien's status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow Inklings. Edith, however, was overjoyed <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Some {{commentators}} {{suggested the}} discovery and subsequent positive exposure and good morale {{around the city}} contributed to Leicester City F.C.'s shock Premier League victory in 2016. A {{few days after the}} burial, Leicester City began a winning streak to take them from bottom of the league to comfortably avoiding relegation, and they {{went on to win the}} league the following year. Mayor Peter Soulsby said:For too long, people in Leicester have been modest about their achievements and the city they live in. Now - thanks first to the discovery of King Richard III and the Foxes' phenomenal season - it's our time <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> the international limelight.and:It has been said that we are somehow being repaid for burying Richard with honour in our cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2003–04 season began, the Spurs {{lost their}} {{perennial}} captain David Robinson to retirement. Embracing the lone team leader role, Duncan led a reformed Spurs team which included Slovenian center Rasho Nesterovič, defensive stalwart Bruce Bowen, Argentinian shooting guard Ginóbili and young French point guard Parker. Coming {{off the bench}} were clutch shooting power forward Robert Horry, versatile Hedo Türkoğlu and veterans Malik Rose and Kevin Willis. In retrospect, Robinson commented that at first, Duncan was reluctant <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> the void, still needing some time to truly develop his leadership skills. Statistically though, Duncan remained strong; after another convincing season with averages of 22.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.7 blocks, he led the Spurs into the Western Conference Semifinals. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers again, split the series 2–2, and in Game 5, Duncan made a toughly defended jump shot which put the Spurs ahead by one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. Despite the little time remaining, Lakers point guard Derek Fisher hit a buzzer beater for an upset Lakers win. In the end, the Spurs lost the series 4–2, and Duncan attributed the strong Lakers defense {{as one of the}} reasons for the loss.|$|E
5|$|Muller {{was destined}} <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> his father's {{footsteps}} {{and become a}} businessman. He first attended the private institution Delfos followed by the Hogere Burgerschool (high school) in Rotterdam, before continuing his education in Germany, at the Hohe Real Schule in Frankfurt-am-Main, to specialise in trade and business. After finishing his studies with good results, he continued his training with internships in business firms in Liverpool, Manchester, and Marseilles. His first serious job came when his father called him back to Rotterdam in 1882, to become interim manager of the Handels Compagnie Mozambique (Trading Company Mozambique), an ill-performing trading firm doing business in Mozambique. In 1882/'83 Muller travelled to East Africa and visited all the trading posts and establishments of the firm, changing business practices. At {{the end of his}} trip he made an extensive tour of South Africa, visiting Natal, Zululand, Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and the Cape Colony. On his return to Rotterdam he advised the directors of the company on business opportunities. Subsequently he was appointed co-director of the reconstituted company, now called the Oost-Afrikaansche Compagnie (East African Company), as well as deputy manager in his father's firm, Hendrik Muller & Co., which had important trading interests in Liberia and elsewhere in West Africa.|$|E
5|$|The Mediterranean had at {{this time}} fallen {{into the hands of}} pirates, largely from Cilicia. Rome had {{destroyed}} many of the states that had previously policed the Mediterranean with fleets, but had failed <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> the gap created. The pirates had seized the opportunity of a relative power vacuum and had not only strangled shipping lanes but had plundered many cities on the coasts of Greece and Asia, and had even made descents upon Italy itself. After the Roman admiral Marcus Antonius Creticus (father of the triumvir Marcus Antonius) failed to clear the pirates to the satisfaction of the Roman authorities, Pompey was nominated his successor as commander of a special naval task force to campaign against them. It supposedly took Pompey just forty days to clear the western portion of the western Mediterranean of pirates, and restore communication between Iberia, Africa, and Italy. Plutarch describes how Pompey first swept their craft from the Mediterranean in a series of small actions and through the promise of honouring the surrender of cities and craft. He then followed {{the main body of the}} pirates to their strongholds on the coast of Cilicia, and destroyed them there in the naval Battle of Korakesion.|$|E
