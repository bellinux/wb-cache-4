50|$|The feedscrew (H8) {{is a long}} {{driveshaft}} {{that allows}} a series of gears to drive the carriage mechanisms. These gears {{are located in the}} apron of the carriage. Both the feedscrew and leadscrew (H7) are driven by either the change gears (on the quadrant) or an intermediate gearbox known as a quick change gearbox (H6) or Norton gearbox. These intermediate gears allow the correct ratio and direction to be set for cutting threads or worm <b>gears.</b> <b>Tumbler</b> <b>gears</b> (operated by H5) are provided between the spindle <b>and</b> <b>gear</b> train along with a quadrant plate that enables a gear train of the correct ratio and direction to be introduced. This provides a constant relationship between the number of turns the spindle makes, to the number of turns the leadscrew makes. This ratio allows screwthreads to be cut on the workpiece without the aid of a die.|$|R

50|$|He {{found that}} blind mice lacking classic outer-retinal photoreceptors (rods <b>and</b> <b>cones)</b> still had eye-mediated {{responses}} to light. Mice with the melanopsin gene knocked out but with functional rods <b>and</b> <b>cones</b> were {{also able to}} entrain. However, when melanopsin was knocked out in blind mice without rods <b>and</b> <b>cones,</b> they exhibited “complete loss of photoentrainment of the circadian oscillator, pupillary light responses, photic suppression of arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferase transcript, and acute suppression of locomotor activity by light.” Provencio concluded that either melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells or outer-retinal photoreceptors (rods <b>and</b> <b>cones)</b> are sufficient to induce a response to light. However, {{in the absence of}} either rods <b>and</b> <b>cones</b> or melanopsin, melanopsin becomes necessary for photoentrainment of the circadian oscillator and for other photic responses.|$|R
40|$|Rods <b>and</b> <b>cones</b> {{are both}} photoreceptors in the retina, {{but they are}} {{different}} in many aspects including the light response characteristics and, for example, cell morphology and metabolism. These differences would be caused by differences in proteins expressed in rods <b>and</b> <b>cones.</b> To understand the molecular bases of these differences between rods <b>and</b> <b>cones,</b> {{one of the ways}} is to compare proteins expressed in rods <b>and</b> <b>cones,</b> <b>and</b> to find those expressed specifically or dominantly. In the present study, we are interested in proteins in the outer segment (OS), the site responsible for generation of rod- or cone-characteristic light responses and also the site showing different morphology between rods <b>and</b> <b>cones.</b> For this, we established a method to purify the OS and the inner segment (IS) of rods <b>and</b> also of <b>cones</b> from purified carp rods <b>and</b> <b>cones,</b> respectively, using sucrose density gradient. In particular, we were interested in proteins tightly bound to the membranes of cone OS. To identify these proteins, we analyzed proteins in some selected regions of an SDS-gel of washed membranes of the OS and the IS obtained from both rods <b>and</b> <b>cones,</b> with Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a protein database constructed from carp retina. By comparing the lists of the proteins found in the OS and the IS of both rods <b>and</b> <b>cones,</b> we found some proteins present in cone OS membranes specifically or dominantly, in addition to the proteins already known to be present specifically in cone OS...|$|R
40|$|Rod <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> photoreceptors use {{similar but}} {{distinct}} sets of phototransduction proteins to achieve different functional properties, suitable for {{their role as}} dim and bright light receptors, respectively. For example, rod <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> visual pigments couple to distinct variants of the heterotrimeric G protein transducin. However, {{the role of the}} structural differences between rod <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> transducin α subunits (Tα) in determining the functional differences between rods <b>and</b> <b>cones</b> is unknown. To address this question, we studied the translocation and signaling properties of rod Tα expressed in <b>cones</b> <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> Tα expressed in rods in three mouse strains: rod Tα knockout, cone Tα GNAT 2 cpfl 3 mutant, <b>and</b> rod <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> Tα double mutant rd 17 mouse. Surprisingly, although the rod/cone Tα are only 79 % identical, exogenously expressed rod or <b>cone</b> Tα localized <b>and</b> translocated identically to endogenous Tα in each photoreceptor type. Moreover, exogenously expressed rod or cone Tα rescued electroretinogram responses (ERGs) in mice lacking functional cone or rod Tα, respectively. Ex vivo transretinal ERG and single-cell recordings from rd 17 retinas treated with rod or cone Tα showed comparable rod sensitivity and response kinetics. These results demonstrate that cone Tα forms a functional heterotrimeric G protein complex in rods and that rod <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> Tα couple equally well to the rod phototransduction cascade. Thus, rod <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> transducin α-subunits are functionally interchangeable and their signaling properties do not contribute to the intrinsic light sensitivity differences between rods <b>and</b> <b>cones.</b> Additionally, the technology used here could be adapted for any such homologue swap desired...|$|R

In light of the modal analysis, the transient dynamic finite element model of the <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> rack transmission system is established for the transient dynamic analysis. According to the equivalent stress contour of the <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> rack in contact progress at various times and based on transient dynamic analysis, contact strength and bending strength of the <b>gear</b> are verified <b>and</b> the maximum equivalent stress position is found, providing a theoretical basis for the optimization of the <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> rack...|$|R

40|$|Two {{types of}} photoreceptors, rods <b>and</b> <b>cones,</b> coexist in the {{vertebrate}} retina. An in-depth {{analysis of the}} retinal circuitry that transmits rod <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> signals has been hampered {{by the presence of}} intimate physical and functional connections between rod <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> pathways. By deleting the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel CNG 3 we have generated a mouse lacking any cone-mediated photoresponse. In contrast, the rod pathway is completely intact in CNG 3 -deficient mice. The functional loss of cone function correlates with a progressive degeneration of cone photoreceptors but not of other retinal cell types. CNG 3 -deficient mice provide an animal model to dissect unequivocally the contribution of rod <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> pathways for normal retinal function...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPENCEL Pressuremeter <b>and</b> <b>Cone</b> Penetrometer {{tests were}} {{performed}} at two sites chosen in Florida.

All correlations matched published values. From the PENCEL data excellent correlations were created between the initial elastic modulus and limit pressures.

40|$|Interactions between rod <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> {{signals in}} mudpuppy retinal neurones were {{investigated}} by intracellular recording. 2. The mudpuppy retina contains {{one kind of}} rod (lambda max = 525 nm) and one kind of cone (lambda max = 572 nm). The responses of receptors can be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their spectral sensitivities. 3. Rod <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> responses have different time courses of recovery and absolute sensitivities. Differences between receptor responses can be used to describe inputs to interneurones. 4. There are two spectral classes of horizontal cells: L-type and C-type. L-type cells are hyperpolarized by rods <b>and</b> <b>cones</b> in varying proportion, with some cells receiving little rod input. C-type cells are hyperpolarized by rods <b>and</b> depolarized by <b>cones.</b> 5. Bipolar cell receptive field centres receive input from cones or from rods <b>and</b> <b>cones.</b> There is no correlation between the spectral properties of centre responses and their polarity. 6. Antagonistic surrounds of bipolar cells show <b>cone</b> or rod <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> sensitivity. They are believed to be generated by the L-type horizontal cells. 7. Some bipolar cells exhibit chromatic interactions between cone signals in the centre and rod signals in the surround, which resemble those observed between the signals of different spectral classes of cones in species known to possess colour discrimination. 8. Amacrine and on-off ganglion cells have L-type responses showing both rod <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> sensitivity. 9. It is proposed that interactions between rod <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> signals observed in mudpuppy also exist in primate retina and are at least partially responsible for certain psychophysical observations of rod-cone interactions...|$|R
