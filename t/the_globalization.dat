40|$|The paper uses long-run GDP {{data for}} {{developed}} countries drawn from Maddison (2003) to generate deviation cycles {{for the period}} from 1870 to 2001. The cyclical deviates are examined for their bilateral cross-correlation values in three separate periods, those of <b>the</b> first <b>globalization</b> wave (1870 to 1914), {{the period of the}} "bloc economy" (1915 to 1959) and for the period of <b>the</b> second <b>globalization</b> (1960 - 2001). Cluster analysis is applied and the McNemar test is used to test for the relative coherence of alternative groupings of countries in the three periods. The bloc economy period emerges as one that features some well-defined sub-global clusters, where <b>the</b> second <b>globalization</b> period does not, <b>the</b> first <b>globalization</b> period lying between the two in this respect. <b>The</b> second <b>globalization</b> period shows a generally higher level of cross correlations and a lower variance than the other two periods.

We suggest that despite the potential of <b>the</b> anti-corporate <b>globalization</b> movement to usher in major social changes, the movement faces {{a number of major}} crossroads in terms of ideology, discursive approach, and overall strategy. We argue that there has been coalescence of a good many GSMs, including the international environmental movement, under the banner of <b>the</b> anti-corporate <b>globalization</b> movement. We focus primarily on the interrelations of these two GSMs, noting that over the past decade there have been trends toward both the environmentalization and de-environmentalization of <b>the</b> anti-corporate <b>globalization</b> movement. While <b>the</b> defection of many mainstream environmental groups fromthe Washington consensus and the resulting environmentalization of <b>the</b> trade and <b>globalization</b> issue were critical to the Seattle coalition, there has been a signi?cant decline in the movements embrace of environmental claims and discourses, and a corresponding increase in its use of social justice discourses. One implication of our analysis is the hypothesis that while the current vitality of <b>the</b> anti-corporate <b>globalization</b> movement can be gauged by its having adopted an increasingly coherent ideological stance in which international inequality and global corporate dominance are targeted, to be successful the movement will need to coherently ideologically integrate social justice with environmental and sustainability agendas. The amenability of the environmental GSM to such ideological integration will have important rami?cations for the future trajectory of <b>the</b> anti-corporate <b>globalization</b> movement...|$|R
