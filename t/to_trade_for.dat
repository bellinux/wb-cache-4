In June, the Cleveland Indians were {{reportedly}} attempting <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> <b>for</b> McLaughlin and teammate Larry Milbourne in exchange for Bo Díaz. However, nothing ever came of the deal. With Seattle that season, he went 3–6 with a 6.85 ERA, two saves, and 41 strikeouts in 45 games, four of which were starts. Over his four-year tenure with the Mariners, McLaughlin had a combined record of 14–21 with a 5.10 ERA, five complete games, 16 saves, and 203 strikeouts in 113 games. Of those games, he made 28 starts and finished 47.|$|E
5|$|Lucy Stone {{was born}} on August 13, 1818, on her family's farm at Coy's Hill in West Brookfield, Massachusetts. She was the eighth of nine {{children}} born to Hannah Matthews and Francis Stone; she grew up with three brothers and three sisters, two siblings having died before her own birth. Another member of the Stone household was Sarah Barr, “Aunt Sally” to the children– a sister of Francis Stone who had been abandoned by her husband and left dependent upon her brother. Although farm life was hard work for all and Francis Stone tightly managed the family resources, Lucy remembered her childhood as one of “opulence,” the farm producing all the food the family wanted and enough extra <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> <b>for</b> the few store-bought goods they needed.|$|E
50|$|This is {{typically}} illustrated in two ways. In a valuation paradigm, people {{will tend to}} pay more to retain something they own than to obtain something they do not own—even {{when there is no}} cause for attachment, or even if the item was only obtained minutes ago. In an exchange paradigm, people given a good are reluctant <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> it <b>for</b> another good of similar value. For example, participants first given a Swiss chocolate bar were generally unwilling <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> it <b>for</b> a coffee mug, whereas participants first given the coffee mug were generally unwilling <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> it <b>for</b> the chocolate bar.|$|R

5|$|The Giants did not draft {{a player}} in the first round on 11 occasions. Two of those picks, for the 1967 and 1968 drafts, were traded to the Minnesota Vikings in 1967 as part of a deal for quarterback Fran Tarkenton. During the 1974 season, the Giants dealt their 1975 first-round choice to the Dallas Cowboys for another quarterback, Craig Morton. In another case when the Giants used first-round draft picks <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> <b>for</b> a quarterback, the team {{acquired}} 2004 first overall pick Eli Manning from the San Diego Chargers, in a deal that included their 2004 and 2005 first-round picks; the Giants had already selected Philip Rivers with the 2004 pick, the fourth in that year's draft. The Giants used multiple first-round selections in 1951, 1972, and 1984; in the second instance; they gained a selection by trading Tarkenton back to the Vikings.|$|E

In 1531, Pedro de Alvarado finally took up the post of governor of Chiapa. He immediately reinstated the old name of San Cristóbal de los Llanos upon Villa Real. Once again, the encomiendas of Chiapa were transferred to new owners.

5|$|Before the 1988 San Diego Chargers season began, Dan Fouts {{chose to}} retire from the game after 15 seasons, leaving Vlasic as the main backup to starter Mark Herrmann, {{and as a result}} the Chargers began trying <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> <b>for</b> an {{experienced}} quarterback. The Chargers also signed Mark Malone and Babe Laufenberg to compete for the starting job, and traded Herrmann to the Indianapolis Colts. After months of training and the 1988 preseason, Vlasic began the season as the third-string quarterback behind Malone and Laufenberg, who won the starting job. In November, after Laufenberg was injured, the Chargers decided to make Vlasic the starter instead of Malone due to the latter's ineffectiveness, as well as a six-game losing streak. He made his season debut against the Atlanta Falcons on November 13, and threw for 190 yards in a 107 victory. As a result of his performance, coach Al Saunders said that Vlasic would have the starting job {{for the rest of the}} season. Vlasic's second start came against the Los Angeles Rams where he threw for 80 yards and a touchdown. However, he suffered torn ligaments in his left knee late in the third quarter, and was lost for the season. He finished the season with 25 of 52 passes completed and a passer rating of 54.2.|$|E
5|$|However, Claiborne {{was offered}} a {{position}} as a land surveyor in the new colony of Virginia, and arrived at Jamestown, {{on the north shore}} of the James River in 1621. The position carried a 200acre (80hectare) land grant, a salary of £30 per year, and the promise of fees paid by settlers who needed to have their land grants surveyed. His political acumen quickly {{made him one of the}} most successful Virginia colonists, and within four years of his arrival he had secured grants for 1,100acres (445hectares) of land and a retroactive salary of £60 a year from the Virginia Colony's council. He also managed to survive the March 1622 attacks by native/Indian Powhatans on the Virginia settlers that killed more than 300colonists. His financial success was followed by political success, and he gained appointment as Councilor in 1624 and Secretary of State for the Colony in 1626. Around 1627, he began <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> <b>for</b> furs with the native Susquehannock Indians from further north on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay and two of its largest tributaries, the Potomac and Susquehanna Rivers. To facilitate this trade, Claiborne wanted to establish a trading post on Kent Island in the mid-way of the Chesapeake Bay, which he intended to make the center of a vast mercantile empire along the Atlantic Coast. Claiborne found both financial and political support for the Kent Island venture from London merchants Maurice Thomson, William Cloberry, John de la Barre, and Simon Turgis.|$|E

The Mazariegos family managed to establish a power base in the local colonial institutions and, in 1535, they succeeded in having San Cristóbal de los Llanos declared a city, with the new name of Ciudad Real. They also managed to acquire special privileges from the Crown in order to stabilise the colony, such as an edict that specified that the governor of Chiapa must govern in person and not through a delegated representative. In practise, the quick turnover of encomiendas continued, since few Spaniards had legal Spanish wives and legitimate children who could inherit. This situation would not stabilise until the 1540s, when the dire shortage of Spanish women in the colony was alleviated by an influx of new colonists.|$|E
