40|$|A channel rebate is {{a payment}} from a {{manufacturer}} to a retailer based on retailer sales to end consumers. Two common forms of channel rebates are linear rebates, {{in which the}} rebate is paid for each unit sold, and target rebates, in which the rebate is paid for each unit sold beyond a specified target level. When demand is not influenced by sales effort, a properly designed <b>target</b> <b>rebate</b> achieves channel coordination and a win-win outcome. Coordination cannot be achieved by a linear rebate {{in a way that}} is implementable. When demand is influenced by retailer sales effort, a properly designed <b>target</b> <b>rebate</b> and returns contract achieves coordination and a win-win outcome. Other contracts, such as linear rebate and returns or <b>target</b> <b>rebate</b> alone, cannot achieve coordination {{in a way that is}} implementable. Contrary to the view expressed in the literature that accepting returns weakens incentives for retailer sales effort, we find that the provision of returns strengthens incentives for effort. channel coordination, supply chain management, incentives, rebates, sales effort...|$|E
40|$|False failure {{returns are}} {{products}} that are returned by consumers to retailers with no functional cosmetic defect. The cost of a false failure return includes the processing actions of testing, refurbishing if necessary, repackaging, the loss in value during the time the product spends in reverse supply chain (a time that can exceed several months for many firms), and the loss in revenue because the product is sold at a discounted price. This cost is significant, and is incurred primarily by the manufacturer. Reducing false failure returns, however, requires effort primarily by the retailer, for example informing consumers about the exact product that best fits their needs. We {{address the problem of}} reducing false failure returns via supply chain coordination methods. Specifically, we propose a <b>target</b> <b>rebate</b> contract that pays the retailer a specific dollar amount per each unit of false failure returns below a target. This <b>target</b> <b>rebate</b> provides an incentive to the retailer to increase her effort, thus decreasing the number of false failures and (potentially) increasing net sales. We show that this contract is Pareto–improving in the majority of cases. Our results also indicate that the profit improvement to both parties, and the supply chain, is substantial...|$|E

40|$|In Chapter II we {{investigate}} consumer behavior when facing <b>target</b> <b>rebates,</b> a rebate practice challenged by antitrust law. In three experiments, we confirm the hypothesis derived from Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), that <b>target</b> <b>rebates</b> {{are likely to}} create psychological switching costs that can make <b>target</b> <b>rebates</b> a tool dominant firms can use to inefficiently foreclose markets. In an experiment reported in Chapter III I confirm that guilt aversion, i. e., a preference to fulfill other people’s expectations, plays out stronger if agents are socially close. The hypothesis was triggered by legal intuition but can also be derived from psychological theory and seems to structure the previous literature on guilt aversion well. The cautious ingroup-outgroup manipulation that generates the result makes allows the presumption that the effect is way stronger in the field where relationships rest on friendship, family ties or co-workership. In Chapter IV we study how intra-team conflict and knowledge thereof influence inter-team competition. We model intra-team conflict (hereafter: “conflict”) by connecting a team’s pricing decision to the intra-team profit division. Inter-team competition is modeled as a Bertrand duopoly with homogeneous goods. We vary market composition (two conflict-teams, one conflict-team and one no-conflict-team, two no-conflict teams) {{and the availability of}} information regarding conflict of the other team (hereafter: “information”). We find that (1) prices are higher in homogenous markets of conflict-teams than in homogeneous markets of no-conflict teams. (2) With information, prices in heterogeneous markets are as low as in homogenous markets of no-conflict teams. (3) Without information on the other team’s conflict, prices in heterogeneous markets are as high as in homogenous markets of conflict-teams. (4) Information on the other team’s conflict leads to higher prices in homogeneous markets but to lower prices in heterogeneous markets...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{whether and how}} targeted rebates impede rational switching of consumers from an incumbent to an outside option (e. g., market entrant). In a real trading problem, participants repeatedly buy tokens and can enter a <b>target</b> <b>rebate</b> scheme. Buying in a rebate scheme considerably reduces the likelihood that they switch to a higher-payoff outside option later. We conclude that targeted rebates might have an underestimated potential to foreclose consumer markets.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 64 - 67. In this study, {{the coordination}} of a manufacturer and a retailer in a supply chain is considered, in a single period environment where the manufacturer has carbon emission restriction with trade option. The customer demand over a period {{is assumed to be}} a random variable with an arbitrary distribution. Two types of contracts, namely the buyback and the <b>target</b> <b>rebate</b> contracts are considered. For each type, the contract parameters which achieve channel coordination have been studied. The models show that for both contract types, under specific parameter settings coordination is achievable. In particular, we show that under a buyback contract with a carbon trader manufacturer, coordination can be achieved, even if no returns are allowed, contrary to the findings of Pasternack, who first studied a buyback contract in a setting where carbon emissions are not taken into consideration. The results are illustrated by numerical examples. Ebadi, MalekM. S...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} factors that {{contribute}} to the difficulties in managing a supply chain is high demand uncertainty. This presents a challenge especially when products of interest have short life cycles. In such environments and assuming that an accurate demand estimate can be obtained, {{it has been shown that}} a delay in making an order commitment benefits both the manufacturer and the retailer. In this study, a retailer uses an information gathering process for updating demand estimates in a Bayesian framework, and estimation accuracy improves as more information is continuously accumulated. We also consider a manufacturer having a finite regular capacity with the availability of a fixed overtime capacity. As part of the study, we develop the properties of an optimal production allocation between regular and overtime capacity. Furthermore, we propose production lead time dependent quantity discount pricing arrangements between the manufacturer and the retailer that allows both of them to take advantage of more accurate demand estimates and accounts for the availability of overtime capacity. We also construct a <b>target</b> <b>rebate</b> and returns contract that achieves win-win coordination in such an integrated system of information and production flexibility. ...|$|E
40|$|Regulators {{often use}} {{conservation}} <b>targeting</b> <b>rebate</b> programs to promote energy conservation. Consumers participating in such programs receive a financial reward if they achieve a targeted level of conservation. The e↵ectiveness of the programs, however, remains highly controversial because non-experimental data rarely provide reliable {{estimates of the}} treatment e↵ect. This study examines the cost-e↵ectiveness of conservation rebate programs by using a regression discontinuity design in the California 20 / 20 rebate program. In 2005, California residents received a 20 % discount on their summer electricity bills if they saved electricity by 20 % relative to their consumption in 2004. The program’s enrollment scheme prevented self-selection and created a discontinuity of treatment status. Using household-level monthly billing records from the three largest California electric utilities, I find heterogeneous responses to the rebate incentive. In the areas where summer temperature is persistently high and income-level is relatively low, the incentive reduced electricity consumption by 5 % to 10 %. In the other areas, however, the treatment e↵ect is essentially zero. I show that the cost-e↵ectiveness is very poor in these areas because many consumer...|$|R

A composite contract based on the quantity-restricted returns and <b>target</b> sales <b>rebate</b> can achieve coordination in this setting. Two main problems are addressed: (1) how to coordinate the decentralized supply chain; (2) how to determine the optimal sales effort level, pricing, and inventory decisions under the additive demand case. Numerical examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of combined contract in supply chain coordination and highlight model sensitivities to parametric changes...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Many supply {{contracts}} {{are employed in}} practice to improve the performance of supply chains. But {{there is a lack}} of research that can offer guidance to practitioners in choosing the best supply contract among a group of popular contracts. This paper aims to fill this gap by developing an intelligent rule-based supply contract design system for choosing the best contract and its parameters from a supplier's point of view. Design/methodology/approach – The approach used in this paper is based on the comparison of several {{supply contracts}} that are encountered in supply chain practice. The paper aims at identifying the conditions under which one supply contract outperforms another from the supplier's perspective. To facilitate the implementation of the decision-making rules that are developed in this research, an intelligent decision support system is developed. Findings – Six popular contracts are analysed; returns policy (RP), quantity discount (QD), <b>target</b> <b>rebate</b> (TR), backup agreement (BA), quantity flexibility (QF), and quantity commitment (QC). The main findings are: QD contracts generate larger expected profits for the supplier than TR contracts do when the demand is exogenous, an RP contract is better than a QD contract when the wholesale profit margin is sufficiently large and that the optimal QC contract always provides a higher expected service level than BA and QF contracts. Originality/value – The paper presents an approach for developing an intelligent supply contract design system that can offer guidance to practitioners in choosing the best supply contract for a particular supplier...|$|E

40|$|We explore in {{this paper}} the {{performance}} of sales rebate contracts in fashion supply chains. We conduct both analytical and numerical analyses via a mean-variance framework with reference to real empirical data. To be specific, we evaluate the expected profits and variance of profits (risk) of the fashion supply chains, fashion retailers, and manufacturers under (1) the currently implemented sales rebate practices, (2) the case without sales rebate, and (3) the theoretical coordination situation (if <b>target</b> sales <b>rebate</b> is adopted). In addition, we analyze how sales effort affects the performances of the supply chain and its agents. Our analysis indicates that the rebate contracts may hurt the retailer and the manufacturer of a fashion supply chain when it is inappropriately set. Moreover, a properly designed sales rebate contract not only can coordinate the supply chain (with retail sales effort) but can also improve expected profits and lower the levels of risk for both the manufacturer and the retailer.

40|$|<b>Target</b> sales <b>rebate</b> (TSR) {{contracts}} {{have been}} shown to be useful in coordinating supply chains with risk-neutral agents. However, there have been few studies on the cases with risk sensitive agents. As a result, based on the classic Markowitz portfolio theory in finance, we carry out in this paper a meanvariance (MV) analysis of supply chains under TSR contracts. We study a supply chain with a single supplier and a single risk averse retailer. We propose TSR contracts for achieving coordination. We demonstrate how TSR contracts can coordinate the supply chain which takes into consideration the degree of risk aversion of the retailer. We find that the supplier can coordinate the channel with flexible TSR contracts. In addition, we extend the supply chain model to include sales effort decision of the retailer. Conditions for TSR contracts to coordinate the supply chain with sales effort of retailer are also derived. Department of Applied MathematicsInstitute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|Many {{countries}} use substantial {{public funds}} to subsidize reductions in negative externalities. However, such subsidies create asymmetric incentives because increases in externalities remain unpriced. This paper examines implications of such asymmetric subsidy incentives {{by using a}} regression discontinuity design in California’s electricity rebate program that provided a financial reward for energy conservation. Using household-level panel data from administrative records, I find precisely-estimated zero causal effects in coastal areas. In contrast, the incentive produced a 5 % consumption reduction in inland areas. Income and climate conditions significantly drive the heterogeneity. Asymmetric subsidy structures weaken incentives because consumers far from the <b>rebate</b> <b>target</b> show little response.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} {{the increase in}} the market share of ENERGY STAR-qualified appliances that can be attributed to <b>targetted</b> cash <b>rebates</b> offered by utility companies. To estimate the impact of these incentives we use the variation in timing and size of the utility rebates across the US states. We then use these estimates along with information on the average energy saved by using an ENERGY STAR appliance relative to a non-ENERGY STAR appliance to provide an estimate on the cost per tonne of carbon saved by the rebate program. Our results show that a dollar increase in the rebate leads to a 0. 3 % increase in the share of ENERGY STAR-qualified clothes washers while the effect of rebates is not significant for dishwashers and refrigerators. Assuming a redemption rate of 40 %, we calculate the cost of saving a tonne of carbon through the clothes washer rebate program to be around $ 158. The corresponding cost of a megawatt hour saved (about $ 32), is lower than the estimated cost of building and operating an additional power plant and the average on-peak spot price. We conclude that the ENERGY STAR clothes washers rebate programs are a cost-effective way for utilities to reduce energy demand.

40|$|We {{consider}} the coordination challenge with a risk-neutral manufacturer which supplies to multiple heterogeneou retailers. We {{find that the}} manufacturer can maximize its expected profit only if the expected profit of the supply chain is maximized, or equivalently supply chain coordination (SCC) is achieved. The <b>target</b> sales <b>rebate</b> (TSR) contract is commonly used in practice to achieve SCC. However, as we found in this paper, the presence of heterogeneity in retailers' minimum expected profit requirements is the major cause that a single TSR contract and the related single hybrid contracts all fail to achieve SCC and maximize the manufacturer's expected profit simultaneously. Thus, we develop an innovative menu of TSR contracts with fixed order quantity (TSR-FOQ). Although there are multiple contracts in a menu, {{we find that the}} manufacturer only needs to decide one basic TSR contract and two newly developed parameters termed as the risk-level indicator and the separation indicator, in applying the sophisticated menu of TSR-FOQ. By adjusting the two indicators, the manufacturer can control the profit variance of the retailers and the separations of the component contracts of the menu. We further propose another sophisticated menu of TSR with minimum order quantity and quantity discount contracts which can give each retailer a higher degree of freedom in the selection of order quantity. Differences between the two menus are analytically examined. Some meaningful managerial insights are generated. Department of Applied MathematicsInstitute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
