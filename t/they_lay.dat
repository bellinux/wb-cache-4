5|$|Menzies' seed {{specimens}} {{were sent}} to England from Sydney in 1793, but his plant material remained {{with him for the}} duration of the voyage, during which some material was lost. On his return to England in 1795, the surviving specimens were deposited into the herbarium of Sir Joseph Banks, where <b>they</b> <b>lay</b> undescribed for many years.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} known monotremes was Teinolophos, which lived about 120 million years ago in Australia. Monotremes have some features which may be inherited from the original amniotes such as the same orifice to urinate, defecate and reproduce (cloaca) – as lizards and birds also do – and <b>they</b> <b>lay</b> eggs which are leathery and uncalcified.|$|E

5|$|The first {{poultry breed}} {{to have its}} own {{specialist}} club for enthusiasts, Sebrights were admitted to poultry exhibition standards not long after their establishment. Today, they are among the most popular of bantam breeds. Despite their popularity, Sebrights are often difficult to breed, and the inheritance of certain unique characteristics the breed carries has been studied scientifically. As a largely ornamental chicken, <b>they</b> <b>lay</b> tiny, white eggs and are not kept for meat production.|$|E
5|$|The main {{spawning}} season for bigfin reef squids usually begins in May, but <b>they</b> <b>lay</b> eggs {{all year round}} and {{spawning season}}s can vary by location. A single female can spawn {{more than once in}} her lifetime. Females can release 20 to 1180 eggs per individual and will die soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|His {{funeral was}} {{one of the largest in}} the South. Davis was first entombed at the Army of Northern Virginia tomb at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans. In 1893, Mrs. Davis decided to have his remains reinterred at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. After the remains were exhumed in New Orleans, <b>they</b> <b>lay</b> for a day at Memorial Hall of the newly {{organized}} Louisiana Historical Association, with many mourners passing by the casket, including Governor Murphy J. Foster, Sr. The body was placed on a Louisville and Nashville Railroad car and transported to Richmond, Virginia. A continuous cortège, day and night, accompanied his body from New Orleans to Richmond. He is interred at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.|$|E

5|$|Some British sources {{claim that}} the Polish cavalrymen refused to accept any {{surrender}} by the British infantry, and deliberately speared the wounded as <b>they</b> <b>lay.</b> Tradition reports that the British 2nd Division swore to give no quarter to Poles following Albuera. According to Beresford, of the 1,258 men lost by Colborne's first three regiments, 319 were killed, 460 were wounded and 479 were taken prisoner. According to Soult's report the Vistula Lancers had 130 casualties out of 591 troopers.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} Warwick and Montagu {{were laid out}} 'on the morrow after' and 'openly shewed and naked' in St. Paul's, to prevent rumour {{starting}} that they had in fact survived the battle; Warkworth too said that the King personally directed this, and arranged for the corpses 'to {{be put in a}} cart... to be laid in the church of Paul's, on the pavement, that every man might see them; and so <b>they</b> <b>lay</b> for three or four days' before granting permission to their brother George for their burial at Bisham Priory.|$|E
5|$|At 02:00 on 15 April Océan {{finally began}} to move again, {{reaching}} safety upriver by 03:30. Several other ships were exposed, but without a bomb vessel <b>they</b> <b>lay</b> beyond {{the range of the}} British fleet. The French sailors made significant efforts to retrieve these ships over the following days; on 16 April Indienne was deemed too damaged to be saved, abandoned, and set on fire. The frigate exploded at midday. The following day Foudroyant and Tourville reached safety, and only Régulus now remained vulnerable. For several days in severe gales and heavy rain the ship remained stranded in the mud while Wolfe worked to bring up newly arrived replacement bomb vessel HMS Thunder. An attack on 20 April failed after the gun spilt almost immediately, and a larger scale attack with both bomb vessels and smaller ships failed on 24 April. No further attempts were made to destroy Régulus, and on 29 April the ship was finally refloated and brought to safety in the Charente. On the same day Gambier finally abandoned his blockade of the river and sailed his fleet for England.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for League One football, Adams signed winger Kaid Mohamed {{to replace the}} departing Ashley Vincent. He also signed defenders Chris Robertson and Carl Dickinson, midfielders Chris Lines and Anthony Griffith, and forward Gavin Tomlin. On 22 September, Rob Page was put in temporary charge of first team affairs at Vale Park after Adams took the decision {{to take time off}} work to have hip replacement surgery. The club overstretched itself financially, meaning that as <b>they</b> <b>lay</b> outside the play-offs in January Adams could only sign largely untried youngsters on loan whilst releasing higher paid players either on free transfers or on loan. Their promotion push fell away but they ended the season in ninth place – far exceeding their original aim of avoiding relegation. During this time he had to deal with issues such as sacking defender Daniel Jones for physically attacking captain Doug Loft during training, and had to deal with months of speculation over his own future after chairman Norman Smurthwaite took until May before offering him a new one-year rolling contract. He signed the contract the following month.|$|E
5|$|Lacaille charted and {{designated}} ten {{stars with}} the Bayer designations Alpha through to Kappa in 1756. He catalogued stars that became Lambda and Mu {{but did not}} designate them as he considered them informes as <b>they</b> <b>lay</b> outside the asterism proper. Baily considered them part of Musca, and Gould gave them their Bayer designations. Francis Baily also dropped Kappa, which he felt was too faint to warrant a name, and designated two adjacent stars as Zeta1 and Zeta2. These last two stars are 1° apart, quite far to be sharing a Bayer designation. Lacaille had originally labelled the fainter one as Zeta, while Baily presupposed he'd meant to label the brighter one. Reluctant to remove Lacaille's designation, he gave them both the Zeta designation. Altogether there are 62 stars brighter than magnitude 6.5 in the constellation.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{began moving}} troops to Brooklyn in early May, {{and there were}} several {{thousand}} of them there in a short time. Three more forts were under construction {{on the eastern side}} of the East River to support Fort Stirling, which stood to the west of the hamlet of Brooklyn Heights. These new fortifications were Fort Putnam (named for Rufus Putnam and not to be confused with the later Fort Putnam at West Point), Fort Greene (named for Nathanael Greene), and Fort Box (named for Major Daniel Box). <b>They</b> <b>lay</b> from north to south, with Fort Putnam farthest to the north, Greene slightly to the southwest, and Box slightly farther southwest. Each of these defensive structures was surrounded by a large ditch, all connected by a line of entrenchments and a total of 36 cannons (mostly 18-pounders).|$|E

5|$|In 2013, {{the video}} {{distribution}} company The Criterion Collection, {{in collaboration with}} the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ Film Archive, began the restoration of the original negatives of the Apu trilogy, including Pather Panchali. These negatives had been severely damaged by a fire in London in 1993, and all film cans and fragments belonging to the Ray films were sent to the Motion Picture Academy for storage, where <b>they</b> <b>lay</b> unseen for two decades. It was discovered upon reexamination that, although many parts of the films were indeed destroyed by fire or the effects of age, other parts were salvageable. The materials were shipped to a restoration laboratory in Bologna, Italy: L’Immagine Ritrovata. Over a thousand hours of labor by hand were expended in restoring and scanning the negatives and, in the end, about 40 percent of the Pather Panchali negative was restored. (For those parts of the negative that were missing or unusable, duplicate negatives and fine-grain masters from various commercial or archival sources were used.) The Criterion Collection’s own lab then spent six months creating the digital version of all three films, at times choosing to preserve the distinctive look of the films even at the cost of retaining some imperfections.|$|E

25|$|Imagines {{probably}} {{live for}} 5–10 days. Males are active on warm sunny days. Females mate once shortly after emerging; <b>they</b> <b>lay</b> their eggs only during warm weather, {{spending most of}} the time either basking or hiding in vegetation.|$|E
25|$|Limacina helicina is a protandric hermaphrodite. Males are smaller, at {{sizes of}} 4–5mm {{and then they}} change to females, which are larger than 5mm.
