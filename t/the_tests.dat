5|$|Bradman rotated {{the three}} openers {{in the tour}} matches, but Morris and Barnes were {{preferred}} in <b>the</b> <b>Tests.</b> Bradman accommodated Brown in his first-choice team by playing him out of position in the middle order in <b>the</b> <b>Tests.</b> However, Brown appeared uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role, and was dropped after making 73 runs at a batting average of 24.33 {{in the first two}} Tests.|$|E

Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier were contractors hired to design and install the timing and firing systems. Seven experimental weapon assemblies and six cores were delivered to San Pedro, California, and loaded on the weapon assembly ship USS Curtiss, in February 1948, but the Atomic Energy Commission only gave permission for the expenditure of three cores in <b>the</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|E

5|$|Further {{testing of}} Silverplate B-29 {{aircraft}} and Thin Man and Fat Man bomb shapes {{was carried out}} at Muroc Army Air Field in March and June 1944. Testing shifted to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, in October. Project Y controlled the scheduling and contents of <b>the</b> <b>tests,</b> which were {{carried out by the}} Flight Test Section of the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit as Project W-47. <b>The</b> <b>tests</b> were supervised by Ramsey until November, when Commander Frederick Ashworth became Parson's head of operations, and assumed responsibility for the test program. The test bombs were assembled by the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit's Special Ordnance Detachment. Tests continued {{until the end of the}} war in August 1945. At first only the Ordnance Division's fuse and delivery groups were involved, but as <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> became more detailed, and live explosives were incorporated into the test bombs, other groups were drawn into the test program.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>test</b> {{was nearly}} universally {{condemned}} {{by the international}} community. Following <b>the</b> <b>test,</b> <b>the</b> United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1874 condemning <b>the</b> <b>test</b> and tightening sanctions on the country.|$|R

5|$|Harvey {{started the}} tour well and was highly {{productive}} in seven first-class matches leading into <b>the</b> <b>Tests.</b> He scored 100 and 145 not out against North Eastern Transvaal and Orange Free State. There were two matches against a South African XI that were effectively dress rehearsals for <b>the</b> <b>Tests.</b> In the first, Harvey made 34 in an innings victory. He then made an even 100 {{in the second}} match, {{a week before the}} First Test. He had scored 480 runs at 60.00 in the matches leading up to <b>the</b> <b>Tests.</b>|$|E

5|$|He {{broke through}} {{for his first}} five-wicket haul on English soil in his fifth match against Glamorgan, taking 5/63 in the first innings and scoring an unbeaten 68.

5|$|In all {{first-class}} matches, he took 86wickets at 15.68 {{and held}} onto 14 catches, fielding in the slips. There were many consecutive matches during the tour with no rest day in between, so Bradman ensured Miller and Lindwall remained fresh {{for the new}} ball bursts in <b>the</b> <b>Tests</b> by giving them a lighter workload during the tour matches. During all first-class matches, Johnston bowled 851.1 overs, Johnson 668, Lindwall 573.4, Toshack 502, while Miller bowled only 429.4 overs. Outside <b>the</b> <b>Tests,</b> Lindwall bowled 349.3 overs, only the fifth heaviest workload among the Australians in those matches.|$|E
