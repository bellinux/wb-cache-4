40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the legal regulation of an agency contract {{according to the}} Act no. 89 / 2012 Coll., The Civil Code, with {{the focus on the}} general description of the terms and institutes of agency contract. The work is divided into five chapters, the main objective {{of this paper is to}} describe the basic definition of an agency contract. The first chapter described and analyzed the basic characteristics of an agency contract, especially the agent himself, the long-term perception of the agency contract, the definition of the term certain types of transactions, and we have discussed a exclusive and non-exclusive agency contract. The second chapter is focused on the rights and obligations of the parties of the agency contract with a closer focus on the issue of commissions. In chapters 3, 4 and 5, we discussed <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> contract, anticompetitive clause and we also mentioned Švarcsystem. Some chapters are for clarity divided into subchapters and the names of the subchapters signify the topic that subchapter is dedicated to. The thesis also refers to the commentary literature and case law relating to legal framework contained in the Act no. 513 / 1991 Coll., The Commercial Code. In the end the conclusion is drawn about whether the stated objectives have been achieved. Title: Agency Contract [...] ...|$|E

Ltd. In that year the company's business amounted to about 3 million tons, out of a total UK market of some 7 million tons.The activities of this most successful enterprise have extended greatly over the years. In 1970 Shell-Mex and B.P. Ltd. supplied 40 million tons of the UK petroleum market, amounting to a total of 100 million tons.In the majority of countries outside the UK. Shell and BP have always each marketed their products through their own entirely separate organisations and it has been decided that Shell and BP marketing operations in the UK should now be brought more into line with this pattern over the next 4-5 years.Since 1966 the Shell and the BP Service Station networks have been managed by separate sales organisations within Shell-Mex and B.P. It is now proposed to extend this 'brand streaming' progressively to cover all products and all market sectors. This will ultimately lead to the establishment of two viable marketing organisations within Shell-Mex and B.P. thus facilitating the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>agency</b> agreement.The National Benzole Company will continue to trade under the National brand and will form part of the BP marketing organisation.The Supply, Storage and Delivery functions, and the Computer and other services, will be the object of further detailed study once brand streaming of direct trade is substantially complete and a plan for the treatment of Authorised Distributors is agreed. Should it be decided that these functions should continue for a period after the transfer of the sales activities, then these will continue to be carried out by Shell-Mex and B.P.The employees of Shell-Mex and B.P. will be redeployed within the separate marketing organisations and redundancies will not arise {{as a result of this}} re-organisation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Innermost {{context-sensitive}} rewriting {{has been}} proved useful for modeling computations of programs of algebraic languages like Maude, OBJ, etc. Furthermore, innermost <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> rewriting is often easier to prove than termination.
