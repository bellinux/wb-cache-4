5|$|This {{new system}} allowed rural {{residents}} to migrate, {{it did not}} allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> their residence or accept any benefits in the cities. This resulted in a growing population of migrant laborers without the minimal benefits of residency including medical care, housing, or education. Many migrant women do not trust the government to protect their rights. Today, up to 90% of migrants work without contracts, {{in violation of the}} Chinese labour law.|$|E

There were immediate allegations that he had engineered his election through manipulation of the hall's board of directors and by telling <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the rules for selection. Two lawyers, hired by the league to lead an investigation, recommended that Stein's selection be overturned, although it was soon revealed that Stein had previously decided to turn down the induction.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his scenes, Rupert Graves was tanned {{because before}} filming the episode, the actor was in Guadeloupe, an island on the Caribbean, {{appearing}} in Death in Paradise. As a result, Gatiss added mention that Lestrade went on holiday in the script. In the original episode, John was to hallucinate the hound at a meat storage locker. However, after visiting such a locker in Bristol, the producers came to realise {{that it would}} be too expensive, and cold for Freeman, forcing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the setting to the Baskerville labs. In one scene, Sherlock is driving a Land Rover with John as a passenger after their arrival at Dartmoor; John was originally {{going to be the one}} driving the car, however Freeman cannot drive. In the client scenes, Tovey had to smoke a herbal cigarette as it was illegal to smoke real cigarettes on set. Throughout the episode, the production crew used split dioptres in certain scenes, a camera technique where two separate camera angles are at the same focus on screen. The episode also includes shots of the hound, which was produced by visual effects. Although the series used computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the past, it was the first time a visual effect was made on a large scale. However, there was no guide for the cast to interact with.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} factor dominating the river history in Bengal is the large proportion of silt carried by its rivers.

Silt deposited in the old river channel beds has forced <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> course, creating problems for abandoned areas while assisting in developing new areas.|$|E

Sage's hair would change from red to black, or later to a darker red. Sage's treated clothing would change to light blue and orange, or later to dark blue. Some later {{versions of the}} gas caused no color change whatsoever. The faceless mask, combined with the color change of clothing, was sufficient to disguise Sage's identity to most onlookers. All of Sage's clothing was similarly treated. Originally Sage favored trench coats, business suits, and fedoras. Later he expanded his treated wardrobe, giving him a less standardized look.|$|E

25|$|The six men {{decided to}} form their own {{fraternity}} along with William Lewis Lockwood, a student from New York who had not joined a fraternity. On June 28, 1855, the organization was founded under the name Sigma Phi Fraternity. Lockwood used his business training to help organize the fraternity in its early years. The eventual theft of Sigma Phi's constitution, rituals, seals, and other records from Lockwood's room in Oxford in January 1856 prompted <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> {{the name of the}} fraternity to Sigma Chi. It is possible this action could have been forced upon the group as there was already a Sigma Phi Society.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} in Halbe was desperate for the Germans. Orders {{were still being}} issued to recognisable formations, but these were by now all mixed up. There was considerable tension between the Waffen-SS and Wehrmacht troops, with both accusing the other of helping their own while ignoring {{the plight of the}} other. In Halbe itself, some of the civilians took pity on very young soldiers ("Kindersoldaten") and allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> out of their uniforms into civilian clothes. In one documented case, an SS man appeared at the door of a cellar intending to shoot a Panzerfaust into a cellar with about 40 civilians and young Wehrmacht soldiers in it, only to be shot dead by one of the soldiers.|$|E

In this story, Titus and Gisippus are inseparable until Gisippus falls in love with Sophronia. He introduces her to Titus, but Titus is overcome with jealousy, and vows to seduce her. Upon hearing of Titus' plan, Gisippus arranges for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> places on the wedding night, thus placing their friendship above his love.|$|E

However, he also encouraged African Americans (Bilalians) to separate themselves from their pasts, in 1976 calling upon <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> their surnames which were often given to their ancestors by slave masters. He forged closer ties with mainstream Muslim communities, including Latinos. He also decentralized power.
