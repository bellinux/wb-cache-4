40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in engaging citizen scientists {{in the collection of}} environmental data to inform conservation efforts and decision making, and to augment formal monitoring programmes. Citizen scientists can collect data across large spatial and temporal scales that cannot be feasibly covered through traditional research and monitoring programmes. The 'Porcupine Ray Hunt' was a pilot study that engaged the Australian recreational SCUBA diving community in collecting information on the porcupine ray Urogymnus asperrimus, an easily identifiable but rare and poorly understood species. 'Crowd sourcing' of recreational divers was achieved by advertising the programme through diving publications, the internet, e-mail lists and social media (facebook and blogs). Dive clubs, dive shops and research stations also advertised the project. Recreational divers were required <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> photographs and <b>observations</b> for verification and 29 new valid records were received. Submissions also included video footage of foraging and mating behaviour. The submissions received doubled the number of existing records on the species in Australia, identified distribution 'hot spots', provided a depth range for the species and extended the species' range.

40|$|Abstract – Periodontitis is {{a public}} health issue, {{being one of the}} most {{prevalent}} diseases worldwide. However, the aetiology of the disease is still unclear: genetics of patients cannot explain the dispersed or isolated localisation of gin-gival pockets, while bacteria-based models are insufficient to distinguish gingivitis and periodontitis. The possible role of parasites in the establishment of periodontitis has been poorly studied until now. The aim of this project was to study a potential link between colonisation of gingival crevices by the amoeba Entamoeba gingivalis and periodontitis. In eight different dental clinics in France, samples were taken in periodontal pockets (72) or healthy sites (33), and <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> microscopic <b>observation</b> and molecular identification by PCR with a new set of primers designed to spe-cifically detect E. gingivalis. This blind sample analysis showed the strong sensitivity of PCR compared with clinical diagnosis (58 / 72 = 81 %), and microscopy (51 / 65 = 78 %). The results of this work show that the parasites detected by microscopy mainly – if not exclusively – belong to the species E. gingivalis and that the presence of the parasite is correlated with periodontitis...|$|R

This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the ingestive behavior of sheep fed increasing levels of mesquite pod meal (0, 15, 30 and 45 % in total dry matter diet), replacing grass silage elephant.

The sheep were <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> visual <b>observation</b> every ten minutes, for 24 hours, in the 13 th day of each experimental period. There was no significant regression (p> 0. 05) relative to the time spent on feeding, rumination and resting, depending on the levels of substitution of mesquite pod meal. The average time spent on feeding, rumination and resting was 5. 64, 10. 88 and 8. 8 h day- 1, respectively. There was a positive linear effect (p < 0. 05) regarding the levels of replacement of elephant grass silage by mesquite pod meal on dry matter intake (DMI), neutral detergent fiber intake (NDFI), feeding efficiency of DM, rumination efficiency of DM, rumination efficiency of NDF.

40|$|Objective: It was {{the aim of}} {{this study}} to assess the role, {{feasibility}} and safety of consolidation intraperitoneal (IP) paclitaxel in patients affected by advanced ovarian cancer. Methods: Patients affected by advanced ovarian cancer with complete pathological response after standard treatment were enrolled in this study. The consolidation chemotherapy schedule consisted of 12 - 16 cycles of IP paclitaxel, 60 mg/mq weekly (group A). Chemotherapy was delivered with a direct puncture under ultrasonographic guidance at each cycle. Survival data of this group of patients were compared with those from a control group with analogous characteristics <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>observation</b> only (group B). Results: Seventy patients were included in the study, 28 in group A and 42 in group B. Treatment-related toxicity was mild. In 3 / 28 patients (11 %), technical difficulties in accessing the peritoneum were observed. Median time to recurrence was 25 months (range 4 - 64) in group A and 17. 5 months (range 2 - 60) in group B. Estimated 3 -year disease-free survival was 56 and 33 % (p < 0. 05) in group A and B, respectively; no significant difference in 3 -year overall survival was observed (87 vs. 83 %; p value not significant). Conclusion: Weekly IP consolidation chemotherapy with paclitaxel 60 mg/mq is well tolerated and, in this experience, a prolongation of progression-free survival was observed. Copyright © 2010 S.

Although response rates per se {{may be associated with}} survival prolongation, patients experiencing objective response may be those patients fated to have the longest natural disease history. The separation of responders from progressing patients after first-line chemotherapy could allow the selection of a more homogeneous subgroup in which further treatment strategies might achieve a better control of the disease. This study investigated the influence of some patient characteristics, disease characteristics, and previous treatments on the outcome of non progressing patients after first-line chemotherapy with epirubicin administration. We also evaluated the effect of the maintenance endocrine therapy in improving response rate and overall survival (OS). From May 91 to May 93, 207 patients were enrolled in a randomized trial aiming to compare the activity of epirubicin (120 mg/sqm) +/- lonidamine (600 mg/daily). Among the 169 patients attaining complete (CR), partial response (PR) or disease stabilization (SD), 65 were not randomly <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> maintenance endocrine therapy (MET). Liver involvement, previous adjuvant chemotherapy and previous hormonal therapy (administered in adjuvant setting or for advanced disease) were found to negatively influence OS both in univariate and multivariate analysis. Differences in OS stratifying patients according to DFI, estrogen receptor status and PS did not attain statistical significance. Patients receiving MET survived significantly longer than those <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>observation</b> and this difference maintained the statistical significance also within patient subsets homogeneous for specific prognostic features. In conclusion, most prognostic factors for advanced BC have been confirmed in our series of patients obtaining CR, PR or SD to full dose epirubicin.
