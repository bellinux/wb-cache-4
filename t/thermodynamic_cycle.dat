25|$|Air-conditioning and {{refrigeration}} and HVAC: Centrifugal compressors {{quite often}} supply the compression in water chillers cycles. Because {{of the wide}} variety of vapor compression cycles (<b>thermodynamic</b> <b>cycle,</b> thermodynamics) and {{the wide variety of}} workings gases (refrigerants), centrifugal compressors are used {{in a wide range of}} sizes and configurations. Use of real gas properties is needed to properly design, test and analyze the performance of these machines. Standards set by the industry for these compressors include ASHRAE, ASME & API.|$|E
25|$|By {{combining}} both gas {{and steam}} cycles, high input temperatures and low output temperatures can be achieved. The {{efficiency of the}} cycles add, because they are powered by the same fuel source. So, a combined cycle plant has a <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>cycle</b> that operates between the gas-turbine's high firing temperature and the waste heat temperature from the condensers of the steam cycle. This large range means that the Carnot efficiency of the cycle is high. The actual efficiency, while lower than this, is still {{higher than that of}} either plant on its own. The actual efficiency achievable is a complex area.|$|E
25|$|In {{most high}} power Stirling engines, both the minimum {{pressure}} and mean {{pressure of the}} working fluid are above atmospheric pressure. This initial engine pressurization can be realized by a pump, or by filling the engine from a compressed gas tank, or even just by sealing the engine when the mean temperature {{is lower than the}} mean operating temperature. All of these methods increase the mass of working fluid in the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>cycle.</b> All of the heat exchangers must be sized appropriately to supply the necessary heat transfer rates. If the heat exchangers are well designed and can supply the heat flux needed for convective heat transfer, then the engine, in a first approximation, produces power in proportion to the mean pressure, as predicted by the West number, and Beale number. In practice, the maximum pressure is also limited to the safe pressure of the pressure vessel. Like most aspects of Stirling engine design, optimization is multivariate, and often has conflicting requirements. A difficulty of pressurization is that while it improves the power, the heat required increases proportionately to the increased power. This heat transfer is made increasingly difficult with pressurization since increased pressure also demands increased thicknesses of the walls of the engine, which, in turn, increase the resistance to heat transfer.|$|E

The simulation results show that gas parcels working {{in different parts of}} ITPTR undergo different <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>cycles.</b> The net effects of those <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>cycles</b> are pumping heat from the low temperature part to the high temperature part of the system. The simulation results also show that under different frequencies of piston movement, the gas parcels working in the same part of the system will undergo the same type of <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>cycles.</b> The simulated thermal cycles are compared with those thermodynamic analysis results from a reference.

2500|$|Every single {{thermodynamic}} system {{exists in a}} particular state.

2500|$|The basic {{operation}} of the CANDU design is similar to other nuclear reactors. Fission reactions in the reactor core heat pressurized water in a primary cooling loop. A heat exchanger, {{also known as a}} steam generator, transfers the heat to a secondary cooling loop, which powers a steam turbine with an electric generator attached to it (for a typical Rankine <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>cycle).</b> The exhaust steam from the turbines is then cooled, condensed and returned as feedwater to the steam generator. The final cooling often uses cooling water from a nearby source, such as a lake, river, or ocean. Newer CANDU plants, such as the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station near Toronto, Ontario, use a diffuser to spread the warm outlet water over a larger volume and limit the effects on the environment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{thermodynamic}} {{definition of}} entropy {{was developed in}} the early 1850s by Rudolf Clausius and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an isolated system in thermodynamic equilibrium with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the Carnot cycle. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its absolute temperature). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>cycle</b> but eventually return to the same value {{at the end of every}} cycle. Thus it was found to be a function of state, specifically a thermodynamic state of the system. Clausius wrote that he [...] "intentionally formed the word Entropy as similar as possible to the word Energy", basing the term on the Greek ἡ [...] tropē, [...] "transformation".|$|E

Both synthetic and natural substrates are taken into account. Water vapor adsorption isotherms on each ion-exchanged sample have been obtained at 298, 318, 338, and 358 K and have then been modeled using the Dubinin-Astakhov equation. Focusing on the possible implementation of such adsorbents in <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>cycles,</b> an estimation of their specific heat storage densities has been expressed. Results revealed that adsorbents of natural origin are not suitable for a valid employment in <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>cycles,</b> while FAU-type zeolite X samples exchanged with Sr 2 + or divalent transition metal ions (i. e., Zn 2 + or Cd 2 +) show a significant potential as heat storage media.

2500|$|The vapor-compression {{cycle is}} used in most {{household}} refrigerators {{as well as in}} many large commercial and industrial refrigeration systems. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram of the components of a typical vapor-compression refrigeration system. [...] The thermodynamics of the cycle can be analyzed on a diagram as shown in Figure 2. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as Freon enters the compressor as a vapor. From point 1 to point 2, the vapor is compressed at constant entropy and exits the compressor as a vapor at a higher temperature, but still below the vapor pressure at that temperature. From point 2 to point 3 and on to point 4, the vapor travels through the condenser which cools the vapor until it starts condensing, and then condenses the vapor into a liquid by removing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature. Between points 4 and 5, the liquid refrigerant goes through the expansion valve (also called a throttle valve) where its pressure abruptly decreases, causing flash evaporation and auto-refrigeration of, typically, {{less than half of the}} liquid. [...] That results in a mixture of liquid and vapor at a lower temperature and pressure as shown at point 5. The cold liquid-vapor mixture then travels through the evaporator coil or tubes and is completely vaporized by cooling the warm air (from the space being refrigerated) being blown by a fan across the evaporator coil or tubes. The resulting refrigerant vapor returns to the compressor inlet at point 1 to complete the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Bernoulli's {{equation}} is sometimes valid for {{the flow of}} gases: provided {{that there is no}} transfer of kinetic or potential energy from the gas flow to the compression or expansion of the gas. [...] If both the gas pressure and volume change simultaneously, then work will be done on or by the gas. [...] In this case, Bernoulli's equation – in its incompressible flow form – cannot be assumed to be valid. [...] However, if the gas process is entirely isobaric, or isochoric, then no work is done on or by the gas, (so the simple energy balance is not upset). [...] According to the gas law, an isobaric or isochoric process is ordinarily the only way to ensure constant density in a gas. [...] Also the gas density will be proportional to the ratio of pressure and absolute temperature, however this ratio will vary upon compression or expansion, no matter what non-zero quantity of heat is added or removed. [...] The only exception is if the net heat transfer is zero, as in a complete <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>cycle,</b> or in an individual isentropic (frictionless adiabatic) process, and even then this reversible process must be reversed, to restore the gas to the original pressure and specific volume, and thus density. [...] Only then is the original, unmodified Bernoulli equation applicable. [...] In this case the equation can be used if the flow speed of the gas is sufficiently below the speed of sound, such that the variation in density of the gas (due to this effect) along each streamline can be ignored. [...] Adiabatic flow at less than Mach 0.3 is generally considered to be slow enough.|$|E
