500|$|In September 2012, Marco Beltrami, who {{previously}} scored James Mangold's film [...] (2007), {{announced that he}} had signed on to score The Wolverine. Following Mangold's noir and Spaghetti Western inspirations for the film, Beltrami explained, [...] "I think I do every movie as a western whether it is or not, so there’s definitely some of the spaghetti western influence on my music throughout the score, and I guess throughout a lot of my work. I wouldn’t say there was a particular movie that influenced me more than something else. There was nothing that I was trying to mimic or anything." [...] On associating sounds with the film's primary location, Beltrami said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> thing that Jim [...] and I wanted to do was Japanese music associated with Japanese places. There's a reference; I do use Japanese instruments, [...] not really in a traditional way." [...] The score was performed by an 85-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the album}} Untouchables leaking onto the Internet, Take a Look in the Mirror was {{released}} on a Friday, November 21, 2003 – four days earlier than its original release date. The album therefore received a weekend's worth of sales, {{which resulted in a}} poor showing on the Billboard 200. During its first full week, Take a Look in the Mirror soared ten places from number nineteen to number nine, increasing the album's total sales to 179,000. It is the first album self-produced by Korn. The band explained that they wanted fans to hear the music as it should be. The album presented different styles and themes compared to previous albums. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis related: [...] "The whole album is about love, hate and my hate of people and just losing my mind. The previous albums I did, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> three, I was coming from a place of hurt. And I just finally {{got to the point where}} I'm done hurting and I'm just pissed off about it now. It's turned back to just sheer hate and anger. And it definitely comes across on the album." [...] MTV News said that Davis convinced his fans that they [...] "will be shocked, particularly with the album's second track, 'Break Some Off,' which he called 'brutal'." [...] Korn released the single [...] "Did My Time" [...] on July 22, 2003, which was used to promote the film but did not appear on the soundtrack to [...] due to unspecified legal issues. The single debuted and peaked at number thirty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Korn's first and only top-forty hit in the United States. [...] "Did My Time" [...] gave Korn another Grammy nomination in the Best Metal Performance category.|$|E
500|$|Edwards {{opted to}} remain at Accrington ahead of the 2007–08 season, signing a {{contract}} extension in May 2007. He played his {{first game of the}} campaign in late August 2007, a 2–0 defeat at Lincoln City. Following Accrington's 4–1 home win against Grimsby Town in September 2007, a game in which Edwards appeared as a 90th-minute substitute, he did not feature in the first-team for two months. He returned to first-team action on 17 November 2007, playing in the club's 1–0 home defeat to Rotherham United. Following a spate of late substitute appearances, Edwards was ever present in the first-team from December 2007 onwards. He scored his first goal of the 2007–08 season on 4 April 2008, scoring the winner in a 1–0 win against Dagenham & Redbridge. The goal all but guaranteed League Two survival for Accrington. It was Edwards' only goal of the season, playing 32 games in all competitions. Edwards started in Accrington's first game of the 2008–09 season, a 1–0 home loss to newly promoted Aldershot Town. In October 2008, Accrington manager John Coleman praised Edwards for his form during the start of the season, [...] "I couldn't pay him enough compliments. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> six months he has been absolutely magnificent. I am convinced if he was three inches bigger he would be playing in the Premier League. He is our best defender and hopefully he'll continue to be a great player for us for a long time". Edwards remained ever present in the Accrington first-team, but was taken off after 17 minutes in Accrington's 2–1 win against Shrewsbury Town. Despite needing eight stitches in his knee, Edwards played in Accrington's following league match four days later, a 1–0 home defeat to Wycombe Wanderers. He provided the assist for Paul Mullin's goal in a defeat at Wycombe Wanderers, as well as assisting Jamie Clarke's second goal in a 3–1 home win over Grimsby Town. Edwards played in every one of Accrington's 50 games during the 2008–09 season, with the club finishing 16th in the league table.|$|E
