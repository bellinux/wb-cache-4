But the first time I told him what I expected {{of him as a}} husband it came as a shock. After dinner one night he said, [...] "Boy, Betty, something you said hit me like a ton of bricks. Here I've been going along having our little workshops with me doing all the talking and you doing all the listening." [...] He concluded our marriage should be a mutual exchange.|$|E

You should work for the Huffington Post", the latter being a liberal news and aggregated blog website that Alec Baldwin has been a contributor to since 2005. Elisa tells Jack that [...] "Señor Macho Solo" [...] is [...] "what we call a McRib sandwich", a sandwich sold at McDonald's. NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) does the [...] "Top That" [...] rap from the fantasy-comedy film Teen Witch (1989). Jenna sings the song [...] "Piece of My Heart", from Janis Joplin, though, the lyrics had been reworded by Jack so that Sheinhardt Universal avoid legal problems. In addition, Jenna sings the song and carries a bottle of Jack Daniel's in hand, a real life trait of the late singer.|$|E
500|$|The {{first half}} of Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was {{recorded}} shortly {{after the completion of}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik; the second half between late 1991 and early 1992, during the album's tour. [...] "Running Away Into You" [...] is the only track recorded after he left the Chili Peppers. The album is a heavily experimental avant-garde composition whose initial purpose was spiritual and emotional expression: [...] "I wrote [...] because I was in a really big place in my head—it was a huge, spiritual place <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> to do. As long as I'm obeying those forces, it's always going to be meaningful. I could be playing guitar and I could say 'Play something that sucks,' and if I'm in that place, it's gonna be great. And {{it has nothing to do}} with me, except in ways that can't be understood." [...] Frusciante further asserted that the album was meant to be experienced as a cohesive unit rather than separate entities or songs. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was released on Rick Rubin's label American Recordings. Warner Bros., the Chili Peppers' label, owned rights to the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. However, because he was reclusive, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album at the urging of Frusciante's friends.|$|E
