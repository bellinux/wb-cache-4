During the meiosis, the alien telocentric chromosomes of three DtAALs completely paired at the pachytene and usually separated to each daughter cell at anaphase I, giving rise to viable gametes with an alien <b>telocentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> at high frequencies. These DtAALs were characterized by stable transmission of the alien <b>telocentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> in the progenies. The transmission rates of the alien chromosome were considerably high in the DtAALs, and most plants of their self-pollinated progeny carried at least one alien <b>telocentric</b> <b>chromosome.</b> The pollen and seed fertility were different among three DtAALs. DtAAL 11 carrying a short <b>telocentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> of O. punctata showed high pollen and seed fertility similar to the disomies.

The stan-dard diploid karyotype of the house mouse consisting of 40 <b>telocentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> may be reduced {{by the emergence of}} metacentric Rb chromosomes. Multiple simple Rb heterozygotes form trivalents exhibiting higher anaphase nondisjunction frequency and conse-quently higher number of unbalanced gametes than in normal males. This work will attempt to establish whether frequencies of aneuploidy observed in hetero-zygote spermatids of the house mouse M. musculus domesticus show differences in chromosomes derived from different trivalents. Towards this goal, the number and distribution frequency of aneuploidy was assessed via FISH staining of specific chromosomes of sperma-tids derived from 2 n= 32 individuals. Our results showed that for a given set of target chromosomes, 90 % of the gametes were balanced, resulting from alternate segregation, and that there were no differences (approx. 10 %) in aneuploidy frequencies in chromo-somes derived from different trivalents. These observa-tions suggest that segregation effectiveness does not depend on the type of chromosomes involved in triva-lents. As a consequence of the trivalent’s configuration, joint segregation of the <b>telocentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> occurs thus favoring their appearance together in early sperma-tids. Our data suggest that Rb <b>chromosomes</b> and their <b>telocentric</b> homologs are subject to architectural con-straints placing them close to each other.

Interestingly, an intriguing interspecific variation in the <b>telocentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> number has been useful in species identification. To address certain uncertainties related {{to one of the}} species groups of Dendropsophus, the D. microcephalus group, we carried out a cytogenetic analysis combined with phylogenetic inferences based on mitochondrial sequences, which aimed to aid in the analysis of chromosomal characters. Populations of Dendropsophus nanus, Dendropsophus walfordi, Dendropsophus sanborni, Dendropsophus jimi and Dendropsophus elianeae, ranging from the extreme south to the north of Brazil, were cytogenetically compared. A mitochondrial region of the ribosomal 12 S gene from these populations, as well as from 30 other species of Dendropsophus, was used for the phylogenetic inferences. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Results: The species D. nanus and D. walfordi exhibited identical karyotypes (2 n = 30; FN = 52), with four pairs of telocentric chromosomes and a NOR located on metacentric chromosome pair 13. In all of the phylogenetic hypotheses, the paraphyly of D. nanus and D. walfordi was inferred. D. sanborni from Botucatu-SP and Torres-RS showed the same karyotype as D. jimi, with 5 pairs of telocentric chromosomes (2 n = 30; FN = 50) and a terminal NOR in the long arm of the <b>telocentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> pair 12. Despite their karyotypic similarity, these species were not found to compose a monophyletic group. Finally, the phylogenetic and cytogenetic analyses did not cluster the specimens of D. elianeae according to their geographical occurrence or recognized morphotypes. Conclusions: We suggest that a taxonomic revision of the taxa D. nanus and D. walfordi is quite necessary. We also observe that the number of telocentric chromosomes is useful to distinguish among valid species in some cases, although it is unchanged in species that are not necessarily closely related phylogenetically. Therefore, inferences based on this chromosomal character must be made with caution; a proper evolutionary analysis of the karyotypic variation in Dendropsophus depends on further characterization of the telocentric chromosomes found in this group. © 2013 Medeiros et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Dendropsophus is a {{monophyletic}} anuran genus with a {{diploid number}} of 30 chromosomes {{as an important}} synapomorphy. However, the internal phylogenetic relationships of this genus are poorly understood. Interestingly, an intriguing interspecific variation in the <b>telocentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> number has been useful in species identification. To address certain uncertainties related {{to one of the}} species groups of Dendropsophus, the D. microcephalus group, we carried out a cytogenetic analysis combined with phylogenetic inferences based on mitochondrial sequences, which aimed to aid in the analysis of chromosomal characters. Populations of Dendropsophus nanus, Dendropsophus walfordi, Dendropsophus sanborni, Dendropsophus jimi and Dendropsophus elianeae, ranging from the extreme south to the north of Brazil, were cytogenetically compared. A mitochondrial region of the ribosomal 12 S gene from these populations, as well as from 30 other species of Dendropsophus, was used for the phylogenetic inferences. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses. The species D. nanus and D. walfordi exhibited identical karyotypes (2 n[*]=[*] 30; FN[*]=[*] 52), with four pairs of telocentric chromosomes and a NOR located on metacentric chromosome pair 13.

40|$|Cytogenetic {{studies on}} 64 rat leukemias induced with 7, 8, 12 - and 6, 8, 12 -trimethylbenz(a) {{anthracene}} were performed. Highly distinctive changes were found repeatedly in one special pair of chromosomes. 10 leukemias (15. 6 %) showed {{the presence of}} stemline(s) with trisomy of the largest <b>telocentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> (C- 1 trisomy). Another chromosome abnormality, elongation {{of one of the}} pairs of the same chromosome (long C- 1), was found in 5 leukemias (7. 8 %) as the predominant stemline and in 7 other cases as a small cell population. This chromosome abnormality, despite slight differences in their elongation rate, was defined as a new specific chromosome abnormality. Other chromosome abnormalities not related with C- 1 chromosome were found in 8 cases (12. 5 %). The remaining 41 leukemias (64. 1 %) had the predominant stemline with normal karyotype. From this study it appears that three structurally different hydrocarbon carcinogens, 7, 12 -dimethylbenz(a) anthracene and 7, 8, 12 - and 6, 8, 12 -trimethylbenz(a) anthracene act on blood-forming cells by a common specific mechanism...|$|E
50|$|These {{findings}} {{were supported by}} analyses of other markers, primarily chromosomal polymorphism and t-haplotypes. The karyotype of the house mouse normally consists of 40 <b>telocentric</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> but in certain regions in Europe, mice with karyotypes containing fewer than 40 chromosomes can be found. The reduction in chromosome number is due to centric fusion (Robertsonian translocation) of two telocentrics into a single metacentric. Klein’s group found populations with metacentric chromosomes in different regions of Europe, but concentrated its effort on the system of metacentrics in southern Germany. An in-depth study of these populations revealed subdivision into subpopulations, which correlated with that established by the studies of H2 polymorphism.|$|R

Plos One, 10 (9), 16. doi: 10. 1371 /journal. pone. 0137747 In most eukaryotes, centromeres {{assemble}} at {{a single}} location per <b>chromosome.</b> Naturally occurring <b>telocentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (telosomes) with a terminal centromere are rare but do exist. Telosomes arise through misdivision of centromeres in normal chromosomes, and their cytological stability depends {{on the structure of}} their kinetochores. The instability of telosomes may be attributed to the relative centromere size and the degree of completeness of their kinetochore. Here we test this hypothesis by analyzing the cytogenetic structure of wheat telosomes. We used a population of 80 telosomes arising from the misdivision of the 21 chromosomes of wheat that have shown stable inheritance overmany generations. We analyzed centromere size by probing with the centromere-specific histone H 3 variant, CENH 3. Comparing the signal intensity for CENH 3 between the intact chromosome and derived telosomes showed that the telosomes had approximately half the signal intensity compared to that of normal chromosomes. Immunofluorescence of CENH 3 in a wheat stock with 28 telosomes revealed that none of the telosomes received a complete CENH 3 domain. Some of the telosomes lacked centromere specific retrotransposons of wheat in the CENH 3 domain, indicating that the stability of telosomes depends on the presence of CENH 3 chromatin and not on the presence of CRW repeats. In addition to providing evidence for centromere shift, we also observed chromosomal aberrations including inversions and deletions in the short arm telosomes of double ditelosomic 1 D and 6 D stocks. The role of centromere-flanking, pericentromeric heterochromatin in mitosis is discussed with respect to genome/chromosome integrity...|$|R

The number of bivalents in the first meiotic division of M. takahashii was nine (n= 9). The diploid number of M. miyatai was observed to be eighteen (2 n= 18) and their chromosomes consisted of one pair of metacentric, 7 pairs of submetacentric, and one pair of <b>telocentric</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> The diploid number of M. yokogawai was thirty-two (2 n= 32) and the chromosome complements were composed of two pairs of metacentric, 11 pairs of submetacentric, and three pairs of subtelocentric chromosomes.
