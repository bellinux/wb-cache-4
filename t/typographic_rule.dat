Although he gave Penguin's books (particularly the Pelican range) a unified look and enforced many of the typographic practices that are taken for granted today, he allowed the nature of each work to dictate its look, with varied covers and title pages. In working for a firm that made cheap mass-market paperbacks, he was following a line of work—in cheap popular culture forms (e.g. film posters)—that he had always pursued during his career.|$|R

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper One of {{the definitions}} of typography {{is that it is}} the art of arranging typefaces for a specific project and their arrangement in order to achieve a more effective communication. In order to choose the appropriate typeface, the user should be well-acquainted with visual or geometric features of typography, <b>typographic</b> <b>rules</b> and the historical development of typography. Additionally, every user is further assisted by a good quality and simple typeface classification. There are many different classifications of typefaces based on historical or visual criteria, as well as their combination. During the last thirty years, computers and digital technology have enabled brand new creative freedoms. As a result, there are thousands of fonts and dozens of applications for digitally creating typefaces. This paper suggests an innovative, simpler classification, which should correspond to the contemporary development of typography, the production of a vast number of new typefaces and the needs of today's users...|$|R
30|$|The {{organization}} of a document {{can be classified}} into two main aspects: the logical and the physical. The logical layer of the document defined above corresponds to its logical organization with the same elements (e.g., headings, titles/subtitles, chapters, paragraphs, tables, lists, footnotes, and appendices). At the page level, the physical {{organization of}} a document is described by its layout layer {{in connection with the}} physical realization of a number of logical layout elements. The organization of a printed or an electronic multipage document as a whole corresponds with the physical implementation of a number of logical layer elements (e.g., chapters, appendices, and indexed references). The organization of a document is domain-specific (e.g., text book, scientific paper, technical report, newspaper, and magazine). The authors use typography and layout in a specific way, e.g., they have to follow strict <b>typographic</b> <b>rules</b> for the documents to be published in a scientific journal. But, in the case of newspapers and books, the page designer (or the page manager), and not the author, has the primary responsibility for applying the typography and the layout layers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} new {{hierarchical}} MDL-based {{model for a}} joint detection and classification of multilingual text lines in im-ages taken by hand-held cameras. The majority of related text detec-tion methods assume alphabet-based writing in a single language, e. g. in Latin. They use simple clustering heuristics specific to such texts: prox-imity between letters within one line, larger distance between separate lines, etc. We are interested in a significantly more ambiguous problem where images combine alphabet and logographic characters from multi-ple languages and <b>typographic</b> <b>rules</b> vary a lot (e. g. English, Korean, and Chinese). Complexity of detecting and classifying text lines in multiple languages calls for a more principled approach based on information-theoretic principles. Our new MDL model includes data costs combining geometric errors with classification likelihoods and a hierarchical sparsity term based on label costs. This energy model can be efficiently minimized by fusion moves. We demonstrate robustness of the proposed algorithm on a large new database of multilingual text images collected in the pub-lic transit system of Seoul...|$|R

Significantly higher complexity of fitting multiple lines of text in different languages calls for an energy-based formulation combining a data fidelity term and a regularization prior.

Our energy can be efficiently minimized by fusion moves. The algorithm was evaluated on a database of images from the subway of metropolitan area of Seoul and was proven to be robust...|$|R
40|$|Diacritical marks play {{a crucial}} role in meeting the {{criteria}} of usability of typographic text, such as: homogeneity, clarity and legibility. To change the diacritic of a letter in a word could completely change its semantic. The situation is very complicated with multilingual text. Indeed, the problem of design becomes more difficult by the presence of diacritics that come from various scripts; they are used for different purposes, and are controlled by various <b>typographic</b> <b>rules.</b> It is quite challenging to adapt rules from one script to another. This paper aims to study the placement and sizing of diacritical marks in Arabic script, with a comparison with the Latin’s case. The Arabic script is cursive and runs from right-to-left; its criteria and rules are quite distinct from those of the Latin script. In the beginning, we compare the difficulty of processing diacritics in both scripts. After, we will study the limits of Latin resolution strategies when applied to Arabic. At the end, we propose an approach to resolve the problem for positioning and resizing diacritics. This strategy includes creating an Arabic font, designed in OpenType format, along with suitable justification in TEX...|$|R

It {{has been set up}} through an exemplary partnership between the Library and The Faculty of Graduates Studies. The Graduate students involved in our ETD project are using an MS Word model (. dot), developed in conformity with the <b>typographic</b> <b>rules</b> set up by the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Representatives from both units spent quite a bit of time discussing the training issue and the adequate form of workflow. Pedagogical tools were designed in order to help students to use the MS Word Model properly and some enhanced functionality of the software. During 2002, more than 200 doctorates students participated in training sessions held in a computer lab. This overwhelming success prompted us to develop an online version, using a WebCT platform. The training itself contains lessons, illustrations demonstrations and exercises. Various forms of assistance are available to participants (forum, mail). Our workflow involves an initial submission of the paper which allows us to check the"convertability"of the student etd. At this point, we can spot problems if there be and ask the student to make adjustments before the final submission. The latter is being made only through an electronic format (the paper version of the thesis is not required). In 2003, we plan to support the LaTeX format and enventually an open source format (like Open Office). The ETD training will be available to the Master's degree students in January 2003 and we expect a huge demand even though the electronic submission is not mandatory yet for all programs...|$|R
40|$|Many {{important}} classical {{texts in}} Indian literature have never reached a global audience; others are becoming unavailable even to Indian readers. This strategic design project {{was commissioned by}} the Murty Library, {{with the aim of}} creating an accessible classical library to provide modern translations of important Indian texts available in print and online. Funded by a trust set up by the Indian industrialist Rohan Murty and overseen by Harvard University Press, a framework was created for the design of the printed book interiors, digital texts and Indic typography for jacket designs. The challenge of this project is to find contemporary designs solutions to classical texts (pre 1800) whilst retaining their spirit and originality. Research is based on key subject areas: history of the book and printing in India, language and scripts of India, reading and reader interactions with texts and bilingual translations employing multi-script typography. The typesetting and design of bilingual Indic texts of such range and complexity is unprecedented in modern book design practice and poses many challenges that are addressed through three lines of enquiry. First, to establish a systematic bilingual book design for English translations of texts in ten different Indian languages and scripts grouped into four categories: North Brahmic (Sanskrit, Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali), South Brahmic (Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada), Perso-Arabic (Urdu, Sindhi) and Prakrit (Pali). Second, to accommodate two genres in the template design: poetry and prose. Third, as Indian texts do not use italics or bold, it is imperative to establish an Indic hierarchy and grammar through the application of <b>typographic</b> <b>rules.</b> The book designs and typesetting are created by Rathna Ramanathan using bespoke typefaces designed by John Hudson, Fiona Ross and others. Ramanathan is assisted by Guglielmo Rossi, a young designer is laying out the texts for publication. Currently 13 volumes have been completed and a further 12 are planned for completion by 2018...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation thesis {{deals with}} the {{possibilities}} of automated documents quality evaluation. The quality is specified as the formal quality, particularly the typographic aspects of documents processing are emphasized. Documents represent the organization {{but they are not}} often checked for their formal quality level. Automated checking and evaluation would be helpful. In many areas, the attention is paid to the quality. The documents formal quality is not the main area of interest. In the literature, mainly the aesthetic or typographic aspects are concerned. However, the research showed that high-quality documents {{have a positive effect on}} readers so that the documents quality is important. The documents analysis made for different purposes is the present trend and the methods are focused on objects recognition in the page as well as on the objects classification. In this context, a number of various methods working at different documents levels were developed. Especially the artificial intelligence methods, which are primarily used for classification, can be helpful. Existing methods can be used for further work. In this thesis, a procedure for methods assessment was designed, which concentrates on methods' suitability for automated evaluation of documents quality. The selected methods should provide enough relevant data for evaluation. The important part of the thesis is the mathematical model design that describes the document by a set of parameters. Selected parameters should reflect the relevant characteristics of the document at different levels, from page elements to the whole document. The set of parameters and their values build a formal image of the document, which is one of the inputs for the quality evaluation. The other input for the quality evaluation process is the set of rules for documents which consists mainly from the <b>typographic</b> <b>rules.</b> The rules which have a positive effect on the documents quality were selected. The essential contribution to the automated evaluation is the formalization of these rules by the mathematical apparatus. The formalized rules and the document model are the inputs to the quality evaluation process. A formalized evaluation of the parameters according to the selected rules is designed to discover the information about the document quality. For this purpose, an expert system is very suitable. Apart from evaluation, it can also provide explanation and advice. The entire procedure is demonstrated on the sample document and the evaluation is described. This thesis {{deals with the}} area which is still relatively unusual and integrates various disciplines, from typography through documents analysis to the artificial intelligence. The thesis is focused on analysis and design of the automated method for documents quality evaluation with a possible further development in the future...|$|R
40|$|As {{computers}} {{become more}} {{abundant in the}} home and office, more people are performing tasks that once would have been done by a skilled professional. Computers and software programs have become easier to use, including desktop publishing programs. Programs are now available that allow anyone to 2 ̆ 2 become a designer. 2 ̆ 2 Through this, however, most typographers agree, the typographic quality of documents has suffered. Many companies are now designing their own media, in an effort to save money. The documents they create are adequate, but there is something missing. Though {{they may not be able}} to explain why, most people can appreciate the appearance of the professionally typeset page. The goal of this thesis project is to make it easier for a non-professional to make typo graphically pleasing text pages. The basic rules of typography, without regard to fluxuating design trends, have essentially stayed the same for hundreds of years. Background research for this project was completed by studying historically significant typographic manuals of the last 300 years. Research began with Joseph Moxon 2 ̆ 7 s Mechanick Exercises (1694) and ended with the most recent edition of The Chicago Manual of Style (1993), one of today 2 ̆ 7 s most highly regarded manuals. From this background research, minimum and preferred software requirements for desktop publishing software applications were created. The purpose of these requirements is to encourage software manufacturers to incorporate more automation in regard to typography, as well as to encourage improved default settings in their software applications. The goal was to make the minimum requirements realistically achievable. Many of the minimum requirements are currently available in software programs; however, no one program contains all of the requirements. Each software program has strengths and weaknesses. From these lists of requirements, the specifications for the 2 ̆ 2 ideal 2 ̆ 2 software application were created. Through this 2 ̆ 2 ideal 2 ̆ 2 application, all of the best features of current software programs were brought together, in addition to a few innovative ideas. These specifications only relate to the typographic capabilities of the software, and do not include other areas such as color or image manipulation. Though these specifications could vastly improve on the quality of typography produced electronically, automated tasks completed by a computer will never produce the same results as a job done manually by a skilled professional. Computer programming is limited and many <b>typographic</b> <b>rules</b> cannot be adequately defined in a computer algorithm. Though perfection may not be attainable, improvement is possible...|$|R

40|$|Typesetting and {{typography}} {{have become}} misunderstood terms, if not obsolete, {{due to the}} proliferation of computers. Since every computer user has access to a myriad of typefaces {{and the ability to}} modify type through software, the true qualities of many typefaces have become unrecognizable. Therefore, it is incumbent upon people to seek out the information necessary to be competent in the area of design and typography. A well-designed type specimen is the first place to start for a user to reference <b>typographic</b> terminology and <b>rules.</b> Technical characteristics of typefaces such as tracking, font metrics, leading and unique recognizable characters could prove to be an invaluable tool for many people, not just designers. In addition to a type specimen being a subtle tutorial, it should also be educational. Computer technology has opened the door for many people and has increased their exposure to typefaces and typography. On the other hand, it has also led many to believe that by typing on the computer, they are setting type correctly. There are many rules and guidelines that should be followed to insure the correct usage of type, both aesthetically and typographically. And everyone - designers, printers, typesetters and the general public, need to learn and practice these rules and terminology to uphold the standards of typography that have evolved over the centuries. Type specimen books have been used for centuries, and due to the influx of technology, that same information is easily accessible on a computer. Many designers were initially reluctant to use a specimen on the computer. It did not seem as 2 ̆ 7 pure 2 ̆ 7 as a type specimen book. The computer would add glitz and glimmer while sacrificing quality and quantity of information. But as more and more specimens became available on the computer, it became obvious that huge amounts of information could be included and continually updated, whereas it would be far too much to include in a book. A well- designed userfriendly specimen could be an invaluable tool to a designer. Many specimens, while being aesthetically pleasing, were not useful as a reference tool or educational aid. While everyone has their own reasons for wanting specific attributes in a specimen, these needs all begin to intermix and overlap, thusly forming a complex entity. Designers, printers and typesetters may all have different needs, but they all have one thing in common: everyone wants a useable and helpful type specimen book. An interactive type specimen is a necessary and valuable tool for any professional in the graphic industry. The ease of use, the ability to keep it updated, and the cohesive format make an interactive specimen useful to all levels of type users. Since printed material is outdated as soon as it is completed, an interactive piece has the flexibility to be continually updated - keeping the users up-to-date on the trends, news and information regarding type and typography...|$|R
