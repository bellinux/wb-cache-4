5|$|The cousins {{went back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to search for the source of the red paint on the silencer. In the kitchen they found marks in the red paint {{on the underside of the}} mantelpiece above the Aga cooker. DI Cook, a scenes-of-crime officer, took a paint sample from the mantelpiece on 14 August. This was found to contain the same 15 layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on the silencer. Casts were taken of <b>the</b> <b>marks</b> on the mantel, and <b>the</b> <b>marks</b> were deemed consistent with the silencer having come into contact several times with the mantelpiece. The implication was that the silencer had scratched the mantelpiece during a fight for the gun.|$|E

5|$|Lobengula {{refused to}} allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document. Exactly why he did this is not clear. Rudd's {{interpretation}} was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so {{did not think it}} necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt that it would be harder to repudiate the document later if it bore <b>the</b> <b>marks</b> of his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E
5|$|The {{class of}} determiners {{is used to}} specify the noun they precede in terms of {{definite}}ness, where <b>the</b> <b>marks</b> a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include one, many, some and all, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree {{with the number of}} the determiner, e.g. one man (sg.) but all men (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.|$|E

5|$|The {{genre of}} Midas bears <b>the</b> <b>marks</b> of gender debates, as well, with Percy {{writing in the}} {{traditionally}} male-dominated form of the lyric and Mary focusing {{on the details of}} everyday life in her verse drama. Since the play's first publication in 1922, critics have paid more attention to Percy Shelley's lyrics than Mary Shelley's drama. However, in the last fifteen years or so, this trend has reversed itself as scholars explore works of Mary Shelley other than Frankenstein (1818).|$|E
5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van {{was parked}} on Corporation Street, outside <b>the</b> <b>Marks</b> & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and sunglasses – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked {{them up in the}} Ford Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E

5|$|Beetle remains bearing what {{appeared}} to be <b>the</b> <b>marks</b> of bird attacks have been found by the River Ouse and hardened adults often bear symmetrically indented elytra, interpreted as 'pinch marks' inflicted by a beak whilst newly emerged adults are still hardening. Dead beetles have also been found in the webs of spiders in a captive population. The accidental predation of C. graminis by livestock consuming the tansy plant is also possible. Predation of a larva by the scorpionfly Panorpa germanica has been observed in the field. The tachinid genus Macquartia exclusively parasitizes Chrysolmelid beetles and one species of which, Macquartia dispar, may parasitise C. graminis directly. The adult fly deposits fully incubated eggs or newly hatched larvae into the vicinity of the host larvae.|$|E
5|$|His {{schedule}} in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he {{competed in the}} long jump and high jump. The first competition was the pentathlon. He won four of the five events and placed third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for <b>the</b> <b>marks</b> achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the high jump final in which he placed fourth, and also took seventh place {{in the long jump}}. Even more remarkably, because someone had stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, he found some discarded ones in a rubbish bin and won his medals wearing them.|$|E
5|$|James Winchester {{arrived in}} Gibraltar on January 15, to inquire when Mary Celeste might be {{released}} to deliver its cargo. Flood demanded a surety of $15,000, money Winchester did not have. He became aware that Flood thought he might have deliberately engaged a crew that would kill Briggs and his officers, as part of some conspiracy. On January 29, during a series of sharp exchanges with Flood, Winchester testified to Briggs's high character, and insisted {{that he would not}} have abandoned the ship except in extremity. Flood's theories of mutiny and murder received significant setbacks when scientific analysis of the stains found on the sword and elsewhere on the ship showed that they were not blood. A second blow to Flood followed in a report commissioned by Horatio Sprague, the American consul in Gibraltar, from Captain Shufeldt of the US Navy. In Shufeldt's view <b>the</b> <b>marks</b> on the bow were not man-made, but came from the natural actions of the sea on the ship's timbers.|$|E

5|$|Several {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} rongorongo {{may have been an}} invention inspired by this visit and the signing of the treaty of annexation. As circumstantial evidence, they note that no explorer reported the script prior to Eugène Eyraud in 1864, and are of the opinion that <b>the</b> <b>marks</b> with which the chiefs signed the Spanish treaty do not resemble rongorongo. The hypothesis of these researchers is not that rongorongo was itself a copy of the Latin alphabet, or of any other form of writing, but that the concept of writing had been conveyed in a process anthropologists term trans-cultural diffusion, which then inspired the islanders to invent their own system of writing. If this is the case, then rongorongo emerged, flourished, fell into oblivion, and was all but forgotten within a span of less than a hundred years.|$|E
5|$|Spent {{cartridges}} {{found at}} a scene can be examined for physical evidence such as fingerprints or compared to samples that match them to a weapon. The examination of the cartridge relies on the unique tool marks left by the {{various parts of the}} weapon including the firing pin and the ejector in semi and fully automatic firearms. These markings can be compared and matched to known exemplars fired from the same weapon using the same parts. The examination of <b>the</b> <b>marks</b> left on the cartridge is done using a comparison microscope. Examiners view the questioned cartridge and the known exemplar simultaneously, looking for similar microscopic marks left during the firing process.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{commissioned}} {{a report from}} Peter Sutherst, a British forensic photographic expert, who was asked in 2008 to examine negatives of the kitchen taken {{on the day of}} the murders and later. In his report, dated 17 January 2010, Sutherst argued that the scratch marks in the red paintwork on the kitchen mantelpiece had been created after the crime-scene photographs had been taken. The prosecution alleged that <b>the</b> <b>marks</b> had been made during the struggle in the kitchen between Bamber and his father, as the silencer, attached to the rifle, had scratched against the mantelpiece. The prosecution said that paint chips identical to the paint on the mantelpiece were found on or inside the silencer.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> VI {{was one of}} a pair {{of related}} {{projects}} to develop the tank initiated in late 1916. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> V would be the application of as many advanced features as could be managed on <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> I hull design and <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VI would be a complete break with <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> I hull. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> V would not be built as such, because of the delays with <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> IV {{and it would be a}} different Mark V that was built. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> VI project design had a completely new hull - taller and with rounded track paths. The single main gun was in the front of the hull. It did not progress past the stage of a wooden mock-up; the project was cancelled in December 1917 in order that a tank co-developed with <b>the</b> US (<b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VIII) could go forward.|$|R
5|$|The {{petrification}} motif {{also appears}} in non-scriptural works. The Raghuvamsa of Kalidasa (generally dated 4th century CE) {{notes that the}} wife of Gautama (unnamed here) momentarily becomes the wife of Indra. Without explicitly mentioning the curse, it relates further that she regains her beautiful form and casts away her stony appearance, owing to the grace provided by the dust of Rama's feet, which redeems her. Gautam Patel, author of many works about Kalidasa, credits him as {{the first person to}} introduce the petrification motif. In the Ramavataram too, Rama does not have to touch Ahalya with his foot; the dust from his feet is enough to bring her back to life. As in other versions of the tale, the repentant Ahalya is turned to stone, only to be liberated by Rama, and Indra runs away disguised as a cat but is cursed to bear <b>the</b> <b>marks</b> of a thousand vulvae. The Ramavataram {{is an example of the}} Bhakti-era poets who exalt Rama as a saviour.|$|E

5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of <b>the</b> <b>marks</b> to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with {{just the right amount of}} ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E

As the war progressed the design was modified to be more rapidly and economically produced. Three simplified models, <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II*, Mark III and Mark III*, entered service in August 1943. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> II* was a transitional model designed to use the new simplified parts, but had backwards compatibility with <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> III and Mark III* versions did away with the rate selector and had simplified parts like <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II*, but were not backwards compatible with <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> III had a fixed high rate of fire (750-850 rpm) and <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> III* had a fixed low rate of fire (450-550 rpm) ...|$|R
