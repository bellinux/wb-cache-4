30|$|In Koster et al. (2004) and Seneviratne et al. (2006), {{two main}} ET regimes are defined: a soil moisture-limited regime and an energy-limited regime. In the energy-limited ET regime, when <b>the</b> soil <b>moisture</b> is above a given {{critical}} soil moisture value, ET {{is independent of}} <b>the</b> soil <b>moisture</b> content. Below <b>the</b> critical soil <b>moisture,</b> <b>the</b> soil <b>moisture</b> constrains <b>the</b> ET (soil moisture-limited ET regime). When <b>the</b> soil <b>moisture</b> {{is lower than the}} wilting point (θwilt), no further ET takes place. Seneviratne et al. (2010) defined a climate dry/wet regime, where <b>the</b> soil <b>moisture</b> is higher than <b>the</b> critical soil <b>moisture</b> value and lower than θwilt, and soil moisture does not impact ET. When <b>the</b> soil <b>moisture</b> is between θwilt and <b>the</b> critical soil <b>moisture</b> value, <b>the</b> soil <b>moisture</b> strongly constrains ET and precipitation could be affected by soil <b>moisture</b> anomalies. <b>The</b> critical soil <b>moisture</b> level typically lies between θwilt and the field capacity, and is typically equal to ca. 50 – 80 % of field capacity. Brubaker et al. (1993) indicated that the precipitation of a region could be supplied by ET from the land surface, indicating the importance of land-surface processes in the water balance. Savenije (1995) analyzed <b>moisture</b> recycling over <b>the</b> Sahel region and found that more than 90 % of rainfall is from <b>the</b> recycling of <b>moisture</b> through ET. Wythers et al. (1999) proposed that evaporation is related to changes in the resistance to evaporation in a particular soil type, the amount of energy available to drive the evaporative process and the amount of water available to evaporate.|$|R

5|$|Larvae pupate 5 to 10cm {{below the}} soil surface. Pupae are brown in color; they measure 5.5mm wide and 17 to 22mm long. The biggest {{environmental}} factor {{that affects the}} pupal developmental rate is temperature, primarily soil temperature. This is because proper insulation facilitates development, and soil temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius correlate to higher pupal mortality. Another factor that influences pupal development is soil moisture. Pupal mortality is high in wet soil, where <b>the</b> <b>moisture</b> level is between 18 and 25 percent. Dehydration {{can also lead to}} high death rates among pupae, if soil moisture is as low as 1 to 2 percent.|$|E
40|$|For the {{prediction}} {{of the air and}} product temperatures, <b>the</b> product <b>moisture,</b> and <b>the</b> air humidity during a coating process in a Bohle Lab-Coater, a model was developed. The purpose of this work was to determine <b>the</b> limit <b>moisture,</b> <b>the</b> critical <b>moisture,</b> and <b>the</b> constant for the exchange rate between both zones and to use these values for other sets of experiments to test the model. The adaptation of the 3 parameters (limit moisture, critical moisture, and exchange rate constant), was done by calculation of the product temperature in both zones for several sets of parameters in order to minimize the sum of square deviation between the calculated and the measured product temperatures. This set of parameters was used to test the validity of the model. By applying the model, the product temperature could be predicted based on the product, process, and equipment-related parameters. Hence, the model can be used to theoretically investigate the influence of different process paramaters. The mean difference between the predicted, and measured product temperatures in the steady state is ≈ 2 up to 3 K using the determined parameter set for <b>the</b> limit <b>moisture,</b> <b>the</b> critical <b>moisture,</b> and <b>the</b> exchange rate constant.

5|$|By late on May 29, a weak trough {{over the}} Yucatán Peninsula {{produced}} {{a small area}} of convection over the Yucatán Channel.

The low moved north-northeastward, and gradually became better organized despite high amounts of vertical wind shear.

5|$|Deserts {{are also}} classified, {{according}} to their geographical location and dominant weather pattern, as trade wind, mid-latitude, rain shadow, coastal, monsoon, or polar deserts. Trade wind deserts occur {{either side of the}} horse latitudes at 30° to 35° North and South. These belts are associated with the subtropical anticyclone and the large-scale descent of dry air moving from high-altitudes toward the poles. The Sahara Desert is of this type. Mid-latitude deserts occur between 30° and 50° North and South. They are mostly in areas remote from the sea where most of <b>the</b> <b>moisture</b> has already precipitated from the prevailing winds. They include the Tengger and Sonoran Deserts. Monsoon deserts are similar. They occur in regions where large temperature differences occur between sea and land. Moist warm air rises over the land, deposits its water content and circulates back to sea. Further inland, areas receive very little precipitation. The Thar Desert near the India/Pakistan border is of this type.|$|E

30|$|In this study, we {{extend the}} {{simulation}} period to 6  months and target a drought period. During the 6 -month study period, the atmospheric condition is dry {{due to the}} lack of the rain. Compared to the study of Lin and Cheng (2016), the ET process is strengthened in this study, indicating that the land–air interactions are significant and ET can be an important source of water vapor when the atmospheric condition is dry. A comparison between the WRF-GLDAS and WRF-GSOIL simulations shows that <b>the</b> soil <b>moisture</b> is reduced in WRF-GSOIL in western Taiwan due to the larger size soil particle that has less capability to hold water, which in turn reduces <b>the</b> soil <b>moisture</b> content compared to the WRF-GLDAS result. <b>The</b> soil <b>moisture</b> is lower in western Taiwan from the WRF-GSOIL, but the LHF is increased, which indicates that ET is independent of <b>the</b> soil <b>moisture</b> content. In fact, due to the unusual dry condition in this study period, <b>the</b> soil <b>moisture</b> can be lower than θwilt. The supply of θwilt according to the soil look-up table generally becomes lower in the updated soil type; hence, the ET process is still on-going in the WRF-GSOIL simulation, while it can cease in the WRF-GLDAS run once <b>the</b> soil <b>moisture</b> is lower than θwilt.|$|R

This species spends more time chewing its food than other similar sized macropods, which likely aids digestion. Tammars commonly feed on acacia seeds. Other species consumed include heart-leaved poison (Gastrolobium bilobum), small-flowered wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia setacea), and marri (Corymbia calophylla).
