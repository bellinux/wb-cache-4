5|$|In the wild, the diets of Campbell's dwarf hamsters vary {{across the}} {{population}} range. A total of 51 {{different species of}} plants were identified <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> by the Transbaikalia population, the most common being Stipa capillata and species of Allium. However, in Tuva, only 10 species of plant were identified <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> by the population, the most common being Potentilla. Campbell's dwarf hamster is a natural predator of burrowing worms and grubs.|$|E
5|$|Halotus {{worked as}} a servant for Claudius and also held the {{position}} of official taster, an occupation which entailed his tasting of a portion of every meal Claudius ate each day for poison. Tasters also worked to detect less sinister problems with the Emperor's meal, such as whether the food was fit <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consumed.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Argentina, Cabernet Sauvignon {{lags behind}} Malbec as the country's main red grape but its numbers are growing. The varietal {{versions}} often have lighter fruit flavors and are meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> young. Premium examples are often blended with Malbec and produce full, tannic wines with leather and tobacco notes. In recent years, {{there have been}} increased plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon in the Uco Valley of the Mendoza Province; the wines coming from vineyards planted at higher altitudes garner some international attention.|$|E

5|$|The fungal {{pathogen}} Metarhizium acridum {{is found}} in Africa, Australia and Brazil where it has caused epizootics in grasshoppers. It is being investigated for possible use as a microbial insecticide for locust control. The microsporidian fungus Nosema locustae, once {{considered to be a}} protozoan, can be lethal to grasshoppers. It has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> by mouth and is the basis for a bait-based commercial microbial pesticide. Various other microsporidians and protozoans are found in the gut.|$|E
5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E
5|$|Among Motul de San José and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros {{were more likely to}} be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they {{were more likely to be}} artefacts at the end of their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E

25|$|Starch {{granules}} {{appear and}} grow throughout the day, as the chloroplast synthesizes sugars, and <b>are</b> <b>consumed</b> at night <b>to</b> fuel respiration and continue sugar export into the phloem, though in mature chloroplasts, {{it is rare}} for a starch granule <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completely <b>consumed</b> or for a new granule to accumulate.|$|R
50|$|Fleshy fungi {{consumed}} include {{members of}} the following genera: Agaricus, Amanita, Boletus, Hypholoma, Lepiota, Lycopedon, Russula and Tuber. Mushrooms poisonous <b>to</b> humans <b>are</b> <b>consumed</b> by Abert's squirrels without difficulty, including destroying angels (A. muscaria and A. vaginata) and a species of Russula.|$|R
5|$|Lactarius vietus milk has a {{very hot}} taste, and the {{mushroom}} lacks a distinctive smell. Although described by many mycologists as inedible, David Pegler claims that its acrid taste can be removed after boiling, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consumed.</b> Though the strong, acrid taste is {{a defining feature of}} the species, it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms, which is not unusual for Lactarius species. Occasionally, however, mushrooms of the species have been collected which have a mild taste; this has also been observed in other species with typically acrid tastes.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the barn}} owl has been much studied; the items {{consumed}} can be ascertained from identifying the prey fragments in the pellets of indigestible matter that the bird regurgitates. Studies of diet {{have been made in}} most parts of the bird's range, and in moist temperate areas over 90% of the prey tends to be small mammals, whereas in hot, dry, unproductive areas, the proportion is lower, and a great variety of other creatures are eaten depending on local abundance. Most prey is terrestrial but bats and birds are also taken, as well as lizards, amphibians and insects. Even when they are plentiful and other prey scarce, earthworms do not seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consumed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare, {{commonly}} known as the pinecone mushroom, the cone tooth, or the ear-pick fungus, is a species of fungus in the family Auriscalpiaceae of the order Russulales. It was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus, who included it {{as a member of the}} tooth fungi genus Hydnum, but British mycologist Samuel Frederick Gray recognized its uniqueness and in 1821 transferred it to the genus Auriscalpium that he created to contain it. The fungus is widely distributed in Europe, Central America, North America, and temperate Asia. Although common, its small size and nondescript colors lead it to be easily overlooked in the pine woods where it grows. A.vulgare is not generally considered edible because of its tough texture, but some historical literature says it used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> in France and Italy.|$|E

5|$|Historically, the Mangalorean Catholic diet was {{completely}} vegetarian. This changed during the 20th century, when {{with the advent}} of Westernisation, meat came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> increasingly in the community, especially amongst the elite. Coconut and curry leaves are common ingredients to most curries. Sanna-Dukra Maas (Sanna is idli fluffed with toddy or yeast; Dukra Maas is pork) {{is one of the most}} popular dishes of the Mangalorean Catholic community. Rosachi Kadi (Ros Curry), a fish curry made with coconut milk (ros), is a traditional curry served during the Ros ceremony. Patrode, a dish of colocasia leaves stuffed with rice, dal, jaggery, coconut, and spices is popular. Kuswar are sweet delicacies prepared during Christmas and include around 22 varieties of sweets. Fish and rice form the staple diet of most Mangalorean Catholics. Par-boiled rice, known as red rice, is the traditional rice eaten and is preferred over raw rice.|$|E
5|$|The roughtail {{stingray}} is reportedly not highly active, spending much time {{buried in the}} sediment. It is a generalist predator whose diet generally reflects the most available prey in its environment. It mainly captures prey off the bottom, but also opportunistically takes free-swimming prey. A variety of invertebrates, as well as bony fishes such as sand lance and scup, are known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consumed.</b> Off Massachusetts, the main prey are crabs (Cancer), bivalves (Mya), gastropods (Polinices), squid (Loligo) and annelid worms. In Delaware Bay, most of its diet consists of the shrimp Cragon septemspinosa and the blood worm Glycera dibranchiata; the overall dietary composition there is nearly identical to that of bluntnose stingrays (D. say) that share the bay. The shrimp Upogebia affinis is a major food source off Virginia. Off Florida, crustaceans (Rananoides, Ovalipes, Sicyonia brevirostris, and Portunus) and polychaete worms {{are the most important}} prey.|$|E
5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet will also need at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> young and will often maintain their green herbal flavors even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavors when they are young and the best made examples will maintain some of those flavors as they age. South African wines tend to favor more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further flavors.|$|E

25|$|The fat of {{the animal}} was the portion {{allocated}} to Yahweh, and was burnt on the altar; the priests were allocated the breast and right shoulder, which was first waved around the altar (making this portion a wave offering); the remainder went to the offerer. The meat had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> within a certain time limit; praise offerings had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> {{on the day of}} the sacrifice, while other types of slaughter offering had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> by the day afterward; any leftovers had to be destroyed on the third day, outside the camp. The offerer was permitted to invite guests to consume the meal with him, along with strangers, paupers, servants, and Levites, as long as they were all ritually clean. The meals were treated as a joyful occasion, and would be accompanied with wine, as well as bread (both leavened and unleavened), oil, and salt.|$|E
