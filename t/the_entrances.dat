5|$|Controversy emerged over Entrance 2's {{location}} in February 2011, when a lawsuit was {{filed by the}} Yorkshire Towers over the location of Entrance 2. <b>The</b> <b>entrances,</b> planned to service 3,600 people an hour, were alleged in the lawsuit to be destroying {{the quality of life}} for building tenants, if <b>the</b> <b>entrances</b> were to be built in the location. The lawsuit was later dismissed because the suit had been filed two years after the FTA's FONSI was published, which was past the statute of limitations. A new lawsuit was filed on March 15, 2013, after the MTA started construction on <b>the</b> <b>entrances.</b> In June 2013, that lawsuit was also dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{is built}} of, primarily, yellow, but also {{black and red}} {{polished}} tuff. It has three entrances. The main one is on the western side. <b>The</b> <b>entrances</b> on {{the northern and southern}} sides, though secondary, are richly decorated. Its windows are narrow and long, with ornamented frames.|$|E

5|$|Barring Link's {{progress}} are creatures he must {{battle to}} locate <b>the</b> <b>entrances</b> to nine underground dungeons. Each dungeon is a unique, maze-like collection of rooms connected by doors and secret passages, and guarded by monsters {{different from those}} found on the surface. Dungeons also contain useful items which Link can add to his arsenal, such as a boomerang for retrieving distant items and stunning enemies, and a recorder with magical properties. Link must successfully navigate through {{each of the first}} eight dungeons to obtain all eight pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom. Once he has completed the artifact, he can enter the ninth dungeon to rescue Zelda. Apart from this exception, the order of completing dungeons is somewhat left to the player, although they steadily increase in difficulty and some of them can only be reached or completed using items gained in a previous one. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>entrances</b> of the three highest-level dungeons are hidden. Link can freely wander the overworld, finding and buying items at any point. This flexibility enables unusual ways of playing the game. For example, it is possible to reach the final boss of the game without ever receiving the first sword.|$|E
5|$|Families {{throughout}} Han China made ritual sacrifices (usually involving {{animals and}} foodstuffs) to various deities, spirits, and ancestors. Deceased ancestors {{were thought to}} require food and drink in the afterlife, so living family members were routinely obligated to offer food and wine to the ancestors in a family shrine or temple. Wealthy families who could afford to bury their dead in large tombs often placed the food items at <b>the</b> <b>entrances</b> of such complexes.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Entrance</b> Bridge links <b>The</b> <b>Entrance</b> with <b>The</b> <b>Entrance</b> North over <b>The</b> <b>Entrance</b> Channel {{as part of}} Wilfred Barrett Drive. It was {{originally}} a wooden single lane bridge with bypass bays and a traffic light that allowed traffic travelling {{in the opposite direction}} to pass. It was opened in 1934. The original bridge was adequate until 1965 as it only served traffic travelling as far as <b>The</b> <b>Entrance</b> North.|$|R

5|$|Group G {{lies just}} south of the Mendez Causeway. The complex dates to the Late Classic and {{consists}} of palace-type structures {{and is one of the}} largest groups of its type at Tikal. It has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor, a total of 29 vaulted chambers. The remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey. One of <b>the</b> <b>entrances</b> to the group was framed by a gigantic mask.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the Regional Plan Association {{considered}} a full-length Second Avenue Subway, which included 72nd Street {{as one of}} its planned 31 stations. <b>The</b> <b>entrances</b> to 72nd Street station were to be located at 70th, 72nd, and 74th Streets. The final environmental impact statement was released for the station in April 2004. The initial design of the 72nd Street station lasted about eight years, between 1999 and 2007.|$|E
5|$|Little {{can be seen}} of {{the levels}} now for <b>the</b> <b>entrances</b> were {{destroyed}} when the mine closed, but several spoil heaps remain, one covering the gill, along with the old miners’ path which zigzags up the hillside, a self-acting incline to lower ore to the dressing floor, and the old winding-drum house.

5|$|After the war, the Mimoyecques site lay abandoned. Much of the {{equipment}} left by the Germans was disposed of as scrap metal. A complete set of four steel plates, weighing 60 tons, that were intended to protect <b>the</b> <b>entrances</b> to the drifts were bought by {{the manager of the}} Hidrequent-Rixent quarries to be cut up for use in rock-crushing machinery. Rediscovered by local historians in the 1990s, they remained at the quarries until 2010, when the surviving plates were returned to Mimoyecques, where they are now on display.|$|E

5|$|At the Great Bitter Lake, the Egyptian 130th Amphibious Brigade {{performed}} its own crossing. Composed of the 602nd and 603rd Mechanized Infantry Battalions with 1,000 men, {{including a}} Sagger anti-tank battalion, an anti-air battalion, 20 PT-76 tanks and 100 amphibious armored personnel carriers, it was tasked with seeking and destroying enemy installations at <b>the</b> <b>entrances</b> of the Gedy and Mitla Passes. The sand rampart {{that lined the}} entire Suez Canal {{did not exist in}} the Bitter Lakes, and there were no Israeli defences or units to be encountered, and the brigade reached the opposite bank around 14:40 without any losses. The Egyptians discovered a minefield blocking their advance, and military engineers worked to clear a path.|$|E
5|$|Both entrances {{will feature}} the glass canopy design, {{the first of}} their kind in the subway system. They are {{intended}} to stand out aesthetically. <b>The</b> <b>entrances</b> are interweaved with the Hudson Yards developments, with the main entrance wedged between 50 Hudson Yards {{to the east and}} 55 Hudson Yards to the west. The rest of the Hudson Yards development is located very close to the south of the station. Both entrances are based on a design by architect Toshiko Mori, which itself is based on the design of smaller station entrances in the Paris Métro.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dam, <b>the</b> <b>entrances</b> to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels. The inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works. The inner tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to drain the tunnels for maintenance.|$|E

5|$|Important {{buildings}} {{include the}} Roman Baths; neoclassical architect Robert Adam's Pulteney Bridge, {{based on an}} unused design for the Rialto Bridge in Venice; and Bath Abbey in the city centre, founded in 1499 {{on the site of}} an 8th-century church. Of equal importance are the residential buildings designed and built into boulevards and crescents by the Georgian architects John Wood, the Elder and his son John Wood, the Younger– well-known examples being the Royal Crescent, built around 1770, and The Circus, built around 1760, where each of the three curved segments faces one of <b>the</b> <b>entrances,</b> ensuring that there is always a classical facade facing the entering visitor.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, {{some time}} after they {{had taken over the}} Sikhs' territory, the British {{developed}} the mine further. They found the mining to have been inefficient, with irregular and narrow tunnels and entrances that made the movement of labourers difficult and dangerous. The supply of water inside the mine was poor, and there was no storage facility for the mined salt. The only road to the mine was over difficult, rocky terrain. To address these problems the government levelled the road, built warehouses, provided a water supply, improved <b>the</b> <b>entrances</b> and tunnels, and introduced a better mechanism for excavation of salt. Penalties were introduced to control salt smuggling.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the MTA filed {{to change}} the {{location}} of Entrance 1, moving it onto from the sidewalk, away from its original proposed location inside 301 East 69th Street. This was because designs for entrances inside the building failed to both satisfy the building's residents as well as meet the MTA's engineering requirements. With the New York City Department of Transportation planning a bike lane along {{the east side of}} Second Avenue after construction is finished, the MTA could widen the sidewalk to make room for <b>the</b> <b>entrances</b> without ultimately disrupting traffic flow.|$|E
