30|$|Recently, a {{cohesive}} zone model (CZM) modelling methodology {{has been shown}} to be a versatile approach to predict the durability of adhesively bonded joints exposed to humid environments [68, 164, 180 – 183]. The accurate prediction of failure behaviour should be correctly implemented using a traction–separation law which includes triangular, trapezoidal and exponential shape [184, 185]. The parameters that principally define the traction–separation response are the cohesive fracture energy and the critical traction of the adhesive in each fracture mode. A proper selection of traction–separation law behavior is important. For example, a <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>law</b> predict more accurate for temperature variation in the joint [68, 183]. As the moisture concentration adversely influences the cohesive properties, moisture-dependent cohesive properties are required to accurately predict the failure behavior of a saturated or unsaturated adhesively bonded joint using the cohesive zone approach.|$|E

This law is first used for the description of the pure Mode I (opening) and pure Mode II (sliding) loading and fracture and then it is integrated into a developed mixed-mode model in order to account for the dependence of the separate pure mode laws. The traction increasing part of the law is described by an exponential function, whereas the softening part is described by a linear decrease. Prediction of damage initiation is established through the nominal quadratic stress criterion, whereas the damage propagation is established through the linear energetic criterion.

40|$|Hybrid {{composite}} materials {{are even more}} used in order to answer to the lightweight requirements of the automotive industry. Reducing vehicle weight to reduce energy consumption and local CO 2 emission {{is one of the}} most important goal required by the regional regulation of transport. On the contrary, the safety of the driver, of the passenger and of the pedestrian too is even more leading to increase the volumes of the vehicle. In order to improve the overall stiffness, strength and impact energy absorption of the body of a car, each part must absolve to different function and be designed with different mechanical properties. Another important topic related to the CO 2 emission and to the environmental safety is the end-of-life treatment that pushes on high percentage of recycling and re-uses. Thermoplastic composites are wide spread in automotive industry also thanks to their high processability and their easier recyclability in comparison to the thermosetting, furthermore they allow an increased design freedom. These characteristics made such materials a good candidate for metal replacement. Thermoplastic materials can be reinforced with various kinds of fillers, whether they are continuous and discontinuous, short or long. The reinforcing fibers play an important role in the diversification of the properties of the material and therefore of the part that they constitute. For example, the impact properties are strongly related to the length of the reinforcement, while the tensile strength and the elastic modulus are less sensitive. When the properties offered by thermoplastic {{composite materials}} cannot be further increased, plastic composites, thanks to their high specific performances, are combined with other materials in the final part by means of junctures that are based on different adhesion mechanisms. In the last decade, several technologies that incorporate the injection molding process were proposed for manufacturing of hybrid parts. The main advantages are the suitability for high volume production and for the implementation of the in mold assembly or joining. Polymer metal hybrids had been used to reduce the amount of bullet joint and welded connection. A sheet metal is used as mold insert where ribs are overmolded to increase the stiffness and other features are directly added for joining the part to the assembly. The adhesion between sheet metal and polymer is ensure by physical interlocking due to the roughness of the surface and undercuts. During the injection phase, the melted material fills the cavities and, after the cooling phase, it works as riveting system. However, treatments of the metal-side interface such as sandblasting, drilling, laser ablating and or plasma activation are required to improve the adhesion. Moreover, riveting joining could be added for secondary assembly operations. Otherwise, when thermosetting adhesives ensure the connection, the technology is called in mold bonding. The adhesive that can be one-part, such as cyanoacrylates, two-part, such as epoxy, or a hybrid mix of the two, is applied on the insert side before the over-injection. Its curing time must be consistent with the cycle time of the injection molding process in order to maintain the high productivity. Very recently, in mold forming technology, also known as FiberForm, Organomelt and Organo Sheet Injection, was proposed for manufacturing of full thermoplastic hybrid composites. An outer thermoformed shell reinforced with continuous fibers is internally stiffened with an over-injected ribs-system. This technology allows to directly coupling thermoforming and injection molding processes of fiber-reinforced material. The adhesion between parts is ensured by an interdiffusion of the macromolecules across the interface. The welding is based on the reptation theory and is promoted by the high process temperature. For semi-crystalline polymer, the overall degree of adhesion is related to the residence time of the interface at temperatures higher than the crystallization temperature. Furthermore, a good adhesion is due to the compatibility of the matrices. For processes that involve the injection-molding phase, the residence time is short and strongly non-isothermal. This means that the maximum adhesion strength could be lower than the theoretical maximum, reached at the weld line of short-glass reinforced part that is equal to the matrix strength. Moreover, even if a good welding takes place, the weaker zone moves to the laminate side at the interface between the matrix and the glass-woven reinforcement. The direct consequence is a weaker zone at the welding area that could be subjected to delamination failure. Delamination of composite interfaces is commonly simulated with the cohesive zone model proposed many years ago by Dugdale and deepened by Barrenblatt. The cohesive law, which is based on a stress-opening relationship, describes the damage phenomenon at the interface. Various kinds of fracture can be described with dedicated cohesive law that requires a calibration on the experimental data. Linear law, also known as triangular law, is used for brittle fracture; exponential law or <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>law</b> are more suitable for ductile fracture; bi-triangular law is used to describe the fracture in composite materials where the fiber pullout becomes significant after the damage initiation and made the opening slighter. On the base of what was previously highlighted, a good design of the part is required to justify the financial investment on the processing chain. Especially in the processes that are based on the injection molding process and are strongly volume sensitive, creating pre-series is time and cost consuming. However, in very recent time, new technologies for individualized or tailored production are under development. For example, the “LightFlex” project, which is funded by the Federal Ministry for Education and Research in Germany, is aimed to replace use of injection-molded components with components produced via additive production. 3 D-printing permits parts to be customized to meet virtually any requirements and to be provided with the capability to perform any specified function prior to being joined to a thermoplastic fiber composite material in order to achieve the required level of load capacity. The two half-molds are constituted by the 3 -D printed part and from the silicon membrane of the pressure-chambre that is aimed to form the organosheet. The welding between parts can take place after local heating of the interdace up to the melting temperature. Although the good idea, the project is still ongoing and also in this case, the adhesion between parts play a challenging role. The only alternative to define the performance of the part is to optimize the finite element simulation. For this reason, the definition of the boundary condition as well the definition of the interface strength became of fundamental importance. However, increasing the welding strength pushes toward a better global performance of the part. ...|$|E

Thus, adhesive bonding techniques have been largely employed, which also enables the combined use of steel with lighter materials such as aluminium or high strength composites.

This work experimentally evaluates by the J-integral/direct method the tensile and shear CZM laws of three adhesives with distinct ductility.

Though shearing is the main contributor to damage initiation in adhesive, stress analysis shows that lateral deformation subsequently reverses the distribution of normal stresses which stimulates patch debonding {{at one of the}} repair sides. The influence of patch dimensions on strengths and failure mechanisms can be explained by stress distributions in adhesive and lateral deformation of repairs.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{employment of}} carbon-epoxy laminates in high responsibility and severely loaded applications introduces an issue regarding their handling after damage.

40|$|This {{study has}} focused on {{investigating}} the initiation, propagation and effects of damage in fibre-metal laminates (FMLs) specifically Glare® 4 B under buckling, postbuckling and high cycle fatigue {{through the use of}} novel numerical and experimental techniques. In terms of numerical analysis, a 3 D user-defined cohesive zone model (CZM) has been generated to simulate delamination initiation and growth in specimens under static compressive stresses, using the software Abaqus. The generated models have been validated using a comprehensive literature review in order to gather reliable mechanical properties for the Glare® material constituents. Following this, a modified cohesive zone model (CZM) based on a <b>trapezoidal</b> traction-separation <b>law</b> has been developed by the author to simulate damage evolution under high cycle fatigue loading. This model was implemented through a user-written VUMAT subroutine working through the interface of Abaqus/Explicit software. This model is able to simulate elastic-plastic interfacial damage behaviour and as such is suitable for ductile adhesives including toughened epoxy unlike bilinear cohesive zone models which can only accurately simulate damage in brittle adhesives. This makes it suitable for modelling any material interface which incorporates ductile adhesives. The numerical buckling results were validated using a series of experimental tests conducted on Glare® 4 B specimens containing splice and doubler features in addition to flat specimens containing artificial circular delamination manufactured by Airbus Germany, demonstrating the ability of the models developed to predict the onset and propagation of damage. Experimental fatigue tests were then implemented on Glare® 4 B specimens containing splice and doubler features manufactured in-house, to Abstract iii obtain fatigue life for these types of joints, with fatigue parameters extracted from literature on similar grades of Glare® used to validate the <b>trapezoidal</b> traction-separation <b>law</b> based cohesive zone model. Static tests were monitored using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) to provide full-field displacement data and Acoustic Emission (AE) for the detection and location of the damage using traditional AE analysis and novel Delta-T techniques respectively, with Acoustic Emission (AE) using traditional AE analysis technique being used for damage detection under fatigue loading. Finite element models were also generated to model the buckling and postbuckling behaviour of Glare specimens containing splice and doubler joints and showed good agreement with experiments in terms of in-plane and out-of-plane displacements. In experiments, artificial delaminations representative of those which could potentially be generated during manufacturing had a negligible effect on the compressive strength of specimens. Acoustic Emission (AE) was successfully used to detect and locate damage initiation and propagation under buckling loads. Of particular importance in this body of work are the implementation of a trapezoidal traction separation model to predict the initiation and propagation of damage in elastic-plastic materials such as the resin used in the Fibre Metal Laminate Glare under high cycle fatigue and the detection and location of this damage using a bespoke mapping algorithm for the interpretation of Acoustic Emission data...|$|R

[22] directly addressed the mixed-mode CZM laws of adhesive layers by using the mixed-mode bending (MMB) test. Gheibi et al. [23] proposed a new mode-dependent CZM for the simulation of adhesive joints, estimated by the direct method. This was accomplished by using DCB and ENF tests for the direct experimental extraction of the CZM laws (tensile and shear, respectively). The obtained laws were used to implement a simplified Park–Paulino–Roesler CZM. After deriving the mixed-mode parameters, the proposed model was implemented in Abaqus® (Dassault Systèmes, Vélizy-Villacoublay, France) and validated against experimental results of single-lap joints and scarf joints. The accuracy of the developed mixed-mode CZM model for was confirmed for different mode-mixity conditions. The direct method was also applied {{in the work of}} Carvalho and Campilho [24] to validate, with a mixed-mode geometry, tensile and shear cohesive laws obtained in pure mode. With this purpose, single lap-joints with different LO and adhesives were considered, ranging from brittle to ductile. To apply the direct procedure, the originally obtained pure-mode CZM laws were simplified to parameterized triangular, trapezoidal and linear–exponential CZM laws in order to evaluate which form fits better with the behaviour of each adhesive. The joints bonded with the brittle Araldite® AV 138 were best modelled by a triangular CZM law shape, mainly due to the adhesive’s brittleness, while the Araldite® 2015 results were best fitted with a trapezoidal CZM, considering that this adhesive has some degree of ductility. The behaviour of the highly ductile Sikaforce® 7752 (Sikaforce® from Sika®, Baar, Switzerland) was more accurately reproduced by a <b>trapezoidal</b> CZM <b>law.</b> However, irrespectively of the adhesive, for the analysed joint geometry (single-lap joints), the errors incurred by applying a less suitable CZM law shape for a given adhesive were always under 10 %.|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{structural}} adhesives {{have become more}} and more popular in the automotive industry. The main reason for this is the potential to reduce vehicle weight and cost by reducing the amount of rivets and bolts used in the structure. At the same time, the standards for passenger safety are high and crashworthiness has to be considered during the early design phase. Consequently, finite element (FE) crash simulation {{plays an important role in}} the automotive design process. Within this framework there is a need for numerically efficient, predictive models describing the rate-dependent response of adhesively bonded joints as structural adhesives are increasingly used in crash safety relevant components. Additionally, industry requires a straight forward model calibration procedure based on limited amount of simple tests. Cohesive zone models have in the past been successfully used to describing crack initiation and subsequent propagation in composite materials or adhesively bonded joints subjected to quasi-static loading conditions. This type of model can nowadays be found in all commercial codes. However, cohesive zone models dedicated to modeling crash by considering rate-dependent material parameters such as strength and fracture toughness are not yet available. In this paper, a physically-based rate-dependent cohesive zone model is presented. The model combines a bi-linear traction-separation law describing the peel response with a <b>trapezoidal</b> traction-separation <b>law</b> describing the shear response of the adhesive. The model takes into account four rate-dependent quantities: mode I (peel) strength, mode II (shear) strength, mode I fracture toughness, and mode II fracture toughness of the adhesive. The model was implemented into the commercial finite element code Abaqus/Explicit by means of a user-defined material. The model was calibrated for the crash-optimized adhesive DOW BETAMATE 1496 V using four different types of test at different rates of loading. The rate-dependent mode I strength was determined using butt-joint tests. The rate-dependent mode II strength was determined using compressive double lap shear tests. The rate-dependent mode I and mode II fracture toughness were measured using the tapered double cantilever beam test and the tapered end notched flexure test, respectively. The model was validated against experiments performed on adhesively bonded metallic T-joints subjected to different loading directions and loading velocities (up to 5 m/s). The numerical predictions showed an excellent correlation to the experimental evidence, both in terms of the qualitative damage and failure sequence as well as the force-displacement response...|$|R
