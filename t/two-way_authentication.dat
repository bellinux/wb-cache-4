In technology terms, {{it refers to}} a client or user authenticating themselves to a server and that server authenticating itself to the user {{in such a way}} that both parties are assured of the others' identity.

To address the insecure channel problem, a more sophisticated approach is necessary. Many cryptographic solutions involve <b>two-way</b> <b>authentication,</b> where both the user and the system must each convince the other that they know the shared secret (the password), without this secret ever being transmitted in the clear over the communication channel, where eavesdroppers might be lurking.|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} for security of satellite mobile communication networks to design an efficient access <b>authentication</b> process. A <b>two-way</b> access <b>authentication</b> scheme among mobile users, gateways and the Network Control Centre (NCC) is designed in this study. The authentication scheme consists of four phases: mobile users registration, mobile users management, mobile authentication and mobile authentication update. Furthermore, the Syverson-van Oorschot (SVO) logic is introduced to reason the authentication scheme to verify the security. This scheme highlights the authentication role of gateways, and decreases the authentication computation load of the NCC. The access authentication scheme can resist attacks from any side, including the identity spoofing, tampering, replay etc. The integrity of the transmission data is also protected. Therefore the security for satellite mobile communication networks is enhanced. This access authentication scheme is implemented on the developed satellite mobile communication simulation platform.

How- ever, caching of content also raises major implications in terms of legal acts and bills (e. g., data privacy, copyright), dealing with access control, validation scheme, and regu- lations (e. g., contractual obligation, legal restrictions).

Therefore, {{it is essential to}} secure data and regulate access. The latter, is gained by including access control mechanisms in the data exchange process, where a user requesting data must prove his access rights.
