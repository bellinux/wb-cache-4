Initial experiment results on a real project data set show that 1) few iterations of feedback result in significant increases both in precision and recall; 2) feedback methods in language model are generally more stable than methods in vector-space model in improving precision, but the latter is more effective and can get better precision; 3) negative feedback information {{plays an important role}} in <b>refining</b> <b>requirement</b> traceability...|$|R

The method integrates two existing approaches, SCRAM and CK theory. SCRAM provides the framework for requirements management, while CK theory provides a framework for reasoning about design and its evolution. The method is demonstrated with the definition and <b>refining</b> of <b>requirements</b> for the BioVeL web toolkit. The objective of BioVeL is to allow scientists to understand, run, modify and construct workflows for data analysis with minimal training using a web-based interface.

Using this method, the prototypes evolved from simple workflow execution enablers to include more complex functionalities for reviewing, modifying and building workflows in later versions.

40|$|Context. One of the {{challenges}} in requirement engineering is the ability using survey as a requirement-engineering tool towards the software to <b>refine</b> user’s <b>requirements.</b> For instance, {{with the development of}} the way of healthcare, many advances in technology transformed the way of healthcare. E-health application is one of the technologies. As more and more health information that is stored electronically, e- health applications have given rise to trust issue in the area of data sharing. Identified the relationship between trust and data sharing based on the survey method is a valid approach, but the current studies still do not give a definite guideline about how requirement engineering should use a survey method step-by-step to refine the needs of users’ trust into software attributes. Based on the mentioned situation in e-health, defining a method to design survey to elicit requirements is needed. Objective. In this paper, the aim of the study is to design a survey method for <b>refining</b> user’s <b>requirements</b> of trust in requirement engineering based on the current state-of-art. The paper present the research on data sharing in e-health application. Methods. This study presented an action research, which identified the way about how to <b>refine</b> user’s <b>requirement</b> of trust. Survey was the main approach to do investigation among the e-health applications. Three cycles of AR were conducted in this paper, and three versions of questionnaires were designed in the research process in order to identify the factors that affected user’s trust in data sharing in e-health applications. Results. Through the action research, I found out three factors that affected user’s trust in data sharing, then the factors were identified, analysis and summarized, and the relationship between trusts and the factors is describe based on analysis results of the collected data, which obtain from the improved questionnaires. To find out the relationship between trust and the factors help present the process that how to design an accurate survey to <b>refine</b> user’s <b>requirements.</b> Based on the process and results of the action research, the survey guideline to <b>refine</b> user’s <b>requirements</b> of trust is designed and described. Conclusions. Based on the results that obtained in this study, I designed a preliminary survey guideline for <b>refining</b> user’s <b>requirements</b> of trust.

In this paper, we present an integrative modeling framework for agent-oriented early requirements analysis; this framework implements goal-oriented requirement analysis. The integrative modeling combines visual modeling and formal modeling together. Extended i * framework is used for building visual models; formal specifications complement the visual modeling to define and <b>refine</b> <b>requirements.</b> Both visual and formal models are outlined through a practical agent-based system F-TRADE 1.
