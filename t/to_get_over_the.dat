5|$|Converting Campbeltown for {{the raid}} took ten days. She {{had to be}} {{lightened}} to raise her draught <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sand banks in the estuary. This was achieved by completely stripping all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three 4inch (100mm) guns, torpedoes and depth charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun with a light quick–firing 12 pounder (3"). Eight 20mm Oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level. The bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour-plate protection, and two rows of armour were fixed {{along the sides of}} the ship to protect the Commandos on the open deck.|$|E

25|$|On 24 December Hero wrecked off the Texel {{in a storm}} {{with the}} loss of all but 12 men of her 600 man crew. Grasshopper {{observed}} Hero ground, but too late to avoid also grounding. Grasshopper was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sandbank into deeper water, where she anchored, though striking ground repeatedly. She was unable to go to the assistance of Hero and within 15 minutes the distress signals from Hero ceased. Next morning Grasshopper observed Hero completely wrecked. Neither she nor the Dutch schuyts could get to Hero.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} physics, when a ball is rolled {{slowly up}} a large hill, it will {{come to a stop}} and roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top of the hill to the other side. However, the Schrödinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get {{to the other side of}} the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called quantum tunneling. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.|$|E
25|$|Captain Charles Fielding assumed {{command in}} June 1803. On 16 November 1803, Circe was sailing {{to return to}} her station on the {{blockade}} of France after gales had driven her into the North Sea. At 3pm she struck the Lemon and Ower sandbank. Although she was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bank, she lost her rudder and her hull started to let in water. By 2am on 17 November she was able to anchor and daylight revealed that she was off the coast of Norfolk. Several fishing vessels came out of Yarmouth to help. She took the captains of two of them on board as pilots, and towing their boats, sailed for the port. However, the weather had not improved and, despite her crew's efforts at the pumps, the water in her kept rising. Fielding decided to abandon ship and at 7pm her crew transferred to the fishing vessels. The subsequent court martial blamed inaccuracies in Circes navigation charts for her loss.|$|E

The wind on the coast was expected to have an influence on the race, while the two tight turns <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Guillaume le Conquérant Bridge with [...] to go, were potentially disruptive for the lead-outs ahead of an expected sprint finish along the quayside in Rouen.|$|E

Spence D. of IGN wrote that the song has an [...] "R swoon", similar to Rihanna's previous singles. In an interview with Margeaux Watson for Entertainment Weekly, Rihanna explained {{the meaning of the}} song's lyrics: [...] "'Rehab' is a metaphorical song. Rehab really just means we have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> guy. So we talk about checking ourselves into rehab, meaning we have to get over him. And we compare the guy to a disease or an addiction." [...] Watson further called the song a [...] "lovesick ballad".|$|E

500|$|Because of the {{successful}} media blitz, she quickly became a household name. In 1960, Mansfield topped press polls for more words in print {{than anyone else in}} the world, made more personal appearances than a political candidate, and was regarded as the world's most-photographed Hollywood celebrity. She made news on a regular basis, from dresses falling off, to clothing that burst strategically at the seams, to low cut dresses worn without a bra. Things started <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top, even by her standards, when she took charge of her own publicity without advice. According to Shiffrin, [...] "She became a freak."

500|$|Hagrid reveals to Harry {{that the}} first task {{involves}} dragons, and since Fleur and Krum's headmasters are also aware of this, and will surely tell them in advance, Harry informs Cedric as well. At the task, Harry has to pass a Hungarian Horntail to retrieve a golden egg that contains a hint to the next task, which he does by summoning his Firebolt broomstick with the Accio spell, and finishes the task tied for first with Krum. Ron and Harry subsequently reconcile, Ron now understanding the full danger of the tournament. When Harry opens the egg, though, it merely shrieks loudly. Hermione then takes Harry and Ron to the school kitchens, where house elves work. There, they meet a distraught Winky, who is struggling <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> loss of her sacking. They also meet Harry's old friend Dobby, who has been employed at Hogwarts {{to work in the}} kitchens; he is the only known house elf to appreciate his freedom, despite his hardworking nature.|$|E
500|$|The {{new series}} on ITV saw {{a change in}} format, confronting the main fashion issues in Britain.

She stated that it took her four days <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sight of herself aged so drastically, and compared the feeling to having an [...] "electric shock". Broadcasting was scheduled for 7 November 2007 and the programme is newly entitled Trinny & Susannah Undress The Nation. On 5 November and 28 December 2007 Constantine and Woodall appeared on Good Morning America and performed makeovers on three women for the show and gave style advice according to the women's shapes. They also reported on the fashion at the 80th Academy Awards especially for the show in 2008. Constantine and Woodall have dressed over 5,000 women as of 2007. With reference to their personal website, they state that their satisfaction remains with the many women they have helped and inspired and not so much with the success of book sales and viewing figures.|$|E

I'm bound to say that, now that what the poet chappie calls the first fine frenzy has been on the ice for awhile and I am able to consider the thing calmly, I am deuced glad we didn't. She was one of those strong-minded girls, and I hate to think of what she would have done to me.|$|R

[...] It was later confirmed by Channel 4 that Lister's character would be involved in a sexual relationship with Sarah during the new late night series Hollyoaks Later. After the screening of the scenes, Lister explained: [...] "It was quite nerve-wracking actually as I'm good friends with Loui — it's quite a strange thing to smooch a really good friend so we had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> giggles and think 'right, just do it!'" [...] Also commenting on her worries about the scenes, she said: [...] "I thought it was hilarious! I thought it'd be interesting, though. I was obviously quite worried about them. Loui [...] and I chatted a lot when we found out {{that it was going to}} be in the late-night eps and we were wondering 'oh no, what does this mean?!' But in the end, they weren't graphic or anything like that, so it was fine." [...] She continued: [...] "It was completely mental filming them. Loui and I just had a massive attack of the giggles.

On the first day's run he was known to cover as high as a hundred and fifty miles, and after that he would average a hundred miles a day until caught.

2500|$|Army Group B {{attacked}} {{either side}} of Paris. Of its 47 divisions it had {{the majority of the}} mobile units. In fact, after 48 hours into the offensive, the Germans had not made any major breakthroughs. The Germans had been [...] "stopped in their tracks". On the Aisne, the XVI Panzerkorps employed over 1,000 AFVs, two Panzer divisions and a motorised division against the French. The assault was crude, and Hoepner soon lost 80 out of 500 AFVs in the first attack. The German 4th Army succeeded in capturing bridgeheads over the Somme river, but the Germans struggled <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Aisne. Weygand had organised a defence in depth and frustrated the crossing.
