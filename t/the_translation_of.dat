5|$|Type I systems {{sometimes}} {{include a}} third component. In {{the case of}} the well-characterised hok/sok system, in addition to the hok toxin and sok antitoxin, there is a third gene, called mok. This open reading frame almost entirely overlaps that of the toxin, and <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> the toxin is dependent on <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> this third component. Thus the binding of antitoxin to toxin is sometimes a simplification, and the antitoxin in fact binds a third RNA, which then affects toxin translation.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the results}} of the Greek and Islamic {{influence}} on this period in European history was the replacement of Roman numerals with the decimal positional number system and the invention of algebra, which allowed more advanced mathematics.

Medicine was also studied, especially in southern Italy, where Islamic medicine influenced the school at Salerno.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of his}} {{endeavour}} {{to expose}} the public to more foreign-language works, Johnson facilitated <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> educational texts, serious fiction, and philosophy (he was less interested in translating popular novels). In particular, he promoted <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> the works of persecuted French Girondins, such as Condorcet's Outlines of an Historical View of the Progress of the Human Mind (1795) and Madame Roland's An Appeal to Impartial Posterity (1795), which he had released in English within weeks of its debut in France. His publication of a translation of Constanin Volney's deistic Les Ruines, ou méditations sur les révolutions des empires (1791) quickly became a bestseller. Johnson also {{had some of the}} most prominent French children's literature translated, such as the works of Madame de Genlis.|$|E

5|$|In the 1760s and 1770s, botany became {{increasingly}} popular in Britain because of <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> Linnaeus's works into English. One {{of the most}} prominent books about botany was William Withering's Botanical Arrangement of all the Vegetables Naturally Growing in Great Britain (1776), which used Linnaeus's system for classifying plants. Withering's book went through multiple editions and became the standard text on British plants for a generation. The book delighted and intrigued experts, amateurs, and children alike.|$|E

5|$|Surprisingly, {{variations}} {{in the interpretation of}} the genetic code exist also in human nuclear-encoded genes: In 2016, researchers studying <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> malate dehydrogenase found that in about 4% of the mRNAs encoding this enzyme the stop codon is naturally used to encode the amino acids tryptophan and arginine. This type of recoding is induced by a high-readthrough stop codon context and it is referred to as functional translational readthrough.|$|E

5|$|A History of British Birds, Bewick's great {{achievement}} and with which {{his name is}} inseparably associated, was published in two volumes: History and Description of Land Birds in 1797 and History and Description of Water Birds in 1804, with a supplement in 1821. The Birds is specifically British, but is the forerunner of all modern field guides. Bewick was helped by his intimate knowledge of the habits of animals acquired during his frequent excursions into the country. He also recounts information passed to him by acquaintances and local gentry, and that obtained in natural history works of his time, including those by Thomas Pennant and Gilbert White, as well as <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> Buffon's Histoire naturelle.|$|E

The film, starring Jalaluddin Hassan and Adibah Noor among others, was released on 14 April 2011 in Singaporean cinemas.|$|E
5|$|A {{mitochondrion}} contains DNA, {{which is}} organized as several {{copies of a}} single, usually circular, chromosome. This mitochondrial chromosome contains genes for redox proteins, {{such as those of}} the respiratory chain. The CoRR hypothesis proposes that this co-location is required for redox regulation. The mitochondrial genome codes for some RNAs of ribosomes, and the 22 tRNAs necessary for <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> messenger RNAs into protein. The circular structure is also found in prokaryotes. The proto-mitochondrion was probably closely related to the Rickettsia. However, the exact relationship of the ancestor of mitochondria to the alphaproteobacteria and whether the mitochondrion was formed at the same time or after the nucleus, remains controversial.|$|E

In 1959 Cardinal Grégoire-Pierre Agagianian visited the country to see the Church's preparations. The KWI formally requested their own hierarchy in a May 1960 letter; this letter received a reply from Pope JohnXXIII dated 20March 1961, which divided the archipelago into six ecclesiastical provinces: two in Java, one in Sumatra, one in Flores, one in Sulawesi and Maluku, and one in Borneo. Semarang became the seat of the province of Semarang, and Soegijapranata its archbishop. He was elevated on 3January 1961.|$|E

5|$|Geometrical optics {{provides}} further matrix applications. In this approximative theory, {{the wave}} nature of light is neglected. The {{result is a}} model in which light rays are indeed geometrical rays. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, the action of a lens or reflective element on a given light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the optical axis, while the matrix encodes {{the properties of the}} optical element. Actually, {{there are two kinds of}} matrices, viz. a refraction matrix describing the refraction at a lens surface, and a translation matrix, describing <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> the plane of reference to the next refracting surface, where another refraction matrix applies.|$|E
