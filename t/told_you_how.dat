500|$|Over ominous keys, a {{keyboard}} opening and a repeating drum loop {{in the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings about how her relationship turned sour and puts all her cards on the table, [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> you hurt me, baby / But you don't care / Now I'm crying and deserted, baby / But you don't care / Ain't nobody tell me this is love / You're immune to all my pain / I need {{you to tell me}} this love / You don't care, well, that's OK". While singing the first and second verses, she pulls out the power in her lower register. Each time, her voice slowly builds until the commanding chorus is reached, where towards the end, she sings, [...] "la la la", in a muted saxophone line. Her voice expresses anger as she sings the chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé continues the [...] "wild-eyed pleas", as stated by Guerra and sings the lines, [...] "Even since you knew your power / you made me cry / And now every time our love goes sour / you won't sympathize". Her raw vocals then punch through most powerfully at the second chorus leading up to the bridge. After the bridge, Beyoncé, this time, scats the chorus alongside a multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E
500|$|Despite this, member Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes was the opposite. She {{threatened}} to wear black tape {{over her mouth}} on the song's music video due to her disagreement with its message and the choice {{for it to be}} CrazySexyCool lead single, partially because of the group's history of advocating for safe sex since their debut. [...] "I was totally, 100% against 'Creep'. I wasn't down with cheating on your man, you know, for me, it's be faithful. Trust me, I fought against that single coming out. You know, I was like 'If a girl is gonna [...] catch her man cheating,' this was my thing, 'instead of telling her to cheat back, why don't we tell her [...] just leave,'" [...] she shared. In the end, Lopes eventually capitulated, stating: [...] "If some people can creep, and in their minds, they can feel better by going out doing the same thing... Fine. I'm just not one of those people." [...] She instead added her new rap verse on remixed versions of the song, which talks about the consequences of cheating. Thomas later thought the song and the video's choreography routine were [...] "cool" [...] enough to distract people from its lyrical content and [...] "just sing along." [...] "Even the song 'Creep'—not that we creep, but if we did, [...] for a woman that would do such a thing. I say just leave his ass, but if you're not ready to just jet at the moment, then you know, I guess we <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to [...] We were really happy and we still are really happy to be the voice for so many women in so many different situations in their lives," [...] she told Myspace in 2014. Jon Parales of The New York Times stood by the song's concept, he wrote: [...] "The women sing about infidelity, revenge, status and power plays, not as victims but as contenders; when they're cheated on, they cheat, too." [...] Carol Cooper from The Guardian also described the track as the darker side of their [...] "giddy hedonism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Phaedrus and Socrates {{walk through}} a stream and find {{a seat in the}} shade, and Phaedrus commences to repeat Lysias' speech. Beginning with [...] "You understand, then, my situation: I've <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> good it would be for us in my opinion, if this worked out", the speech {{proceeds}} to explain all the reasons why it is better to give your favor to a non-lover rather than a true lover. Friendship with a non-lover, he says, demonstrates objectivity and prudence; it doesn't create gossip when you are seen together; it doesn't involve jealousy; and it allows for a much larger pool of possible partners. You will not be giving your favor to someone who is [...] "more sick than sound in the head" [...] and is not thinking straight, overcome by love. He explains that it is best to give your favor to one who can best return it, rather than one who needs it most. He concludes by stating that he thinks the speech is long enough, and the listener is welcome to ask any questions if something has been left out.|$|E
