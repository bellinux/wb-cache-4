5000|$|Many {{pressure-sensitive}} adhesives are a {{blend of}} rubbers (natural or synthetic) and a <b>tackifying</b> <b>resin.</b> Some acrylic adhesives also include an additional tackifier. Silicone rubber-based pressure-sensitive adhesives require special tackifiers based on [...] "MQ" [...] silicate resins, composed of a monofunctional trimethyl silane ("M") reacted with quadrafunctional silicon tetrachloride ("Q").|$|E
40|$|Tackifying resins (TRs) {{are often}} added to {{pressure-sensitive}} adhesive films {{to increase their}} peel strength and adhesion energy. In waterborne adhesives, the TR is dispersed in water using surfactants and then blended with colloidal polymers in water (i. e., latex). In such waterborne systems, {{there are problems with}} the colloidal stability and difficulty in applying coatings of the particle blends; the films are often hydrophilic and subject to water uptake. Here, an alternative method of making waterborne, tackified adhesives is demonstrated. The TR is incorporated within the core of colloidal polymer particles via miniemulsion polymerization. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined with force spectroscopy analysis reveals there is heterogeneity in the distribution of the TR in films made from particle blends and also in films made from miniemulsion polymers. Two populations, corresponding to TR-rich and acrylic-rich components, were identified through analysis of the AFM force-displacement curves. The nanoscale maximum adhesion force and adhesion energy were found to be higher in a miniemulsion film containing 12 wt % <b>tackifying</b> <b>resin</b> in comparison to an equivalent blended film. The macroscale tack and viscoelasticity are interpreted by consideration of the nanoscale structure and properties. The incorporation of <b>tackifying</b> <b>resin</b> through a miniemulsion polymerization process not only offers clear benefits in the processing of the adhesive, but it also leads to enhanced adhesion properties...|$|E
40|$|In the roofing industry, {{modified}} bitumen membranes {{are generally}} applied by torching {{with an open}} flame or mopping with hot bitumen or asphalt and cold adhesive. These methods can ensure a strong and watertight seam of overlapping membranes. However, mopping creates health and odor concerns while torching carries the risk of fire. Use of cold-applied, solvent-based adhesives is growing rapidly {{but there are still}} limitations associated with volatile organic compound (VOC) issues and longer curing times than torched or mopped systems. A growing demand for self-adhesive roof membranes, driven in part by insurance companies and legislation to increase the safety of the installation workers, stimulates the development of suitable formulations to improve the quality and expand the scope of these products. Although there are regional differences, premium self-adhesive roofing compounds are generally composed of multiple ingredients: bitumen/asphalt, a mixture of SBS and SIS block copolymers, SB di-block polymer, <b>tackifying</b> <b>resin,</b> naphthenic oil, oxidise...|$|E
50|$|The {{adhesives}} {{are usually}} clear or translucent, colorless, straw-colored, tan, or amber. Pigmented versions are also made. Materials containing polar groups, aromatic systems, and double and triple bonds tend to appear darker than non-polar fully saturated substances; when a water-clear appearance is desired, suitable polymers and additives, e.g. hydrogenated <b>tackifying</b> <b>resins,</b> {{have to be}} used.|$|R

40|$|The {{adhesion}} properties, i. e. viscosity, tack {{and peel}} strength of styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) /Standard Malaysian Rubber (SMR L) -based pressure-sensitive adhesive was studied using phenol formaldehyde resin as the <b>tackifying</b> <b>resin.</b> Toluene {{was used as}} the solvent throughout the experiment. SBR composition in SBR/SMR L blend used was 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 %. Three different resin loadings, i. e. 40, 80 and 120 parts per hundred parts of rubber (phr) were used in the adhesive formulation. The viscosity of adhesive was determined by a HAAKE Rotary Viscometer whereas loop tack and peel strength of paper/polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film were measured using a Lloyd Adhesion Tester operating at 30 cm/min. Results indicate that the viscosity of adhesive decreases with increasing % SBR whereas loop tack passes through a maximum value at 20 % SBR for all resin loadings. Except for the control sample (without resin), the peel strength shows a maximum value at 60 % SBR for the three modes of peel tests. For a fixed % SBR, adhesive sample containing 40 phr phenol formaldehyde resin always exhibits the highest loop tack and peel strength, an observation which is associated to the optimum wettability of adhesive on the substrate...|$|E

The {{tennis ball}} {{adhesive}} formula is optimized {{by studying the}} impact of reinforcing system, tackifier, vulcanization system and solvent {{on the performance of}} NR-based tennis ball adhesive. The optimizing formula of rubber is: NR 100, Carbon Black N 220 30, ZnO 8. 3, Stearic Acid 2. 2, Phenolic <b>Tackifying</b> <b>Resin</b> 3, Sulfur 3, Accelerator D 0. 5. The adhesive made through such optimizing formula shows good performance and the finished tennis ball has excellent adhesion and air tightness, satisfying the design requirements. Intorduction The excellent elasticity of tennis ball is provided by the internal air inflation. Therefore, air retaining of tennis ball is an important influencing factor of its performance, which is not only related with the air tightness of tennis ball bladder, but also closely related with the adhesion of tennis ball. The vulcanization of tennis ball is very unique. Firstly, it vulcanizes the rubber into two hemispheres and puts in inflating agent. Then, these two hemispheres will be bonded together for secondary vulcanization. This indicates that the bonding of tennis ball is the bonding between vulcanized rubbers, which is more difficult than that between unvulcanized rubbers. Therefore, firm adhesion requires experiment on the adhesive formula in order to gain qualified tennis ball adhesive. This paper optimized the tennis ball adhesive formula by studying the impact of reinforcing system, tackifier, vulcanization system and solvent on the performance of NR-based tennis ball adhesive...|$|E
40|$|Specific {{interactions}} in binary blends, models of hot-melt adhesives, of ethylene-vinylacetate copolymer (EVA) with different terpene-phenol {{low molecular weight}} <b>tackifying</b> <b>resins</b> (TPR) are first investigated by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) {{as a function of}} the composition of the blend. Molecular electron donor-acceptor (or "acid-base" according to Lewis' concept) complexes are clearly evidenced between TPR hydroxyl and EVA carbonyl groups. Quantitative data on the fraction of acid-base bonded carbonyl groups and the enthalpy of pair formation are then obtained. Secondly, the analysis of the interface between the blends and basic (aluminium) or acidic (glass) substrates by FTIR allows us to show the establishment and to quantify the strength of acid-base interfacial {{interactions in}} both cases. Finally, the comparison between the interfacial and bulk properties data and adhesive strength measurements (peel energy) leads to the estimation of fundamental parameters of adhesion science, in particular the acid-base component of the energy of adhesion and the number of acid-base interactions per unit interfacial area...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Tackifying</b> <b>resins</b> (TR) {{are often}} used to improve the {{adhesive}} properties of waterborne pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) derived from latex dispersions. There is a large gap {{in the understanding of}} how, and to what extent, the film formation mechanism of PSAs is altered by the addition of TR. Herein, magnetic resonance profiling experiments show that the addition of TR to an acrylic latex creates a coalesced surface layer or “skin ” that traps water beneath it. Atomic force microscopy of the PSA surfaces supports this conclusion. In the absence of the TR, particles at the surface do not coalesce but are separated by a second phase composed of surfactant and other species with low molecular weight. The function of the TR is complex [...] According to dynamic mechanical analysis, the TR increases the glass transition temperature of the polymer and decreases its molecular mobility at high frequencies. On the other hand, the TR increases the molecular mobility at lower frequencies and thereby promotes the interdiffusion of latex particles to create a skin layer. In turn, the skin layer is a barrier that prevents the exudation of surfactant to the surface. The TR probably enhances the coalescence of the latex particles b...|$|R
