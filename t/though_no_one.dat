5|$|As one of {{the larger}} towns in the French Basque Country, Bayonne had been {{one of the}} main bases of ETA {{organisation}} there. From 1975 onwards this had prompted a reaction from anti-ETA groups. In April 1975, Mugalde, a Basque bookshop in the town, was bombed, <b>though</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was injured. On 25 June 1979, Enrique Gómez Álvarez, an alleged ETA member, was killed by the Batallón Vasco Español (BVE), a right-wing paramilitary group active since 1975.|$|E
50|$|The most {{unconventional}} method however, {{was having}} the engineers lay landmines on the back trails, with the trigger points set back about 50 yards, thus ensuring that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> would actually get hurt. The troops got the message <b>though,</b> as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> wanted to take any chances with a commander who mined roadways.|$|R

5000|$|Dent {{was born}} in Oakland, California to a family of artists and {{graduated}} from Oakland High School. [...] "My grandfather was ambidextrous," [...] he says, giving {{a nod to the}} gene pool for his two-fisted talents, [...] "a cabinetmaker and an artist. My mother was a painter and always told me I was an artist. That's the heritage of the family." [...] <b>Though</b> <b>no</b> <b>one's</b> been able to verify it, Dent's grandfather insisted they are direct descendants of Titian, the Renaissance Italian master. He credited his mother and speed painter D. Westry with influencing his art. His style emerged after he painted a spontaneous portrait of John Lennon at a 1980 vigil. Dent married Ali Christina Flores.|$|R
5|$|In 1842, {{the young}} Danish {{archaeologist}} J. J. A. Worsaae disagreed the Haraldskær Woman was Gunnhild. A pioneer in archaeological stratigraphy, Worsaae presented evidence the Haraldskær Woman dated from the Iron Age. Later radiocarbon dating confirmed {{the body was}} not Gunnhild, but rather {{a woman of the}} early Iron Age who lived about 490 BC. <b>Though</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> proved the Haraldskær Woman has any royal lineage, her body lies in state in a display in the north transept of Saint Nicolai Church.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of November 21, 1970, a dynamite-fueled bomb {{exploded}} underneath the portico, doing $170,000 in damage. <b>Though</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was injured, windows were blown out, the Council Chamber (located above the blast) was damaged, all of the columns of the portico were damaged and replaced, and the Liberty Bell replica was a complete loss. A new bell was purchased for $8,000 and later moved to Terry Schrunk Plaza. No one was ever arrested or claimed responsibility for the bombing.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{moved to}} a small island in the Bahamas called White Cay for the {{beginning}} and end of the Isla Cruces battle, before production took a break until August, where in Los Angeles the interiors of the Flying Dutchman were shot. On September 18, 2005, the crew moved to Grand Bahama Island to shoot ship exteriors, including the working Black Pearl and Flying Dutchman. Filming there was a tumultuous period, starting with the fact that the tank had not actually been finished. The hurricane season caused many pauses in shooting, and Hurricane Wilma damaged many of the accessways and pumps, <b>though</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was hurt nor were any of the ships destroyed. Filming completed on September 10, 2005.|$|E

5000|$|On March 23, 2005 [...] {{there was}} a {{collapse}} of the underground garage roof and so it caused the most part of the square floor falling in.

5|$|The {{film was}} {{completed}} in 1981, but Paramount was hesitant to release the film out of continuing concerns that the film would be misconstrued. <b>Though</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> from the organization had viewed the completed film, the NAACP threatened boycotts. In early 1982, the studio finally held a preview screening in Seattle and later, in August, in Denver, with mixed responses. It was finally released in the US at five Detroit theatres on November 12, 1982 for just one week, with no trailer, no poster and no promotion at all. It did no business and was shelved as uncommercial by Paramount. Dumbfounded and hurt by the film's shelving, Fuller moved to France, and never directed another American film.|$|E
5|$|Flight 1 {{crashed into}} Pumpkin Patch Channel, Jamaica Bay, at 10:08:49, while angled at 78 degrees {{and on a}} {{magnetic}} heading of 300 degrees. Passengers aboard a Mohawk Airlines plane bound for Albany that took off immediately after Flight 1 watched the plane plunge into the bay. The jet exploded upon impact, a geyser of brackish water and black smoke erupted from the site, and the scattered debris and fuel caught fire. Long Island residents described hearing explosions which shook the foundations of nearby houses, <b>though</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> {{on the ground is}} known to have witnessed the plane hitting the swamp. However, a few men at Naval Air Station New York / Floyd Bennett Field saw the massive geyser of water rising above the hangars, and one guard—at his post on a bridge that the plane flew over—saw the plane roll over.|$|E
5|$|The first {{system was}} spotted over the western Caribbean Sea on June12. It had a single-point track. Another {{tropical}} cyclone was first observed over the northern Atlantic Ocean on August5 and {{also had a}} single-point track. On September14, the next system was observed over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Several hours later, the storm struck Florida, causing severe damage to crops. Strong winds and rough seas were reported by ships and on land, particularly in Maine. The storm dissipated on September17. That same day, another tropical cyclone developed over the central Atlantic. The storm capsized the bark Phantom, <b>though</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> drowned. The next hurricane developed over the Bahamas on September22, but caused little damage, despite its proximity to land. On October21, the sixth and final system of the season was first observed over the Bahamas. The storm brought coastal flooding to Nassau and Bermuda later in its duration, before dissipating on October26.|$|E

5|$|Though the Admiralty {{arranged}} {{for some of}} the ships to be salvaged, most were left {{at the bottom of the}} sound until entrepreneur Ernest Cox bought the salvage rights and began to raise the remaining ships in the early 1920s. Bremse presented particular challenges. She had come to rest perched precariously on a rock, which sloped away dramatically, causing fears that she might slip off and sink in deeper water. Cox's salvage team sealed her bulkheads and divided the hull into watertight compartments. The hull was patched up and an airlock fitted, but the team ran into difficulties with the large amount of oil which covered the wreck, more than had been found in any other of the ships salvaged previously. A three-man team using oxyacetylene torches ignited some oil, causing an explosion. The men escaped without serious injuries, and thereafter small explosions and fires were common over the two months it took to prepare the ship, <b>though</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was injured.|$|E
5|$|Verbinski did {{not want}} an entirely romanticized feel to the film: he wanted a sense of {{historical}} fantasy. Most of the actors wore prosthetics and contact lenses. Depp had contacts that acted as sunglasses, while Rush and Lee Arenberg wore dulled contacts that gave a sinister feel to the characters. Mackenzie Crook wore two contacts to represent his character's wooden eye: a soft version, and a harder version for when it protrudes. In addition, their rotten teeth and scurvy skin were dyed on, although Depp did have gold teeth added, which he forgot to remove after filming. Depp also used a genuine pistol which was made in 1760 in London, which the crew bought from a dealer in Connecticut. A number of swords were built for the production by blacksmith Tony Swatton. The crew spent five months creating the cavern in which Barbossa and the Black Pearl crew attempt to reverse their curse, filling it with five feet of water, 882 Aztec coins, and some gold paint on the styrofoam rocks for more impressions of treasure. The crew also built the fortress at Port Royal in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, and Governor Swann's palace was built at Manhattan Beach. A fire broke out in September 2002, causing $525,000 worth of damage, <b>though</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was injured.|$|E
