5|$|In July 2011 Lothian Buses {{introduced}} 60 new {{double deck}} buses. These buses continued {{with the same}} madder red and white pattern {{on the outside of}} the bus but Lothian Buses changed the seats to a matching madder red colour. They also changed the entrance to <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>to</b> a more wooden effect. Routes 4, 5, 19, 23 and 27 were the first buses to receive this branding.|$|E

Just before they leave, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) boards the bus with him in an attempt to impress his ex-girlfriend Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper). Both get cold feet 45 minutes into the trip, and force <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>to</b> stop. They then have Erin drive them home.|$|E

5|$|October 3, 2001: At {{approximately}} 4:15a.m. local time, a passenger, Damir Igric, assaulted {{the driver}} of his bus, attempting to slit his throat, and causing <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>to</b> crash near Manchester, Tennessee, killing Igric himself and five other passengers and injuring 32 others. Since the incident occurred {{three weeks after the}} September 11 terrorist attacks, Greyhound temporarily suspended all schedules as soon as the company learned of the incident for fear that it may have been part of a larger co-ordinated attack. After investigation by the company and the FBI, it was confirmed that Igric had acted alone and service resumed later that afternoon. After the incident, Greyhound bus stations increased security, though not nearly to the same level as airports or train stations.|$|E
5|$|Patrick gets on <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>to</b> go {{home but}} accidentally leaves SpongeBob behind. After several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to get}} on the bus, SpongeBob heads to a bus station and waits in a very long line. By the time he reaches the front, he finds out that the next bus leaves in 5 seconds; he misses it, then learns that it was the last one and he is stuck there until morning. He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming from off in the distance, and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking anglerfish creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon. The creature blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist, which allows him to rise up the cliff and float back to Bikini Bottom. The episode ends with Patrick {{on his way back to}} Rock Bottom, thinking SpongeBob is still there.|$|E
5|$|Writer Mike Scully came up {{with the}} idea for the plot because he used to live in West Springfield, Massachusetts and he would ask his parents if he could take <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>to</b> Springfield, Massachusetts and they finally agreed to let him one day. The {{production}} team faced several challenges during development of this episode. The animators had to come up with a special mouth chart to draw Bart's mouth with the joke teeth in. The pile of dead animals in the back of Cletus' truck originally included dead puppies, but the animators thought it was too sad, so they removed them. Scully used to write jokes for Yakov Smirnoff so he called him up to get the signs in Russian. Dan Castellaneta had to learn proper Russian pronunciation so he could speak it during the chess scene in which he voiced the Russian chess player.|$|E

Sitting 11 year exams continued as normal in Jersey in January 1941 with children taking <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>to</b> St Helier, talking amongst themselves in Jèrriais. The only change to the curriculum was the compulsory teaching of German as a language from January 1942, taught by local teachers to avoid German officers being sent into schools. Supplies such as paper, were short so slates were reintroduced.|$|E

25|$|In the 1950s, Glasgow's {{sandstone}} tenements {{fell out}} of favour with the planners, which resulted in new houses being built on the fields and farmlands in {{the outskirts of the}} city. Between the ages of fourteen and twenty, Connolly was brought up on a now-demolished council estate on Kinfauns Drive in the Drumchapel district of Glasgow, and would make the daily journey to St. Gerard's Secondary School (also now defunct) in Govan, on the southern side of the River Clyde. He rode <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>to</b> Partick, crossed the water by ferry and walked to 80 Vicarfield Street.|$|E
25|$|Only 7.5% took <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>to</b> work, using Adelaide Metro buses, {{the only}} public {{transport}} in the suburb. Normal routes into the CBD are by the 142 or 147 which both run into {{or close to}} the suburb. The 820/821 bus travels from the Adelaide Hills into the CBD along Greenhill Road. Buses typically run on 30-minute intervals during weekdays and one-hour intervals at other times. Unfortunately, due to the heavy emphasis on car transport in the area, the bus routes are limited and under-developed, particularly compared to the efficient public transit links {{to the rest of}} metropolitan Adelaide.|$|E

25|$|Cali {{is served}} by over 20 coach {{companies}} which gather in the Central Bus Station. The Station is centrally located near the old (now redundant) railway station, which serves now as Metrocali's headquarters.

Recently, in their last float renovation wave, Colombian coaches operators have opted for Brazil's Marcopolo buses. Informal stops exist for the short destination rides all along the way from Central Station to the town of destination.

25|$|During the 1910s, Fjellseter, {{close to}} the peak Gråkallen, {{had been one of}} the main {{recreational}} areas for Trondheim. On 20 August 1915, Millar and two friends were waiting for <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>to</b> take them to Fjellseter where they were planning to have dinner. When the bus never came, they decided during dinner in the city center to try to establish the tramway. The same day, he sent a number of letters to people and associations, inviting them to found a private company to build and operate the tramway. When he arrived back a week later from a trip to London, all the invited people had accepted. The first meeting was held on 3 November, and Millar was appointed chair of the committee.|$|E
25|$|As {{his celebrity}} {{grew in the}} late 1950s, he grew tired of being {{approached}} by strangers, and particularly disliked being visited by them at home. Another of his unverifiable stories had him keeping a suitcase {{by the front door}} so that he could claim to be just leaving, a practice he claimed to have abandoned after a helpful young man insisted on taking him to the railway station and had to be sent off to buy a paper so that Lowry could buy a ticket for just one stop without revealing his deceit. However, he was polite to the residents of Mottram, who respected him and his privacy; he used <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>to</b> get about the area in his retirement. A bronze statue of him was erected at the traffic lights in the village.|$|E
