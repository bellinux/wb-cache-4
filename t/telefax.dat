40|$|The most {{accurate}} {{way to get}} information on {{the mass of the}} MACHOs (Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects) is to use the method of mass moments. For the microlensing events detected so far by the EROS and the MACHO collaborations in the Large Magellanic Cloud the average mass turns out to be 0. 08 M_. Assuming a spherical standard halo model we find that MACHOs contribute about 20 % to the halo dark matter. The eleven events recorded by OGLE, mainly during its first two years of operation, in the galactic bulge lead to an average mass of 0. 29 M_, whereas forty events detected by MACHO during its first year give 0. 16 M_, thus suggesting that the lens objects are faint disk stars.

50|$|Fax (short for facsimile), {{sometimes}} called telecopying or <b>telefax</b> (the latter short for telefacsimile), is the telephonic transmission of scanned printed material (both text and images), normally to a telephone number {{connected to a}} printer or other output device. The original document is scanned with a fax machine (or a telecopier), which processes the contents (text or images) as a single fixed graphic image, converting it into a bitmap, and then transmitting it through the telephone system {{in the form of}} audio-frequency tones. The receiving fax machine interprets the tones and reconstructs the image, printing a paper copy. Early systems used direct conversions of image darkness to audio tone in a continuous or analog manner. Since the 1980s, most machines modulate the transmitted audio frequencies using a digital representation of the page which is compressed to quickly transmit areas which are all-white or all-black.|$|E

40|$|We all receive letters, ads, {{bills and}} invoices. While all this mail {{may seem to}} be increasing, it is in fact mainly the {{personalized}} advertisements sent by aspiring direc t marketers that we get more often, whereas many orders, bills and invoices have bee n routed electronically through redesigned business processes. By that, ordinary busines s mail have already been replaced by <b>telefax</b> and electronic data interchange (EDI), an d the same substitution effect will hit us customers as soon as companies switch to cal l centers and the Internet for electronic commerce. The objective of this thesis is to find out, first, the impact of the expansion of electronic communication on letter services and second, the most important criteria for selecting a communication mode. We focus on targeted communication, leaving out mass communication. More specifically, the communication modes studied are ordinary letter, hybrid letter, telephone, <b>telefax,</b> electronic mail (eMail), EDI and the Inter - net. The methods used are econometric modeling based on operator statistics and surveys based on user interviews. The results indicate that about 40 percent of 1 st and 2 nd class letter mail has already been replaced by electronic communication means in Finland, and the substitutio n process will continue at an increasing pace. The most important substitute so far has been <b>telefax,</b> but eMail is expected to take over soon. As a counter-argument against the substitution effect has presented that some electronic communication means, especially the telephone, actually has generated further demand for letters. Our result s show that this effect really has existed, but has tapered off during the last two-thre e decades. There is also competition between the electronic modes of communication. In particular, eMail has challenged <b>telefax</b> lately, indicating that the <b>telefax</b> machine i s reaching the peak of its life cycle. In the surveys users mentioned, the advantages of letter mail are still its data security, personal nature and legal capacity. In the case of electronic messages, there still i s some distrust as to whether they will reach the intended recipient and a fear that outsiders will gain access to them. A missing legal capacity, such as the lack of an electronic signature, seems to hinder the use of many electronic devices in targeted communication. A conclusion based on the results is that we live a transitional period before a radica l change in the field of targeted communication will take place. The hybrid network solutions and information services which make use of different digital networks simultaneously will be the prevailing trend. The postal service organizations can not slow down this development nor would it pay off Instead of relying on the survival of th e traditional letter mail services alone, the postal organizations should develop new hybrid communication services and through partnerships offer even purely electroni c communication service...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of larger technical systems {{relies on the}} coordination of autonomous action of a multitude of individuals and organizations. Institutional settings, often neglected {{in the analysis of}} technical development, help to achieve such coordination. Our analysis of international technical standardization in telecommunications highlights an institutionalized process aiming at the creation of compatibility standards as the means for coordination. Formal procedural, membership, and decision rules combined with informal sets of expectations constitute the normative basis of the CCITT, the most prominent international standardization organization in telecommunications. Although scientific, political and economic aspects can be equally important for standards, the CCITT selectively legitimizes a technical perspective. Political and scientific reasoning is restricted, an open economic perspective even completely banned, unless they can be "translated" into a technical perspective. This increases the capacity to proceed on a consensusal basis and often facilitates reaching a con-sensus in a controversy. Standardization of Videotex and <b>Telefax</b> empirically examplifies this, {{and at the same time}} demonstrates the limits of pure technical reasoning to resolve genuine political or economic conflicts. Die Entwicklung großer technischer Systeme hängt von der Koordination autonomer Handlungen einer Vielzahl von Individuen und Organisationen ab. Institutionelle Arrangements, oft vernachlässigt in Analysen technischer Entwicklung, erleichtern dies. Unsere Analyse internationaler technischer Standardisierung in der Telekommunikation behandelt den Prozeß der Vereinbarung von Kompatibilitätsstandards, die Koordination ermöglichen. Formale Mitgliedschafts-, Entscheidungs- und Verfahrensregeln sowie informelle Erwartungsmuster bilden die normative Grundlage der Arbeit des CCITT, der wichtigsten internationalen Standardisierungsorganisation in der Telekommunikation. Obwohl wissenschaftliche, politische und ökonomische Aspekte gleich wichtig sein können für Standards, begünstigt der CCITT selektiv eine technische Perspektive. Politische und wissenschaftliche Argumentation ist nur eingeschränkt zulässig, eine offensichtlich ökonomische Sichtweise sogar völlig unzulässig, es sei denn eine "Übersetzung" in eine technische Perspektive gelingt. Dies verbessert die Möglichkeit, auf Konsensbasis zu arbeiten, und erleichtert oft die Einigung in Kontroversen. Die Standardisierung von Bildschirmtext und <b>Telefax</b> liefert hierfür empirische Beispiele und zeigt gleichzeitig die Grenzen rein technischer Argumentation auf, um politische oder ökonomische Konflikte zu lösen.
