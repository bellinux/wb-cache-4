5|$|In the {{lame-duck session}} of 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Act, which allowed the {{president}} to terminate tribal governments, and broke up Indian reservations into homesteads for individual natives. Although the Five Civilized Tribes were exempt from the Act, {{the spirit of the}} law encouraged Weaver and <b>the</b> <b>Boomers</b> to continue their own efforts to open western Indian Territory to white settlement. Weaver reintroduced his Oklahoma bill in the new Congress the following year, but again it stalled in committee. He returned to Iowa for another re-election campaign in September 1888, but the Greenback party had fallen apart, replaced by a new left-wing third party, the Union Labor Party. In Iowa's 6th district, the new party agreed to fuse with Democrats to nominate Weaver, but this time the Republicans were stronger. Their candidate, JohnF. Lacey, was elected with an 828-vote margin. The Union Laborites and their presidential candidate, Alson Streeter, fared poorly nationally as well, and the new party soon dissolved. Weaver returned to Congress for the lame-duck session and once more pushed to organize the Oklahoma Territory. This time he prevailed, as the House voted 147–102 to open the Unassigned Lands to homesteaders. The Senate followed suit and President Cleveland, who was about to leave office, signed the bill into law.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{also took}} {{up the issue of}} white {{settlement}} in Indian Territory. For several years, white settlers had been claiming homesteads in the Unassigned Lands in what is now Oklahoma. After the Civil War, the Five Civilized Tribes had been forced to cede their unused western lands to the federal government. The settlers, known as Boomers, believed that federal ownership made the lands open to settlement under the Homestead Acts. The federal government disagreed, as did the Cherokee Nation, which leased its neighboring Cherokee Outlet to Kansas cattle ranchers, and many Easterners, who believed <b>the</b> <b>Boomers</b> to be the tools of railroad interests. Weaver saw the issue as one between the landless poor homesteaders and wealthy cattlemen, and took the side of the former. He introduced a bill in December 1885 to organize Indian Territory and the neighboring Neutral Strip into a new Oklahoma Territory. The bill died in committee, but Weaver reintroduced it in February 1886 and gave a speech calling for the Indian reservations to be broken up into homesteads for individual Natives and the remaining land to be open to white settlement.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} the concurrent {{validity of the}} Balance Outcome Measure for Elder Rehabilitation (<b>BOOMER)</b> with both <b>the</b> Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and gait speed. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Two geriatric rehabilitation units. Participants Elderly adults (N= 134) admitted to inpatient rehabilitation. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures <b>The</b> <b>BOOMER</b> consists of timed static stance feet together eyes closed, Functional Reach, step test, and the Timed Up and Go test. Validity was determined using the Spearman correlation coefficient, comparing <b>the</b> <b>BOOMER</b> with <b>the</b> BBS and gait speed on admission and discharge. Responsiveness of <b>the</b> <b>BOOMER</b> was compared with the BBS and gait speed for the change scores between admission and discharge using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Results <b>The</b> <b>BOOMER</b> demonstrated high to very high correlation with the BBS at admission (?=. 91; P<. 01) and discharge (?=. 89; P<. 01), and with gait speed at admission (?=. 67; P<. 01) and discharge (?=. 68; P<. 01). Change scores between admission and discharge for <b>the</b> <b>BOOMER</b> and BBS displayed moderate correlation (?=. 55; P<. 01), while those between <b>the</b> <b>BOOMER</b> and gait speed displayed only fair correlation (?=. 33 P<. 01). Conclusion <b>The</b> <b>BOOMER</b> {{appears to be a}} valid measure of the standing balance construct because it demonstrated high correlation with another measure of balance, and moderate correlation with a measure of a related construct (gait speed). <b>The</b> <b>BOOMER</b> may be a worthwhile alternative for more complex multi-item balance measures.

The United States sent troops to round them up and expel them. The raids continued for several years. <b>The</b> <b>Boomers</b> {{tried to get a}} legal opinion as to the status of the public lands, but the government, instead of charging them for illegal settlement of Indian land, charged them only under the Intercourse Act. Finally, in United States vs. Payne in 1884, the United States District Court at Topeka, Kansas ruled that settling on the Unassigned Lands was not a criminal offense.|$|E
