5|$|During the Sun Dance, {{which is}} practiced by many Plains Indian tribes, <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> is {{represented}} in several ways. <b>The</b> <b>eagle</b> nest {{is represented by the}} fork of the lodge where the dance is held.

The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.|$|E

5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want to be friendly. But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E

5|$|Vorenus and Pullo set off {{in search}} of <b>the</b> <b>eagle,</b> encountering and rescuing Octavian from his captors. Octavian thanks them and {{promises}} that they will be rewarded. Vorenus and Pullo discover Pompey's slave with <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> hiding in the bandit cart and kill him, realizing the bandits were hired by Pompey. A politically astute Octavian explains that their mission is only a gesture, since the theft of <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> is actually a blessing in disguise to Caesar. Civil war between Caesar and Pompey is inevitable, but Caesar needs Pompey to make the first move so as not to appear the aggressor; Pompey is likely to do that if he believes Caesar's soldiers {{are on the verge of}} desertion. The trio returns in triumph to camp, where a surprised yet grateful Caesar takes <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> back and more than adequate proof of Pompey's hostility. He sends Pompey the head of his slave and informs him of his next move, to winter the 13th Legion at Ravenna on the Italian border, in preparation for pressing his rights to the Consulship.
