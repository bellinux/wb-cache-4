5|$|Bart {{wakes up}} from the {{nightmare}} to find his family beside his bed. Marge assures him {{he has nothing to}} be afraid of, but a green fog seeps in <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> the Simpsons are turned inside out. They, along with Willie, perform a musical number over the end credits, but Bart is dragged away and eviscerated by Santa's Little Helper.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} scene, the nurse confesses {{to the mother}} that the child has been lost. Rover, also sitting in the room, listens before jumping <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> racing down the street, going around a corner and across a river. The dog makes {{its way to a}} slum and barges through each and every door; he finds the right one and enters. In an attic, the beggar woman is {{removing}} the clothing from the child; the dog enters and is driven off by the beggar.|$|E
5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
60|$|Dawn was {{breaking}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> dimming <b>the</b> electric lights. With {{the exception of}} the children, the whole family was gathered about the surgeon to hear his verdict.|$|R
60|$|The cock crew, and {{the night}} seemed to fade away into greyness. The first light of dawn broke <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> I pressed my love to my heart in one last kiss.|$|R
60|$|They obeyed in silence. Several {{stepped forward}} and raised the {{unconscious}} Harris, bearing him to <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> where they passed him to those without. Then they also retreated <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> room was cleared.|$|R
25|$|In January 1958 Switzer {{was getting}} into his {{car in front of}} a bar in Studio City, when a bullet smashed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> struck him in the upper right arm. The gunman was never caught. That December he was arrested in Sequoia National Forest for cutting down 15 pine trees; he was sentenced to a year's {{probation}} and ordered to pay a $225 fine.|$|E
25|$|John {{witnesses}} a {{plane crash}} on a freeway {{on the day that}} the paper predicted that a disaster would occur. He unsuccessfully tries to save several victims. He then learns that the remaining unexplained digits on the paper are the geographic coordinates of the location of each disaster predicted on the paper. Caleb has a vision of one of the strangers in his bedroom. He looks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> sees the forest outside his room ablaze, with animals running from the fire.|$|E
25|$|The curtain rises on a girl's bedroom. The Young Girl {{comes into}} the room dressed in a white bonnet and ball gown. She has {{returned}} to her home after her first ball. She holds a rose as a souvenir of the evening. She drops into a chair and falls asleep. The rose falls from her fingers to the floor. The Spirit of the Rose is seen at the window. He steps to the floor and nears The Young Girl. Still asleep, she rises and dances with him. He leads her back to the chair, kisses her, then leaps <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> into the night. The Young Girl awakes and rises. She picks up the rose she dropped and kisses it. The curtain falls.|$|E

50|$|David's {{painting}} also {{portrays the}} monk Dom Gerle alongside the Protestant pastor Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Étienne, symbolising {{a new era}} of religious tolerance. <b>The</b> wind blowing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> billowing <b>the</b> curtains also symbolises the wind of Revolution blowing through France.|$|R
50|$|During the end {{credits the}} video of the stalker's {{movements}} are shown {{from the moment he}} first spotted the group on the highway, following them to the house, filming them <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> while they sleep. Many of the close up shots focus solely on Cassy.|$|R
25|$|Weeks later, on {{his first}} day back at the office, excited to see his story in print, Pabst arrives empty-handed and informs them the whole month's run of the {{magazine}} has been pulped, as the owner wouldn't publish a story featuring a black hero. Pabst tells Benny he is being forced to fire him as well. Benny breaks down; he screams that although the world can deny him, they cannot destroy his ideas and the future he envisions is real. He collapses to the floor sobbing and is taken away by an ambulance. As he falls unconscious, he looks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and,</b> rather than the city, sees stars streaking past. The preacher sits by him and tells him that he is both the dreamer and the dream. Sisko wakes up back on the station. He is deeply moved by his vision, and wonders if somewhere Benny Russell is dreaming of Deep Space Nine.|$|E
25|$|Together with Agatha, {{he begins}} investigating. They {{discover}} a viscous substance {{left behind by}} the killer that the Doctor identifies as morphic residue. He concludes that the murderer is an alien in human form. The Doctor and Agatha question the guests while Donna searches the bedrooms for clues. While searching, Donna hears a strange buzzing noise. Opening the curtains, she sees, instead of a harmless, trapped bee like she expected, there is a ridiculously gigantic wasp outside. It smashes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> attacks Donna, but she fights back with light from a magnifying glass and it embeds its sting in the door but escapes through the window before the Doctor and Agatha arrive. The Doctor examines the wasp's sting embedded in the door, and collects a honey like-substance from the sting. The alien kills the housekeeper, Miss Chandrakala, by crushing her with a gargoyle, and the Doctor, Donna, and Agatha chase it but it returns to human form before they catch it. When they regroup in the study, the Doctor deduces that the creature is a Vespiform, an extraterrestrial wasp species that lives in the Silfrax Galaxy. Suddenly, the Doctor is poisoned with cyanide in lemonade laced with bitter almonds. His Time Lord physiology allows him to detoxify, with Donna's help. The poisoning inspires him to add pepper to the dinner meal, since the piperine in it would act as an insecticide. As they eat, the guests hear the wasp but the lights in the room are blown out before the alien's identity is revealed. When the lights are restored, they discover that Lady Eddison's necklace has been stolen and that her son Roger has been stabbed in the back with a bread knife.|$|E
500|$|After being knifed in {{the back}} by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) in the third season finale, Naomi uses her {{satellite}} phone to call George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) on the freighter. [...] Before she dies, she tells him that her injury was an accident and to give her love to her sister. [...] Meanwhile, Hurley finds Jacob's cabin. [...] He looks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> sees an unidentified man in a rocking chair, before someone {{steps up to the}} glass, only the left eye visible. [...] Hurley runs away, but finds the cabin again—in a different location. [...] He squeezes his eyes shut and when he opens them, the building is gone and Locke appears.|$|E
50|$|In the wintertime, {{the solar}} {{protection}} will let <b>the</b> sun stream <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> heat <b>the</b> classroom {{by increasing the}} ambient temperature. Furthermore, with an adequate insulation system applied in particular {{on the roof and}} the walls, a temperature included in the comfort zone of the occupants should be reached.|$|R
60|$|She moved restlessly away. There was {{something}} spectral {{about her in}} her light muslin frock, as she vanished <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> reappeared almost immediately, threading her way amongst the flower beds. Suddenly the telephone bell at Mr. Foley's elbow rang. He raised the receiver. She came swiftly to his side.|$|R
50|$|Resident Evil {{is often}} cited as the first video game to use jump scares. The player, {{during the course of}} <b>the</b> game, walks <b>through</b> a hallway where the music begins to lower. About halfway <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hall, zombie dogs will {{suddenly}} leap <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> music will peak in volume and intensity.|$|R
500|$|Back in Oak Brook, Mulder has {{followed}} Pincus {{to the house}} of VinylRight employee Gretchen Starns. [...] Mulder looks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> sees the monster leaning over the woman as she watches TV. [...] Mulder breaks the window and then kicks in the door. Inside the house he sees that Starns has been transformed into a zombie. Behind him, out of his sight, the monster walks across the ceiling. Mulder catches a glimpse of it crawling up the outside of the house. Later at the FBI office, Starns and Pincus complain to A.D. Skinner about Mulder's behavior. Mulder, seeing Pincus begin to transform into the creature again, draws his weapon. He is restrained by a disbelieving Skinner and then sedated in a hospital.|$|E
500|$|Daniels was {{especially}} {{proud of the}} wedding scene, which has a funeral procession visible <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> was difficult to light properly. Greed has often been praised for its use of deep-focus cinematography, seventeen years before its more-famous application in Citizen Kane. Daniels sometimes used incandescent lights instead of studio arc lights, due to the constraints of his locations. He later said that Stroheim [...] "was {{one of the first}} to insist on no make-up for men, on real paint on the walls which were shiny, real glass in the windows, pure white on sets and in costumes... everything up to then had been painted a dull brown" [...] to mask the scratches on worn-down film prints. Although not officially credited, Ernest B. Schoedsack worked on the picture as a camera operator.|$|E
500|$|McAlister replied, [...] "I am {{a better}} captain than Trumper, Armstrong and {{yourself}} put together. [...] You {{are the worst}} captain I have ever seen." [...] Hill then warned McAlister to stop insulting him but McAlister repeated the remark. Losing control, Hill struck McAlister a blow across the face. [...] The two then grappled for around ten minutes. Blood was drawn, staining their clothes and splashing on the other men present, Iredale and secretary Sydney Smith. [...] At one stage, fearing that one or both combatants would fall <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> onto the street, Smith grabbed hold of Hill's coat-tails. [...] The fight ended with a bloody McAlister {{lying on the floor}} and Hill, unmarked, standing over him. [...] Hill told Smith he could no longer work with McAlister. Smith then asked Hill to put his resignation in writing and the Board accepted it that evening.|$|E
60|$|I {{crossed the}} street, {{and looked up}} again at the house from the {{pavement}} opposite. Then lingered a little, listening to the music as it reached me <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> imagining to myself Margaret's occupation at that moment. After this, I turned away; and set forth eastward on my walk, careless in which direction I traced my steps.|$|R
60|$|I {{was able}} in a moment's lull to peer <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> see <b>the</b> dim lights of Capri--the glimmer of Anacapri {{up on the}} black shadow--the lighthouse. We had passed the island. In {{the midst of the}} babel I sent out a few {{thoughts}} to a few people on the island. Then I had to come back.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} sure of that, sir. No one {{came out of}} either of the doors, and {{there were only three}} who tried to bolt <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> we {{accounted}} for them all. Perhaps that chap who is prisoner can tell you where to find the captain. It's a bad job, indeed, if he has escaped." ...|$|R
500|$|Concerned {{about the}} children's education, Ms. Ellen reveals she will buy {{dinner for the}} winner of a {{spelling}} test. The boys actively try to court Ms. Ellen, but Chef (having beaten them to it) warns them she is a lesbian and thus only likes other lesbians. The boys do not realise what this means and try to become lesbians {{in order to attract}} Ms. Ellen. Meanwhile, Mr. Garrison's nose job makes him a [...] "hot and sexy" [...] man, with his face resembling David Hasselhoff, and he decides to quit teaching to pursue women. Stan wins the dinner (much to Wendy's dismay), but finds out that Ms. Ellen has no intention of making love with him. Wendy however sees them <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> leaves distraught. The next day, several Iraqi men burst into the classroom and declare that Ms. Ellen is actually an Iraqi fugitive. As she resists arrest, she inadvertently kills Kenny by impaling him with a sword to his face. The soldiers take her into custody and shoot her {{into the center of the}} Sun via a rocket.|$|E
500|$|Michael {{passes out}} and remembers events shortly {{before and after}} the crash; Hannah and Rex are singing the Queen song, [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody". Later, Michael meets with Emma's father Joaquin (Carlos Lacamara) at a coffee shop to discuss the new baby, the mystery man appears to let Michael know that he sees the real mystery man <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> Michael chases after him. When a police artist (Chad Cleven) draws an image of the man, his real name is {{revealed}} to be Ed Hawkins (Kevin Weisman), another detective who took over Michael's spot at the police department after the crash, now working with Bird (Steve Harris), Michael's former partner in the [...] "red reality" [...] and his current one in the [...] "green reality". Michael meets with Bird and Hawkins and the latter says {{that he was one of}} the first on the scene of the crash and that he is sorry about Rex's death. Michael starts to believe that his son is really dead; he remembers the crash, yet again, with additional information. Michael realizes that Hawkins was trying to kill him in the crash. As soon as he figures out the situation, Michael wakes up with Rex and Emma; he is relieved to see Rex. After the carnival, Michael phones Dr. Evans to tell her what he now knows about the crash.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the trial}} had {{received}} national attention, Brownsville officials were expecting {{a large crowd}} of spectators and reporters in the courtroom. In order to accommodate them, the trial was moved from the 357th State District Court to the 197th State District courtroom. On February 25, 1994, the jury examined the evidence from the bullet remains, the motel records, and photos of Fischer's corpse. His brother Eric took the stand and described what he saw and heard the morning his brother was killed. He said {{when he heard the}} two gunshots, he looked <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> saw a white car driving away. A member of the Cuellar organization, Victor Moreno, testified in court and helped investigators connect the murder to members of the criminal group. He stated that Olivarez, Puentes Pizaña, and Palomares worked for Cuellar and were behind the murder. He also said he spoke with Garza about [...] "a murder" [...] in Brownsville, and claimed to have been with Cuellar when Palomares called him to tell him about the murder of [...] "a boy" [...] in Brownsville. Moreno allegedly gave money to Garza to but the gun in Dallas on Cuellar's behalf. After the purchase, Moreno gave the gun to Cuellar, who then reportedly gave it to the assassins. The defense stated that even if, for argument's sake, Moreno's testimony was true it was inadmissible because he was not involved in the murder. However, the court concluded that he was integral to the process that led to Fischer's murder, and admitted his testimony citing a co-conspirator hearsay exception.|$|E
50|$|Solar control - A {{properly}} designed {{shading system}} can effectively contribute to minimizing the solar heat gains. Shading both transparent and opaque {{surfaces of the}} building envelope will minimize the amount of solar radiation that induces overheating in both indoor spaces and building’s structure. By shading the building structure, the heat gain captured <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> envelope will be reduced.|$|R
50|$|About 130 IDF {{soldiers}} {{participated in}} the reprisal codenamed Operation Shoshana (after the three-year-old girl killed in the Yehud attack), which was commanded by Ariel Sharon. The IDF force arrived at the village of Qibya, threw grenades <b>and</b> fired <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> doors of <b>the</b> houses. Then blew up 45 houses, a school, and a mosque. About 60 civilians, mostly women and children, were killed.|$|R
6000|$|Every one in town took an {{interest}} in the refurnishing. The carpenters and painters who did not actually assist crossed the lawn to peer <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> exclaim, [...] "Fine! Looks swell!" [...] Dave Dyer at the drug store, Harry Haydock and Raymie Wutherspoon at the Bon Ton, repeated daily, [...] "How's the good work coming? I hear the house is getting to be real classy." ...|$|R
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a girl (a young Underwood) {{studying}} at home. Her abusive father arrives and asks her if she needs help. She declines his offer and starts gathering her things to leave the room, however; as she stands up, he grabs her arm. She manages to pull away and leave. Underwood stated that this scene had no script. She and the actor acted it out the way they thought it might have happened. Underwood revealed that she left the filming location with bruises on her arm- [...] "I had finger marks on my arm when I left {{at the end of}} the day, so I was like, 'Wow.' ... It was intense. I wasn't just imagining it, it was really intense." [...] As the video continues, the girl is seen standing in the middle of a cemetery, walking around and staring at the clouds as a thunderstorm forms in the sky. She runs back to her house through an old, destroyed yellow-brick road, similar to the one of Wizard of Oz. She enters the house to see her father sleeping on the couch, holding a bottle of alcohol. She sits next to him, recalling the times he let his drunkenness and anger get out of hand. She tries to wake him up but fails. She realizes that he has passed out. She looks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> notices the thunderstorm getting worse, so she leaves her father and runs to the cellar alone to protect herself. She's seen lying in an old bed and crying, as she hears the tornado coming closer, with her father still passed out. The next day, there are no traces of the house, and she calmly walks away.|$|E

2500|$|Ben is {{awakened by}} the posse's gunfire outside the next morning. [...] He ventures upstairs; the posse spot him <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> mistake him {{for one of the}} ghouls, {{shooting}} him through the forehead. Ben's body is thrown into a pile of bodies, laid next to the original zombie from the cemetery. After the credits, the bodies are all lit on fire.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the flames had {{dispersed}} much of the suffocating vapor, so that the trooper {{was able to find}} the door, and in its very entrance he was met by a man supporting the insensible Sarah. There was but barely time to reach the lawn again, before <b>the</b> fire broke <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> wrapped <b>the</b> whole building in a sheet of flame.|$|R
60|$|It may be {{that the}} makers of Noah's Arks know that their animals are likely to find their way into young mouths, and paint them accordingly. Certain it is that the common, weary next morning broke <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> found Black Sheep quite well and a good deal ashamed of himself, but richer by the {{knowledge}} that he could, in extremity, secure himself against Harry for the future.|$|R
60|$|The {{position}} {{was not a}} pleasant one. A heavy shower of water from above filled the air with spray, and with their heads bent down {{it was difficult to}} breathe. The inside planks of the wheel were so slimy that standing was almost impossible, and at the slightest attempt at movement they fell. Above, the flames were already darting out <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> sides of <b>the</b> mill.|$|R
