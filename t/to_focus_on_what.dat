5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of {{deception}} by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla he learned <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, Counseling at the Crossroads: The {{perspectives}} and promise {{of school counselors}} in American education, the largest survey {{of high school and}} middle school counselors in the United States (over 5,300 interviews), was released by the College Board's National Office for School Counselor Advocacy, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, and the American School Counselor Association. The study shared school counselors' views on educational policies, practices, and reform, and how many of them, especially in urban and rural school settings, are not given the chance <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> they were trained to do, especially career and college access counseling and readiness for all students, in part due to high caseloads and inappropriate tasks that take up too much of their time. School counselors made strong suggestions about their crucial role in accountability and success for all students and how school systems need to change so that school counselors can be key players in student success. Implications for public policy and district and school-wide change are addressed. The National Center for Transforming School Counseling at The Education Trust released a brief, Poised to Lead: How School Counselors Can Drive Career and College Readiness, challenging all schools to utilize school counselors for equity and access for rigorous courses for all students and ensuring college and career access skills and competencies be a major focus of the work of school counselors K-12.|$|E

According to Jim Calhoun, former president of Dockers, “The brand is going back <b>to</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> we do best: khaki pants for men." [...] Dockers is trying to boost the selling of khaki pants, {{as it is a}} declining product among consumers.

The sequel, Romance of the Harem (1873), incorporates tales based on palace gossip, including the king's alleged torture and execution {{of one of his}} concubines, Tuptim; the story lacks independent corroboration and is dismissed as out of character for the king by some critics.
