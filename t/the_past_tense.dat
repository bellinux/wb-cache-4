40|$|The master's thesis {{examines}} {{the meaning of}} <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tenses</b> used by Albert Camus in his novels The Stranger and The Fall {{and the possibility of}} their transfer to Czech. The present thesis takes a theoretical and empirical approach. The theoretical part provides an overview of <b>the</b> French <b>past</b> <b>tenses</b> and their meanings and deals with their functions within the narrative text. It also attempts to express the specific use of French <b>past</b> <b>tenses</b> in Camus's works analysed. The thesis does not omit describe the possibilities that the Czech language has to express <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>The</b> empirical part is devoted to the analysis of the existing Czech translations of the novels The Stranger and The Fall with an emphasis on capturing the meanings of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tenses</b> defined in <b>the</b> theoretical part.

40|$|Grammar {{plays an}} {{important}} role in language skills, such as speaking, reading, listening and also writing. However, in a real situation, the first-year students of senior high school who have learned <b>the</b> simple <b>past</b> <b>tense</b> still have difficulties in applying the tense when they are writing an essay, that is a recount text. Since <b>the</b> simple <b>past</b> <b>tense</b> is related with recount text, the students have to master <b>the</b> simple <b>past</b> <b>tense</b> itself; not only the rules but also the use of <b>the</b> simple <b>past</b> <b>tense</b> in writing. There were seventy-five students of YPPI I senior high school taken as the subject of this study. The tests given were about grammar, that is <b>the</b> simple <b>past</b> <b>tense</b> and writing, that is a recount text. The scores obtained were computed using Pearson Product Moment Correlation formula. The result shows that there is a positive correlation. This means that there is a correlation between <b>the</b> simple <b>past</b> <b>tense</b> achievement and recount writing achievement. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is accepted...|$|R

5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The Perfect verb form expressed {{the idea of the}} verb as a completed action, viewing it from start to finish as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the verb came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is often used in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tense,</b> however there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E

5|$|Christodorus of Coptus, an Egyptian {{poet and}} writer wrote a lengthy (416 lines long) hexameter piece of poetry {{inspired}} by {{the glory of the}} statues housed within the halls of the Baths of Zeuxippus. This poem actually consisted of a number of short epigrams (six in total), each focusing on one or a small group of statues within the Baths, designed to combine to form one work. While {{it has been suggested that}} the epigrams of Christodorus of Coptus may actually have been inscribed on the (bases) of the statues themselves, this is unlikely because of his use of the ekphrastic medium, and the presence of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tense</b> in the text.|$|E
5|$|Parish and Shaw did {{not mention}} what time of year the {{tradition}} took place on or its geographical location. They also made no reference to a sack concealing the person carrying the horse.

He also thought it noteworthy that they described the tradition using <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tense,</b> indicating that they considered it to be either dead or dying {{at the time of}} writing. However, Maylam believed that the information regarding the decline of the tradition was erroneous, because hoodeners were still active in St. Nicholas-at-Wade during the early twentieth century and various locals living in the area at the time could recall it taking place in the area back to the 1840s.|$|E

50|$|Pashto is a S-O-V {{language}} with split ergativity. Adjectives come before nouns.

In any of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tenses</b> (simple <b>past,</b> past progressive, present perfect, past perfect), Pashto is an ergative language; i.e., transitive verbs in any of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tenses</b> agree with <b>the</b> object of the sentence.
