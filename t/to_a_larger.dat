30|$|In {{building}} the KNN model {{the choice of}} k can strongly influence the quality of predictions: a small value of k leads <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> variance in predictions; alternatively, setting k <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> value may lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> model bias since the k nearest neighbours are farther away including cases that are less representative of the case under examination. Thus, k should be set <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> value enough <b>to</b> minimize the estimation error and small enough (with respect to the numbers of cases) so that the k nearest points are {{close enough to the}} query point.|$|R

At a meeting in Söderköping in September 1270, Archbishop Fulco Angelus and the cathedral chapter decided the site should be in Östra Aros. Formal authorization of the move was issued in 1271 by Bishop Carolus of Västerås whom the Pope had appointed to oversee the case.|$|E

5|$|Arkham Origins was {{considered}} an incremental installment for the series, rather than a transformative one. GameSpot said that Arkham City expanded on Arkham Asylum by applying the game mechanics <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> open-world setting, but criticized Arkham Origins for replicating Arkham City without moving the series forward. Other critics agreed, saying that the game's well-received elements from the previous game were not significantly developed or augmented and it was routine rather than inspired.

5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed {{on opposite sides of the}} horn and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{diminutive}} size, the Church of St Nicholas {{was probably}} not constructed as an independent church.

The larger church was perhaps pulled down during the early Ottoman rule of Bulgaria (post-14th century). While the Church of St Nicholas was not destroyed, its renovation was prohibited by the Ottomans, thus it gradually fell into ruin.|$|E
