5|$|Cicero {{translated}} Aratus in his youth; he {{made the}} Orion episode half again longer {{than it was in}} the Greek, adding the traditional Latin topos of madness to Aratus's text. Cicero's Aratea is one of the oldest Latin poems to come down <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> more than isolated lines; this episode may have established the technique of including epyllia in non-epic poems.|$|E
5|$|The peoples known <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians, {{began to}} arrive in Britain in the 5th century. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form in {{southern}} and eastern Britain, and {{by the beginning of}} the seventh century, southern England was almost entirely under their control. Tytila was a member of the Wuffingas family, the ruling dynasty of the Kingdom of the East Angles that was named after his father Wuffa. The Wuffingas may have been descendants of an earlier Scandinavian dynasty. Both he and his father are semi-historical figures.|$|E
5|$|What Bethesda had {{originally}} disclosed <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>as</b> an example: In {{that section of}} the game, there is a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet, when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, {{you can see that}} it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E

25|$|We {{welcome to}} the table, on {{individual}} grounds, each saint, not {{because he or she}} is a member of this or that gathering or denomination of Christians nor because they are followers of any particular leader, but on such testimony as commends itself <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> being sufficient. We distinctly refuse to be parties to any exclusion of those who, we are satisfied, are believers—except on grounds personally applying to their individual faith and conduct.|$|E
25|$|Hermeticists {{believe in}} a prisca theologia, the {{doctrine}} that a single, true theology exists, that it exists in all religions, {{and that it was}} given by God to man in antiquity. In order to demonstrate the truth of the prisca theologia doctrine, Christians appropriated the Hermetic teachings for their own purposes. By this account, Hermes Trismegistus was (according to the fathers of the Christian church) either a contemporary of Moses or the third in a line of men named Hermes—Enoch, Noah, and the Egyptian priest-king who is known <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> Hermes Trismegistus.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} said by some that I asked for too much. Perhaps so. You tell me -- what quality of {{leadership}} would ask too little? What sort of leadership would be content merely to maintain a standard of living that for so long has been so meager for so many? The shame upon me and my administration {{would have been in}} not struggling for something better. Today, I am not ashamed..... The most meaningful measurement of progress is that certain things are no longer acceptable <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> a people.|$|E
25|$|The anti-climatic {{nature of}} the eighth-century Irish tale then gains {{significant}} clarity {{in the light of}} the relationship between a horned or antler-bearing deity, warrior, or progenitor, and the chthonic dwelling, treasure-guarding serpent that encircled the waist of the one it chose to protect. This universal Celtic concept comes down <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> a mere echo of its ancient self through centuries of the Christianization of Ireland. The Gaelic Cernunnos may now possibly only be found in the slight similarity of a name and the peculiarity of a single passage from a Middle Ages Irish epic.|$|E
25|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{who initially}} read Kierkegaard, especially Kierkegaard's (written under the pseudonym of Johannes de Silentio) Fear and Trembling, often {{come to the}} conclusion that Kierkegaard supports a divine command law of ethics. The divine command theory is a metaethical theory which claims moral values are whatever is commanded by a god or gods. However, Kierkegaard is not arguing that morality is created by God; instead, he would argue that a divine command from God transcends ethics. This distinction means that God does not necessarily create human morality: it is up <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> individuals to create our own morals and values. But any religious person must be prepared for the event of a divine command from God that would take precedence over all moral and rational obligations. Kierkegaard called this event the teleological suspension of the ethical. Abraham, the knight of faith, chose to obey God unconditionally, and was rewarded with his son, his faith, and the title of Father of Faith. Abraham transcended ethics and leaped into faith.|$|E

25|$|The {{nucleus of}} an atom {{consists}} of neutrons and protons, {{which in turn}} are the manifestation of more elementary particles, called quarks, that are held in association by the nuclear strong force in certain stable combinations of hadrons, called baryons. The nuclear strong force extends far enough from each baryon so as to bind the neutrons and protons together against the repulsive electrical force between the positively charged protons. The nuclear strong force has a very short range, and essentially drops to zero just beyond {{the edge of the}} nucleus. The collective action of the positively charged nucleus is to hold the electrically negative charged electrons in their orbits about the nucleus. The collection of negatively charged electrons orbiting the nucleus display an affinity for certain configurations and numbers of electrons that make their orbits stable. Which chemical element an atom represents is determined by the number of protons in the nucleus; the neutral atom will have an equal number of electrons orbiting that nucleus. Individual chemical elements can create more stable electron configurations by combining to share their electrons. It is that sharing of electrons to create stable electronic orbits about the nucleus that appears <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> the chemistry of our macro world.|$|E
500|$|... “(…) their generous {{hospitality}} and simple and innocent mores reminded {{us of the}} beautiful period of pastoral life which fiction calls the Golden age, and seemed to present <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> real people the characters of Theocritus’ and Virgil’s eclogues.” ...|$|E
500|$|In 2015 three {{freelance}} journalists, James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and Austin Tice {{were honored}} with the award, {{presented at the}} National Press Club.

500|$|And {{concerning}} {{that letter}} which the most reverend and holy Æthelheard sent <b>to</b> <b>us...</b> <b>as</b> regards that apostate cleric who mounted to the throne... we excommunicate and reject him, {{having regard to}} the safety of his soul.

500|$|In a {{motel room}} in Roswell, New Mexico, Mulder and Scully prepare for bed and talk. Mulder {{explains}} his belief [...] "that the dead are not lost to us.

And if you and I are powerless now, I {{want to believe that}} if we listen to what's speaking, it can give us the power to save ourselves."

500|$|... "Lift Up Your Face" [...] is a {{southern}} rock song with {{a length of}} four minutes and twenty-six seconds. It is set in common time in the key of E minor and has a tempo of 88 beats per minute, with a vocal range spanning from D4-G5. The lyrics to the song portray a hopeful message of salvation and encouragement. Lead vocalist Mac Powell commented that [...] "The country is going through hard times, and there are doubts and insecurity. The message of 'Lift Up Your Face' is [...] message of encouragement – not just to listeners though - <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> well. It's a message {{we all need to}} hear".|$|E

500|$|Many reviews were {{critical}} of the film's resemblance to The Fly. British magazine Time Out later [...] pointed it out, as did TV Guide. Audiences also noted that it {{was similar to the}} 1959 science fiction film 4D Man. In a 2000 interview with Video Watchdog, Richard Gordon stated [...] "we weren't really influenced by The Fly" [...] and wrote in the 2006 book Interviews with B Science Fiction and Horror Movie Makers that [...] "Projected Man does have a very strong similarity to The Fly, but it came <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> a finished screenplay and seemed to be a perfectly logical film to make." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} story, then titled [...] "The Shroud," [...] {{was written}} by Joseph Stefano, who had previously worked on The Outer Limits. Hannah Louise Shearer was given the task of re-writing the original take. The first draft had Yar's death occur earlier in the episode with {{the main focus of}} the episode being the Armus creature rather than her death. It was the show's creator, Gene Roddenberry who argued in favor of her sudden demise as he felt it was suitable for a security officer. Roddenberry also argued against killing Armus in retaliation. Shearer later described the decision, saying [...] "Gene felt we couldn't kill the creature, because it is not up <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> human beings to make a moral judgement on any creature that we encounter, because we are not God".|$|E
500|$|Two years later, Queen Elizabeth II {{issued the}} 1988 letters patent authorising the {{governor}} general [...] "to exercise or {{provide for the}} exercise of all powers and authorities lawfully belonging <b>to</b> <b>Us</b> <b>as</b> Queen of Canada in respect of the granting of armorial bearings in Canada". These letters patent were presented by Prince Edward to the governor general {{on behalf of the}} Crown. [...] Subsequently, the Governor General, Jeanne Sauvé, authorised the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority on June 4, 1988. As a result, Canada became the first Commonwealth realm outside the United Kingdom to have its own heraldic authority. Canada also provides full equality to women in terms of inheriting and transmitting arms. Additionally, all armigers within Canada may file for trademark protection of their grant of arms under the Trade-Marks Act.|$|E
