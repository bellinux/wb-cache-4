A three-stage charge pump is applied to achieve 5 V to 18 V DC/DC conversion, and each stage uses the cross coupled charge pump circuit, taking body effect, threshold voltage drop and efficiency into account.

If the <b>protection</b> <b>temperature</b> is accepted as the key indicator of overall alloy resistance, then the resistance increases in the order: Alloy 625 (UNS N 06625) < C- 4 (UNS N 06455) < C- 276 (UNS N 10276) < C- 22 (UNS N 06022) ~ Alloy 59 (UNS N 06059) ~ C- 2000 (UNS N 06200) < Alloy 686 (UNS N 06686).
