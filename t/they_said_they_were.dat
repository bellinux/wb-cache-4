Subjects completed a Big Five personality measurement for "how they are" and "how {{they wish to}} be". After interacting in small groups either face-to-face or via IRC, subjects judged {{the other members of}} their groups along the same dimensions. Difference scores between the subjects' 'actual' self-rated personality, 'ideal' self-rated personality, and impressions of others were compared across IRC-Expert, IRC-Novice and face-to-face conditions. The sessions were logged, coded and analyzed across groups to examine the {{processes of}} self-presentation and impression formation as functions of medium, and of self-selection. Overall, subjects were judged more like how <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> actually <b>were</b> than how <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> wished to <b>be</b> across all conditions, for each personality trait dimension. Results partially supported the prediction that IRC-Experts are able to be judged more like how <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> wished to <b>be</b> than how <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> actually <b>were,</b> within the reduced-cues medium...|$|R

500|$|Various UK-based video gaming {{magazines}} gave Wonder BoyIII: The Dragon's Trap significant coverage. The Games Machine complimented the game's colorful {{backgrounds and}} sprites with [...] "the [...] Boy himself being particularly well-drawn", while they criticized the weak animation {{on some of}} the characters as well as its choppy scrolling.

The magazine praised the game's simplistic and addictive platforming gameplay and its smooth-scrolling graphics, though <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> [...] "a little blocky". They noted that the game had excellent music which was [...] "worth listening through some headphones". Zero, along with praising the game's graphics and music, called it [...] "enormously addictive"; the review said the ability to transform into different forms and hence being able to progress into new areas kept the game fresh.|$|E

The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named David Donato. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer Bob Ezrin in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after. Disillusioned with the band's revolving line-up, bassist Geezer Butler quit Black Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band. [...] "When Ian Gillan took over {{that was the end of}} it for me", Butler later said. [...] "I thought it was just a joke and I just totally left. When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album. After we had done the album we gave it to Warner Bros. and <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going to put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn't have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it. That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it." ...|$|E

500|$|On 22 August 1845, Governor Butterworth wrote {{again to}} the Government of India, {{indicating}} he trusted that construction of the lighthouse on Peak Rock would begin soon [...] "as a light in that quarters is becoming daily of more paramount importance". Between 1824 and 1851, at least 16 sizeable vessels were wrecked {{in the vicinity of}} Pedra Branca and Point Romania (on the Johor coast). However, in April 1846, the Lords of the Admiralty in London informed the Court of Directors of the East India Company they were inclined to think that Pedra Branca was the best point for the lighthouse. John Thomson and Captain S. Congalton, commander of the East India Company's steamer called the Hooghly, carried out surveys in May and August.

On 30 October 1846 the President in Council in India approved Pedra Branca as the site for the lighthouse. The East India Company gave its approval on 24 February 1847, and on 10 May of that year the Government of India asked Governor Butterworth to take measures for the construction of the lighthouse. There {{is no evidence that the}} authorities in Singapore thought it necessary or desirable to inform the Johor authorities of the decision about the siting of the lighthouse or to seek any consent for its erection.|$|E
