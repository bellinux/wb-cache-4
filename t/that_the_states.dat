5|$|Black was {{the author}} of the {{landmark}} decision in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), which ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> must provide an attorney to an indigent criminal defendant who cannot afford one. Before Gideon, the Court had held that such a requirement applied only to the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Black's {{majority}} opinion in McCollum v. Board of Education (1948) {{held that the}} government could not provide religious instruction in public schools. In Torcaso v. Watkins (1961), he delivered an opinion which affirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office. Similarly, he authored the {{majority opinion}} in Engel v. Vitale (1962), which declared it unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools.|$|E
5|$|Mountbatten {{used his}} {{influence}} with the princes {{to push them}} towards accession. He declared that the British Government would not grant dominion status {{to any of the}} princely states, nor would it accept them into the British Commonwealth, which meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> would sever all connections with the British crown unless they joined either India or Pakistan. He pointed out that the Indian subcontinent was one economic entity, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> would suffer most if the link were broken. He also pointed to the difficulties that princes would face maintaining order in the face of threats such as the rise of communal violence and communist movements.|$|E

50|$|Another {{study on}} <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> {{political}} ideology noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> conservatives were <b>the</b> most conservative {{of any state}} (more so than Utah or Tennessee) and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> liberals were more liberal than any state (more so than Vermont or D.C.).|$|R
25|$|Social conservatives argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> should {{maintain}} a moral outlook and legislate against behavior commonly regarded as culturally destructive or immoral, proposing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> cannot survive if its citizens {{do not have}} civic virtue.|$|R
5|$|On 11 January 1790, the United Belgian States (État-Belgiques-Unis or Verenigde Belgische Staten) {{was officially}} formed with a Treaty of Union. After negotiations, the delegates decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> should be unified {{into a single}} polity. A Sovereign Congress was created in Brussels which would act as a {{parliament}} for the whole union. Autonomy over almost all important matters, however, was still decided independently by the states themselves.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1865, {{two days}} after the {{announcement}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>States</b> had ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, Wilson introduced a bill to protect the civil rights of African Americans. Although Wilson's bill failed to pass Congress it was effectively the same bill as the Civil Rights Act of 1866 that passed Congress over Johnson's veto on April 9, 1866.|$|E
5|$|In {{clear and}} {{forceful}} language Floyd reasserted the state sovereignty theory of government, as {{guaranteed by the}} 'Compact or Constitution,' holding the Federal Government to be merely the 'Agent of the States' entrusted only with such powers as were originally intended to operate 'externally' and 'upon nations foreign to those composing the Confederacy.' He {{called attention to the}} disregard with which 'an unrestrained majority' had received the memorials and protests of some of the 'sovereign states,' justifying their acts by precedent and expediency and thus melting away 'the solder of the Federal chain;' also {{to the fact that it}} was then 'strongly insinuated' <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> could not 'interpose to arrest an unconstitutional measure.' Such a course, he was certain, could result only in nullifying the federal constitution and in a complete failure in our experiment in government.|$|E
50|$|The 2016 Kelly/Hickok {{study found}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Fair generates around $50 {{million for the}} area economy. This is in {{contrast}} to the figure of $600 million in impact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Fair itself has traditionally reported.|$|R
50|$|Anarchists believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> is {{inherently}} {{an instrument of}} domination and repression, no matter who is in control of it. Anarchists note <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> possesses <b>the</b> monopoly on the legal use of violence. Unlike Marxists, anarchists believe that revolutionary seizure of state power {{should not be a}} political goal. They believe instead <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> apparatus should be completely dismantled, and an alternative set of social relations created, which are not based on state power at all.|$|R
5000|$|In 1913, a local {{committee}} expressed concerns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> had purchased Pineland Farms solely {{as a commercial}} venture, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> location {{did not meet the}} needs of the Maine school. <b>The</b> committee suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> move <b>the</b> school to a better location.|$|R
5|$|Justice Harlan {{supported}} {{many of the}} Warren Court's landmark decisions {{relating to}} {{the separation of church}} and state. For instance, he voted in favor of the Court's ruling <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office in Torcaso v. Watkins. He joined in Engel v. Vitale, which declared that it was unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools. In , similarly, he voted to strike down an Arkansas law banning the teaching of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Madison {{argued that}} a state, after declaring a federal law unconstitutional, could take action by {{communicating}} with other states, attempting to enlist their support, petitioning Congress to repeal the law in question, introducing amendments to the Constitution in Congress, or calling a constitutional convention. Madison did not assert <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> could legally nullify an objectionable federal law or that they could declare it void and unenforceable. By eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion, Madison tried {{to make clear that}} the Democratic-Republicans were not moving toward disunion.|$|E
5|$|More generally, the Report {{made the}} {{argument}} in favor of the sovereignty of the individual states, for which it is best known. The basic message was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact, and that therefore the individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power. This doctrine is known as the compact theory. It was the presence of this argument in the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists to paint the Democratic-Republicans as leaning toward secession; in the amended Report the line is moderated, with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people (and therefore, one reads in, not the state legislatures alone) which possess this power. Either formulation would help the Democratic-Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary, both of which were dominated by Federalists.|$|E
30|$|We {{consider}} {{two sets}} of ground truth/true values of the rainfall vector {u_t}_t= 1 ^ 8. In the first case, we assume <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> model is perfectly known. In the next case, we assume <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> model is not perfectly known.|$|R
50|$|In May 2009, the High Court found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> {{had failed}} to obtain proper {{clearance}} from its state-level environment impact assessment authority. The court restrained <b>the</b> <b>state</b> government from continuing further with Ganga Expressway project. It ordered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> obtain prior environmental clearance before continuing with the project.|$|R
30|$|These {{results are}} robust to {{controlling}} for two relevant variables. As expected, those individuals <b>that</b> regard <b>the</b> <b>state</b> as efficient think <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> {{should play a}} greater role in reducing economic and social risks. 8 The impact of interest in politics operates according to <b>the</b> theory. Those <b>that</b> have less interest in politics tend to endorse <b>the</b> view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> should play a secondary role in its social functions. However, respondents with less interest in politics also think <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> should provide jobs and this holds after controlling for their employment status and other socio-demographic characteristics. There are other consistent patterns <b>that</b> show in <b>the</b> results, all in the expected direction. Respondents who enjoy a higher socioeconomic status think <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> should play a less important role in the economy and in the provision of social welfare. The same occurs among more educated individuals.|$|R
5|$|Several Congressmen, {{including}} Hamilton, Robert Morris and Gouverneur Morris, {{attempted to}} use this Newburgh conspiracy as leverage to secure support from the states and in Congress for funding of the national government. They encouraged MacDougall to continue his aggressive approach, threatening unknown consequences if their demands were not met, and defeated proposals that would have resolved the crisis without establishing general federal taxation: <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> assume the debt to the army, or that an impost be established dedicated to {{the sole purpose of}} paying that debt.|$|E
5|$|When the {{legislative}} session ended on March 28, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky and addressed {{the state legislature}} on April 2, 1861. He urged the General Assembly to push for federal adoption of the Crittenden Compromise and advocated calling a border states convention, which would draft a compromise proposal and submit it to the Northern and Southern states for adoption. Asserting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> were coequal and free {{to choose their own}} course, he maintained that, if the border states convention failed, Kentucky should call a sovereignty convention and join the Confederacy as a last resort.|$|E
5|$|Both {{candidates}} believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut {{would determine}} the election. In New York, Blaine received less support than he anticipated when Arthur and Conkling, still {{powerful in the}} New York Republican party, failed to actively campaign for him. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine’s mother was Irish Catholic, and he believed his career-long opposition to the British government would resonate with the Irish. Blaine’s hope for Irish defections to the Republican standard were dashed late in the campaign when one of his supporters, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech denouncing the Democrats as the party of “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” The Democrats spread the word of this insult {{in the days before the}} election, and Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by just over one thousand votes. While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> United <b>States</b> District Court for the Central District of California agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> {{court rulings}} were correct, however the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. The Court of Appeals held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> court {{made a mistake}} in not {{accounting}} for Alvarado's youth and inexperience when evaluating custody.|$|R
50|$|California has {{the sixth}} largest {{economy in the}} world and a {{population}} larger than Poland. The Yes California campaign argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> suffers under federal overregulation, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> contributes more federal tax than it receives in federal funding, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> feels isolated from political power in Washington, D.C., {{and that there is a}} wide gap between the political and cultural differences of California and the rest of the country. For example, California disagrees with much of the rest of the country on immigration and environmental policies.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>state</b> {{asked for}} a stay pending appeal, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> would suffer {{irreparable}} injury if same-sex marriage were allowed, that plaintiff's claim raises unsettled questions of Constitutional law, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> has a reasonable probability of success in its appeal. On October 10, 2013, Judge Jacobson denied <b>the</b> <b>state</b> defendants' motion for a stay. She reasoned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> irreparable harm argument was [...] "largely abstract...which {{pales in comparison to}} the concrete harm caused to the plaintiffs," [...] who suffer from the denial of many federal benefits, and a massive litigation burden to challenge federal acceptance of New Jersey-specific civil unions in regards to these benefits.|$|R
25|$|Initially, at the Adelaide Constitutional Convention, Alfred Deakin {{proposed}} a resolution {{which would have}} allowed States to prohibit the importation of anything which they had first prohibited the sale of. After other delegates found problems with this amendment, Deakin amended it such <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>States</b> would {{only be able to}} restrict the importation of alcohol and opium, and such <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>States</b> would be able to regulate, not just prohibit, the sale of these items, provided that the regulation did not discriminate against imports. This proposal also failed in a 15-14 vote, largely due to Richard O'Connor's opposition.|$|E
25|$|Holmes {{expressed}} the Court's concern {{over how to}} compute interest on the debt, given {{the large amount of}} time (a half-century) which had passed. The majority concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> should negotiate over the matter, and another special master appointed if the issue proved contentious.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of the states signed the brief of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, authored by Abbott's solicitor general, Ted Cruz, advising that the case be affirmed, {{while at the same}} time emphasizing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> have a strong interest in maintaining each of the states' laws prohibiting and regulating firearms.|$|E
50|$|The name Moravian Serbia {{should not}} imply <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> was {{affiliated}} {{in any way}} with the region of Moravia in the present-day Czech Republic.

50|$|Note <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> not {{obliged to}} provide the lawyer of the accused's choice. See S v Vermaas; S v Du Plessis.

50|$|One {{policy in}} which the two {{candidates}} did disagree on was federal aid to education. While governor, Thurmond had been supportive of assistance from the federal government, but he reversed his position because he feared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> federal government would eventually force integration upon <b>the</b> <b>states.</b> Johnston countered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> universities received federal funds, but remained segregated and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> desperately needed assistance because its teachers were grossly underpaid.|$|R
25|$|In the Railway Servants' case, the High Court {{held that}} the {{doctrine}} worked both ways, that is, it held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> were also immune from Commonwealth laws, in finding that a trade union representing employees of the Government of New South Wales could not be registered under federal industrial relations legislation.|$|E
