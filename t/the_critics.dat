People often first express criticisms privately to test their validity, formulation, or reactions to them. It may require courage, conviction, or certainty to express a criticism publicly.|$|R

Then, the sentence could end, stating that <b>the</b> <b>critic</b> is <b>the</b> author of the book, or it could go on to clarify that <b>the</b> <b>critic</b> wrote something about a book. The ambiguity ends at was enlightening, which determines that the second alternative is correct.|$|R
