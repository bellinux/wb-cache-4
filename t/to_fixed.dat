5|$|Field {{punishment}} (FP) {{had replaced}} flogging (abolished {{at home in}} 1868 and on active service in 1881, although still used in military prisons until 1907). FP No.1 (in which the man was shackled <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> object, e.g. a large wheel) was awarded to 60,210 cases, equivalent to one man in 50 (although in practice there were many repeat offenders). FP No.1 could be very unpleasant depending on the weather, was abhorred by some as barbaric, and in some units was ritualised (e.g. by locking {{a man in a}} shed and throwing the handcuffs in with him); there were also cases of Australian troops releasing British troops whom they found tied up, although in other units it was regarded as a necessary sanction for serious offences. FP No.2 meant that a man was shackled but not fixed in place.|$|E

25|$|The inflections express gender, number, {{and case}} in adjectives, nouns, and pronouns, {{a process called}} declension. Markers are also {{attached}} <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> stems of verbs, to denote person, number, tense, voice, mood, and aspect, a process called conjugation. Some words are uninflected and undergo neither process, such as adverbs, prepositions, and interjections.|$|E
25|$|Sperner colorings {{have been}} used for {{effective}} computation of fixed points. A Sperner coloring can be constructed such that fully labeled simplices correspond <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> points of a given function. By making a triangulation smaller and smaller, one can show that the limit of the fully labeled simplices is exactly the fixed point. Hence, the technique provides a way to approximate fixed points.|$|E

25|$|The Jacob's Awards honoured {{teams of}} {{programme}} makers {{as well as}} individuals. For instance, in 1962, Telefís Éireann's Sports Department won an award for its general coverage during the station's first year of broadcasting.

25|$|Interest {{rates for}} the eurozone, set by the ECB since 1999. Levels are in {{percentages}} per annum. Between June 2000 and October 2008, the main refinancing operations were variable rate tenders, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> rate tenders. The figures indicated in the table from 2000 to 2008 refer to the minimum interest rate at which counterparties may place their bids.|$|E
25|$|Adjustable rates {{transfer}} part of {{the interest}} rate risk from the lender to the borrower. They can be used where unpredictable interest rates make fixed rate loans difficult to obtain. The borrower benefits if the interest rate falls but loses if the interest rate increases. The borrower benefits from reduced margins to the underlying cost of borrowing compared <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> or capped rate mortgages.|$|E

5000|$|Some Japanese {{words are}} written with {{different}} kanji {{depending on the}} specific usage of the word—for instance, the word naosu (<b>to</b> <b>fix,</b> or <b>to</b> cure) is written [...] when it refers to curing a person, and [...] when it refers <b>to</b> <b>fixing</b> an object.|$|R
25|$|The moving {{assembly}} line system, which started on October 7, 1913, allowed Ford {{to sell his}} cars at a price lower than his competitors. As he continued to fine-tune the system, Ford {{was able to keep}} reducing costs significantly. As volume increased, he was able to also lower the prices due <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> costs being spread over a larger number of vehicles. Other factors affected the price such as material costs and design changes.|$|E
25|$|Due to a {{phenomenon}} called precession of the equinoxes (where the Earth's axis slowly rotates like a spinning top in a 25,700-year cycle), {{there is a}} slow shift in the correspondence between Earth's seasons (and calendar) and the constellations of the zodiac. Thus, the tropical zodiac corresponds with {{the position of the}} earth in relation <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> positions in the sky (Western Astrology), while the sidereal zodiac is drawn based on the position in relation to the constellations (sidereal zodiac).|$|E
25|$|The 54th Fortress Infantry Regiment {{spent much}} of 1939 and 1940 {{completing}} and extending the fortifications in the sector. First contact with the Germans was made on 17 May when two mobile companies of the 54th undertook {{the defense of the}} Escaut bridges between Valenciennes and Bouchain, holding until the 26th when they fell back towards Dunkerque. The bridges at Hergnies, Renaissance and Quiévrain were destroyed. The battalions assigned <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> positions held until 25 June, when they too fell back to Dunkerque. The unit was evacuated during the Dunkirk evacuation to Plymouth, England.|$|E

50|$|Using fix {{templates}} is {{an alternative}} way to generate candidate patches. Fixtemplates are typically predefined program mutation rules for fixing specific classes ofbugs. Examples of fix templates include inserting a conditional statement tocheck whether {{the value of a}} variable is null <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> null pointer exception,inserting memory deallocation statement <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> memory leaks, and changing ainteger constant by one <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> off-by-one errors. Comparing to program mutation techniques, <b>fix</b> templates tend <b>to</b> achieve better candidate patches for bugswithin its scope. Fix templates are therefore often adopted by targetedtechniques.|$|R
25|$|The {{first term}} is the angular {{momentum}} {{of the center of}} mass relative to the origin. Similar to Single particle, below, it is the angular momentum of one particle of mass M at the center of mass moving with velocity V. The second term is the angular {{momentum of the}} particles moving relative to the center of mass, similar <b>to</b> <b>Fixed</b> center of mass, below. The result is general — the motion of the particles is not restricted to rotation or revolution about the origin or center of mass. The particles need not be individual masses, but can be elements of a continuous distribution, such as a solid body.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{upon the}} {{creation}} of Bretton Woods, with the U.S. producing half of the world's manufactured goods and holding half its reserves, the twin burdens of international management and the Cold War were possible to meet at first. Throughout the 1950s Washington sustained a balance of payments deficit to finance loans, aid, and troops for allied regimes. But during the 1960s the costs of doing so became less tolerable. By 1970 the U.S. held under 16% of international reserves. Adjustment to these changed realities was impeded by the U.S. commitment <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> exchange rates and by the U.S. obligation to convert dollars into gold on demand.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the move}} <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> {{exchange}} rates together with import licensing drastically curtailed exports, {{and the balance}} of payments problem became acute. The system became nearly unmanageable, and in 1953 a more flexible, multiple-exchange-rate system was introduced. Under the latter, imports considered essential were brought in at a favored rate; imports of goods that could be supplied domestically faced high rates and were allotted small portions of the available foreign exchange. Similarly, some exports were stimulated with a higher exchange rate than those of traditional exports. This system continued {{to be the main}} instrument for the promotion of import substitution industrialization, but the performance of the export sector improved only modestly.|$|E

Edílson Pereira de Carvalho said that he agreed to receive R$10,000 (US$4,400) <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> the result of the Brazilian National Championship match between Juventude and Figueirense, and that he was paid between R$10,000 and R$15,000 per fixed match.
