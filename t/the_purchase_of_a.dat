5|$|As Binky {{approached}} sexual maturity, zoo officials negotiated for <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> female {{polar bear}} named Mimi from the Tulsa Zoo in Oklahoma. As the transfer was being finalized, however, Mimi {{died from a}} viral disease in Tulsa. In February 1979, young polar bear twins (Nuka, a female, and Siku, a male) joined Binky in his enclosure. Binky got along poorly with Siku, however, so Siku was given to a zoo in Morelia, Mexico in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Eday Partnership, {{the local}} {{development}} trust {{is active in}} promoting the island's economy and has instigated numerous projects, including Eday Heritage Centre, and <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new diesel tank for the island. Eday's various community projects contributed £380,000 to the island's economy from 2005-7 and a 900kW community-owned wind turbine is planned.

5|$|Funds were {{provided}} for <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 6-inch (150mm) refracting telescope from T. Cooke & Sons. The dome was {{originally designed to}} mount a small transit, and the lengthy telescope, over 2 metres long, had a limited field of view though the dome's opening. A large stone pillar was constructed inside the tower, raising the telescope to bring it closer to the dome and improve its field of view. Unfortunately, the new telescope was unable {{to take part in}} the transit measurements due to bad weather, and missed the 1895 Transit of Mercury for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|Gillard {{worked in}} the {{industrial}} department of the law firm Slater & Gordon from 1988 through to 1995. In the early 1990s, {{she was in a}} relationship with Bruce Wilson, an official of the Australian Workers' Union (AWU). Gillard provided pro-bono legal assistance to help establish the AWU Workplace Reform Association for Wilson and his associate Ralph Blewitt. She was also involved in providing legal services in relation to <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Fitzroy property by Wilson and Blewitt.

By the 1500s that area was called the Menagerie.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, the Eugene Guard {{became a}} daily newspaper. Charles H. Fisher {{took over the}} paper in 1907 and {{published}} it until 1912 when E. J. Finneran purchased the paper. Finneran bankrupted the newspaper in 1916, partly due to <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> perfecting press that proved too expensive for such a small newspaper. The University of Oregon's journalism school briefly ran the paper during the receivership {{under the guidance of}} Eric W. Allen.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, the United Arab Emirates {{evaluated}} the Su-27M, but later acquired the Mirage 2000 {{due to the}} country's close relationship with France.

5|$|The port {{expanded}} {{greatly in}} the 19th century, with <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> steam tug in 1819, and {{the rebuilding of}} the breakwater in 1822. By this point, three ship building yards had also been established. The construction of the Blyth and Tyne Railway from 1849 allowed coal shipments to quickly expand, reaching 200,000 tons per annum. The Blyth Harbour and Dock Company was created in 1854, but with need for further expansion, it {{was replaced by a}} bill of parliament given Royal Assent on 19 June 1882, which constituted the current Blyth Harbour Commission. This allowed additional financing to be raised, for construction of the South Harbour.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the start}} of a massive {{armament}} programme that would consume more than a billion francs over the next ten years, but after Hitler's rise to power in Nazi Germany, the Social Democrats added their support to the efforts. They also supported Gottlieb Duttweiler's 1938popular initiative calling for <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thousand aircraft and the training of three thousand pilots. After 92,000citizens signed in support, nearly twice the number necessary for a national popular vote, the federal government offered a referendum proposal in 1939that was nearly as extensive, which was accepted by a 69percent majority.|$|E

5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} a {{contract}} by Norwich City manager John Bond, but the offer was bettered by Colin Addison at Derby County, and he verbally agreed a three-year contract with Derby. However, before signing the contract he received a late offer from Ken Knighton to play for Sunderland on a £300 a week contract with a £20,000 signing on fee – which more than quadrupled his wage at Bolton. Knighton appointed him as club captain. However Allardyce soon wearied of the long-distance travel from Sunderland {{to his home in}} Bolton, and put in a transfer request when chairman Tom Cowie refused to help finance <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> home in Sunderland. Cowie sacked Knighton late in the 1980–81 season, leaving caretaker manager Mick Docherty in charge to steer the club out of the First Division relegation zone. New manager Alan Durban left Allardyce out of the team {{at the start of the}} 1981–82 campaign, leaving Allardyce's departure from Roker Park inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Because of the disappointing {{box office}} {{performances}} of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules, Disney restricted its marketing campaign for Mulan spending $30 million on promotional advertisements compared {{to more than}} $60 million for Hercules the year before. Instead of the lavish media event premieres of Pocahontas in Central Park and the electric light parade on Fifth Avenue for Hercules, Disney opted to premiere the film at the Hollywood Bowl complete with Chinese lanterns and fortune cookies. Two days before the general release, McDonald's launched its promotional campaign by including one of eight toys free with <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Happy Meal. The promotion also included Szechuan sauce for its Chicken McNuggets, which would be referenced in a 2017 episode of the Adult Swim series Rick and Morty and subsequently brought back by McDonald's as a promotional item related to that show.|$|E
5|$|Campervans, caravans and trailer tents are {{not allowed}} into the main festival site. However, <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> campervan ticket in {{addition}} to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows. Some people choose to bring or hire a motorhome, though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot. The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as 'campervans', all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities, and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck in the mud and abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Crawford enjoyed foreign travel. In 1928 the OS {{sent him}} to the Middle East to collect aerial {{photographs}} that had been produced during the First World War and which were stored at Baghdad, Amman, and Heliopolis. In mid-1931 he visited Germany and Austria, furthering his interest in photography through <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Voigtländer. He later visited Italy with the intent of examining the possibility of producing OS maps pinpointing the country's archaeological sites; in November 1932 he met with the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, who was interested in Crawford's ideas about creating an OS map of archaeological sites in Rome. This was part of a wider project to produce a series of maps covering the entirety of the Roman Empire, for which Crawford visited various parts of Europe during the late 1920s and 1930s. Holiday destinations included Germany, Austria, Romania, Corsica, Malta, Algeria, and Tunisia, and in 1936 he purchased a plot of land in Cyprus on which he had a house built. During these vacations, he visited archaeological sites and met with local archaeologists, encouraging them to contribute articles to Antiquity.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) starts {{dating a}} Brussels sprout farmer, Esther Bruegger (Nora Kirkpatrick), while {{negotiating}} <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tractor {{with her father}} Henry (Allan Havey). Dwight does poorly in the negotiations, yielding to all of Henry's terms. During the haggling, Esther's sisters flirt with Clark Green (Clark Duke) and try to coax him into buying farming equipment. Clark stops Dwight from signing the papers and takes him aside {{to tell him that}} he thinks Esther and her sisters are too physically attractive to be interested in men like them, and that Esther is probably just dating him so that her father can take advantage of him on the tractor deal. Dwight sees the logic in Clark's suspicion. However, Esther appears and tells Dwight that he should not sign the contract and negotiate for a better deal. Dwight realizes that Esther does care for him after all, much to Angela's dismay.|$|E
5|$|Giles Guthrie, a {{respected}} aviator, merchant banker {{and director of}} British European Airways who would take over from Slattery as chairman and chief executive, also intended to perform some of the managing director's roles, making Smallpeice's position essentially redundant; Smallpeice was asked to resign by Amery, leaving the company late in 1963 to facilitate Guthrie's new management structure. Smallpeice, like Slattery, considered that had effectively been sacked. The concerns Slattery and Smallpeice expressed about the financial arrangements {{of the company and}} Vickers VC10 purchases would be vindicated when Guthrie was able to have the government write off the outstanding debt, inject additional cash into the company, and permit <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smaller number of Vickers VC10 aircraft. The Corbett report was never made public; neither Slattery, Smallpeice nor Guthrie are believed to have been given access to the full report.|$|E
