25|$|Picasso's Rose Period <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{theme of}} the {{fairground}} and circus performers; subjects often depicted in Post-Impressionist, romantic and symbolist art and verse (from Baudelaire and Rimbaud to Daumier and Seurat), where melancholy and social alienation pervade the saltimbanque. Corresponding to the tone of Picasso, acrobats represent both mystery and enchantment in the poems of Guillaume Apollinaire written in the same period.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevator}} doors {{open to reveal}} the private apartments of Harrison Hightower, the idol sitting {{on a table in}} the center. Hightower, under a ghostly form, glowing blue, appears beside it and reaches out to touch it. The idol zaps him with a bolt of green electricity, blasting him backwards past open {{elevator doors}} {{at the opposite end of}} the apartments, where Hightower falls down the shaft, which then fades away, replaced by a star field. The idol <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> guests' elevator and laughs before the doors close.|$|E

25|$|The highway's western {{terminus}} is {{the intersection}} with SH 207 at Silverton in Briscoe County. SH 256 {{is known as}} Lone Star Street in Silverton. The highway is co-routed with SH 86 for a short distance as it runs east. The route then runs past Caprock Canyons State Park and <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northeast, where it junctions with SH 70. After a brief co-routing with SH 70, the highway continues east through Lakeview to a junction with US 287 in Memphis. The highway is known as Noel Street in Memphis. The route then runs east to its final junction with US 83 in Childress County. Counties traversed by the highway include Briscoe, Hall and Childress. Most of the terrain covered by the highway is sparsely populated ranch country.|$|E
500|$|M-139 {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with US12 southwest of Niles in Bertrand Township. The highway travels northeasterly along Chicago Road through farm fields and residential neighborhoods. The trunkline turns north along Lincoln Avenue and then east on Main Street {{to run into}} downtown Niles. Main Street crosses the St. Joseph River, and at the intersection with Front Street, M-139 turns north along that street which is also called [...] "OLD US 31" [...] on some maps. The highway runs parallel to the river as both exit the downtown area. M-139 <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northwest {{on the outskirts of}} town, running through farm fields. The trunkline passes Webster and Long lakes as it crosses mixed forest and residential areas between Niles and Berrien Springs.|$|E
500|$|NY36 {{begins at}} the Pennsylvania state line in Troupsburg, where it {{continues}} south into Pennsylvania as PA249. Heading north from the state line in Steuben County, the route follows Troups Creek northward through rural Troupsburg {{on its way to}} the equally isolated town of Jasper, where it meets NY417 at a junction [...] west of the small hamlet of Jasper. NY36 joins NY417 here, following the east–west route to the western fringe of the community. At a T-intersection just outside the hamlet, the two routes split, with NY417 turning to the right (eastward) toward Corning and NY36 making a left-hand turn to continue northward toward the town of Canisteo. Across the town line, NY36 <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northwest and serves the hamlet of South Canisteo, which marks the southern end of both Colonel Hills Creek and a valley formed by the waterway.|$|E

500|$|The Southern {{terminus}} of the Yellow Line is {{adjacent to}} Kings Highway (Virginia Route 241) in Fairfax County, Virginia. The line heads northeast on a bridge over Hunting Creek and the Washington Beltway (Interstate 95) to a station {{just south of}} Eisenhower Avenue, which serves a number of government office buildings including the United States Patent Office. The Yellow Line then merges with the Blue Line and follows the right-of-way of the CSX Railroad through the City of Alexandria. The line enters a short tunnel under U.S. Route 1. After crossing a bridge over Four Mile Run, the line enters Arlington County on an elevated structure above the National Airport parking lots. At {{the north end of}} the airport, the Yellow Line enters a tunnel under 18th Street South and South Hayes Street. The tunnel continues along the southwest face of the Pentagon which is a two level station to facilitate a fork with the Blue Line. After the Pentagon station, the Yellow Line emerges from its tunnel east of the Pentagon and crosses the Charles R. Fenwick Bridge over the George Washington Memorial Parkway, the Potomac River, and Ohio Drive. At the end of the bridge, the Yellow Line re-enters a tunnel near the Jefferson Memorial and crosses under the Washington Channel. The tunnel merges with the Green Line tunnel under 7th Street Southwest just south of the L'Enfant Plaza. The joint Yellow Line— Green Line tunnel continues north through downtown Washington under 7th Street, turns west under Florida Avenue and U Street, and then north under 14th Street Northwest. The tunnel then <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northeast under Park Road and New Hampshire Avenue. [...] The tunnel then bends eastward under Rock Creek Cemetery and Fort Totten Park to emerge just before entering the lower level of the Fort Totten station. The track continues northeast as just the Green Line to the Greenbelt terminus.|$|E

2500|$|These two {{conflicting}} romances {{account for}} the ironic combination of chastity and availability encoded by the woman’s body. [...] The demure turn of her head shows that she has {{turned away from the}} Indian. [...] Yet this very gesture of refusal is also a sign of her availability: she <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> viewer. [...] It is by her role as sexual stereotype that the woman in Couse’s painting is really captive.” ...|$|E

[...] When Estragon rushes toward the back of the stage in Act II, Vladimir scolds him, saying that [...] "There's no way out there." [...] Also in Act II, Vladimir comments that their surroundings look nothing like the Macon country, and Estragon states that he's lived his whole life [...] "Here! In the Cackon country!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The highway {{continues}} east, traveling past occasional farmhouses as {{it gradually}} <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northeast. It passes another farm before entering a more developed corridor, although {{the transition is}} subtle. NY294 passes several residences on {{its way into the}} village of Boonville, located about [...] from the route's western terminus, where the highway becomes Ford Street. The highway serves Adirondack High School on its way to entering the heavily developed center of Boonville. Here, it becomes lined with dozens of closely situated houses and resumes an eastward direction for the remainder of its length. The route passes Boonville Elementary School {{on its way to the}} center of Boonville, where it ends at a junction with NY46 (Post Street).|$|E

60|$|Galloping rapidly {{along in}} {{the edge of the}} open ground comes a young officer on a snow-white horse. His saddle-blanket is scarlet. What a fool! No one who has ever been in battle but remembers how {{naturally}} every rifle <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> man on a white horse; no one but has observed how a bit of red enrages the bull of battle. That such colors are fashionable in military life must be accepted as the most astonishing of all the phenomena of human vanity. They would seem to have been devised to increase the death-rate.|$|E
60|$|From Marseilles to Genoa {{the course}} lies toward the {{northeast}} {{along the coast}} of France. Thence, in going toward Messina, it <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> southeast, and follows the coast of Italy. The route may be traced very easily on any map of modern Europe. The reason why Messina had been appointed as the great intermediate rendezvous of the fleet was two-fold. In the first place, it was a convenient port for this purpose, being a good harbor, and being favorably situated about midway of the voyage. Then, besides, Richard had a sister residing there. Her name was Joanna. She had married the king of the country. Her husband had died, it is true, and she was, at that time in some sense retired from public life. She was, indeed, in some distress, for the throne had been seized by a certain Tancred, who was her enemy, and, as she maintained, not the rightful successor of her husband. So Richard resolved, in stopping at Messina, to inquire into and redress his sister's wrongs; or, rather, he thought the occasion offered him a favorable opportunity to interfere in the affairs of Sicily, and to lord it over the government and people there in his usual arrogant and domineering manner.|$|E
