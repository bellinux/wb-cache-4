50|$|Most engine {{systems have}} {{idle speed control}} built into the ECU. The engine RPM is {{monitored}} by the crankshaft position sensor which plays a primary role in the engine timing functions for fuel injection, spark events, and valve timing. Idle speed is controlled by a programmable <b>throttle</b> <b>stop</b> or an idle air bypass control stepper motor. Early carburetor-based systems used a programmable <b>throttle</b> <b>stop</b> using a bidirectional DC motor. Early Throttle body injection (TBI) systems used an idle air control stepper motor. Effective idle speed control must anticipate the engine load at idle.|$|E
50|$|Most Super Comp or Quick Rod {{cars are}} capable of running well under the 8.90 index, but they use a number of {{electronic}} aids, including a timer and an adjustable throttle (also known as a <b>throttle</b> <b>stop),</b> to run {{as close to the}} index as possible without breaking out. In the IHRA, the class is called Quick Rod. It is the fastest of the three Rod Classes. Besides dragsters, there are also doorslammers, altereds and roadsters.|$|E
50|$|Only a few delay box {{manufacturers}} {{were willing}} to pay NHRA delay box approval fees and submit designs for the NHRA's approval without getting a non-disclosure agreement. Nor did many delay box manufacturers wish to be forced to comply with NHRA design change demands. These manufactures promptly went out of business or transitioned into non-racing related markets. As a result, very few companies manufacture delay boxes for drag racing today and each design is close in functionality to the next. The reduced competition allows these few companies to enjoy the entire market to themselves. Innovation has virtually ceased in the market. The approved manufacturers of delay boxes also enjoy a bonus of reduced competition in the market for their other on-board race timers such as: <b>throttle</b> <b>stop</b> timers, data loggers (data recorders), shifter timers, RPM switches, electronic nitrous oxide injection controllers and other devices. Delay box manufacturers that do not receive NHRA approval are shut out of the entire drag race electronics market.|$|E
50|$|Pro FWD is a {{class in}} drag racing. The E.T. Bracket {{categories}} are no-electronics classes. Delay devices, <b>throttle</b> <b>stops,</b> air shifters, transbrakes, etc. or any device that transmits real-time, on-track data to the driver or any remote location are prohibited. All applicable NHRA rules apply based on elapsed time.|$|R

50|$|Where {{an engine}} {{had to be}} stopped and started precisely, such as for a winding engine, it was useful to do this {{by means of the}} valve gear. This allows the engine to be stopped within a {{fraction}} of a revolution, where using a <b>throttle</b> or <b>stop</b> valve in the steam supply slowed the engine gradually and so would be far less precise.|$|R
50|$|The Honda MR50 Elsinore is an {{off-road}} mini cycle made by Honda. It was {{manufactured in}} Japan by Honda and imported first to Australia and the United States in 1974 {{and continued to}} {{be available in the}} USA, Canada and Australia until production was discontinued in 1975. It was patterned after the CR125 and CR250 Elsinores. Sometimes referred to as the Baby Elsinore, like its big brothers it had spoke wheels, knobby tires, and plastic fenders. The engine was a , air-cooled, two-stroke with 3 speed manual clutch transmission. Starting was primary kick with the starter {{on the right side of}} the bike. The bike used conventional controls just like larger models. The shift pattern was neutral at the bottom and 3 up. Lubrication was premix at 25:1. The exhaust had a spark arrestor. The ignition used points. Parents could limit the speed the rider could go by placing an allen screw in 1 of 4 <b>throttle</b> <b>stops</b> on the <b>throttle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The seventh labour was {{to capture}} the Cretan Bull. Hercules sailed to Crete, where King Minos gave Hercules {{permission}} to take the Bull away and even offered him assistance (which Hercules declined plausibly {{because he did not}} want the labor to be discounted as before). The Bull had been wreaking havoc on Crete by uprooting crops and leveling orchard walls. Hercules sneaked up behind the Bull and then used his hands to <b>throttle</b> it (<b>stopping</b> before it was killed), and then shipped it back to Tiryns. Eurystheus, who hid in his pithos at first sight of the creature, wanted to sacrifice the Bull to Hera, who hated Hercules. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Hercules. The Bull was released and wandered into Marathon, becoming known as the Marathonian Bull. Theseus would later sacrifice the bull to Athena and/or Apollo.|$|R
5000|$|The Phase 2 [...] "Hydractive 2" [...] cars {{no longer}} [...] "settled" [...] {{down to the}} bottom of their {{suspension}} travel after having been parked for a while; this feature was termed [...] "Anti-Sink" [...] by Citroën. Such systems have even more complex hydraulics than 'Sinkers' because of the use of isolating valves and an extra sphere near the rear 'axle'. The hydraulic systems were also a lot quieter when maneuvering; this was due to the changes the [...] "Anti-Sink" [...] system brought. Early cars, 'sinkers', had a single output hydraulic pump which had its output divided into separate circuits, one for the power steering and one for the suspension/brake circuits (power steering needs a large flow rate whereas the suspension/brakes doesn't). The device which does this job is called a FDV (Flow Diverter Value), and this device hisses noticeably when the car is standing still or maneuvering. A slight pull on the steering wheel or a blip of the <b>throttle</b> will <b>stop</b> the hiss for a few seconds or so. Later [...] "Anti-Sink" [...] cars have a dual output pump, referred to as a 6+2 pump due to the number of internal piston chambers. Such cars therefore have no need of the [...] "FDV" [...] and therefore do not hiss.|$|R
50|$|To {{avoid all}} of these problems, the Internet Protocol allows for routers to simply drop packets if the router or a network segment is too busy to deliver the data in a timely fashion, or if the IPv4 header {{checksum}} indicates the packet has been corrupted. Obviously this is not ideal for speedy and efficient transmission of data, and {{is not expected to}} happen in an uncongested network. Dropping of packets acts as an implicit signal that the network is congested, and may cause senders {{to reduce the amount of}} bandwidth consumed, or attempt to find another path. For example, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is designed so that excessive packet loss will cause the sender to <b>throttle</b> back and <b>stop</b> flooding the bottleneck point with data (using perceived packet loss as feedback to discover congestion).|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} NASA funded {{contract}} to develop and demonstrate a gas generator cycle hybrid rocket motor for upper stage space motor applications, the development and demonstration of a low sensitivity, high performance fuel composition was undertaken. The ultimate goal of the development program was to demonstrate successful hybrid operation (start, <b>stop,</b> <b>throttling)</b> of the fuel with high concentration (90 +%) hydrogen peroxide. The formulation development and lab-scale testing of a simple DOT Class 1. 4 c gas generator propellant is described. Both forward injected center perforated and aft injected end burner hybrid combustion behavior were evaluated with gaseous oxygen and catalytically decomposed 90 % hydrogen peroxide. Cross flow and static environments were found to yield profoundly different combustion behaviors, which were further governed by binder type, oxidizer level and, significantly, oxidizer particle size. Primary extinguishment was accomplished via manipulation of PDL behavior and oxidizer turndown, which is enhanced with the hydrogen peroxide system. Laboratory scale combustor results compared very well with 11 -inch and 24 -inch sub-scale test results with 90 % hydrogen peroxide...|$|R
50|$|Bandwidth {{throttling}} is {{a tactic}} that allows information and telecommunication companies to regulate network traffic and control network congestion. This {{type of measure}} {{is viewed as a}} limitation on users’ upload and download speeds (rates) of content. Comcast, one of the major ISPs, conducted bandwidth throttling on 49% of its customers who were using bandwidth for P2P file sharing. After Comcast’s actions were exposed, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ordered the company to <b>stop</b> <b>throttling</b> on a large scale. In particular, this form of net bias frequently targets heavy mobile users who consume large amounts of content (packets), like unlimited data plans. Mobile companies such as AT&T and Verizon have their own throttling policy because they are sometimes required to limit users’ traffic to maintain the quality of the entire network. Recently, however, throttling has become a controversial issue because some companies infringe upon this policy. For example, AT&T had to pay US$850 to one customer to compensate for slowing down data speeds because they violated the terms of unlimited smartphone data contracts. In response to these complaints from smartphone subscribers, AT&T announced that they would change their policy for unlimited data users.|$|R
5000|$|Cabianca's death {{resulted}} from a bizarre incident at the Modena Autodrome test track in Italy. The Modena Autodrome was situated near Via Emilia, which crosses the city of Modena. Cabianca was testing a Cooper-Ferrari F1 car, owned by Scuderia Castellotti, when he suffered a suspected stuck <b>throttle.</b> Unable to <b>stop,</b> his Cooper went off track, struck a spectator and then went through {{the gate of the}} Autodrome which was open because of men at work near the track. The car crossed the Via Emilia and crashed against the wall of a workshop. Crossing the road, Cabianca's Cooper struck a bicycle, a motorcycle, and a small mini-van (not a taxi as often reported) and three parked cars. The driver of the mini-van (also called [...] "giardinetta" [...] following a famous van of Fiat) and the motorcycle driver were killed at the scene. The biker was crushed and killed instantly by a heavy block of iron carried on the mini-van. Cabianca was conscious, but died a few hours later at the hospital. The spectator hit just after the car left the track suffered severe leg injuries, but survived.|$|R
40|$|Hybrid rocket motors offer {{many of the}} {{benefits}} of both liquid and solid rocket systems. Like liquid engines, hybrid rocket motors are able to be <b>throttled,</b> can be <b>stopped</b> and restarted, and are safer than solid rocket motors since the fuel and oxidizer are in different physical states. Hybrid rocket motors are similar to solid motors in that they are relatively simple and have a high density-specific impulse. One of the major drawbacks of hybrid rocket motors is a slower burning rate than solid rocket motors. Complex port geometries provide greater burning surface area to compensate for lower burning rates but are difficult and expensive to manufacture. Additive manufacturing can reduce manufacturing costs of these complex port geometry fuel grains. It has also been shown that the addition of energetic materials, such as aluminum, can increase the burning rate and density-specific impulse of the rocket motor. Previously, additive manufacturing was restricted to plastics or fast-setting paraffin wax, both with low solids concentrations. This paper investigates the process of printing hybrid rocket fuel grains and the differences in physical characteristics between printed and conventionally cast samples. Using a proprietary printing system, we have successfully printed 85 % solids loading aluminum and HTPB fuel samples. Material creep was significant and resulted in samples bulging and sagging as well as gaps between print lines being filled in more completely. The finish and cross sections of printed samples were of comparable quality to cast samples. This indicates that the manufacturing process has not significantly affected the physical characteristics of the fuel samples...|$|R
