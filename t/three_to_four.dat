Yoga can be learned, {{with the help of}} a teacher, within <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> months if practiced six times a day. If frequent practice is not possible, yoga can be mastered over a period of <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> years.|$|E

This enzyme is found in all forms of life and functions {{in the same way}} in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

Estimates of the number of protons required to synthesize one ATP have ranged from <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four,</b> with some suggesting cells can vary this ratio, to suit different conditions.|$|E

The postseason was also expanded to include the top four teams, rather than only the top three.|$|E

Also, they draw {{moisture}} from vegetables {{with which they are}} stored which may cause them to decay.|$|E
