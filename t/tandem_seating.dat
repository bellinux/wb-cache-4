5|$|Although the {{full-size}} mock-up inspection in April 1949 {{was generally}} favorable, range again became a concern since the J40s and early model J57s had excessive fuel consumption. Despite talk of another revision of specifications {{or even a}} full design competition among aircraft manufacturers, General LeMay, {{now in charge of}} Strategic Air Command, insisted that performance should not be compromised due to delays in engine development. In a final attempt to increase range, Boeing created the larger 464-67, stating that once in production, the range could be further increased in subsequent modifications. Following several direct interventions by LeMay, Boeing was awarded a production contract for thirteen B-52As and seventeen detachable reconnaissance pods on 14 February 1951. The last major design change—also at General LeMay's insistence—was a switch from the B-47 style <b>tandem</b> <b>seating</b> to a more conventional side-by-side cockpit, which increased the effectiveness of the copilot and reduced crew fatigue. Both XB-52 prototypes featured the original <b>tandem</b> <b>seating</b> arrangement with a framed bubble-type canopy.|$|E
5|$|The Cheyenne had a two-seat tandem cockpit {{featuring}} {{an advanced}} navigation and fire control suite. The <b>tandem</b> <b>seating</b> placed the {{pilot in the}} rear seat, and the gunner in the front seat. An unusual feature of the gunner's station was that the entire seat, sighting system, and firing controls rotated to keep the gunner facing {{the same direction as}} the gun turret being controlled. The gun-sight afforded the gunner direct viewing from the turret by way of a periscope sight. The pilot had a helmet mounted sight system for aiming weapons.|$|E
25|$|The narrow body, and {{corresponding}} low frontal area, was achieved with <b>tandem</b> <b>seating,</b> which also allowed {{the body to}} taper like an aircraft fuselage, within a practical length. The <b>tandem</b> <b>seating</b> also centralized {{the mass of the}} car along the longitudinal axis which, combined with the low center of gravity, low weight, and wheel placement at the vehicle's extremes, gave the Tg500 good handling characteristics. A more minor advantage of <b>tandem</b> <b>seating</b> was that it made an export version to countries that drive on the left unnecessary.|$|E

25|$|Early in 1948, Temco’s president, Robert McCulloch, {{received}} an inquiry from the Philippine Government expressing {{an interest in}} a tandem trainer version of the Swift. The first TE-1A was a modification of the Swift GC-1B, hand-built to rough layout drawings, the major difference in appearance being the <b>tandem</b> <b>seating</b> arrangement {{which resulted in a}} narrow windshield and an elongated two-piece canopy with a fixed bubble at the rear. This TE-1A prototype was completed late in 1948. After initial flight tests a 145-hp Continental engine replaced the original 125-hp installation.|$|E
25|$|In {{place of}} the curtailed B-57A, a more refined bomber variant, the B-57B, was developed. Having a more lengthy {{development}} time, this model incorporated the structural and system changes that had been recommended by WADC, {{which resulted in the}} aircraft being more adaptable than its B-57A predecessor. Of the external changes, the most significant was the adoption of a fighter-style canopy accompanied by a flat-panel windshield and a <b>tandem</b> <b>seating</b> arrangement, providing for greater transparency and an improved view for both the pilot and navigator, as well as allowing for a gunsight to be equipped, the corresponding glazed bombing nose of the B-57A was deleted along with the starboard crew entrance to the cockpit.|$|E

25|$|This {{project was}} funded by the company as a private venture, in {{anticipation}} of possible RAF interest. The design was conceived of as having <b>tandem</b> <b>seating</b> and a combat capability in addition to training, as it was felt the latter would improve export sales potential. By {{the end of the year}} HSA had submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Defence based on the design concept, and in early 1970 the RAF issued Air Staff Target (AST) 397 which formalised the requirement for new trainers of this type. The RAF selected the HS.1182 for their requirement on 1 October 1971 and the principal contract, for 175 aircraft, was signed in March 1972.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{aircraft}}'s many faults, {{only two}} {{were lost in}} accidents. The seventh aircraft (38-492) was on its final test flight from the Buffalo factory prior to delivery to the Air Corps when pilot John Strickler, a Bell pilot and engineer/co-pilot Brian Sparks, who was Bell's chief test pilot at the time, encountered problems recovering from a deliberate spin attempt {{which was part of}} the test flight profile. Despite every effort to emerge from the spin, the aircraft would not respond, and it appeared that the rudder had locked. Co-pilot Sparks shut down the engines and waited for the propellers to come to a stop before bailing out. Because of the <b>tandem</b> <b>seating,</b> it was necessary for Sparks to exit the aircraft first, and in doing so he struck the empennage, breaking his legs — and in the process, freeing the rudder. Strickler decided to stay with the aircraft and attempt an emergency landing. By this time, the aircraft had lost sufficient altitude that there was not time to restart the engines. Strickler put the Airacuda down hard in a farmer's field, and walked away unhurt. The Airacuda was so badly damaged it had to be scrapped.|$|E
500|$|Only {{three of}} the first {{production}} version, the B-52A, were built, all loaned to Boeing for flight testing. The first production B-52A differed from prototypes in having a redesigned forward fuselage. The bubble canopy and <b>tandem</b> <b>seating</b> {{was replaced by a}} side-by-side arrangement and a [...] nose extension accommodated more avionics and a new sixth crew member. In the rear fuselage, a tail turret with four 0.50inch (12.7mm) machine guns with a fire-control system, and a water injection system to augment engine power with a 360USgallon (1,363L) water tank were added. The aircraft also carried a 1,000USgallon (3,785L) external fuel tank under each wing. The tanks damped wing flutter and also kept wingtips close to the ground for ease of maintenance.|$|E
