40|$|The {{following}} project {{aimed at}} promoting integrated and long-lasting learning is described for an <b>Immunology</b> <b>course,</b> {{but it may}} be adapted to other disciplines. Students were asked to develop and carry out a research project {{to examine the relationship between}} immune function and stress. The experiments were required to include the assessment of salivary cortisol and salivary IgA (sIgA) with enzyme immunoassays. All other aspects of the experiments were developed by student groups with appropriate guidance from the instructor. Data are presented for one group project that assessed the effect of music on cortisol and sIgA. Overall levels of sIgA and cortisol were consistent with reported values. Students found a significant decrease in cortisol over time. Additionally, there was a trend that supported the overall student hypothesis regarding the effect of stress and immune function. Compared with the same <b>Immunology</b> <b>course</b> that included an instructor-designed experiment using enzyme immunoassays for cortisol and sIgA, several assessments (e. g., final grades and comments on student evaluations) show that overall learning seemed to be much better in the course with the student-directed research project...|$|R

40|$|The {{immune system}} is our major defense against viruses, tumors and other ‘foreign invaders’. The issue of humans’ defense against viral infections and the {{reaction}} of immune system to these infections are the main problems in <b>practical</b> <b>immunology.</b> To understand <b>the</b> integrated behaviour of the immune system, {{there is no alternative}} to Mathematical modeling. This current study seeks to extend the one system of two differential equations originally developed by a system of three differential equations. The system was used to model the behaviour of lymphoid cells in the absence of viruses. The steady states and the stability for this differential model were deduced. The model permitted the existence of two types of stationary states. These are a stable state and an unstable state. It was found from the study that a stable state represents the pre-programmed state of the matured lymphoid cells to attack pathogens which may invade the organism. The unstable state represents immuno-deficiency as a result of one or more cells within the immune system not operating properly or the cells are absent altogether...|$|R

As a final part of R 3, students worked collaboratively to construct a Group Research Paper that reported on a hypothesis-driven research project, followed by a peer review activity that mimicked the last stage of the scientific publishing process.

This course currently uses traditional instructional strategies: didactic lectures and guided “cookbook” labs.

We have developed learning outcomes based on key competencies and content knowledge in our discipline, and are using these to guide the development of instructional strategies and assessments. The new lab course will feature a problem-based learning approach that will allow students to formulate their own hypothesis and design and carry out an experiment using the reagents at their disposal. The problems that will form the basis of student-designed experiments are being developed through an iterative process.

40|$|The {{study of}} immunology, {{particularly}} {{in this day}} and age, is an integral aspect of the training of future biologists, especially health professionals. Unfortunately, many students lose interest in or lack true comprehension of immunology due to the jargon of the field, preventing them from gaining a true conceptual understanding that is essential to all biological learning. To that end, a new video game, ImmuneQuest, has been developed that allows undergraduate students to “be” cells in the immune system, finding and attacking pathogens, while answering questions to earn additional abilities. The ultimate goal of ImmuneQuest is to allow students to understand how the major cells in the immune system work together to fight disease, rather than focusing on them as separate entities as is more commonly done in lecture material. This work provides the first assessment of ImmuneQuest in an upper-level <b>immunology</b> <b>course.</b> Students had significant gains in learning of information presented in ImmuneQuest compared with information discussed in lecture only. Furthermore, while students found the game “frustrating” at times, they agreed that the game aided their learning and recommended it for future courses. Taken together, these results suggest that ImmuneQuest appears to be a useful tool to supplement lecture material and increase student learning and comprehension...|$|R
