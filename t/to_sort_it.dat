25|$|The {{stand by}} diver will be {{prepared}} {{in the same}} way as the working diver, but will not enter the water until needed. He will usually be prepared to the stage of readiness to enter the water, and then will remove his mask, or have his helmet removed and will then sit in as comfortable a place as can be found, so that in case of an emergency he can be readied for action in as short a time as possible. This often means setting up some form of shelter from the weather, and heat and sunshine are usually more of a problem than cold and wet. It is frequently necessary to cool the standby diver to avoid overheating, and dehydration can also be a problem. When the working diver is using a helmet, the standby diver may use a full face mask or bandmask, as this makes it quicker to get into the water in an emergency. The stand by diver's job is to wait until something goes wrong, and then be sent in <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>it</b> out. For this reason a stand by diver should be one of the best divers on the team regarding diving skills and strength, but does not have to be expert at the work skills for the specific job. When deployed, the standby diver will normally follow the umbilical of the diver who is in trouble, as unless it has been severed, it will reliably lead to the correct diver. The standby diver must maintain communications with the supervisor throughout the dive and is expected to give a running commentary of progress so that the supervisor and surface crew know as much as possible what is happening and can plan accordingly, and must take the necessary steps to resolve incidents, which may involve supply of emergency air or locating and rescuing an injured or unconscious diver. In bell diving, the bellman is the standby diver, and may have to recover a distressed diver to the bell and give first aid if necessary and possible.|$|E

This paper characterizes a set of payo functions consistent with two salient marriage age patterns: (1) assortative match- ing by age, and (2) age matching", a formalization of the age dierence at marriage between men and women. The payo function has to satisfy certain conditions on its slope and curvature in age. However, <b>to</b> achieve <b>sorting</b> <b>it</b> need not be supermodular (submodular) in partners' ages, unlike in search models where the match payo depends on the xed " of each individual. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Sorting Networks (SN) are {{efficient}} tools <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> {{an input}} data sequence. They are composed {{by a set}} of comparison-exchange operations called compara-tors. The comparators are a priori fixed for a determined input size. The comparators are independent of the input configuration. SN with a minimal number of comparators results in an optimal manner <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> data; <b>it</b> is a classical NP-hard problem studied for more than 50 years. In this paper we adapted a biological inspired heuristic called Artificial Immune System to evolve candidate sets of SN. Besides, a local strategy is proposed to consider the information regarding comparators and sequences to be ordered at a determined building stage. New optimal Sorting Networks designs for input sizes from 9 to 15 are presented. ...|$|R

40|$|Integer sorting is a {{subclass}} of the sorting problem {{where the}} elements have integer {{values and the}} largest element is polynomially bounded {{in the number of}} elements <b>to</b> be <b>sorted.</b> <b>It</b> is useful for applications in which the size of the maximum value of element <b>to</b> be <b>sorted</b> is bounded. In this paper, we present a new distributed radix-sort algorithm for integer sorting. The structure of our algorithm is similar <b>to</b> radix <b>sort</b> except that <b>it</b> typically requires less number of communication phases. We present experimental results for our algorithm on two distributed memory multiprocessors, the Intel Paragon and the Thinking machine CM- 5. These results are compared with two other well known practical parallel sorting algorithms based on radix sort and sample sort. The experimental results show that the distributed radix-sort is competitive with the other two algorithms. 1 Introduction Sorting has been a widely studied problem for parallel machines [8, 9, 12, 14, 13, 10, 1, 4, 7, 6, 11].
