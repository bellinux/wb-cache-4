5|$|After the {{unexpected}} loss of Armendáriz, production proceeded, experiencing complications from uncredited rewrites by Berkely Mather during filming. Editor Peter Hunt set about editing the film while key elements were {{still to be}} filmed, helping to restructure the opening scenes. Hunt and Young conceived of moving the Red Grant <b>training</b> <b>sequence</b> {{to the beginning of}} the film (prior to the main title), a signature feature that has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since. The briefing with Blofeld was rewritten, and back projection was used to re-film Lotte Lenya's lines.|$|E
5|$|With filming complete, MJZ {{contacted}} post-production company Asylum {{to begin}} work on the substantial visual effects component of The Life. The team, led by Visual Effects Supervisor Robert Moggach, tripled in size as {{the scale of the}} work required became apparent, given the deadline of three weeks. Work on the opening funeral scene was relatively easy, requiring the creation of only minor elements such as additional tombstones in the foreground and color correction on the actors. The same was true for the <b>training</b> <b>sequence,</b> where only minimal tracking work and compositing of matte backgrounds was required. The bulk of the visual effects work was in the battle sequence. This ranged from simple work such as wire removal to the creation of dynamic lighting and reflections from visors and armor, to particle effects for the background smoke and dust, plasma weapon fire and alterations to some of the filmed explosions to lend them the appearance given to plasma explosions within the Halo games. The entire background was a 3D projection of matte paintings and dramatic skies. While the Brute was partially animatronic, substantial adjustments such as scaling to almost twice the size and the enhancement of fine muscle movements of the creature were made. Other elements, such as the Banshee aircraft and the drop-pods, were created entirely through the use of CGI. Software used by Asylum FX included Flame and Nuke for compositing, Maya for animation, RenderMan and Mantra for rendering, SynthEyes for tracking, Silhouette Pro for rotoscoping work.|$|E

30|$|Taking the MSE and PAPR {{into account}} simultaneously, we have {{suggested}} new designs of optimal <b>training</b> <b>sequences</b> exhibiting lower or similar complexity {{when compared with}} the conventional optimal <b>training</b> <b>sequences.</b> Simulation results also show that the proposed <b>training</b> <b>sequences</b> would perform adequately even when signal clipping occurs during signal processing.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a channel estimation and tracking scheme for OFDM MIMO systems based on pilot tones. The {{mean square error}} of the proposed scheme is derived, and through this we derive optimal <b>training</b> <b>sequences</b> and placement of the pilot tones. It is shown in this paper that minimum mean square (MMSE) channel estimation is obtained with equipowered, equispaced, orthogonal and phase shift orthogonal <b>training</b> <b>sequences.</b> Through simulations it is shown that the optimal pilot-tone based <b>training</b> <b>sequences</b> as derived in this paper significantly outperform full-block <b>training</b> <b>sequences</b> in rapidly time varying channels. Additionally, we show that by satisfying all conditions of optimality, our <b>training</b> <b>sequences</b> outperform orthogonal and random sequences, which both appear to be sub-optimal for channel identification...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of <b>training</b> <b>sequences</b> design for symbol timing {{estimation}} in MIMO channel is addressed. In particular, we consider correlated fading between antennas. The optimal <b>training</b> <b>sequences</b> are derived by minimizing the modified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) {{with respect to the}} training data. It is found that when the transmit pulse is a root raised cosine pulse and there is no correlation among antennas, the optimal <b>training</b> <b>sequences</b> resemble the Walsh sequences. Furthermore, it is also found that the the impact of not knowing the antenna correlations when designing <b>training</b> <b>sequences</b> is very small. © 2004 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
500|$|A live-action trailer titled The Life {{was posted}} on the Internet in September and later used in {{television}} spots {{as part of the}} promotional material released for the game. Filmed at several locations in Budapest, Hungary, The Life follows an ODST named Tarkov from a military funeral where he is inspired to become a soldier, through training and combat and up to the moment he becomes a leader in battle. [...] The short film was created by advertising agency TAG SF with effects by Asylum, and directed by production company MJZ, who also handled the award-winning Halo 3 [...] "Believe" [...] advertisement. Legacy Effects designed and fabricated props, weapons, armor, and a Covenant Brute costume within two weeks. Bungie supplied 3D geometry that allowed the company to quickly create accurate representations of in-game items, and provided input on the UNSC dress uniforms. The initial cemetery scene was filmed inside the cooling tower of an active nuclear power plant in Budapest, and outside the tower the production team created a mud pit and obstacle course to simulate basic training. Members of the Hungarian special forces served as drill instructors in the <b>training</b> <b>sequence,</b> firing blanks. Finally, filming moved to an abandoned Soviet-era aluminum refinery for the short's final memorial scene. An additional scene was shot there, but did not appear in the final product.|$|E
500|$|Also at San Diego Comic Con, Derrickson {{noted that}} there were still [...] "a couple pickup shoots" [...] {{to do for the}} film to [...] "clarify the logic". Further content for the film's <b>training</b> <b>sequence</b> was also shot during these reshoots, as early test audiences [...] "loved [...] and wanted more". Wong {{indicated}} that the reshoots had been completed in August. Dan Harmon wrote material for these additional scenes, which Derrickson described as [...] "script analysis and dialogue work", not enough to receive credit in the film. Feige said that in addition to any humor that Harmon could add to the film, he was brought on to [...] "give us his opinions on the sci-fi concepts." [...] Before the film's sets were demolished, [...] director Taika Waititi took advantage by writing and filming a scene featuring Strange meeting Chris Hemsworth's Thor. The scene was for Ragnarok and shot before that film began production. Derrickson and Marvel felt the scene was [...] "kind of perfect" [...] to show Strange joining the wider MCU after his stand alone introduction, and so added it to Doctor Strange as a mid-credits scene. A post-credits scene, directed by Derrickson, teases Mordo's role as an antagonist to Strange in a potential Doctor Strange sequel. Stan Lee's cameo in the film was directed by Gunn on the set of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. This was alongside several other Lee cameos, to limit the amount of travel he had to do for the next four MCU films. Gunn contacted Derrickson during the shoot to ensure that the shot matched up with the respective Doctor Strange scene, and [...] "kept throwing lines at" [...] Lee on the day to give Derrickson and Marvel plenty of options to choose from for the film. Additional options Gunn filmed included: Lee reading a book and asking a gentleman next to him if he knew what the word excelsior meant; Lee laughing really hard and stating he was laughing for no reason, being [...] "totally crazy"; and Lee laughing hysterically at a Garfield book, noting how the character [...] "HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!". Gunn felt the Garfield option was originally meant to appear in {{the final version of the}} film, but ended up being too long for the scene. By October 10, 2016, Derrickson had completed the film.|$|E

40|$|Different {{mechanisms}} {{are involved in}} the formation of memories necessary for daily living. For example, different memory representations are formed for the practiced transitions between key-presses (i. e. pressing key 2 after 3 in 4 - 3 - 2 - 1) and for the ordinal position of each key-press (i. e. pressing key 2 in the third ordinal position in 4 - 3 - 2 - 1) in a motor sequence. Whether the resulting transition-based and ordinal-based memories (Song & Cohen, in press) can be consciously recalled is unknown. Here, we studied subjects who over a week of training and testing formed transition and ordinal-based memory representations of skill for a 12 -item sequence of key-presses. Afterwards, subjects were first asked to recall and type the <b>trained</b> <b>sequence</b> and then to perform random key-presses avoiding the <b>trained</b> <b>sequence.</b> The difference in the ability to purposefully recall and avoid a <b>trained</b> <b>sequence</b> represents conscious recall (Destrebecqz & Cleeremans, 2001). We report that (a) the difference in the ability to purposefully recall and to avoid the <b>trained</b> <b>sequence</b> correlated with ordinal-based but not with transition-based memory, (b) subjects with no ability to recall or avoid the <b>trained</b> <b>sequence</b> formed transition-based but not ordinal-based memories, and (c) subjects with full ability to recall and avoid the <b>trained</b> <b>sequence</b> formed both transition-based and ordinal-based memories. We conclude that ordinal-based memory can be voluntarily recalled when transition-based memory cannot, documenting a differential capacity to recall memories forming a motor skill. Understanding that different memories form a motor skill, with different neural substrates (Cohen & Squire, 1980), may help develop novel training strategies in neurorehabilitation of patients with brain lesions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{an adaptive}} beamforming algorithm {{for a massive}} MIMO system with multiple cells. The pilot contamination problem arises in multi-cell systems owing to transmission of the same pilots from users (or mobile stations) in different cells. The focus {{of this paper is}} to study the impact of different <b>training</b> <b>sequences</b> on pilot contamination in Massive MIMO systems. Specifically, we consider an adaptive beam-forming salgorithm which has been previously applied in MIMO interference networks. This algorithm uses bidirectional training in which <b>training</b> <b>sequences</b> are sent from current beamformers to adapt the mobile station receive filters and then the <b>training</b> <b>sequences</b> using mobile station filters as beamformers, are sent in reverse direction to adapt the beamformers at base station side. The adaptation of both transmit and receive filters is done using the least squares objective function. The adaptive beamforming algorithm shows improvement in performance in terms of average sum rate if the random <b>training</b> <b>sequences</b> are transmitted from users in different cells.
