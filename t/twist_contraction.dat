40|$|Elastic {{warp-knitted}} composite fabrics with far-infrared emissivity and an anion-releasing property {{were prepared}} using bamboo charcoal (BC), copper (Cu), and phase-change material (PCM). The functional composite fabric, which {{was composed of}} self-made complex yarns with various twisting degrees and material composition, were created using a rotor twister and ring-spinning technique. The fabric structure was diversified by the feeding modes of weft yarn into a crochet-knitting machine. The twist number of complex yarns was optimized by tensile tenacity, <b>twist</b> <b>contraction,</b> and hairiness, and analysis showed that twisting at 12 twists per inch produced the highest tensile tenacity and appropriate <b>twist</b> <b>contraction</b> and hairiness. Comfort evaluation showed that the elastic composite fabrics with BC weft yarns exhibited higher water–vapor transmission rate and air permeability, reaching 876 g/m 2 ∙ day and 73. 2 cm 3 /s/cm 2, respectively. Three structures of composite fabric with various weft yarns had > 0. 85 ε far-infrared emissivity and 350 – 420 counts/cm 3 anion amount. The prepared elastic warp-knitted fabrics can provide a comfortable, dry, and breathable environment to the wearer and can thus be applied as health-care textiles in the future...|$|E
40|$|Understanding of the {{dynamics}} of the heart is required for the prevention and treatment of cardiac related diseases {{as well as for the}} design of pace-makers and artificial hearts. We present a new method for the analysis of myocardium motion and deformation based on the study of velocity encoded NMR images. By applying a few mathematical operators on the semi [...] automatically segmented image of the left ventricle muscle, we compute quantities that describe {{the dynamics}} of the heart and provide with a simplified evaluation of its overall performance. The method needs little human interaction and could be used by physicians as a valuable indicator of the contractility of the heart. Since displacement, <b>twist,</b> <b>contraction,</b> strain and torsion are computed from analytic expressions, the method can also be used to evaluate the performance of models for the heart. Introduction Extensive knowledge {{of the dynamics}} of the heart is desirable for the understanding of cardiac malfunction and related [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Dystonia is a {{movement}} disorder characterized by repetitive <b>twisting</b> muscle <b>contractions</b> and postures 1, 2. Its molecular pathophysiology is poorly understood, {{in part due to}} limited knowledge of the genetic basis of the disorder. Only three genes for primary torsion dystonia (PTD), TOR 1 A (DYT 1) 3, THAP 1 (DYT 6) 4, and CIZ 15 have been identified. Using exome sequencing in two PTD families we identified a novel causative gene, GNAL, with a nonsense p. S 293 X mutatio...|$|R
40|$|Being {{a highly}} {{physical}} demanding sports, athletics depends on efficient training to overcome all physical demands without lesions. The {{aim of the}} present study was to analyze the types of lesions and their causes. The sample was constituted by forty-three athletes, sixteen males and twenty-seven females, 23. 2 years of average age. A questionnaire containing five open questions and five closed questions was used as an instrument to determine the major lesions caused by athletics practice. The results showed that 84 % of the athletes had already had some kind of lesions: 77 % of which occurred during training and 23 % during contest. The most frequent lesions were distension, tendinitis, <b>twisting,</b> <b>contraction</b> and inflammation. Legs were the most affected parts: 85 % for jumpers, 85 % for runners and 60 % for throwers. When the lesions occurred, 76 % of the jumpers, 84 % of the runners and 85 % of the throwers had no other health problem, but 52. 7 % of the athletes were in a state of anxiety before the contest and 13. 8 % had difficulties in concentrating on the contest. As for treatment 55. 5 % went to see a physiotherapist, and 16. 6 % went to see the medical doctor and the physiotherapist. The consequences of the lesions for the athletes’ performance were the following: 75 % missed important contest events and 70 % missed training for several months while they recuperated from their lesions. The results led to the conclusion that the best means to prevent lesions is to use adequate sites and equipments, efficient and individualized training coached by qualified specialists...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFactors such as aging, atherosclerosis, hypertension, genetic {{defects and}} {{diabetes}} mellitus {{have been known}} to cause arteries to develop various shapes and characteristics in patients such as tortuosity, kinking, <b>twisting,</b> elongation, <b>contraction,</b> and curving. The change in artery mechanics can cause a variety of cardiovascular diseases among men and women. The improvement in technology and techniques has allowed access to different therapies such as balloon angioplasty or stenting. Stents are permanent implants that undergo repetitive deformations as a result of patient daily activities such as walking, flexing, sitting, climbing stairs, and getting into a car. Often, these deformations imposed on the stents result in stent failures. It is imperative that the biomechanics environment of the arteries causing stent failure is well understood and the stents be evaluated under multiple loading modes for increased life-cycle. As a result, this paper aims to summarize part of the available literature that reports studies on biomechanical environment in healthy and diseased arteries using various analytical methods...|$|R
40|$|Dystonia is a {{movement}} disorder, which causes sustained muscle <b>contractions,</b> <b>twisting</b> movements, and abnormal postures. Writer’s cramp is the most commonly identified tasks-specific focal dystonia of writing, characterised by abnormal muscle spasm of hand and arm. Even in the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD- 10), writer’s cramp is classified under idiopathic nonfamilial dystonias. Our case was a 20 years, Hindu, unmarried, literate of middle socioeconomic status, from urban part of Tripura. He presented with history of difficulty to write because of a stiffening {{of his right hand}} and also he noticed that prolonged period of writing caused cramping pain. He was a diagnosed case of paranoid schizophrenia (F 20. 0) as per ICD- 10 for last three years and was on tablet aripiprazole. Diagnosis of writer’s cramp was made which developed after six months of treatment with aripiprazole 15 mg...|$|R
