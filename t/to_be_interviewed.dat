He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being willing to pay a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement {{that he would not be}} sacked, assurances that he would have no interference from the board in team affairs, and three days off a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to publicise the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Avery {{leaves the}} Chronicle, {{and moves to}} the Sacramento Bee. Graysmith {{persistently}} contacts Toschi about the Zodiac murders, and eventually impresses the veteran detective with his knowledge of the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the evidence, he provides contact names of other police departments in other counties where Zodiac murders occurred. Armstrong transfers from the San Francisco Police homicide division, and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter. Graysmith continues his own investigation, which is profiled in the Chronicle, and he allows himself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> on television about his book-in-progress concerning the case. He begins receiving anonymous phone calls with heavy breathing. Because of his immersion in the case, Graysmith loses his job and his wife Melanie leaves him, taking their children with her. Graysmith acquires more information that points to Allen as the Zodiac, and although circumstantial evidence seems to indicate his guilt, the physical evidence, such as fingerprints and handwriting samples, do not implicate him.|$|E

5|$|Scotland Yard {{suspected}} Martin {{of having}} separately killed two men from south London: financial adviser Timothy MacDowall and accountant William Shackel. In Mexico, Martin had discussed {{with his wife}} about going scuba diving with MacDowall, who was taking scuba lessons while on holiday on an island off Belize. MacDowall disappeared in Belize in early 1995 but police could not conclusively match him to body parts later found in that country; the only suspicious activity they uncovered was the transfer of £21,000 from MacDowall's bank account to an account in San Francisco under Martin's name. MacDowall {{is believed to have}} been murdered as he slept and his remains thrown into a crocodile-infested river. Martin refused <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> by Scotland Yard while he was on death row in Changi Prison, thus whether he killed MacDowall remains unconfirmed. Shackel was reported missing while on holiday in Cancún, Mexico. Police reports said that Martin was in Cancún the day Shackel cashed traveller's cheques worth £4,000, after which he disappeared.|$|E

40|$|Pain is {{a common}} problem for older persons who need {{professional}} help for their daily living. In this study 94 older persons (75 +) in persistent pain were compared with 52 care providers concerning the pain management methods they had used/administered during the previous week and how helpful they perceived these methods <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> based on 16 items from the original version of the pain management inventory (PMI). Both groups perceived prescribed medication, rest and distraction as the most frequently utilized methods. Specific methods such as {{transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation}} (TENS) or bracing/splinting or bandaging the affected body part were seldom employed, although most users perceived these methods as helpful. Care providers perceived most methods for managing pain as more effective than older persons did. The results imply that care providers need skills in a variety of pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods to manage pain and a need to evaluate effectiveness of the methods in a systematic way...|$|R
