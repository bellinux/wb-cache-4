500|$|According to {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz, [...] "Kill Switch" [...] {{was the single}} most expensive episode that was filmed in Vancouver. In addition, the episode took a total of 22 days to film. The episode's bridge scenes were filmed at the Westham Island Bridge, which spans Canoe Pass, British Columbia. The location had been discovered by Carter during a <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> for the prior fifth season episode [...] "Schizogeny". Because the bridge was the sole means to access part of the Fraser River farming community in the area, filming was heavily restricted. Logistical issues with the bridge itself, such as restrictions on how many people could stand on the bridge at a time, also posed troubles for filming. Permission to film the scene wherein Esther throws the laptop into the river and it is subsequently vaporized by a laser strike from an orbiting weapons platform satellite required thirty days to obtain. The abandoned house that Mulder discovers was filmed at a historical landmark known locally as [...] "Read House".|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The widely {{automated}} {{analysis and}} evaluation of measurement processes is a still unsolved task in <b>technical</b> <b>surveying.</b> Complex measurement systems, increasing time pressure {{and more and more}} operators with non-academic background require the development of new strategies for a comprehensive and user-friendly presentation and explanation of quality information as part of the process. To solve these tasks, a possible way is the application of knowledge-based systems. The paper describes the development of a knowledge-based system for the automated evaluation of the quality of free stationing processes. One special focus is set on the complex knowledge acquisition and evaluation phase. A software prototype is presented that processes quality relevant information from hybrid sources and automati-cally reports the evaluation and explanation to the user. 1. AUTOMATION OF TECHNICAL SURVEYING PROCESSES- A DILEMMA When we look at the typical surveying processes taking place in many areas of <b>technical</b> <b>surveying,</b> we see reached a quite high degree of automation in data acquisition. But when we consider the whole process, including project preparation and data processing and evaluation, real life <b>technical</b> <b>surveying</b> processes are still far from being automated.

The rule was well known and officially enforced at the time. Fully automatic block control would have avoided the tragedy (flashing a red light at the passenger train), but up until the 1990s was installed only on high capacity main lines (about 1/8 of the total network).|$|E
50|$|The rats {{are able}} to search the ground more quickly (when {{compared}} to a manual deminer) and therefore rapidly confirm {{the presence or absence}} of mines. This process is termed, <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> (TS); the gathering of evidence through use of mine detection rats. The TS process also allows a more precise definition of the minefield boundaries and can release or cancel land outside these boundaries that were initially thought to be contaminated. This TS process is a more cost effective method to release mined areas as opposed to conducting full clearance over the entire area. For APOPO operations the rats are a key part to this process.|$|E
