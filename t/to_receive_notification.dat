5000|$|When Transformers: Age of Extinction {{launched}} an online Chinese casting contest for roles in four different categories in China {{during the summer}} of 2013, Wang emerged as the most popular contestant in the [...] "Action Guy" [...] category, from amongst 70,000 entrants. More than 500,000 people voted online for their favorite contenders, with Wang consistently in the lead for the [...] "Action Guy" [...] category, with more than 133,000 votes. Despite his popularity, Wang regretfully chose to eventually withdraw from the contest due to a conflict in KO One Re-act's filming schedule and Transformers 4's training schedule, choosing to honor his prior filming commitments in order not to hold up KO One Re-act's production team—which was still filming scenes and had already gone on-air in Taiwan and online in Mainland China. In his statement of withdrawal, published on the casting contest's website, Wang explained: [...] "I'm immensely grateful for all the support I've received during the Transformers 4 casting contest and am truly fortunate to have emerged first in the [...] "Action Guy" [...] category. I've been a Transformers fan since I was little, and closely followed the first three installments of the movie. Upon learning that M1905 Movie Web was organizing a casting contest for Chinese actors, I signed up immediately, hoping to fulfill my childhood dream of going into battle alongside Bumblebee (Transformers). I was pleasantly surprised by the overwhelming wave of support and votes I received, and was overjoyed <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>notification</b> from the organizers to begin the second round of training. Unfortunately, because I'm still {{in the midst of an}} ongoing, prior filming commitment, I have to honor those unfinished work commitments in order not to hold up the entire production team, and will thus have to regretfully give this training opportunity up." [...] During a media interview at a promotional event for the KO One Re-act television series, Wang reiterated his thanks for fans' warm support. Though his disappointment at the missed opportunity was palpable, he called the voting process a fantastic memory to have and to hold with his fans.|$|E

A skill can gen-erate its own events and notify them to other skills previ-ously registered at it in order <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>notification.</b> In order to increase the robots actuation capacity, it must ex-hibit a variety of different behaviors. For this, three dif-ferent methods for generating complex skills from simple ones are also proposed. ...|$|E

40|$|Ever had an {{experience}} of forgetting to do something very important on a place you just past?. Remembering, on arrival at your destination afterward, requires an action {{to return to the}} task location. This can be unproductive and perhaps result to frustration. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a “Location Task-To-Do manager” an android mobile application that will efficiently organizes task-to-do list and remind an individual to perform a task at a pre-defined location through notification and alert messages. The methods used includes,  investigation of pre-existing systems, requirement elicitation survey technique, three-tier architecture design pattern, iterative development life-cycle model, acceptance test plan and a sets of other technology such as  Java SDK, Android APIs, TCP/IP protocol, object oriented programing techniques and MySql relational database. The result showed that, installed “Location Task-To-Do manager” application on individual mobile devices/smartphones were capable of creating task, adding task, editing task, deleting task, sharing task and setting task location through its user friendly graphical interfaces. Users are able <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>notification</b> to perform a task within a minimum distance of 1 km to the exact task location...|$|E
