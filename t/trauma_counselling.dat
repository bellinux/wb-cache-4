40|$|M. A. One of {{the most}} perturbing factors of South Africa's {{communal}} existence is the high rates of violent crime and {{the high incidence of}} Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder JPTSD) amongst all communities. Crime-related PTSD is a problem of epidemic proportions. Therapeutic and mental health services for <b>trauma</b> related <b>counselling</b> are limited and in some communities non-existent. It is therefor essential to develop preventative programmes aimed at equipping individuals with the skills to avoid possible trauma-inducing situations such as vehicle hijacking. It was decided to utilise a vehicle hijacking management and -prevention programme developed especially for the purposes of a "short course" intervention approach. The experimental intervention was performed to provide skill and increase levels of personal competence in handling, or, ideally, avoiding a hijacking. A sample group of 35 was selected out of a white upper middle-class, middle aged population. The subjects were exposed to the intervention. The results indicated that the intervention produced significant positive change in self-efficacy beliefs in the experimental groups. Possible limitations of the study were sample sizes and the inherent nature of the groups. It was not possible {{to examine the relationship between}} sex and efficacy beliefs. No non-whites subjects were utilised and thus the relationship between race and efficacy beliefs was also not examined.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Pastoral)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. South Africa, {{after ten}} years of {{democracy}} {{should have been a}} secure and peaceful place. It has however developed into a cesspool of violence. Violent crime is currently a common factor in everyday life. It is especially the severe nature of the assault and mutilation that makes violent crimes so traumatizing. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the need for counselling of these traumatized victims of violent crimes and to design a future strategy for the possible application by pastoral counsellors and ministers to support and minister these violent crime victims. The method of approach according to which this study was done, is the practical theological model of Getz where the different perspectives was studied through lenses. From the above mentioned survey it became evident that violent crimes are still increasing and the subsequent trauma received very little attention up to now. Empirical research clearly suggested that although these victims needed pastoral counselling, they did not receive any form 293 of counselling. With the help of the pastoral counsellor these violent crime victims can overcome <b>trauma.</b> Pastoral <b>counselling</b> to the traumatized victim of violent crime is carried out by the counsellor, a called servant of God, using Scripturally founded pastoral skills in counselling, in this way creating a pastoral relationship. The aim is to lead the counselee towards growth in belief in God in order to handle this through faith. The conclusion reached after the research had been taken is that traumatized victims of violent crimes did not receive counselling from their ministers. The trauma that is caused by violent crimes has a fierce impact on victims and this research, with the aid of the pastoral model, might help victims to carry on their daily lives in honour of God.

5000|$|The 51 tsunami {{affected}} {{villages in}} Cuddalore District, Tamil Nadu, are geographically removed from urbanization. These villages {{had not been}} exposed to the effects of Globalisation before the tsunami. The fishing community, in these villages, is a very “closed community” that does not broach interaction even with neighboring communities except for their trade. Therefore, the biggest obstacle to any kind of psychosocial intervention was the community’s lack of openness to “outsiders”. This accentuated the role of ethnocentricism that has been recognized as the single most powerful impediment to <b>trauma</b> <b>counselling</b> and which probably represents the vestiges of an ancient avoidance of strangers (Chemtob,1997). Thus such “closed communities” tend to assume that their experience of the world “is the world”. An influx of the “outside world”, such as {{in the aftermath of a}} natural disaster, could be an impediment or an advantage. It could either make the community withdraw into itself, or develop a bond with the outside world that has seen and experienced a similar peril. According to the National Organization for Victim Assistance (NOVA), Washington, D.C, likelihood of defensiveness will be high, based on pre-exposure conditioning, due to the need for security and social resonance.

40|$|People {{all over}} the world do {{experience}} some kind of trauma during their lives. Some may experience more than one trauma, and some may experience more intense trauma, but sooner or later we all experience trauma. Sadly, our children are not excluded. The first aim of this study, was to investigate the influence of trauma on the lives of children in their mid childhood years. The following questions were asked: · What are the specific developmental tasks for middle childhood, regarding their physical, cognitive, affective, social, religious, moral and esthetical development? · What about trauma is so traumatic? · Are there any recognisable and predicted effects, present in children who experienced trauma? · And last, but not least, how do children understand and experience a traumatic death? The second aim {{of this study was to}} develop a <b>trauma</b> <b>counselling</b> program for children who experienced a trauma. The program had to focus on the specific needs of children in their mid childhood years. In order to do this, the following points were looked at: · What is the current understanding of trauma? Are there any counselling programs for children available, and how do they work? · There are a vast majority of intervention techniques available, the most popular techniques – playtherapy, bibliotherapy, grouptherapy, arttherapy and narrative therapy, were briefly discussed. · Finally a graphic presentation of a new <b>trauma</b> <b>counselling</b> program was included. To see whether this <b>trauma</b> <b>counselling</b> program could help children to overcome posttraumatic symptoms and prevent posttraumatic stress-disorder, it was implemented during two case studies. · The first case study was a girl that had been bitten by dogs twice. As a result of this trauma, she developed an unnatural fear of dogs. The <b>trauma</b> <b>counselling</b> program was implemented, and after a few weeks the girl was able to conquer and control her fear of dogs. · The second case study was a boy who needed to accept his father’s suicide. The <b>trauma</b> <b>counselling</b> program was adapted to suit his specific needs, and once again the program helped the boy to understand and accept his father’s suicide. The success of these two case studies, lead to the acceptance of this study’s hypothesis, namely, that if one developed a <b>trauma</b> <b>counselling</b> program that are compatible with the needs of children in their mid childhood years, it will help children to accept and overcome trauma. Therefore posttraumatic stress symptoms will be reduced and post-traumatic disorder will be prevented.

It is specially farm attacks that in the recent time show an increase. At the moment there are 274 farmers per 100 000 {{of the population in}} comparison with for example 153 policemen per 100 000, that are being murdered each year. In this study, a <b>trauma</b> <b>counselling</b> program is established, especially to give social support to victims of farm attacks. There are different reasons why a <b>trauma</b> <b>counselling</b> program for victims of farm attacks bas to be established: Farm attacks increase rapidly, - more than any other crimes. Farm attacks and - murder are brutal and gruesome. The farm attackers focus on torture and the infliction of severe pain and suffering. The fear that is inspired by this, leads to the termination of basic assumptions such as, that people are invulnerable, that there is a reason for everything happening and that something good will come forth. The termination of these basic assumptions lead to long term bio psychological changes {{in the life of the}} victim, his/her family and loved ones that saw or heard about the attack. This form of traumatization needs counselling. The purpose of this research was to determine the traumatic experience and the needs of victims after a farm attack. Through explanatory, descriptive, and exploratory evaluative research a way to establish and to guide the victims to take control of their lives, on the same level of social functioning as before the attack, is suggested. In this study the focus were on the following goals: Knowledge has to be gathered about the intensity of the attack and post traumatic stress reaction To achieve this aim a questionnaire for victims of farm attacks in the Northwest province has been designed and completed. The results show that there is a need for a <b>trauma</b> <b>counselling</b> program for victims of farm attacks.

40|$|Early {{interventions}} for trauma aim {{to reduce the}} likelihood of distress and impairment following exposure to a traumatic event. However, {{a growing body of research}} suggests that some popular early interventions have the potential to increase the risk of psychological sequelae. This risk maybe increased when such interventions are delivered by practitioners with limited skill and training. This thesis discusses the development and training of the 2 ̆ 7 Orienting Approach 2 ̆ 7 to <b>Trauma</b> <b>Counselling</b> (Phipps and Byme, 2003). This early intervention was designed for use by volunteer counsellors. It is argued that the approach is a 2 ̆ 7 no-harm 2 ̆ 7 intervention that can reduce the potential for distress and impairment of individuals who have been both directly and indirectly exposed to traumatic events. Eighty volunteer counsellors participated in a one-day training program. The capacity of volunteers to administer the approach was evaluated. Skill was assessed by participation in blind-rated role-plays both before and after training. Knowledge was assessed pre and post-training using a multiple choice questionnaire. This thesis also aimed to investigate variables which may affect counsellors 2 ̆ 7 ability to administer the approach. Since working with traumatised individuals has the potential to 2 ̆ 7 vicariously 2 ̆ 7 traumatise counsellors, the influence of personal trauma experience on volunteers 2 ̆ 7 performance with the approach was explored.

40|$|Previous {{research}} in northern Uganda found {{high levels of}} trauma-related difficulties amongst the conflict-affected population. There is international evidence that psychological therapy can reduce depression, {{as one of the}} psychological effects of trauma, but very limited literature regarding the experiences of <b>trauma</b> <b>counselling</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa. The current British Academy and Leverhulme-funded {{research in}}vestigated the experiences of service users and providers of trauma services in Kitgum and Gulu, northern Uganda. It also examined their implications for mental health policy and legislation. A decision was made to utilise qualitative methodology to highlight the in-depth experiences of participants. The researcher's carried out interviews with 10 women and 10 men survivors attending trauma services in Kitgum and Gulu. The researchers also interviewed 15 key informants in Kitgum, Gulu and Kampala including <b>trauma</b> <b>counselling</b> service providers, ministers, cultural leaders and mental health professionals. The authors report the findings of the research based on thematic analysis of the interviews. Themes included the experiences of survivors, bearing witness and instilling hope, constraints to service provision, stigma and abuse, holistic approach, service providers doing their best, specialist populations, limited understanding, training and skills development, gaps in service provision and mental health policy and legislation. The interviews resulted in a clear indication that counselling and medication was valued by service users, and that service providers felt the treatments that were provided improved depression, and increased empowerment and engagement in social activities. However, the authors argue that there was a limit to the benefits that could be achieved without using the holistic approach that the survivors requested. Thus, in cases of trauma arising from conflict, there is a clear need for the state to ensure reparation and/or justice for the atrocities witnessed by and perpetrated against survivors. This might include the provision of compensation, which would help to meet social needs and reduce feelings of shame and anger...|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} South African context {{there is a}} strong {{likelihood}} of the occurrence of trauma incidents that involve people of different races. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this has contributed to the increased expression of negative racial sentiments by victims of trauma, especially in crime related trauma, when the perpetrator/s are of a different race group to the victim. This research study locates itself within the small number of studies that have sought to engage with the problem of negative racial sentiments as a response to trauma. This study focused particularly on the observations, explanations and interventions of volunteer counsellors in having to engage with this content in traumatized clients. The study sought to understand the impact that the expression of negative racial sentiments had on the process of <b>trauma</b> <b>counselling</b> and debriefing and on counsellors personally. The research was operationalized within a hermeneutically oriented qualitative research framework. The participant group was comprised of 11 volunteer counsellors from different parts of Johannesburg and from different organizations. Participants were chosen through purposive sampling and face to face semi-structured interviews were used as the method of data collection. Thematic content analysis was employed to analyze the interview texts. The findings suggest that negative racial sentiments are a commonly occurring response following a trauma. Counsellors predominantly understand negative racial sentiments {{to be part of the}} trauma symptom pattern, in that they explain such responses as ‘trigger’ reactions. Counsellors also understood the sentiments to represent pre-existing prejudice, exaggerated and re-evoked by the trauma. The findings indicate that counsellors were developing and utilizing skills and interventions mainly of their own design in engaging with negative racial sentiments, as they are generally not trained on how to engage with this content in <b>trauma</b> <b>counselling.</b> Counsellors use interventions such as normalizing, psychoeducation and CBT based interventions when they do intervene, but in some cases make a choice not to intervene. Counsellors reported considerable discomfort and suggested that although case by case intervention was important, some guidance as to how to work in this area would be useful.

40|$|Objective to {{describe}} the development and application of a brief counselling intervention for women who have experienced a traumatic birth. Intervention the birthing <b>trauma</b> <b>counselling</b> model reflecting women's need to establish a therapeutic connection with a midwife, talk about their birth experience and have their feelings validated. Gaps in understanding of events need explanation and explicit connections made between the event and subsequent emotions and behaviours. Developing a rational understanding of birthing events and how labour may have been managed differently assists women to revise their assumptions about maternity care and gain a sense of control. Fostering social support, reinforcing positive approaches to coping and exploring solutions to restoring self-confidence and reducing anxiety may help re-establish psychological equilibrium. Discussion and conclusion the counselling intervention is consistent with trauma theory and draws on cognitive behavioural therapy principles.
