5|$|Al-Qassam {{concentrated}} {{his activities}} on the lower classes, setting up a night school for casual laborers and preaching to them as an imam, first in the Jerini Mosque, {{and later in the}} Istiqlal Mosque. He would seek <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets, in brothels and hashish dens. His greatest following came from the landless ex-tenant farmers drifting into Haifa from the Upper Galilee where purchases of agricultural land by the Jewish National Fund and Hebrew labor policies excluding Arabs had dispossessed many of their traditional livelihoods. Al-Qassam grew increasingly popular with northern Palestine's poorer Muslims and was frequently sought out to preach at Mawlid celebrations.|$|E
5|$|McCudden was {{determined}} his machine {{would remain in}} first-class fighting order. He spent three days working with his fitters and armourers, stripping down the Vickers gun's synchronising gear, firing at the butts and making eight test flights shooting at ground targets. His armourers joked that his guns would never work in the air if he wore <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. He continued to experience jams and his unclaimed victim of 14 September 1917—Ernst Wiegand—was able to escape and crash-land wounded in German territory thanks to another stoppage. Since his crash was not witnessed his claim went uncredited.|$|E

25|$|Utilizing the wildcat formation, Shaq Washington {{rushed for}} a {{touchdown}} within the first minute of the final quarter of play, pulling the Bearcats within 19. On the ensuing kickoff, CINCY recovered a fumble from T. J. Logan, fueling momentum for the Bearcats, who started at the 6-yard line. They started in the wildcat, but when faced with third and goal at the eight-yard line, Kay returned at quarterback and completed a pass, but it was short of the end zone; the Bearcats went for it on fourth down, and Kay threw a pass that bounced off {{the hands of his}} intended target, and thus, they turned the ball over. Looking to milk the clock on their ensuing drive, UNC achieved a first down prior to losing six yards on a rush to set up third down and long; a pass interference bailed <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third and long play, as though the pass was incomplete, the 15-yard penalty gave them an automatic first down. They succeeded in their endeavor to drain time from the clock, ultimately executing a 14-play drive that gained 74 yards and lasted 9:19, and culminated with a 40-yard field goal to complete the scoring.|$|E
25|$|In January 1806 Franchise {{was under}} the command of Captain Charles Dashwood. He {{received}} information that several Spanish vessels had anchored in the Bay of Campeche and he determined to try to cut <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> night of 6 January Franchise arrived some five leagues off the town of Campeche and Dashwood had her anchor in four fathoms as the water was too shallow to come any closer. He then sent in three of Franchises boats {{under the command of}} Lieutenants John Fleming and Peter Douglas, his first and third lieutenants, and Lieutenant Mends of the Marines. Because of the distance they had to row, the British were unable to approach closely until 4am, by which time the moon had risen, they had been spotted, and the Spaniards alerted. The Spanish vessels consisted of two naval brigs, one of 20 guns and 180 men, and another of 12 guns and 90 men, a schooner armed with eight guns, and seven gunboats, each armed with two guns. They opened fire on the approaching row boats and might have destroyed the attack had Lieutenant Fleming not led his three boats to the smaller of the brigs and boarded her. After about ten minutes of hand-to-hand fighting, the British had captured her and were sailing her out, pursued by the other Spanish vessels, which continued to fire on them. The British returned fire from their prize and their boats and the Spanish vessels withdrew.|$|E

[...] The gutters around the hospital ran red with blood. [...] The woman had not just been attacked with a machete, but her entire body rationally and systematically mutilated. [...] Her ears had been cut off. [...] And her face had been so carefully disfigured that a pattern was obvious in the slashes. [...] She was one among many — living an inhuman and simply indescribable suffering. [...] We could do little more for her at the moment than stop the bleeding with a few necessary sutures. [...] We were completely overwhelmed, and she knew that there were so many others. [...] She said to me in the clearest voice I have ever heard, 'Allez, allez…ummera, ummerasha' — 'Go, go…my friend, find and let live your courage.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{extensive}} underground workings, {{no more than}} one waterwheel was used for pumping water out of the mine. The first waterwheel, whose wheelpit can still be seen just {{to the north of the}} main track, was built in 1814–15 and was powered by water carried by a leat that curved around the south side of Higher Hartor Tor drawing water from the upper reaches of the River Plym. In 1818 this leat, known as Engine Leat, was extended over the Plym to also collect water from the Langcombe Brook, a tributary on its south bank. Another leat built in the 1820s attempted to collect water from the hillside to the north. That the water supply was still inadequate at times is shown by the construction, before 1825, of a large linear reservoir on the line of the main leat, the northern end of which is now cut off by the main track which used to pass over it by a bridge. This reservoir was up to [...] wide and up to [...] deep and its [...] long dam was about [...] thick and reinforced with substantial granite blocks on the inner face.
