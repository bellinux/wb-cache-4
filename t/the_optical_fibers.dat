40|$|Optical {{time domain}} reflectometry(OTDR) {{has been applied}} and become an {{important}} branch {{in the development of}} monitoring technique since 1990. In such systems, optical fibers were usually treated as sensors and signal transferring media simultaneously. Moreover, most of <b>the</b> <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> were fixed within massive material to detect the initiation and propagation of cracks. Attaching optical fibers on structural surfaces to monitor the progressive change of an existing gape is another possible application. How to guide the route of the fiber without energy loss becomes the key issue. This paper reports recent research results that provide solutions for such problems by winding <b>the</b> <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> around circular columns of various diameters. Since OTDR measurements are extremely sensitive to the energy loss of the pulses which is a one-to-one function of the radius of the circular path of the fiber. While the radius of the columns are greater than 10 mm, no loss occur. Such columns could be used to guide the direction for the fibers. On the other hand, sensors could be made by winding <b>the</b> <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> around columns with diameters between 6 mm and 10 mm. In such conditions, each location could be clearly indicated through the energy loss on OTDR systems. 自 1990 年以來，利用光時域反射技術(Optical Time Domain Reflectometry OTDR) 同 時以光纖維作為信號發生器與信號傳輸工具，已逐漸成為監測科技發展的重要方向之一，但 以往多將光纖埋置於監測材料中進行之。至於將光纖依附於結構體表面，以監測結構元件間 有限寬度縫隙變化，未有相關研究。困難點之一，即在於如何控制光纖佈設路徑，使其在固 定及轉折時，不發生能量損失。為克服這些問題，本文介紹一系列以纏繞不同直徑圓柱的方 式，固定光纖方法的研究成果。主要原理在於：當光纖纏繞不同直徑圓柱時，即代表光纖路 徑發生不同曲率的改變，經光時域反射技術量測通過的光脈波，可定位纏繞點；經比較能量 損失值及損失模式，可歸納出激發各種信號的對映圓柱半徑與纏繞角度。結果顯示，圓柱直 徑大於 20 mm時，多圈或部份纏繞，可以令架空光纖固定或轉向，且不造成光脈波能量改 變，但當被纏繞的圓柱直徑介於 6 mm至 10 mm時，則視直徑之大小及纏繞的角度，會有不 同程度的能量衰減，可用以設計基本的監測感應元件...|$|E
