5|$|Ernest Augustus, {{the fifth}} son of King George III and Queen Charlotte, {{was born at}} Buckingham House, now part of Buckingham Palace, on 5 June 1771. After leaving the nursery, {{he lived with his}} <b>two</b> <b>younger</b> brothers, Prince Adolphus (later Duke of Cambridge) and Prince Augustus (later Duke of Sussex), and a tutor in a house on Kew Green, near his parents' {{residence}} at Kew Palace. At the age of fifteen, he and his <b>two</b> <b>younger</b> brothers were sent to the University of Göttingen, located in his father's domain of Hanover. Though the King never left the United Kingdom in his life, he sent his younger sons to Germany in their adolescence. According to the historian John Van der Kiste, this was done to limit the influence Ernest's eldest brother George, Prince of Wales, who was leading an extravagant lifestyle, would have over his younger brothers. Prince Ernest proved an apt student, and after being tutored privately for a year, while learning German, he attended lectures at the University. Though King George ordered that the princes' household be run along military lines, and that they follow the university's rules, the merchants of the Electorate proved willing to extend credit to the princes, and all three fell into debt.|$|E
