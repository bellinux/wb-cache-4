But that is the emotion—subterranean, powerful, beautiful, illicit, and infinitely patient—that suffuses the pages of Khaled Hosseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns. As in his best-selling first novel, The Kite Runner, Hosseini movingly examines the connections between unlikely friends, the fissures that open up between parents and children, the intransigence of quiet hearts." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Morse portrayed George Washington in the HBO miniseries John Adams, {{for which}} {{his nose was}} made bigger. Morse commented: [...] "The first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> to mind is my nose; it was my big idea to do that nose. We didn't {{have a lot of}} time, because they asked me to do this about three weeks before they started shooting, and I just kept looking at these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. And I did not feel that my face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that we should try the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went 'wow, that's Washington'." [...] Morse's portrayal earned him his second Emmy Award nomination. He is currently reprising the role of Washington in voice form as part of The Hall of Presidents show in Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|In the {{execution}} scene which follows, a theme emerges, the incessant repetition of which reminded Newman of the Transformation Music which separates {{the two parts}} of act1 in Wagner's Parsifal. In the final bars, as Tosca evades Spoletta and leaps to her death, the theme of [...] "E lucevan le stelle" [...] is played tutta forze (as loudly as possible). This choice of ending has been strongly criticised by analysts, mainly because of its specific association with Cavaradossi rather than Tosca. Joseph Kerman mocked the final music, [...] "Tosca leaps, and the orchestra screams the first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> into its head." [...] Budden, however, argues that it is entirely logical to end this dark opera on its blackest theme. According to historian and former opera singer Susan Vandiver Nicassio: [...] "The conflict between the verbal and the musical clues gives {{the end of the}} opera a twist of controversy that, barring some unexpected discovery among Puccini's papers, can never truly be resolved." ...|$|E

We don't see any other motive for this terrible crime." [...] He said Politkovskaya gave an interview to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty last week in which {{she said she was}} a witness in a criminal case against Ramzan Kadyrov in connection with abductions in Chechnya - a case based on her reporting. [...] In that same interview, she called Kadyrov the [...] "Stalin of our days".|$|E
2500|$|Joel Coen {{seems to}} agree. In an {{interview}} with David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph, Gritten states that [...] "overall [...] seems to belong in a rarefied category of Coen films occupied only by Fargo (1996), which ... is also a crime story with a decent small-town sheriff as its central character. Joel sighs. 'I know. There are parallels.' He shakes his head. 'These things really should seem obvious to us.'" [...] In addition, Ethan Coen states that [...] "we're not conscious of it, [...] {{to the extent that}} we are, we try to avoid it. The similarity to Fargo did occur to us, not that it was a good or a bad thing. That's the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> to mind as being reminiscent of our own movies, [...] it is by accident." ...|$|E
