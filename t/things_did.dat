5|$|The 1919 {{season began}} with high expectations; World War I was over, and key players had {{returned}} from service. However, <b>things</b> <b>did</b> not go Warner's way; {{at the beginning of}} the season, problems with the offensive line and on the flanks became apparent. Their first defeat was at Syracuse, where the Orangemen won 20–3. The 1919 Panthers had six wins, two losses and one tie.|$|E
5|$|<b>Things</b> <b>did</b> {{not stay}} {{peaceful}} for long. On December 17, 1931, Charles Nelson shot partner John Dykas in the back, killing him. Trapper Nelson, angered by his step-brother's actions, testified against {{him at the}} trial for Dykas' murder. Charles was given a 20-year sentence at Raiford Prison. Disillusioned with civilization, Nelson withdrew from the beach, settling deep in the woods on the Loxahatchee River that same December. Using what little money he had and money borrowed from his sister, he bought 800acres.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, the Deutsche Eisenbahnbaugesellschaft (German Railway Construction Company - DEG) {{filed the}} {{planning}} {{application for a}} railway line through the city, connecting the then-Schlesischer Bahnhof (today Berlin Ostbahnhof) to Charlottenburg, and continuing to Potsdam. In December 1873, the state of Prussia {{as well as the}} private rail enterprises Berlin-Potsdamer Eisenbahn, Magdeburg-Halberstädter Eisenbahn and Berlin-Hamburger Bahn bought shares in the DEG, and jointly founded the Berliner Stadteisenbahngesellschaft (Berlin City Railway Company). However, <b>things</b> <b>did</b> not go as expected and the DEG went into bankruptcy in 1878, which forced the Prussian state government to take over operations, pay for the construction of the line with state money and to reimburse the former private owners of the DEG. The state's interest in the line was attributed to the military, which after the 1870-1871 Franco-Prussian War was of the opinion that the railway networks would hinder mobilisation when not properly interconnected.|$|E

5|$|At Unforgiven, Christian {{defeated}} Edge {{to win the}} Intercontinental Championship {{but lost}} it back to Edge a month later at No Mercy in a ladder match. Christian resumed a singles career by winning the WWF European Championship from Bradshaw in October 2001. On November 3 at Rebellion, Christian faced Edge in a steel cage match for the Intercontinental Championship but failed to win the title. At Survivor Series, Christian defeated Al Snow to retain the European Championship. At Vengeance, Christian and Test faced Scotty 2 Hotty and Albert in a losing effort. He lost the European title to Diamond Dallas Page in January 2002. At Royal Rumble, Christian entered the royal rumble match where he was eliminated by Steve Austin. At No Way Out, Christian and Lance Storm entered a Tag Team Turmoil match with the winners getting a tag title shot at Wrestlemania which was won by The APA. After a series of defeats, Christian announced he would quit the WWF, but Page persuaded him to reconsider, and adopted him as his protégé. Christian betrayed Page and faced off against him for the European championship at the WrestleMania X8 event on March 17, 2002, in which Page defeated him. He began throwing tantrums in his gimmick at the time whenever <b>things</b> <b>did</b> not go his way. During the same event, Christian defeated Mighty Molly to win the WWF Hardcore Championship, but lost the title to Maven later that night.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2015–16 season, the Rockets {{acquired}} Ty Lawson {{from the}} Denver Nuggets {{in exchange for}} Joey Dorsey, Nick Johnson, Kostas Papanikolaou, Pablo Prigioni, and a 2016 first round draft pick. Expectations were high for the Rockets coming into the season. Lawson {{was supposed to take}} some of the ball-handling pressures off of Harden, and they were bringing back nearly the same team that made it to the Western Conference Finals the previous year. However, <b>things</b> <b>did</b> not go according to plan. Kevin McHale was fired at the beginning of the season after the Rockets only won 4 of their first 11 games. J. B. Bickerstaff, his assistant, took over the head coaching duties. The Rockets struggled to remain in the playoff contention throughout the season due to inconsistent play and injuries. Lawson was waived mid-season in a buyout agreement. Houston only clinched the eight seed in the 2016 playoffs by beating the Kings in the last game of the regular season. In the first round of the playoffs, the Rockets played the Warriors, who were coming off a record-breaking regular season. The Rockets once again lost to the Warriors in 5 games.|$|E
5|$|The {{recruitment}} of Chris Dawes during the 2012 trade period meant Watts would remain playing in defence for the 2013 season according to Mark Neeld; former Melbourne player, David Schwarz, said {{prior to the}} commencement of the season that Watts would flourish in defence {{and that he would}} ultimately become a consistent player. The opening round loss to Port Adelaide by seventy-nine points at the MCG where he managed just seven disposals saw the players booed by Melbourne fans as they left the field; <b>things</b> <b>did</b> not become easier the next week when the club lost to Essendon by 148-points at the MCG, a game in which he was substituted out and was jeered by the crowd when this was announced. His poor to start to the season led to him being dropped for the round three match against West Coast at the MCG; instead of playing for Casey in the VFL, he did not play any football for the weekend. Despite not playing and football for the week, he was recalled to the senior side for the forty-one point win against Greater Western Sydney at the MCG in round four.|$|E

25|$|<b>Things</b> <b>did</b> {{not proceed}} as planned, however. While in Slobodka, Hillman began to {{regularly}} attend the secret meetings of an illegal study circle {{headed by a}} local druggist. The study circle's members read radical literature and books on political economy, and Hillman was here exposed to the works of Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer in Russian translation.|$|E
25|$|Peled's first direct {{involvement}} in a political party was in 1977 with {{the foundation of the}} short-lived Left Camp of Israel party, whose platform focused on advocating peace negotiations with the Palestinians.

Rosenberg and the Lassaleans were apparently physically ejected from the party headquarters and the parties newspapers, funds and property were taken over by the new NEC.|$|E
25|$|<b>Things</b> <b>did</b> {{not change}} for the Assyrians in Iraq until the {{outbreak}} of World War II, when the Iraqis revolted under Rashid Ali al-Kaylani who sided himself with Germany and wanted to force the British out of Iraq completely.

The first edition of the novel sold around 14,300 copies, only a couple hundred more than its predecessor, Tik-Tok of Oz—though {{in the long run}} The Scarecrow of Oz {{would be one of the}} more popular installments in the Oz series.|$|E

25|$|Batistuta signed {{professional}} {{forms with}} Newell's Old Boys, whose manager was Marcelo Bielsa, {{who would later}} become Batistuta's national coach with the Argentina national team. <b>Things</b> <b>did</b> not come easily for Batistuta during his first year with the club. He was away from home, his family, and his girlfriend Irina, sleeping in {{a room at the}} stadium, and had a weight problem that slowed his progress. At the end of that year, Batistuta was loaned to a smaller team, Deportivo Italiano, with whom he participated in the Carnevale Cup in Italy, ending as top scorer with three goals.|$|E
25|$|McCarthy again moved onto a new country, as {{he joined}} Lyon in July 1989. However, <b>things</b> <b>did</b> {{not work out}} for the defender in France and, feeling his {{international}} chances were being harmed, he returned to England on loan with top flight Millwall in March 1990. Despite the London side suffering relegation during his loan period, McCarthy impressed enough to earn a move and he was signed permanently in May 1990 for £200,000. His appearances {{in the next two}} seasons were often limited by injuries and he effectively retired from playing when he took over as manager of the club in 1992.|$|E
25|$|The {{first session}} on Friday evening was shared, with both team winning 3 points each, {{and on the}} Saturday afternoon, Team Europe took the lead 7-5, before {{collapsing}} 5-1 in the evening session to trail 10-8 {{after the end of}} day 2. <b>Things</b> <b>did</b> not improve for the Europeans on the Sunday, and they continued to trail 14-10 after the afternoon session. The final session started brightly for Team Europe, as they won the first 2 points, however a strong team effort from the Americans thwarted any comeback as they won 3 of the last 4 points, including the final baker team game, to claim victory once more.|$|E

25|$|Riding the {{momentum}} of their late season run, on April 4 the Drillers went into Milwaukee and hammered the Wave {{in the first game}} of their best-of-three series 20–6. This game is also notable as the first game ever on the radio, as the locale station CKER agree to broadcast the playoff away games, with PR man Bruce Rakoczy and assistant coach Sean Fleming doing the play-by-play and commentary. <b>Things</b> <b>did</b> not go without a hitch though, {{and as a result of}} technical difficulties, the listening public was left listening to polka music for more than three quarters of the game before things finally got sorted out.|$|E
25|$|The year 1929 {{marked a}} major {{turn in the}} Communist Party of the United States of America. Party leader Jay Lovestone, having won a massive {{factional}} victory over the Chicago-based rival group headed by William Z.

Lovestone headed a 10-member delegation to Moscow to appeal his case to the American Commission of ECCI; <b>things</b> <b>did</b> not go well for him and in the squabble over autonomy Lovestone attempted a factional coup involving the seizure of party assets.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1996, the Astros again nearly left Houston. By the mid-1990s, McLane (like McMullen before him) {{wanted his}} team {{out of the}} Astrodome and was asking the city to build the Astros a new stadium. When <b>things</b> <b>did</b> not {{progress}} quickly toward that end, he put the team up for sale. He had nearly finalized a deal to sell the team to businessman William Collins, who planned to move them to Northern Virginia. However, Collins was having difficulty finding a site for a stadium himself, so Major League owners stepped in and forced McLane to give Houston another chance to grant his stadium wish. Houston voters responded positively via a stadium referendum and the Astros stayed put.|$|E
