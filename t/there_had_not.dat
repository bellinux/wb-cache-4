5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from coaching, Nash {{became involved in}} the sporting media. He wrote a column for the Sporting Globe newspaper, spoke at sportsmans' nights and made regular television appearances, including on World of Sport, to comment on Australian rules football and point out that <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been a player of his ability in the VFL since {{his retirement}}.|$|E
5|$|At Beijing, four athletes {{competed for}} the Cook Islands. Of those competitors, three were men (Heather, Okotai, Pera) {{and one was}} a woman (Tapoki). They competed across three sports (track and field, {{swimming}} and weightlifting) and four distinct events (men's 100meters and women's discus throw in track and field, men's 100meters breaststroke in swimming, and men's heavyweight in weightlifting). As of the 2008 Olympics, <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been a Cook Islander who has won a medal at the Olympics.

5|$|In 2002, Triumph International had {{to close}} its factory in Myanmar due to public pressure. The Berne Declaration and Clean Clothes Campaign accused the company of renting land from the country's {{military}} regime and thus indirectly supporting it. In January 2002, Triumph International {{announced that it would}} close the affected factory and offer a social plan for the remaining employees because no buyer had been found. Moreover, Triumph International clarified that <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been any forced laborers among the employees.|$|E
5|$|Besides these {{international}} initiatives, {{some countries}} {{are taking their}} own actions. New Zealand has banned the taking of manta rays since {{the introduction of the}} Wildlife Act in 1953. In June 1995, the Maldives banned the export of all ray species and their body parts, effectively putting a stop to manta fishing as <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> previously been a fishery for local consumption. The government reinforced this in 2009 with the introduction of two marine protected areas. In the Philippines, the taking of mantas was banned in 1998, but this was overturned in 1999 under pressure from local fishermen. Fish stocks were surveyed in 2002, and the ban was reintroduced. The taking or killing of mantas in Mexican waters was prohibited in 2007. This ban may not be strictly enforced, but laws are being more rigidly applied at Isla Holbox, an island off the Yucatán Peninsula, where manta rays are used to attract tourists.|$|E

5|$|By this time, cricket {{had been}} {{introduced}} to India, North America and the West Indies but the first definite references occur in the 18th century. In 1709, cricket was played by William Byrd of Westover on his James River estates in Virginia, then a British colony. This is the earliest reference to cricket being played in the New World. <b>There</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been any English colonisation of Australasia or southern Africa, where Test cricket is played now, by 1725. Australia and New Zealand had been partly explored by Abel Tasman in the 1640s but still had only their Aboriginal and Maori inhabitants respectively. The first European settlement in South Africa was founded on Tuesday, 6 April 1652 when the Dutch East India Company established Cape Colony on Table Bay, near present-day Cape Town.|$|E
5|$|Despite German {{claims that}} the {{blockage}} did not impede their operations, the operation to close the Ostend canal {{seemed to have been}} at least partially successful. The channel was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off from the open sea, even if the position of the blockship meant that smaller ships could get through. In fact, the entire operation had been rendered moot before it even began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge. British assessments of that operation had proven optimistic and the channel <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been properly closed. Small coastal submarines of the UC class had been able to pass through the channel as early as the morning after the Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able to dredge channels around the blockages at both ports over the coming weeks.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{following}} the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, 244 vehicles of the Czechoslovak Army were {{seized by the}} Germans where they were known as the L.T.M.35 until January 1940. In German service, they were used as substitutes for the Panzerkampfwagen III medium tank. They {{were assigned to the}} Panzer Battalion (Panzerabteilung) 65 (39) of the 1st Light (leichte) Division and the independent Panzer-Regiment 11 (81) where they participated in the Invasion of Poland. 77 of these were lost during the campaign, mostly due to mechanical breakdowns, but only 7 of these were irreparable. From 1940 on, <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been any spare parts available and tanks had to be completely rebuilt to remain operational.|$|E

5|$|That year, {{the academy}} fielded its first {{competitive}} football team. Although football had seen some popularity at the school, <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been an organized effort to establish it. Two different teams were assembled in 1879; only first-classmen (final-year students) {{were allowed to}} join the teams. Cabaniss joined the second team as a rusher, {{the equivalent of a}} modern-day offensive lineman. He played alongside future admiral Hugh Rodman and eventual Governor of Guam William John Maxwell. The academy's team played one game, a scoreless tie with the nearby Baltimore Athletic Club. Navy's rushers forced the Baltimore A.C. backwards into their own end zone for safeties on three separate occasions, and generally outplayed and overpowered their opponents the entire game.|$|E
5|$|The High Court's {{decision}} was overruled by the Court of Appeal. The Court {{held that the}} Registrar had given genuine consideration to Komoco's arguments. It found that the Registrar had been entitled to take, prima facie, the Customs' OMV figures as correct unless they had {{been shown to be}} incorrect. Although the Registrar had been disposed to follow the Customs' OMV, she had equally been concerned to find out whether there had been sufficient reasons for her not to follow the administrative convention. Komoco had neither challenged the sworn evidence given by the Registrar by applying to cross-examine her, nor adduced any evidence to disprove the Registrar's sworn statement. There was thus no merit in Komoco's contention that the Registrar had not given genuine consideration to its representation. Furthermore, Komoco had not provided new evidence not already presented to the Customs to justify a departure from the administrative convention. Therefore, <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been any compelling reason for the Registrar to re-evaluate her decision. She had adequately justified her refusal to depart from the policy, and had not fettered her discretion.|$|E
5|$|The first Solomon Islander {{delegation}} to the Olympics arrived some six years after the nation's independence for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, and was composed of three male athletes competing in two sports. The island nation continued to send delegations to the Olympics throughout its era of civil disorder; delegations from the Solomon Islands appeared at all seven Summer Olympic games prior to (and including) the Beijing games of 2008. The first women represented the Solomon Islands at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. The largest delegations from the Solomon Islands included four athletes and appeared in 1988 and 1996.

5|$|The first {{proposals}} for an airport on Værøy were {{launched by the}} government in the late 1960s. A 1968 meteorological report concluded that the island was highly susceptible for strong winds, dominantly from the west, which could cause problems for air traffic. Three locations were considered: Kvalnes, Røssnesvågen og Nordlandet. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute concluded in 1973 that Nordlandet was the most suitable location in terms of weather, but test flights showed otherwise. Nordlandet was the cheapest alternative. Estimates showed that the regularity at an airport would be significantly lower than at the existing heliport. This caused local politicians to wish to keep the existing service, but pressure from Røst caused Værøy politicians to support an airport. After initial protests against Nordlandet as a site, Mayor Asmund Berg accepted the location on 3 May 1984. <b>There</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been conducted sufficient test flights to establish the wind conditions above the airport caused by Teisthammeren, a mountain next to the airport. Widerøe was opposed to the location of the airport.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} renewed in 2008 {{following}} {{the release of}} the first book in the Goosebumps HorrorLand series, Revenge of the Living Dummy, that was published on April 1, 2008. Before the 2008 release of Revenge of the Living Dummy, <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been a Goosebumps book published in almost 10 years. Stine decided to start writing Goosebumps books again after receiving mail asking him to write new books in the series. Nineteen Goosebumps HorrorLand books were published, and books in the series mainly featured two stories. The series continued in 2012 with new stories featuring some of the series' most memorable villains, including Slappy the Dummy, the Lawn Gnomes and others. The first book of the spin-off series Goosebumps Most Wanted, Planet of the Lawn Gnomes, was released in October 2012.|$|E

While not officially organized by Disney, the event, called My Royal Coronation, would feature the official Anna and Elsa characters owned by Disney with assistance from the company. On September 12, 2014, Walt Disney World announced that a Frozen attraction was scheduled to open in early 2016 at Epcot's World Showcase in the Norway pavilion, replacing the park's Maelstrom ride. The attraction features the kingdom of Arendelle with music and scenes from the film, as well as meet-and-greets with Anna and Elsa. Anna, Elsa, Kristoff, and Olaf will make appearances in Mickey’s Once Upon a Christmastime Parade, offered during Mickey’s Very Merry Christmas Party at Magic Kingdom in November and December 2014 (from November 7 to December 31). Also starting from November, every night Elsa will use her powers to transform Cinderella Castle into an ice palace.|$|E

5|$|The five-officer Omak Police Department detachment, which {{covered the}} {{municipality}} and nearby rural communities, reported over 180 criminal code offenses in 2010. The city's crime rate of 154 offenses per 100,000 people is 28 {{percent higher than}} the 2010 state average and one {{percent higher than the}} 2010 federal average. According to Uniform Crime Report statistics compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2011, there were 19 violent crimes and 166 property crimes. The violent crimes consisted of one forcible rape, three robberies and 15 aggravated assaults, while 32 burglaries, 104 larceny-thefts, eight motor vehicle thefts and one arson defined the property crimes. The FBI classifies Omak as having 4,921 people located within the Omak Police Department area. The city's highest crime rate was recorded in 2004, with 413 incidents per 100,000 people. Until 2013, when a murder and motor-vehicle theft occurred in the city, <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been a homicide for over ten consecutive years.
