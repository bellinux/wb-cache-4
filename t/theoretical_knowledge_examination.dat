40|$|Introduction: Emergency is an {{important}} department of any hospital, and education of medical students in this ward is of great importance. The students gain necessary skills for facing critical situations in this department. Therefore, educational conditions should be constantly monitored and improved {{in order to reach}} an efficient situation. The present study was aimed to survey the interns’ viewpoint on the condition of medical education in the emergency department (ED). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 100 interns of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences were questioned using a pre-designed checklist during the time between October 2013 and October 2014. The checklist consisted of demographic data and survey questions regarding the current condition, <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge,</b> practical skills, educational rank of ED compared to other hospital’s departments, and varying the duration of the educational course in ED. The data were analyzed using SPSS 21. Results: 100 interns were evaluated (55 % female), with an average age of 24. 7 ± 1. 5 years (minimum 23 and maximum 26). Most of the interns believed that training regarding clinical examination, diagnosis expression and treatment orders was enough for learning key points, while bedside education was inadequate. Most of the interns believed that gaining <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> on <b>examination</b> and diagnosis, was acceptable except regarding encountering patients with a decreased level of consciousness. Yet, they believed there were some deficiencies regarding <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> on treatment, except for treating allergies. Educational rank of ED compared to other departments was believed to be average. 60 % of the interns thought that the duration of medical education in ED should be increased, 4 % believed it should be decreased, and 36 % were satisfied with the current duration. Conclusion: Based on the results of this survey, the interns of two studied Hospitals were averagely satisfied with their educational condition in ED. Most interns believed that there was deficiency in the bedside education and <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge,</b> while they were relatively satisfied with the amount and quality of practical skills’ training...|$|R
40|$|The {{value and}} {{function}} of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> is an important and disputed issue, which has received surprisingly little scholarly attention. I attempt to clarify the notion of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> and examine its general relationship to learning. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> is not necessarily distinguished by any particular content; the adjective “theoretical” can just as well signify a particular methodological approach or a {{way of dealing with}} a topic, including the way it is conceptualized. I further argue that <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> can be merely implicit and non-propositional. Though I reject a radical constructivist view, according to which knowledge acquisition consists in socialization, it must be admitted that socialization and the acquisition of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> do turn out to go closely hand in hand, inasmuch as <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> is often a precondition of successful socialization. Concepts, principles, models and symbolic systems support the acquisition of both theoretical and other kinds of knowledge, but also help the learner to find her way about in an environment that is already formed by theories and conceptual understandings. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> is both a learning instrument and a tool for navigatio...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of the evidence to guide pain management practices, practices are often sub-optimal with children experiencing moderate to severe pain post-operatively. Limited <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> about managing pain has been suggested as one reason for this. Several studies have identified gaps in nurses' <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge.</b> However, the affect of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> on pain management practices has not been explored. This explored whether there is a relationship between nurses' <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> and the quality of their practices. Nurses (n= 13) on one children's surgical ward were shadowed for a five-hour period during two-four shifts. Data about post-operative pain management practices were collected using a pain management checklist and field notes. Nurses (n= 12) also completed the revised pain management knowledge test. Questionnaire scores were compared to the observational data. No positive relationship was found between nurses' level of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> and how well they actually managed pain. Nurses did not appear to routinely apply <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> in practice. This may explain, at least in part, why pain management practices remain poor despite the evidence to guide practice being readily available. The hypothesis, put forward in other studies, that increasing nurses' <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> about pain will improve practices may be overly simplistic...|$|R

40|$|Background/aim: Practice {{education}} is a compulsory component of all entry-level programmes in the health professions. It {{is used as a}} teaching strategy to connect <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge,</b> such as occupation-focussed models with practice. The study aimed to explore students' perceptions about the influence of practice educators on their understanding of the use of occupation-focussed models in practice. Methods: Using a phenomenological approach, semi-structured interviews gained an understanding of six participants' experiences of their practice education. Interview transcripts were analysed thematically. Findings: Three themes emerged from participants' experiences of practice education. 'Explaining the theory-practice nexus' referred to participants' difficulties in distinguishing between different forms of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge,</b> it described educators struggle to fulfil the dual roles of educator and practitioner' when articulating the <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> underpinning practice. This often led participants taking an active role in their own learning. 'Experiencing dissonance between university-based studies and the real-world' described the difference between the importance university studies placed on theory in comparison to practice. 'Creating a positive mindset for the use of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> in practice for future practice' illustrated strategies used by some practice educators to articulate the use of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Conclusions: The study highlighted practice educators role in shaping students' perceptions of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> use in professional reasoning. The increased recognition of practice educators on the implicit curricula creates an onus on the university sector to provide discussion and information exchanges to increase educators' opportunities to develop, update and increase their skills in describing and using <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> to underpin practice...|$|R

40|$|Objective : The European Paediatric Life Support (EPLS) {{provider}} course aims at training {{doctors and}} nurses in the efficient and prompt management of cardiopulmonary arrest in children. EPLS is a 2 -day European Resuscitation Council course, involving the teaching of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> and practical skills. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the retention of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> and certain skills of EPLS providers 4 months after the course. Materials and methods : In total, 80 {{doctors and nurses}} who attended three EPLS provider courses, from May 2012 to December 2012, were asked to participate in the study and only 50 responded positively. Demographic data (age, sex, occupation) of the participants were collected. The European Resuscitation Council-approved EPLS written test was used to assess <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> right after the course and after 4 months. The retention of certain skills (airway opening, bag-mask ventilation, chest compressions) was also examined. Results : The <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> decreased significantly (P < 0. 001) 4 months after the course. Age, sex and occupational status (medical or nursing profession) had no effect in <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> retention. Interestingly, certain skills such as the application of airway opening manoeuvres and effective bag-mask ventilation were retained 4 months after the course, whereas chest compression skill retention significantly declined (P= 0. 012). Conclusion : According to our findings, <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the EPLS course uniformly declines, irrespective of the provider characteristics, whereas retention of certain skills is evident 4 months after the course...|$|R
