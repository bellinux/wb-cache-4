We address limitations of Fourier-based methods such as screen periodicity and low spatial frequency power content. Comparisons of adaptive optics (AO) simulator performance when fed AR phase screens and <b>translating</b> <b>phase</b> screens reveal significantly elevated residual closed-loop temporal power for small increases in added stochastic content at each time step, thus displaying the importance of properly modeling atmospheric "boiling".

40|$|The {{performance}} of a closed loop adaptive optics system may in principle be improved by selecting distinct and independently optimized control bandwidths for separate components, or modes, of the wave front distortion profile. In this paper we outline a method for synthesizing and optimizing a multi-bandwidth adaptive optics control system from performance estimates previously derived for single-bandwidth control systems operating over a range of bandwidths. Numerical results are presented for {{the case of an}} atmospheric turbulence profile consisting of a single <b>translating</b> <b>phase</b> screen with Kolmogorov statistics, a Shack-Hartmann wave front sensor with 8 subapertures across the aperture of the telescope, and a continuous facesheet deformable mirror with actuators conjugate to the corners of the wave front sensor subapertures. The use of multiple control bandwidths significantly relaxes the wave front sensor noise level allowed for the adaptive optics system to operate near the performance limit imposed by fitting error. Nearly all of this reduction is already achieved {{through the use of a}} control system utilizing only two distinct bandwidths, one of which is the zero bandwidth. ...|$|E

ARA's can be easily modified to function as receiving, as well as transmitting, arrays. Due to their inherent failsafe characteristics, ARA's are particularly attractive for microwave power transmission from solar power satellites. Communication satellites and deep space probes are other possible applications.

40|$|Abstract — A {{differential}} interference contrast (DIC) micro-scope is {{an effective}} non-invasive interferometer for visualizing live, transparent biological cells, transforming phase variations to intensity contrast images. In fertility clinics the DIC microscope is used for morphological evaluation of human embryo thick cells in order to choose the best embryos to transfer back to the uterus. This evaluation is qualitative and expert dependent. Quantifying the embryos ’ shape will improve the selection of embryos {{and the chance to}} obtain pregnancy and birth. A reconstruction of the visualized object shape out of 2 D DIC images is thus needed, preceded by understanding the DIC image formation. The Born approximation is often used within the image formation model, as it simplifies the object shape reconstruction in both DIC and light microscopes. However, this approximation is limited to modeling thin objects lying in the range of the validity region. A different approach to modeling is based on the Lorentz-Mie scattering theory (Mie series solution) which has no such limitations. Yet, the image reconstruction using the Mie solution is non-trivial. In this work the Born approximation is compared to the Mie solution for an error analysis. In particular, since the DIC technique is based on <b>translating</b> <b>phase</b> shift into contrast images, we study the Born approximation in terms of phase and amplitude separately. It is well known that asymptotic approximations might be useful outside their strictly defined validity region. Therefore a potential expansion of the Born approximation validity region is sought to make it suitable for various problems of practical interest. I...|$|E

Placental growth factor was evaluated at baseline and study week 4 (after 3 weeks treatment) in an exploratory analysis of data from a randomized phase 2 study of motesanib 125 mg once daily plus carboplatin/paclitaxel and in a prespecified analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind phase 3 study of motesanib 125 mg once daily plus carboplatin/paclitaxel vs placebo plus carboplatin/paclitaxel (MONET 1). Associations between fold-change from baseline in placental growth factor and overall survival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. In the phase 2 study, serum placental growth factor increased from baseline a mean 2. 8 -fold at study week 4. Patients with ≥ 2. 2 -fold change from baseline in placental growth factor (n =  18) had significantly longer overall survival than those with < 2. 2 -fold change (n =  19; 22. 9 vs 7. 9 months; hazard ratio, 0. 30; 95 % CI, 0. 12 - 0. 74; P =  0. 009). Consequently, placental growth factor was investigated as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in the phase 3 MONET 1 study. There was no association between log-transformed placental growth factor fold-change from baseline to week 4 (continuous variable) and overall survival (hazard ratio, 0. 98; 95 % CI, 0. 79 - 1. 22; P =  0. 868). MONET 1 did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival. Likewise, median overall survival was similar among patients with ≥ 2. 0 -fold change in placental growth factor (n =  229) compared with < 2. 0 -fold change (n =  127; 14. 8 vs 13. 8 months; hazard ratio, 0. 88; 95 % CI, 0. 67 - 1. 15, P =  0. 340).

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the meaning and}} role of creative writing in teaching literature in elementary school. The first theoretical part discusses contemporary cognitive theory in which writing itself is a process {{as important as the}} text. Since the traditional conception of writing was centered on the result of the writing process – the text. The cognitive writing model is composed of three parts: 1. task environment; 2. the writers’ long term memory and 3. writing process. In addition two writing models are discussed: the simpler knowledge telling and the more complex knowledge-transforming model. Knowledge of writing strategies for improving the writing process {{is a part of the}} writing model. The first part of the thesis is based on the theory of divergent thinking which encompasses the definition of creativity, characteristics of divergent thinking and creative individuals and methods of stimulating creativity. The second part of the thesis presents a historical overview of theories of written compositions in school commencing from the year 1850 to the present time, including four important turning points (I) originators of composition writing Majar (1850) and in continuation Praprotnik. (II) The second period marked by Bezjak and Lichtenwallner (1908) strive to promote, a new, no longer the old teaching of writing. Originating from this period are also textbooks by Bezjak and Schreiner, reading – books by Bajec, Rupel, Sovre and Kolarič. (III) The third period is represented by Šilih (1955), who tries to re-evaluate teaching, new, no longer the old manner of teaching composition writing. This period is carried into the 1950 's by Trdina (1955 – 1964) and Silvester (1959 – 1960) and is followed by a time in which writing is schools emphasizes on the text – product of writing and linguistic correctness of written compositions. (IV) The 1980 's and 1990 's mark the beginning of creative workshops simulated not only by the influence of American schools but also by the development of the educational system, mother – tongue didactics and literature, a greater democratization of teaching and a new conception of the child. This has lead to a division between poetry prose workshops on one hand and creative writing in school on the other. The end of the twentieth century marks the emergence of contemporary theories of writing. In the third part of the thesis the author proposes a model of teaching writing based on Slovene tradition and practice of written compositions and at the same time supplements the proposition of the curriculum of the Slovene language for the nine year elementary school. The proposed model is congruent with the above mentioned curriculum and is at the same time it's supplement. School writing is conceptualized as a didactic process that must take into account the task environment, the writer’s long – term memory and the writing process.

The model is a cognitive writing model that seeks to develop writing skills with text creation methods through the simple knowledge telling strategy up to the more advanced knowledge transforming strategy.

These titles are thematically and structurally analyzed in the second part of the thesis and like the work itself indicate further research possibilities...|$|E

The findings of that study and test, along with other studies, have resulted in a new strategy for achieving the Commercial Supersonic Technologys goals for noise and performance.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the process of}} synchronous collaborative L 2 writing using Google Docs in an English for medical purposes setting at university level. The research design is qualitative in nature as the collaborative practices of 24 German medical students in eight groups of three were investigated. The study focussed on the (approximately) 45 - 50 minutes long collaborative writing process of the eight groups {{with respect to their}} negotiation of the collaborative process. In other words, how did the students use Google Docs synchronously in terms of channel usage? What aspects of the collaborative task did those groups of L 2 students decide to make a subject of discussion and what does that tell us {{about the nature of the}} process? Finally, how did students experience this synchronous collaborative writing process? The data collection relied primarily on the built-in recording features of Google Docs. The resulting data (chat logs, revision history of the co-authored texts, comments history) was compiled into a chronologically organised data set. In addition, participants took part in a post-activity survey. The participants’ collaborative practices and their answers in the survey were analysed utilising a qualitative content analysis approach. 	The results of the analysis revealed three major findings: First, students participated very actively in the activity, resulting in many opportunities for creating and negotiating language output – a necessary condition for second language development. Students focussed primarily on content- and workflow-related discussions, which is in line with findings from collaborative writing research. Students also engaged in ‘languaging’, i. e. language-related metatalk, which raises their language awareness – another facilitator of second language development. Due to the computer-mediated nature of the student discourse and the students’ high language level, surface-level matters like layout or spelling were not discussed by the students. Second, the analysis of discussion episodes revealed that the participants verbalised certain aspects of the writing process in their task-related meta discussions. An initial peak in workflow- and content-related discussions resembled a planning phase, the following rise in language- and structure-related discussions represented the <b>translating</b> <b>phase.</b> The final phase, which resembled a revision phase, saw a decrease of all discussions. Third, it had been hoped that two distinct patterns of solving a task together, namely collaboration and cooperation, could be identified by investigating instances of synchronous channel usage. However, synchronous activity in the text or overlap of activity in the chat and text did not prove to be a reliable indicator of either pattern. Due to the synchronous and all-written nature of the activity, it seemed plausible to classify synchronous collaborative writing as collaboration by default. The analysis also revealed a negative correlation between chat activity and performance in the final text. Groups who performed worst in the final texts dedicated substantially more time to chatting (about content- and workflow-related matters) than more successful groups. These groups seemed to struggle to establish a common content and workflow understanding, which is further supported by the post-activity survey. An all-written, multi-modal environment proved to be a challenge for some students, who could have benefitted from pedagogical guidance. 	The exploratory investigation of the synchronous collaborative L 2 writing process with Google Docs led to several implications for foreign language teaching and research. First, the implementation of web-based technology can pose a serious legal and ethical challenge for educators and researchers in Germany, in particular, as user data is surrendered to global cloud-based systems – a problem which can only be solved by relying on locally installed, open source software. Second, shared documents can be a powerful tool to bridge the gap between classroom activities and the online component in blended learning settings. Third, shared documents make learning processes visible and, hence, assessable – albeit a shift from a product-oriented to a process-oriented assessment approach poses several pedagogical and pragmatic challenges. Fourth, shared documents is a feasible way for educators to collect user data for research but could benefit from the inclusion of more sophisticated means of data collection, such as eye-tracking or screen recording. Finally, the exploratory setup of this study revealed that a new way of working together requires guidelines on how to best exploit the possibilities of shared documents technology to work collaboratively on a joint project – a valuable avenue for future research...|$|E

40|$|For the {{computer}} Zebra we have undertaken {{a project of}} con-structing an Algol translator {{with the aim of}} being as complete as possible (with the only exception of own variable arrays). As a few new concepts are used in this design, it is thought to be useful to communicate them in this form. Zebra is a two address machine with a very limited fast store and a reasonable drum store of 8192 words. The operation code is a rather peculiar one. Every bit of the 15 bits of the function part of an instruction is used separately for a different elemen-tary function. The operations are in fact micro-operations and more complicated actions such as multiplication, division, list searching, etc. are not built in functions but can be readily pro-grammed. This makes the code extremely powerful for just those operations which are required for an Algol translator. On the other hand it is not the appropriate object language for Algol. Therefore we decided to create a new object language within the machine which is used interpretatively. The structure of this object language (called Intermediate Code or IC) is fully adapted to the requirements of Algol. The analytic code of Zebra helps a great deal in making the interpreter fast and c 0. npact. Another reason why an interpretive code is not such a drawback is that the machine has no built-in floating point operations so that these have to be programmed anyway. The system as a whole works on a load-and-go basis. First the translator is put into the machine, into {{the upper end of the}} store and the Algol program is then fed in, translated and built up in the lower part of the store. Then the interpreter over-writes the translator and the program can start working. We shall distinguish these phases by the names <b>translate</b> <b>phase</b> ~nd run phase...|$|R

The latter is a new path algorithm based on Fisher information theory, which combines the phase derivative with the expected variance to get a more robust path, potentially performing better than others {{in the case of}} low image quality. In order to compare only the performance of the paths, the same unwrapping function (phase derivative integral) is used.

In Piano Phase the performers repeat a rapid twelve-note melodic figure, initially in unison.

This cycle of speeding up and then locking in continues throughout the piece; the cycle comes full circle three times, {{the second and third}} cycles using shorter versions of the initial figure. Violin Phase, also written in 1967, is built on these same lines. Piano Phase and Violin Phase both premiered in a series of concerts given in New York art galleries.|$|R

40|$|Transferring {{data from}} one {{geographic}} information system (GIS) to another is difficult because of the diverse, and often complex, structure of transfer file formats. Accordingly, the design and implementation of an interface for transferring data from one format to another is time consuming and difficult. The translation may be performed by an interface constructed for the two formats (the individual interfacing strategy), by two interfaces through an interchange format (the interchange format interfacing strategy), or {{by a number of}} interfaces through a series of formats (the ring interfacing strategy). The interchange format interfacing strategy is widely adopted because it offers an acceptable compromise between the quality of the data translation and number of interfaces required. In contrast, the individual interfacing strategy achieves the best quality of translation but is generally rejected because of the impracticality of constructing a large number of interfaces. The goal pursued in this thesis is to maximise the quality of the translation by overcoming the impracticality of the individual interfacing strategy. This is achieved in the following way. An interface is divided into three phases: the decode phase, in which the source format decoder places data from the source format into a relational data base; the <b>translate</b> <b>phase,</b> in which the data is restructured according to a translation algorithm written in a relational query language; and the encode phase, in which the target format encoder places data from the relational data base into the target format. The time and effort involved in implementing these phases of data translation is minimised {{with the assistance of the}} following software tools: parser generators and lexical analysers which are used for generating format decoders; a relational data base management system which is used for implementing translation algorithms; and an encoder generator which is used for generating format encoders. The encoder generator is a new tool developed in this thesis. The efficacy of these tools is demonstrated, and a significant reduction in the effort of constructing interfaces is achieved, making the individual interfacing strategy a practical approach...|$|R

Since the signal travels from the SAR antenna to the target and back again, the measured displacement is twice the unit of wavelength.

40|$|We {{construct}} a holographic model for Josephson junctions with a defect system of a Dp brane intersecting a D(p+ 2) brane. In {{addition to providing}} a geometrical picture for the holographic dual, this leads us very naturally to suggest the possibility of non-Abelian Josephson junctions characterized {{in terms of the}} topological properties of the branes. The difference between the locations of the endpoints of the Dp brane {{on either side of the}} defect <b>translates</b> into the <b>phase</b> difference of the condensate in the Josephson junction. We also add a magnetic flux on the D(p+ 2) brane and allow it evolve adiabatically along a closed curve in the space of the magnetic flux, while generating a non-trivial Berry holonomy.

40|$|The {{availability}} of accurate trajectory information is paramount for the processing and exploitation of {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) data. Considering the particular case of spaceborne SARs designed for repeat-pass interferometric applications, errors in the trajectory <b>translate</b> into <b>phase</b> artifacts that affect the interferometric performance. In this paper, we propose a model-based procedure to calibrate the trajectories of spaceborne SAR systems by the multisquint (MS) phase. The technique allows to estimate the along and the derivative of across track geometric errors. The geometric model of the InSAR phase is derived {{as a function of}} positioning errors and the MS phase model as derivative of the InSAR phase geometric model, with respect to the squint angle. We perform a sensitivity analysis of the model in order to define which geometric errors can be estimated by the MS phase, justifying the assumption that the MS phase is very poorly affected by the atmospheric phase screen. We particularly concentrate on the TOPSAR acquisition mode, where the phase is very sensitive to geometric errors. We start from the classical two-image case and then consider the extension to the multibaseline case. Experimental results obtained by processing of interferometric pairs acquired by the Sentinel- 1 A sensor are reported...|$|R
40|$|We are {{planning}} experiments using a Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) plasma injected into a metal cylinder, which is subsequently electrically imploded {{to achieve a}} fusing plasma. Diagnosing this plasma is quite challenging due to the short timescales, high energy densities, high magnetic fields, and difficult access. We outline our diagnostic sets in both a Phase I study (where the plasma will be formed and <b>translated),</b> and <b>Phase</b> II study (where the plasma will be imploded). The pre-compression plasma (diameter of only 8 - 10 cm, length of 30 - 40 cm) {{is expected to have}} n~ 1017 cm- 3, T ~ 100 - 300 eV, B~ 5 T, and a lifetime of 10 - 20 microseconds. We will use visible laser interferometry across the plasma, along with a series of fiber-optically coupled visible light monitors to determine the plasma density and position. Excluded flux loops will be placed outside the quartz tube of the formation region, but inside of the diameter of the theta-pinch formation coils. Impurity emission in the visible and XUV range will be monitored spectroscopically, and fast bolometers will measure the total radiated power. A 20 -Joule Thomson scattering laser beam will be introduced in the axial direction, and scattered light (from multiple spatial points) will be collected from the sides. Neutron diagnostics (activation and time-resolved scintillation detectors) will be fielded during both phases of the DD experiments...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} {{based on an}} optical delay line {{structure}} is proposed for two-dimensional optical beam steering. For one-dimensional beam steering, the laser beam to be deflected is split into N co-directional sub-beams of equal intensity {{with the aid of}} a plane-parallel plate. These sub-beams experience a relative time delay, which <b>translates</b> into a <b>phase</b> difference, thus forming a phased array. When the laser wavelength is tuned, the relative phase varies and the far-field interference footprint can be steered across a receive plane. By employing two plane-parallel plates in series, the described scheme can be extended to produce a twodimensional N × N, array of sub-beams, allowing two-dimensional beam steering via wavelength tuning. In this paper, preliminary experimental results with four sub-beams are presented. Nomenclature a = aperture spacing of two consecutive beams αx = deflection sensitivity coefficients for the x direction α...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} measure the {{electron}} cloud density, a microwave transmission measurement was set up over 30 m in the SPS beam pipe. The use of TE waveguide modes eliminates direct interaction with the highly relativistic beam. An electron cloud present in the beam pipe should lead to a small phase shift of the CW microwave signal. Since this phase shift is modulated by the bunch revolution frequency, it <b>translates</b> to a <b>phase</b> modulation which can be measured. However, defying all expectations, a huge beam-induced signal attenuation was found which cannot be understood by current electron cloud models. This attenuation showed erratic memory effects {{in the order of}} microseconds after the passage of a batch or single bunch. Both effects are present {{for a wide range of}} microwave signal frequencies and beam parameters. Models to possibly explain this effect are discussed. bea...|$|R
