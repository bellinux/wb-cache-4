500|$|The film also {{influenced}} American film productions: John Carpenter {{has suggested that}} the film inspired the idea of a featureless mask for the Michael Myers character in the slasher film series Halloween.

500|$|The {{concept of}} a black Spider-Man was first {{discussed}} {{a few months before}} the November 2008 election of Barack Obama as President of the United States. Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Axel Alonso describes the catalyst, [...] "When we were planning [...] "Ultimatum," [...] we realized that we were standing at the brink of America electing its first African-American President and we acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> was time to {{take a good look at}} one of our icons." [...] This new Spider-Man would replace Parker as Spider-Man only in Ultimate Marvel, an imprint whose storyline is set in a universe separate from the mainstream Marvel universe, in which Marvel's characters were reimagined for a 21st century audience. The replacement of Ultimate Peter Parker was considered as a possible part of the 2008–09 [...] "Ultimatum" [...] story arc that restructured much of the Ultimate Marvel universe, but those early thoughts were abandoned because the story for that character had not yet been developed. When Marvel's editorial staff decided that the Ultimate universe's Peter Parker would be killed in the 2011 storyline [...] "", the character Miles Morales was created. Although Morales is the first black Spider-Man, he marks the second time a Latino character has taken the Spider-Man identity. Miguel O'Hara, who is of half Mexican descent, was the title character in the 1990s series Spider-Man 2099.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2001, Fallon Bowman left Kittie. Bowman {{explained}} why {{she left the}} band, saying: [...] "I was unhappy with some things in the band so I felt <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> {{was time for me}} to depart. I think it was for the best". On October 30, 2001, Kittie released their second album Oracle. Sounding more aggressive than [...] "Spit", the album features elements of death metal and thrash metal. Morgan Lander noted how the band members were only 14 years old when writing their debut album and said [...] "We haven't written in 4 or 5 years." [...] She acknowledged a change in influence from their early days, stating, [...] "Then we listened to bands like Nirvana, Silverchair, and Alice in Chains. Now we listen to stuff like Cannibal Corpse and Nile." [...] However, the band would continue to write in the same fashion by first composing the music and then using that [...] "as the backdrop behind the vocals." [...] The album Oracle was recorded with Morgan Lander as the sole guitarist. Fallon's position as guitarist was filled by Jeff Phillips who worked as Kittie's guitar technician. In 2002, Talena Atfield left the band and was replaced on bass by Jennifer Arroyo. In 2004, the group added guitarist Lisa Marx, and Jeff Phillips went to work full-time on his side project, Thine Eyes Bleed. On July 27, 2004, Kittie released their third studio album Until the End.|$|E

60|$|In the morning, when I awoke I {{had been}} dreaming, {{and the dream}} was so vivid, so like reality, that it deceived me, and I thought it was real. In the dream I had seen Henry a corpse. He lay in a {{metallic}} burial-case. He {{was dressed in a}} suit of my clothing, and on his breast lay a great bouquet of flowers, mainly white roses, with a red rose in the centre. The casket stood upon a couple of chairs. I dressed, and moved toward that door, thinking I would go in there and look at it, but I changed my mind. I thought I could not yet bear to meet my mother. I thought I would wait awhile and make some preparation for that ordeal. The house was in Locust Street, a little above 13th, and I walked to 14th, and {{to the middle of the}} block beyond, before it suddenly flashed upon me that there was nothing real about this--it was only a dream. I can still feel something of the grateful upheaval of joy of that moment, and I can also still feel the remnant of doubt, the suspicion <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> was real, after all. I returned to the house almost on a run, flew up the stairs two or three steps at a jump, and rushed into that sitting-room--and was made glad again, for there was no casket there.|$|E
5000|$|Role of Westerners in post-colonial AfricaAlthough {{there is}} a clear {{accusation}} of Western influence on Biafran war (mostly England’s involvement in the war), a more subtle critique is found in Richard’s character. Richard, although with good intentions, tries too hard to be part of first Nigeria, and later Biafra. His fascination with the culture and his wish to be part of Biafra leads to him speaking for Biafrans by attempting to write two novels, one about the art, and the second one about the Biafran war. Richard is unable to complete either, and concludes that these are not his stories to tell. However, he is effective when he writes about the war for the Western press, which actually helps Biafra’s cause. Adichie herself has said in an interview, that “maybe character is my subtle way of slipping in my politics <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it’s</b> time <b>that</b> Africans wrote about Africa.” ...|$|R

60|$|Through {{weakness}} and sickness and faintness, Otto had lain {{in a half}} swoon through all that long journey under the hot May sun. It was as in a dreadful nightmare {{that he had heard}} {{on and on and on}} that monotonous throbbing of galloping hoofs upon the ground; had felt that last kiss that his father had given him upon his cheek. Then the onward ride again, until all faded away into a dull mist and he knew no more. When next he woke it was with the pungent smell of burned vinegar in his nostrils and with the feeling of a cool napkin bathing his brow. He opened his eyes and then closed them again, thinking he must have been in a dream, for he lay in his old room at the peaceful monastery of the White Cross on the hill; the good Father Abbot sat near by, gazing upon his face with the old absent student look, Brother John sat in the deep window seat also gazing at him, and Brother Theodore, the leech of the monastery, sat beside him bathing his head. Beside these old familiar faces were the faces of those who had been with him in that long flight; the One-eyed Hans, old Master Nicholas his kinsman, and the others. So he closed his eyes, thinking <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> was all a dream. But the sharp throbbing of the poor stump at his wrist soon taught him that he was still awake.|$|E
