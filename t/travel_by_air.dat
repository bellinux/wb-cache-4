5|$|Johnson {{found himself}} in a {{difficult}} situation during the Indian leg of the tour. The team—mostly made up of RAAF personnel—had been ill with food poisoning and dysentery, and travelled across the Indian subcontinent by long train journeys. The airmen wanted to <b>travel</b> <b>by</b> <b>air,</b> and threatened to abandon the tour or replace Hassett, an AIF member, with either Keith Carmody or Keith Miller, who were RAAF fighter pilots. However, the standoff was ended when Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane to transport the team. On the playing arena, it was not a happy tour for Johnson and his men. They lost the three-match series against India 1–0 and recorded only one victory, against South Zone, in their nine matches.|$|E
5|$|Miller, the vice-captain, almost {{missed the}} trip to India after turning up late for the voyage. On arrival in India, Miller scored 46 in a draw against North Zone. Miller then captained the Australians in a match against West Zone in Bombay, top-scoring with 106 in a high-scoring draw. In a match against India, Miller took two wickets. At this point, {{with most of the}} team {{suffering}} from dysentery and the leadership not permitting the team to <b>travel</b> <b>by</b> <b>air,</b> some of the RAAF personnel felt that Hassett should be removed from the captaincy, with Miller as one of the candidates to replace him. This would have increased his prospects of leading Australia. Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when a RAAF plane was acquired to transport the team.|$|E
5|$|Hassett enjoyed greater {{success on}} the Services tour of India, {{although}} the Australians had little to celebrate as a team. It was a tougher proposition for Hassett’s men, as {{all but one of}} the nine matches were against first-class opposition, and many of the players regarded the local umpires as being deliberately biased in favour of the home teams. After arriving in October, conflict hit the team after a series of ineffective displays. The team, mostly made up of RAAF personnel, had been ill with food poisoning and dysentery, and travelled across the Indian subcontinent via long and bumpy train journeys for the first month. The airmen wanted to <b>travel</b> <b>by</b> <b>air,</b> and tried to ask Hassett and manager Keith Johnson for air travel. When this was refused, they threatened to abandon the tour or replace infantryman Hassett with either Keith Carmody or Keith Miller—who were RAAF fighter pilots—if their wish was not granted. With incumbent Australian captain Bradman likely to miss the upcoming tour of New Zealand, the Services leader would be one of the frontrunners for the national captaincy. Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane already in India to transport the team; after a month in India, their first flight came in late November.|$|E

25|$|The {{accident}} was particularly alarming in that {{public confidence in}} air travel had increased during the 1950s {{with the introduction of}} new airliners like the Super Constellation, Douglas DC-7, and Boeing Stratocruiser. <b>Travel</b> <b>by</b> <b>air</b> had become routine for large corporations, and vacationers often considered flying instead of traveling by train. At the time, a congressional committee was reviewing domestic air travel, as there was growing concern over the number of accidents. However, little progress was being made and the state of ATC {{at the time of the}} Grand Canyon accident reflected the methods of the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Biologist Arturo Massol and radiochemist Elba Díaz {{conducted}} an unpublished study in January 2001 that showed vegetables and plants {{growing in the}} civilian area of Vieques were highly contaminated with heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and copper. Furthermore, they discovered that metal concentrations in edible crops were both substantially above the maximum levels set by the European Union Council and much higher than plants tested in mainland Puerto Rico. Chiles, pasture grasses, and squashes were more effected than plants with deeper root systems such as trees. This {{is consistent with the}} theory that heavy metals <b>travel</b> <b>by</b> <b>air</b> to civilian areas via the steady easterly trade winds that blow directly from the bombing zone.|$|E
25|$|Conflict hit {{the team}} after the {{ineffective}} display against the students. The team, mostly {{made up of}} RAAF personnel, had been ill with food poisoning and dysentery, and travelled across the Indian subcontinent via long train journeys. The airmen wanted to <b>travel</b> <b>by</b> <b>air,</b> and tried to ask Hassett and manager Keith Johnson for air travel. When this was refused, they threatened to abandon the tour or replace Lindsay Hassett, an Australian Imperial Force member, with either Keith Carmody or Keith Miller, who were RAAF fighter pilots if their wish was not granted. With Bradman likely to miss the upcoming tour of New Zealand, the Services captain {{would be one of}} the leading candidates to lead Australia. Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when Squadron Leader Stan Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane already in India to transport the team. On the first flight to Calcutta, the squad survived an electrical storm that caused the plane to drop altitude.|$|E

50|$|Like elsewhere, {{railways}} in India {{compete with}} air travel and road transport. The advantages of <b>travelling</b> <b>by</b> <b>air</b> between cities are the greater frequency of flights, and shorter travel time. Rail travel, {{with few exceptions}} (if any), offers lower cost.|$|R

25|$|Matthew's {{strong winds}} knocked {{power lines and}} cell towers, which limited {{communications}} {{in the days following}} the storm, and left about 80% of the Tiburon Peninsula without power. A damaged antenna cut communications with Sud, and there were interruptions to the Digicel mobile phone network. Excessive flooding along 13watersheds, as well as the heavy forestry damage, killed many forest and fruit species. The flooding produced mudslides that washed out roads and bridges. Along Route Nationale #2, the hurricane washed away the Petit-Goâve Bridge, which is the only bridge linking the nation's capital Port-au-Prince with southwestern Haiti. This meant that relief workers and supplies temporarily had to <b>travel</b> <b>by</b> <b>air</b> to reach the most affected areas. A temporary bridge to transport humanitarian relief was constructed by October6. Across southern Haiti, the hurricane damaged 70% of the polling locations for the Haitian presidential election scheduled for October9; {{as a result of the}} storm, the election was postponed to an undetermined date on October5. Nationwide, Matthew damaged over 400schools, while 150other schools functioned as shelters for around 16,000evacuees. Damage to schools affected about 130,000children, many of whom had just started their school year, and were in need of a new location for their education. Of the nation's 15main hospitals, one was destroyed and another four were damaged, with 35medical clinics damaged, many of these were understaffed and unable to cope with the number of incoming patients.|$|E
