Prokaryote production was high in the Pacific-origin water masses located in the upper-mesopelagic layer (100 - 200 m).

40|$|A major mode of gene {{expression}} evolution {{is based on}} changes in cis-regulatory elements (CREs) whose function critically depends {{on the presence of}} transcription factor–binding sites (TFBS). Because CREs experience extensive TFBS turnover even with conserved function, alignment-based studies of CRE sequence evolution are limited to very closely related species. Here, we propose an alternative approach based on a stochastic model of TFBS turnover. We implemented a maximum likelihood model that permits variable turnover rates {{in different parts of the}} species tree. This model can be used to detect changes in turnover rate as a proxy for differences in the selective pressures acting on TFBS in different clades. We applied this method to five TFBS in the fungi methionine biosynthesis pathway and three TFBS in the HoxA clusters of vertebrates. We find that <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>turnover</b> rate is generally high, with half-life ranging between ∼ 5 and 150 My and a mode around tens of millions of years.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In this paper, {{we examine}} 3 {{different}} models used to <b>estimate</b> <b>turnover</b> of soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions using radiocarbon measurements: one conventional carbon dating model and two bomb 14 C models. One {{of the bomb}} 14 C models uses an atmospheric 14 C record for the period 22, 050 BC to AD 2003 and is solved by numerical methods, while the other assumes a constant 14 C content of the atmosphere and is solved analytically. <b>The</b> <b>estimates</b> of SOC <b>turnover</b> obtained by the conventional 14 C dating model differed substantially from those obtained by the bomb 14 C models, which we attribute to the simplifying assumption of the conventional 14 C model that the whole SOC fraction is of the same age. The assumptions underlying the bomb 14 C models are more applicable to SOC fractions; therefore, the calculated turnover times {{are considered to be}} more reliable. We used Monte Carlo simulations to <b>estimate</b> <b>the</b> uncertainties of the turnover times calculated with the numerically solved 14 C model, accounting not only for measurement errors but also for uncertainties introduced from assumptions of constant input and uncertainties in the 14 C content of the CO 2 assimilated by plants. The resulting uncertainties depend on systematic deviations in the atmospheric 14 C record for SOC fractions with a fast turnover. Therefore, the use of the bomb 14 C models can be problematic when SOC fractions with a fast turnover are analyzed, whereas the relative uncertainty of <b>the</b> <b>turnover</b> <b>estimates</b> turned out to be smaller than 30 % when the turnover time of the SOC fractions analyzed was longer than 30 yr, and smaller than 15 % when the turnover time was longer than 100 yr...|$|R

Fukui, K. Kato, Kodama, H. Ohta, T. Shima moto, and T. Shimono, Proc. Jpn. Acad. 64 B: 13 - 16, 1988). Kinetic measurements were made of the cellular responses of S. mutans FA- 1 to ethanol in comparison with those to glucose. In contrast to oxygen-independent acid production from glucose, oxygen was absolutely required for acid production from ethanol. Ethanol elicited a marked increase in the intracellular ATP concentration (ATPi) from a starved level to a steady level which was held constant as long as oxygen was present in the medium. Once oxygen was exhausted, ATPi returned to the starved level without delay. On the contrary, ATPi changes induced by glucose, which were independent of oxygen, followed a rather complicated time course before a steady level was established. Both the steady ATPi and the rate of accompanying oxygen consumption were functions of the ethanol concentration. These two parameters were linearly correlated, indicating that the unimolecular ATP turnover rate, which is independent of the rate of ATP generation in the steady state, can be calculated for cells energized by ethanol. <b>The</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>turnover</b> rate was 1. 5 s- 1 at 37 degrees C, which is comparable to that for other bacteria energized by glucose under nongrowing conditions...|$|E

Root-removal protocols that vary between investigators thus can potentially confound variability in carbon cycling for this fraction caused by environmental factors, such as climate.

Sequentially isolated density fractions clearly differed in mineralogy and organic matter chemistry, but natural-abundance 14 C analyses indicated that distinct mineral phases did not correspond to unique C-turnover pools. Density fractions containing kaolinite group minerals alone and in combination with hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite were found to harbor both fast and slow cycling carbon. In contrast, severe chemical treatment isolated a carbon pool with the lowest overall 14 C content and longest inferred mean turnover time.

METHODOLOGY: Temporal changes in human subadult bone collagen turnover rates were estimated from data on tissue-level bone metabolism reported in previous studies. A model for reconstructing precise weaning ages was then developed using a framework of approximate Bayesian computation and incorporating <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>turnover</b> rates. The model is presented as a new open source R package, WARN (Weaning Age Reconstruction with Nitrogen isotope analysis), which computes the age at the start and end of weaning, (15) N-enrichment through maternal to infant tissue, and [Formula: see text] value of collagen synthesized entirely from weaning foods with their posterior probabilities. The model was applied to 39 previously reported Holocene skeletal populations from around the world, and the results were compared with weaning ages observed in ethnographic studies. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in the age at the end of weaning between the archaeological (2. 80 ± 1. 32 years) and ethnographic populations. By comparing archaeological populations, it appears that weaning ages did not differ with the type of subsistence practiced (i. e., hunting-gathering or not). Most of [Formula: see text]-enrichment (2. 44 ± 0. 90 ‰) was consistent with biologically valid values. The nitrogen isotope ratios of subadults after the weaning process were lower than those of adults in most of the archaeological populations (- 0. 48 ± 0. 61 ‰), and this depletion was greater in non-hunter-gatherer populations.

Oxygenic photosynthesis was selectively inhibited by adding [3 -(3, 4 -dichloro) - 1, 1 -dimethyl-urea] (DCMU). Benthic fluxes were determined experimentally from {{the change in}} manganese and iron concentrations in the overlying water, and were predicted from the pore water concentration gradients at the sediment-water interface assuming molecular diffusion as the transport mechanism.

Areas within bio-based chemicals, biomaterials, biofules and bioenergy, biorefineries, resource-efficiency and industrial symbiosis and services based on ecosystem services havehigh innovation and growth potential of bioeconomy. The obstacles of innovation in Nordic bioeconomy are lack of capital and funding, unstable operating environment due to changing regulation, market access and lack of number of actors involved in the ecosystems. Areas for further development to better tackle the identified obstacles include networking and developing a common understanding of the roles of different stakeholders, making processes for seeking support and financing easier for SMEs and promoting cross-sector transfer of existing or new applications for existing processes. Venture capitalists {{should be included in the}} networks to ensure they are better able to recognize the potential of commercial viable bioeconomy concepts. More focus may also be needed to link the support to finding commercially viable applications with the markets and customers...|$|R

The in-fluence of bilateral adrenalectomy on {{the synthesis of}} norepinephrine (NE) in the rat heart was determined by three independent methods 6 to 9 days after the operation. Two of <b>the</b> methods involved <b>estimating</b> <b>turnover</b> rates by: 1) measuring the decline of cardiac NE after inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase with a-methyl-p-tyrosine (cz-MPT) and 2) measur-ing the decline in specific activity of H’-NE in the heart after its i. v. administration. The third method involved measuring the amount of C 14 -NE formed in the heart after the i. v. administration of C 14 -tyrosine. Results obtained from all three methods showed {{a significant increase in}} the synthesis rate of NE in hearts from adrenalectomized rats over that obtained in normal or sham-operated animals. Hydrocortisone, desoxycorticosterone acetate and hex-amethonium all prevented the accelerated synthesis rate. Adrenalectomy did not alter the uptake of H 8 -NE in the isolated perfused heart but did result in a significant increase in myocardial monoamine oxidase activity. it is suggested that the increase in synthesis rat...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} by legumes has {{a particular}} requirement for adequate soil sulphur status. Sulphur (S) is a mobile nutrient and is easily leached from aquic soil environments, therefore regular topdressing with S fertilizer is required to maintain legume vigor and pasture production in most New Zealand pasture soils. Escalating fertilizer costs have focused attention on the efficiency of use of S fertilizers, particularly superphosphate (SSP) and alternative elemental S (S 0) based fertilizers less liable to leaching loss in this aquic environment. Field and glasshouse trials, using the resident clover/ryegrass sward on undisturbed soil cores (150 mm diameter, 100 mm depth), were undertaken to determine the comparative short-term fate of SSP and different particle sizes of S 0. Methods for manufacturing radioactively labelled (35 s) fertilizers were developed. In addition, the effect of sheep dung on the short-term immobilization of soil and fertilizer S was also investigated. A simple computer simulation model explaining the observed transformation of soil sulphur and 35 s labelled fertilizer was developed. Initially, the effect of sheep dung on the short-term immobilization of soil and fertilizer S was investigated. Very small amounts (about 2 - 5 %) of plant (clover/ryegrass pasture) S and P, within 1 00 mm of the area surrounding the dung pellet, were derived from the dung. Under the experimental conditions that prevailed, dung S behaved as a slow release S form causing neither greater immobilization of soil or fertilizer S nor mineralization of soil organic S. It was concluded {{that the impact of}} dung return on short-term ( 0. 1 50 m m) which had not oxidized, the major fate of fertilizer 35 s, either under glasshouse or field conditions, was again in soil organic matter mostly formed in the top 33 mm of the soil. Applications of gypsum and SSP caused 35 s to move to the 33 - 1 00 mm soil depths but there was no additional influence of P on the depth to which so 4 = was leached. A preliminary computer simulation model describing the fate of 35 so 4 =-s fertilizer was developed. The model provided a very accurate method of predicting plant uptake of S from both SSP fertilized and u nfertilized soil cores. The model also indicated that, at any particular soil depth, on average, actual rates of mineralizatio n a nd i m mobilization may exceed root uptake of S by 1. 5 to 2 fold (mg S turned over per unit of S taken up by plants). The accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>turnover</b> rate could not be validated because the model gave relatively inaccurate predictions of the measured movement and transformations of 35 s tracer added to the soil as SSP. There was, however, relative similarity between the observed and predicted proportional distribution of 35 s between soil and plant S forms. Such a distribution supported the concept of using root activity as a modifier of mineralization and immobilization rates in order to describe the extent of these processes at different soil depths. The study has emphasized the greater importance of the surface few millimeters of pasture soil in S transformations, important in the fate of fertilizer and pasture plant nutrition. There appears to be scope in manipulating S 0 particle size to improve the efficiency of the S fertilizer used...|$|E

Although <b>estimates</b> of <b>the</b> life span of individual ectomycorrhizas very considerably, turnover is generally considered {{on a scale of}} months. After death, the presence ectomycorrhizas on root tips, may increase the rate of root decomposition for some fungal taxa. Besides host plant death and mycorrhizal turnover, rates of carbon sequestration may also be affected by disturbances in the soil, which cause sections of the extramatrical mycelium to become severed from the host plant. Such disturbances, such as those caused by animal disruption, mycophagous invertebrates or habitat destruction, may have a notable impact on turnover rates. These variables make it difficult to <b>estimate</b> <b>the</b> <b>turnover</b> rates of mycorrhizal biomass in forest soils and the relative contribution of extramatrical mycelium to carbon sequestration.|$|R

40|$|Boreal regions store most of {{the global}} {{terrestrial}} carbon, which can be transferred as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to inland waters with implications for both aquatic ecology and carbon budgets. Headwater riparian zones (RZ) are important sources of DOC, and often just a narrow ‘dominant source layer' (DSL) within the riparian profile is responsible for {{most of the}} DOC export. Two important questions arise: how long boreal RZ could sustain lateral DOC fluxes as the sole source of exported carbon and how its hydromorphological variability influences this role. We <b>estimate</b> theoretical <b>turnover</b> times by comparing carbon pools and lateral exports in the DSL of 13 riparian profiles distributed over a 69 km 2 catchment in northern Sweden. The thickness of the DSL was 36 ± 18 (average ± SD) cm. Thus, only about one-third of the 1 -m-deep riparian profile contributed 90 % of the lateral DOC flux. The 13 RZ exported 8. 7 ± 6. 5 g C m- 2 year- 1, covering the whole range of boreal stream DOC exports. The variation could be explained by local hydromorphological characteristics including RZ width (R 2 = 0. 90). <b>The</b> <b>estimated</b> theoretical <b>turnover</b> times were hundreds to a few thousands of years, that is there is a potential long-lasting supply of DOC. Estimates of net ecosystem production in the RZ suggest that lateral fluxes, including both organic and inorganic C, could be maintained without drawing down the riparian pools. This was supported by measurements of stream DO 14 C that indicated modern carbon as the predominant fraction exported, including streams disturbed by ditching. The transfer of DOC into boreal inland waters from new and old carbon sources has a major influence on surface water quality and global carbon balances. This study highlights the importance of local variations in RZ hydromorphology and DSL extent for future DOC fluxes under a changing climate...|$|R
