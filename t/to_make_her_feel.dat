The break-up severely upsets Amy, and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> better, Leela, Fry, and Bender take her to Forbidden Planet Hollywood. Bender mocks Amy all night, insulting and infuriating her, but this leads the two to have sex because of her interest in [...] "bad boys". After this, Amy and Bender discover a mutual attraction for each other and enter into a [...] "robosexual" [...] relationship, which is taboo in the 31st century. [...] Because it is frowned upon, they keep quiet about their relationship, even to their friends and co-workers. The co-workers grow suspicious, but think little of it.|$|E
500|$|Homer takes Maggie to a daycare and {{encourages}} her {{to enjoy a}} mural featuring Krusty the Clown <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> better while she is away from her parents. However, Krusty arrives to have the images of his face sandblasted from the mural, as his likeness is trademarked and used without his permission. This left Maggie upset and an outraged Homer shoves Krusty in retaliation, sending him flying into a wood chipper and shredded alive. Homer is later approached by two advertising agents who have heard of his deed and explain their plan to use celebrities' likenesses in advertising without issues over permission by simply killing the celebrities who refuse to lend their names to advertising. Homer is then hired as a celebrity assassin, taking out such famous faces as actor George Clooney, singer Prince, and astronaut Neil Armstrong. In Heaven, the dead celebrities are outraged by this and stage {{an attack on the}} living, with Homer as their main target. [...] Krusty's angel kills Homer, who gets revenge by locking [...] all the celebrities out of Heaven, leaving only himself and the apparently gay [...] Abraham Lincoln.|$|E

500|$|Butters and Fazekas {{stated that}} Underwood [...] "doesn’t quite {{understand}} what it’s {{like to be}} a normal woman" [...] after her upbringing in the program, and is intrigued by Carter. Regan elaborated that [...] "she’s never seen anyone like [...] before and she’s never been beaten before. There’s this competitive but playful obsession with her" [...] which is seen with Underwood's [...] "flirtation" [...] and [...] "feminine prowess". Regan continued, [...] "She knows that to be on top she has to beat Peggy ... So Dottie does want to get under her skin. She tries <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable and that might be with a look or a glance or what she says." [...] Atwell said, [...] "Peggy has male baddies that she fights, but to have someone who is physically her equal—she's a Black Widow, incredibly capable and very smart—I think that shows some balance for Peggy, like a flip side of the same coin."

500|$|... "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" [...] {{is a slow}} tempo {{song that}} blends pop and R beats. Additionally, it {{incorporates}} its sound from several instruments including the violin, piano and organ. The ballad {{is set in the}} signature of common time, with a slowly tempo of 52 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major, with Carey's vocals spanning almost three octaves, from the low note of A2 to the high note of F#5. Although the song was written by Carey and Diane Warren, the latter does not usually share songwriting credit. Although there were no conflicts during the recording process, the pair had minor disagreements during the songwriting stages: Carey said that Warren liked to repeat lyrical phrases often. The second song that Carey and Warren wrote together was [...] "There for Me" [...] which was released as a B-side to the [...] "Never Too Far/Hero Medley" [...] charity single Carey recorded in late 2001. The song's protagonist details the struggles of dealing with people who put you down, and how to overcome these struggles through faith, courage, and the power of God. Carey explains in the song's lyrics how although people can try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> down and depressed, no matter what happens, she can't let them win: [...] "There's a light in me that shines brightly. They can try but they can't take that away from me." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the character has been mixed. BuddyTV staff columnist Don Williams deemed the addition of Bela a [...] "cheap ploy" [...] to attract teen male viewers, believing the character distracts viewers from the [...] "brotherly bond that made the show so special in the first place". As well, he felt her [...] "sexy cat burglar act, coupled with her flirtation with one of our heroes, is cliched and has been seen a thousand times before", and he likened her {{to a combination of}} Catwoman and [...] "the equally annoying Electro-Gwen from Angel". However, he later admitted Bela was [...] "a great comic foil". Diana Steenbergen of IGN became [...] "increasingly frustrated" [...] with the [...] "unlikable and manipulative" [...] Bela throughout her appearances. She found the character's tragic backstory to be [...] "too little, too late", but was surprised the writers were able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "even a tiny bit sorry for [...] " [...] during her death scene. Writing that [...] "Bela had a hint of vulnerability that would have been intriguing had we glimpsed it more than 30 seconds before she died", Steenbergen wished the character had been written differently"not either annoying or downright contemptible"and deemed her [...] "a wasted opportunity to give us an interesting female foil for the boys". Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune expressed similar sentiments, voicing her belief in her review of the third season finale [...] "No Rest For The Wicked" [...] that Bela [...] "got gone just as [...] getting interesting". In the same review, Peterson deemed the character to be a [...] "decent traveling [...] ". Although TV Guide's Tina Charles was annoyed that Bela continuously steals from the Winchesters and makes them [...] "look ridiculous", she [...] "really liked" [...] the character. Overall, she felt Cohan [...] "did one hell of a job".|$|E

2500|$|On October 17, 1914, {{he married}} Martha Wheaton Bowers (1889–1958), {{daughter}} of Lloyd Wheaton Bowers and Louisa Bennett Wilson. Taft himself appeared taciturn and coldly intellectual, characteristics that were offset by his gregarious wife, who served {{the same role}} his mother had for his father, as a confidante and powerful asset to her husband's political career. In May 1950, Martha suffered a severe stroke that left her an invalid, leaving her confined to a wheelchair, unable {{to take care of}} herself, and reliant upon her husband, children, and nurses for support. A biographer called his wife's stroke [...] "the deepest personal blow of [...] life...there was no denying that he suffered." [...] Following her stroke, Taft faithfully assisted his wife, called her every night when he was away on business, read stories to her at night when he was at home, [...] "pushed her about in her wheelchair, lifted her in and out of cars...tenderly did his best <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> comfortable and happy, and helped feed and take care of her at public functions" [...] - facts which, his admirers noted, belied his public image as a cold and uncaring person. They had four sons: William Howard Taft III (1915–1991), who became ambassador to Ireland; Robert Alphonso Taft Jr. (1917–1993), who was also elected to the U.S. Senate; Lloyd Bowers Taft (1923–1985), who worked as an investment banker in Cincinnati, and Horace Dwight Taft (1925–1983), who became a professor of physics and dean at Yale. Two of Robert and Martha's grandsons are Robert Alphonso [...] "Bob" [...] Taft III (born 1942), Governor of Ohio from 1999 to 2007, and William Howard Taft IV (born 1945), Deputy Secretary of Defense from 1984 to 1989.|$|E

Even under those harsh financial conditions she displayed unparalleled self-respect and righteousness. She gave up the scholarship meant for girl students who were coming from financially weaker section. Although she knew what the reality was, she never believed that she was weak or vulnerable. Instead of taking the scholarship which would have tagged her and her mother [...] "poor", she decided to protect her self-respect and earn school books and clothes by showing my dance and mimicry skills to the senior girl students.|$|R
5000|$|Ideas {{relating}} to guilt recur throughout the episode. Proclaiming [...] "Wildfire" [...] as an installment [...] "full of guilt trips", Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly explained that Rick Grimes and Andrea epitomized such themes given their situations. [...] "Andrea feels guilty about 'not being there' for Amy—but is motivated towards a mercy. Shane made Rick {{feel bad for}} not being at the camp when the zombies attacked, and Lori didn't do much <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> husband <b>feel</b> better," [...] Snierson stated. [...] "She also told Rick she needs more 'certainties' from him that decisions made from hunch and instinct." [...] A columnist for the same publication, Jeff Jensen stated that [...] "Wildfire" [...] was a commentary on humanity, and added that the episode demonstrated [...] "the need for the group to honor the departed" [...] so they could identify with their humanity.|$|R
2500|$|She also enlisted costume {{designer}} Arianne Phillips {{to create the}} dresses for the film. The costumes designed were a combination of real vintage pieces, others were remade based on patterns that were obtained out of the museum archives, and the rest had to be freshly made. In an interview with W magazine in November 2011, Philips explained that she [...] "started doing research in 2009, a year before [...] began filming... To me, Wallis Simpson was a style icon, but I didn’t know she was a couture client well before she met Edward. She was also a hungry whore for jewelry. Edward gave Wallis jewelry <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> royal. My first task was {{figuring out how to}} re-create those famous gifts." [...] Madonna had sent a box of her research to Phillips, so that the designer could get a head start for the project. The singer understood the kind of attention to detail needed to create the costumes, drawing from her own garments which included couture. Phillips then researched the clothes on display at fashion departments of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in New York, the Musée de la Mode et du Textile in Paris and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. She then went to Los Angeles, where retailer Doris Raymond, from The Way We Wore had opened up her personal library of 1930s couture. There Phillips watched old newsreels from the University of California archives. Once filming started, the designer moved in Madonna's guesthouse in London, where they would watch the shot reels together and scrutinise the dresses. Phillips established contacts with designer labels like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels to replicate a cross bracelet and ten other pieces. For the gowns, undergarments, and dresses needed for the 60costume changes in the film, Phillips scoured the archives of Vionnet and Schiaparelli; then with the cooperation of both houses she redesigned Simpson's clothing. The first dress in which Riseborough appeared as Simpson in the film was a re-creation of the dress owned by Simpson herself. Phillips decked the dresses with diamond bow brooch at the neck and paired with organza skirts, and was able to obtain duplicates for some of them from Cos Prop, a costume shop in London.|$|E

5000|$|Grodstein's inspirations and {{influences}} for A Friend of the Family {{stemmed from the}} 1990s cases of Amy Grossberg and Melissa Drexler, two high school girls both well known for taking the life of their newborn babies shortly after they had given birth. Drexler gave birth at her senior prom and Grossberg delivered a baby {{in a hotel room}} {{with the help of her}} boyfriend, then disposed of it. This situation was the start for her ideas in the main storyline as well as one of her main characters, Laura Stern. Laura Stern was based on both Melissa Drexler and Amy Grossberg. Grodstein's intentions however, were not <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> audience <b>feel</b> like the actions of young women who commit these neonaticides were wrong nor right but <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> readers understand a different side to the [...] "murders" [...] not just the death of a baby but everything behind that, everything that started such a plan to get rid of a life. Grodstein wanted people to feel what it felt like in their positions, how they felt when they first discovered they were pregnant, and/or how they felt after they delivered.|$|R

30|$|PD facilitators {{encounter}} {{such situations}} {{on a regular}} basis. Just as teachers in the classroom, they have to constantly anticipate the mathematical relevance of a teacher statement and need to decide in-the-moment how to proceed. The in-the-moment decision-making includes reflections such as the following: Should I just give Jane an answer right away? What mathematics content am I going to address next? How can I value Jane’s question positively <b>to</b> not <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> like {{she does not know}} much about probability and statistics? These {{are just some of the}} possible decisions mathematics PD facilitators might keep in mind when leading a PD course with the explicit goal to support teachers’ mathematics learning. The facilitator in our example has extensive experience in providing PD, and was thus able to allow for a little detour to clarify the underlying mathematical concept. The question remains, however, how would novice facilitators act in such a situation? And more importantly, how can they gain such an expertise that normally develops over time and with practice? In our research project, we build on such situations that are crucial for teacher learning and question how PD facilitators can enhance their capability to respond adequately. Particularly, we scrutinize how material for “facilitator PD” can be designed to enable facilitators-in-training to later provide robust opportunities for teachers’ mathematical learning in PD courses they facilitate on their own.|$|R

She knew I knew all: and indeed, I believe, so strong was her {{prejudice}} against me, that she thought I was an indelicate villain, capable of betraying a lady, which I would scorn to do; so that she trembled before me as a child before its schoolmaster. She would, in her woman's way, too, make all sorts of jokes and sneers at me on reception days; ask about my palace in Ireland, and the kings my ancestors, and whether, when I was a private in Bulow's foot, my royal relatives had interposed to rescue me, and whether the cane was smartly administered there,--anything to mortify me. But, Heaven bless you! I can make allowances for people, and used to laugh in her face. Whilst her jibes and jeers were continuing, it was my pleasure to look at poor Magny and see how HE bore them. The poor devil was trembling lest I should break out under the Princess's sarcasm and tell all; but my revenge was, when the Princess attacked me, to say something bitter to HIM,--to pass it on, as boys do at school. And THAT was the thing which used <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> Highness <b>feel.</b> She would wince just as much when I attacked Magny as if I had been saying anything rude to herself.

40|$|In {{the present}} research, we {{investigated}} helpless {{behavior and the}} responses it elicits from others. Study One used the act-frequency approach to develop a self-report measure of prototypically helpless behaviors. In a sample of college students (n = 75), this measure was validated against ratings by others. Many of the prototypically helpless behaviors we identified were interpersonal in nature, implying that they entail dependency and perhaps manipulativeness. In Study Two, we asked young adult (n = 249) Ss how they responded to people who showed varying amounts of helplessness. The most frequent response {{was trying to help}} the helpless individual feel better. As the frequency of helpless behavior increased, people were less likely <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him or <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> better, less likely {{to go along with the}} helpless individual, more likely to become angry and more likely to ignore or avoid this individual. Implications of these results for applications of the learned helplessness model were discussed, in particular the need to be cautious in assuming that all instances of observed passivity are good examples of learned helplessness...|$|R
