500|$|With Disney's backing, the {{production}} team was {{given access to}} 36 hours of Travers' audio recordings of herself, the Shermans, and co-writer Don DaGradi that were produced during the development of Mary Poppins, in addition to letters written between Disney and Travers from the 1940s through the 1960s. Richard M. Sherman also worked on the film as a music supervisor and shared his side of his experiences working with Travers on Mary Poppins. Initially, Hancock had reservations about Disney's involvement with the film, believing that the studio would edit the screenplay in their co-founder's favor. However, Marcel admitted that the studio [...] "specifically didn't {{want to come in}} and sanitize it or change Walt in any way." [...] Hancock elaborated, [...] "I was still worried that they might want to chip away at Walt a little bit...I thought the portrayal of Walt was fair and human so I came in and they said, ‘No, we like it.’ But still, every step of <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my fist balled up behind my back ready to fight in case it happened, but it didn’t." [...] Although the filmmakers did not receive any creative interference from Disney regarding Walt Disney's depiction, the studio did request that they omit any onscreen inhalation of cigarettes due to the company's policy of not directly depicting smoking in films released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner, and to avoid receiving an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Instead, Disney is shown extinguishing a lit cigarette in one scene, and his notorious smoker's cough is heard off-screen several times throughout the film.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2005 {{issue of}} his company's newsletter, Battle Cry, Chick {{reported}} that he had a life-threatening health emergency sometime between 2003 and 2005 and said, [...] "My flu turned into pneumonia, my blood sugar dropped to 20 (I am diabetic)... I was going into a coma. My wife called 911 and while they were on <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a heart attack. A day or so later I had to undergo a triple bypass." ...|$|E
2500|$|Love Equals Death {{proved to}} be a strong band and a fun band to be in, but I never felt {{comfortable}} in the band. I never felt like it was my band or that I was really a part of everyone else here ... Right before I joined LED, I started a solo project that I put on the back burner, because things were going well with LED and I ended up getting too busy to focus on it. I kept writing songs for both LED and the solo shit, knowing one day I would have to part ways with LED to fulfill my desire to express myself <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> always dreamed. I was going to do this sooner and then [...] So I stayed to help get the band back on track and I never leave anything on a negative note.|$|E
60|$|The other {{objection}} I find urged {{against the}} beginning of polities, in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> mentioned, is this, viz.|$|R
6000|$|LADY CHILTERN. Compromise? Robert, why do {{you talk}} so {{differently}} to-night from <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always heard you talk? Why are you changed? ...|$|R

2500|$|After the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell {{became an}} outspoken {{supporter}} {{of gun control}} and a major figure in the Million Mom March. During the April 19, 1999 broadcast of her talk show, she stated, [...] "You {{are not allowed to}} own a gun, and if you do own a gun, I think you should go to prison." [...] O'Donnell previously had remarked, [...] "I don't personally own a gun, but if you are qualified, licensed and registered, I have no problem." [...] In May 1999, a month after the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell interviewed Tom Selleck, who was promoting The Love Letter. O'Donnell confronted him about his recent commercial for the National Rifle Association (NRA) and challenged him about the NRA's position on the use of [...] "assault weapons." [...] She said {{at the end of the}} segment the conversation had [...] "not gone <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hoped" [...] and added [...] "if you feel insulted by my questions, I apologize because it was not a personal attack. It was meant to bring up the subject as it is in the consciousness of so many today." [...] Around the same time, the cast from Annie Get Your Gun was to appear on the show but refused O'Donnell's request to remove the line [...] "I can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge" [...] from the song [...] "Anything You Can Do" [...] and agreed to perform [...] "My Defenses Are Down" [...] instead.|$|E
60|$|Alexander Abraham groaned, but I {{could see}} that <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> looked him over had chastened him considerably.|$|E
60|$|Well, I couldn't {{contradict}} her, {{not after}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen him {{looking at her}} across the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{to congratulate}} you," [...] said Wellbourne. [...] "Your opera looked {{like being a}} big thing when I left London. You didn't sell outright, I hope?" ...|$|R
60|$|By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{just found}} <b>the</b> letter he wrote me, {{offering}} this staff position. Please keep it carefully, {{as it is}} something I shall value all my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am rested," [...] she {{answered}} softly, [...] "but {{do not be}} long. The car is outside, and on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> more {{to tell you about}} Nicholas Fenn." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{suddenly}} I became {{still more}} surprised at myself, at <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> somehow {{taken for granted}} things which did appear queer when one thought them out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{why did you}} {{pretend to}} like <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done it," [...] Maxwell demanded, angrily, [...] "if you think she will take the honors from him?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{led the way}} to {{my house}} in silence, and rather pleased with myself for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> managed the talk, for I like a man to keep his self-respect.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir; I am {{thinking}} of riding with you to-morrow at any rate. The route lies on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to go, and I am sure to be watched here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ("That's {{exactly the}} method," [...] the Bellman bold [...] In a hasty {{parenthesis}} cried, [...] "That's exactly <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always been told [...] That {{the capture of}} Snarks should be tried!") ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not going}} to try to persuade you. The czar has treated me well, and I love him. By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not given you my name after all. It's Terence Kelly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Work!" [...] I {{said with}} an effort at the heroic, and turned about with a sigh, and I was glad that <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to go would at least take me to my mother. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{cried the}} girl, anticipating the inquiry. [...] "Yes! She went <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> shown her. Then I came in, and Mrs. Snagsby came behind me from somewhere and laid hold of me, and I was frightened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It wasn't quite that. She {{had grown}} up in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> expected, but she had somehow grown beyond it. In fact, though I used {{to be a kind of}} elder brother, she had caught me up and left me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think it's {{very much}} out of <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> hardly ever spoken to you before. If you will only leave me now there shall not be a word more said about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whitaker," [...] {{said the}} lady peremptorily, [...] "I desire you to provide Master Bridgenorth's bedding and food in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{signified}} to you; and to behave yourself towards him in all civility." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I saw you, Mr. Davies, only I {{could not}} stop the song to say how do you do. By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{to thank you for}} coming to inquire after me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{said nothing}} about secrecy," [...] said Edmund; [...] "in fact I think {{attempting}} it, only results in making one look foolish. Yes, you are welcome to tell whom you please as soon as I am out of <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> rather the Lyddells know." ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{walked along}} the street I {{could not help but}} ponder over <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been treated. My uncle's manner towards me was getting harsher every day. If it kept up in this fashion soon the time would come when human nature could stand it no longer.|$|E
60|$|An officer ordered {{several other}} warriors to {{accompany}} him, {{and a moment}} later we were retracing <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> just come. My friend walked close beside me, asking many silly questions about the country from which I had come, until finally his fellows paid no further attention to him or his gabbling.|$|E
6000|$|... "God {{bless you}} for {{promising}} to come," [...] cried our client. [...] "It gives me fresh life {{to know that}} something is being done. By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had a letter from Lord Holdhurst." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> enough. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to do something. I don't want my {{children}} to <b>have</b> to live <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to. <b>I</b> want everyone to live in peace. ... I am leaving money for the funeral and to pay my debts.|$|R
60|$|So {{that there}} can be no doubt {{whatsoever}} that any plant and any animal may vary in nature; that varieties may arise in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> described,--as spontaneous varieties,--and that those varieties may be perpetuated in <b>the</b> same <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> shown you spontaneous varieties are perpetuated; I say, therefore, {{that there can}} be no doubt as to the origin and perpetuation of varieties in nature.|$|R
6000|$|... "Willie," [...] {{she cried}} {{with a sudden}} directness, with her eyes {{appealing}} to me, [...] "I didn't mean to treat you badly--indeed I didn't. I kept thinking of you--and of father and mother, all the time. Only it didn't seem to move me. It didn't move me not one bit from <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> chosen." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was in this}} {{suggestion}} a quality of Tedham's old insinuation, but coarser, inferior, as if his insinuation had degenerated into something like mere animal cunning. I felt rather ashamed for him, but to my surprise, my wife seemed only to feel sorry, and did not repel his suggestion in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> thought she would.|$|E
60|$|But {{the fellows}} were {{pressing}} me; and as I {{did not know}} the way at all, I soon saw that they would overtake me unless I found a place to conceal myself until they had passed, which would then give me an opportunity to return <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come and regain the tower, or possibly find a way to reach the city streets.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, Captain Seccombe, I am a {{passenger}} on board this ship, and know neither her business here nor why she has behaved {{in a fashion}} that makes me blush for her flag--which, by <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> every reason to abominate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are some}} time ahead of me," [...] Mr. Waddington pointed out. [...] "None of these {{warnings}} {{have come to}} you yet. It may be something wrong with my disposition, or <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> swallowed my bean. Yours may be a permanent affair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, I {{can only}} {{give you a}} very general answer to that for the moment. By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been reading a short but clear and {{interesting}} account of the old building, purchasable at the modest sum of one penny from the local tobacconist." ...|$|R
