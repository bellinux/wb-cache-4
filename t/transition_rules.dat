In the present paper, we examine the state <b>transition</b> <b>rule</b> sets for the famous firing squad synchronization algorithms that give a finite-state protocol for synchronizing large-scale cellular automata and present a comparative study of the optimum-time synchronization protocols for one-dimensional cellular automata.

We show that the first <b>transition</b> <b>rule</b> set designed by Waksman [23] includes fundamental errors which cause unsuccessful firings and that ninety-three percent of the rules are redundant. In addition, the <b>transition</b> <b>rule</b> sets reported by Balzer [1], Gerken [4] and Mazoyer [8] are found to include several redundant rules.
