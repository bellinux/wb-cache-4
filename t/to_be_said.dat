5|$|By {{the early}} 940s Constantine {{was an old}} man, perhaps more than 70 years of age. The kingdom of Alba was too new <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to have a {{customary}} rule of succession, but Pictish and Irish precedents favoured an adult successor descended from Kenneth MacAlpin. Constantine's surviving son Indulf, probably baptised in 927, {{would have been too}} young to be a serious candidate for the kingship in the early 940s, and the obvious heir was Constantine's nephew, MalcolmI. As Malcolm was born no later than 901, by the 940s he was no longer a young man, and may have been impatient. Willingly or not—the 11th-century Prophecy of Berchán, a verse history {{in the form of a}} supposed prophecy, states that it was not a voluntary decision—Constantine abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to Malcolm.|$|E
5|$|Golondrina {{points are}} {{widespread}} {{across much of}} central, southern, and western Texas, with distribution extending northward along the Balcones Escarpment. They are particularly prevalent across the South Texas Plains, so much so as <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to represent the first unique cultural pattern in the area. Most Golondrina specimens from the South Texas Plains are not excavated but rather found on the site's surface. They often appear as part of mixed collections with artifacts of later periods. Several sites have also been found in Arkansas {{as well as in}} the Lower Pecos Canyonlands and the Mexican states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León.|$|E
5|$|In Mongolia, the Khalkha dialect, {{written in}} Cyrillic (and {{at times in}} Latin for social networking), is predominant, while in Inner Mongolia, the {{language}} is dialectally more diverse and is written in the traditional Mongolian script. In the discussion of grammar to follow, the variety of Mongolian treated is Standard Khalkha Mongolian (i.e., the standard written language as formalized in the writing conventions and in the school grammar), but {{much of what is}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> is also valid for vernacular (spoken) Khalkha and for other Mongolian dialects, especially Chakhar.|$|E

5|$|Since the Reformation, {{the nave}} {{is that part}} of the {{building}} which is usually open to and most used by the congregation and general public. There is also, usually in the nave, a raised pulpit from which the dean or other clergy can expound the scriptures. In the late 20th century it became customary in some cathedrals for an hourly prayer <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said,</b> for the benefit of visitors, and this is often presented from the nave pulpit. In a large cathedral, particularly in those where the building is divided by a screen as at Canterbury, an altar may be set at the eastern end of the nave so that services might be held there for large congregations. At each place where services are held there is a lectern on which rests a Bible.|$|E
5|$|The Jardin des Mont du Récollets {{provides}} expansive views {{over the}} plains of Flanders and beyond; {{on a clear day}} it is possible to see the North Sea, the English coast and the belfry of Bruges. It used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that from Cassel one could see five kingdoms: France, Belgium, Holland, England and Heaven. The garden also hosts an equestrian statue of Marshal Foch and the Monument des Trois Batailles, commemorating the battles of 1071, 1328 and 1677. Just below the gardens is the Porte du Château of 1621, the last substantial part of the old castle to remain standing. The city walls no longer stand but footpaths and streets still trace their former course.|$|E
