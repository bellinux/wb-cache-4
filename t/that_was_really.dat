25|$|With the Bolshevik victory, Swenson {{found not}} just two schooners but his entire Siberian {{business}} and stock impounded and a warrant {{out for his}} arrest. The issues besides alcohol (if <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> an issue) were taxes and his perceived close association with the Whites. He briefly discusses allegations of selling guns to the Whites, suggesting they were inflated, and attributes some allegations to disgruntled competitors. (Hunting arms and ammunition were {{a regular part of}} his business.) He does not mention an allegation of a check for $500,000 found in the pocket of an executed White officer. Swenson reports he declined an offer from a former White officer to raid the coast and recover the furs by force. Instead he and R.S. Pollister (Vice President of Olaf Swenson & Co.) went to China to obtain a Soviet visa and began a long slow process of negotiation to release the furs, trading stock, and books. The ultimate resolution was a contract entered in 1925 to deliver goods in Siberia to Moscow's specification on a cost-plus basis and export furs. This contract was renewed for five years in 1926 and expanded in 1928 after negotiations {{with the head of the}} Soviet fur trust in London. Other associates in this venture were Maurice Cantor and Irving W. Herskovits of New York. In this period, the business name often appears as Swenson Trading Company or Swenson Fur Trading Company. Local trade was handled by a Soviet government trading organization which specified the goods and set fur prices. Swenson reports prices paid to the trappers were reduced in this period and the range of trade goods narrowed to necessities.|$|E

500|$|... "Kaddish" [...] {{was written}} by {{producer}} Howard Gordon and directed by Kim Manners. The episode was dedicated {{to the memory of}} Lillian Katz, Gordon's grandmother.

He noted, [...] "I was always compelled by the Golem mythology. We had never dealt with the horrors of antisemitism {{and the power of the}} word [...] And because I'm Jewish, it was something <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> compelling to me personally."

[...] He ended up disliking the final product because he sang it [...] "in a register <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> too high for [...] singing voice".

She pointed to later movies, such as Mamma Mia!, 27 Dresses (written by McKenna) and Me Before You, that appeared to her to be trying to replicate The Devil Wears Pradas success with that demographic. However, Gabler feels they did not do so as well. [...] "Prada reminds me of movies that we don't have a lot of now—it harkens back to classic movies that had so much more than just one kind of plot line ... You just keep wanting to find something that can touch upon the same zeitgeist as this film." ...|$|E
500|$|This episode {{does not}} feature Scully, as Gillian Anderson was busy still filming her final parts of Fight the Future. Noted actor Darren McGavin appears as Arthur Dales.

He always had Darren in mind to use somewhere, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> his doing. He said 'I want Darren McGavin for this,' and {{he happened to be}} available, and we got him." [...] McGavin had originally been casting directors' first choice for the role of Senator Matheson for the second season opener [...] "Little Green Men".
