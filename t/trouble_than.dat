He manages to kill the leader, Alex McAuley, and then bring the whole gang down in retaliation. Tobey and Callie Rose become a couple and both go on to study law at university.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} main Confederate army was marching through Pennsylvania, Lincoln {{was unable to}} give Meade more firepower. The vast {{majority}} of the 700,000 Federal soldiers (except for Grant's 70,000 near Vicksburg) were noncombatants, held static defensive posts that Lincoln feared to uncover, or like Rosecrans at Nashville, they were afraid to move. Urgently the President called for 100,000 civilian militiamen to turn out for the emergency; being unorganized, untrained, unequipped and poorly led, they were more <b>trouble</b> <b>than</b> they were worth. When the battle began they broke and ran away.|$|E

25|$|A rematch between Vic Darchinyan and Nonito Donaire {{took place}} on 9 November 2013. The 37-year-old Darchinyan gave the 30-year-old Donaire a lot more <b>trouble</b> <b>than</b> was expected, as this was {{intended}} to be an easy bounce-back fight for Donaire who was coming off his first loss in over a decade. Darchinyan fought a smarter fight and confused a sluggish Donaire for much of the first 8 rounds, but in the 9th round round was dropped and got up to be finished by TKO. At the time of the stoppage, Darchinyan was leading on the scorecards: 78-74, 78-74, and 76-76.|$|E
25|$|As for Die Walküre, {{the first}} act of this opera {{probably}} gave Wagner more <b>trouble</b> <b>than</b> any other act in the entire tetralogy. In his two prose sketches for it Wotan enters Hunding's house in his guise as Der Wanderer ("The Wanderer") and thrusts the sword into the ash tree, which Siegmund then withdraws only minutes later; the fully worked-out prose draft also brings Wotan onto the stage. It was only at a later stage {{in the evolution of}} the text that Wagner banished the Wanderer and his sword to the backstory which Sieglinde narrates to Siegmund. Now the sword is already embedded in the tree as the curtain goes up on Act 1 and Siegmund's withdrawal of it becomes a climactic piece of dramaturgy.|$|E
25|$|Many boxing {{analysts and}} experts said that Darren Barker has {{the skills and}} ring generalship to one day become a champion, but that his skills were not perfected enough to do {{anything}} against Martínez. The first few rounds showed that Barker was actually able to make Martínez uncomfortable in the ring and give him more <b>trouble</b> <b>than</b> expected. Throughout the fight, Barker consistently gave Martínez problems, while never hurting him or really ever winning any of the rounds, he gave Martínez a challenge by coming in but not giving much offence to let Martínez counter or land anything clean. He also managed to get Martínez's nose to bleed early in the rounds by an upper-cut. Martínez, however, fought through the difficulty and eventually found openings {{which led to a}} knock-out of Barker, in the 11th with a right hook.|$|E

25|$|In the {{intervening}} period, AMC replaced Kaplan's race program contact with two new men (Chris Schoenlip and John Voelbel from Lever Brothers (soap marketing people)), {{who had no}} experience in the automotive field and were ignorant of {{anything to do with}} racing. They would ultimately prove to be more <b>trouble</b> <b>than</b> they were worth. In fact, it was these two new boys who failed to enter the parts into the official AMC parts system and to submit homologation papers. The importance of this mistake became clear when Kaplan sent the first car to run at the first race of the 1969 season at Jackson, Michigan. Kaplan sent one of the older 1968 cars with a new engine, but, because they were late and had not qualified, the team had to do some consensus building among the other racers to permit them to enter at all. When the SCCA agreed to let them run, they started last, but, within 10 laps, they were chasing Donohue down and the time differential was narrowing rapidly. After the race, the SCCA asked to see the engine, but he had sent the cars home already. At Lime Rock, the SCCA wanted to tear down the engines before they could start the race. Kaplan bought some time by countering with the challenge {{that they would have to}} tear down the Camaros and Mustangs too. That wasn’t going to happen, so they were allowed to run. It was clear, however, that the problems with the SCCA weren’t going away, at least until the parts could be homologated.|$|E
500|$|The {{first run}} of engine R1 {{took place at}} Rolls-Royce's Derby factory on 7 April 1929 with R7 running the next day. Many {{mechanical}} failures were experienced during bench testing including burnt valves, connecting rod breakages and main bearing seizures, while considerably more <b>trouble</b> <b>than</b> expected occurred with valve springs; at one time two or three would be found broken after a 10-minute run, but the continual redesigning and testing of components reduced all these problems. Unknown to Royce himself, the engineers had also fitted [...] "Wellworthy" [...] pistons that were better able to withstand the 13tons [...] "pressure" [...] of each firing stroke.|$|E

I had already used the obvious word {{hypothesis}} {{in the sequence}} hypothesis, and in addition I wanted {{to suggest that this}} new assumption was more central and more powerful. ... As it turned out, {{the use of the word}} dogma caused almost more <b>trouble</b> <b>than</b> it was worth. Many years later Jacques Monod pointed out to me that I did not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief that cannot be doubted. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since I thought that all religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of the world does, and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support." ...|$|E

'In {{the first}} place,' said Fakredeen, 'until this accursed peace intrigue {{of the foreign}} consuls, which will not {{last as long as}} the carnival, the Mountain was more <b>troubled</b> <b>than</b> ever, and the Porte, backed up by Sir Canning, is obstinate against any prince of our house exercising the rule.' ...|$|R
500|$|During season two, Perrineau stated [...] "'s nicer than I {{expected}} him to be. Or, he is nicer so far than I {{expected him}} to be ... I try to take characters that I think are challenging and a little complicated and hopefully really smart and thoughtful and compassionate. I think Michael is all those things. He seems {{to have a lot of}} bad luck." [...] He defends Michael's behavior in season two, saying [...] " [...] keeps stepping into more <b>trouble</b> <b>than</b> he actually asked for". Cynthia Littleton of Variety described Michael as [...] "one of the most interesting of the Oceanic 815-ers: flawed, tortured, hard to read, volatile, fighting his innate talents, his own worst enemy, at times, and at others, a totally stand-up guy." [...] IGN's Chris Carabott calls Michael a [...] "natural" [...] father. Michael is known for frequently shouting [...] "Walt!", [...] "Where's my son!" [...] and [...] "Have you seen my boy?".|$|E
500|$|Prokofiev's {{task was}} not straightforward; the film's 15 minutes of musical {{material}} was fragmentary, and scored {{for a small}} chamber orchestra. According to Prokofiev's own account, producing the suite was [...] "a devilish job", which, he said, [...] "gave me much more <b>trouble</b> <b>than</b> the music for the film itself, since I had to find the proper form, re-orchestrate the whole thing, polish it up and even combine some of the themes." [...] He wanted the suite to appeal to Soviet audiences hearing concert music for the first time. In an article in Izvestia in 1934 he wrote of such music: [...] "Above all, it must be melodious; moreover the melody must be simple and comprehensible without being repetitive or trivial... The simplicity should not be an old-fashioned simplicity but a new simplicity". He worked quickly, and had finished the piece by 8 July 1934. Because it was published (Op. 60) by his regular music publisher in Paris, the French form of [...] "Kijé" [...] rather than the Russian [...] "Kizhe" [...] was adopted in the work's title.|$|E
500|$|The ship entered {{service in}} 1866 with the Baltic Fleet. She accidentally {{collided}} with and sank the wooden steam frigate [...] on 15 August 1869, killing 16 men from Oleg, but Kreml {{was only slightly}} damaged. She {{was assigned to the}} Gunnery Training Detachment in March 1870 and remained with it for the bulk of her career. In November 1881, the steam-powered steering gear taken from the ironclad [...] was installed which required the installation of a high-pressure donkey boiler in the cramped boiler room. This proved to be more <b>trouble</b> <b>than</b> it was worth and was removed two years later. Kreml was caught by a storm on 10 June 1885 while sailing for Reval (Tallinn) and began taking on so much water that her captain decided to make for shallow water; she reached Kunda Bay, on the Estonian coast, under sail alone after her engine bearings overheated and forced the engine to be stopped. Once there, the progressive flooding continued through the ventilation shafts, sounding tubes, and defective valves in the internal bulkheads, and the ship sank in [...] of water. Kreml was refloated on five days later and repaired in Kronstadt. She was reclassified as coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and placed in reserve on 24 December 1904. Kreml was disarmed and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 15 September 1905. She was stricken from the Navy List on 12 October and sold for scrap on 8 September 1908.|$|E

2500|$|Valentino went on {{to claim}} that artistic control {{was more of an}} issue than the money. He wrote an open letter to Photoplay magazine, titled [...] "Open Letter to the American Public", where he argued his case, {{although}} the average American had trouble sympathizing, as most made $2,000 a year. Famous Players made their own public statements deeming him more <b>trouble</b> <b>than</b> he was worth (the divorce, bigamy trials, debts) and that he was temperamental, almost diva-like.

2500|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, Thompson {{was said to}} be working on a novel called Polo Is My Life, which was briefly excerpted in Rolling Stone in 1994, and which Thompson himself {{described}} in 1996 as [...] "...a sex book— you know, sex, drugs and rock and roll. It's about the manager of a sex theater who's forced to leave and flee to the mountains. He falls in love and gets in even more <b>trouble</b> <b>than</b> he was in the sex theater in San Francisco". The novel was slated to be released by Random House in 1999, and was even assigned , but was not published.|$|E

As its stadium was situated in a staunchly republican area once known as [...] "Free Derry", with a history of scepticism towards the RUC in the local community, Derry received special permission from UEFA to steward its own games.

Such was his popularity that two medals were struck in celebration of his acquittal. [...] The government, however, declined to leave Lilburne at large. The jurymen were summoned before the Council of State, and the Council of State was ordered to secure Lilburne. On 28 August he was transferred from Newgate Prison to the Tower of London, and the Lieutenant of the Tower was instructed by parliament to refuse obedience to any writ of habeas corpus. On 16 March 1654, the Council ordered that he should be removed to Mount Orgueil Castle, Jersey. Colonel Robert Gibbon, the governor, complained that he gave more <b>trouble</b> <b>than</b> ten cavaliers.|$|E
