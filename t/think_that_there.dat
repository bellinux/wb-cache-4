25|$|Finally, {{though not}} an {{approach}} investigating {{some kind of}} rules, there is a criticism by James M. Buchanan, Charles Plott, and others. It argues that it is silly to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> might be social preferences that are analogous to individual preferences. Arrow (1963, Chapter 8) answers this sort of criticism seen in the early period, which come at least partly from misunderstanding.|$|E
25|$|When {{scientists}} use {{the idea}} of parsimony, it has meaning only in a very specific context of inquiry.

Mary Edwards Werstch writes about her experiences, as well as the experiences of those she has interviewed, in her book Brats: Growing up inside the Fortress.

25|$|In 1961, the {{government}} decided to introduce decimal currency into the country. This necessitated the surcharging of stamps to reflect this change. Six stamps were chosen from various issues and overprinted {{with the following}} denominations: 1 paisa, 2 paisas, 3 paisas, 7 paisas, 13 paisas (2 designs). Their printing was divided between two local printers, both based in Karachi: Pakistan Security Printing Corporation (PSPC) and Time Press, Karachi. Times Press used many plates for printing which resulted in varieties and shifts. Service stamps with decimal surcharges were also printed by the same printers. Forgeries in this issue exist in such numbers that they make the average person <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are more errors and varieties than in fact. In the 2 paisas Service stamps, errors including service on front and surcharge on gum side are forgeries.|$|E

500|$|In The New York Times, book {{reviewer}} Geoffrey Wheatcroft {{said that}} A Moral Reckoning (2003) presents {{an indictment of}} the Roman Catholic Church comparable to Goldhagen's indictment of Germany in Hitler's Willing Executioners (1996), saying, [...] "both as an international institution {{under the leadership of}} Pope Pius XII (1939–58), and at national levels in many European countries, the Church was deeply implicated in the appalling genocide.... Just as Germans had been carefully taught to hate the Jews, {{to the point that they}} could readily torment and kill them, so had Catholics"; that author Goldhagen [...] "sees a deep vein of Jew-hatred ingrained within Catholic tradition; and he does not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was any difference of kind, between that old religious Jew-hatred and the murderous racial antisemitism of the twentieth century".|$|E

[...] He was also critical of the Scientology organization leadership, including its head David Miscavige: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are probably things of Scientology that are valuable and that can help people - my main issue is not with Scientology per se, it is with Scientology the organization - it is a corrupt I believe and probably a criminal endeavor, and that has to do with people who are in charge of Scientology mainly David Miscavige..." ...|$|E
500|$|Some modern authors {{suggest that}} Druitt was {{dismissed}} {{because he was}} a homosexual or pederast and that may have driven him to suicide. One speculation is that the money found on his body was going to be used for payment to a blackmailer. Others, however, <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no evidence of homosexuality and that his suicide was instead precipitated by an hereditary psychiatric illness. His mother suffered from depression and was institutionalised from July 1888. She died in an asylum in Chiswick in 1890. His maternal grandmother committed suicide while insane, his aunt attempted suicide., and his eldest sister committed suicide in old age. A note written by Druitt and addressed to his brother William, who was a solicitor in Bournemouth, was found in Druitt's room in Blackheath. It read, [...] "Since Friday I felt that I {{was going to be like}} mother, and the best thing for me was to die." ...|$|E

500|$|The Blu-ray {{version was}} {{released}} on 2 December 2008. It contains audio in English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and Thai, and subtitles in 10 languages. Glenn Erickson of DVD Talk also criticized the film, yet praised the Blu-ray release, rating it 4½ [...] stars out of 5 for its video quality and 4 out of 5 for its audio, though only giving it 1½ stars for its extras, noting the lack of special features. A review from Blu-Ray.com also gave a favourable review of both the audio and visual quality, stating [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is much here one could be dissatisfied with." [...] High-Def Digest, however, gave a more negative review. Whilst praising the audio quality, the lack of special features was criticized, as was the video quality, which was described as being [...] "smothered" [...] with edge enhancement.

500|$|Kenyatta and his {{government}} were anti-communist, and in June 1965 he warned that [...] "it is naive to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no danger of imperialism from the East. In world power politics the East has as much designs upon us as the West {{and would like to}} serve their own interests." [...] His governance was often criticised by communists and other leftists, some of whom accused him of being a fascist. When Chinese Communist official Zhou Enlai visited Dar es Salaam, his statement that [...] "Africa is ripe for revolution" [...] was clearly aimed largely at Kenya. In 1964, Kenyatta impounded a secret shipment of Chinese armaments that passed through Kenyan territory on its way to Uganda. Obote personally visited Kenyatta to apologise. In June 1967, Kenyatta declared the Chinese Chargé d'Affairs persona non grata in Kenya and recalled the Kenyan ambassador from Peking. Relations with the Soviet Union were also strained; Kenyatta shut down the Lumumba Institute—an organisation named after the Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba—on the basis that it was a front for Soviet influence in Kenya.|$|E
500|$|The French Republic, {{established}} in 1792 {{at the height}} of the French Revolution, was by 1797 governed by a bicameral legislative assembly, with a five-member Directory acting as the national executive. [...] The Directory was undergoing both internal power struggles and struggles with the Council of Five Hundred, the lower chamber of the legislature. [...] Ministerial changes took place in the first half of 1797, including the selection in July of Charles Maurice de Talleyrand as foreign minister. [...] Talleyrand, who had recently spent a few years in the United States, was openly concerned about the establishment of closer ties between the U. S. and Britain. [...] The Directory, generally not well-disposed to American interests, became notably more hostile to them in September 1797, when an internal coup propelled several anti-Americans into power. [...] These leaders, and Talleyrand, viewed President Adams as hostile to their interests, but did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was significant danger of war. [...] In part based on advice imparted to French diplomats by Thomas Jefferson, Talleyrand decided to adopt a measured, slow pace to the negotiations.|$|E

500|$|After Hayes' falling-out {{with the}} Republican Party and a {{perceived}} desire {{on the part}} of the United States' electorate for a strong man in the White House, Grant returned to the United States ahead of schedule, in hopes of seeking a third term in office. With the backing of the Stalwarts and calls for a [...] "man of iron" [...] to replace the [...] "man of straw" [...] in the White House, Grant was confident that he would receive the Republican nomination for the presidency. Roscoe Conkling, the leader of the Stalwart faction, formed a [...] "triumvirate" [...] with J. Donald Cameron of Pennsylvania and John A. Logan of Illinois to lead the campaign for Grant's return to the White House. With a Grant victory, Conkling and other Stalwarts would have great influence in the White House. Grant knew he could count on the Stalwart leaders to solidify their respective states in order to guarantee a Grant victory. Conkling was so confident in Grant's nomination that he said, [...] "Nothing but an act of God could prevent Grant's nomination."

Claiming that he was [...] "hooked" [...] to the show, Folwer concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "9 out of 10" [...] classifying it as [...] "amazing". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club enjoyed the episode. In his [...] "A-" [...] review, he noted that the episode [...] "doesn't show any signs of imminent immolation". He thought that the morale of the episode was [...] "wanting something to be real doesn't make it easier to pretend, and the harder Michael has to work to keep this up, the better the odds that he’s going to lose his grip". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix [...] "loved" [...] the episode.

[...] On the location for a third season, Fazekas stated that moving the series to London had been a possibility, an idea that creators Markus and McFeely had early on. Fazekas added, [...] "you can put the show anywhere, because it's spies. [...] all going to be determined by what story we want to tell.

[...] Fazekas also said that seeds for a third season had been planted all throughout the second, and {{that the end of the}} second season, with someone shooting Thompson and taking the M.
