5|$|Wolves {{supplement}} their diet with {{fruit and vegetable}} matter. They willingly eat the berries of mountain ash, lily of the valley, bilberries, blueberries and cowberry. Other fruits include nightshade, apples and pears. They readily visit melon fields during the summer months. A well-fed wolf stores fat under <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> <b>around</b> the heart, intestines, kidneys, and bone marrow, particularly during the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|The pudendal nerve is {{the main}} nerve of the perineum. It carries {{sensation}} from the external genitalia of both sexes and <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> the anus and perineum, as well the motor supply to various pelvic muscles, including the male or female external urethral sphincter and the external anal sphincter. If damaged, most commonly by childbirth, lesions may cause sensory loss or fecal incontinence. The nerve may be temporarily blocked {{as part of an}} anaesthetic procedure.|$|E
5|$|Epaulette {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger fishes such as other sharks. Its {{coloration}} provides protective camouflage, while its epaulette is speculated {{to be an}} eyespot for distracting or deterring predators. Epaulette sharks are almost all parasitized by the praniza (parasitic) larval stage of gnathiid isopods. The larvae feed on blood and mostly attach to <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> the cloaca and the claspers, though they are also found inside the mouth and on the gills. These parasites cause little damage and are not believed to adversely affect {{the health of the}} shark. Other parasites of this species include a species of myxosporean in the genus Kudoa, which infests the skeletal muscles, the hemogregarine protozoan Haemogregarina hemiscyllii, which infects the blood, the ostracod Sheina orri, which attaches to the gills, and the nematode Proleptus australis, which infests the stomach.|$|E
50|$|The male has {{a larger}} casque {{on a dark}} bill, and the culmen and lower {{mandible}} are yellowish. <b>The</b> bare <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> eye is dark in the male, but sometimes pale reddish in females. The female has a more yellowish bill with black on the basal half and on the casque.The juveniles lack the casque, and <b>the</b> bare <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> eye is dull orange.|$|R

5|$|When {{examining}} the specimen, van Grouw {{noticed that the}} legs had at one point been detached and are now attached opposite their natural positions. The short feathering of the legs would therefore have been attached to the inner side of the upper tarsus in life, not the outer. The plate accompanying Forbes' 1898 article shows the feathers on the outer side, and depicts the legs as pinkish, whereas they are yellow in the skin. The spotted green pigeon has at times been described as having a knob {{at the base of}} its bill, {{similar to that of the}} Nicobar pigeon. This idea seems to have originated with Forbes, who had the bird depicted with this feature, perhaps due to his conviction that it was a species of Caloenas; it was depicted with a knob as late as 2002. This is despite the fact that the surviving specimen does not possess a knob, and Latham did not mention or depict this feature, so such depictions are probably incorrect. The artificial eyes of the specimen were removed when it was prepared into a study skin, but red paint around the right eye-socket suggests that it was originally intended to have red eyes. It is unknown whether this represents the natural eye colour of the bird, yet the eyes were also depicted as red in Latham's illustration, which does not appear to have been based on the existing specimen. Forbes had the iris depicted as orange and <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> the eye as green, though this was probably guesswork.|$|E

25|$|The {{juvenile}} {{is similar}} to the adult but has pale tips to the feathers of the wings, {{and the rest of the}} plumage is buff instead of pale grey. The bill is less massive and dirty pink in colour, and <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> the eye is not red.|$|E
25|$|Anal fistulae*, {{known as}} perianal fistulae in dogs, are {{most common in}} German Shepherd Dogs. They are {{characterized}} by draining tracts in <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> the anus. The cause is unknown. Surgical treatment is common, but recently use of cyclosporine in combination with ketoconazole {{has been shown to}} be effective.|$|E
50|$|The Karoo dwarf {{chameleon}} (Bradypodion karrooicum) is a chameleon {{native to}} South Africa. It is about 14 cm (6 in) long, mostly colored grey and brown, sometimes olive. <b>The</b> thin <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> throat is yellow, {{and it has}} conical scales along the spine.|$|R
50|$|This breed, {{like its}} {{ancestor}} the Bloodhound, has a hanging skin structure, which causes {{the face to}} occasionally look sad; this, for many people, adds to the breed's charm. The dewlap, seen as <b>the</b> loose, elastic <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> neck, and the trailing ears which along with the Bloodhound are the longest of any breed, help trap the scent {{of what they are}} tracking. Its neck is wider than its head. This, combined with <b>the</b> loose <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> its face and neck means that flat collars can easily be pulled off. The looseness of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> results in <b>the</b> Basset's characteristic facial wrinkles. The Basset's skull is characterised by its large dolichocephalic nose, which is second only to the Bloodhound in scenting ability and number of olfactory receptor cells.|$|R
50|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{radiation}} is implicated in cattle with no pigmentation around the eyelids and cattle with prominently placed eyes. Exudate from <b>the</b> sun-burnt <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> eyes can contain bacteria and attracts flies. UV light also directly damages the corneal epithelium, {{leading to a}} breakdown in host innate immunity.|$|R
25|$|Some {{types of}} {{hypercholesterolemia}} lead to specific physical findings. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (Type IIa hyperlipoproteinemia) {{may be associated}} with xanthelasma palpebrarum (yellowish patches underneath <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> the eyelids), arcus senilis (white or gray discoloration of the peripheral cornea), and xanthomata (deposition of yellowish cholesterol-rich material) of the tendons, especially of the fingers. Type III hyperlipidemia {{may be associated with}} xanthomata of the palms, knees and elbows.|$|E
25|$|Acetic acid ear drops {{may be used}} as a {{preventative}} measure. Treatment {{of acute}} cases is typically with antibiotic drops, such as ofloxacin or acetic acid. Steroid drops may be used in addition to antibiotics. Pain medications such as ibuprofen may be used for the pain. Antibiotics by mouth are not recommended unless the person has poor immune function or there is infection of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> the ear. Typically, improvement occurs within a day of the start of treatment. Treatment of chronic cases depends on the cause.|$|E
25|$|Recent work {{suggests}} the IL-23/IL-17 pathway {{plays a major}} role in the autoimmune disorder psoriasis. In this condition, immune cells react to inflammatory molecules released within <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> the joints and scalp. This response causes the epidermal cells to recycle more rapidly than usual, which leads to the formation of red, scaly lesions and chronic skin inflammation. Analysis of biopsies taken from lesions of psoriasis patients show an enrichment of cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils containing IL-17. This indicates an excessive infiltration of pro-inflammatory immune cells and IL-17 cytokines are associated with the development of psoriasis.|$|E
50|$|The {{fruit is}} not an {{important}} food on Socotra. The pithy tissue lying under <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> seeds of larger ripe fruits is the only part eaten. The seeds {{are said to be}} bitter, caustic and to cause sores on <b>the</b> tongue. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> of <b>the</b> unripe fruit is extremely sour.|$|R
50|$|The afflicted {{may have}} {{relatively}} {{small amounts of}} pain that will quickly increase in severity over a time period of 6-12 weeks. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> temperature <b>around</b> <b>the</b> bone may increase, a bony swelling may be evident, and movement may be restricted in adjacent joints.|$|R
5000|$|Cut {{the hair}} in the pastern area with {{scissors}} or clippers if necessary. Be careful not to break <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> when clipping <b>around</b> <b>the</b> affected area as to not irritate <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|R
25|$|Changes in {{secondary}} sex characteristics include every {{change that is}} {{not directly related to}} sexual reproduction. In males, these changes involve appearance of pubic, facial, and body hair, deepening of the voice, roughening of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> the upper arms and thighs, and increased development of the sweat glands. In females, secondary sex changes involve elevation of the breasts, widening of the hips, development of pubic and underarm hair, widening of the areolae, and elevation of the nipples. The changes {{in secondary}} sex characteristics that take place during puberty are often referred to in terms of five Tanner stages, named after the British pediatrician who devised the categorization system.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms can be {{directly}} or indirectly related {{to the loss of}} bowel control. The direct (primary) symptom is a lack of control over bowel contents which tends to worsen without treatment. Indirect (secondary) symptoms, which are the result of leakage, include pruritus ani (an intense itching sensation from the anus), perianal dermatitis (irritation and inflammation of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> the anus), and urinary tract infections. Due to embarrassment, people may only mention secondary symptoms rather than acknowledge incontinence. Any major underlying cause will produce additional signs and symptoms, such as protrusion of mucosa in external rectal prolapse. Symptoms of fecal leakage (FL) are similar, and may occur after defecation. There may be loss of small amounts of brown fluid and staining of the underwear.|$|E
25|$|The wing {{included}} three clawed fingers; however, unlike in some more primitive theropods, the longest two fingers were not separate, but were bound {{together by the}} skin and other tissue forming the wing, so Anchiornis was functionally two-fingered. These bound fingers were incorporated into a post-patagium, or flap of skin and other tissues that helped support the bases of the main wing feathers. Like the toes, <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> {{the bottom of the}} fingers was covered in tiny, rounded scales. Unlike the toes, the flesh around the underside of the finger bones was twice as thick as the bones themselves and lacked distinct pads; instead, the fingers were straight and smooth without any major creases at the joints. Scales and skin around the fingers is very rarely preserved in fossils of early pennaraptorans, the only notable exceptions being Anchiornis and Caudipteryx, which had similar thick, scaly fingers associated with its wings.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>skin</b> of 'Crimson Gold' has {{a yellow}} {{background}} which is visual {{only at the}} shaded areas of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> stem. Otherwise it {{is covered with a}} ruby red. Flesh is crisp, with a balance of sweet and tart. Delicious for fresh eating, and also good for baking, retains its shape and texture even with high temperature.|$|R
50|$|Friction {{blisters}} {{are caused}} by excess shear stress between the surface of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and <b>the</b> body. <b>The</b> strata of <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Stratum spinosum are most susceptible to shear. As the Stratum spinosum tears away from the connecting tissues below, plasma from the cells diffuses out. This plasma solution helps new cells divide and grow into new connective tissues and epidermal layers.|$|R
50|$|To {{have one}} of these {{implants}} installed, an incision is made down to the subcutaneous layer (subcutis) of <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> A dermal elevator, a widely used medical instrument, separates the subcutis and the fascia, creating the pocket in which the implant will be inserted. After the implant is placed, the incision is stitched shut. Surgical tape is often applied to minimize movement while <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> fuses <b>around</b> <b>the</b> implant.|$|R
25|$|One study {{compared}} {{patients with}} ingrown toenails to healthy controls {{and found no}} difference in the shape of toenails between those of patients and of the control group. The study suggested that treatment should not be based on the correction of a non-existent nail deformity. Ingrown toenails are caused by weight-bearing (activities such as walking, running, etc.) in patients that have too much soft skin tissue on the sides of their nail. Weight bearing causes this excessive amount of skin to bulge up along the sides of the nail. The pressure on <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> the nail results in the tissue being damaged, resulting in swelling, redness and infection. Many treatments are directed at the nail itself and often include partial or full removal of the healthy nail. However, failure to treat the cutaneous condition can result in a return of the ingrowth and a deformity or mutilation of the nail.|$|E
25|$|Seals at {{the wrists}} and neck prevent water {{entering}} the suit by a close contact fit against <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> the wrists and neck. The seals are not absolutely watertight, however, and the wearer may experience some seepage during use. The wearer will also get damp due to sweat and condensation. The seals are typically made from latex rubber or foam neoprene, {{but are also}} available in silicone rubber. Latex seals are supple but easily damaged and deteriorate with exposure to oils, oxygen, and other materials, so they must be replaced periodically, every two years or more often. Latex also causes an allergic reaction in some users. Neoprene seals last longer and are non-allergenic, but, being less elastic, let more water enter {{because they do not}} seal as effectively as latex seals to the contours of wrist and neck. They are also typically glued and sewn together to form a tube, and may leak along that seam.|$|E
500|$|An elephant's skin is {{generally}} very tough, at [...] thick {{on the back}} and parts of the head. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>around</b> the mouth, anus, and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants typically have grey skin, but African elephants look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud. Asian elephants have some patches of depigmentation, particularly on the forehead and ears and the areas around them. Calves have brownish or reddish hair, especially on the head and back. As elephants mature, their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense concentrations of hair and bristles remain {{on the end of the}} tail as well as the chin, genitals and the areas around the eyes and ear openings. Normally the skin of an Asian elephant is covered with more hair than its African counterpart.|$|E
50|$|The Inferior rectal nerves ({{inferior}} anal nerves, inferior hemorrhoidal nerve) usually branch {{from the}} pudendal nerve but occasionally arises {{directly from the}} sacral plexus; they cross the ischiorectal fossa along with the inferior hemorrhoidal vessels, toward the anal canal and {{the lower end of}} the rectum, and is distributed to the Sphincter ani externus (external anal sphincter, EAS) and to <b>the</b> integument (<b>skin)</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> anus.|$|R
50|$|During a {{physical}} examination, the doctor examines the unusual {{areas of the}} breast, especially the appearance of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> on and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> nipples and feeling for any lumps or areas of thickening.|$|R
30|$|How the gauze {{should be}} fixed in place {{is yet another}} topic for discussion. The Russian {{protocol}} suggests the use of bulky pressure dressings to restrict movement between <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and pins [37]. Paley [3] also recommends minimising pinâ€“skin motion by applying pressure to <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> either by using gauze compressed by rubber or by using foam sponge cubes pushed down using plastic clips. In a similar approach, Hoffmann [82] recommended relieving <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> tension <b>around</b> pins {{in order to prevent}} infection.|$|R
