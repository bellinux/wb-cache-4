500|$|The use {{of motion}} capture {{to control the}} {{position}} and orientation of a virtual camera enables the operator to intuitively move and aim the virtual camera by simply walking about and turning the virtual camera rig. [...] A virtual camera rig consists of a portable monitor or <b>tablet</b> <b>device,</b> motion sensors, optional support framework, and optional joystick or button controls that are commonly used to start or stop recording and adjust lens properties. [...] In 1992, Michael McKenna of MIT's Media Lab demonstrated the earliest documented virtual camera rig when he fixed a Polhemus magnetic motion sensor and a 3.2 inch portable LCD TV to a wooden ruler. [...] The Walkthrough Project at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill produced a number of physical input devices for virtual camera view control including dual three-axis joysticks and a billiard-ball shaped prop known as the UNC Eyeball that featured an embedded six-degree of freedom motion tracker and a digital button.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} {{gameplay}} modes {{that can be}} used with the Switch; [...] "TV Mode" [...] with the Console docked within the Dock to support play on a large television, [...] "Tabletop Mode" [...] with the Console placed on a table or other surface using its kickstand for shared gaming away from a dedicated screen, or in [...] "Handheld Mode" [...] as a standard portable <b>tablet</b> <b>device.</b> Users can switch between these modes simply by placing or removing the Console from the Dock, extending or retracting the kickstand, and detaching or connecting the Joy-Con. Games may be designed to play only in specific modes; for example, Voez, which relies on touch-screen controls, initially could not be played in TV Mode.|$|E

2500|$|The Start menu may be {{launched}} either by pressing [...] (the Windows key) on a keyboard or its equivalent on a <b>tablet</b> <b>device,</b> pressing CTRL+ESC on a keyboard, or by {{clicking on the}} visual Start button. With the exception of Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the Start button {{can be found on}} the taskbar. On versions before Windows Vista, the Start Button consisted of the word [...] "Start" [...] and the Windows Logo (the word [...] "Start" [...] was localized for each different language version of the system, for instance, reading Avvio in Italian). On the Windows Vista and Windows 7 desktop, the word [...] "Start" [...] has been replaced by a blue Windows [...] "orb" [...] logo. However, the user can revert to displaying the word [...] "Start" [...] and the Windows Logo by setting the theme to Windows Classic. The Start button on Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8 is initially moved from the traditional taskbar to [...] "charms", a hidden secondary taskbar located to the right of the screen (accessed by swiping in from the right on multitouch devices, or positioning the mouse in one of the right corners of the screen and sliding up or down). The Start screen is accessed either by that button or by clicking the lower left corner of the screen. Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 restore the button back to its original place without removing the new button in the charms.|$|E
