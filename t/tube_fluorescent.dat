When operated from DC, the starting switch is often arranged to reverse the polarity of the supply to the lamp each time it is started; otherwise, the mercury accumulates {{at one end of}} the <b>tube.</b> <b>Fluorescent</b> lamps are (almost) never operated {{directly from}} DC for those reasons.

40|$|Calibration curves {{for major}} and trace {{elements}} in standard rock samples were determined using an energy dispersive X-ray analyser. About 3 g of powdered rock samples was pressed at 6000 kg/cm 2 {{to prepare the}} pellet. Ti or Mo secondary target was excited by X-rays from a W X-ray <b>tube.</b> <b>Fluorescent</b> X-rays from the sample pellet were analysed using a Si(Li) semiconductor detector connected with a 1024 channel pulse height analyser. For major elements such as SiO 2, K 2 O, TiO 2 and Fe 2 O 3, matrix effect could be neglected and good calibration curves were obtained. For Rb and Sr, correction for matrix effect was inquired and this was easily done {{on the basis of}} Fe contents. For the samples in which Rb content was less than l 0 ppm and Fe 2 O 3 content was higher than 10 %, correction for sum peak effect due to Fe-Kα and Fe-Kβ X rays could not be neglected and the correction was made successfully...|$|E
40|$|A sterically undemanding azide {{analogue}} of dTTP (AHP dUTP) with an alkyl {{chain and}} ethynyl {{attachment to the}} nucleobase was designed and incorporated into DNA by primer extension, reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). An azide-modified 523 bp PCR amplicon with all 335 thymidines replaced by AHP dU was {{shown to be a}} perfect copy of the template from which it was amplified. Replacement of thymidine with AHP dU increases duplex stability, accounting in part for the high incorporation efficiency of the azide-modified triphosphate. Single-stranded azide-labelled DNA was conveniently prepared from PCR products by λ-exonuclease digestion and streptavidin magnetic bead isolation. Efficient fluorescent labelling of single and double-stranded DNA was carried out using dyes functionalized with bicyclo[6. 1. 0]non- 4 -yne (BCN) via the strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition (SPAAC) reaction. This revealed that the degree of labelling must be carefully controlled to achieve optimum fluorescence and avoid fluorescence quenching. Dual-coloured probes were obtained in a single <b>tube</b> <b>fluorescent</b> labelling reaction; and varying the ratios of the two dyes provides a simple method to prepare DNA probes with unique fluorescent signatures. AHP dUTP is a versatile clickable nucleotide with potentially wide applications in biology and nanotechnology including single molecule studies and synthesis of modified aptamer libraries via SELEX...|$|E

40|$|On the sea off {{southern}} Kyushu, fluorescent fish-attracting lamps {{are coming}} {{to be used in}} square net (Hachida-ami) fishing. The <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> of various colours (green, day-light, cobalt, blue, yellow and red) were specially made for this investigation. By means of a very sensitive photo-meter with 5 kinds of filters, the lumens of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> were measured respectively and their distributions in various wave-lengths were determined approximately. The coloured <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> were proved to be highly effective. Even 100 -watt fluorescence tubes were measured in high lumen. For example, the green 100 -watt <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> was equivalent to 300 - 400 watt of incandescent lamps in photo-energy output. The bluish or greenish coloured <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> have more quantities of photoenergy than incandescent lamps in the range of long wave-length, and, on the other hand, the latters have more quantities of energy than the former in short wave-length. By the reason that fish may be found of bluish light, we can anticipate that these color-lamps will be highly effective in attracting of fish. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of various commercial lamps and residual oxygen on discoloration and oxidation of cured boiled sausage. The wavelength dependence of different spectral bands on sausage color and oxygen absorption was investigated. A model packaging system, simulating a gastight package was used to compare the influence of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes,</b> metal halide lamps, color optimized <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> and LEDs. Sausages exposed to daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> showed significantly (p < 0. 005) higher rates of oxygen absorption and discoloration in comparison to metal halide lamps and color optimized <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> for meat products after 24 h of storage time at 6 ± 1 °C. To investigate the effect of light and residual oxygen in the headspace of the packaging, oxygen concentrations of 0. 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 2. 0 % were tested with daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> in regard of oxygen absorption and discoloration of the sausages. Higher residual oxygen concentrations showed higher discoloration and also higher rates of oxygen absorption of the sausage. Low initial oxygen contents in the headspace of packaged sausage in conjunction with optimized illumination can prolong the shelf life of cured sausages in retail shelves...|$|R
