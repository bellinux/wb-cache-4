5|$|In Proto-Indo-European religion, <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>was</b> personified as {{the male}} god *Meh1not. The ancient Sumerians {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>was</b> the god Nanna, {{who was the}} father of Inanna, the goddess of the planet Venus, and Utu, the god of the sun. Nanna was later known as Sîn, and was particularly associated with magic and sorcery. In Greco-Roman mythology, the Sun and the Moon are represented as male and female, respectively (Helios/Sol and Selene/Luna); this is a development unique to the eastern Mediterranean and traces of an earlier male moon god in the Greek tradition are preserved in the figure of Menelaus.|$|E
5000|$|In the Northern Hemisphere, if {{the left}} side of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> dark then <b>the</b> light part <b>is</b> growing, and <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> {{referred}} to as [...] (moving toward a full <b>moon).</b> If <b>the</b> right side of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> dark then <b>the</b> light part <b>is</b> shrinking, and <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> referred to as waning (past full and moving toward a new <b>moon).</b> Assuming that <b>the</b> viewer is in the northern hemisphere, the right portion of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> part that is always growing (i.e., if the right side <b>is</b> dark, <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> growing darker; if the right side <b>is</b> lit, <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> growing lighter).|$|R

25|$|The Moon's {{elongation}} is its {{angular distance}} {{east of the}} Sun at any time. At new <b>moon,</b> it <b>is</b> zero and <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> {{said to be in}} conjunction. At full <b>moon,</b> <b>the</b> elongation <b>is</b> 180° and it is said to be in opposition. In both cases, <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> in syzygy, that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> Sun, <b>Moon</b> and Earth <b>are</b> nearly aligned. When elongation is either 90° or 270°, <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> said to be in quadrature.|$|R

5|$|A Trip to <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> {{met with}} {{especially}} large enthusiasm in the United States, where (to Méliès's chagrin) its piracy by Lubin, Selig, Edison and others gave it wide distribution. Exhibitors in New York City, Washington D.C., Cleveland, Detroit, New Orleans, and Kansas City {{reported on the}} film's great success in their theaters. The film also did well in other countries, including Germany, Canada, and Italy, where it was featured as a headline attraction through 1904.|$|E
5|$|A Trip to <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> {{named one}} of the 100 {{greatest}} films of the 20th century by The Village Voice, ranked 84th. The film remains the best-known of the hundreds of films made by Méliès, and the moment in which the capsule lands in the Moon's eye {{remains one of the most}} iconic and frequently referenced images in the history of cinema. It is widely regarded as the earliest example of the science fiction film genre and, more generally, as one of the most influential films in cinema history.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, the {{animation}} company Belvision Studios produced {{a string of}} colour adaptations based on Hergé's original comics, adapting eight of the Adventures {{into a series of}} daily five-minute episodes.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> Earth's largest natural {{satellite}} and the nearest major celestial object.

40|$|The aseismicity of <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> has <b>been</b> {{interpreted}} by Latham et al. (1970) {{as an indication}} that <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> relatively cold in the interior. An alternative argument is now presented. This argument suggests the reverse conclusion, that <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> too warm to be seismic. The argument is based on known properties of materials, in particular their modes of failure under shear stress. A tentative conclusion <b>is</b> presented that <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> largely aseismic because the lunar-therm lies in the stable-sliding field of rock failure. It is too warm, rather than too cold...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> {{taken to}} be Ahmad because in every verse above where <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> signified, <b>the</b> word Qamar is used and that word {{distinctly}} means Full Moon (see: 'Moon of the Prophets' below).|$|R
5|$|The Inca {{followed}} both {{solar and}} lunar cycles throughout the year.

Important festivals such as Quyllurit'i, {{perhaps the most important}} festival given its significance and meaning, are still celebrated on the full moon.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} {{to perform a}} successful lunar soft landing was Luna 9 and the first unstaffed vehicle to orbit <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> Luna 10, both in 1966. Rock and soil samples were brought back to Earth by three Luna sample return missions (Luna 16 in 1970, Luna 20 in 1972, and Luna 24 in 1976), which returned 0.3kg total.

50|$|Unlike other {{satellites}} of {{the solar}} system, the solar attraction on <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> more than that of its primary. According to Asimov, <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> a planet moving around the Sun in careful step with the Earth.|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{history the}} story of the {{werewolf}} has been iconic and represented by <b>the</b> full <b>moon.</b> When <b>the</b> phase of <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> full, typically normal people grow fangs and hair similar to a dog. Thus the symbol of <b>the</b> full <b>moon</b> has <b>been</b> associated with insanity. In most stories <b>the</b> full <b>moon</b> means that people turn into monsters that roam around and instill terror in people. This symbol {{has been a part of}} society for a long time and can even be seen in older works, not just modern ones. Because of this association of being crazy the term lunatic was coined, meaning “affected with the kind of insanity that was supposed to have recurring periods dependent on the changes of the moon” (OED). In Frankenstein by Mary Shelley <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> used to help make the creature into a monster. The creature’s violence increases whenever <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> out, and this violence leads to Victor’s downfall. Whenever the creature does something evil <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> described depicting <b>the</b> insanity that is slowly consuming Victor. There is the relationship of <b>the</b> <b>moon,</b> which affects <b>the</b> monster who then affects Victor, so <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> indirectly causing Victor to be consumed by insanity. There is a close association of Victor and <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> because nature <b>is</b> showing the violence of something unnatural like <b>the</b> monster. <b>The</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> showing Victor <b>the</b> unnatural horror of the creature he has created as his punishment for being the creator. The notorious symbol of <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> illustrating insanity <b>is</b> used throughout the novel to show how the creature is slowly making Victor insane and <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> very much demotic in character because it reveals the creature to Victor.

5|$|Unlike the two {{previous}} Transformers installments, which were {{based solely on the}} script writers' endemic story, Transformers: Dark of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> based on a novel called , written by Alan Dean Foster. The novel is a prequel to the 2007 film Transformers. It follows the same story structure as Dark of the Moon, being set in 1969, the year of Apollo 11. The story structure differs slightly, though, because the novel was written merely as prequel to the first film.|$|E
5|$|According to Méliès's recollections, much of {{the unusual}} cost of A Trip to <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> due to the {{mechanically}} operated scenery and the Selenite costumes in particular, which were made for the film using cardboard and canvas. Méliès himself sculpted prototypes for the heads, feet, and kneecap pieces in terra cotta, and then created plaster molds for them. A specialist in mask-making used these molds to produce cardboard versions for the actors to wear. One of the backdrops for the film, showing {{the inside of the}} glass-roofed workshop in which the space capsule is built, was painted to look like the actual glass-roofed studio in which the film was made.|$|E
50|$|Earthshine is most readily {{observable}} from {{shortly before}} until shortly {{after a new}} <b>moon,</b> during <b>the</b> waxing or waning crescent phase. When <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> new as viewed from Earth, Earth is nearly fully lit up as viewed from <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b> Sunlight <b>is</b> reflected from the Earth to the night side of <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b> <b>The</b> night side appears to glow faintly and the entire orb of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> dimly visible.|$|R
50|$|Astrologically speaking, <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> {{associated}} with a person's emotional make-up, unconscious habits, rhythms, memories, moods {{and their ability to}} react and adapt to those around them. It is also {{associated with}} the mother, maternal instincts or the urge to nurture, the home, the need for security and the past, especially early experiences and childhood. The 1st-century poet Manilius described <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> or Luna, as melancholic. In medicine, <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> associated with <b>the</b> digestive system, stomach, breasts, the ovaries and menstruation (which does occur on a monthly cycle) and the pancreas. Despite Manilius's assignation, <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> commonly associated with the phlegmatic humor; it ruled the animal spirits.

5|$|After 1805, the {{exploits}} of 40,000French, Russian, and Austrian soldiers excited the European imagination. General Schmitt's grave has never been found, but in 1811 a monument for him was erected at the Stein Tor, the gate leading from the old village of Krems to the hamlet of Stein. The house in which Captain von Stiebar lived was marked with a bronze plate commemorating his contribution to the battle. In 1840, a Spanish lithographer created {{an image of the}} battle, which was later expanded by English lithographer John Outhwaite. The image depicts the evacuation of French troops via the Danube flotilla (see Infobox image) on a moonlit night. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>was</b> in its last quarter phase 48hours later, and on 11 November probably did not provide as much light as depicted in the image.|$|E
5|$|After Méliès's {{financial}} difficulties and decline, most {{copies of his}} prints were lost. In 1917, his offices were occupied by the French military, who melted down many of Méliès's films to gather the traces of silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the celluloid. When the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was demolished in 1923, the prints kept there were sold by weight to a vendor of second-hand film. Finally, in that same year, Méliès had a moment of anger and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil. In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the Gare Montparnasse in Paris. A Trip to <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> largely forgotten to history and went unseen for years.|$|E
5|$|Developed in part {{through the}} {{suggestions}} of Hergé's friends Bernard Heuvelmans and Jacques Van Melkebeke, Explorers on <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> produced following Hergé's extensive research into the possibility of human space travel– a feat that {{had yet to be}} achieved– with the cartoonist seeking for the work to be as realistic as possible. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with The Calculus Affair, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Critics have praised the illustrative detail of the book, but have expressed mixed views of the story. The volume was adapted for both the 1957 Belvision animated series, Hergé's Adventures of Tintin, and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E
50|$|Vaidyanatha Dikshita in his Jataka Parijata (Ch.III Sloka 48-55) {{tells us}} that if <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> in a sign owned by a benefic planet or is in vargas owned by Jupiter a {{legitimate}} child is born but not when - a) the 12th house is aspected by the Sun or b) if the Sun and <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>are</b> in a varga of the Sun or <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> or c) if Jupiter does not aspect the lagna or <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> or d) Jupiter neither occupies the lagna nor conjoins with <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> or e) if the lagna or <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> not in Jupiter’s vargas which are actually words advising exercise of caution in handling yogas indicating birth of an illegitimate child. In his notes to Sloka V.6 of Brihat Jataka, the commentator, N. Chidambaram Iyer, has also cited Yavaneswara who states that if the lagna-navamsa or the navamsa occupied by <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> owned by Jupiter the child will not be illegitimate. And, that according to Garga the child will not be illegitimate if a) <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> in Sagittarius or Pisces or b) if <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> in conjunction with Jupiter in any other sign or c) if <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> in a drekkena or navamsa of Jupiter. If a Parajāta yoga is found to occur {{and at the same}} time any one of the condition mentioned by Garga, Yavaneswara and Vaidyanatha indicating legitimate birth is also met then that particular birth will not be of an illegitimate child.|$|R
