Northbound trains change from third rail to overhead power here - any trains which cannot do so due to a fault can terminate here and use the adjacent sidings at Smithfield; southbound trains change to third rail power at nearby Farringdon Station but can run into the southbound platform at City Thameslink on AC power if an on-train fault results in the DC collector equipment being faulty - trains can then return north from the southbound platform at City Thameslink back towards Farringdon.|$|E
50|$|There were no fixed signals, and <b>trains</b> were <b>despatched</b> {{under the}} time {{interval}} system. {{the absence of}} telegraph communication, collisions were intended to be avoided by holding trains back until a specified time interval had elapsed since {{the departure of the}} previous train.|$|R
50|$|Around 1900, {{electromechanical}} signalling {{and safety}} equipment was introduced. It has two essential controls. First is the lever frame at its base. This houses the levers used {{to change the}} positions of the points and signals. Second, and above the lever frame, are the indicator panels. These hold the electric block repeaters that maintain communication with the main control frame in the stationmaster's office, from which route orders for <b>trains</b> are <b>despatched.</b> The stationmaster's and the signalmen's apparatus is interlocked to ensure that mistakes cannot occur.|$|R
50|$|It {{required}} that, if a {{train was}} brought to a stand at a signal, within three minutes in clear weather or immediately in rain, snow, or fog, {{the driver of the}} <b>train</b> must <b>despatch</b> his fireman, guard, or any shunter riding on the train, to the signal box to ensure that the signalman was aware of the presence of the train, and that all safeguards to protect it, such as slides or collars on the signal levers, were in place, the crewman then signing the train register to confirm this.|$|R
50|$|The U-754 {{was built}} in the Kriegsmarinewerft at the main fleet base of Wilhelmshaven in Northern Germany on the North Sea. She was {{completed}} on 28 August 1941, and given to the experienced Kapitänleutnant Johannes Ostermann to command. Following her work-up period in which the boat was tested and the crew <b>trained,</b> she was <b>despatched</b> on her first patrol.|$|R
50|$|Epsom races {{were held}} in {{the second week of}} operation, and the Company advertised the {{intention}} of running eight trains to Kingston on Derby Day. That morninga crowd of about 5,000 persons was found at the station gates. Several <b>trains</b> were <b>despatched</b> but still the throng increased, till at length the doors were carried off their hinges, and amid the shrieks of the female portion of their number, the mob broke over the booking counter, leaped through the windows, invaded the platform and rushed pell mell into a train chartered by a private party. Finding resistance useless, the officials sent for the Metropolitan Police, and at twelve o'clock a notice was posted on the booking office window announcing that no more trains would run that day.|$|R
25|$|The 3/7th Battalion {{was formed}} in April 1915 {{under the command of}} Lt-Col Sir Pieter C. van B. Stewart-Bam, a South African soldier and {{politician}} who had been in charge of the London Recruiting District for the TF. The role of the 3/7th was to <b>train</b> and <b>despatch</b> drafts to replace casualties in the 1/7th and 2/7th (and later other units) serving overseas. Stewart-Bam used his connections to arrange with the Dominion High Commissioners in London for the battalion to act as a training unit for officer cadets from the Dominions and Colonies. During the war there were often 70 officers training with the Reserve Bn, at one time 37 were from South Africa alone. The battalion sent some drafts to the King's African Rifles serving in the East African Campaign.|$|R
25|$|I am {{of opinion}} {{that the system is}} {{applicable}} with certainty and efficiency to the Cornwall Railway. That a sufficient power may be obtained so as to work the trains, which I think your traffic will require, at an average speed of 30 miles an hour for passenger trains, and from 15 to 20 miles an hour for goods, including stoppages in both cases, and that special <b>trains</b> may be <b>despatched</b> at greater speed if necessary.|$|R
6000|$|... "Craving your pardon, gracious lady," [...] {{said the}} architect, [...] "that blame rests with him who provokes the war. See, lord baron, there {{is time to}} send to Ulm, where the two guilds, our allies, will at once equip their <b>trained</b> bands and <b>despatch</b> them. We {{meanwhile}} will hold the knaves in check, and, by the time our burghers come up, the snake brood will have had such a lesson as they will not soon forget. Said I well, Herr Freiherr?" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{units at}} Watchfield in the 1950s {{included}} 47 Company RASC, and an air <b>despatch</b> <b>training</b> unit. In 1960 1 Army Air Support Organisation (1 AASO) was formed with HQ at Watchfield, and 47 Company and 22 Company joined it. Also at Arnhem Camp in the 1950s was 2nd Air Maintenance Company RAOC {{which became the}} 2nd Airborne Company RAOC. On 16 December 1961 16 Parachute Heavy Drop Company of the RAOC was formed, and Watchfield remained their base until 1971.|$|R
60|$|Going to Hurstley now {{was not so}} {{formidable}} {{an affair}} {{as it was in}} Endymion's boyhood. Then the journey occupied a whole and wearisome day. Little Hurstley had become a busy station of the great Slap-Bang railway, and a <b>despatch</b> <b>train</b> landed you at the bustling and flourishing hostelry, our old and humble friend, the Horse Shoe, within the two hours. It was a rate that satisfied even Thornberry, and almost reconciled him to the too frequent presence of his wife and family at Hurstley, a place to which Mrs. Thornberry had, it would seem, become passionately attached.|$|R
50|$|After having {{completed}} her <b>training,</b> she was <b>despatched</b> to Guwahati. She {{was told to}} lead a normal life to deflect any suspicion even as she carried out the attacks. She even reportedly purchased a plot and constructed {{a house on the}} outskirts of Guwahati. ‘‘Unlike the other ULFA cadre, she travelled by public transport and did not carry any cellphone or call up the leadership from Guwahati after she was sent out on these missions. Her most potent weapon was her complete anonymity and secrecy,’’ IGP Khagen Sharma said. She reportedly travelled with two-inch-long mortars in city buses.|$|R
60|$|On the war {{breaking}} {{out the first}} thought {{of the leaders in}} Rhodesia was to save as much of the line which was their connection through Mafeking with the south as was possible. For this purpose an armoured <b>train</b> was <b>despatched</b> only three days after the expiration of the ultimatum to the point four hundred miles south of Bulawayo, where the frontiers of the Transvaal and of Bechuanaland join. Colonel Holdsworth commanded the small British force. The Boers, a thousand or so in number, had descended upon the railway, and an action followed in which the train appears to have had better luck than has usually attended these ill-fated contrivances. The Boer commando was driven back and a number were killed. It was probably news of this affair, and not anything which had occurred at Mafeking, which caused those rumours of gloom at Pretoria very shortly after the outbreak of hostilities. An agency telegraphed that women were weeping in the streets of the Boer capital. We had not then realised how soon and how often we should see the same sight in Pall Mall.|$|R
50|$|The account recalls an {{instance}} when, a train of 99 wagons having been made up at Bilson, {{the yard was}} vainly searched for one more, and the guard had to leave with only ‘99 on’, to his great disappointment. This gross overloading led to an event {{in the autumn of}} 1863, when a train of 70 wagons broke in two near Shakemantle. On discovering the shortage, the driver stopped below Shakemantle siding, whereupon the 30 truant wagons ran into the train, creating a confusion of wreckage which took five days to clear. It also led to the limiting of trains to 45 wagons and the employment of a third locomotive, so that four trains a day could be worked down. Traffic continued to increase, and on most days a wire had to be sent to Gloucester for two special engines to clear Bullo yard. Occasionally, a train would take wagons to Grange Court, the guard riding on the last truck carrying a red flag and a supply of detonators. Later, broad-gauge <b>trains</b> were <b>despatched</b> in the evening to Salisbury via Swindon, avoiding the wait through the night at Bullo.|$|R
50|$|A {{goods train}} had left Toowoomba {{on the night}} of 29 January 1913, and had derailed near the Murphys Creek railway station on the Main line, about one mile from the station yard limits, on the range side near the 84-mile (139 km) mark. No members of the crew were injured, but a {{considerable}} amount of damage was caused to the goods vehicles and the track. A breakdown gang was sent from Toowoomba and breakdown <b>trains</b> were also <b>despatched</b> from Brisbane and Toowoomba to clear wreckage from the line. The spot where the derailment had taken place was in a relatively inaccessible area and workers had to prise the wreckage apart. Several trips were made by breakdown trains to the derailment site.|$|R
60|$|But, {{now that}} it was too late, the Boers {{suddenly}} took the initiative, and in dramatic fashion. North of Estcourt, where General Hildyard was being daily reinforced from the sea, there are two small townlets, or at least geographical (and railway) points. Frere is about ten miles north of Estcourt, and Chieveley is five miles north of that and about as far to the south of Colenso. On November 15th an armoured <b>train</b> was <b>despatched</b> from Estcourt {{to see what was going}} on up the line. Already one disaster had befallen us in this campaign on account of these clumsy contrivances, and a heavier one was now to confirm the opinion that, acting alone, they are totally inadmissible. As a means of carrying artillery for a force operating upon either flank of them, with an assured retreat behind, there may be a place for them in modern war, but as a method of scouting they appear to be the most inefficient and also the most expensive that has ever been invented. An intelligent horseman would gather more information, be less visible, and retain some freedom as to route. After our experience the armoured train may steam out of military history.|$|R
5000|$|Bond {{was born}} in Sutton Coldfield in 1938. He competed in cycle {{speedway}} for Sutton Coldfield Stars before taking up the motorized form. He undertook his national service in 1960, joining the Royal Corps of Signals and <b>training</b> as a <b>despatch</b> rider before joining the Royal Signals Motorcycle Display Team, performing around the UK and at Madison Square Gardens. He first rode in speedway as a junior in 1961, moving into the Wolverhampton Wolves team in 1963, the year that the Wolves won the Provincial League. Nicknamed [...] "007" [...] in reference to his fictional namesake, he was a regular member of the Wolves team until 1971 {{when he moved to}} the Swindon Robins. After two seasons with the Robins, he spent a season with the Long Eaton Archers before retiring at the end of 1974.|$|R
25|$|The Staff and Ticket safeworking {{system was}} {{used on the}} line, but with no tickets to be issued {{due to the lack}} of {{crossing}} places or signalling staff at the terminus. Staff locked points were provided at the main line junction. In 1953 the main line was using the Electric Staff safeworking system, so a special procedure was required. A freight <b>train</b> would be <b>despatched</b> from Heidelberg with a 'Heidelberg to Macleod' electric staff. The train then proceeded to the junction, where it would be met by the signalman from Macleod carrying the 'Macleod to Mont Park' train staff. The staffs would be exchanged, the 'Heidelberg to Macleod' staff used to unlock the points so they could be set for the diverge, and the train allowed to proceed to Mont Park with the 'Macleod to Mont Park' staff. The signalman then reset the points to the main line, and returned the 'Heidelberg to Macleod' Electric staff to the Electric staff instrument to allow another train to use the main line. On the return from Mont Park the reverse procedure was carried out.|$|R
50|$|The {{guard of}} the parcels train had been {{travelling}} {{in the rear}} cab of the locomotive. He was thrown from his seat {{by the force of}} the collision but was not injured. He walked towards Paddock Wood and was met by the guard of the passenger train. They agreed between themselves that the guard of the passenger train would protect the line {{to the rear of the}} accident site and that the guard of the parcels train would go forward to Marden station where he could summon help by telephone from an electricity substation there. The call was made at 20:58 hrs. It was then confirmed that the electricity supply was off. The guard of the passenger train reported the accident to Ashford signalbox from signal A370. This call was made at about 20:45. The signalman at Tonbridge stopped an up passenger train at Headcorn and held it there. Agreement was made with Ashford signalbox that no further <b>trains</b> would be <b>despatched</b> from Ashford towards Tonbridge. The Ashford steam crane was used to clear the wreckage.|$|R

6000|$|Just before little Gertie {{reached the}} station, Sam {{happened}} {{to be engaged in}} attempting to take his dinner. We use the word attempting advisedly, because our signalman had not the ghost of a chance to sit down, as ordinary mortals do, and take his dinner with any degree of certainty. He took it as it were, disjointedly in the midst of alarms. That the reader may understand why, we must observe that the [...] "block system" [...] of signalling, which had recently been introduced on part of the line, necessitated constant attention, and a series of acts, which gave the signalman no rest, during certain periods of his watch, for more than two minutes at a time, if so long. The block system is the method of protecting trains by [...] "blocking" [...] the line; that is, forbidding the advance of trains until the line is clear, thus securing an interval of space between trains, instead of the older and more common method of an interval of time. The chief objection to the latter system is this, that one accident is apt to cause another. Suppose a <b>train</b> <b>despatched</b> from a station; an interval of say quarter of an hour allowed and then another sent off. If the first train should break down, there is some chance of the second train overtaking and running into it. With the block system this is impossible. For instance, a train starts from any station, say A, and has to run past stations B and C. The instant it starts the signalman at A rings a telegraph bell to attract B's attention, {{at the same time he}} indicates on another telegraphic instrument [...] "Train on line," [...] locks his instruments in that position, and puts up the [...] "stop" [...] signal, or, blocks the line. B replies, acknowledging the signal, and telegraphs to C to be ready. The moment the train passes B's station, he telegraphs to C, [...] "Train on line," [...] and blocks that part of the line with the semaphore, [...] "Stop", as A had done, he also telegraphs back to A, [...] "Line clear," [...] whereupon A lets a second train on, if one is ready. Very soon C sends [...] "Line clear" [...] to B, whereupon B is prepared to let on that second train, when it comes up, and so on ad infinitum. The signals, right and left are invariably repeated, so that there is no chance of mistake though the failure of the telegraph instruments, because if any of these should fail, the want of a reply would at once induce a telegram through the [...] "speaking" [...] instrument with which each station is furnished, and which is similar to the telegraph instruments used at most railway stations, and the line would remain [...] "blocked" [...] until a satisfactory answer set it free. The working of the semaphore signals, which are familiar to most people as tall posts with projecting moveable arms, is accomplished by the mechanical action of the [...] "levers" [...] before mentioned. There are two [...] "distant" [...] signals and one [...] "home" [...] signal to be worked by each man. Besides these there are levers for working the various [...] "points" [...] around the station which lead to sidings, and when these levers are in action, i.e. placed for the shunting of a goods train, they self-lock the levers that [...] "block" [...] the line, so that while this operation of shunting (which just means shoving a train to one side out of the way) is going on, the signalman could not make the mistake of letting a train pass the distant signal--the thing is rendered impossible.|$|R
50|$|He was promoted, in due course, lieutenant-general in 1760, {{and general}} in 1777. On the {{outbreak}} of the Gordon riots, says the Gentleman's Magazine, the rioters meant to burn the Warren. 'But General Belford had made such dispositions that 40,000 men could not have forced the arsenal. This important service, and the <b>despatching</b> <b>trains</b> of artillery to the different camps, kept him on horseback day and night. Such extraordinary fatigue, such unremitting application, burst a blood-vessel, and brought on a fever, which carried him off in a few days' (Gentleman's Magazine, vol. 1., 1780, p. 347). General Belford died at the Warren, Woolwich, on 1 July 1780, and was succeeded in his command by his eldest son, who was also an officer in the artillery. Belford {{seems to have been a}} very competent officer, and to have greatly contributed to the high position since taken by the royal regiment; he contributed a curious little pamphlet, 'Colonel Belford's March of the Artillery,' to Muller's 'Treatise on the War in Flanders,' published in 1757, and he was the first officer to introduce the fife into the English army by bringing over a Hanoverian fifer, named Johann Ulrich, in 1748, who taught the fifers of the royal artillery.|$|R
50|$|When the Great War {{began in}} 1914, Colonel Sam Hughes, Canada's Minister of Militia, {{scrapped}} the original national mobilisation plan {{and asked the}} commanding officers of Militia units for volunteers to serve with battalions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF). Consequently, {{many members of the}} 13th Royal Regiment went overseas with the 4th Battalion, CEF, part of the famous First Contingent. Throughout the war, the unit served as a depot regiment that enrolled and <b>trained</b> men before <b>despatching</b> them to deploying CEF battalions. The CEF was not the only destination, either; the Royal Flying Corps accepted 82 men from the 13th, and 81 went to the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve. Locally raised CEF battalions that received soldiers from the 13th included the 19th Battalion, CEF (145 men), 36th Battalion, CEF (124 men), 76th Battalion, CEF (506 men), 86th (Machine Gun) Battalion, CEF (600 men), 120th (City of Hamilton) Battalion, CEF (625 men) and the 205th (Tiger) Battalion, CEF (704 men). Of these, the 120th (City of Hamilton) Battalion CEF had the closest affiliation with the 13th Royal Regiment, so on 28 May 1916, that battalion formally accepted the regiment's colours and took them overseas. The colours were laid up in Westminster Abbey until 5 March 1919, when the Dean of Westminster returned them to veterans of the 120th (City of Hamilton) Battalion, which was broken up to reinforce other CEF battalions in 1917.|$|R
