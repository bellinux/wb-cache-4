Shortly after the tow had been regained, the main engines of Aiviq failed and the vessel lost propulsion power in [...] seas. In the following morning, power was successfully restored on one of the four main engines and the vessel was able to hold position in the heavy weather. United States Coast Guard cutter USCGC Alex Haley was dispatched to the scene to monitor the situation.

50|$|Oil {{and natural}} gas {{drilling}} rigs are used not only to identify geologic reservoirs but also to create holes that allow the extraction of oil or natural gas from those reservoirs. Primarily in onshore oil and gas fields once a well has been drilled, <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>rig</b> will be moved off of the well and a service rig (a smaller rig) that is purpose-built for completions will be {{moved on to the}} well to get the well on line. This frees up <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>rig</b> to drill another hole and streamlines the operation as well as allowing for specialization of certain services, i.e., completions vs. drilling.|$|E

40|$|Water well drillers {{are exposed}} {{to high levels of}} noise while working. NIOSH {{researchers}} have found that water well drillers {{are exposed to}} levels above 85 dB (A) while performing certain tasks during a typical drilling job. Noise levels consistently over 85 dB (A) during an 8 -hour work shift are hazardous and can lead to hearing loss in workers. Finding ways to reduce noise exposure is difficult because of many factors. The work environment is constantly changing due to the location of jobs and environmental factors. <b>The</b> types of <b>drill</b> <b>rigs</b> required for <b>drilling</b> are expensive. Equipment can range from new to used (10 to 30 + years old). Drillers and owners can work together to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, and measures can be taken to reduce exposure to hazardous noise. [] Preventing hearing loss occurs through three stages. The first stage is removing noise from the source (i. e., <b>drill</b> <b>rig).</b> Various parts of a <b>drill</b> <b>rig</b> create noise besides <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> rod. NIOSH researchers have examined noise levels of <b>drill</b> <b>rigs.</b> Some of <b>the</b> loudest parts of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> <b>rig</b> include <b>the</b> compressor, engine, and cooling fan (Fig. 1).
