30|$|Relay-based {{transmission}} can over the benefits {{in terms of}} coverage extension as well as throughput improvement if compared to conventional direct transmission. In a relay enhanced cellular (REC) network, where multiple mobile terminals act as relaying nodes (RNs), multiuser diversity gain can be exploited. We propose an efficient relaying scheme, referred to as Broadcast Reserved Opportunity Assisted Diversity (<b>BROAD)</b> for <b>the</b> REC networks. Unlike the conventional Induced Multiuser Diversity Relaying (IMDR) scheme, our scheme acquires channel quality information (CQI) in which the destined node (DN) sends pilots on a reserved radio resource. <b>The</b> <b>BROAD</b> <b>scheme</b> can significantly decrease the signaling overhead among the mobile RNs while achieving the same multiuser diversity as the conventional IMDR scheme. In addition, an alternative version of <b>the</b> <b>BROAD</b> <b>scheme,</b> named as A-BROAD scheme, is proposed also, in which the candidate RN(s) feed back partial or full CQI to the base station (BS) for further scheduling purpose.

50|$|Despite early {{focus in}} the {{literature}} on RNA interference (RNAi) as a core mechanism which occurs at the level of messenger RNA translation, others have since been identified in the broader family of conserved RNA silencing pathways acting at the DNA and chromatin level. RNA silencing refers to the silencing activity of a range of small RNAs and is generally regarded as a broader category than RNAi. While the terms have sometimes been used interchangeably in the literature, RNAi is generally regarded as a branch of RNA silencing. To the extent it is useful to craft a distinction between these related concepts, RNA silencing may be thought of as referring to <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> <b>scheme</b> of small RNA related controls involved in gene expression and the protection of the genome against mobile repetitive DNA sequences, retroelements, and transposons to the extent that these can induce mutations. The molecular mechanisms for RNA silencing were initially studied in plants but have since broadened to cover a variety of subjects, from fungi to mammals, providing strong evidence that these pathways are highly conserved.|$|E

However, if one considers the influence of heritable enzymatic traits in <b>the</b> <b>broad</b> <b>scheme</b> of mammalian metabolism as it is emerging in present research, {{there can be no}} doubt of the role that genetics play in influencing the pattern of human steroid metab-olism. Steroids are peculiar compounds related in structure to choles-terol, and quite closely related chemically to each other. The pro-found differences in their pharmacologic properties reveal a subtlety of structure-function relationship which has not yet been entirely explored. The androgens, estrogens, progesterone, cortisol and aldo-sterone, all are synthesized in highly specialized endocrine tissues that, in contrast to the other tissues of the body, not only synthesize cholesterol but transform it further, by a rather well-delineated series of transformations into one or the other of these steroid hor-mones. Studies in human endocrinology have revealed that certain critical quantities of each hormone are required by the body for the regula-tion and maintenance of its vital functions: androgen for develop-ment and maintenance of male characteristics, estrogen and proges-terone in the menstrual cycle and in pregnancy, hydrocortisone for general metabolism and for meeting the demands of stress, aldo-sterone for salt and water balance. The actual amounts of hormones required daily for these individual processes must vary only within rather narrow limits...|$|R

5000|$|Through {{his work}} on the [...] "Bavaria Project", Broszat formed the concept of Resistenz (immunity), which is not to be {{confused}} with resistance (in German Widerstand). Resistenz referred to the ability of institutions such as the Wehrmacht, the Roman Catholic Church and the bureaucracy to enjoy [...] "immunity" [...] from the Nazi claims to total power and to function according to their traditional values, without seeking to challenge the Nazi regime's political monopoly. Broszat used the Resistenz concept to advance the view that at the local level, there was much continuity in Germany between the Weimar Era and the Nazi era. Broszat argued that there were two approaches to the Widerstand question, namely the [...] "behavioral" [...] approach that focused on intent and the [...] "functional" [...] approach that focused on the effect (Wirkung) on one's actions. For Broszat, the concept of Resistenz was meant to explain how much of the German population was able to evade the Nazi [...] "claim to total power" [...] without seeking to fundamentally challenge the regime. The Resistenz concept proved to be controversial, with Swiss historian Walter Hofer stating:"The concept of Resistenz leads to a levelling down of fundamental resistance against the system on one hand and actions criticizing more or less accidental, superficial manifestations on the other: the tyrannicide appears on the same plane as the illegal cattle-slaughterer". Hofer maintained that it was intent not effect that should provide the basis of judging resistance and opposition in Nazi Germany, that the things Broszat included under Resistenz were relatively unimportant and had no effect in <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> <b>scheme</b> of things on the Nazi regime's ability to achieve its goals. Klaus-Jürgen Müller argued that the term Widerstand should apply only to those having a [...] "will to overcome the system" [...] and that Broszat's Resistenz concept did too much to muddy the waters between by speaking of societal [...] "immunity" [...] to the regime. A more sympathetic appraisal of the Resistenz concept came from Manfred Messerschmidt and Heinz Boberach who argued that Widerstand should be defined from the viewpoint of the Nazi state and any activity that was contrary to the regime's wishes such as listening to jazz music should be considered as a form of Widerstand.|$|E

40|$|The murals of the Piccolomini Library in Siena Cathedral, {{featuring}} episodes {{from the}} life of Pope Pius II, are usually discussed as distinctly separate from the vault imagery, predominantly all’antica and mythological scenes. The latter, combined with the centrally-placed, antique statue of The Three Graces, has led some authors to comment on the library’s overtly ‘pagan’ content as shockingly incongruent with its setting in the sacred precincts of the duomo. Little attention is paid to the significance of the stucco relief above the entrance, The Expulsion from Paradise. The article proposes that such a prestigious project for so powerful and erudite a patron as Cardinal Francesco Todeschini Piccolomini, and painted by the highly acclaimed artist Pinturicchio, is unlikely to have been devised without careful attention to its iconographical programme. Focussing primarily on the two largest compartments of the vault, it is demonstrated that the four principal figures there should be interpreted as representatives of the four temperaments. By defining their relationship as such to the Expulsion from Paradise relief and to the historical narratives on the walls, this article shows that the mythological scenes in the vault play an allegorical role within <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> <b>scheme</b> and that a coherent programme underpins the entire decoration, with the writings of Saint Augustine and of his fifteenth century followers at its core...|$|E

40|$|Most of {{the lower}} River Murray and its {{floodplain}} wetlands are impacted upon by degradation caused by river regulation. Increasingly the restoration of these ecosystems and the river water quality has become {{a high priority for}} federal and state governments and associated departments and agencies. Public concern is adding to the pressures on these departments and agencies to restore these ecosystems and to sustainably maintain the river water quality. The long term monitoring of floodplain wetlands has been limited, compounding the difficulties faced by managers and decision makers on assessing the potential outcome of restoration options. The role of this project in <b>the</b> <b>broad</b> <b>scheme</b> of restoration/rehabilitation is to contribute to the construction of a model capable of increasing managers and decision makers understanding, and build consensus of potential outcomes of management option. This model was to use available data. The developed model, based on WETMOD developed by Cetin (2001), simulates wetland internal nutrient processes, phytoplankton, zooplankton and macrophyte biomass as well as the interaction (nutrient and phytoplankton exchange) between wetlands and the river. The model further simulates the potential impact management options have on the wetlands, and their nutrient retention capacity, and therefore their impact on the river nutrient load. Due to the limitation of data, wetlands were considered in categories for which data was available. Of these two had sufficient data to develop, calibrate and validate the model. Management scenarios for these two wetlands were developed. These scenarios included, the impact of returning a degraded wetland in a turbid state to a rehabilitated clear state, and the impact the removal of nutrient from irrigation drainage inflows has on wetland nutrient retention, and consequent input to the river. Scenarios of the cumulative impact of the management of multiple wetlands were developed based on using these two wetlands, for which adequate data was available, as “exemplar” wetlands, i. e. data from these wetlands were substituted for other similar wetlands (those identified as belonging to the same category). The model scenarios of these multiple wetlands provide some insight into the potential response management may have on individual wetlands, the cumulative impact on river nutrient load and how wetland morphology may relate to management considerations. The model is restricted by data availability and consequently the outputs. Further, some limitations identified during the development of the model need to be addressed before it can be applied for management purposes. However, the model and methods provide a guide by which monitoring efforts can assist in developing future modelling assessments and gain a greater insight not only at the monitoring site but also on a landscape scale.

Conditions under which OL 8 coefficient estimates are consistent are identified. The standard OL 8 covariance estimate is shown to be inconsistent and a consistent estimator is proposed. Finally, since the conditions under which OL 8 is consistent are quite restrictive, several estimators which are consistent in many cases where OL 8 is not are developed. The large sample distribution properties and an estimator for the asymptotic covariance matrix for the most general of these alternative estimators is also presented. One important application of these findings is to estimating compensating wage differences. Past authors, beginning with Thaler and Rosen (1976) have argued that finer classification schemes would reduce errors-in-variable bias. The analysis presented here suggests that the opposite is true if finer classification results in fewer observations per classification.

The geographical scope is pan-Mediterranean and chronologically it encompasses prehistory {{from the time}} when the earliest-known human records are found on a few islands to the time when most Mediterranean islands had been colonised (approximately {{from the end of the}} Pleistocene to the end of the Iron Age). By questioning established geographical boundaries and chronological restrictions and by incorporating recent theoretical advances in island archaeology, this thesis provides alternative explanations to colonisation paradigms prevalent in the 1980 s and 1990 s, expanding these to include considerations of abandonment and recolonisation. After investigating leading theoretical approachesto colonisation and abandonment, the study reviews the bulk of available publications on Mediterranean islandbased projects from the past ten years, and presents a series of revised colonisation and abandonment dates and models for the islands. At a broader level') these new data indicate the need for clearer distinctions between different types of island-human interaction (e. g. visitation, utilisation, occupation, establishment, abandonment, and re-colonisation). The thesis therefore also analyses - through a series of case studies - how human activity on islands varied spatially and temporally and potential reasons behind different colonisation and abandonment processes. The resulting observations are placed against the backdrop of the changing palaeogeography of the prehistoric Mediterranean, by taking into account changes in sea levels and in the islands' environments, and contextualised within <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> <b>scheme</b> of reference of Mediterranean prehistory.

This is for good reason: even in the rare cases where they provide support for noting matters of public/private business and taboos, calendars barely have any story to tell except indirectly, in aggregate, via mathematical analysis. Rather than delve ourselves into questions as foreboding as the nature and workings of time, most of us rely upon the analyses of others to make use of these documents, particularly as relates to dating the excavated corpora to which they belong. In this talk, I shall provide a layman’s summary of what has been done with such sources to date and what use I think that any scholar of early China might derive from them.

The chief pecuniary losses are destruction of earning power and the expenses of medical care and cure and rehabilitation.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been realized that a general class of non-abelian defects can be created in conventional topological states by introducing extrinsic defects, such as lattice dislocations or superconductor-ferromagnet domain walls in conventional quantum Hall states or topological insulators. In this paper, we begin by placing these defects within <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> conceptual <b>scheme</b> of extrinsic twist defects associated with symmetries of the topological state. We explicitly study several classes of examples, including Z_ 2 and Z_ 3 twist defects, where the topological state with N twist defects can be mapped to a topological state without twist defects on a genus g ∝ N surface. To emphasize this connection we refer to the twist defects as genons. We develop methods to compute the projective non-abelian braiding statistics of the genons, and we find the braiding is given by adiabatic modular transformations, or Dehn twists, of the topological state on the effective genus g surface. We study the relation between this projective braiding statistics and the ordinary non-abelian braiding statistics obtained when the genons become deconfined, finite-energy excitations. We find that the braiding is generally different, {{in contrast to the}} Majorana case, which opens the possibility for fundamentally novel behavior.

40|$|The {{emplacement}} of the Jurassic dolerites of Tasmania {{is considered}} {{in terms of}} the tectonic structure of Tasmania at the time of intrusion. At this time Tasmania consisted of a Permo-Triassic sedimentary cover draped in gentle downwarps over an uneven basement of folded Precambrian-Palaeozoic rocks, with uplifted highs in the west, northeast, and east. Characteristics required for the recognition of dolerite feeders in Tasmania, particularly cones, are discussed and the structures are examined in the light of these. In form, the cones are generally asymmetrical structures. In many cases there is insufficient evidence present to determine whether they represent rootless conical sheets emplaced under a flotational mechanism, or whether they represent conical feeders. Possible modes of emplacement are considered. Some of the cones appear to be secondary structures developed in the sedimentary cover at about the base of the Triassic sequence, possibly from cupola-like structures on underlying sill sheets. The intruding dolerite was controlled by, and also caused, extensive Jurassic faulting. The recognisable tectonic pattern is shown. The faulting in places suggests the development of horstlike and graben-like structures in the downwarps between the main pre-existing highs. Some of the major Tertiary faults of the State were originally lines of Jurassic movements, and there is a suggestion that the Tertiary Midlands, Cressy, Tamar, and possibly the Derwent and Oyster Bay trough structures were inherited, in part, from Jurassic structures. It is considered east-north-easterly and north-easterly tensional forces were important in producing the fault pattern and that it was controlled to a certain extent by the margins of the main pre-existing highs and structural trends in the basement. The greatest fracturing took place in the central trough of the main downwarp between the highs of western and eastern Tasmania. Dolerite magma probably rose here from feeder• dykes and its emplacement was controlled by compensation surfaces, giving rise to transgressive sills, meeting in numerous large dykes, with considerable rafting of sedimentary blocks. Away from the main downwarp, sill sheets were more extensively developed and in <b>the</b> <b>broad</b> <b>scheme</b> their emplacement apparently followed compensation paths. Cone structures were emplaced, apparently mostly on the margins of the downwarps and on small intervening highs. On the upper flanks of the main highs, feeders were mainly plug and dyke-like plugs. Where basement highs exceeded heights of about 4, 000 feet above the basement level in the downwarps, dolerite feeders were lacking. At the time of the dolerite intrusions Tasmania was probably situated below the Antarctic Circle, just east of the Ross Sea, and comparisons are made with the similar Ferrar dolerites of Antarctica. Differences in the emplacement of the dolerite appear to be due to structural differences between the two regions at the time of emplacement. Only limited comparisons can be made between Jurassic trends associated with the dolerites of the two regions, but maxima in the trends of Tasmanian dykes were apparently similarly orientated to those of Antarctica...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{will focus on}} the {{question}} of what theoretical object we should use to represent the meaning of certain sentences. In particular, I {{will focus on the}} question of whether we should use propositions to represent the meaning of indicative conditionals. Before getting into this question I’ll try to locate it in <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> <b>scheme</b> of things. In recent years, the so-called semantic/pragmatics debate has focused on the gap be-tween sentence meaning and speaker meaning. Generally, participants in that debate take for granted that we use sentences to express propositions, objects that at the minimum deter-mine a set of truth-conditions. The semantics/pragmatics debate focuses on how sentences are used to express propositions. However, the question I will focus on is not how sentences come to express whatever they do express, but rather what, at the end of the day, they do express. There is plenty of controversy about whether sentences really do express propositions, even after pragmatic enrichment. There are some philosophical traditions that view talk of truth conditions and propositions as generally suspect. 1 The considerations that push people to this view tend to be programmatic philosophical ones. I am not going to discuss this sort of blanket anti-propositionalism. However, even outside of these traditions there are some who think that, while sen-tences can in general express propositions, as it happens some sentences of our language do not do so. There are usually two different sorts of motivations for this view. On the one hand, you might think that the kind of facts a given part of language aims to express simply don’t exist. For instance, many philosophers worry about whether moral claims can really, properly speaking, be true or false. This worry then extends to a worry abou...|$|E
40|$|This thesis, {{rising from}} the field of {{reflexive}} International Relations (IR), is an engagement with knowledge production in the domain of international relations. Guided by sociology of knowledge, it offers a critique of representations of the international produced by IR theory and practice. The thesis argues that such representations may gain power to frame the thinking and policy action with respect to objects beyond their immediate description. In my work I expose how thinking about international relations in particular ways affects conceptions of and policies implemented with regard to the state. I focus specifically on the idea of international society developed by International Relations theory and the idea of international community, flourishing in policy practice. Both are contrasted with representations of the international produced in Russia with particular reference to the idea of the Russian World. The idea of international society and the cognate concept of international community reinforce the production of universal norms and standards of what a state is and should be. They are conducive to thinking about a state in terms of well-functioning institutions allowing it to meet international standards and to form part of the society of states. The idea of the Russian World, in turn, facilitates the portrayal of Russia as a polity greater than a state and helps legitimize disregard for the sovereignty of other post-Soviet states. Constructing the international in terms of a confrontation between the Russian World and the West requires efforts to strengthen a polity transcending Russian borders. In <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> <b>scheme,</b> the research project is dedicated to thinking through similarities in the processes of knowledge production cutting across easily permeable boundaries between the academia and policy practice, the West and Russia.

40|$|LawLL. D. The {{contract}} of insurance {{is one of}} the more frequently concluded commercial contracts. The premium which is undertaken in terms of an insurance contract {{is one of the}} essential features of the insurance contract. Notwithstanding the obvious importance of the role of the premium and the legal aspects surrounding it, it has in the past often received but scant treatment in insurance-law materials. In this thesis it is shown that there exist a number of aspects regarding the premium which are unclear and in need of careful scrutiny. In the case of certain other aspects (regarding the premium), although there is certainty as to their contents it is necessary to identify and (re-) define their place in <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> <b>scheme</b> of the insurance law. The study commences with an investigation into the historical development of the concepts of "insurance" and "premium". This is followed by a study of the relevant principles of Roman-Dutch law. A comparative study is made of the law in a number of countries, namely, the Netherlands, Belgium, England and Australia. The position in South African law is also considered. An introductory study is made regarding those concepts in South African indigenous law which are insurance-like. Finally, a number of conclusions are drawn and recommendations are made in respect of a selection of aspects regarding the premium which are unclear. These aspects concern the nature of the premium; the question whether "premiumless" or "free" insurance is legally possible; the question whether the parties may agree to insure at a "reasonable premium"; the protection of the insured in the case of the non­ payment of the premium; the receipt of the premium by the broker; the return of the premium where the insured has acted fraudulently; the legal tenability of the practice of insuring the premium; the possibility that the contribution in terms of some concepts of our indigenous law may resemble the premium; and finally, the analogous method as a source of law to extend and broaden the pool of legal principles applicable to the insurance contract...|$|E
