40|$|Abstract—HCCI {{combustion}} can substantially reduce NOx and soot {{emissions of}} diesel engines. However {{it is hard}} for diesel HCCI to obtain the same level of fuel economy as traditional diesel engines. HCCI lacks an easily identified combustion trigger and, when achieved via variable valve actuation (VVA), includes cycle-to-cycle coupling through the exhaust gas. This makes controlling the process decidedly non-trivial. To address these issues, the development of a closed-loop controller for HCCI combustion phasing and peak pressure was outlined. Results from both simulation and experiment show that cycle-to-cycle control of VVA-induced HCCI can be achieved using this physics-based approach. Correct combustion timing is crucial for proper engine performance in a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine. To stabilize unstable operating points, reject system disturbances and enable set point changes, it is necessary to use a combustion timing controller. In this, variable valve timing was used <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>combustion</b> timing, optimising fuel systems By means of the variable valve timing, residual gases were captured in cylinder to facilitate combustion timing control...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of new combustion concepts {{is to meet}} emission standards by improving fuel air mixing prior to ignition. Since there is no overlap between injection and ignition, combustion is governed mainly by chemical kinetics and {{it is challenging to}} control the phasing of ignition.

In this study the dual fuel blend is prepared with gasoline and diesel fuels. The applied injection timings of the diesel are very early (90 to 60 ° CA bTDC). In the detailed reaction mechanism, n-heptane and iso-octane represent diesel and gasoline fuel, respectively. A multi-zone model approach is implemented to perform RCCI combustion simulation. Ignition characteristics are analyzed by using CA 50 as the main parameter. In the experiments for the early direct injection (DI) timing advancing the injection time results in a later ignition. Qualitatively, the trend effect of the diesel injection timing and the effect of the ratio gasoline/diesel are captured accurately by the multi-zone model...|$|E
40|$|<b>To</b> <b>control</b> <b>combustion</b> systems it is {{advantageous}} to monitor Oodulation (CoSM), where two broadband light sources are intensity modulated in anti-phase, {{and where the}} first source is coupled to the measurement sample after passing through the reference sample, whereas the second is directly-coupled.

The subsequent difference in attenuation, that light originating from each source suffers in the measurement region, results in an amplitude modulation of the beam after transmission through the measurement cell. The amplitude modulation index is indicative of the concentration of target gas present in this measurement cell. We present analyses to show predictions of the magnitude of this modulation index and the anticipated signal to noise ratio in measurements, factors which indicate the expected minimum detectable gas concentration. Spectral absorption data of the gases is obtained from the publicly available HITRAN database.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the effects of direct-current electric fields {{on the behavior of}} the small-scale diffusion ethanol flame. The flow rate of liquid ethanol, the flame temperatures, and the flame shapes were measured. The results showed that the stable working ranges of a small-scale combustor became narrower under the direct-current electric field. The main reason was that the evaporation velocity of liquid ethanol limited by great heat loss effect cannot keep up with the increasing of combustion velocity by the ionic wind effect. The movements of those charged particles in flame enhanced the combustion process, resulting in higher flame temperatures under positive or negative direct-current electric field. The flame heights decreased with increasing applied voltages, due to the ionic wind effect increasing the flame temperature and the diffusivity. The flame voltage–current characteristic was also examined. Three regions can be divided: the subsaturation region, the saturation region, and the supersaturation region. Finally, the ratios of electric active power to actual burning thermal power of ethanol flame were calculated.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} feasibility of a photodiode <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>combustion,</b> instead of a spectrometer (which is an expensive sensor to be used in commercial burners). For that purpose, the flame emission has been measured in a hot-water boiler fired with light fuel-oil, whose nominal output power goes up to 370 kW. The parameters investigated were: overall air excess, combustion air distribution, burner power and atmospheric conditions. High influence of air distribution on the flame emission was detected by the diode, since it modifies directly the mixing quality reducing rich-fuel regions where soot can be formed. Low influence of air excess and burner power was found. When these parameters increase, the flame emission decreases. This behavior is explained by the better mixing attained at high burner power and at high air excess. However the high emission level observed at low firing rate can be reduced with a good burner adjustment. With the photodiode, it was possible to find the optimum air excess value where NO, CO and soot are as low as possible. As the photodiode measures locally in the flame, results were compared with images obtained with a CCD camera.

40|$|The {{operating}} range of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines {{is limited by}} the knock boundary on one side and by high cyclic variations (misfire) on the other side. A challenging problem for HCCI engines is achieving cycle-by-cycle ignition control due to these variations. <b>To</b> <b>control</b> <b>combustion</b> in HCCI engines, it is essential to understand how parameters affect the cyclic variations of HCCI combustion. This paper investigates cyclic variability of HCCI combustion using experimental data collected at 360 operating points from a single cylinder Ricardo engine.

The experimental results show there are three main distinct patterns of cyclic variations for combustion peak pressure (Pmax), Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP) and ignition timing. These patterns include normal cyclic variations, periodic cyclic variations and cyclic variations with weak/misfired ignitions.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the last}} decade, CO 2 capture on coal power plants {{has been the}} subject of {{sustained}} attention as one of the most credible way to drastically reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Significant reduction in the energy penalty related to the oxy- combustion routes has been achieved but uncertainties remain in the operation of such a process inducing major modifications of the power island. In this context, for oxy-combustion, and more generally carbon capture to become a reality, its energy penalty shall be drastically reduced. In that perspective, cutting edge strategies allowing taking full advantage of oxy-fired operation have to be investigated. Among them, boiler pressurization has been identified as one of the most promising solution. Two major pressurized oxy-combustion concepts have emerged in literature: the flameless combustion technology (ISOTHERM®) and the staged-pressurized oxy-combustion (SPOC) concept. According to the authors describing those two processes, whilst very different in the combustion temperature control strategy, they both succeed in allowing pressurized operation. In this work, those two concepts have been compared to an air-fired, a conservative and optimized atmospheric oxy-fired power plants in terms of energy performances. The reason underlying below the observed differences, have been determined using exergy analysis. The SPOC process leads to significantly lower energy penalty, as low as 3. 8 %-pts compared to the ISOTHERM® concepts which lead to performance in the same order of magnitude than the optimized atmospheric design.

40|$|Combustion {{instability}} {{problems have}} been experienced during nearly every rocket engine development program, characterized by chamber pressure oscillations and high density of energy release in a volume having relatively low losses. Several distinct types of instability and their physical manifestations have been observed, although the frequency and amplitude of these oscillations and their external manifestations normally vary {{with the type of}} instability. The most destructive type of instability is referred to as high frequency instability, resonant combustion or acoustic instability, which is usually eliminated by use of passive control, involving installation of baffles, resonators, or some other modification of geometry. The main purpose of this work is the experimental investigation of use of passive control devices (Helmholtz resonators and baffles) to control acoustic instabilities in combustion chambers, because this type of instability occurs in liquid rocket engines, rocket motors and industrial burners. The first step of this research is the acoustic characterization of chamber, thus cold tests were carried out on full-scale chamber model to analyze the effects of resonators. Experimental frequency spectrum data are in excellent agreement with resonant frequencies and damping rate calculated by theoretical model, demonstrating resonators efficiency to reduce the amplitude of Sound Pressure Level at given resonant frequency. Afterwards, hot tests were carried out on burner with and without resonators, identifying the frequency spectrum of acoustic pressure in chamber, which was compared with cold tests (full-scale model) results and theory by correction factors of temperature, density, and viscosity. The experimental data validated the methodology to design resonators useable <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>combustion</b> instabilities...|$|E

A low-order model is developed, reconciling along the way two different approaches taken by researchers to attack the description of combustion instabilities. The model is demonstrated with application to a Rijke tube and compared to experiments. The Rijke burner experiments suggest two major discrepancies with the model: the presence of a hysteresis loop is unaccounted for and the model does not describe the seemingly random fluctuations in the amplitude of the pressure oscillations in the 'unstable' regime. So far no explanation for the hysteresis can be given; however, this phenomenon is successfully exploited by using a novel nonlinear <b>control</b> technique <b>to</b> expand the stable operating range of the burner. The origin of the 'noise' in the pressure trace is explained by considering entropy and vorticity waves in the combustor. Their presence leads to a slight modification of the original model, introducing stochastic source terms into the oscillator equations. The consequences of the presence of these terms is analyzed by means of simulations. One interesting result is that they allow for the identification of model parameters from a single experimental run of a stable combustion system. Finally, a unified approach <b>to</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>combustion</b> instabilities is presented.
