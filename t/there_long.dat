5|$|A {{group that}} opposed the hippie {{movement}} {{managed to keep}} Guldy off the mayoral ballot in 1975. He became a write-in candidate for village trustee, with his friend, poet George Montgomery, running for mayor. Montgomery lost the election to Raivo Puusemp, a sculptor from SoHo. After his election, Puusemp chided Guldy for being a poor role model for the village youth. Puusemp was not a native of Rosendale and had not lived <b>there</b> <b>long.</b> By early July 1975, Puusemp had appointed a village dog warden after a dog bit a child and was allowed to run about the streets unrestrained.|$|E
5|$|In 1540 Montejo the Elder, {{who was now}} in {{his late}} 60s, turned his royal rights to {{colonise}} Yucatán over to his son, Francisco Montejo the Younger. In early 1541 Montejo the Younger joined his cousin in Champton; he did not remain <b>there</b> <b>long,</b> and quickly moved his forces to Campeche. Once there Montejo the Younger, commanding between three and four hundred Spanish soldiers, established the first permanent Spanish town council in the Yucatán Peninsula. Shortly afterwards, Montejo the Younger summoned the local Maya lords and commanded them {{to submit to the}} Spanish Crown. A number of lords submitted peacefully, including the ruler of the Xiu Maya. The lord of the Canul Maya refused to submit and Montejo the Younger sent his cousin against them (also called Francisco de Montejo); Montejo the Younger remained in Campeche awaiting reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not quite}} clear where Gaveston spent his time abroad; the {{conditions}} of his exile banned him from staying {{in any of the}} lands of the English king. This precluded both Aquitaine and Ireland, where he had spent his previous exiles. There is some evidence that he might have gone to France initially, but considering the French king's hostile attitude towards him, he is not likely to have stayed <b>there</b> <b>long.</b> Flanders is a much more likely candidate for Gaveston's third and final exile. This time his absence was even shorter than the second time, lasting no more than two months. Returning around Christmas 1311, he was reunited with the King early in 1312, probably at Knaresborough on 13 January. The reason for his quick return might have been the birth of his child, a daughter named Joan, around this time. On 18 January, Edward declared the judgement against Gaveston unlawful, and restored all lands to him.|$|E

Sanh's father was a police officer. and it has been speculated that the family were of Chinese descent.

5|$|On 2 March 1737, penniless, Johnson {{left for}} London {{with his former}} pupil David Garrick. To make things worse, Johnson {{received}} word that his brother had died on the day they left. However, their prospects were not completely hopeless, as Garrick was set to inherit a large sum the next year. Also, Garrick had connections in London, and the two would stay with his distant relative, Richard Norris, who lived on Exeter Street. Johnson did not stay <b>there</b> <b>long,</b> and set out for Greenwich near the Golden Hart Tavern to finish Irene. During that time, he wrote to Cave on 12 July 1737 and proposed a translation for Paolo Sarpi's The History of the Council of Trent (1619), which Cave did not accept until months later.|$|E

The German objective was to bombard Sunderland the following day, based on extensive reconnaissance conducted by Zeppelins and submarines. Active and eight of her destroyers were summoned to rendezvous with the main body of the Grand Fleet and met up with them the following afternoon, but they did not encounter the High Seas Fleet. The cruiser did not remain <b>there</b> <b>long</b> and {{was assigned}} to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla of the Dover Patrol by January 1917.

25|$|Gustav Nyquist {{was sent}} down to Grand Rapids from Detroit, {{but was not}} {{expected}} to remain <b>there</b> <b>long.</b> The move was primarily intended to keep the team under its salary cap, since Nyquist could be transferred without having to clear waivers. The Griffins signed several new skaters during the off-season, giving the roster a mix of veterans and young prospects. New additions included goaltender Jared Coreau; defensemen Alexei Marchenko, Richard Nedomlel and Xavier Ouellet; forwards Martin Frk, David McIntyre and Marek Tvrdon. McIntyre {{was the only one}} of the seven with previous American Hockey League experience. The team re-signed defensemen Nathan Paetsch and Brennan Evans, and forwards Triston Grant and team captain Jeff Hoggan, as well as several skaters who had played only a handful of games the previous year, including center Calle Järnkrok, winger Teemu Pulkkinen, and defenseman Ryan Sproul.|$|E

Pope Paul V immediately drew what may have been the correct conclusion and threw him into prison as a spy. However, the good pope changed his mind shortly, perhaps still hoping to reconvert the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and decided accept the matter graciously, placing Thomas in Italy. He used his influence with Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, to get Thomas appointed to the professorship of the Pandects at Pisa. The Grand Duke commissioned him also to write a definitive work on the Etruscans.|$|E

25|$|During 1922, {{when he hit}} his highest {{first-class}} {{score of}} 201, Jeacocke {{was involved in a}} controversy over his registration to play for Surrey. He was born outside of the county of Surrey, but qualified to play for the team through having lived <b>there</b> <b>long</b> enough to be eligible. In August, Kent questioned his qualification on the grounds that he technically lived in Kent—his house was within the Kent boundary, although {{the other side of the}} road fell within Surrey. The situation arose through a housing shortage; when Jeacocke married in 1920, there were no suitable houses for him and his wife, so his father lent him a house rent-free. Jeacocke missed the remainder of the season, but Percy Fender, the county captain, defended him in the press and pointed out that the letter of the law meant that Jeacocke would have to re-qualify, making him ineligible until 1924. Kent were probably driven by Lord Harris, the influential treasurer of the MCC and chairman of Kent. During the same season, Harris had forced Gloucestershire to drop Wally Hammond from their team as he had not properly qualified for the team; he later defended Kent's actions in the press and equated any disagreement with Bolshevism. The Jeacocke episode generated much criticism of Lord Harris in the press, and the qualification rules were changed before the 1923 season so that a player was considered to be qualified for a county for the rest of his career once he had played three seasons with the club—as Jeacocke had.|$|E
