5|$|Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan now had the {{financial}} resources to produce shows themselves, without outside backers. Carte persuaded the author and composer that a business partnership among the three would be to their advantage, and they hatched a plan to separate themselves from the directors of <b>the</b> <b>Comedy</b> Opera Company. The contract between Gilbert and Sullivan and <b>the</b> <b>Comedy</b> Opera Company gave the latter the right to present Pinafore {{for the duration of}} the initial run. The Opera Comique was obliged to close for drain and sewer repairs, and it was renovated by E. W. Bradwell, from Christmas 1878 to the end of January 1879. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte believed that this break ended the initial run, and, therefore, ended the company's rights. Carte put the matter beyond doubt by taking a six-month personal lease of the theatre beginning on 1 February 1879, the date of its re-opening, when Pinafore resumed. At the end of the six months, Carte planned to give notice to <b>the</b> <b>Comedy</b> Opera Company that its rights in the show and the theatre had ended.|$|E
