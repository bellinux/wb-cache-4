60|$|There {{could be}} no doubt of that. Reginald Carne, seeing that his assailants, as he {{considered}} them, could not get at him, was making gestures of triumph and derision at them. Now from the second floor windows, the flames began <b>to</b> <b>spurt</b> <b>out,</b> the glass clattering down on to the gravel below.|$|E

When the blood began <b>to</b> <b>spurt</b> <b>out,</b> he took my hands in one of his, holding them tight, {{and with the other}} seized my neck and pressed my mouth to the wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some to the [...] . Oh, my God! My God! What have I done? What have I done to deserve such a fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril. And in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!" [...] Then she began to rub her lips as though to cleanse them from pollution.|$|E

5000|$|Usually {{functioning}} as the boke, Ōtake {{is famous for}} his ability <b>to</b> spontaneously <b>spurt</b> <b>out</b> meaningless, yet funny lines, and for his crude jokes (shimoneta). His amazing ability to entertain audiences with strange, nonsensical gags was dubbed [...] "Ōtake World" [...] on Uchi-P. He was told many times that he looked like his partner Mimura, and decided to wear glasses in order to distinguish himself. He does not, however, normally wear glasses. He enjoys wearing short sleeves over long sleeved T-shirts, and has been given the title [...] "King of Sexual Harassment".|$|R
50|$|Things get trickier for Tiffany {{when she}} discovers {{she has some}} of the Summer Lady's powers—plants start to grow where she walks barefooted, and the Cornucopia appears, causing {{problems}} by <b>spurting</b> <b>out</b> food and animals.|$|R

5000|$|Aluminium {{reacts with}} lye: 2NaOH + 2Al + 2H2O → 3H2 + 2NaAlO2, {{although}} the exact species in solution may be NaAl(OH)4. The release of hydrogen gas stirs the mixture and improves {{the interaction between}} the lye and the materials clogging the drain. It's possible that pressure may build up inside the pipe, causing the hot, caustic solution <b>to</b> <b>spurt</b> <b>out</b> of the drain.|$|E
50|$|While {{the four}} of them manage to make Sunako {{physically}} beautiful enough to become a lady, the problem lies with her attitude and interests (which Sunako has no intention of changing). Up until the most recent release in the story, they manage to convince Sunako's aunt that her niece is indeed a lady befitting the mansion in which they live (and prevent the rent from skyrocketing to triple the required amount). However, in reality Sunako has not changed at all. Sunako has the tendency <b>to</b> <b>spurt</b> <b>out</b> in a nose bleed when seen by bright creatures, especially around Kyohei.|$|E
50|$|During a {{detention}} {{caused by}} her slapping her rival Kelly Hennenlotter (Terri Hawkes), who she envisioned was Mary Lou, Vicki is {{dragged into the}} classroom chalkboard, which turns to liquid. Taking control of Vicki's body, Mary Lou visits Buddy at the church and, revealing her identity to him, kills him by stabbing {{him in the face}} with a miniature crucifix. Disposing of Buddy's corpse, Mary Lou makes over Vicki's body, her new mannerisms and style of dress arousing the concern of Vicki's friend Monica Waters. After confronting Mary Lou in the girls locker room, Monica is murdered by Mary Lou when, after hiding from Mary Lou in a locker, she is crushed when Mary Lou makes the locker collapse in on her, causing Monica's brain <b>to</b> <b>spurt</b> <b>out</b> through the locker ventilation slits.|$|E
5000|$|The great {{enemy of}} clear {{language}} is insincerity. When {{there is a}} gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish <b>spurting</b> <b>out</b> ink.|$|R

50|$|Prior to Newcomen {{a number}} of small steam devices of various sorts had been made, but most were {{essentially}} novelties. Around 1600 {{a number of}} experimenters used steam to power small fountains working like a coffee percolator. First a container was filled with water via a pipe, which extended through the top of the container to nearly the bottom. The bottom of the pipe would be submerged in the water, making the container airtight. The container was then heated to make the water boil. The steam generated pressurized the container, but the inner pipe, immersed at the bottom by liquid, and lacking an airtight seal at top, remained at a lower pressure; expanding steam forced the water {{at the bottom of the}} container into and up the pipe <b>to</b> <b>spurt</b> <b>out</b> of a nozzle on top. These devices had limited effectiveness but illustrated the principle's viability.|$|E
5000|$|Shogun Warriors plays {{similarly}} {{to some other}} 2D versus fighting games during its release, which the player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. It is controlled with an 8-way joystick and 4 buttons that perform weak and strong versions of punches and kicks. In one player mode, after selecting a character, the arcade randomly selects an opponent. The opponent order goes randomly and always leaves the last four bosses in a certain order. Some characters stabbed by ones armed with katanas or other sharp weapons can cause blood <b>to</b> <b>spurt</b> <b>out,</b> which became popularized {{a few months later}} by Midway's Mortal Kombat. The main unique feature of Shogun Warriors is its [...] "grabbing system". When the player is grabbed by the opponent, the grabber must move the joystick left and right to {{make it more difficult for}} his opponent to escape, while the one being grabbed must rapidly press any or all buttons to make it easier to escape.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the opening}} scene, Scrat, the saber-toothed {{squirrel}} climbs a glacier to bury his acorn, but accidentally opens {{a hole in}} it, causing water <b>to</b> <b>spurt</b> <b>out.</b> The world of ice is slowly melting. The creatures of the Ice Age are all shown enjoying themselves on slides and pools made by the melting ice; among them the three protagonists of the first film: Manny, Sid, and Diego. Sid opens a small day camp, where none of the younger creatures take him seriously, nor do Manny and Diego, which leaves Sid seeking a daring deed. Fast Tony, a local con artist is claiming that the earth will flood and that the bark and reeds which he sells are needed to stay alive. Manny dismisses the idea, but is distracted when he sees that Sid will try to high dive from a giant waterfall known as [...] "the Eviscerator"; as Manny goes with Diego {{to the top of}} the Eviscerator to save Sid from his act of daredevilry, suddenly the ice under Diego's feet begins breaking, causing him to bolt in fear, this also made Sid figure out that Diego is afraid of the water. The herd figure that the pleasant weather has caused the ice shelves to melt, and it is kept from destroying the valley only by the glaciers, which have formed a dam.|$|E

50|$|On July 15, 1888 {{there was}} an {{explosion}} of water vapour in a Kobandai eruption. It is believed that hot ground water continuously <b>spurting</b> <b>out</b> had weathered the mountain and this caused it to collapse. This caused an avalanche of debris to bury 5 nearby villages on the north foot of the mountain and 477 people were killed.|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly Gavinia felt an {{exquisite}} thrill: {{a man was}} pursuing her. She slipped the paper-bag out of sight, holding it dexterously against her side with her arm, so that the gravy should not <b>spurt</b> <b>out,</b> and ran. Lights flashed, a kingly voice cried [...] "Now!" [...] and immediately a petticoat was flung over her head. (The Lady Griselda looked thin that evening.) ...|$|R
