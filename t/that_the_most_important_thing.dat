Gaga incorporated theatrics in her live performances of the songs from the album. Hence she hoped that people would take notice of the performance art, which she was trying to bring back with the album and its music; according to her, the music put the lifestyle in front of it.|$|E

25|$|Šarūnas {{started going}} to school in Jonas Jablonskis Middle School in 1982 and {{attended}} it till 1987. He {{had to take the}} bus to go to school even though the thermometer outside read minus twenty and he knew <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> for his parents was that he spent as little time as possible with the toughest people of Partizanai Street. From 1987 to 1993, he was studying at Kaunas 4th Middle School. His first trip destination was Moscow, which he visited before the tournament. Jasikevičius's greatest youth memory in the city was the opening of the first McDonald's in Russia. He remembers that his classmates were listening with their mouths gaping when he was narrating about the French fries, bread rolls with minced beef and fizzy drinks. One of his childhood passions was history, especially about the Native Americans, as well as books about basketball as he was capable of reading a book of more than four hundred pages on basketball in two days. He was also curious about politics, especially when Perestroika began, because of which he was able to travel to Berlin with his father and brother, and was amazed by the visit to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. His childhood favorite Lithuanian player was Arvydas Sabonis, which he admired more than other Lithuanian superstars, such as Rimas Kurtinaitis and Valdemaras Chomičius, due to his passing. However, his idol was Dražen Petrović, and he wished {{to be as good as}} him, watching matches of him over and over again, dozens of times, for hours and hours, and later started imitating him in workouts. After one of his trips, his dad came back with a videocassette recorder, using which he was able to record an NBA All-Star Game with Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, David Robinson, and later to watch it for couple of years, more than hundred times. Jasikevičius also started to record games of Žalgiris and Petrović every time he was able to. Thanks to the video recorder, he discovered the existence of a no-look pass of Magic Johnson. For him, he was the NBA, not Michael Jordan. His unselfishness, imagination and the way he dribbled, passed between his opponent's legs bewitched Jasikevičius. Consequently, his favorite element of basketball quickly became assisting his teammates, and he was trying to do it like Petrović or Johnson.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} round, Washington was matched {{up with the}} top-seeded New York Rangers. After losing Game 1 by giving up two goals in a 1:30 span, Washington took a 2–0 lead in Game 2, {{only to have the}} Rangers come back and tie the score in the third period. The Capitals, however, won the game on an Ovechkin power-play goal late in the third. Game 3 was a triple-overtime contest that ended when Marian Gaborik scored to give New York a 2–1 win. The 114:41 game was the 20th longest game in NHL history, and Washington's third-longest game in {{franchise}} history. Washington evened the series in Game 4 with a one-goal win. In the win, Ovechkin was benched {{for the majority of the}} third period, where after the tilt, he noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> was that the Capitals won the game. Washington looked to be heading for their first series lead as Game 5 was coming to an end. The Capitals were leading 2–1 with 21.3 seconds remaining when Joel Ward took a double minor penalty for high-sticking. On the ensuing power play, Brad Richards scored with 6.6 seconds left in regulation to tie the game. The Rangers remained on the power play to start the overtime period, with Ward serving the second half of his double minor when Marc Staal scored to give New York the win. Facing elimination in Game 6, Washington took the lead 1:28 into the game on an Ovechkin power play tally. They did not trail in the game and won 2–1 to force Game 7. Ovechkin's goal was the 30th of his post-season career, which tied him for the Capitals all-time franchise record with Peter Bondra. In the deciding game, Brad Richards scored 1:32 into the first period helping New York to the eventual 2–1 victory and the series win.

2500|$|Hoiles {{was born}} on November 24, 1878 in Alliance, Ohio into a middle-class family. His parents were Samuel Harrison Hoiles, a farmer, and his wife, Ann Ladd Hoiles. [...] The family farm was located on the {{outskirts}} of the town, which had 4,000 inhabitants at that time. [...] Hoiles went to a school in town; in his elderliness he remarked <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> he had learned there was [...] "that the State, or a majority of citizens, had the right to use taxation to support the public school system". He once mockingly said of his education that [...] "attending government schools … handicapped me in developing my moral and mental faculties. … n short it retarded my education." [...] According to Carl Watner, Hoiles learned from his father at the time he graduated from high school that he should [...] "never ask anybody to do something for him that he was not prepared to do himself".

2500|$|Another {{powerful}} argument hooks discusses is one {{in which}} she describes how starting from a very young age, boys and girls are constantly being knocked down and told to fit into the tiny boxes of characteristics that are expected of them. Hooks points out that the boy is denied his right to show, or even have, any true feelings. To further explain, she uses men in the American culture as an example, and describes how they have been socialized to mistrust the value and power of love. While the girl is taught <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> she can do is change herself and her own feelings, with the hopes of attracting and pleasing everyone else. These unfair expectations lead boys and girls to grow up into {{men and women who are}} convinced that lies are the way to go, and no one should be showing their truest feelings to each other. This leads to the paradox hooks points out because in order to have a functional, and healthy loving relationship, honesty is a natural requirement. In bell hooks's own words, [...] "Lies may make people feel better, but they do not help them to know love" [...] (hooks). Another central argument in hooks's All About Love is the way in which it is almost impossible for women to find happiness in what she sees as a brutal culture where men are taught to worry more about sexual satisfaction and performance than actually loving someone. This reality pointed out by hooks, paired with the fact that women focus so strongly on obtaining themselves a partner, leads to most relationships being completely one sided. In this case, the men are emotionally satisfied, and the women are left without any true happiness. Hooks points out that despite these evident problems in modern-day love culture, love can be revived, and this is what she is arguing throughout her book.|$|E

60|$|Half an {{hour later}} the bearers hove the pole to their woolly crowns, and plodded on again. They were not men of any great intelligence, and were usually content {{to do what they}} were told without asking questions, which was a custom that had its advantages. They had also an unreasoning and half-instinctive {{confidence}} in the man who led them, and in due time they plodded into sight of the town one night when the muggy land breeze was blowing. Like other West African towns, the place straggles up and back from the seaboard bluff, with wide spaces between the houses, and nobody seemed stirring when Ormsgill's boys marched into the outskirts of it. Remembering what the priest of San Thome had told him of the man whose wife he had sent the girl Anita to, he presently bade them stop outside the building which stood well apart from the rest. Some of them were roofed with corrugated iron, and some with picturesque tiles, but the top of this one was flat, which Ormsgill was pleased to see. He recognized that it was built in the older Iberian style which is not uncommon in Western Africa and ensures the inmates privacy. There are no outbuildings where this plan is adopted. The house stands four-square and self-contained, presenting an almost unbroken wall to the outer world, though there is usually an open patio in the midst of it. One of the boys rapped upon a door, and when it was opened by a negro his comrades unceremoniously marched down an arched passage under the building until they reached the enclosed patio. Ormsgill had impressed them with the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> was to get in.|$|E
