5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} four novels, Fleming {{came up with}} the concept of the front cover design; he considered Honeychile Rider to have a Venus-like quality when introduced in the book and wanted this echoed on <b>the</b> <b>cover.</b> When Fleming commissioned Pat Marriott to illustrate <b>the</b> <b>cover,</b> he instructed that she be shown on a Venus elegans shell.|$|E
5|$|Controversy arose {{regarding}} the artwork for <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> for the Classics VHS cassette {{when the film}} was first released on video when close examination of the artwork revealed an oddly shaped structure on the castle, closely resembling a human penis. Disney and <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> designer insist it was an accident, resulting from a late night rush job to finish <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> artwork. The questionable object does not appear on <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> of the second releasing of the movie. A second allegation is that a clergyman is seen with an erection during a scene late in the film. The clergyman is a short man, dressed in Bishop's clothing, and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in {{a few of the}} frames that are actually later shown to be the stubby-legged man's knees, but the image is small and is very difficult to distinguish. The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file suit against The Walt Disney Company in 1995, though she dropped the suit two months later.|$|E

The artwork found in Badorb.com releases was similar to the Orb's odd artwork of the mid-1990s, as it was stylistically similar and contained little writing.
