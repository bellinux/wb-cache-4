[...] "It was really scary," [...] he said later. [...] "I'd already {{signed a contract}} and been paid all this money. And then I'd gotten a divorce and half the money was already with my ex-wife. My instincts were telling me, This book is fucked. Just drop it. But I didn't, because I thought, What if I {{have to give the}} money back?"

500|$|Bharathiraja wanted Chithra Lakshmanan, {{who was an}} {{assistant}} director with K. Bhagyaraj, to sign Kamal Haasan {{for the role of}} Chappani, expecting to pay Kamal [...] since the actor had received [...] for Aayirathil Oruthi (1975). When Kamal asked for , Lakshmanan suggested that Bharathiraja offer the role to Sivakumar since the production unit could not afford Kamal's request; however, Bharathiraja saw Kamal as the ideal choice and agreed to pay him [...] For his character, the actor grew his curly hair long and wore lungis and khadi high-buttoned shirts. In 2017, Kamal recalled, [...] "Years ago, a man sporting a soiled dhoti and shirt came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>office</b> to narrate a script. Had I turned the offer down {{on the basis of his}} dirty clothes, I wouldn’t have been here talking to you. After listening to the script, I realised that he was such a genius and the movie was the cult classic , and he was none other than ace Bharathiraja sir". Bharathiraja also recalled that he showed a [...] "handsome Kamal Haasan in an ugly way" [...] as he wanted to prove that characters need not always be attractive, and to break this stereotype in the film industry.|$|E
500|$|Nick Offerman portrayed Ron Swanson, the {{director}} of the parks and recreation department, and Aubrey Plaza played April Ludgate, a sarcastic and uninterested college intern. [...] The part was written specifically for Plaza. After meeting her, [...] casting director Allison Jones told Schur, [...] "I just met the weirdest girl I've ever met in my life. You have to meet her and put her on your show." [...] Schur of meeting her, [...] "Aubrey came over <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>office</b> and made me feel really uncomfortable for like an hour, and immediately I wanted to put her in the show," [...] although the writers were not immediately sure what direction her character would take. Rounding out the main cast was Paul Schneider, best known for his work in independent films such as Lars and the Real Girl and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. He was cast as Mark Brendanawicz, a city planner and Leslie's unrequited love interest. She still harbors feelings for Mark from a one-night sexual encounter years ago. Schneider said that early in the season he was insecure in the role because he was {{still trying to figure out}} the character's motivations. Chris Pratt played Andy Dwyer, Ann's well-intentioned but lazy and simple-minded boyfriend. Although Pratt appeared in every episode of season 1, he was credited as guest star until the second season, when he was promoted to the main cast. Andy was originally supposed to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make Andy a regular character if the show was renewed.|$|E

2500|$|Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>office</b> {{the other}} day to recount his country's {{remarkable}} transformation. He described a nation {{of people who are}} harder-working, more virtuous – yes, more virtuous, because the market punishes immorality – and more hopeful about the future than they've ever been in their history. I asked Mr. Laar where his government got the idea for these reforms. Do you know what he replied? He said, [...] "We read Milton Friedman and F. A. Hayek." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his {{autobiography}} From Hope to Higher Ground, Huckabee recalled the chilly reception {{that he received}} from the Arkansas Democratic establishment on his election as lieutenant governor: [...] "The doors <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>office</b> were spitefully nailed shut from the inside, office furniture and equipment were removed, and the budget spent down to almost nothing prior to our arriving.

2500|$|Psychoanalysts {{today do}} not regard {{cross-dressing}} by {{itself as a}} psychological problem, unless it interferes with a person's life.

Spitzer subsequently announced that he would indefinitely suspend his communications director, Darren Dopp, and reassign another top official. When questioned about his promise to bring ethical responsibility to state politics, Spitzer responded by saying [...] "I will not tolerate this behavior", [...] "ethics and accountability must and will remain rigorous in my administration," [...] and that [...] "I have always stated that I want ethics and integrity to be the hallmarks of my administration. That is why I requested that the State Inspector General review the allegations with respect <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>office,</b> and that is why we have fully cooperated with both inquiries." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the October 1959 church general conference, apostle Spencer W. Kimball stated: [...] "Millions of {{you have}} blood {{relatively}} unmixed with Gentiles. Columbus called you 'Indians,' thinking he had reached the East Indies. ... The Lord calls you 'Lamanites,' a name which has a pleasant ring, {{for many of the}} grandest people ever to live upon the earth were so called. In a limited sense, the name signifies the descendants of Laman and Lemuel, sons of your first American parent, Lehi; but you undoubtedly possess also the blood of the other sons, Sam, Nephi, and Jacob. And you likely have some Jewish blood from Mulek, son of Zedekiah, king of Judah (Hel. 6:10). ... You came from Jerusalem in its days of tribulation. You are of royal blood, a loved people of the Lord. In your veins flows the blood of prophets and statesmen". Similarly, at a 1971 Lamanite Youth Conference, Kimball stated: [...] "With pride I tell those who come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>office</b> that a Lamanite is a descendant of one Lehi who left Jerusalem six hundred years before Christ and with his family crossed the mighty deep and landed in America. And Lehi and his family became the ancestors of all of the Indian and Mestizo tribes in North and South and Central America and in the islands of the sea". Ted E. Brewerton, a general authority of the LDS Church, stated in 1995: [...] "Many migratory groups came to the Americas, but none was as important as the three mentioned in the Book of Mormon. The blood of these people flows in the veins of the Blackfoot and the Blood Indians of Alberta, Canada; in the Navajo and the Apache of the American Southwest; the Inca of western South America; the Aztec of Mexico; the Maya of Guatemala; and in other native American groups in the Western Hemisphere and the Pacific islands".|$|E
