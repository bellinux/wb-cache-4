500|$|During {{his time}} at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller {{received}} a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton. British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, [...] "I remember Bill and Frank Aller <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and {{talking to me about}} the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things". He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{possible}} her change in political leanings {{was the result}} of the social upheavals occurring in American society at the same time. Beginning in the late 1950s and continuing into the 1970s, the struggle of African-Americans for social and legal equality could not have escaped the notice of a woman always known for approaching everyone she first met with respect, without regard for station in life. As an example of her attitudes on race, in 1965 her black chauffeur Richard Turner, who was also one of her best friends, was driving Alice to an appointment. During the trip, Turner pulled out in front of a taxi, and the driver got out and demanded to know of Turner, [...] "What do you think you're doing, you black bastard?" [...] Turner took the insult calmly, but Alice did not and told the taxi driver, [...] "He's <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> my destination, you white son of a bitch!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Schwarzenegger took to {{visiting a}} gym in Graz, {{where he also}} frequented the local movie theaters to see {{bodybuilding}} idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: [...] "As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed {{me a sense of}} what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve." [...] In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. [...] "It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look {{at myself in the mirror}} the next morning if I didn't do it." [...] When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: [...] "I was very young, but I remember my father <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|Williams told MTV {{that she}} couldn't [...] "wait {{for the world}} to hear [...] new solo album", {{describing}} it as [...] "fresher", [...] "more inspirational", and [...] "more on the secular side". Furthermore, she stated [...] "whether it's gospel or not, I wrote about it", therefore expecting [...] "some of her gospel fans to be a little upset" [...] but wanted to [...] "keep it real". She also discussed one of the album's [...] "primary themes" [...] – [...] "what it's like to be in love" [...] – explaining [...] " [...] mistakes you make when you're in love and how they affect your life" [...] after saying [...] "I was able to experience some things this year and I wrote about them." [...] In describing the album during another interview, this time for GospelCity, Williams said [...] "these songs are just about the real me" [...] and that she [...] "just wrote from [...] heart" [...] before acknowledging that [...] "it didn't turn out to be as 'gospel-ly' as some would have liked", but [...] "the stuff" [...] that's on the album [...] "is stuff [...] went through". Williams then said [...] "this whole album is about God's love and me". After being asked [...] "Michelle, as people listen to the album, Do You Know, as they get acquainted with the songs, what are you hoping to bring to their lives?", Williams responded [...] "That everybody live in peace and not settle for anything less than what the Lord wants to bring your way. I know what I went through, I know God is <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> another level. I had people around me that were not going where I was going – I had to release them from my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not sure, Louis," [...] I said, [...] "that I do {{not believe}} that you had some object in <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the Cafe des Deux Epingles that night. Be honest with me. I can be a friend. I have {{influence}} here and there, and, as I think you know, I love adventures. Tell me what you know of this affair. Tell me if you had any motive in <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the Cafe des Deux Epingles that night?" ...|$|E
60|$|Horrod led me {{upstairs and}} I {{realized}} that he was <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the tower in the east wing, in which I had observed a light.|$|E
60|$|Instead of <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> Rutherford Street, Mr. Jay led <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the Strand. He {{stopped at}} a dingy, disreputable-looking house, which, {{according}} to the inscription over the door, was a newspaper office, but which, in my judgment, had all the external appearance of a place devoted to the reception of stolen goods.|$|R
60|$|And he equally harassed Eustace {{the next}} morning with {{representations}} of the folly of <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> away <b>to</b> Holland, and breaking off the advantageous Poligny match, to gratify my headstrong opposition and desire for a mesalliance, which would now happily be impossible, the fellow having ruined himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{that more}} {{peaceful}} state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight, coming <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> out <b>to</b> show <b>me</b> {{that the home}} of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active, cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all." ...|$|R
60|$|ANNA--[With a faint {{trace of}} a smile.] Excuse me. You ain't used to such language, I know. [Mockingly.] That's what your <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> sea has done for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Milly, Mr. Burton's <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{the theatre}} to-night. Why don't you get Mr. Waddington to come along? We can both get a night {{off if you}} make up to the {{governor}} for a bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fred," [...] he said, [...] "do you {{remember}} <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{dinner at the}} 'Ambassador's,' one evening last September, to meet {{a girl who was}} singing there? Hamilton and Drummond and his lot were with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{perceive}} Nature, here {{in sight}} of the sea, is <b>taking</b> advantage of <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> [...] dart upon me, and sting me, Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "These pictures," [...] {{explained}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the landlady, an old, haggard- looking woman, [...] "will not be left, I am <b>taking</b> {{them with}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> London. They {{are all the}} work of my husband. He is arranging an exhibition." ...|$|R
5000|$|The 1937 film Oh, Mr Porter! {{starring}} Will Hay {{was clearly}} {{at least in}} part inspired by the song [...] "Oh! Mr Porter". Hay's character is called Mr William Porter; although he is not in fact a railway porter, but the stationmaster of a Northern Irish station; this leads to some confusion, typical of Hay's films. A snatch of the song can be heard over the opening credits although this version says, [...] "I want to go to Birmingham, and they're <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> on <b>to</b> Crewe! Oh, Mr Porter! What a funny man you are!" ...|$|R
60|$|I FIND it {{impossible}} to describe my sensations while the carriage was <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Major Fitz-David's house. I doubt, indeed, if I really felt or thought at all, in the true sense of those words.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I've kept {{everything}} waiting," [...] said Mary Gray apologetically, [...] "and now we {{must really}} say good-bye. Innocent is <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> his aunt's over at Hampstead, and I'm afraid she goes to bed early." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I have, and I'm {{very much}} obliged {{to you for}} <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the theatre," [...] I added. After all, perhaps I was misjudging him. What {{possible}} motive could he have for being my enemy? ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{perceive}} I {{have not}} really understood any thing, not a single [...] object, and that no man ever can, [...] Nature here in sight of the sea <b>taking</b> advantage of <b>me</b> <b>to</b> dart upon [...] me and sting me, [...] Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all.|$|R
5000|$|As he bled Tojo {{began to}} talk, and two Japanese reporters {{recorded}} his words: [...] "I am very sorry it is <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> so long <b>to</b> die. The Greater East Asia War was justified and righteous. I am {{very sorry for}} the nation and all the races of the Greater Asiatic powers. I wait for the righteous judgment of history. I wished to commit suicide but sometimes that fails." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Betteredge, {{ask your}} {{daughter}} to step up. Stop!" [...] says the Sergeant, <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> away <b>to</b> the window, out of earshot, [...] "Your Superintendent here," [...] he went on, in a whisper, [...] "has made a pretty full report <b>to</b> <b>me</b> of {{the manner in}} which he has managed this case. Among other things, he has, by his own confession, set the servants' backs up. It's very important to smooth them down again. Tell your daughter, and tell the rest of them, these two things, with my compliments: First, that I have no evidence before me, yet, that the Diamond has been stolen; I only know that the Diamond has been lost. Second, that my business here with the servants is simply to ask them to lay their heads together and help <b>me</b> <b>to</b> find it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Before {{he could}} answer, and quite {{before the judge}} could reach the tragical group, she had flung her arms round Boyne's neck, and was kissing his tear-drabbled face, while he lamented back, [...] "They're <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> prison." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{continued}} she, with still {{a little}} of reproach in her tone, [...] "what {{was the use of}} <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see my darling father at all, if this is all that is to come of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{am really}} she," [...] replied Madeline. [...] "My train was late, {{and for some}} reason Alfred did not meet me. Mr.--Mr. Stewart saw fit to bring me to you instead of <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a hotel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{have got}} out,' I answered, <b>taking</b> it upon <b>me</b> <b>to</b> speak for my fellow-culprit, the Hindu--as {{he was to}} all seeming. 'The logic of facts is with us. We were booked through to Edinburgh, {{but we wanted to}} stop at Dunbar; and as the train {{happened}} to pull up, we thought we needn't waste time by going on all that way and then coming back again.' ...|$|R
60|$|Indeed, I was so weary {{that it took}} {{an effort}} to lift my hand. A strange {{lassitude}} made me indifferent. But Herky's calm mention of <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> Holston changed {{the color of my}} mood. I began to feel more cheerful. The meal we ate was scant enough--biscuits and steaks of broiled venison with a pinch of salt; but, starved as we were, it was more than satisfactory. Herky and Bill were absurdly eager <b>to</b> serve <b>me.</b> Even Bud was kind <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> though he still wore conspicuously over his forehead the big bruise I had given him. After I had eaten I began to gain strength. But my face was puffed from the heat, my injured arm was stiff and sore, and my legs seemed never to have been used before.|$|R
60|$|The {{story of}} those three men, if the reader will be content <b>to</b> have <b>me</b> give it in their own persons, without <b>taking</b> upon <b>me</b> <b>to</b> either vouch the {{particulars}} or answer for any mistakes, I shall give as distinctly as I can, believing the history {{will be a very}} good pattern for any poor man to follow in case the like public desolation should happen here. And if there may be no such occasion, (which God of his infinite mercy grant us!) still the story may have its uses so many ways as that it will, I hope, never be said that the relating has been unprofitable.|$|R
6000|$|Harris {{followed}} quickly, stumbling {{across the}} rocks. [...] "Fine," [...] he said. [...] "Thanks a lot. I'm very interested {{to meet these}} Pipers. Where are you <b>taking</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> your village? How much time do we have before nightfall?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Thumble hesitated, {{and then}} made a renewed request. [...] "If you would not mind <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Silverbridge, I could get home from thence by railway; and perhaps you would allow your servant to take the horse to Barchester." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{the use of}} that, when Captain Gordon {{will not}} let me go near you. <b>Taking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> that abominable Maplewood last Easter, with half the house shut up, and all horrid! And he is as dry as a stick!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I think I'll leave now, Georgey. You've trumped my ace, yah know. Nasty {{trick of}} White {{to go and}} round on a fellah. I don't like the turn this {{business}} is <b>taking.</b> Seems <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the only way I have left {{to get out of}} it is--to turn Queen's evidence.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But don't take a firelock, Repton. The sergeants {{would be}} sure to notice {{that there was an}} extra man. You had better join us, just as we set out. I will say a word or two to you, then do you follow on, in the dark. The men will suppose {{you are one of the}} drummers I am <b>taking</b> with <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> serve as a messenger, or {{something}} of that sort. That way you can follow close behind me, while I am posting the sentries after leaving the main body at the guardhouse. After posting the last man at the seashore, I can turn off with you for a few yards, as if giving you an order.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] {{answered}} the glover, [...] "but there were powerful reasons for--for--" [...] he withheld something which seemed upon his lips, and went on: [...] "for Conachar's father acting as he did. Well, I have played fair with him, and I do not doubt {{but he will}} act honourably by me. But Conachar's sudden leave <b>taking</b> has put <b>me</b> <b>to</b> some inconvenience. He had things under his charge. I must look through the booth." ...|$|R
