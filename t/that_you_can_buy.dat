Connecting food and agricultural production with the changing needs and aspirations of the customer provides the means to ensure competitive advantage, resilience and added value in what you produce. But market {{orientation is}} not something <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> just <b>buy</b> in or bolt on to what you do. Market orientation {{is a matter of}} changing the culture of your organisation; finding ways of learning more about your customers and understanding their needs; changing your development and reward systems to educate your employees; it may also involve significant changes to your production processes. This comprehensive collection of original research explores the challenges and opportunities associated with market orientation along the food supply chain; from the animal feed industry to meat retailing and from organic foods to old world wines. All the chapters provide exceptional insight into understanding how market orientation can benefit food suppliers and how it is essential for long-term success...|$|R
5000|$|The cartoon {{begins as}} Huey, Dewey and Louie visit their wealthy Uncle Scrooge McDuck in his bank vault and explain {{that they want}} to deposit their money, which totals a {{considerable}} $1.95. Scrooge discusses the history of money, explaining that ancient Roman soldiers were paid in salt that was called [...] "salarium," [...] which lead to the phrase [...] "worth his salt" [...] and where the word [...] "salary" [...] came from. He then adds that a Spanish piece of eight is made up of smaller [...] "bits," [...] and that ancient Greek obols were tiny enough to be carried in the mouth, thus the phrase [...] "cough up." [...] Scrooge also shows his nephews a large stone wheel from the Island of Yap and going even further back in time, he explains that earliest cavemen attempted to trade goods with one another but soon realized that they [...] "needed money," [...] or a stable standard of value at which to price different items. Many different objects were used as currency until eventually coins and paper bills were invented, and checks and credit cards came along when it became impractical to carry one's cash around at all times. When the nephews suggest simply printing [...] "a few billion more dollars," [...] Scrooge explains that a billion is actually far more than they think and that making more money would lead to dangerous inflation. He describes <b>that</b> it's what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> with what you've got is what counts, and that it's a question of economics, and how one must balance one's budget like the pieces of a pie to live comfortable, adding that income tax pays for everything from schools to roads and must be factored in as well. He clarifies that his enormous vault holds only [...] "petty cash" [...] and that money must circulate [...] "like ocean currents" [...] to keep the world moving, and advises his nephews to invest their money very wisely to make it grow. He then agrees to deposit it for them - for a 3¢ fee. Scrooge concludes that investing wisely is an art.|$|R
