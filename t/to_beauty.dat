25|$|In the {{conclusion}} of her exposition Diotima explains that men should make an ascent {{to arrive at the}} discovery of the Ideal Form of Beauty. Men should start with the love of a particular beautiful person. The next step is to pass from this particular instance <b>to</b> <b>beauty</b> in general, and from physical to moral beauty. The fourth step is to attain the love of wisdom, and then from this to the appreciation of the absolute and divine beauty (the Form of Beauty).|$|E
500|$|Wilde and aestheticism {{were both}} mercilessly caricatured and criticised in the press; the Springfield Republican, for instance, commented on Wilde's {{behaviour}} {{during his visit}} to Boston to lecture on aestheticism, suggesting that Wilde's conduct was more a bid for notoriety rather than devotion <b>to</b> <b>beauty</b> and the aesthetic. T. W. Higginson, a cleric and abolitionist, wrote in [...] "Unmanly Manhood" [...] of his general concern that Wilde, [...] "whose only distinction is that he has written a thin volume of very mediocre verse", would improperly influence the behaviour of men and women. Though his press reception was hostile, Wilde was well received in diverse settings across America; he drank whiskey with miners in Leadville, Colorado, and was fêted at the most fashionable salons in every city he visited.|$|E

500|$|After {{two centuries}} in which Monteverdi {{had been largely}} {{forgotten}} as a composer of opera, interest in his theatrical works revived in the late 19th century. A shortened version of Orfeo was performed in Berlin in 1881; {{a few years later}} the Venice score of L'incoronazione was rediscovered, leading to a surge of scholarly attention. In 1905, in Paris, the French composer Vincent d'Indy directed a concert performance of L'incoronazione, limited to [...] "the most beautiful and interesting parts of the work." [...] D'Indy's edition was published in 1908, and his version was staged at the Théâtre des Arts, Paris, on 5 February 1913, the first recorded theatrical performance of the work since 1651. The work was not received uncritically; the dramatist Romain Rolland, who had assisted d'Indy, wrote that Monteverdi had [...] "sacrifice freedom and musical beauty <b>to</b> <b>beauty</b> of line. Here we no longer have the impalpable texture of musical poetry that we admire in Orfeo." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Louise Reilly Sacco {{participated in}} a panel {{discussion}} with authorities on art and architecture about standards of beauty and ugliness in art, published in Architecture Boston. She remarked that teachers bring high school art students to MOBA, then to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA). Sacco observes, [...] "Somehow MOBA frees kids to laugh and point, {{to have their own}} opinions and argue about things. Then they take the experience to the MFA, where they might otherwise feel intimidated... Maybe the ugly... frees us." [...] Sacco believes that extreme ugliness is more striking than extreme beauty, and it forces people to think more deeply about what is wrong or misplaced. She connects this rigid judgment of what does not conform <b>to</b> <b>beauty</b> with intolerance for physical imperfections in people, noting that such rigidity sometimes causes parents to [...] "fix" [...] the perceived flaws in their children's faces to keep them from suffering later.|$|E
500|$|The {{musical score}} and songs {{featured}} in the film were composed and written by Parker and Marc Shaiman. The musical features 14 songs, each evoking a familiar Broadway style. The soundtrack also parodies many familiar Disney conventions, with several songs spoofing Disney musicals such as Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid. The tracks [...] "Mountain Town" [...] brought comparisons to Oklahoma! and the opening <b>to</b> <b>Beauty</b> and the Beast ("Belle"), and the [...] "La Resistance" [...] medley drew forth favorable Les Misérables comparisons. [...] "I'm Super" [...] recalls Beauty and the Beast [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] and South Pacific Honey Bun and [...] "Kyle's Mom's a Bitch" [...] echoes Chitty Chitty Bang Bang; [...] "Up There", [...] "I Can Change" [...] and the [...] "Mountain Town (Reprise)" [...] recalls The Little Mermaid's [...] "Part of Your World", [...] "Poor Unfortunate Souls" [...] and [...] "Part of Your World (Finale)"; and [...] "Uncle Fucka" [...] is reminiscent of Oklahoma! (especially the ending). Additionally, the song [...] "Hell Isn't Good", which accompanies Kenny's descent to Hell, is sang by James Hetfield, who went uncredited for his performance.|$|E

500|$|Wilde did {{not meet}} Walter Pater until his third year, but had been enthralled by his Studies in the History of the Renaissance, {{published}} during Wilde's final year in Trinity. Pater argued that man's sensibility <b>to</b> <b>beauty</b> should be refined above all else, and that each moment should be felt to its fullest extent. Years later, in De Profundis, Wilde called Pater's Studies... "that book that has had such a strange influence over my life". He learned tracts of the book by heart, and carried it with him on travels in later years. Pater gave Wilde his sense of almost flippant devotion to art, though it was John Ruskin who gave him a purpose for it. Ruskin despaired at the self-validating aestheticism of Pater, arguing {{that the importance of}} art lies in its potential for the betterment of society. Ruskin admired beauty, but believed it must be allied with, and applied to, moral good. When Wilde eagerly attended Ruskin's lecture series The Aesthetic and Mathematic Schools of Art in Florence, he learned about aesthetics as simply the non-mathematical elements of painting. Despite being given to neither early rising nor manual labour, Wilde volunteered for Ruskin's project to convert a swampy country lane into a smart road neatly edged with flowers.|$|E
500|$|Supervising {{animator}} Glen Keane designed Rapunzel {{under the}} tutelage of veteran animator Ollie Johnston, one of Disney's Nine Old Men. Johnston advised Keane to attempt to capture what Rapunzel is thinking as opposed to simply animating what the character is doing after reviewing one of his early pencil tests. Keane compared receiving this advice to receiving a [...] "slap that I never forgot, so when I was drawing over people's work, I really tried to get into the head of the thinking of the character". Co-director Byron Howard was inspired by the appearance of Ariel from Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989), a character who was also animated by Keane. Howard elaborated that [...] "Ariel was the first character that I ever thought there was a soul behind her eyes ... We hoped to do that with Rapunzel to find some sort of soul and depth that people could relate to". Meanwhile, Keane observed that Ariel and Rapunzel also share [...] "irrepressible" [...] spirits while encountering barriers that prevent them from pursuing their dreams. Keane was inspired by a book about the idea of feminine beauty; the book cited [...] "strangeness" [...] as [...] "the key <b>to</b> <b>beauty</b> ... in a woman's face." [...] Taking this into consideration, Keane maintained a sense of asymmetry while drawing Rapunzel, incorporating into her face several subtle imperfections, specifically her bucked teeth. The character was also drawn with freckles, making her the first Disney princess to have this feature. Keane designed Rapunzel with large eyes in order to convey her [...] "irrepressible quality", a trait her also discovered in Mandy Moore's voice. The animators created nine different versions of Rapunzel before finally settling on a design with which they were satisfied. Although Moore has observed some physical similairites between the character and herself, she maintains that Rapunzel's appearance was developed long before she became involved with the project, dismissing any similarities as [...] "coincidental".|$|E
