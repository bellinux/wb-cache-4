5|$|Although {{interest}} in the P-class ships and the battlecruiser proposal waned {{for a time in}} late 1937 and early 1938, it was quickly revived on 28 April 1938 with Hitler's public airing of his views on the 1935 Anglo-German Treaty and the consequent increased possibility of war with the United Kingdom. Calling the Naval Staff and Admiral Erich Raeder to him, Hitler laid out his thoughts of a strong navy that could pose enough danger to the British such that they would enter into an alliance with Germany rather than go to war. As decided here, Plan Z entailed two task forces each centered on three H-class battleships and one aircraft carrier, with cruisers and destroyers as escorts. In war, these forces would collaborate with the three battlecruisers by occupying convoy screens while U-boats and {{one or more of the}} O class <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> cargo-carrying merchant ships. The presence of the battlecruisers operating at large would have the secondary effect of forcing the Royal Navy to deploy battleships as convoy escorts, thus weakening any fleet that could engage the Plan Z task forces.|$|E
5|$|Walters {{was granted}} a {{permanent}} commission in the Air Force in 1930. On 5January 1931, by now promoted flight lieutenant, he won a trophy in an air obstacle race at the Cootamundra Air Pageant. In May the following year, he <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> NSW Air Derby and Evening News Cup. He temporarily commanded No.3 Squadron during October 1933, {{in the absence of}} Squadron Leader Bill Bostock. At the time, the commanding officer of No.3 Squadron also held command of RAAF Station Richmond. Walters was posted to Britain in 1936 to attend the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover, and was promoted to squadron leader in March 1937, while still overseas. He also undertook a naval reconnaissance course at RAF Manston. Returning to Australia in May, he took command of No.22 Squadron in June, flying Hawker Demons and Avro Ansons out of Richmond until February 1938.|$|E

5|$|After Darlington {{bought the}} {{railroad}} bridge from the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, {{he made his}} intentions with the five decade-old bridge clear. He <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> tracks, replacing them with a paved roadway. Darlington knew the automobile was becoming a big entity in the 1910s and 1920s, turning the bridge into a vehicular bridge was an important decision {{to make the most}} out of the crossing. He also figured that the bridge would make a good approach for drivers coming to visit the local natural attractions, such as the Delaware Water Gap and the Pocono Mountains. Darlington created new roadway approaches (Lackawanna Road and Ferry Lane) to the bridge and even two buildings on the New Jersey side of the span. One building was for toll collecting while the other was for living quarters. These quarters were soon occupied by Edward McCracken and his wife. McCracken and his wife had come from the Meyer's Ferry, a local ferry service running at that point on the Delaware since the early 18th century. McCracken had been the local ferry operator, but when a large accident occurred during a dinner break killed four passengers, the owner put the ferry under his control and later fired McCracken. Klein later sold the ferry, which Darlington bought and shut down. He immediately hired the McCrackens to work as the toll collectors.|$|E

Later, during the 1640s–50s Beaver Wars, the combined warriors of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy conquered the populous Neutrals and their peninsular territory, while the Senecas alone <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Wenro and their territory, c. 1651–1653.|$|E

Furthermore, it was the first time a team had been kept scoreless in a Grand Final since 1978.|$|E

When the Argentine ship was going to repel the enemy's boarding, the schooner <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Spanish flag and showed it was a Chilean ship, called Chileno (Chilean).
