40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{engineering}} design of a solution of a mobile robot that uses a special <b>travelling</b> <b>wheel</b> for transmission of motive power onto a surface. It further explains the principle of a vehicle <b>travelling</b> <b>wheel</b> that – according to an actual situation of the surface – changes {{the way of the}} wheel movement on the surface. The work content in our workplace is the engineering design of the solution of a mobile robot frame which uses a special <b>travelling</b> <b>wheel</b> pursuant to our patent to transfer the driving force onto the surface. This <b>travelling</b> <b>wheel</b> is able to transform and adapt to the driving conditions. Since it is an unmanned ground robot, not so common technical solutions can be used. Because it is also meant to be used in a rough terrain, the concept of four-wheel drive has been chosen and a four-wheel chassis has been designed to make it more simple. In terms of need of excellent handling and movement fluency, all four wheels will be directionally steered (4 WS) and will be placed as much in the frame corners as possible {{in order to have a}} space for 90 ° steer angle...|$|R
50|$|Motion {{ratio in}} {{suspension}} {{of a vehicle}} describes the amount of shock travel for a given amount of <b>wheel</b> <b>travel.</b> Mathematically it is the ratio of shock <b>travel</b> and <b>wheel</b> <b>travel.</b> The amount of force transmitted to the vehicle chassis reduces with increase in motion ratio. A motion ratio close to one is desired in vehicle for better ride and comfort. One should know the desired <b>wheel</b> <b>travel</b> of the vehicle before calculating motion ratio which depends much {{on the type of}} track the vehicle will run upon.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{monorail}} beam (Z 206 - 25) of Chongqing straddle monorail {{transit system}} {{was selected as}} the research object. The spatial coupling vibration model of vehicle-bridge system was established and corresponding procedure was compiled. The effect of travelling, steering and stabilizing wheel pressure respectively and typical combined wheel pressure on the system vibration was studied. The results show that the change of wheel pressure has great effect on the response of the system. The vertical response value increases with <b>travelling</b> <b>wheel</b> pressure increasing. The lateral response value increases with steering wheel pressure increasing, while the effect of stabilizing wheel pressure on the response is irregular. The effect of steering wheel pressure is greater than that of stabilizing wheel pressure on lateral responses. The effect of all of <b>travelling</b> and steering <b>wheel</b> pressure is greater than that of unilateral wheel pressure on the response. The effect tendency of stabilizing wheel pressure on the response is opposite to that of unilateral wheel pressure...|$|R

40|$|Suspension {{system is}} one of the most {{important}} subsystems in any automobile. An ideal system serves the occupant with comfort, minimal road disturbance, and thedriver with steer control and maneuverability. In the process of developing an ideal system, all the existing suspension systemsare reviewed by Pro-con analysis method, and McPherson suspension system is drawnout as most suitable system for Uniti car, as worked out from Pugh’s decision matrix. House of Quality is built to list out and prioritize technical specifications, userrequirements/ expectations for L 7 e car’s suspension. Quality Function Deploymentalso helped us to evaluate competitor strengths and weaknesses. The results obtainedfrom QFD is used as database to modify the existing predesigned McPhersonsuspension template that is available in ADAMS/Car 2015. 1. 0. Once the system wasmodified in the way it could fit the dimensions of Uniti car, it is tested and simulatedon test rig, whose results were out in the form of graphical plots between variousimportant suspension parameters. Parallel <b>wheel</b> <b>travel,</b> Opposite <b>wheel</b> <b>travel,</b> and Brake pull analysis are thetests conducted during simulation, whose results reveals that the modified suspensionsystem works efficiently for maximum working load and is stable on road to maneuvers. ...|$|R

30|$|Wheel odometry is a {{relative}} positioning technique. It suffers from position drift and inaccuracy because of wheel slippage, which leads to error accumulation over time (Fernandez and Price 2004; Nourani-Vatani et al. 2009). Translation and orientation errors in wheel odometry increase proportionally with the total <b>travelled</b> distance. <b>Wheel</b> odometry is simple and inexpensive, allows for high sampling rates, and exhibits good short-term accuracy (Borenstein et al. 1997; Aboelmagd et al. 2013).|$|R
