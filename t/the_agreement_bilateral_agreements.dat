40|$|This {{study is}} a {{comparative}} analysis of recently concluded bilateral free trade or closer economic partnership agreements including the Japan-Singapore Economic Partnership Agreement (JSEPA), the New Zealand-Singapore Closer Economic Partnership (NZSCEP), the United States- Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA), the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), and the Korea-Chile Free Trade Agreement (KCFTA). The primary objective here is to describe and analyze the structure and institutional aspects of these agreements. This paper draws out the general outlines of these bilateral accords looking into their defined principles, scope of preferences, system of rules, and other regime features. These five bilateral agreements are examined against their consistency with WTO, comprehensiveness {{defined in terms of}} the scope and depth of the agreement, the degree of flexibility defined in terms of coverage of exemptions given to members, and the level of institutionalization, referring to the organizational and implementing aspects of <b>the</b> <b>agreement.</b> <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements,</b> Japan-Philippines economic partnership, structural and institutional aspects of FTA/CEP...|$|E
40|$|Several {{existing}} nuclear-related agreements already require India and Pakistan, as members, {{to share}} information. <b>The</b> <b>agreements</b> are <b>bilateral,</b> regional, and international. Greater nuclear transparency between India and Pakistan could be promoted by first understanding the information flows required by existing agreements. This understanding {{is an essential}} step for developing projects that can incrementally advance {{the sensitivity of the}} information being shared. This paper provides a survey of existing nuclear-related agreements involving India and Pakistan, and suggests future confidence-building projects using the frameworks provided by these <b>agreements.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bilateral</b> <b>Agreement</b> on <b>the</b> Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Facilities is discussed as a basis for creating further <b>agreements</b> on restricting <b>the</b> use and deployment of nuclear weapons. The author suggests options for enhancing the value of the list of nuclear facilities exchanged annually as a part of this <b>agreement.</b> <b>The</b> International Atomic Energy Agency's regional cooperation agreement among countries in the Asia-Pacific region is an opportunity for greater subregional nuclear cooperation in South Asia. Linking <b>the</b> regional <b>agreement</b> with South Asian environmental cooperation and marine pollution protection efforts could provide a framework for projects involving Indian and Pakistani coastal nuclear facilities. Programs of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations that use nuclear techniques to increase food and crop production and optimize water management in arid areas also provide similar opportunities for nuclear cooperation. Other frameworks for nuclear cooperation originate from international conventions related to nuclear safety, transportation of nuclear wastes, worker protection against ionizing radiation, and the nondeployment of nuclear weapons in certain areas. The information shared by existing frameworks includes: laws and regulations (including internal inspection procedures that enforce compliance); lists of nuclear facilities; emergency response procedures and available resources; information related to the transportation of nuclear wastes (particularly via shipping); understanding and notification of accidental releases; and radionuclide release data from select coastal facilities. Incremental increases in the sensitivity of the information being shared could strengthen norms for Indian and Pakistani nuclear transparency. This paper suggests seven technology-based Indian and Pakistani nuclear transparency projects for consideration. Existing nuclear-related agreements provide an information-sharing framework within which the projects could occur. Eventually, as confidence increases and new agreements are negotiated, future projects could begin to deal with the accounting of fissile materials and nuclear weapons disposition and control...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the years}} efforts at finding viable {{mechanisms}} of cooperation {{for the better}} management of international migration have been pursued at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels. With the increase of international migration flows in recent decades arising from disparities in economic development among countries as well as conflict and political instability in others, {{there has been a}} resurgence of calls for strengthening dialogue and international cooperation in international migration. Types of <b>Bilateral</b> <b>Agreements.</b> <b>Bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> (BAs) have traditionally been used to manage migration flows between countries. These are formal, legally binding treaties relating to cooperation in various aspects related to labor migration. They can take <b>the</b> form of <b>bilateral</b> labor <b>agreements</b> (BLAs), <b>bilateral</b> maritime <b>agreements</b> (BMAs), <b>bilateral</b> social security <b>agreements</b> (SSAs), or anti-trafficking <b>agreements</b> (ATAs).

30|$|This {{case study}} of Atlantic Canadian ECEC is {{generally}} unsupportive of research that points to the institutional framework of Canadian federalism as being a barrier against reform in an inclusive liberal direction (Bach and Phillips [1998]; Friendly [2001 a], [2001 b]; White [2002 b]; Prentice [2006]; Friendly and White [2008]; White [2011 b]). Despite each Atlantic Canadian province receiving ostensibly similar increases to federal funding in 2005 {{coming out of the}} Bilateral Agreements-in-Principle on Early Learning and Child Care, the outcomes diverged greatly. In the case of PEI, the action of the federal government on the childcare file was superfluous to the establishment of the EYC system. The interview sample described how <b>the</b> <b>Bilateral</b> <b>Agreements</b> had resulted in only small improvements to ECEC in PEI. Rather, the implementation of an EYC system was driven by factors that were internal to PEI and took place after the federal funding from <b>the</b> <b>Bilateral</b> <b>Agreements</b> had been eliminated. In the case of Newfoundland, <b>the</b> <b>Bilateral</b> <b>Agreements</b> were not seen as pushing the ECEC system away from a neo-liberal model and in an inclusive liberal direction. However, in New Brunswick, {{and to a lesser extent}} Nova Scotia, <b>the</b> <b>Bilateral</b> <b>Agreements</b> actually provided stimulus to inclusive liberal reforms. An external stimulus from Ottawa represented an opportunity to move towards inclusive liberalism in these two provinces. On the other hand, the cancelling of funding from <b>the</b> <b>Bilateral</b> <b>Agreements</b> was also seen as halting the momentum towards further inclusive liberal ECEC reform in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.|$|R
