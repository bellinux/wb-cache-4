2500|$|The track's ambient, sparse and pitched-down {{production}} contains minor sound bursts {{and finger}} clicks, comprising percussion instrumentation, drum machines, a transparent and airy synthesizer, and minimalistic bass. Its production was noted to recall Rocky's discography, namely At.Long.Last.A$AP. According {{to the music}} sheet published at Musicnotes.com by The Royalty Network, the song is composed in the common time signature and {{is set in the}} key of F minor, having a moderate tempo of 89 beats per minute. It follows a basic sequence of Fm–A–B–Fm–E as its chord progression, except in the bridge, which has a sequence of C♯m and the lyrics [...] "Trust me, I can <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>there</b> / Trust me, I / Trust me, I / Trust me, I", and during Rocky's verse, where the chords of C, E and D are repeated in sequence. Gomez solicits a slightly raspy, deliberate, slow and breathy vocal in the song, while making use of mumbling, crooning and cooing techniques, and a plaintive timbre. Her vocal range spans the low note of C3 to the high note of B4. Her voice was compared to that of Imogen Heap, Lana Del Rey, and Lorde; she clips her enunciation and breaks her vowels on words such as [...] "good" [...] which she phrases as [...] "guh-eeed".|$|E
