40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>bridge</b> (cold bridge) {{assessment}} {{is becoming more}} important for two reasons: firstly, as legislation and energy awareness lead to increased insulation levels, so losses due to cold bridging form an increasing fraction of building heat losses; and secondly, condensation and mould growth are increasingly a focus for environmental health concern. This paper describes two recent developments aimed at improving <b>thermal</b> <b>bridge</b> assessment. The first is the EUROKOBRA <b>thermal</b> <b>bridge</b> atlas, which was developed {{with the aim of}} giving designers an easy to use, flexible, assessment tool. The second is an extension of the detailed dynamic simulation program ESP-r to 3 -D conduction capability, allowing the possibility of <b>thermal</b> <b>bridge</b> assessment within a complete building model.
