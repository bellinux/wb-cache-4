50|$|For example, in a {{case where}} a driver rear-ended another car due to faulty brakes, and is sued by the {{accident}} victim, the driver may decide <b>to</b> <b>implead</b> the repair shop where the brakes were worked on because the driver's liability derives from the repair shop's liability for their faulty repair of the brakes.|$|E
50|$|A {{defendant}} {{may also}} file a counterclaim against the plaintiff, or a cross-claim against a co-defendant, {{at any point}} before the trial begins, {{so long as the}} amount is within the jurisdictional limits of the GDC. Failure to file a counterclaim, however, does not effect a waiver of that counterclaim. A defendant may implead a third party anytime within ten days after service of process has been effected, up until the trial date, so long as the third party receives effective service of process. However, Virginia law prohibits a defendant from impleading a joint tortfeasor against whom the plaintiff is prohibited from recovering (such as plaintiff's employer in a negligent injury case, which would be covered by the state's workman's compensation). Virginia law does not recognize the doctrine of necessary and indispensable parties, so the inability <b>to</b> <b>implead</b> a party will not affect the court's jurisdiction over the case.|$|E
5000|$|This type of {{causation}} {{is often}} contrasted with substantial-factor causation. The substantial factor test is used {{when there are}} multiple negligent tortfeasors which either (1) all caused the injury, in which case any {{and all of them}} are 100% joint and severally liable (treated as the group but suing the money) and the charged defendant would have <b>to</b> <b>implead</b> or sue the others to square the damages, or (2) only one could have actually caused the injury but they were all negligent in the same way and that one cannot be determined, in which case the burden shifts and any of them that cannot show their negligence was not the cause is 100% joint and severally liable. The purpose of this is allow the aggrieved party to get their damages, and make the negligent tortfeasors square up amongst themselves. See e.g. Hill v. Edmonds, (N.Y., 1966); Anderson v. Minneapolis, St. P. & S. St. M. Ry. Co., (Minn., 1920) ...|$|E
5000|$|It is {{important}} to keep in mind that [...] "plaintiff" [...] in this context may also refer <b>to</b> an <b>impleaded</b> party. So, if a defendant impleads a party, this new party is the third-party defendant and the original defendant is the third-party plaintiff. The third-party plaintiff must file a complaint on the third-party defendant, who then must answer. The court may order a reply to this third-party defendant's answer.|$|R

40|$|An injured seaman sued his {{employer}} in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to recover damages for injuries suffered on board {{his employer}}’s vessel. The court granted the employer’s motion <b>to</b> <b>implead</b> the United States {{as a third}} party defendant. The employer claimed indemnity for any damages the seaman recovered for injuries aggravated by treatment in a United States hospital. The seaman then moved to amend his complaint to allege an action directly against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The United States objected that venue in the Southern District was improper under the act which provided that “Any civil action on a tort claim against the United States... may be prosecuted only in the judicial district where the plaintiff resides or wherein the act or omission complained of occurred. ” The seaman resided in New Jersey, and the alleged aggravation occurred in a hospital in the Eastern District of New York. Held: Motion to amend granted. The proposed amendment was not a “civil action” {{within the meaning of}} the language quoted above. It is true that if the plaintiff need not show proper venue for his suit against the third party defendant, the plaintiff is permitted to sue a person in a district which would have been improper venue for a lawsuit against that person without the impleader. If there is evidence to show that the plaintiff and the original defendant have colluded and used the impleader action to make possible the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s suit against the third party defendant which but for the impleader would have been dismissed for improper venue, then this should be grounds for requiring the plaintiff to meet venue requirements. In the absence of evidence of collusion between the plaintiff and the third party plaintiff, the result of the instant case seems justified...|$|E
40|$|In this Essay, {{we offer}} an {{integrated}} theory {{of intellectual property}} defenses. We demonstrate that all intellectual property defenses can be fitted into three conceptual categories: general, individualized and class defenses. A general defense is the inverse of a right in rem. It goes to {{the validity of the}} intellectual property right asserted by the plaintiff, and when raised successfully it relieves not only the actual defendant, but also the public at large, of the duty to comply with the plaintiff’s intellectual property right. An individualized defense, as we define it, is the inverse of an in personam right: it helps a defendant who raises it to fend off the infringement claim against her, but leaves the plaintiff’s right intact, and hence allows the plaintiff to assert it against other defendants. Class defenses form an in-between category. They can be analogized to inverse quasi-property rights in that they create an immunity zone for a certain group of users. However, group defenses do not act to invalidate the right of the plaintiff and thus the benefit to the public from a successful showing of a class defense is more limited than that arising from the vindication of general defenses. Based on this taxonomy, we show that society has a special interest in the successful raising of class and especially general defenses, as those defenses help clear the path of invalid intellectual property rights and thereby facilitate future innovation, creativity and competition. Yet, because defendants do not capture the full social benefit associated with class and general defenses, they will not invest the socially optimal level of resources in raising and litigating such defenses. As a result, some defendants will be defeated in court, while others will agree to a settlement that will keep general and class defenses unrealized to society’s detriment. As we show, this problem is exacerbated by the fact that intellectual property owners will tend to target defendants who have no wherewithal to litigate. To remedy this problem, we propose a procedural solution designed to achieve a better alignment between the private interest of intellectual property defendants and that of society at large: voluntary joinder of defendants. Specifically, we would allow defendants who raise class or general defenses <b>to</b> <b>implead</b> other potential defendants. Impleaded parties would be at liberty to decline the invitation to join. However, declining the invitation would subject the impleaded parties to one of two mechanisms. We dub the first the “preclusion mechanism” and the second the “restitution mechanism. ” Under the “preclusion mechanism,” impleaded defendants would be able to opt out instead of joining in, but if the class or general defense asserted by the actual defendant failed, they would be precluded from asserting a general or class defense in their future litigation against the same plaintiff. The impleaded defendants would thus be incentivized to form an alliance that would face the infringement suit together. Under the “restitution mechanism”—which we ultimately endorse—impleaded parties who chose to opt out would not partake of the litigation, but should the actual defendant(s) successfully raise a class or general defense, they have to pay their fair share of the cost of raising the defense as they, too, benefit from the effort...|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the central}} purpose of any {{forum non conveniens}} inquiry {{is to ensure that}} the trial is convenient, a foreign plaintiff's choice deserves less deference. The District Court's holding that the case would be better suited in Scotland was not unreasonable. First, because the {{majority}} of evidence was there and second, because the decedents were not able <b>to</b> properly <b>implead</b> the defendants. Also, Pennsylvania would not be a good venue because there would need to be two law standards - the Pennsylvania law would apply to Piper and Scottish law would apply to Hartzell. A trial involving two sets of laws would be confusing to the jury. A lack of familiarity with Scottish law would also be confusing. Another powerful reason why Pennsylvania is a bad venue is that Scotland has a very strong interest in this litigation. There is [...] "a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home." ...|$|R
