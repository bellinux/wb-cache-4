5|$|In 1972, paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould {{published}} a landmark paper developing <b>their</b> <b>theory</b> {{and called it}} punctuated equilibria. Their paper built upon Ernst Mayr's model of geographic speciation, I. Michael Lerner's theories of developmental and genetic homeostasis, and their own empirical research. Eldredge and Gould proposed {{that the degree of}} gradualism commonly attributed to Charles Darwin is virtually nonexistent in the fossil record, and that stasis dominates the history of most fossil species.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year that Brønsted and Lowry {{published}} <b>their</b> <b>theory,</b> G. N. Lewis proposed an alternative theory of acid–base reactions. The Lewis theory is based on electronic structure. A Lewis base is defined as a compound that can donate an electron pair to a Lewis acid, a compound that can accept an electron pair. Lewis's proposal gives an explanation to the Brønsted–Lowry classification in terms of electronic structure.|$|E
5|$|Much {{confusion}} {{has arisen}} over what proponents of punctuated equilibrium actually argued, what mechanisms they advocated, {{how fast the}} punctuations were, what taxonomic scale <b>their</b> <b>theory</b> applied to, how revolutionary their claims were intended to be, and how punctuated equilibrium related to other ideas like quantum evolution, saltationism, and mass extinction.|$|E

5|$|Sam Brown and W. D. Hamilton and Marco Archetti {{proposed}} that autumn leaf colour is {{a signal from}} trees to aphids and other pest species that migrate in autumn to the trees. In <b>their</b> <b>theory,</b> bright autumn coloration with pinks and yellows is costly to trees because pigments require energy to synthesize, but the investment may help them to reduce their parasite load.|$|E
5|$|Several {{improvements}} {{were made}} to image filters and <b>their</b> <b>theory</b> of operation by Otto Zobel. Zobel coined the term constant k filter (or k-type filter) to distinguish Campbell's filter from later types, notably Zobel's m-derived filter (or m-type filter). The particular problems Zobel was trying to address with these new forms were impedance matching into the end terminations and improved steepness of roll-off. These were achieved {{at the cost of}} an increase in filter circuit complexity.|$|E
5|$|The defense, {{to support}} <b>their</b> <b>theory</b> that Conley murdered Phagan in a robbery, focused on Phagan's missing purse. Conley claimed {{in court that}} he saw Frank place the purse in his office safe, {{although}} he denied having seen the purse before the trial. Another witness testified that, on the Monday after the murder, the safe was open {{and there was no}} purse in it. The significance of Phagan's torn pay envelope was disputed by both sides.|$|E

5|$|The Cretaceous–Paleogene {{boundary}} of 66 million years ago, marking the temporal {{border between the}} Cretaceous and Paleogene periods of geological time, was identified by a thin stratum of iridium-rich clay. A team led by Luis Alvarez proposed in 1980 an extraterrestrial origin for this iridium, attributing it to an asteroid or comet impact. <b>Their</b> <b>theory,</b> known as the Alvarez hypothesis, is now widely accepted to explain the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. A large buried impact crater structure with an estimated age of about 66 million years was later identified under {{what is now the}} Yucatán Peninsula (the Chicxulub crater). Dewey M. McLean and others argue that the iridium may have been of volcanic origin instead, because Earth's core is rich in iridium, and active volcanoes such as Piton de la Fournaise, in the island of Réunion, are still releasing iridium.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann bombarded uranium with neutrons, {{and noted}} that barium, a lighter element, was among the {{products}} produced. Hitherto, only the same or heavier elements had been produced by the process. In January 1939, Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch astounded the physics community with a paper that explained this result. They theorised that uranium atoms bombarded with neutrons can break into two roughly equal fragments, a process they called fission. They calculated that this {{would result in the}} release of about 200 MeV, implying an energy release orders of magnitude greater than chemical reactions, and Frisch confirmed <b>their</b> <b>theory</b> experimentally. It was soon noted by Hahn that if neutrons were released during fission, then a chain reaction was possible. French scientists, Pierre Joliot, Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski, soon verified that more than one neutron was indeed emitted per fission. In a paper co-authored with the American physicist John Wheeler, Bohr theorised that fission was more likely to occur in the uranium-235 isotope, which made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the founders}} were {{educated in the}} {{classical}} tradition, and used classical models for landmarks and buildings in Washington, D.C., to avoid the feudal and religious connotations of European architecture such as castles and cathedrals. In forming <b>their</b> <b>theory</b> of the mixed constitution, the founders looked to Athenian democracy and Roman republicanism for models, but regarded the Roman emperor as a figure of tyranny. They nonetheless adopted Roman Imperial forms such as the dome, as represented by the US Capitol and numerous state capitol buildings, to express classical ideals through architecture. Thomas Jefferson saw the Empire as a negative political lesson, but was a chief proponent of its architectural models. Jefferson's design for the Virginia State Capitol, for instance, is modelled directly from the Maison Carrée, a Gallo-Roman temple built under Augustus. The renovations of the National Mall {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century have been viewed as expressing a more overt imperialist kinship with Rome.|$|E

50|$|The {{first school}} to {{completely}} reject mercantilism was the physiocrats, who developed <b>their</b> <b>theories</b> in France. <b>Their</b> <b>theories</b> also had several important problems, and {{the replacement of}} mercantilism did not come until Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations in 1776. This book outlines the basics of what is today known as classical economics. Smith spent a considerable portion of the book rebutting the arguments of the mercantilists, though often these are simplified or exaggerated versions of mercantilist thought.|$|R
5|$|The {{production}} team envisioned Japanese cities as entities, who require physical agents to execute their will and regulate the activities within them. The concept behind {{the health of}} a city is based on traditional Chinese medicine in which the smooth flow of a body's fluids nourishes its internal organs. The team equates yōkai with qi, humans with water, and agents of the city (karas) with blood. They integrated Celtic mythology into their concept for further symbolisms, treating the city as the male (yang); and , the manifestation of its will as female (yin). In contrast, <b>their</b> <b>theory</b> treats the humans and agents as the children of the city and its will, and classifies them as the reproduction system's five major organs. Following the team's vision, the mikuras (evil yōkai) represent the five elements in this system. This idea forms the basis of the relationship between cities and their inhabitants in the show.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} presented {{witnesses who}} testified to bloodstains and {{strands of hair}} found on the lathe, to support <b>their</b> <b>theory</b> that the murder occurred on the factory's second floor in the machine room near Frank's office. The defense denied that the murder occurred on the second floor. Both sides contested the significance of physical evidence that suggested {{the place of the}} murder. Material found around Phagan's neck was shown to be present throughout the factory. The prosecution interpreted the scene in the basement to support Conley's storythat the body was carried there by elevatorwhile the defense suggested that the drag marks on the floor indicated that Conley carried the body down a ladder and then dragged it across the floor. The defense argued that Conley was the murderer and that Newt Lee helped Conley write the two murder notes. The defense brought many witnesses to support Frank's account of his movements, which indicated he did not have enough time to commit the crime.|$|E
