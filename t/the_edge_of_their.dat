5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This {{is due to the}} satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Roche spheres.|$|E
5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs along <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's {{populations of}} Alpine Woodsia and Oblong Woodsia are on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> natural ranges. The UK {{distribution}} of the former is confined to Angus, Perthshire, Argyll and north Wales, and of the latter to Angus, the Moffat Hills, north Wales and two locations in England. The plants were first identified as separate species by John Bolton in 1785 and came under severe threat from Victorian fern collectors in the mid 19th century. Cystopteris dickieana, first discovered in a sea cave in Kincardineshire, is a rare fern in a UK context whose distribution is confined to Scotland, although recent research suggests {{that it may be}} a variant of C. fragilis rather than a species in its own right.|$|E

50|$|Among {{females of}} the species, the most similar {{member of the}} genus is Parcoblatta uhleriana; females of both species have wings, but {{significantly}} reduced tegmina. Distinguishing characteristics are that female P. desertae are generally pale-colored, have elongate subtriangular tegmina, and <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> supra-anal plates form a broad, weak triangular shape at the base <b>of</b> <b>their</b> cerci, while female P. uhleriana are rust-colored to very dark, have roundly subtriangular tegmina, and <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> supra-anal plates converge in a weakly concave fashion.|$|R

5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow breeds in sparsely vegetated scrubland. Males {{attract a}} mate by singing from regular {{positions}} at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> territories throughout the breeding season. These birds are monogamous, taking only one mate at a time, and pairs often remain together for several years. If singing males come within contact of each other, they may initially raise their crowns {{and face the}} ground to display this feature; if that fails to make the other bird leave, they stiffen their body, droop their wings, raise their tails, and stick their head straight out. Males guard their territories year-round.|$|E
5|$|General Douglas MacArthur, the {{commander}} of Allied forces in the SWPA, decided on 6June to postpone the Selaru operation until after Allied forces landed in the Philippines. This was not communicated to No.80 Wing, however, and Caldwell continued to develop plans for its involvement in the Selaru operation until late August. The effective cancellation of the operation left No.80 Wing without a clear mission, and its pilots were left {{with nothing to do}} other than train. In September Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth, {{the commander}} of North-Western Area, reported to Bostock that the wing's morale could drop if it was not either given an active role or transferred to southern Australia. During the same period No.80 Wing's pilots observed that No.1 Wing's Spitfires were making occasional strafing attacks on Japanese positions in the NEI and sought approval to conduct similar operations. Caldwell did not agree to this, however, as be believed that the risks associated with flying Spitfires to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> range to attack unimportant targets outweighed any benefits to morale.|$|E

25|$|Scallops have a {{large number}} (10–100) of small (about 1mm) eyes {{arranged}} along <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mantle. These eyes represent a particular innovation among molluscs, relying on a concave, parabolic mirror of guanine crystals to focus and retro-reflect light instead of a lens as found in many other eye types. Additionally, their eyes possess a double-layered retina, the outer retina responding most strongly to light and the inner to abrupt darkness. While these eyes are unable to resolve shapes with high fidelity, the combined sensitivity of both retinas to light entering the eye and light retro-reflected from the mirror grants scallops exceptional contrast definition {{as well as the}} ability to detect changing patterns of light and motion. Scallops primarily rely on their eyes as an 'early-warning' threat detection system, scanning around them for movement and shadows which could potentially indicate predators. Additionally, some scallops alter their swimming or feeding behavior based on the turbidity or clarity of the water, by detecting the movement of particulate matter in the water column.|$|E

25|$|In warm, damp climates, H. aspersa may {{lay eggs}} {{as often as}} five times from February through October, {{depending}} on the weather and region. Mating and egg-laying begin when {{there are at least}} 10 hours of daylight and continue until days begin to get shorter. In the United States, longer hours of sunlight that occur when temperatures are still too cold will affect this schedule, but increasing hours of daylight still stimulate egg laying. If warm enough, the eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, or in 4 weeks if cooler. It takes the baby snails several more days {{to break out of the}} sealed nest and climb to the surface. In a climate similar to southern California's, H. aspersa matures in about 2 years. In central Italy, H. aspersa hatches and emerges from the soil almost exclusively in the autumn. If well fed and not overcrowded, those snails that hatch at the start of the season will reach adult size and form a lip at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> shell by the following June. If the environment is manipulated to get more early hatchlings, the size and number of snails that mature the following year will increase. In South Africa, some H. aspersa mature in 10 months, and under ideal conditions in a laboratory, some have matured in 6 to 8 months. Most of H. aspersa's reproductive activity takes place in the second year of its life.|$|E

500|$|After July 1944, No.1 Wing's combat flying {{was limited}} to {{occasional}} raids on Japanese positions. Aircraft from the wing strafed Selaroe in the Tanimbar Islands on 5September. After the raid Jeffrey told Caldwell {{that it had been}} conducted only as a means of boosting his pilots' morale. Caldwell believed that the danger of flying Spitfires to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> range in such operations outweighed the benefits which could be gained, and did not allow his pilots to participate in them. Group Captain Brian [...] "Blackjack" [...] Walker assumed command of No. 1 Wing in October; he had previously served at Darwin as No. 12 Squadron RAAF's commander. From 24 October the wing's three squadrons were all stationed at Darwin's civil airfield, which was located [...] from RAAF Station Darwin. On 27November seven Spitfires, five of which were drawn from No.549 Squadron, escorted B-25 Mitchells to Cape Lore, Timor and strafed the area before the bombers made their attack. This was the longest operational flight made by Spitfire fighters during the war.|$|E
500|$|The first {{settlement}} in the Enugu area was the small Nike village of Ogui, which was present since {{the era of the}} Atlantic Slave Trade. Nike in the Igbo language means [...] "with strength or power." [...] It was through slave raiding that the Nike people acquired most of their lands, which were mostly unsettled. The Nike used slaves for a defence strategy, placing slave camps at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> territories so that it was harder for an enemy to access the free born. The Nike people were allied to the Aro people who formed the Aro Confederacy (1690—1901) which was an Igbo organisation that controlled slave trading in the Enugu area. Along with the Aro people who came to trade from Arochukwu in the south were the Hausa people who came to trade from the north. The Hausa traders provided horses to the Nike which were used for rituals by the Igbo. Both the Aro and Hausa migrated back and forth to what is now the city of Enugu and were considered foreigners to the area.|$|E

500|$|On 28 May the {{regiment}} had to man a position just {{captured by the}} Canterbury Mounted Rifles, called No.3 Post. The 6th Squadron was chosen and started improving the trenches on arrival. Daylight was at 03:30 and although having worked all night, they had made no real impression on the position and were exposed to Turkish fire all day. However, instead of abandoning the post, at 21:00 they were relieved by the 9th Squadron. An hour later Major Selwyn Chambers, commanding the 9th Squadron reported they were surrounded by about one thousand Turkish troops. At 23:35 communications with the 9th Squadron failed. The squadron were fighting off attacks, but could not stop Turkish troops reaching <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> trench and throwing hand grenades into their positions. A troop from the 2nd Squadron, sent as reinforcements, were unable to break through. So at midnight {{the remainder of the}} 2nd Squadron attempted to reach them, but instead had to dig in to defend themselves. Even though outnumbered, both squadrons managed to hold out, [...] providing covering fire for each other. At 03:30 another Turkish attempt to capture their trenches began, this time from the south. When Turkish troops got into {{the left side of the}} 2nd Squadron trench, Major James Elmslie led a troop in a counter-attack, clearing them out. At 06:30, by using signal flags, communications with regimental headquarters were re-established. Casualties were mounting and supplies of ammunition dwindling, and the defence was becoming untenable. The 6th Squadron managed to reach the 2nd Squadron's position, but in the face of heavy Turkish fire, were unable to advance any further. Around 12:00 Turkish troops got into the 9th Squadrons trenches, forcing one troop to withdraw. After Captain Spragg of 9th Squadron located an abandoned supply of British ammunition, the New Zealanders were able to return fire at will without having to conserve ammunition. Nevertheless, the Turkish force, now numbering about three thousand men, continued their attacks all day.|$|E
