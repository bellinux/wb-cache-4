In countries with wide access to Internet services, there is less need for a radio station.

The number of fire alarms plummeted, thanks to improvements in building fire safety and fire suppression, but worsening public health and a crisis in health care availability led the public to call on DCFEMS to provide much more emergency health care. In 2002, there had fewer than 100 fire alarms per month but 8,000 to 9,000 calls for medical assistance. By 2013, the number of calls per month had risen to almost 13,350, of which about 10,700 were for emergency medical care.|$|E

40|$|The session {{initiation}} protocol (SIP) is {{a unifying}} protocol for providing integrated telephony and Internet <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> such as Web, presence, instant messaging, and chat. To {{provide for the}} integration <b>of</b> these disparate <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> considerations must be given from a network point of view. However, {{little attention has been}} given in the literature to identify the network elements required to provide these services or the mechanisms for integrating these different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> for end users. This paper describes a network-level services architecture for SIP, including network functions and entities needed to support the services integration. We will discuss how services can be incorporated at different levels in the network, and the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> typically created at each of these levels. We will also describe a service access and mediation function, which blends disparate <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> in creating a seamless and rewarding user experience. © 2002 Lucent Technologies Inc...|$|R
2500|$|The term [...] "wealth management" [...] {{occurs at}} least as early as 1933. It came into more general use in the elite retail (or [...] "Private Client") {{divisions}} of firms such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley (before the Dean Witter Reynolds merger of 1997), to distinguish those divisions' services from mass-market offerings, but has since spread throughout the financial-services industry. Family offices that had formerly served just one family opened their doors to other families, and the term Multi-family office was coined. Accounting firms and investment advisory boutiques created multi-family offices as well. Certain larger firms (UBS, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch) have [...] "tiered" [...] their platforms – with separate branch systems and advisor-training programs, distinguishing [...] "Private Wealth Management" [...] from [...] "Wealth Management", with the latter term denoting the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> but with a lower degree of customization and delivered to mass affluent clients. At Morgan Stanley, the [...] "Private Wealth Management" [...] retail division focuses on serving clients with greater than $20 million in investment assets while [...] "Global Wealth Management" [...] focuses on accounts smaller than $10 million.|$|E
