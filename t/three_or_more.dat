5|$|In most Western music, tone {{clusters}} tend to {{be heard}} as dissonant. Clusters may be performed with almost any individual instrument on which <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> notes can be played simultaneously, {{as well as by}} most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments are particularly suited to the performance of tone clusters because it is relatively easy to play multiple notes in unison on them.|$|E

Others in this group include Phil Spector (1950s, 1960s and 1970s), Quincy Jones (1960s, 1970s and 1980s), Michael Omartian (1970s, 1980s and 1990s), and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (1980s, 1990s, and 2000s).|$|E

5|$|Mimicry {{may involve}} {{numerous}} species; many harmless {{species such as}} hoverflies are Batesian mimics of strongly defended species such as wasps, while many such well-defended species form Mullerian mimicry rings, all resembling each other. Mimicry between prey species and their predators often involves <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> species.|$|E
5|$|Soap bubbles {{have very}} large surface areas {{with very little}} mass. Bubbles in pure water are unstable. The {{addition}} of surfactants, however, can have a stabilizing effect on the bubbles (see Marangoni effect). Note that surfactants actually reduce the surface tension of water {{by a factor of}} <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tessellations in <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> {{dimensions}} are called honeycombs. In three dimensions {{there is just}} one regular honeycomb, which has eight cubes at each polyhedron vertex. Similarly, in three dimensions there is just one quasiregular honeycomb, which has eight tetrahedra and six octahedra at each polyhedron vertex. However, there are many possible semiregular honeycombs in three dimensions. Uniform polyhedra can be constructed using the Wythoff construction.|$|E

5|$|The event which devastated {{areas from}} Montgomery to Greene County caused $20,000,000 in damage and injured 20 people. While the Storm Prediction Center {{archives}} {{say that it}} was a single tornado, it was likely <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> tornadoes, each producing F3 to F4 damage. Only damage near Schoharie was at the F4 level, and some sources doubt it even reached that intensity at all.|$|E

5|$|The game {{also offers}} {{objectives}} {{to be accomplished}} over multiple sessions, like making a six-letter word, or clearing <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> rows at once. This unlocks power-ups that occasionally provide opportunities such as halting the rate of new tetromino drops, and removing blocks from the screen. Up to three power-ups can be selected {{to be used in}} each game.|$|E

Occasionally, some individuals may have six, eight, or even more parathyroid glands. Rarely, the parathyroid glands may be within the thyroid gland itself, the chest, or even the thymus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Three</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> presbyteries {{formed a}} synod, which met {{annually}} and whose members consisted of ministers and ruling elders representing the presbyteries. Synods functioned as courts of appeal from the presbyteries. They {{also had the}} responsibility to ensure the presbyteries and sessions below them adhered to the church's constitution.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} studied {{variation of}} the problem involves networks of interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> of the curves meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, {{and there may be}} {{more than one way to}} continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E

5|$|A multi-star system {{consists}} {{of two or more}} gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> stars are also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit their host galaxy.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey in}} 2005 of 88 {{paediatric}} neurologists in the US found that 36% regularly prescribed the diet after <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> drugs had failed; 24% occasionally prescribed the diet {{as a last}} resort; 24% had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases; and 16% had never prescribed the diet. There are several possible explanations for this gap between evidence and clinical practice. One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained dietitians, who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.|$|E
5|$|Both the Bagabo and the Bâ€™laan {{refer to}} their agung {{ensemble}} as a tagunggo, {{a set of}} eight metal gongs suspended on a harness, which is played by two, <b>three,</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> people. Seven of the smaller-sized gongs produce a running melody with the eighth, largest gong playing syncopation with the other gongs to produce a particular rhythm. The Manabo also have an agung ensemble similar to the tagunggo, called a tagungguan.|$|E
