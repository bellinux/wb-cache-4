5|$|The initial XJ220 {{concept car}} was {{unveiled}} {{to the public}} at the 1988 British International Motor Show, held in Birmingham, England. Its positive reception prompted Jaguar to put <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>into</b> production; some 1500 deposits of £50,000 each were taken, and deliveries were planned for 1992.|$|E
5|$|Michael Armstrong {{was born}} into an Irish {{traveller}} family in Longford, Ireland. His mother went into labour with him while driving, so his partially sighted father took over the wheel but crashed <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>into</b> a lamp post {{on the way to}} the hospital; Michael was delivered in the back seat. The Armstrong family moved to Ballymun, Dublin, and, when Michael was age nine, to Manchester, England.|$|E
5|$|The gangsters/gun-runners {{who own the}} {{ammunition}} dump arrive and block {{the road in front}} of Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang. The gangsters threaten the family, but Commander Pott throws the switch which transforms <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>into</b> an aeroplane and they take off, leaving the gangsters in helpless fury. The Potts stay overnight in a hotel in Calais. While the family sleeps, the gangsters break into the children's room and kidnap them and drive off towards Paris. Chitty tracks the gangsters' route, wakes Commander and Mrs. Pott, and they drive off in pursuit.|$|E

Rock Island immediately placed <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>into</b> service on <b>the</b> Golden State, its other transcontinental train (jointly-operated with Southern Pacific).|$|R
25|$|Most {{importers}} just import {{red colour}} base cars. For {{green and blue}} taxis, the owners have to convert <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> correct colour, and they usually only paint the exterior, and people {{can still see the}} original red colour from the door gap or engine compartment.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of filming, Aston Martin {{were still in the}} final phases of {{designing}} the DBS. The scene involving the car crash was devised using an Aston Martin DB9 that was especially modified to look like Bond's Aston Martin DBS V12 and reinforced to withstand the impact. Due to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18-inch (450mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at Millbrook Proving Grounds and Adam Kirley, the stunt driver who performed the stunt, had to use an air cannon located behind the driver's seat to propel <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>into</b> a roll at the precise moment of impact. At a speed exceeding 70mph(113km/h), the car rotated seven times while being filmed, and was confirmed by the Guinness Book of Records on 5 November 2006 as a new world record.|$|E
5|$|Kevin {{travels with}} his mother in a car which breaks down. Gates arrives {{offering}} to help fix the car, and Kevin, who appears in two places at once, is able to distract him and help them escape. However, Kevin's mother, hurt by Gates, runs <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>into</b> a ditch, dying as a result. Scully tells Kevin she'll protect him. They bring him to a hotel where Scully notices an additional wound on Kevin's side. Scully becomes upset at Mulder for his unwillingness to accept {{the possibility of a}} miracle. As they talk, Gates breaks into the bathroom, kidnapping Kevin by prying an opening in the barred window. Scully returns to see Kevin's father but finds him heavily drugged.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} transport, {{they are}} {{surprised}} when three armored trucks leave Steve's mansion, but Napster is able to determine which one carries the bullion, and manipulates the traffic accordingly. Knowing that Steve is monitoring the transport by helicopter, they get {{the car to the}} target spot and then create a diversion as they detonate explosives to drop the part of the road with <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>into</b> the old subway tunnels below. Stella cracks the safe, and they load up the Coopers with the gold. They race from the subway to the Los Angeles River and through the city, pursued by Steve's henchmen on motorcycles, with Napster helping to create a green wave to evade traffic. Steve himself eventually leaves his helicopter and steals a truck to follow them to Union Station.|$|E

50|$|The hard {{economic}} crises that the post-Soviet Russia {{was faced with}} meant that GAZ had no means to launch <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>into</b> production. Originally GAZ hoped to re-launch its 3103 family nonetheless, but as the years went, and despite the economy improving, its mid-1980s exterior design became archaic.|$|R
5|$|Susan and David {{defy the}} group and go check on Mr. Griffin. The two find him dead {{as a result of}} {{coronary}} arrest after being unable to take his medication for angina. Mark convinces {{the rest of the group}} to cover up the death. He instructs Susan, who was the last one known to the police to see Mr. Griffin, to tell them Mr. Griffin kept looking at his watch during the conference and left with a pretty woman. Jeff, Mark, and David bury the body in the mountains. Betsy and David also drive Mr. Griffin's car to the airport, but the officer who gave Betsy a ticket sees her there. Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr. Griffin's, Jeff and Betsy move <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>into</b> Jeff's garage so he can repaint it before they hide it elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Alan {{discovers that}} his license has {{arrived in the}} mail. Ecstatic, he wishes to drive immediately, asking his family members if they need help with any errands. Later, Hal {{shows up at the}} Dixon home. Knowing that Alan's license had been {{scheduled}} to arrive, he begins to talk to Alan, telling him about things he should know {{in order to be able}} to drive safely. As he finishes giving the advice, Frank Jr. and Betty return home. Alan asks his father if he can drive <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>into</b> town. His father lets him, and Frank Jr. and Betty agree to go with him to make sure he arrives safely.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Aldermach Maggotbone {{is ready}} to hand over his title {{as the leader of}} Hell to his daughter, Callie. However, Callie does not want to take over his job. A {{competition}} is held to choose which one will overtake the title and Callie tries to lose every challenge, but Twayne makes sure that she wins each time. At the studio where Dishonorable Discharge was filmed, Grimes forces some bystanders to act in his ending of the series, which reveals the memory Grimes had repressed: While trying to take down Aldermach when he became the new leader of Hell, Grimes accidentally killed a disguised Jimmy. In present time, Mark, Grimes and Randall head back to New York to sabotage the new ceremony. At the ceremony, Aldermach unexpectedly chooses to give the Slitherix (a big snake one has to swallow to become the leader of Hell) to his secretary, Cathy, to spare Callie from getting the job. Just as Cathy is about to receive the snake, Grimes crashes <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>into</b> the church and shoots her. It is then revealed that she is really Grimes' old partner Jimmy, who had worked undercover in Hell for 35 years. Embarrassed, Grimes begins to repress his memories again, which Mark believes is for the best. The episode ends with an angel waking up, suggesting that the episode was her dream.|$|E

25|$|In 1934 tragedy struck. Beatriz, who was {{spending}} summer vacation in Pörtschach am Wörthersee in Austria, {{was driving a}} car with her brother Gonzalo as passenger. Trying to avoid a bicycle rider who had crossed their path, she slammed <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>into</b> a wall.

25|$|Intentional or {{accidental}} imperfection in execution. For example, {{a computer}} capable of flawless logical play facing a second flawless computer {{will result in}} equilibrium. Introduction of imperfection will lead to its disruption either through loss to the player who makes the mistake, or through negation of the common knowledge criterion leading to possible victory for the player. (An example would be a player suddenly putting <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>into</b> reverse {{in the game of}} chicken, ensuring a no-loss no-win scenario).|$|E
25|$|When the sonar park sensors {{feature is}} used, the processor(s) {{calculate}} steering angle data which are {{displayed on the}} navigation/camera touchscreen along with obstacle information. The Intelligent Parking Assist System expands on this capability and is accessible when the vehicle is shifted to reverse (which automatically activates the backup camera). When in reverse, the backup camera screen features parking buttons {{which can be used}} to activate automated parking procedures. When the Intelligent Parking Assist System is activated, the central processor calculates the optimum parallel or reverse park steering angles and then interfaces with the Electric Power Steering systems of the vehicle to guide <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>into</b> the parking spot.|$|E
25|$|Mark Webber was {{the early}} pace setter in this 15 minute knock-out, but an amazing lap by Nico Rosberg easily secured his place into Q3. Button was {{struggling}} {{all through the}} session and ran wide and almost put <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>into</b> the wall on his final lap. He eventually finished a dismal twelfth. And with Barrichello having to drop 5 places down the grid after changing his gearbox before qualifying it wasn't looking to good for Ross Brawn's team. Barrichello left it late and jumped from eleventh to sixth to book {{his place in the}} top 10 shootout. The others to be knocked out were; Nakajima (P11), Räikkönen (P13), Buemi (P14) and Trulli in P15.|$|E
