It {{departed}} Alexandria for Marseilles on 1 June 1916, to join the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. Cannan led his battalion into action again at the Battle of Pozières and Battle of Mouquet Farm. On the night of 8 August 1916, the 15th Infantry Battalion launched {{an attack on the}} German trench in front of Mouquet Farm known as Park Lane. Cannan's men captured their objectives, and indeed went beyond <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> places. However, the Suffolk Regiment on his flank was mown down by German machine gun fire and Cannan was compelled to withdraw part of his force to a more defensible position.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the three-cent nickel piece {{remained}} stable throughout its run, and there are few varieties. An overdate is known, 1887/6. The die that struck those coins was originally dated 1886, when no circulation strikes were made. So the die would not be wasted, the Mint altered the last digit from a 6 to a 7; evidence of both numbers is visible. Some 1865 pieces in proof condition display a wreath on the reverse that comes much closer to touching the rim than on later issues. These were most likely pattern coins but they are accepted as issued because the Mint placed <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> 1865 proof sets. Many of the three-cent nickel pieces were not fully struck, and are missing details of the design; {{this is because the}} head of Liberty is directly opposite the III, and the Mint had trouble getting the hard metal alloy to adequately flow to the high points of both sides.|$|E
5|$|At 14:45, {{covered by}} an {{artillery}} barrage and machine-gun fire, the Turkish troops counter-attacked again. The regiment's machine gunners returned fire {{and for a}} short time the battle became a machine-gun engagement. During this time the Wellington Mounted Rifles, to the right, had occupied a prominent hill, but were under heavy fire. To support them, the 3rd Squadron sent two troops to engage their opponents, which they caught {{in the bottom of a}} valley, with enfilade fire. Then in front of the regiment a fresh Turkish battalion was sent to assault <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>some</b> places, the Turkish force got close enough to throw hand grenades into the regiment's defences. These killed or wounded all those defending a small hill, which was then occupied by the Turkish troops, bringing indirect fire onto the rest of the regiment's positions, which by now were becoming untenable. At first, messengers sent to the 4th Squadron asking for assistance failed to get through. Eventually the squadron received the message and charged across the open ground, recapturing the hill. This brought the rest of the Turkish line into range of the squadron's guns. Confronted by the new threat, the Turkish troops retired back to their starting point. McCarroll was ordering a regiment attack on the orange grove when he was wounded in the neck and shoulder, forcing Major Henry Whitehorn to assume temporary command of the regiment. By then it was getting dark and the only Turkish offensive action was an artillery bombardment. Instead of attacking, the regiment spent the rest of the day evacuating the wounded and strengthening their lines. Their casualties during the battle were fifteen dead and seventy-four wounded. The next morning it was discovered that Ayun Kara had been evacuated by the Turkish troops.|$|E

25|$|The {{t-distribution}} {{is often}} used {{as an alternative to}} the normal distribution as a model for data, which often has heavier tails than the normal distribution allows for; see e.g. Lange et al. The classical approach was to identify outliers and exclude or downweight <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> way. However, it is not always easy to identify outliers (especially in high dimensions), and the t-distribution is a natural choice of model for such data and provides a parametric approach to robust statistics.|$|E

25|$|The Peshitta {{version of}} the Old Testament is an {{independent}} translation based largely on a Hebrew text similar to the Proto-Masoretic Text. It shows a number of linguistic and exegetical similarities to the Targumim but is no longer thought to derive from <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>some</b> passages, the translators have clearly used the Greek Septuagint. The influence of the Septuagint is particularly strong in Isaiah and the Psalms, probably due to their use in the liturgy. Most of the Deuterocanonicals are translated from the Septuagint, and the translation of Sirach {{was based on a}} Hebrew text.|$|E

The 17th century writer Geoffrey Keating claimed {{that this was an}} ancient tradition, instituted by the druids. Dousing the old fire and bringing in the new may have been a way of banishing evil, which was done at New Year festivals in many countries.|$|E

Campbell's translations of the Catholic mystical poetry by St. John of the Cross were lavishly praised by Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, who considered <b>them,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> ways, superior to the original Spanish. Campbell also wrote travel guides and children's literature. He began translating poetry from languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, and French. Among the poets he translated were Francisco de Quevedo, Fernando Pessoa, Manuel Bandeira and Rubén Darío. Some of Campbell's translations of the symbolist verse of Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud have appeared in modern anthologies.|$|E

25|$|With {{the end of}} the Iraq War and the {{drawdown}} of the War in Afghanistan, {{there was}} some question as to what to do with MRAPs, as they were designed specifically for asymmetric warfare. The Army decided they would keep <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> sort of service post-war. Of the approximately 20,000 MRAPs in service, 30 percent (6,000) will stay in brigade combat teams as troop transports and route clearance vehicles, 10 percent (2,000) will be used for training, and 60 percent (12,000) will go into storage. MRAPs are to be superseded by the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle when it enters service in 2016. It still may be used until 2022, when the JLTV is in use in sufficient numbers.|$|E

25|$|KLS is very rare, {{occurring}} {{at a rate}} of one in 14 million, which limits research into genetic factors. The condition primarily affects adolescent males, though females can also be affected and the age of onset varies. There is no known cure, and there is little evidence supporting drug treatment. Lithium has been reported to have limited effects in case reports, decreasing the length of episodes and duration between <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> patients. Stimulants have been shown to promote wakefulness during episodes, but they do not counteract cognitive symptoms or decrease the duration of episodes. The condition is named after Willi Kleine and Max Levin, who described cases of the disease in the early 20th century. It was added to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders in 1990.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1949, ABC found itself in the {{position}} of an outsider, with less coverage than two of its competing networks, CBS and NBC, even though it was on par with <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> major cities and had a headstart over its third rival at the time, the DuMont Television Network. Before the freeze ended in 1952, there were only 108 existing television stations in the United States; a few major cities (such as Boston) had only two television stations, many other cities (such as Pittsburgh and St. Louis) had only one, and still many others (such as Denver and Portland) did not yet have any television service. The result was an uneven transition period where television flourished in certain areas and network radio remained the sole source of broadcast entertainment and news in others.|$|E
25|$|Even {{the most}} festive parades usually offer some aspect {{dedicated}} to remembering victims of AIDS and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and corporate sponsors, and promoted as major tourist attractions for the cities that host <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>some</b> countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere {{in a nearby}} park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade {{can be hard to}} establish in some events, however in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.|$|E
