It was the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, initially a gravity road feeding anthracite coal downhill to the Lehigh Canal and using mule-power to return nine miles up the mountain; but, {{by the summer of}} 1829, as documented by newspapers, it regularly carried passengers.

50|$|The British {{invented the}} modern railway system and {{exported}} {{it to the}} world. They emerged from Britain's elaborate system of canals and roadways, which both used horses to haul coal for the new steam engines installed in textile factories. Britain furthermore had the engineers and entrepreneurs needed to create and finance a railway system. In 1815, George Stephenson invented the modern steam locomotive, launching a technological race: bigger, more powerful locomotives using higher and higher steam pressures. Stephenson's key innovation came when he integrated all the components of a railways system in 1825 by opening the Stockton and Darlington line. It demonstrated it was commercially feasible to have a system of usable length. London poured money into railway building—a veritable bubble, but one with permanent value. Thomas Brassey brought British railway engineering to the world, with construction crews that in the 1840s employed 75,000 men across Europe. Every nation copied the British model. Brassey expanded throughout the British Empire and Latin America. His companies invented and improved thousands of mechanical devices, and developed the science of civil engineering to build roadways, tunnels and bridges. The telegraph, although invented and developed separately, proved essential for the internal communications of the railways because it allowed slower trains to pull over as express trains raced through. Telegraphs {{made it possible to}} use a single <b>track</b> <b>for</b> <b>two-way</b> traffic, and to locate where repairs were needed. Britain had a superior financial system based in London that funded both the railways in Britain and also in many other parts of the world, including the United States, up until 1914. The boom years were 1836 and 1845-47, when Parliament authorized 8,000 miles of railways with a projected future total of £200 million; that about equalled one year of Britain's GDP. Once a charter was obtained, there was little government regulation, as laissez faire and private ownership had become accepted practices.|$|R

30|$|In this section, {{we apply}} the coalitional graph game {{framework}} to PNC-aided two-way wireless transmissions. Specifically, {{we focus on}} the scenario with a single cell involving multiple idle cellular users and D 2 D pairs within its coverage.

Therefore, D 2 D pairs occupy the spectral resources allocated to these idle cellular users, which are used as relays <b>for</b> <b>two-way</b> D 2 D data transmissions.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} the channel estimation problem <b>for</b> <b>two-way</b> multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) re-lay communication systems in frequency-selective fading environ-ments. We apply {{the method of}} superimposed channel training to estimate the individual channel state information (CSI) of the first-hop and second-hop links <b>for</b> <b>two-way</b> MIMO relay systems with frequency-selective fading channels. In this algorithm, a relay training sequence is superimposed on the received signals at the relay node to assist the estimation of the second-hop channel matrices. The optimal structure of the source and relay training sequences is derived to minimize the mean-squared error (MSE) of channel estimation. Moreover, the optimal power allocation between the source and relay training sequences is derived to improve the performance of channel estimation. Numerical examples are shown to demonstrate {{the performance of the}} proposed superimposed channel training algorithm <b>for</b> <b>two-way</b> MIMO relay systems in frequency-selective fading environments.

In this letter, we propose a transceiver design <b>for</b> <b>two-way</b> MIMO relay systems which minimizes the total network transmission power subjecting to QoS constraints expressed as upper-bounds on the mean-squared error (MSE) of the signal waveform estimation at both destinations. An iterative algorithm is developed to optimize the source, relay, and receive matrices. Simulation results demonstrate the fast convergence of the proposed algorithm...|$|R
