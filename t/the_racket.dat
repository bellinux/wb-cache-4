5|$|Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games is a {{collection}} of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. On the Wii, the events consist of using the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the remote {{in a manner similar to}} the method the separate games are played in real life; for example, swinging the Wii Remote to replicate hammer throw or pulling back the remote and tilting the Nunchuk like a bow and arrow. While the Nunchuck is required for archery, it is optional for most of the events. There are also events that are more physically demanding, such as the five running events which require rapid drumming of the controller. Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. For example, in table tennis the player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of <b>the</b> <b>racket</b> is controlled by the player. The DS game is the same in design, but due to lack of motion controls, its events are much less physically demanding than those on the Wii. For example, instead of drumming the controller, players have to quickly stroke the touchscreen.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [67]- 69) The vibrational {{modes of}} several tennis rackets, including wooden, composite, and wide-body rackets, were determined {{through the use}} of impact modal analysis and a single frequency driving/scanning technique. It was observed that the mode frequencies of <b>the</b> <b>rackets</b> made of new composite materials and of a wide-body construction had a higher stiffness than <b>the</b> traditional wooden <b>racket,</b> as well as higher modal damping. The modes were divided into two catagories: one in which the motion was dominated by the frame, and one in which the motion was dominated by the strings. The dwell time and coefficient of restitution (COR) of a tennis ball was measured for three cases: 1) for the ball being dropped onto a hard surface, 2) for the ball being dropped onto the geometric center of the strings of <b>the</b> <b>rackets</b> with their heads clamped, and 3) for the ball being dropped onto the geometric center of the strings of <b>the</b> <b>rackets</b> with their handles firmly clamped. The COR for a new ball on a hard surface was found to be about 0. 79, and decreased with increasing impact velocity. The CORs for dropping the ball on <b>the</b> <b>rackets</b> with fixed heads were found to be approximately the same for all of <b>the</b> <b>rackets,</b> in <b>the</b> range 0. 90 - 0. 93. For the clamped handle case, <b>the</b> wide-body composite <b>rackets</b> had much higher CORs than <b>the</b> other <b>rackets</b> of about 0. 55 - 0. 53. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R

Irene Hayes (Scott) is {{caught up in}} a struggle between a big-city police captain (Robert Mitchum) and a local crime boss (Robert Ryan), who resembles the real-life Bugsy Siegel. The film was released two months after the Kefauver hearings, in which Virginia Hill, a real-life femme fatale and mistress of Siegel's, denied having any knowledge of organized crime. While Irene Hayes was thought to be modeled on the smoky-voiced Hill, Scott denied the rumor.|$|E
25|$|Squash {{provides}} an excellent cardiovascular workout. In one hour of squash, a player may expend approximately 600 to 1000 food calories (3,000 to 4,000 kJ). The sport also provides a good upper and lower body workout by exercising both the legs in running around the court and the arms and torso in swinging <b>the</b> <b>racket.</b> In 2003, Forbes rated squash as the number one healthiest sport to play. However, some studies have implicated squash {{as a cause of}} possible fatal cardiac arrhythmia and argued that squash is an inappropriate form of exercise for older men with heart disease.|$|E

25|$|A volley is a shot {{returned}} to the opponent in mid-air before the ball bounces, generally performed near the net, and is usually made with a stiff-wristed punching motion {{to hit the ball}} into an open area of the opponent's court. The half volley is made by hitting the ball on the rise just after it has bounced, also generally {{in the vicinity of the}} net, and played with <b>the</b> <b>racket</b> close to the ground. The swinging volley is hit out of the air as the player approaches the net. It is an offensive shot used to take preparation time away from the opponent, as it returns the ball into the opponent's court much faster than a standard volley.|$|E
25|$|The players spin {{a racket}} {{to decide who}} serves first. This player starts the first rally by electing to serve from either {{the left or right}} service box. For a legal serve, one of the server's feet must be in the service box, not {{touching}} any part of the service box lines, as the player strikes the ball. After being struck by <b>the</b> <b>racket,</b> the ball must strike the front wall above the service line and below the out line and land in the opposite back quarter court. The receiving player can choose to volley a serve after it has hit the front wall. If the server wins the point, the two players switch sides for the following point.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match was}} between The Original Midnight Express (Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose) (accompanied by Paul E. Dangerously) and The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane) (accompanied by Jim Cornette). The match started with Eaton and Lane {{dominating}} Condrey and Rose, and Cornette interfering using his tennis racket. This continued until Eaton missed a corner attack on Rose. Condrey and Rose attacked Eaton, and attempted a Rocket Launcher. Eaton avoided it, and Lane tagged in. Lane attacked them both, and pinned Rose after a Double Goozle {{to win the}} match. After the match, Condrey, Rose and Dangerously attacked Eaton, Lane and Cornette until Eaton fought them off with <b>the</b> <b>racket.</b>|$|E

25|$|Stanger {{fell ill}} {{while he was}} aloft {{on one of his}} October sorties. He landed on a handy {{airfield}} and shut down his plane's engine before realizing he had landed on an Austro-Hungarian strip. His only chance to escape any enemy soldiers investigating <b>the</b> <b>racket</b> of an untimely landing was to restart his engine and fly away. The customary method for starting an engine was for a ground crew member to yank the propeller as a lever to crank the engine, while a pilot sat at the controls. Stanger's solution was to remove his boots and chock the landing gear tires with the footwear. He then cranked the prop, started the engine, circled about the rotating blades, clambered into the cockpit, and departed. The fate of the boots is unknown.|$|E
25|$|There {{are five}} main {{geographical}} {{regions in the}} game; Little Italy (controlled by the Corleone family), Brooklyn (controlled by the Tattaglia family), New Jersey (controlled by the Stracci family), Hell's Kitchen (controlled by the Cuneo family) and Midtown (controlled by the Barzini family). At {{the start of the}} game, the entire map is available for the player to explore, but the game encourages the player to remain in Little Italy, as it is the easiest area of which to gain control. To completely control an area, the player must extort all business and rackets owned by the other families, and take over their warehouses and hubs. Many businesses serve as fronts to rackets, which can be taken over in a similar manner to the front, although {{in the case of a}} racket, the player has the option of simply buying <b>the</b> <b>racket</b> boss out. Rackets yield more money than businesses.|$|E
25|$|Cutolo’s NCO {{became more}} {{powerful}} by encroaching and taking over other group’s territories. The NCO {{was able to}} break the circle of traditional power held by the families. Cutolo’s organisation was just too aggressive and violent to be resisted by any individual families. Other Camorra families initially were too weakened, too divided, and simply too intimidated by the NCO. He requested that if other criminal groups wanted to keep their business, they had to pay the NCO protection on all their activities, including a percentage for each carton of cigarettes smuggled into Naples. This practice {{came to be known}} as ICA (Imposta Camorra Aggiunta – or Camorristic Sale Tax), mimicking the state VAT sale tax IVA (Imposta sul Valore Aggiunto). For instance, Michele Zaza, the biggest Neapolitan cigarette smuggler, was reported to have paid the NCO more than 4 billion lire in the first three months after the imposition of <b>the</b> <b>racket.</b>|$|E

25|$|After the serve, {{the players}} take turns {{hitting the ball}} against the front wall, above the tin and below the out line. The ball may strike the side or back walls at any time, {{as long as it}} hits below the out line. It must not hit the floor after hitting <b>the</b> <b>racket</b> and before hitting the front wall. A ball landing on either the out line or the line {{along the top of the}} tin is {{considered}} to be out. After the ball hits the front wall, it is allowed to bounce once on the floor (and any number of times against the side or back walls) before a player must return it. Players may move anywhere around the court but accidental or deliberate obstruction of the other player's movements is forbidden and could result in a let or a stroke. Players typically return to the centre of the court after making a shot.|$|E
25|$|Nadal's serve was {{initially}} considered a weak {{point in his}} game, although his improvements in both first-serve points won and break points saved since 2005 have allowed him to consistently compete for and win major titles on faster surfaces. Nadal relies on the consistency of his serve to gain a strategic advantage in points, rather than going for service winners. However, before the 2010 US Open, he altered his service motion, arriving in the trophy pose earlier and pulling <b>the</b> <b>racket</b> lower during the trophy pose. Before the 2010 U.S. Open, Nadal modified his service grip to a more continental one. These two changes in his serve increased his average speed by around 10mph during the 2010 US Open, maxing out at 135mph (217km), allowing him to win more free points on his serve. However, since the 2010 US Open, Nadal's serve speed has dropped to previous levels and has again been cited as a need for improvement.|$|E
25|$|Hantuchová {{also has}} {{endorsed}} four racquet brands. She first endorsed Babolat {{from the time}} she was a junior until late 2003, then Yonex until the 2007 Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, when she started using the Prince Ozone Seven Racquets in the 2007 Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships. Photos were released from Prince giving the impression that Hantuchová, from the start of the 2011 season, will be using the Prince EXO3 Tour 100. However, she signed a deal with Volkl Tennis and then used the Volkl Power Bridge 9. Starting with the 2011 Fed Cup, she began using the Prince EXO3 Tour Team 100 again, with which she won her fourth career title. In spring of 2015, Hantuchová started using HEAD rackets and bags although <b>the</b> <b>racket</b> is not part of the current range and appears to be all black in color. During the 2015 Grass Court Season to now, Hantuchová started using the HEAD Graphene Instinct MP racket. In 2016, Hantuchová switched her racquet brand back to Babolat.|$|E
