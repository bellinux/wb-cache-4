5|$|At {{the same}} time, <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> to handle huge {{stockpiles}} of equipment, stores and supplies. Some were far {{in excess of}} the Army's needs and had to be disposed of. Hospitals still had to be run, although some were transferred to the Department of Repatriation. <b>The</b> <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> to maintain its schools and training establishments. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> to field and maintain part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Over next fifty years, operations would be conducted by the new Australian Regular Army that Sturdee created, rather than the Militia or specially enlisted expeditionary forces.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, {{due to a}} {{shrinking}} number of operational units and stepped up production, equipment shortages were {{a thing of the}} past. Indeed, <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> more equipment that it actually needed. For example, a total of 368 25pounders were required for combat and 38 for training but there were a total of 1,516 on hand. Additionally, a total of 530 2pounder and 6pounder anti-tank guns were required, but <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> 1,941, while 68 3.7inch anti-aircraft guns were needed for combat and five for training, but there were 640 pieces available. Similar surpluses existed with small arms such as the Bren, of which 9,438 were required, but there were 21,139 in the system. The situation in relation to Bren gun carriers was even more marked with only 123 of the 3,767 vehicles actually being required, due to the decreased requirements for mobility vehicles in jungle warfare.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914, {{there were}} 28,060 {{officers}} in the British Army, of which 12,738 were regular officers, the rest were in the reserves. The number of officers in <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>had</b> increased to 164,255 by November 1918. These were survivors among the 247,061 officers who had been granted a commission during the war.|$|E
50|$|Since 1947, <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>has</b> waged three wars with {{neighboring}} India, and several border skirmishes with Afghanistan. Due to Pakistan's diverse geography, <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>has</b> extensive combat {{experience in a}} variety of terrains. <b>The</b> <b>army</b> <b>has</b> maintained a strong presence in the Arab world during the Arab-Israeli Wars, aided the Coalition Forces in the first Gulf War, and {{played a major role in}} combat in the Bosnian war as well as rescuing trapped American soldiers in Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993. Recently, major joint-operations undertaken by <b>the</b> <b>army</b> include Operation Black Thunderstorm and Operation Rah-e-Nijat, against armed insurgents within Pakistan. <b>The</b> <b>army</b> <b>has</b> also been an active participant in UN peacekeeping missions.|$|R

5|$|On 2 February 1956, IX Corps {{moved from}} {{mainland}} Japan to Fort Buckner, Okinawa, where it merged with Headquarters Ryukyus Command, to form HQ RYCOM/IX Corps on 1 January 1957.

5|$|On 23 February 2004, the U.S. Army {{announced}} that {{they had decided to}} terminate all work on the Comanche program. At the time, it was stated that <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> determined that a number of upgrades would be necessary in order for the RAH-66 to be capable of surviving on the battlefield in the face of current anti-aircraft threats; however, <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> instead decided to re-direct the bulk of its funding for rotary development toward the renovation of its existing helicopter fleet of attack, utility, and reconnaissance aircraft. Specifically, the Army also had plans to reuse the funds allocated to the Comanche program to speed up development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which could also perform the scouting role intended for the vehicle. At the time of its termination, the Comanche program had reportedly spent US$6.9billion. The contract termination fees involved were estimated to total US$450–680million for the main program partners Sikorsky and Boeing.|$|E
5|$|The British {{were stunned}} {{to find that}} Washington and <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>had</b> escaped. Later in the day, August 30, the British troops {{occupied}} the American fortifications. When news of the battle reached London, it caused many festivities to take place. Bells were rung across the city, candles were lit in windows and King George III gave Howe the Order of the Bath.|$|E

5|$|A minor Army-Air Force fight {{then broke}} out about what targets {{would be used}} for the Kwajalein tests. The Army favored using its Jupiter design, fired from Johnston Atoll in the Pacific, while the Air Force {{recommended}} using Atlas fired from Vandenberg AFB in California. <b>The</b> <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> already begun converting the former Thor launchers to Jupiter when an Ad Hoc Panel formed by the Department of Defense considered the issue. On 26 May 1960 they decided in favor of Atlas, and this was made official on 29 June when the Secretary of Defense ended pad conversion and additional Jupiter production earmarked for Zeus testing.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rain}} continued, Washington {{sent a letter}} instructing General William Heath, who was at Kings Bridge between Manhattan and {{what is now the}} Bronx, to send every {{flat-bottomed}} boat and sloop without delay, in case battalions of infantry from New Jersey came to reinforce their position. At 16:00, on August 29, Washington held a meeting with his generals. Mifflin advised Washington to retreat to Manhattan while Mifflin and his Pennsylvania regiments made up the rear guard, holding the line until the rest of <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>had</b> withdrawn. The generals agreed unanimously with Mifflin that retreat was the best option and Washington had orders go out by the evening.|$|E
5|$|British General John Burgoyne moved {{south from}} the {{province}} of Quebec in June 1777 {{to gain control of}} the upper Hudson River valley. His campaign had become bogged down in difficulties following a victory at Fort Ticonderoga. Elements of <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>had</b> reached the upper Hudson as early as the end of July, but logistical and supply difficulties delayed the main army at Fort Edward. One attempt to alleviate these difficulties failed when nearly 1,000 men were killed or captured at the August 16 Battle of Bennington. Furthermore, news reached Burgoyne on August 28 that St. Leger's expedition down the Mohawk River valley had turned back after the failed Siege of Fort Stanwix.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, Herwig re-estimated the {{casualties}} for the battle. He {{wrote that the}} French Official History, , gave 213,445 French casualties in September and assumed that [...] during the Battle of the Marne. Using the German , Herwig recorded that from 1-10 September, <b>the</b> 1st <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> 13,254 casualties, <b>the</b> 2nd <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> 10,607 casualties, <b>the</b> 3rd <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> 14,987 casualties, <b>the</b> 4th <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> 9,433 casualties, <b>the</b> 5th <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> 19,434 casualties, <b>the</b> 6th <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> 21,200 casualties and <b>the</b> 7th <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> 10,164 casualties. Herwig estimated that <b>the</b> five German <b>Armies</b> from Verdun to Paris had 67,700 casualties during the battle and assumed 85,000 casualties for the French. Herwig wrote that there were 1,701 British casualties (the British Official History noted that these losses were incurred from 6-10 September). Herwig estimated 300,000 casualties for all sides at the Marne but questioned whether isolating the battle was justified.|$|R

5|$|By September 1954, the PBHistory {{agents had}} only {{managed to find}} {{a small number of}} top secret {{documents}}. Some of the documents gathered showed that government officials and communist party leaders had been able to dispose of most of the sensitive material before they left. In the period of uncertain leadership that followed Árbenz's overthrow and preceded Castillo Armas' taking power, a member of one of the ruling juntas had prevented the Comité from searching the homes of private citizens, and from arresting them, which potentially reduced the number of sensitive documents the CIA had access to. Additionally, Castillo Armas stated after taking power that the intelligence information of <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>had</b> been completely destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Equipping the Salt Wells Pilot Plant {{involved}} its own challenges. Some facilities {{had to be}} fabricated for the purpose. Some {{items were}} hard to locate, while others were in short supply in the wartime economy. The Manhattan Project's overriding priority overcame this problem. In some cases, <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> representatives at the factories where items were made who designated them for use by Project Camel. Groves felt that his fears about excessive safety were realized: reinforced concrete, blast proof doors and electrical shielding drove up costs. In the end, after 115 days, the first explosives were melted, mixed and poured on 25 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, by 1795, <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>had</b> {{already made}} itself odious, by both rumor and action, {{throughout}} France through its dependence upon the countryside of material support and its general lawlessness and undisciplined behavior. After April 1796, {{the military was}} paid in metallic value, not the worthless paper, but pay was still well in arrears. The French Directory believed that war should pay for itself and did not budget to pay, feed, and equip its troops. Thus, a campaign that would take the army out of France became increasingly urgent for both budgetary and internal security reasons.|$|E

5|$|In 1951 the Israeli army summoned {{representatives of}} the World Lutheran Church to remove {{religious}} artifacts from the orphanage church; church representatives removed bells, windows and a pipe organ, but left the heavy marble altar encased in a wooden chest. The church was then converted into a basketball arena for the soldiers. In October 2009, {{on a tour of}} the facility after <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>had</b> vacated the grounds, the provost of the Evangelical German Lutheran Church of the Redeemer noticed the chest and asked for it to be opened, exposing the altar. The Lutherans negotiated for it to be moved to the Lutheran church at Augusta Victoria Hospital, where it was inaugurated in November 2010.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Dannatt gave {{evidence}} to the Iraq Inquiry, focusing predominantly on his role as ACGS in 2002. He described an initial reluctance to commit the Army and stated that planning had been for a minimal land commitment {{and the provision of}} naval and air support to the United States. He also repeated his previous assertions that <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>had</b> been over-stretched by simultaneous operation in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006 and re-stated his view that Afghanistan was the more important for British interests. Dannatt's evidence was followed by that of his predecessor as CGS, General Sir Mike Jackson.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Ngô family {{claimed that}} <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>had</b> {{carried out the}} raids, {{something}} their U.S. allies initially believed. However, this was later debunked, and the incident prompted the United States to turn against the regime and begin exploring alternative leadership options, eventually leading to Diệm's overthrow in a coup. In South Vietnam itself, the raids stoked widespread anger. Several high-ranking public servants resigned, and university {{and high school students}} boycotted classes and staged riotous demonstrations, resulting in further mass incarcerations. As most of the students were from middle-class public service and military families, the arrests caused further upset among the Ngô family's power base.|$|E

5|$|Japan's {{rapid advance}} south had been unexpected, and the {{perceived}} threat of invasion led to a major expansion of the Australian military. By mid-1942 <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> a strength of ten infantry divisions, three armoured divisions {{and hundreds of other}} units. Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the threat of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps, which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively. However, Australia's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain these forces once the threat of invasion had passed, and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 1941, President Roosevelt {{approved}} the atomic program after he convened {{a meeting with}} Vannevar Bush and Vice President Henry A. Wallace. To control the program, he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace, Bush, Conant, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George C. Marshall. Roosevelt chose the Army to run the project rather than the Navy, because <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> more experience with management of large-scale construction projects. He also agreed to coordinate the effort {{with that of the}} British, and on 11 October he sent a message to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, suggesting that they correspond on atomic matters.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{resources}} not in short supply was petroleum oil; supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities. Considerable effort and enthusiasm was put into making use of petroleum products as a weapon of war. <b>The</b> <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> not had flame-throwers since the First World War, but a significant number were improvised from pressure greasing equipment acquired from automotive repair garages. Although limited in range, they were reasonably effective.|$|E
