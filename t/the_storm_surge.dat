5|$|In Annapolis in Anne Arundel County, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> {{surrounded}} many of {{the buildings}} at the United States Naval Academy, resulting in about $116million in damage (2003USD, ($ USD) The Annapolis Maritime Museum suffered severe damage as well, though volunteers moved artifacts to a safer location. There, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> flooded the building in 6feet (1.8m) of water, causing great damage to the floor, drywall, and electricity. About 93% of the 211,000 power customers in the county were left without electricity after the storm. FEMA estimated a damage total of up to $500million (2003USD, ($ USD) in the county.|$|E

On Montserrat, very little damage was reported. A few minor landslides occurred in rural areas; no impact was caused by them. On Nevis there was relatively little damage although the beachfront part of the Four Seasons Resort was severely damaged and was subsequently closed for an extended period. Throughout St. Kitts and Nevis, damage was estimated at $19million.|$|E
40|$|At {{the midnight}} on 29 April 1991, a cyclone {{accompanied}} with <b>storm</b> <b>surges</b> hit <b>the</b> southeast area of Bangladesh. Unfortunately, the the maximum anomaly of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>surges</b> simultaneously {{occurred at the}} spring high tide. The highest tidal level observed in Chittagong was 7. 875 m above MSL, therefore every coastal dike was overflowed by <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>surges</b> and flooding occurred at the coastal lowland and islands. The number of the dead was more than 130, 000, which was <b>the</b> fifth worst <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> disasters in <b>the</b> world since the 13 th century. After <b>the</b> 1970 <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> disasters which generated severe damages in the central of Bangladesh, construction of cyclone shelter and Cyclone Prepardness Programme (CPP) have been promoted to reduce the disaster victims. Nevertheless, these projects are not enough to be effective at the southeast area. Through the field survey, the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>surges</b> in Bengal bay and spatial distribution of human and property damages and prepardness of countermeasures are analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Based on the multi - {{temporal}} Landsat TM/ETM + data {{acquired from}} 1992 to 2001, integrated {{with a history}} of robinia pseudoacacia planted forest in the Yiqianer nature reserve of Yellow River Delta, robinia pseudoacacia planted forest changes following <b>the</b> super <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> of Sept. 1992 and Aug. 1997 are analyzed. As a whole, the total area of robinia pseudoacacia planted forest continually decreased after <b>the</b> super <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> of Sept. 1992 in the Yiqianer nature reserve. Before <b>the</b> super <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> of Sept. 1992, the total area of robinia pseudoacacia planted forest was about 307. 44 hm(2), but the total area decreased to about 176. 85 hm(2) in Oct. 1993 and 110. 34 hm(2) in Oct. 1995 after <b>the</b> super <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> of Sept. 1992. Although the total area came back to about 138. 69 hm(2) in Sept. 1996, <b>the</b> super <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> of Aug. 1997 destroyed the robinia pseudoacacia planted forests again, and its total area sharply decreased to 41. 31 hm(2) in Oct. 1997 and 34. 02 hm(2) in May 1998 and 38. 70 hm(2) in June 1999 and 29. 70 hm(2) in May 2000. Thus {{it can be seen that}} defending the robinia pseudoacacia planted forest against super <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> is very important for forest ecosystem health...|$|R

5|$|A {{moderate}} {{storm surge}} accompanied Tropical Storm Bill as it made landfall on Louisiana. In the state, the maximum reported surge was , {{and it occurred}} at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium facility in Chauvin. In Montegut, the surge breached a levee which was still damaged {{from the effects of}} Hurricane Lili 9months before. The breach flooded many homes in the town, forcing the evacuation of an entire neighborhood. As a result, 150homes in the town were damaged, with half of them severely. <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> affected numerous low-lying cities in southeastern Louisiana by flooding roadways, including the only road to Grand Isle, stranding residents and visitors. The road was opened a day after the storm as floodwaters receded. The floodwaters entered a few homes and businesses in St. Tammany Parish.

A tornado spawned by Allison touched down at Jacksonville Beach, causing minor damage when it downed power lines and flipped over vehicles. Minor crop damage was also reported.

The passage of the hurricane destroyed 150stores near the ocean and extensively damaged three hotels. Damage to the city's port was minor.|$|E
5|$|In Texas, most of {{the damage}} was due to inland flooding. Heavy {{rainfall}} of 6 to 18inches (150 to 450mm) was reported across a large swath of Texas. The heaviest measured amount was 17.4inches (426mm) near Monroe City, Texas. Rainfall amounts of two to six inches were common throughout {{the eastern part of}} the state. In total, 38 houses were flooded in southeast Texas. The freshwater flooding resulted in the evacuation of 20 families in Chambers County. 250 people had to evacuate from their homes near Abilene, Texas due to floodwater. <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> impacts were fairly minor, ranging from 3 to 5feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) above mean sea level. A portion of State Highway 87 was flooded from <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>surge,</b> although no significant property damage was reported as a result of it. Minor beach erosion and street flooding was also reported on Galveston Island. The highest wind gust on land was 51mph (82km/h) at Scholes Field.

40|$|Typhoon Chaba in 2004 made {{landfall}} on {{the southeastern}} Kyushu {{and went through}} Chugoku (western part of Japan’s Main Island) on 30 August, causing large <b>storm</b> <b>surges</b> in <b>the</b> Seto Inland Sea (SIS). The high tide records were broken at tide stations in Takamatsu and Uno Ports. We analyzed the tidal data and simulated this case with a numerical <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> model. <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>surges</b> moved eastward along {{with the passage of}} the typhoon, and it was favorably simulated. The results revealed that the wind set-up basically played a key role in causing <b>the</b> large <b>storm</b> <b>surges.</b> However, <b>the</b> maximum <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> (MSS) in Takamatsu did not occur when the typhoon was the nearest to the city, but about 2 hours later. Since the time of MSS approximately corresponds to the high spring tide time, <b>the</b> record breaking <b>storm</b> tide was observed there. Moreover, we found the SIS can be divided into 6 areas according to the characteristics of sea topography and dominant wind direction by the typhoon. We also investigated the degrees of the contribution of two main factors of <b>storm</b> <b>surges,</b> i. e. inverted barometric effect and wind set-up, in each area. As a result, it turned out that the peak times of each effect were influenced by the geographical feature, as well as the wind field and the position of the typhoon, and had different characters in each area...|$|R
