40|$|High density {{digital tape}} systems provide a {{cost-efficient}} and reliable solution for massive data backup. To maintain a competitive position against other data storage technologies, the tape industry aims to enable higher track densities and shorter data access time. The servomechanisms {{of the tape}} transport system and the head positioning system need to be improved for these purposes. This thesis investigates combined feedforward and feedback control in the tape transport dynamics and the head actuator, respectively. As the <b>tape</b> <b>winds</b> from one reel to the other, the reel radii vary due to the <b>winding</b> of the <b>tape</b> and the reel runouts. These variations can cause tension errors. As the tape is very thin, the variations between two consecutive revolutions can be considered negligible. A feedforward-inspired control scheme is developed {{to take into account}} the time-varying radius to reduce tape tension error caused by the variations in radii. In order to better align the write/read head with the desired data track, a combined feedforward/feedback control scheme to improve the tape head positioning servo system in the presence of lateral tape motion is also developed. Approximate dynamic inversion techniques and model matching methods are investigated to design the feedforward controller. The feedforward control is computed based upon an estimate of the lateral tape motion displacements (LTMDs) at the head that is calculated using measurements of the upstream and downstream lateral tape motion displacements near the head. To find the correlation between successive LTMDs, linear and polynomial regression methods are first studied. The nonlinear partial differential equation modeling tape motion in the lateral direction is then explored to solve the displacements for a short segment of tape surrounding the head using measurements of the upstream and downstream displacements as boundary conditions. The equation is discretized in the spatial domain using the finite element method (FEM) and integrated using the Wilson theta approximation. Performance and effectiveness of the controllers are demonstrated in simulations. Feasibility analysis of implementing the feedforward controller on an actual tape drive is also conducted...|$|R

Tape systems are time-varying {{because not only}} do the radii of both reels change as a result of <b>tape</b> <b>winding</b> from one reel to the other but reels also have eccentricities. We address the time-varying nature of the reel radii due to <b>tape</b> <b>winding</b> by introducing a time-varying feedforward filter for the reference input. To attenuate the periodic tension error caused by reel eccentricities, we investigate the error in previous periods and calculate the compensation input that cancels it. This input is then fed forward to the system for future periods. Simulations show that the time-varying reference input achieved from the feedforward filter leads to zero tension error if the variations in the radius are known. With unknown reel eccentricities, the feedforward compensation input reduces the tension error by about 3 orders of magnitude when the system is periodic. I...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} experimentally validated three-dimensional transient {{simulations of}} the thermal phenomena of the <b>tape</b> <b>winding</b> process, {{as well as}} a method to determine separately the heat transfer between the hot gas originating from a torch and the composite material. The computational model predicts the temperature of the incoming tape and the substrate during the winding process. Each numerical simulation is based on an explicit time integration scheme and covers the duration of the process. The simulation within each time step employs a steady-state model. This method takes into account the cyclic nonuniform heating of the material and the effect of the growing mass. The comparison of the simulation results with the experimental data shows good agreements. The experiments were performed with preconsolidated glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene tapes. The measurements were performed with infrared pyrometry. This technique can handle moving points during the entire process, and is nonintrusive.

40|$|Abstract — A tape {{system is}} {{time-varying}} as tape winds from one reel to the other. The variations in reel radii consist of two components: the nominal reel radii change due to <b>tape</b> <b>winding</b> and the reel eccentricities {{as a result}} of non-circular reels. These variations introduce disturbances in the tape tension. This paper presents a feedforward control that addresses the time-varying reel radius to regulate the tension. The algorithm is {{based on the fact that}} the change of the nominal radius is slow and hence the nominal plant in two consecutive revolutions can be considered as the same. The reel eccentricity disturbance is then repetitive in these two revolutions. We investigate the tension error in the previous revolution and calculate the compensation input that should have cancelled it. The compensation input is interpolated properly and then fed forward to the system in the current revolution. A new compensation input sequence is computed for the immediately following revolution. This computation pattern continues until the end of the <b>tape</b> <b>winding</b> process.

5000|$|The {{fundamental}} {{durability and}} reliability of DECtape was underscored when {{the design of the}} tape reel mounting hubs was changed in the early 1970s. The original machined metal hub with a retaining spring was replaced by a lower cost single-piece plastic hub with 6 flexible arms in a [...] "starfish" [...] or [...] "flower" [...] shape. When a defective batch of these new design hubs was shipped on new DECtape drives, these hubs would loosen over time. As a result, DECtape reels would fall off the drives, usually when being spun at full speed, as in an end-to-end seek. The reel of tape would fall onto the floor and roll in a straight line or circle, often unspooling and tangling the tape as it went. In spite of this horrifying spectacle, desperate users would carefully untangle that <b>tape</b> and <b>wind</b> it laboriously back onto the tape reel, then re-install it onto the hub, with a paper shim to hold the reel more tightly. The data on the mangled DECtape could often be recovered completely and copied to another tape, provided that the original tape had only been creased multiple times, and not stretched or broken. DEC quickly issued an Engineering Change Order (ECO) to replace the defective hubs, to resolve the problem.|$|R
