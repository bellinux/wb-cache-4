The building was restored by A Mowbray Green in 1938, with Oliver Messel as the interior designer. During the Bath Blitz of 25/26 April 1942, {{one of the}} retaliatory raids on England by the Baedeker Blitz following the RAF's raid on Lübeck, the Assembly Rooms were bombed and burnt out inside. After the cessation of hostilities in Europe, they were restored by Sir Albert Richardson, with work being completed in 1963. <b>The</b> <b>ballroom</b> ceiling had to be repaired after it collapsed in 1989.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, several {{properties}} on Park Lane {{were hit}} by bombs. Dudley House, at No.100, suffered major structural damage, including the destruction of <b>the</b> <b>ballroom</b> and gallery, though the building was partially restored. However, the strength of construction of the Dorchester Hotel gave it {{the reputation of being}} one of London's safest buildings, and it was a safe haven for numerous luminaries. General Dwight D. Eisenhower took a suite on the first floor in 1942, and later made it his headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Francisco Rafael was celebrating his 64th {{birthday}} {{along with}} his wife, children, and friends at Ocean House, a beachfront banquet hall owned by Hotel Marbella in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur on 18 October 2013. There were about 80 to 100 attendees at the party, including prominent businessmen, politicians, celebrities, and sport figures like former Mexican footballer Jared Borgetti and boxing champion Omar Chávez. The party also hosted a number of musical groups, including banda La Cabeña, El Mariachi de Los Cabos, and the former leading vocalist of Banda El Recodo. At around 8:00p.m. that day, a black-colored SUV entered the private property and parked near the entrance of <b>the</b> <b>ballroom.</b> In the front seats of the car, according to eye-witness reports, were two men; {{in the back seat}} was a man dressed as a clown, who descended from the vehicle and headed towards the door that led to the kitchen. Once inside <b>the</b> <b>ballroom,</b> the clown identified Francisco Rafael {{at the center of the}} room and began to walk towards him. When the clown was about 1m (3.3ft) close, he pulled out a pistol from his costume and shot him point-blank in his head and then several times more as he fell to the ground, killing him on the scene. As the former drug lord lay dead near the entrance, the assassin ran through a rear exit while the attendees yelled, fell to the ground, and hid under the tables. Four more shots were heard outside <b>the</b> <b>ballroom</b> shortly after the attack; according to eyewitnesses, the clown had done this to scare off one of Francisco Rafael's sons, who was chasing him. The suspect then fled the crime scene in the black-colored SUV and headed towards the highway.|$|E

The $100-million reconstruction project revealed 10 stained-glass windows made of opalescent glass in <b>the</b> Georgian <b>Ballroom,</b> which had been covered over by the Sheraton Corporation in 1954 when the space was converted into a dining room.|$|R
5000|$|Extensive {{structural}} {{work was done}} to keep the kitchen capable of preparing state dinners. However, the existing red and black granite countertops (from Granite, Oklahoma) installed in the early 1990s were preserved. The library's walnut paneling and moldings have been restored to both their original luster and the room's 1928 color-scheme of rich burgundy, gold and green. A Persian rug was added to <b>the</b> <b>ballroom's</b> original maple wood floor. <b>The</b> <b>ballroom's</b> windows, chandeliers and moldings were recreated to match to originals of 1928.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ballroom,</b> {{the last}} of the palace's three largest rooms, (illustrated below) was {{designed}} by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The ormolu Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to the walls and ceiling, of such richness that it has been compared with that of François de Cuvilliés' Amalienburg at Schloss Nymphenburg. The walls and doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded, coffered ceiling is supported by golden caryatids.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ballroom</b> had a sprung {{floor and}} dance band stage.

There were no festivities. The 23-year-old Alexander had a broken voice and tears in his eyes as he made the solemn declaration. He knew that the Entente and the Venizelists would hold real power and that neither his father nor his brother had renounced their claims to the throne. Constantine had informed his son that he should consider himself a regent, rather than a true monarch.|$|E

5|$|Since the 20thcentury it {{has been}} {{traditional}} for the newly crowned monarch {{and other members of}} the royal family to sit for official portraits at Buckingham Palace and appear on the balcony, from where in 1953 they watched a flypast by the Royal Air Force. During the appearance, the monarch wears the Imperial State Crown and, if there is one, the queen consort wears her consort crown. In the evening, a fireworks display is held nearby, usually in Hyde Park. In 1902, EdwardVII's illness led to the postponement of a fourteen-course banquet at Buckingham Palace. In 1953, two state banquets were held in <b>the</b> <b>ballroom</b> there, and classical music was provided by the Royal Horse Guards.|$|E
5|$|The first air-raid drills for the Berlin central {{government}} district, {{which included the}} Reich Chancellery, occurred {{in the autumn of}} 1937.
