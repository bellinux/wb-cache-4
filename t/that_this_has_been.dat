When you see <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> granted to them by us, your Worship will know that we have also conceded to other religions the right of open and free observance of their worship {{for the sake of the}} peace of our times, that each one may have the free opportunity to worship as he pleases; this regulation is made that we may not seem to detract from any dignity or any religion.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{team made}} a poor {{start in the}} final after Fraser almost stopped during the first leg, believing that a false start had {{occurred}} after mistakenly hearing a second gunshot. She finished her leg in 1 minute 4.0 seconds, almost two seconds slower than her personal best, but enough for a 2.3-second lead over the United States' Sylvia Ruuska. Swimming the second leg, Leech maintained {{the lead in the}} first 50 metres but faded in the second half and finished with a split of 1 minute 5.1 seconds; the Australian lead was thus cut to 0.9 s. Morgan dived in for the third leg and was then overhauled and passed by American Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took her head out of the water—a fundamental error—and seeing the American a body length in front, responded with a surge to regain a 0.7-second lead heading into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the margin to 2.2 seconds to secure an Australian victory in a world-record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The victory {{was the first time that}} Australia had swept the 100-metre freestyle relay and individual events for both men and women. The only other time <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> achieved was by the Americans in 1920 in Antwerp. The win would be Australia's only triumph in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Games in Athens. The victory made Morgan Australia's youngest-ever gold medallist; this record still stands.|$|E

25|$|In December 2006, Cabot {{announced}} that a mistake {{had been made in}} the front cover summary of Valentine Princess.

25|$|It {{appears from}} {{the title page}} of Johannes Bureus' runic primer that Bureus had some {{understanding}} of the staveless runes in 1611, but <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> denied by virtually all runologists. Since Bureus had not succeeded in deciphering the runes, a large poster {{with the image of}} two runestones with staveless runes was published in 1624 together with the announcement of a royal reward for the one who could decipher them. It would, however, take half a century before someone found the solution.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturing in Scotland {{has shifted}} its focus, with heavy {{industries}} such as shipbuilding and iron and steel declining in their importance and contribution to the economy. It is generally argued <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in response to increasing globalisation and competition from low cost producers across the world, which has eroded Scotland's comparative advantage in such industries over the later half of the 20th century. However, the decline in heavy industry in Scotland has been supplanted with {{the rise in the}} manufacture of lighter, less labour-intensive products such as optoelectronics, software, chemical products and derivatives as well as life sciences. The engineering and defence sectors employ around 30,000 people in Scotland. The principal companies operating in the sector include; BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Raytheon, Alexander Dennis, Thales, SELEX Galileo and Babcock. The decline of heavy industry resulted in a sectoral shift of labour. This led to smaller firms strengthening links with the academic community and substantial, industry-specific retraining programmes for the workforce.|$|E

Since their implementation in the 1980s, the goal of these has remained to [...] "break up platoons" [...] of cars by limiting the number that can enter a freeway at a time.

[...] "Bang Bang" [...] is considered {{a combination of the}} [...] "'90s Green Day sound and the 2000s Green Day lyrics". It was described as reflecting the state of confusion in today's world while one tries to figure out their position in the chaos.

Mazzara iterated that upon hearing of her husband's revelations, Lori was conflicted with several issues. [...] "All of that is going through Lori's mind. Rick murdered Shane and she did confess she had feelings for Shane. Her son {{was a part of}} it. They're all infected. Is her baby infected? We're out on the road, where is she going to give birth? What happens if the baby dies? What happens if she dies? All of these questions are going through her head. The thing that affects her most is that she played a role in Shane's death. She put those two men at odds, she whispered in Rick's ear and then she talked to Shane at the windmill. She realizes <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> over her, and in a sense she has been an active participant in Shane's death. So she can blame Rick for that, but she's horrified by her own culpability." ...|$|E

500|$|He was billeted with Alexander, who {{was working}} in Hut 8, the {{counterpart}} to Hut 6 working on German Naval Enigma. Their close friendship let them easily resolve the competing needs of their sections for the limited available bombe time. By October 1941, he was deputy head of Hut 6 under Welchman. At this time, Bletchley Park was experiencing a shortage of clerical staff which was delaying the work on Enigma, and the management of GCCS appeared unable to obtain the resources needed. This affected both Hut 6 and Hut 8, which was run by mathematician Alan Turing with Hugh Alexander as his deputy. Together, Welchman, Milner-Barry, Turing and Alexander bypassed {{the chain of command}} and wrote a memorandum directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, outlining their difficulties. It fell to Milner-Barry to deliver the message to 10 Downing Street in person, on 21 October 1941. The next day, Churchill responded, [...] "Action this day: Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> done." [...] Within a month their needs were being met.|$|E
500|$|At 11:00p.m. EDT August 26, {{approximately}} 56hours before Katrina's landfall near Buras, Louisiana, the National Hurricane Center {{had predicted}} that the Greater New Orleans area could face a direct hit by the storm. As New Orleans {{is located on the}} Mississippi River Delta and parts of the city are below sea level, a strong hurricane could have a devastating effect on the city. Previous warnings, such as the one made by the Houston Chronicle in 2001, told of a disaster that [...] "would strand 250,000people or more, and probably kill one of 10 left behind as the city drowned under 20feet of water" [...] following a severe hurricane making landfall on the city. Max Mayfield, who was then director of the National Hurricane Center at the time, indicated that the Mississippi/Louisiana area has [...] "the greatest potential for nightmare scenarios," [...] and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> known for at least the three decades he has worked at the NHC.
