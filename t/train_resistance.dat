50|$|In {{railroad}} engineering, curve {{resistance is}} a part of <b>train</b> <b>resistance,</b> namely the additional rolling resistance a train must overcome when travelling on a curved section of track. Curve resistance is typically measured in per mille, with the correct physical unit being Newton per kilo-Newton or N/kN. Older texts still use the wrong unit of kilogram-force per tonne or kgf/t, which mixes an (outdated) unit of force and a unit of mass. Sometimes also kg/t was used, which confused the resisting force with a mass.|$|E
50|$|It {{turns out}} that {{there is no need to}} know the mass of the rolling stock to find the {{specific}} <b>train</b> <b>resistance</b> in kgf/tonne. This unit is force divided by mass which is acceleration per Newton's second law. But one must multiply kilograms of force by g (gravity) to get force in the metric units of Newtons. So the specific force (the result) is the deceleration multiplied by a constant which is 1/g times a factor to account for the equivalent mass due to wheel rotation. Then this specific force in kgf/kg must be multiplied by 1000 to get kgf/tonne since a tonne is 1000 kg.|$|E

5000|$|To {{experimentally}} {{find the}} curve resistance {{of a certain}} railroad freight car with a given load on its axles (partly due to {{the weight of the}} freight) the same car was tested both on a curved track and on a straight track. The difference in measured resistance(at the same speed) was assumed to be the curve resistance. [...] To get an average for several cars of the same type, and to reduce the effect of aerodynamic drag, one may test a group of the same type of cars coupled together (a short train without a locomotive). The curved track used in the experiments was the circular test track of the National Scientific Investigation Institute of Railroad Transport (ВНИИЖТ). A single test run can find the <b>train</b> <b>resistance</b> (force) at various velocities by letting the rolling stock being tested coast down from a higher speed to a low speed, while continuously measuring the deceleration and using Newton's second law of motion (force = acceleration*mass) to find the resistance force that is causing the railroad cars to slow. [...] In such calculations, one must take into account the moment of inertia of the car wheels by adding an equivalent mass (of rotating wheels) to the mass of the train consist. Thus the effective mass of a rail car used for Newton's second law, is larger than the car mass as weighed on a car weighing scale. This additional equivalent mass is tantamount to having the mass of each wheel-axle set be located at its radius of gyration See [...] "Inertia Resistance" [...] (for automobile wheels, but it's the same formula for railroad wheels).|$|E

40|$|T H E {{fact that}} viral {{susceptibility}} changes during embryogenesis has {{been pointed out}} by both experimental embryologists and clinical practitioners, not to mention virologists working with avian material. In attempts to find the fundamental factors which make embryonic tissue susceptible or resistant to a given virus, the metabolic and proliferative rate have been considered relevant (Williamson et al, 1953; Robertson et al, 1955; Tondury, 1956). Experience accumulated in studies of the replication of various viruses in tissue culture has taught us that a high metabolic rate and active proliferation may not always enhance viral replication (Ginsberg, 1958). However, {{there seems to be}} justi-fication for the view that an injurious agent leads to more severe tissue damage when it exercises its effect upon actively proliferating tissues than when it does so at the 'resting stage'. In our previous investigations, we studied a tissue interaction system which, by making isolated mouse metanephrogenic mesenchyme differentiate into tubules, also brought in its <b>train</b> <b>resistance</b> to certain viruses (Saxen et al., 1962, 1963; Vainio et al, 1963 a, b, c).

Con-sequently we have examined the distribution of alkaline phosphatase, since several recent studies indicate a correlation between this group of enzymes and tissue interactions in embryonic organs.

40|$|The {{research}} is initiated {{with the aim}} to make the tunnel resistance estimations more accurate. Tunnel resistance is measured to calculate running times and energy consumption. From previous studies performed by Norges Statsbaner-NSB, {{it is found that}} the standard methods in Open Track and Viriato 6 simulation tools, used to measure tunnel resistance overestimate its value which leads to higher estimation of running times and energy consumption. But in reality, train experiences less resistance while crossing the tunnels. With the purpose to measure tunnel resistance more accurately, an attempt is made to develop new methodology that can eliminate the overestimation of tunnel resistance thus making the railway system more efficient. In order to establish the methodology of calculating tunnel resistance, <b>train</b> <b>resistance,</b> its types and extent to which these resistances effect train motion inside tunnels are investigated. Running resistance value changes significantly inside the tunnels mainly because of change in aerodynamics. Running resistance depends on three coefficients A, B and C and among these three coefficients, C shows more variations as it depends on aerodynamics inside the tunnel. Therefore, efforts have been made out to measure the new value of coefficient C and tunnel factor is estimated using the new value of this coefficient C. Data for the research work was gathered both from NSB and Stadler. NSB conducted the test runs on NSB Type 73 and 75 while Stadler performed the test runs only on Type 75. On the basis of available data sets, direct and velocity fitting approaches are developed for tunnel resistance calculations. Direct and velocity fitting approaches are compared with each other and also with standard Open Track and Viriato 6 methods based on tunnel factors. Results show that both the methods provide lower tunnel factors than standard values used in Open Track and Viriato 6 thus eliminating the overestimation problem. It is also found from the results that the velocity fitting method has less variations in tunnel factors for same tunnel type and provides better estimation of tunnel resistance than direct method. Therefore, tunnel factors are calculated using velocity fitting approach based on tunnel types and it ranges from 4. 1 to 7. 7 kg/m. Based on the results, it is suggested to use 7. 7 kg/m for single track tunnels with small cross-section, 6. 4 kg/m for double track tunnels with small cross-section and 4. 1 kg/m for double track tunnels with large cross-section to calculate the tunnel resistance more accurately...|$|E

However, there is a distinct lack of empirical evidence concerning the individuals’ current knowledge regarding the design and implementation of <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> programmes, together with how they acquire their information in the first place. Hence, the focus of this research is on how this knowledge is acquired as well as the students’ current knowledge of <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> programmes design. Method The research methods consisted of an in-depth review of relevant literature and the collection and analysis of empirical data. The latter is based on the findings of a self- completed “weight training” questionnaire, which was completed by the students’ (N= 40) of Queen Margaret University who perform <b>resistance</b> <b>training.</b> Thematic analysis allowed for the researcher to quantitatively analyse data, while incorporating open-ended measures, so that individuals’ could elaborate on their ideas and share perspectives.

The findings suggest that individuals acquire their knowledge of <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> through experience and by using a variety of resources.

Participants were divided into <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> (N = 10 age; 13. 5 ± 1. 00 years, height; 155. 19 ± 8. 38 cm, weight; 51. 58 ± 9. 63 kg) or gymnastics training (N = 6 age; 15. 25 ± 2. 25 years, height; 149. 23 ± 11. 91 cm, weight; 46. 52 ± 10. 22 kg) groups. The <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> group participated in a high impact <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> program twice a week on non-consecutive days for ten weeks while the gymnastics training group continued regular participation in gymnastics practice. <b>Resistance</b> <b>training</b> resulted in significant improvements in bone mineral density, power and jump height, as well as maximal strength (p ≤ 0. 05). Conclusion: Full body, high impact <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> performed on non-consecutive days, following non-linear periodization for 1. 5 to 2 hours per week for ten weeks is sufficient to obtain bone mineral density and performance improvements in competitive female adolescent gymnasts. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cardiovascular disease {{remains the}} leading cause of death in kidney {{transplant}} recipients. This pilot study examined the potential effect of aerobic <b>training</b> or <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> on vascular health and indexes of cardiovascular risk in kidney transplant recipients. Study Design: Single-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel trial. Setting & Participants: 60 participants (mean age, 54 years; 34 men) were randomly assigned to aerobic training (n = 20), <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> (n = 20), or usual care (n = 20). Participants were included if they had a kidney transplant within 12 months prior to baseline assessment. Patients were excluded if they had unstable medical conditions or had recently started regular exercise. Intervention: Aerobic <b>training</b> and <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> were delivered 3 days per week for a 12 -week period. The usual-care group received standard care. Outcomes & Measurements: Pulse wave velocity, peak oxygen uptake (Vo 2 peak), sit-to-stand 60, isometric quadriceps force, and inflammatory biomarkers were assessed at 0 and 12 weeks. Results: The anticipated 60 participants were recruited within 12 months. 46 participants completed the study (aerobic <b>training,</b> n= 13; <b>resistance</b> <b>training,</b> n= 13; and usual care, n= 20), resulting in a 23 % attrition rate. Analyses of covariance, adjusted for baseline values, age, and dialysis vintage pretransplantation, revealed significant mean differences between aerobic training and usual care in pulse wave velocity of- 2. 2 ± 0. 4 (95 % CI,- 3. 1 to- 1. 3) m/s (P < 0. 001) and between <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> and usual care of- 2. 6 ± 0. 4 (95 % CI,- 3. 4 to- 1. 7) m/s (P < 0. 001) at 12 weeks. Secondary analyses indicated significant improvements in Vo 2 peak in the aerobic training group and in Vo 2 peak, sit-to-stand 60, and isometric muscle force in the <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> group compared with usual care at 12 weeks. There were no reported adverse events, cardiovascular events, or hospitalizations as a result of the intervention. Limitations: Pilot study, small sample size, no measure of endothelial function. Conclusions: Both aerobic <b>training</b> and <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> interventions appear to be feasible and clinically beneficial in this patient population. © 2015 National Kidney Foundation, Inc...|$|R
30|$|The {{findings}} {{of the current study}} demonstrated that body weight and BMI remained stable in both groups. This is consistent with several previous studies [39 – 41], demonstrating no difference in the body habitus characteristics post ET with a longer training duration (9 – 12  months) than the present study. However, Church et al. studied the benefits of aerobic <b>training,</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>training,</b> and a combination of both on HbA 1 c in individuals with T 2 D and found that the combined training group had a decrease in mean weight compared to the control and <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> group [15]. Recently, however, Johannsen et al. found that a <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> program for 9  months decreased body weight more than aerobic exercise; the authors attributed this finding to the increase in free fatty acids [42]. From the literature in comparison to the current study, we observed that previously reported training duration assessed was typically longer although a significant change in body weight was not common.|$|R
40|$|Metabolic {{syndrome}} {{is a set}} of risk factors (abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) which increases markedly the risk of arteriosclerotic vascular disease. In subjects with frailty syndrome, aging-related loss of muscle (sarcopenia) and bone (osteoporosis) might progress to the extent that an older person loses his or her ability to live independently. Due to ongoing obesity pandemic and growing elderly population, metabolic and frailty syndromes are major emerging concerns in healthcare system. Recent studies show that <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> has remarkable beneficial effects on the musculoskeletal system including prevention and treatment of these syndromes. <b>Resistance</b> <b>training</b> has favourable effect on metabolic syndrome since it decreases fat mass including abdominal fat. It also enhances insulin sensitivity, improves glucose tolerance, and reduces blood pressure values. The combination of sarcopenia and osteoporosis is often seen in the frailty syndrome. <b>Resistance</b> <b>training</b> is probably the most effective measure to prevent and treat sarcopenia. In addition, many studies show that <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> can maintain or even increase bone mineral density. Optimal nutrition enhances the anabolic effect of <b>resistance</b> <b>training.</b> <b>Resistance</b> <b>training</b> should be a central component of public health promotion programs along with an aerobic exercise...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effects of a six week {{training}} period of combined plyometric and <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> (PRT, n = 13) or <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> alone (RT, n = 14) on fitness performance in boys (12 - 15 yr). The RT group performed static stretching exercises followed by <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> whereas the PRT group performed plyometric exercises followed by the same <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> program. The training duration per session for both groups was 90 min. At baseline and after training all participants were tested on the vertical jump, long jump, medicine ball toss, 9. 1 m sprint, pro agility shuttle run and flexibility. The PRT group made significantly (p < 0. 05) greater improvements than RT in long jump (10. 8 cm vs. 2. 2 cm), medicine ball toss (39. 1 cm vs. 17. 7 cm) and pro agility shuttle run time (- 0. 23 sec vs. - 0. 02 sec) following training. These findings suggest that the addition of plyometric <b>training</b> to a <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> program may be more beneficial than <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> and static stretching for enhancing selected measures of upper and lower body power in boy...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> is accompanied by changes within the nervous system that {{play an important role}} in the development of strength. Many elements of the nervous system exhibit the potential for adaptation in response to <b>resistance</b> <b>training,</b> including supraspinal centres, descending neural tracts, spinal circuitry and the motor end plate connections between motoneurons and muscle fibres. Yet the specific sites of adaptation along the neuraxis have seldom been identified experimentally, and much of the evidence for neural adaptations following <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> remains indirect. As a consequence of this current lack of knowledge, there exists uncertainty regarding the manner in which <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> impacts upon the control and execution of functional movements. We aim to demonstrate that <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> is likely to cause adaptations to many neural elements that are involved in the control of movement, and is therefore likely to affect movement execution during a wide range of tasks. We review a small number of experiments that provide evidence that <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> affects the way in which muscles that have been engaged during training are recruited during related movement tasks. The concepts addressed in this article represent an important new approach to research on the effects of <b>resistance</b> <b>training.</b> They are also of considerable practical importance, since most individuals perform <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> in the expectation that it will enhance their performance in-related functional tasks...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to find out the impact of high and medium {{velocity}} <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> on speed endurance among youth boys. To achieve this purpose, Forty five (n= 45) youth boys were selected as subject at random. The age of the subjects were ranged between 15 and 19 years. The selected subjects were divided into three equal groups of high <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> group, medium velocity <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> group and control group of fifteen (n= 15) each. The training groups were treated with systematic high velocity <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> and medium velocity <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> for twelve weeks duration and three sessions in a week. The speed endurance was taken as a criterion variable for this study and 150 m run test was used as a test item. The data were collected before and immediately after the training. The collected data were analyzed statistically by using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The level of confidence was fixed at 0. 05 in all aspects. The results of the study shows that the high and medium velocity <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> group have significant improvement (p ≤ 0. 05) in speed endurance as compare with the control group and the significant difference (p ≤ 0. 05) occurred between the training groups of high and medium velocity <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> groups to each other. It was further concluded that the high velocity <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> is better for improve the quality of speed endurance as compared with the medium velocity <b>resistance</b> <b>training.</b> Key words: Speed endurance, Systematic training and Youth boys...|$|R
