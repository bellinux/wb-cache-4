5|$|As {{the number}} of condors grew, {{attention}} {{began to focus on}} releasing some back into <b>the</b> <b>wild.</b> In 1988, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> in California. Only females were released, to eliminate the possibility of accidentally introducing a South American species into the United States. The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America. California condors were released in 1991 and 1992 in California, and again in 1996 in Arizona near the Grand Canyon. Though the birth rate remains low in <b>the</b> <b>wild,</b> their numbers are increasing steadily through regular releases of captive-reared adolescents.|$|E
