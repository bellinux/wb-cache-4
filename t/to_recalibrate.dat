25|$|Migratory songbirds use the Earth’s {{magnetic}} field, stars, the Sun, {{and other}} unknown cues {{to determine their}} migratory direction. An American study suggested that migratory Savannah sparrows used polarised light from an area of sky near the horizon <b>to</b> <b>recalibrate</b> their magnetic navigation system at both sunrise and sunset. This suggested that skylight polarisation patterns are the primary calibration reference for all migratory songbirds. However, it appears that birds may be responding to secondary indicators of the angle of polarisation, {{and may not be}} actually capable of directly detecting polarisation direction in the absence of these cues.|$|E

(2009), to develop robust chronologies of deposits in limestone caves through U/Th (Uranium/Thorium or U-Series) dating of soda straw stalactites. The chronology of fossil bearing deposits at Blanche Cave was further constrained with thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) U/Th dating of 17 additional soda straw stalactite samples, and results were compared <b>to</b> <b>recalibrated</b> C- 14 ages of charcoal. The {{results support the}} assertion that soda straw stalactites can provide ages close {{to the time of}} sediment deposition and may be used as reliable chronological markers, particularly for periods reaching or beyond the radiocarbon dating limit. The application of an enhanced cleaning technique facilitated the reduction of detrital Th in samples, significantly increasing age accuracy and precision. Additionally U/Th age accuracy and precision was increased through the application of site-specific measured U/Th ratios to correct for the detrital Th- 230 component in samples.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the civil service {{to act as a}} {{reservoir}} of institutional memory is central to the pragmatic task of governing. But, there is a growing body of scholarship that suggests the bureaucracy is failing at this core task. In this article we distinguish between two different ways of thinking about institutional memory: one “static” and one “dynamic”. In the former, memory is singular and held in document form, especially by files and procedures. In the latter, memories reside with people and are thus dispersed across the array of actors that make up the differentiated polity. Drawing on four policy examples from three countries we argue that a more dynamic understanding of the way institutions remember is both empirically salient and normatively desirable. We conclude that the current conceptualisation of institutional memory needs <b>to</b> be <b>recalibrated</b> <b>to</b> fit the types of policy learning practices required by modern collaborative governance...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} {{for the construction}} of high-resolution gridded fields of reference evapotranspiration for the Austrian domain on a daily time step is presented. Gridded data of minimum and maximum temperatures are used to estimate reference evapotranspiration based on the formulation of Hargreaves. The calibration constant in the Hargreaves equation is <b>recalibrated</b> <b>to</b> the Penman–Monteith equation in a monthly and station-wise assessment. This ensures, on one hand, eliminated biases of the Hargreaves approach compared to the formulation of Penman–Monteith and, on the other hand, also reduced root mean square errors and relative errors on a daily timescale. The resulting new calibration parameters are interpolated over time to a daily temporal resolution for a standard year of 365 days. The overall novelty of the approach is the use of surface elevation as the only predictor <b>to</b> estimate the <b>recalibrated</b> Hargreaves parameter in space. A third-order polynomial is fitted <b>to</b> the <b>recalibrated</b> parameters against elevation at every station which yields a statistical model for assessing these new parameters in space by using the underlying digital elevation model of the temperature fields. With these newly calibrated parameters for every day of year and every grid point, the Hargreaves method is applied to the temperature fields, yielding reference evapotranspiration for the entire grid and time period from 1961 – 2013. This approach is opening opportunities to create high-resolution reference evapotranspiration fields based only temperature observations, but being {{as close as possible to}} the estimates of the Penman–Monteith approach...|$|R
50|$|M106 {{has also}} played an {{important}} role in calibrating the cosmic distance ladder.
