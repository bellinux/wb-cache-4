40|$|Background: Nonspecific {{back pain}} {{can be defined}} as pain and discomfort, {{localized}} over below the costal margin and above the inferior gluteal folds. Such disorder are known to be a major cause of reduced work capabilities and causing substantial financial consequences and poor productivity. Occupational <b>related</b> nonspecific <b>back</b> pain is the common disorder affecting those workers performing high physical demanding task. The shipping port workers were exposed to hazardous working nature and known to be affected. Numerous study indicate that knowledge and attitude towards safety were contributing factors <b>to</b> occupational <b>related</b> <b>back</b> pain. Currently no study was conducted to determine the relationship between knowledge, attitude and occupational <b>related</b> <b>back</b> pain among them. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the prevalence of nonspecific back pain and determine the difference between knowledge and attitude toward such incident. Methods: The respondents were workers known to have nonspecific back pain. The data collection is carry out through a set of questionnaire consists of knowledge, attitudes and Nordic questionnaire on area of back pain. Results: Majority of respondents (n= 70) involve in driving and maneuver terminal crane cargo. The mean of knowledge score is 7. 49 (± 1. 20), attitude score is 5. 72 (± 1. 33) and were ranked in good and moderate respectively.

40|$|Understanding the {{relevant}} biological activity of any pharmaceutical formulation destined for human use is crucial. For vaccine-based formulations, activity must reflect the expected immune response, while for non-vaccine therapeutic agents, such as monoclonal antibodies, {{a lack of}} immune response to the formulation is desired.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveCultures {{of primary}} {{articular}} chondrocytes for studying chondrocyte biology are notoriously difficult to handle. One alternative {{is the use}} of chondrocytic cell lines. Because the HCS- 2 / 8 cells are the most widely used cell line in cartilage research, we investigated the molecular phenotype of these cells by mRNA-expression profiling. DesignMonolayers of HCS- 2 / 8 cells were cultured to sub-confluence, confluence and over-confluence; primary human chondrocytes were grown in monolayer culture and alginate-bead cultures and several other chondrocytic cell lines were cultured as monolayers. RNA was isolated and analyzed by cDNA array profiling using Affymetrix GeneChips (U 95 A/U 95 Av 2) and quantitative PCR. ResultsImportant similarities, but also remarkable differences between the HCS- 2 / 8 cells and adult human articular chondrocytes were detected: Aggrecan and several cartilage typical collagens as well as SOX 9 transcripts were strongly expressed in HCS- 2 / 8 cells, whereas HCS- 2 / 8 cells expressed hardly any chondrocyte-typical cartilage matrix degrading enzymes. Of all culturing conditions, clustering analysis showed that HCS- 2 / 8 cultured at confluence are most closely related to primary chondrocytes. ConclusionOur study confirms how careful one needs to be in choosing in vitro model systems for investigating effects of interest. The major issue of chondrocyte cell lines appears to be that they mainly proliferate and show less expression of genes of matrix synthesis and turnover. A successful approach will have to select suitable chondrocyte cell lines and to validate findings obtained using primary chondrocytes. This allows to establish a reproducible in vitro model showing the property of interest and subsequently <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> <b>back</b> the obtained results to the physiologic situation...|$|E

Retro marketing relates to the longing of the past and during the purchasing period of consumers in recent years, they have been demanding elements which related back to the lifestyle and social conditions of a past time. Thus, vis-à-vis these developments retro marketing is the best economic solution to use consumers’ wish <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> <b>back</b> to the past. In Turkey, businesses have used retro marketing in order to create a sense of “nostalgia” for its consumers. In this context, Türkan Şoray has been used by retro marketing and she has been turned into an “icon”. This is best exemplified by Koton’s advertisement campaign. The use of Türkan Şoray’s iconic image is used in a nostalgic context to pull in consumers. Thus, it was decided to conduct a study on the posters of the films in which Türkan Şoray starred in. As it is well know, film posters are important documents that transfer important social-cultural structures relating to the period they are from. The posters have been separated according to their type for evaluation purposes. According to this separation, the posters have been analyzed according to their form. Türkan Şoray’s visual presence in the film posters is very important. She is portrayed in a manner which raises admiration. Along with being a graphical presence on the poster, she is evaluated as a cultural representation tool. Through the film posters, social reality is restructured in graphical terms and the content of the film is delivered. In this context, typographic characteristics, color, body language are analyzed to reflect the social lifestyle and the symbols that are used to construct Türkan Şoray as an icon are examined...|$|E

40|$|One {{of the key}} aims {{of modern}} {{football}} shoe manufacturers {{is to find the}} balance between developing a shoe that improves performance but also minimises the risk of injury. Traction properties of the outsole play an important part in reaching this balance; high levels of traction are necessary to enable players to accelerate and change direction without slipping, but excessive traction can lead to stud fixation, a potential cause of injuries. The ability to accurately measure and assess the traction properties is essential in the design of outsoles, but appropriate test parameters need to be used in order for the assessment <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> <b>back</b> to the intended use. The {{purpose of the study was}} to develop a method to identify how the shoe interacts with the surface during realistic football movements and then to use observations from data collected to recommend appropriate test parameters. A high-speed camera system was developed to capture the motion of the shoe in both a laboratory and natural turf environment. The cameras were calibrated using the checkerboard approach and filmed at 1000 Hz. Five markers positioned on the side of the shoe were tracked using a semi-automated algorithm developed using image processing techniques. Transposition matrices were used to identify the location of individual studs on the outsole of the shoe enabling the orientation, velocity and acceleration of the shoe to be calculated. Two data collection studies took place; firstly a single-participant study in the laboratory using a force-plate to relate kinematic results to kinetic information and secondly, a larger scale data collection outside on natural turf. Three movements representing scenarios requiring high levels of traction in football were assessed; acceleration, change in direction and braking. A representative trial for each movement was selected and full post-processing analysis was carried out. Information such as the orientation of the shoe on foot-strike, translation directions and centre of rotations during the transition phase and the number of studs in contact with the surface during push-off was obtained for each movement. The period at which the player was at greatest risk of slipping was identified for each movement. The motion of the shoe during this period was used to suggest appropriate test conditions for mechanical and computational traction testing methods. The influence of the shoe-surface interaction on outsole design was also considered; with the observed translation directions and centre of rotations being used to suggest a design aiming to enhance translational traction, but minimise rotational resistance...|$|E
40|$|Diuretic {{drugs have}} been the subject of {{intensive}} investigation and speculation, owing to their importance in therapy. Since it was known that the diuretics act to inhibit the reabsorption of sodium chloride by the renal tubules, studies were aimed at elucidating the mechanism of transport of salt in the kidney and how the drugs affect it. Generally the emphasis was on active sodium transport, which was believed to be the primary process. Ussing and Ze-rahn [1] had shown that absorption of salt through frog skin is driven by active transport of sodium. The sodium transport causes a voltage which is negative outside the frog. Chloride transport is passive, driven by the voltage. In the segments of the nephron that were first studied directly by micropuncture, the mechanism of salt transport was apparently similar to that in frog skin. The most important finding was that the voltage across both proximal and distal tubules was negative in the lumen (corresponding to the outside of the frog). Later, some suggested that there might also be active chloride transport in proximal [2] and distal [3] tubules, but the conclusion was controversial and even its advocates believed that the active chloride transport, if any, was ancillary to active sodium transport. With certain notable exceptions [4, 5], investigators also believed that diuretic drugs cause natruiresis by inhibiting the active sodium transport across renal tubules. In order to analyze the actions of the drugs, their effects were tested on various nonrenal tissues such as frog skin and toad bladder that actively transport sodium and are more easily studied than are kidney tubules. The results were disappointing. The sodium-transporting tissues are not very sensitive to diuretic drugs, and, although high concentrations of the drugs have effects, these are difficult <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> <b>back</b> to the kidney. There was considerable progress in developing better diuretics, but this was empirical, based on the synthesis and testing of chemical analogues of known diuretics, and was not guided to an important extent by principles deduced from investigation of the mechanism of drug action. In addition, the studies of the action of diuretic drugs which emphasized sodium transport failed to address an important problem. Sodium transport is ubiquitous in the body, and, if it were inhibited to even a minor degree in such tissues as nerve, the result could be alarming. Therefore, how do diuretics inhibit sodium transport so extensively in the kidney and yet have so little effect elsewhere in the body?As evidenced elsewhere in this symposium, contemporary studies continue to support the traditional belief that active sodium transport is the basic process in proximal tubules, distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts. However, the findings in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop or, as we prefer to call it, the “diluting segment” 1 are in striking disagreement with the traditional concept. In this segment it is now apparent that active chloride transport, rather than sodium transport, is the primary event, and that the major effect of several important diuretics is to inhibit the active chloride transport, rather than sodium transport, as previously believed. In what follows, I will first review the evidence that there is active chloride transport in the diluting segment, then discuss the effects of some diuretic drugs on this chloride transport...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{orienting}} digital images of chest x-rays, which were captured at some multiple of 90 {{degrees from the}} true orientation, is a typical pattern classification problem. In this case, {{the solution to the}} problem must assign an instance of a digital image to one of four classes, where each class corresponds to one of the four possible orientations. A large number of techniques are available for developing a pattern classifier. Some of these techniques are characterized by independent variables whose values are difficult <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> <b>back</b> to the problem being solved. If a technique is highly sensitive to the values of these variables, the lack of a rigorous way of defining them can be a significant disadvantage to the inexperienced researcher. This thesis presents experiments by the author to solve the chest x-ray orientation problem using four different pattern classification techniques: genetic programming, an artificial neural network trained with back propagation, a probabilistic neural network, and a simple linear classifier. In addition, the author will demonstrate that an understanding of the design of a feature set may allow a programmer to develop a traditional program which does an adequate job of solving the classification problem. Comparisons of the different techniques will be based not only on their success at solving the problem, but also on the time required to find an acceptable solution {{and the degree to which}} each technique is sensitive to the values of the variables which characterize it. The thesis demonstrates that all of the techniques can be used to derive very accurate chest x-ray orientation classifiers. While it is dangerous to generalize the results of these experiments to pattern classification problems in general, the author will argue that the magnitude of the differences in performance between the different techniques minimizes this danger. In particular, the experiments suggest that the linear classifier is so computationally inexpensive that it is always worth trying, unless there is a priori knowledge that it will fail. The experiments also suggest that genetic programming is much more computationally expensive than are the linear classifier, artificial neural network, and probabilistic neural network techniques. Of the four conventional pattern classification techniques which were examined, it will be shown that the artificial neural network produced the most accurate classifiers for the x-ray orientation problem. In addition, the results of a number of trials suggest that the final accuracy of the classifier is relatively insensitive to the values of the parameters which characterize this technique, making it an appropriate choice for the inexperienced researcher. With respect to the ability of the resulting classifier to accurately orient sample x-rays which were not included in the training set, the artificial neural network performed well, when compared to the other techniques. Although the classifiers produced by the genetic programming technique were significantly more expensive to construct and were slightly less accurate than the best artificial neural networks, the results of genetic programming experiments can provide insights into the problem being studied, which would be difficult to discern from the classifiers produced by the other techniques. For example, one of the classifiers which was produced by genetic programming uses only eight of the twenty feature values extracted from the sample x-ray. Not only does this reduce the cost of extracting the feature values from an unknown sample, but the classifier itself would be much more efficient to evaluate than the classifiers produced by any of the other techniques...|$|E
