40|$|The {{capacity}} of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems {{has been studied}} in two different contexts in [3, 4]. In [3] and [4], signature sequence sets that maximize the information theoretic capacity and user capacity, respectively, of CDMA systems were identified. In both cases, it was shown that {{if the number of}} users is less <b>than</b> the <b>processing</b> gain then orthogonal signature sequences are optimal and if the number of users is larger <b>than</b> the <b>processing</b> gain then Welch bound equality (WBE) sequences are optimal. This paper presents an algorithm which uses receiver measurements to iteratively update the signature sequences in a distributed fashion, starting from an initial set of signature sequences. We prove that the algorithm converges to a set of orthogonal signature sequences when the number of users is less <b>than</b> the <b>processing</b> gain. We observe and conjecture that the algorithm converges to a WBE set when the number of users is greater <b>than</b> the <b>processing</b> gain. We prove the co [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Unintentional {{plagiarism}} {{is greater}} for information generated by others than ourselves. Researchers believe this may due to having better memory and associations for words we generate, as self-generated information is better remembered later. Moreover, cryptomnesia increases when information {{is generated by}} others before a self-generated idea. This {{may be due to}} the likelihood that people were thinking of their next response, rather <b>than</b> <b>processing</b> the source of the information.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} science, I/O bound {{refers to}} a condition in which {{the time it takes to}} complete a computation is determined principally by the period spent waiting for input/output operations to be completed. This is the opposite of a task being CPU bound. This circumstance arises when the rate at which data is requested is slower than the rate it is consumed or, in other words, more time is spent requesting data <b>than</b> <b>processing</b> it.|$|E

50|$|When {{punctuation}} {{and similar}} clues are not consistently available, the segmentation task often requires fairly non-trivial techniques, such as statistical decision-making, large dictionaries, {{as well as}} consideration of syntactic and semantic constraints. Effective natural language processing systems and text segmentation tools usually operate on text in specific domains and sources.

Most of such credit card transactions are more of a habit than an actual need for credit {{and to the extent that}} such purchases represent convenience or lack of planning to carry cash on the part of consumers, these transactions add a layer of unnecessary expense. However, debit or check card transactions are cheaper <b>than</b> <b>processing</b> paper checks.|$|E
50|$|Information {{processing}} for ambivalent attitudes is {{less efficient}} and takes longer <b>than</b> <b>processing</b> of attitudes that are relatively univalent. The information is less accessible, {{so it takes}} longer {{for a person to}} integrate multiple viewpoints regarding an attitude object into one cohesive opinion or judgement. The lack of accessibility here does serve to reduce a biased thought process. Yet, since it takes a greater amount of effort to resolve two conflicting attitudes, if one desires to form a conclusion, a more extensive thought process is necessary.|$|E

Rather <b>than</b> <b>processing</b> oil from the Rincon field, it receives and processes oil from the offshore Dos Cuadras and Carpinteria fields, feeding it into the M-143 pipeline which crosses through the Rincon field {{on the way to}} Ventura. A single massive 268,000 barrel tank, the feature of the plant visible at the greatest distance, stores oil from the Rincon field prior to shipping it through the pipeline.|$|E
50|$|Digital {{humanities}} descends {{from the}} field of humanities computing, whose origins reach back to the late 1940s in the pioneering work of Jesuit scholar Roberto Busa and the women he employed. In collaboration with IBM, he created a computer-generated concordance to Thomas Aquinas’ writings known as the Index Thomisticus. Other scholars began using mainframe computers to automate tasks like word-searching, sorting, and counting, which was much faster <b>than</b> <b>processing</b> information from texts with handwritten or typed index cards. In the decades which followed archaeologists, classicists, historians, literary scholars, and a broad array of humanities researchers in other disciplines applied emerging computational methods to transform humanities scholarship.|$|E
50|$|Instruction {{pipelining}} is {{a technique}} that implements a form of parallelism called instruction-level parallelism within a single processor. It therefore allows faster CPU throughput (the number of instructions that can be executed in a unit of time) than would otherwise be possible at a given clock rate. The basic instruction cycle is broken up into a series called a pipeline. Rather <b>than</b> <b>processing</b> each instruction sequentially (finishing one instruction before starting the next), each instruction is split up into a sequence of dependent steps so different steps can be executed in parallel and instructions can be processed concurrently (starting one instruction before finishing the previous one).|$|E

40|$|The {{functional}} {{anatomy of}} Chinese character processing was investigated using fMRI. Right-handed Mandarin-English bilingual participants made either semantic or perceptual size judgements with characters and pictures. Areas jointly activated by character and picture semantic tasks compared to size judgement tasks included the left prefrontal region (BA 9, 44, 45), left posterior temporal, left fusiform, and left parietal regions. Character processing produced greater activation <b>than</b> picture <b>processing</b> {{in the left}} mid and posterior temporal as well as left prefrontal regions. The lateral occipital regions were more active during picture semantic <b>processing</b> <b>than</b> character semantic <b>processing.</b> A similar pattern of activation and contrasts was observed when English words and pictures were compared in another set of bilingual participants. However, there was less contrast between word and picture semantic <b>processing</b> <b>than</b> between character and picture processing in the left prefrontal region. When character and word semantic processing were compared directly in a third group, the loci of activation peaks was similar in both languages but Chinese character semantic processing {{was associated with a}} larger MR signal change. The semantic processing of Chinese characters, English words, and pictures activates a common semantic system within which there are modality-specific differences. The semantic processing of Chinese characters more closely resembles English words than pictures. (C) 2000 Academic Press. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
