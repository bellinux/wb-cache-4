5|$|Red maple is a {{good choice}} of a tree for urban areas when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> room for its root system. Forming an {{association}} with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi can help A. rubrum grow along city streets. It is more tolerant of pollution and road salt than Sugar Maples, although the tree's fall foliage is not as vibrant in this environment. Like several other maples, its low root system can be invasive and it makes a poor choice for plantings near paving. It attracts squirrels, who eat its buds in the early spring, although squirrels prefer the larger buds of the silver maple.|$|E
5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{iconographic}} forms of Shiva. It is found in more or less all temples and shrines dedicated to Shiva all over India and South-east Asia. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> evidence from texts and the multiple depictions of the Ardhanarishvara in stone to suggest that a cult centred around the deity may have existed. The cult may have had occasional followers, but was never aligned to any sect. This cult focusing on the joint worship of Shiva and the Goddess may even have had a high position in Hinduism, but when and how it faded away remains a mystery. Though a popular iconographic form, temples dedicated to the deity are few. A popular one is located in Thiruchengode, while five others are located in Kallakkurichi taluk, all of them in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.|$|E
5|$|In January {{they find}} a {{restaurant}} that specializes in local cuisine and, previously vegetarians, they cook and eat beef {{for the first time}} in years. Working in Malawi, MacKinnon is struck by the contrast between their western diet and that of the poor country's: <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> food supplies in Malawi but most is exported to Canada and the United States who buy the food they do not require. The couple learn about Mexican and Maya cuisine while in Merida, Mexico for a wedding. The book ends with an epilogue, written by both Smith and MacKinnon six months after their one-year diet. They make a symbolic journey to Bamfield, within their 100-mile radius, to collect sea water for its salt and prove they could obtain their own salt supply.|$|E

5|$|Einstein's {{theory has}} {{important}} astrophysical implications. For example, it implies {{the existence of}} black holes—regions of space in which space and time are distorted {{in such a way}} that nothing, not even light, can escape—as an end-state for massive stars. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> evidence that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes; for example, microquasars and active galactic nuclei result from the presence of stellar black holes and supermassive black holes, respectively. The bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky. General relativity also predicts the existence of gravitational waves, which have since been observed directly by physics collaboration LIGO. In addition, general relativity is the basis of current cosmological models of a consistently expanding universe.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{policies}} and practices which resulted in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to RTL have not fundamentally changed: quite the contrary. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> evidence that such policies and practices are continuing in full force. The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP’s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal prosecution and being sent to “brainwashing centres” {{and other forms of}} arbitrary detention. Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “black jails” and other forms of arbitrary detention. Human rights defenders, democracy advocates, whistle-blowers and other political activists are also being increasingly targeted through criminal detention, “black jails”, short-term administrative detention, and enforced disappearances, rather than RTL.|$|E

25|$|Grid reference: Although {{professional}} map-making {{and use of}} {{the grid}} had existed in China before, the Chinese cartographer and geographer Pei Xiu of the Three Kingdoms period was the first to mention a plotted geometrical grid reference and graduated scale displayed on the surface of maps to gain greater accuracy in the estimated distance between different locations. Historian Howard Nelson asserts that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the idea of the grid reference from the map of Zhang Heng (78139 CE), a polymath inventor and statesman of the Eastern Han dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Author Martin Bollinger {{reports that}} during the ship's Soviet career <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> {{evidence}} that Dzhurma was used on Gulag routes between 1936 and 1950.

Travel time to Magadan was about 6 to 14 days; trips to the Arctic were seasonal as during the winter the sea froze over. A steamer would make about ten trips a year. Conditions were horrendous, and many people did not survive the trip.|$|E
25|$|The great Library of Alexandria {{was later}} burned. There {{is a growing}} {{consensus}} among historians that the Library of Alexandria likely suffered from several destructive events, but that the destruction of Alexandria's pagan temples in the late 4th century {{was probably the most}} severe and final one. The evidence for that destruction is the most definitive and secure. Caesar's invasion may well have led to the loss of some 40,000-70,000 scrolls in a warehouse adjacent to the port (as Luciano Canfora argues, they were likely copies produced by the Library intended for export), but it is unlikely to have affected the Library or Museum, given that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> evidence that both existed later.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of the Uruk period (c. 4100–2900 BC calibrated), the volume of trade goods transported along the canals and rivers of {{southern}} Mesopotamia facilitated the rise of many large, stratified, temple-centered cities (with populations of over 10,000 people) where centralized administrations employed specialized workers. It is fairly certain that it was during the Uruk period that Sumerian cities began to make use of slave labor captured from the hill country, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> evidence for captured slaves as workers in the earliest texts. Artifacts, and even colonies of this Uruk civilization have been found over a wide area—from the Taurus Mountains in Turkey, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, and as far east as central Iran.|$|E
25|$|A main {{consideration}} regarding timber piles is {{that they}} should be protected from rotting above groundwater level. Timber will last for a long time below the groundwater level. For timber to rot, two elements are needed: water and oxygen. Below the groundwater level, dissolved oxygen is lacking even though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> water. Hence, timber tends to last for a long time below groundwater level. In 1648 the Royal Palace of Amsterdam was constructed on 13659 timber piles that still survive today since they were below groundwater level. Timber that is to be used above the water table can be protected from decay and insects by numerous forms of wood preservation using pressure treatment (alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ), chromated copper arsenate (CCA), creosote, etc.).|$|E
25|$|In the Tiberian masoretic codices, {{the unique}} system of cantillation for Sifrei Emet is complemented by a scribal layout {{unlike that of}} the rest of the Bible: Instead of the three narrow columns per page typical of these codices, Sifrei Emet are written in two wide columns per page. In each line of these wide columns text begins on the right, {{followed}} by a gap, and then continued by further text until the left margin of the column. Although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> evidence that the scribes attempted to place the gaps in the middle of the lines at the points where the cantillation divides the verses, they often did not succeed in doing so because of space limitations. Modern editions based upon the Aleppo Codex have implemented the idea fully by allowing wide full-page columns for Psalms, Proverbs, and Job.|$|E
