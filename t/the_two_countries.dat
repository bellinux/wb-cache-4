5|$|The {{majority}} international {{reaction was}} extremely critical of Lumumba. Lumumba's attack on colonialism was especially {{interpreted as an}} attack on Belgium itself and nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>countries.</b> International observers though the speech unwise, ungrateful and tactless. The confrontational attitude taken by Lumumba appeared to confirm Belgian and American suspicions that Lumumba was a dangerous radical. Between September 1960 and January 1961, partly at the instigation of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>countries,</b> Lumumba was deposed from power, arrested and executed with the complicity of both the Congolese and Katangese governments.|$|E

5|$|During the Great Turkish War (1683–1698), Slavonia was regained but western Bosnia, {{which had}} been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest, {{remained}} outside Croatian control.

5|$|After an {{incident}} involving sentries on the Greek-Bulgarian border in October 1925, fighting began between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>countries.</b> Three {{days after the}} initial incident, Greek troops invaded Bulgaria.

40|$|This paper {{measures}} environmental {{productivity in}} 70 countries {{over the period}} 1981 – 2007. Differences in green (environmental) productivity growth across countries under distinct country specific production frontier are measured using directional distance function model, which incorporates desirable output (GDP) and undesirable output (CO 2 emissions). The metafrontier which envelops <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>country</b> groups, developed countries and developing countries, are estimated using balanced panel data for the sample countries over the study period. A parametric method is used to compute technical efficiency change, technical change, and scale efficiency change, which aggregate to the generalized metafrontier Malmquist productivity index. The overall results indicated <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>country</b> groups operated under distinct stochastic production frontiers and therefore used different production technologies. It is found that developing countries achieved higher growth in their average environmental productivity relative to the metafrontier. Thus the results coincide with the convergence growth theory...|$|R
