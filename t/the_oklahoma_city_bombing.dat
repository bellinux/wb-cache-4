5|$|In 2016, it was {{reported}} that early on in his imprisonment Kaczynski had befriended Ramzi Yousef and Timothy McVeigh, the perpetrators of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and <b>the</b> <b>Oklahoma</b> <b>City</b> <b>bombing,</b> respectively. The trio discussed religion and politics and formed a friendship which lasted until McVeigh's execution in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, 2001, with {{consideration}} of other events including <b>the</b> <b>Oklahoma</b> <b>City</b> <b>Bombing,</b> the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter the disaster area more quickly. By helping civilians out, and rescue workers in, the number of casualties will hopefully be decreased.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Oklahoma</b> <b>City</b> <b>bombing</b> was a {{domestic}} terrorist truck bombing on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States on April 19, 1995. Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the bombing killed 168 people, injured more than 680 others, and destroyed {{one-third of the}} building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated $652million worth of damage. Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies {{in the wake of}} the bombing, and substantial donations were received from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated eleven of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations. <b>The</b> <b>Oklahoma</b> <b>City</b> <b>bombing</b> was the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil until the September 11 attacks six years later, and it still remains the deadliest incident of domestic terrorism in United States history.|$|E
50|$|The police {{stated that}} one of the arrested men ordered three metric tonnes (6,600 pounds) of {{ammonium}} nitrate fertilizer, a potentially powerful ingredient often used as quarry and mining explosives. This weight has widely been compared to the amount of ammonium nitrate used in <b>the</b> 1995 <b>Oklahoma</b> <b>City</b> <b>bombing</b> in <b>the</b> United States. The official account estimates the ammonium nitrate in <b>the</b> <b>Oklahoma</b> <b>City</b> <b>bomb</b> at 2,000 pounds, or about 0.9 metric tonnes. There was not any imminent danger to the public, as a harmless substance was substituted for the ordered ammonium nitrate and delivered to the men by INSET officers in a sting operation.|$|R

5|$|In 1995, Oklahoma City was {{the site}} {{of one of the most}} {{destructive}} acts of domestic terrorism in American history. <b>The</b> <b>Oklahoma</b> <b>City</b> <b>bombing</b> of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P.

His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.|$|E
5|$|Jim Caviezel's character, Carroll Oerstadt, {{seemed to}} mirror {{in several ways}} the story of Timothy McVeigh, a {{domestic}} terrorist who destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City with a bomb in 1995. Caviezel and Scott did not deny this, and both admitted that the Oerstadt character was at least partly based on McVeigh. Ross Johnson of The New York Times also compared the ferry bombing at the film's beginning to <b>the</b> <b>Oklahoma</b> <b>City</b> <b>bombing.</b>|$|E

25|$|In February 2004, the FBI {{announced}} it would review its investigation after learning that agents {{in the investigation of}} the Midwest Bank Robbers (an alleged Aryan-oriented gang) had turned up explosive caps of the same type that were used to trigger <b>the</b> <b>Oklahoma</b> <b>City</b> <b>bomb.</b> Agents expressed surprise that bombing investigators had not been provided information from the Midwest Bank Robbers investigation.

25|$|Legal experts {{argued that}} a major {{obstacle}} to granting Davis a new trial was the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, passed after <b>the</b> <b>Oklahoma</b> <b>City</b> <b>bombing,</b> which bars death row inmates from later presenting evidence they could have presented at trial.

25|$|On May 20, 1995, {{primarily}} {{as a response to}} <b>the</b> <b>Oklahoma</b> <b>City</b> <b>bombing</b> of April 19, 1995, the United States Secret Service closed off Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the White House from the eastern edge of Lafayette Park to 17th Street.

With 189 Americans killed, the bombing was the deadliest {{act of terrorism}} against the US prior to <b>the</b> <b>Oklahoma</b> <b>City</b> <b>bombing</b> and the September 11 attacks. Many of the passengers came from the states of New Jersey and New York.|$|E
25|$|The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was a United States federal {{government}} complex located at 200 N.W. 5th Street in Downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States.

50|$|<b>The</b> 1995 <b>Oklahoma</b> <b>City</b> <b>bombing</b> {{occurred}} a {{few months}} after this law came into effect, and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 was passed in response, which further increased the federal death penalty.
