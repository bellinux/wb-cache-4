5|$|While Richard was at Mile End, the Tower {{was taken}} by the rebels. A force of rebels, {{separate}} from those operating under Tyler at Mile End, approached the castle, possibly in the late morning. The gates were open to receive Richard on his return and a crowd of around 400 rebels entered the fortress, encountering no resistance, possibly because the guards were <b>terrified</b> <b>by</b> them.|$|E

In Matthew and Mark, <b>terrified</b> <b>by</b> the events, a Roman centurion states that Jesus was the Son of God.|$|E
5|$|The large, maze-like mansion's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} with angles slightly askew, resulting in off-center perspectives and doors that {{open and close}} by themselves.

During their first night in the house, Eleanor and Theo are <b>terrified</b> <b>by</b> supernatural occurrences outside Theo's bedroom door.

25|$|Makeup artists Tom Burman and Bari Dreiband-Burman {{and actor}} Jeffrey Jones {{discussed}} {{the appearance of}} the Dark Overlord character with Huyck and Katz, and developed the character's progressing looks. When Katz's daughter visited the set during the shoot, she was <b>terrified</b> <b>by</b> Jones' appearance in makeup. The diner sequence combines practical effects, including squibs and air cannons, with visual effects created by ILM. Sound designer Ben Burtt created the voice of the Dark Overlord by altering Jeffrey Jones' voice as his character transformed. Stop motion effects during the climax were designed by Phil Tippett, who began with a clay model before upgrading to more sophisticated pieces.|$|E
25|$|From 22 July 1940 de Gaulle used 4 Carlton Gardens {{in central}} London as his London headquarters. His family had left Brittany (the other ship which {{left at the}} same time was sunk) and lived for a time at Petts Wood. As his {{daughter}} Anne was <b>terrified</b> <b>by</b> The Blitz they moved to Ellesmere in Shropshire, a four-hour journey from London and where de Gaulle was only able to visit them once a month. His wife and daughter also lived for a time in the country at Rodinghead House, Little Gaddesden, in Hertfordshire, 45 kilometres (28 miles) from Central London. De Gaulle lived at the Connaught Hotel in London, then from 1942–44 he lived in Hampstead, North London.|$|E
25|$|An acolyte {{unable to}} effect this change dies. Only women have ever survived the agony, but through their {{breeding}} program the Bene Gesserit seek the male Kwisatz Haderach {{who will be}} able to change an illuminating poison. The Bene Gesserit try over many generations through selective breeding to produce such a being. A Kwisatz Haderach is given abilities different from those of a Reverend Mother. During the spice agony, there are two areas of the soul that the acolyte may visit — the part that gives, and the part that takes; a Reverend Mother cannot access the memories of her male ancestors, and is <b>terrified</b> <b>by</b> the psychic space within her that the masculine memories inhabit. Until Paul Atreides, all men who had attempted the spice agony had died.|$|E

25|$|In January 2000, a tip-off to Scotland Yard detectives {{exposed a}} plot to kidnap Victoria and Brooklyn Beckham and hold them at a house in Hampstead, London. The family was then moved to a secret location, but no arrests were made. Later in March 2000, she {{received}} a death threat prior to performing at the Brit Awards with the Spice Girls, and in the show's rehearsal, a red laser light appeared on her chest and she was rushed off stage. After a fire door {{was found to be}} lodged open, it was thought that there had been an assassin there, and Beckham later revealed that she was <b>terrified</b> <b>by</b> the experience. In November 2002, five people were arrested after another plot for her kidnap was infiltrated by a tabloid newspaper. All charges were dropped after a witness was deemed unreliable.|$|E
25|$|Polly and Digory {{grab her}} and put on their rings to take her out of their world, {{dragging}} with them Uncle Andrew, Frank the cab-driver, and Frank's horse, since all were touching one another when the children grabbed their rings. In the Wood between the Worlds they jump into a pool, hoping it leads back to Charn. Instead they stumble into a dark void that Jadis recognises as a world not yet created. They then all witness {{the creation of a}} new world by the lion Aslan, who brings stars, plants, and animals into existence as he sings. Jadis, as <b>terrified</b> <b>by</b> his singing as the others are attracted to it, tries to kill Aslan with the iron rod; but it rebounds harmlessly off him, and in the creative soil of the new world it sprouts into a growing lamp-post. Jadis flees.|$|E
25|$|William A. Prestre, a Swiss citizen {{living in}} Santa Fe, New Mexico, {{proposed}} using large dogs to kill Japanese soldiers. He convinced {{the military to}} lease an entire island in the Mississippi River to house the training facilities. There the army hoped to train {{as many as two}} million dogs. The idea was to begin island invasions with landing craft releasing thousands of dogs against the Japanese defenders, then followed up by troops as the Japanese defenders scattered in confusion. One of the biggest problems encountered was getting Japanese soldiers to train the dogs, as very few Japanese soldiers were being captured. Eventually, Japanese-American soldiers volunteered for the training. The biggest problem was the dogs, as they were either too docile, did not respond to training teaching them to rush across beaches, or were <b>terrified</b> <b>by</b> shellfire. After millions of dollars were spent, the program was abandoned.|$|E
