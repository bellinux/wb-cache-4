5|$|At first clients sent hole-punched {{accounting}} records to a Reynolds processing center, which would print a complete accounting that is sent back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> by mail. The development of modems and internet {{technology in the}} 1970s led to several advancements. Reynolds provided 3,600 specialized modems to dealerships between 1974 and 1978. The modems communicated with Reynolds' VIM-brand minicomputers at 80 Reynolds locations, which provided computing power and printed forms. This eliminated the need for clients to ship data to Reynolds in tapes and allowed daily access to online services. By {{the end of the}} 1970s, batch processing and computer processing centers were being phased out in response to personal computers kept at the dealership. In the years 1978 and 1982, Reynolds introduced VIM-brand computer systems that were kept at dealerships.|$|E
5|$|Architectural {{management}} can {{be defined}} as an ordered way of thinking which helps to realise a quality building for an acceptable cost or as a process function with the aim of delivering greater architectural value <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> and society. Research by Kiran Gandhi describes architectural management as a set of practical techniques for an architect to successfully operate his practice. The term architectural management has been in use since the 1960s. The evolution of the field of architectural management has not been a smooth affair. Architectural practice was merely considered a business until after the Second World War, and even then practitioners appeared {{to be concerned about the}} conflict between art and commerce, demonstrating indifference to management. There was apparent conflict between the image of an architect and the need for professional management of the architectural business. Reluctance to embrace management and business as an inherent part of architectural practice could also be seen in architectural education programmes and publications. It appears that the management of architectural design, as well as architectural management in general, is still not being given enough importance. Architectural management falls into two distinct parts: office or practice management and project management. Office management provides an overall framework within which many individual projects are commenced, managed, and completed. Architectural management extends between the management of the design process, construction, and project management, through to facilities management of buildings in use. It is a powerful tool that can be applied to the benefit of professional service firms and the total building processes, yet it continues to receive too little attention both in theory and in practice.|$|E

40|$|Service-level {{agreements}} (SLAs) {{establish a}} contract between service providers and clients concerning Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. Without proper penalties, service providers have strong incentives <b>to</b> deviate from <b>the</b> advertised QoS, causing losses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>clients.</b> Reliable QoS monitoring (and proper penalties computed {{on the basis}} of delivered QoS) are therefore essential for the trustworthiness of a service-oriented environment. In this paper, we present a novel QoS monitoring mechanism based on quality ratings from <b>the</b> <b>clients.</b> A reputation mechanism collects the ratings and computes the actual quality delivered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>clients.</b> <b>The</b> mechanism provides incentives for <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> <b>to</b> report honestly, and pays special attention to minimizing cost and overhead. ...|$|R

RDS is Microsoft's implementation of thin client, where Windows software, and the entire desktop of the computer running RDS, are made accessible to a remote client machine that supports Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). With RDS, only software user interfaces are transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> system. All input from the client system is transmitted to the server, where software execution takes place. This is in contrast to application streaming systems, like Microsoft App-V, in which computer programs are streamed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> on-demand and executed on the client machine.|$|E

25|$|Paul Ricoeur discussed, in {{a similar}} vein to Martin and Sugarman and Mensch, the concept of intropathy through which he {{described}} imagination as a representation “of things absent but still existing somewhere else” (p.171). These representations of things absent exist in the mind, or imagination, of “an external observer,” or for therapeutic purposes, the therapist, and have the function of “taking the place of.” A therapist's own approximate memories can assist in understanding the client's experiences and enable the therapist to relate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> empathically.|$|E

25|$|Ontological hermeneutics {{provides}} {{a way for the}} clients and therapist to work together to create subjective truth and meaning for the client. Where other therapies such as Cognitive-behavioral therapy, Rational-emotive behavioral therapy, Dialectical-behavioral therapy, and other eclectic approaches frequently create a conflict between freedom and commitment for the client. For example, a client seeing a counselor may want to work on becoming more of an individual by exploring his or her self-concept by finding personal meaning, breaking away from social trends and peer pressure, and discovering his or her own interests. Therapists utilizing traditional theories, like cognitive behavioral therapy, rational emotive behavioral therapy, or even eclectic approaches, will guide the client in this process according to how the therapist's chosen therapy would say about how an individual ought to go about this process. In other words, the client will have to commit to exploring his or her self-concept based on how cognitive behavioral therapy, or another therapy, says the client should learn about who they are, therefore limiting the amount of freedom afforded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> to creatively develop his or her own ways of self-exploration. Proponents of ontological hermeneutics state that hermeneutic psychotherapy strives to provide freedom <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> by affording his or her voice a privileged position in therapy to develop their own options.|$|E
