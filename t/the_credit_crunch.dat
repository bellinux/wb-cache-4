5|$|In 2007, KKR {{filed with}} the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise $1.25 billion by selling an {{ownership}} interest in its management company. The filing came {{less than two weeks}} after the initial public offering of rival private equity firm Blackstone Group. KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>crunch</b> and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened the prospects of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, in July 2008, KKR {{announced a}} new plan to list its shares. The plan called for KKR to complete a reverse takeover of its listed affiliate KKR Private Equity Investors {{in exchange for a}} 21% interest in the firm. In November 2008, KKR announced a delay of this transaction until 2009. Shares of KPE had declined significantly {{in the second half of}} 2008 with the onset of <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>crunch.</b> KKR has announced that it expects to close the transaction in 2009. In October 2009, KKR listed shares in KKR & Co. on the Euronext exchange, replacing KPE and anticipates a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. The public entity represents a 30% interest in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. In October 2010, KKR acquired about nine members of Goldman Sachs Group proprietary trading team after entertaining offers from investment firms such as Perella Weinberg and Blackrock. With Goldman shutting down its proprietary trading operations, its executives, led by Bob Howard, will help KKR expand beyond leveraged buyouts into areas such as hedge funds.|$|E

Performance fees have been criticized by Warren Buffett, who believes that because hedge funds share only the profits and not the losses, such fees create an incentive for high-risk investment management.

25|$|The Friends Life t20 (previously {{known as}} the Friends Provident t20) was a Twenty20 cricket league in England and Wales run by the ECB from 2010 to 2013.

This plan, announced by the ECB in February 2009, replaced a more ambitious English cricket league project which would have included two overseas teams. The proposal was substantially modified following <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>crunch,</b> and the change in circumstances of Allen Stanford himself. Friends Provident were announced as sponsors of the competition, having previously sponsored the 50-over competition.|$|E

25|$|In January 2007, Surrey CCC, {{announced}} plans to increase capacity by a further 2,000 seats, this time by redeveloping the Pavilion End. The Lock, Laker, and Peter May south stands were {{to be replaced by}} a new stand, which would have a hotel backing on to it. The Surrey Tavern at the entrance to the ground would be demolished, and a new pedestrian plaza would be created in its place, improving access to the ground and opening up views of the historic pavilion. These plans were delayed by objections raised by the Health & Safety Executive as the ground is close to a gasometer.

25|$|For {{repayment}} of the Government loans, {{there was}} a proposal to create an 'asset pool' at the bank, of a size greater than the loans. The bidder would have issued bonds against this asset pool, with maturities set inline with the repayment. Proceeds from the bond issue would have also gone to the Government and the bank would have paid for a government guarantee for the bonds to trade in the market at or near prices of similar gilt-edged stocks. This would have replaced the original plan for the bidders {{to have to find}} their own investors to cover the first £15bn, which proved impossible, due to <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>crunch.</b> The government would also continue to guarantee the Bank's liabilities, such as savers' deposits.|$|E
25|$|One of the town's most {{well-known}} shops, the shoe store Tommy Ball's, closed in May 2008 after going into administration.

However, in January 2009 {{the directors of the}} company announced that the shop would close following a 30-day statutory consultation, unless they change their mind or a buyer is found. The markets continue to offer a wide range of local produce—Lancashire cheeses, tripe, Bowland beef and lamb can all be found. Walsh's Sarsaparilla stall decided not to move into the new market development. The market moved into the Mall shopping centre in 2011, and now opens 6 days a week (closed on bank holidays).|$|E

500|$|Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>crunch</b> has {{prompted}} buyout firms {{to pursue a}} new group of transactions in order to deploy their massive investment funds. [...] These transactions have included Private Investment in Public Equity (or PIPE) transactions as well as purchases of debt in existing leveraged buyout transactions. [...] Some of the most notable of these transactions completed in the depths of <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>crunch</b> include Apollo Management's acquisition of the Citigroup Loan Portfolio (2008) and TPG Capital's PIPE investment in Washington Mutual (2008). [...] According to investors and fund managers, the consensus among industry members in late 2009 was that private equity firms will need to become more like asset managers, offering buyouts as just part of their portfolio, or else focus tightly on specific sectors in order to prosper. [...] The industry must also become better in adding value by turning businesses around rather than pure financial engineering.|$|E
