5|$|On 1 April 2003, Kato Air {{took over}} the Bodø–Røst route, using Dornier Do 228 aircraft. The new airline had a troubled start with the {{passenger}} numbers dropping by 27 percent. On 4 December, a flight from Røst to Bodø was hit by lightning, and received severe damage during the landing at Bodø. The choice of the operator was criticized by the Røst Municipal Council following the incident, stated that the ministry had prioritized price over safety. The council stated {{that they did not}} feel that Kato Air provided the same service as Widerøe and that the aircraft were a safety hazard. Among the complaints were lack of accessibility for disabled people, no cabin pressurization, no weather radar, more expensive tickets, no discounted tickets and no possibility for carry-on baggage. In February 2006, there was a wave of cancellations by Kato Air, due to technical problems with both the airline's aircraft. In June, the airline's pilots started selling tickets themselves at the airport. The company stated that this was because they had declined Widerøe <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> of higher costs. The Civil Aviation Authority of Norway withdrew Kato Air's concession in 2008 due to lack on maintenance. On an interim basis, the helicopter airline Lufttransport, that operated the route to the nearby island of Værøy, {{took over the}} route from 5 September to 29 October, when Widerøe started flying again.|$|E

However, not all artisans have been able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> <b>Because</b> of the difficulty in making a living, many artisans emigrate to the United States.|$|E
25|$|As preterm {{birth is}} such a risk for women with {{multiple}} pregnancies, {{it has been suggested}} that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known.|$|E

25|$|RNAP accomplishes de novo synthesis. It is able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> {{specific}} {{interactions with}} the initiating nucleotide hold RNAP rigidly in place, facilitating chemical attack on the incoming nucleotide. Such specific interactions explain why RNAP prefers to start transcripts with ATP (followed by GTP, UTP, and then CTP). In contrast to DNA polymerase, RNAP includes helicase activity, therefore no separate enzyme is needed to unwind DNA.|$|E
25|$|Both {{these lines}} were {{incorporated}} in a Bill before Parliament in 1920, the Beeston and Chilwell line being passed, and the Hucknall line being passed {{subject to the}} completion of certain road works. Hucknall Urban District Council, the highway authority, objected to the line terminating in Hucknall Market Place; they were anxious for its extension to Annesley, but the Corporation was unwilling <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> of the sparseness of the population between the two districts.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, CBS {{provided}} {{prime time}} coverage for Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals, marking the network's first pre-Finals prime time playoff telecast since 1975. CBS was able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> the NBA decided {{to push the}} Finals back from late May until early June. With the Finals starting a week later, the awkward long pauses between Games 1 and 2 were no longer required. Because of this, instead of Game 2 of the Finals being shown {{on the first night}} after sweeps ended, CBS could show Game 6 of the Conference Finals.|$|E
25|$|In certain circumstances, {{it is not}} {{possible}} for the holder of the visa <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> either <b>because</b> the country does not have a mechanism to prolong visas or, most likely, because the holder of the visa is using a short stay visa to live in a country.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{sometimes}} convenient {{to think about}} curvature as an operator [...] on tangent bivectors (elements of [...] ), which is uniquely defined by the following identity:It is possible <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> precisely <b>because</b> of the symmetries of the curvature tensor (namely antisymmetry {{in the first and}} last pairs of indices, and block-symmetry of those pairs).|$|R
50|$|The quebradita {{was very}} popular in the 1990s, {{especially}} in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. George Lipsitz, author of Footsteps in the Dark: The Hidden Histories of Popular Music, wrote that in that era many dancers were unwilling or unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> dance <b>because</b> of the required strength, timing, coordination, and cooperation, and therefore the possible dangers from this dance.|$|R
25|$|During the 1870s, an {{economic}} depression caused residents of New York City {{to look for}} better housing opportunities {{in the suburbs of}} Manhattan and Brooklyn, where housing would be cheaper. Two partners, Benjamin W. Hitchcock and Charles C. Denton, first began carving farmland into building lots. They were able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> of their wealth and substantial capital. Housing was first developed in the area after the Long Island Rail Road began service through the area in 1880 as part of its route from Long Island City to Howard Beach. Ozone Park was created and settled in 1882.|$|E
25|$|When the {{cardinals}} {{assembled in the}} Sistine Chapel attention focused on Mariano Rampolla del Tindaro, Leo's Cardinal Secretary of State. Rampolla {{was seen as the}} leading papabile (a cardinal thought likely to be elected pope). As expected, Rampolla was close to being elected, but was then vetoed by Jus exclusivae in the name of Franz Joseph, Emperor of Austria by Jan Maurycy Pawel Puzyna de Kosielsko, the Prince-Bishop of Kraków and a subject of Austria-Hungary. Franz Joseph asked the Pole <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> the Austrian Cardinal would not exercise Jus exclusivae. The veto was pronounced to the disgust of the other cardinals. The reason for the veto was never established but could have been due to Rampolla's support of the French Third Republic while he was Secretary of State.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong was {{responsible}} for developing the hydraulic accumulator. Where water pressure was not available on site {{for the use of}} hydraulic cranes, Armstrong often built high water towers to provide a supply of water at pressure. However, when supplying cranes for use at New Holland on the Humber Estuary, he was unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> the foundations consisted of sand. After much careful thought he produced the weighted accumulator, a cast-iron cylinder fitted with a plunger supporting a very heavy weight. The plunger would slowly be raised, drawing in water, until the downward force of the weight was sufficient to force the water below it into pipes at great pressure. The accumulator was a very significant, if unspectacular, invention, which found many applications in the following years.|$|E

I suppose deep down that the dreams and aspirations I had when I was a kid are very close to theirs.|$|R

When Bob is stolen by a necromancer, Bob advises the wizard against Harry's own interests, but is eventually convinced by Harry to betray his new owner and assist Harry instead. Harry later speculates {{that he was able}} <b>to</b> willingly <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> it was Harry who gave him his name.|$|R
50|$|On April 11, 1965, it was {{announced}} {{at a press conference}} by Walter Lavalleja that a stadium was to be built in Lima for the club Alianza Lima. They were able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> project <b>because</b> the president at that time, Manuel Odria donated a piece of land for the construction of this stadium. On May 30, 1969, {{the first phase of the}} project began.|$|R
25|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Marcellinus in his early life; records first mention his name in 454 when he rebelled against Western Emperor Valentinian III {{following}} his murder and assassination of Flavius Aëtius who was his friend. He was in Dalmatia {{at the time and}} it is believed to have held the title of Comes rei militaris according to the fasti. He was powerful enough to seize control of Dalmatia for himself and was presumably able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> he was commander of the troops there. He appears to have remained ruler of Dalmatia down to 468 and to have preserved his independence except for briefly accepting the authority of the Emperors Majorian and Anthemius. Sources claim he ruled justly and well and kept Dalmatia independent of the emperor and of barbarian rulers.|$|E
25|$|The Standard Model {{leaves the}} mass of the Higgs boson as a {{parameter}} to be measured, rather than a value to be calculated. This is seen as theoretically unsatisfactory, particularly as quantum corrections (related to interactions with virtual particles) should apparently cause the Higgs particle to have a mass immensely higher than that observed, {{but at the same time}} the Standard Model requires a mass of the order of 100 to 1000 GeV to ensure unitarity (in this case, to unitarise longitudinal vector boson scattering). Reconciling these points appears to require explaining why there is an almost-perfect cancellation resulting in the visible mass of ~ 125 GeV, and it is not clear how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> <b>Because</b> the weak force is about 1032 times stronger than gravity, and (linked to this) the Higgs boson's mass is so much less than the Planck mass or the grand unification energy, it appears that either there is some underlying connection or reason for these observations which is unknown and not described by the Standard Model, or some unexplained and extremely precise fine-tuning of parameters – however at present neither of these explanations is proven. This is known as a hierarchy problem. More broadly, the hierarchy problem amounts to the worry that a future theory of fundamental particles and interactions should not have excessive fine-tunings or unduly delicate cancellations, and should allow masses of particles such as the Higgs boson to be calculable. The problem is in some ways unique to spin-0 particles (such as the Higgs boson), which can give rise to issues related to quantum corrections that do not affect particles with spin. A number of solutions have been proposed, including supersymmetry, conformal solutions and solutions via extra dimensions such as braneworld models.|$|E

50|$|The solar {{industry}} in New Mexico is facing hurdles. Most utilities {{want to reduce}} incentives like net metering and charge customers more who have solar systems. The reason they want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> is <b>because</b> the utilities maintain that their role in generating plants, transmitting and distributing electricity through distribution lines, and other fixed costs remain unchanged. They argue that solar customers are not financially contributing to those fixed costs.|$|R

Michael, acting as her manager, tries to pass her off as [...] "the fourth Andrews Sister" [...] ("'cause she was black, they kept her in the background"). A quick flash of her panties gives an old man a heart attack, and Carole gets fired. Meanwhile, Angie tries to use his Mafia {{connections}} to put a murder contract out on his son for [...] "disgracing the family" [...] by dating a black woman.

500|$|Gerard Doyle {{provided}} the {{voice for the}} English audio book of Brisingr. In order to help Doyle with this, Paolini recorded the pronunciation of every invented name and word in Brisingr from a list over nine pages long. It was tricky even for Paolini <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> he cannot [...] "roll [...] r's" [...] properly. Doyle said he prepared for narrating Brisingr by going [...] "largely by physical description. If there are specific details about the voices, I latch onto those as best I can. But if a creature’s anatomical features are described, I try to imagine, for example, how the jaw might work...and then try and adapt that and attach it to something that sounds okay to the ear and is still slightly stranger than normal." ...|$|E
500|$|Byrne was {{at first}} {{reluctant}} but later agreed, and delivered the merchandising contract to Jacobs's office on 4 December 1963, leaving blank the percentages. Jacobs asked Byrne what percentage rate he should write down to which Byrne ambiguously replied: [...] "Oh, look, just put in 10%." [...] A typical percentage would have been 75% or 80% for NEMS, and Byrne expected Epstein would begin to negotiate. However, the contract came back initialled (meaning Epstein had read it) and signed by Epstein and Jacobs. Jacobs's advice to Epstein was, [...] "10% is better than nothing". This lapse of shrewdness set the scene for what would later become a legal battleground which deprived the Beatles and Brian Epstein of such {{large sums of money}} they would have easily overshadowed any royalties they would receive in the medium term from the sale of records. Byrne later said: [...] "They couldn't wait to get somebody else <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> they were in a mess themselves." [...] Epstein would later realise that he had made a colossal error of judgment, as Byrne charged 10% commission to the merchandisers for a licence (receiving $10 out of every hundred) and then giving 10% of that to NEMS, which was $1.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} elements of Goa'uld society is their tendency to pose as gods to other, weaker races, mostly humans and Jaffa. Goa'uld are shown <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> of the luxury and power it brings, and to have their followers mine naqahdah. They fool minor races into believing that they are gods by passing off their technology as magic. Examples of this include opening the Stargate, using hand devices, and their metallic masks, which give them an other-worldly appearance. Some Goa'uld, such as Ba'al and Yu, rule more through cunning than through the facade of divinity, although this is unusual.|$|E
2500|$|Bi-directionality: Most tank {{locomotives}} {{are capable}} of running at full speed in either direction (although this depends of the wheel arrangement; for example, a 2-6-0T {{will not be able}} to run as fast in reverse, due to lack of a trailing truck). Most tender locomotives are unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> the heavy tender is not designed to be pushed and may become unstable at higher speeds. [...] Tender locomotives generally require turning facilities, such as a turntable or wye, at each end of the run. A tank locomotive, on the other hand, can simply run around the train (provided there is a siding) and pull it back in the other direction. [...] The crew of a tank engine generally have a better view in the reverse direction than for a tender engine and are protected from the weather.|$|E
