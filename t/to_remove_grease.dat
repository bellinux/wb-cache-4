50|$|It is {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>grease</b> or oil contamination prior to blast cleaning. Solvent cleaning, burn-off, etc., {{are commonly used}} for this purpose. In the blast cleaning process, compressed air (90 to 110 psi/610 to 760 kPa) is used to force dan abrasive onto the surface to be cleaned. Aluminum oxide, steel grit, steel shot, garnet, coal slag, etc., are the frequently used abrasives. Another method of blast cleaning is centrifugal blast cleaning, which is especially used in cleaning the exterior of pipe. In this method, abrasive is thrown to the rotating pipe body, using a specially designed wheel, which is rotated at high speed, while the abrasive is fed from {{the centre of the}} wheel.|$|E

5000|$|Detergents {{are another}} class of surfactants, and will {{physically}} interact with both oil and water, thus stabilizing {{the interface between}} the oil and water droplets in suspension. This principle is exploited in soap, <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>grease</b> {{for the purpose of}} cleaning. Many different emulsifiers are used in pharmacy to prepare emulsions such as creams and lotions. Common examples include emulsifying wax, cetearyl alcohol, polysorbate 20, and ceteareth 20. Sometimes the inner phase itself can act as an emulsifier, and the result is a nanoemulsion, where the inner state disperses into [...] "nano-size" [...] droplets within the outer phase. A well-known example of this phenomenon, the [...] "Ouzo effect", happens when water is poured into a strong alcoholic anise-based beverage, such as ouzo, pastis, absinthe, arak, or raki. The anisolic compounds, which are soluble in ethanol, then form nano-size droplets and emulsify within the water. The resulting color of the drink is opaque and milky white.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Al 2 O 3 -Al 2 Cu 3 {{multiphase}} coatings {{were prepared}} {{on the surface}} of steel by reactive flame spray. The binding strength, microhardness and abrasion quality of the coatings were measured and analyzed. The influence of the agglomerate size on the properties of the coatings was emphatically studied to choose suitable size range for Al-CuO reactive system. The results showed that coatings prepared by using – 150 ∼+ 250 meshes agglomerates exhibited good mechanical properties. Based on the conventional thermal spray method, researchers have successfully put forward reactive spray technology and developed several corresponding methods including reactive arc spray, reactive plasma spray, and thermally explosive spray and so on. By these methods coatings such as Ti-C, Ti-B, Mo-Si system etc. were fabricated [1]. Reactive spray is different from conventional thermal spray in its purposeful use of SHS reactions during the spraying process to form dense coatings with low energy consumption and cheap reactive materials [2]. In this work metallic ceramic multiphase coatings of Al 2 Cu 3 O 2 were fabricated {{on the surface of}} steel by reactive flame spray. Al-CuO agglomerated powders were sprayed using a converted acetylene-oxygen flame spray gun. Effects {{of the size of the}} agglomerates on mechanical properties of the coatings were discussed. Al powders (purity of 99. 8 %) and analytically pure CuO were agglomerated in a solution of phenolic resin and dried at 100 - 120 ºC and then sieved. The agglomerated powders were sprayed on steel targets of 50 × 50 mm 2 and thickness of 6 mm. The top surface had been cleaned and sanded <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>grease</b> and corrosion layer.
