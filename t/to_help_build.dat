5|$|In 1216, when a Scottish army {{invaded the}} Eden valley and Alan of Galloway {{occupied}} Westmorland, Brougham Castle played {{no part in}} the county's defence, probably because it was unfinished.

Brougham Castle was constructed {{in the northern part of}} the old Roman fort, and stone from the ruins was probably used <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>build</b> the castle. When Robert de Vieuxpont died in 1228, his only son John was a minor, so his property was taken into the care of a warden.|$|E
