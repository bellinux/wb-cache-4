5|$|Irene is a Neoclassical tragedy written between 1726 and 1749 by Samuel Johnson. It has the {{distinction}} of being the work Johnson considered his greatest failure. Since his death, the critical consensus has been that he was right <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{the massacres}} perpetrated by the Mark I robots, Judge Stich {{was unable to}} bear {{his share of the}} {{responsibility}} for the disaster and he went insane. He was committed to a psychiatric ward, from where he would persistently escape and search the sewers for the rogue Number Five. It was therefore generally assumed that McGruder had learned her lesson and that the project had been discontinued. It suited McGruder to allow people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> However, she still authorised the development of Mark IIs, this time under the purview of Tek-Judge Quiggley. After another year of work, Quiggley almost had the improved robots ready for a second field test when Number Five re-emerged from the sewer and began a third campaign of murder. This time Number Five had learned to go to ground after each attack, and all efforts to locate it failed. Taking personal charge of the search, McGruder brought forward the new robots' field test and deployed them on the streets, reasoning (wrongly as it transpired) {{that the best way to}} anticipate the next move of a robot was to use other robots to hunt it.|$|E
500|$|Nabi is {{the older}} brother of Parwana and Masooma. Despite being [...] "a {{character}} who slips beneath the notice {{of many of the}} novel's noisier characters", he organizes the event that serves as the primary plot of the story: the adoption of Pari. After being hired as a chauffeur for the Wahdatis, he becomes infatuated with the childless Nila and arranges for Pari to be sold to her in hopes that she will become his lover. After Nila's husband suffers a stroke and Nila leaves for Paris, he realizes that he had been foolish <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> and becomes the primary caregiver for his bedridden employer. He later develops a deep bond with Mr. Wahdati, and they become platonic lifelong partners.|$|E

2500|$|In his [...] "F.R.L." [...] (1899), Peirce {{states that}} the first, and [...] "in one sense, the sole", rule of reason is that, to learn, one needs to desire to learn and desire it without resting {{satisfied}} with that which one is inclined <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> <b>So,</b> the first rule is, to wonder. Peirce proceeds to a critical theme in research practices and the shaping of theories: ...|$|E
2500|$|The way I have taken, {{is not so}} {{streight}} as Metaphrase, nor so loose as Paraphrase: Some {{things too}} I have omitted, and sometimes added of my own. [...] Yet the omissions I hope, are but of Circumstances, and such as wou'd have no grace in English; and the Addition, I also hope, are easily deduc'd from Virgil's Sense. [...] They will seem (at least I have the Vanity <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>so),</b> not struck into him, but growing out of him. (5:529) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{antiquarian}} Joseph Hunter was {{the first}} to publish all known variations of the spelling of the name, which he did in 1845 in his book Illustrations of the Life, Studies, and Writings of Shakespeare. He gives an account of what was known {{at the time of the}} history of the name of Shakespeare, and lists all its variant forms, including the most idiosyncratic instances such as [...] "Shagsper" [...] and [...] "Saxpere". He linked this to a history of the Shakespeare family and its descendants, though he was not able to add much to the material already identified by Edmond Malone. Hunter noted that [...] "there has been endless variety in the form in which this name has been written." [...] He criticised Malone and Steevens, writing that [...] "in an evil hour they agreed, for no apparent reason, to abolish the e in the first syllable." [...] Hunter argued that there were probably two pronunciations of the name, a Warwickshire version and a London version, so that [...] "the poet himself might be called by his honest neighbours at Stratford and Shottery, Mr. Shaxper, while his friends in London honoured him, as we know historically they did, with the more stately name of Shakespeare." [...] Kathman argues that while it is possible that different pronunciations existed, there is no good reason <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> on the basis of spelling variations.|$|E

2500|$|Former {{president}} of Sarah Lawrence College, Michele Tolela Myers, responded to Michael Skube's rebuttal in the 12 July 2007 Letter to the Editor for the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Argument {{may be a}} rank disgrace." [...] On the general topic of U.S. News methodology, she states, [...] "what many of us dispute is the validity of a single score computed by using [...] "data points" [...] to which weights are arbitrarily ascribed (why should retention count for 20% instead of 30%; why is peer assessment 25% instead of 10%; and who decides?). How can a single measure be valid when, in some cases, values are made up {{when they are not}} provided (the case of the missing SATs at Sarah Lawrence — the point of my Washington Post Op-Ed)? However, that's exactly what U.S. News does each year. Professional statisticians have reported that the methodology used by the magazine is seriously flawed and cannot be trusted." [...] She also responds to Skube's discussion of Sarah Lawrence's decision not to consider SAT or ACT scores by stating, [...] "Skube says he knows 'all he needs to know about Sarah Lawrence' because the college does not use SAT scores in its admission process, and therefore he infers we don't take aptitude seriously. Perhaps he doesn't know the research showing that SAT tests do not measure aptitude and at best provide a guess about academic performance {{in the first year of}} college. I do not think Elon University's SAT scores tell all there is to know about Elon. <b>To</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> would be falling into the trap of using one single measure as a proxy for the complex nature of any college. Which is precisely why the rankings are flawed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Njegoš left Cetinje {{in early}} 1833 {{and set out}} on the long journey to Saint Petersburg. He hoped to be granted a meeting with Russian Emperor (czar) Nicholas I and consecrated as Metropolitan of Cetinje by the Holy Synod. Such a move was {{considered}} highly unusual at the time, as a vladika was traditionally consecrated by the Patriarch of Peć either in Patriarchal Monastery of Peć or in Sremski Karlovci, not Saint Petersburg. According to church canon, a vladika could not be any younger than thirty, a prerequisite that the twenty-year-old Njegoš clearly failed to meet. As such, he chose to have his consecration occur in Saint Petersburg out of political necessity, as he desperately needed the czar to bend church canons in his favour in order to acquire total legitimacy at home and brush aside any theological objections. On his way to Saint Petersburg, Njegoš made stops in several Austrian cities. In Vienna, he met famed Serbian language reformer Vuk Stefanović Karadžić. Karadžić was greatly impressed with Njegoš, and in a letter to poet Lukijan Mušicki, he wrote: [...] "Petar Petrović is not yet twenty years old, but is taller and more handsome than any grenadier in Vienna. Not only does he know Serbian very well to read and write, but he also composes fine verse. He thinks that there is no finer language in the world than our popular tongue (and he's right <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> even if it were not true)." [...] Njegoš arrived in Saint Petersburg in March 1833 and was consecrated. After the ceremony, the czar granted Njegoš a total of 36,000 rubles, 15,000 of which were to make up for his travel expenses. Standing next to Njegoš as he gave his speech, the czar is said to have commented: [...] "My word, you're bigger than I am." [...] Grateful, the young vladika replied: [...] "Only God is bigger than the Russian czar!" [...] The czar promised Njegoš that Russia would intervene on Montenegro's behalf as if it were one of its own gubernias, while the Holy Synod vowed to provide all the necessary equipment and funds needed to maintain regular religious services in the country.|$|E
