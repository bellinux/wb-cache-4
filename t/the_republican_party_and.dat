5|$|The College Republican National Committee (CRNC) is a {{national}} organization for college and university students who support the Republican Party of the United States. The organization is known as an active recruiting tool for <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> has produced many prominent Republican and conservative activists and introduced more party members to the Republican party than any other organization in the nation.|$|E

5|$|Although Du Bois {{generally}} endorsed socialist principles, {{his politics}} were strictly pragmatic: in 1929, Du Bois endorsed Democrat Jimmy Walker {{for mayor of}} New York, rather than the socialist Norman Thomas, believing that Walker could do more immediate good for blacks, even though Thomas' platform was more consistent with Du Bois's views. Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support {{back and forth between}} <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> the Democratic Party, induced by promises from the candidates to fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting rights in the South; invariably, the candidates failed to deliver on their promises.|$|E

5|$|Before Stanton {{narrowed her}} {{political}} focus {{almost exclusively to}} women's rights, she was an active abolitionist with her husband Henry Brewster Stanton (co-founder of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party)</b> <b>and</b> cousin Gerrit Smith. Unlike many {{of those involved in}} the women's rights movement, Stanton addressed various issues pertaining to women beyond voting rights. Her concerns included women's parental and custody rights, property rights, employment and income rights, divorce, the economic health of the family, and birth control. She was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th-century temperance movement.|$|E
5|$|Election Special is the 2012 fifteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Ry Cooder. After his 2011 album Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, Cooder {{continued}} writing topical and storyline-inspired songs. Displeased with <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> {{its financial}} supporters, {{he also wanted}} to write an album that would address listeners during the United States presidential election of 2012, which he {{believed to be a}} critical event in the country's history. Election Special was recorded mostly at Drive-By Studios in North Hollywood and produced by Cooder.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{sought and}} gained the 1910 Republican gubernatorial nomination. At that time, {{the party was}} deeply divided between {{progressive}} and conservative wings, and could not defeat the united Democrats; he lost the election to incumbent Judson Harmon. Harry Daugherty managed Harding's campaign, but the defeated candidate did not hold the loss against him. Despite the growing rift between them, both President Taft and former president Roosevelt came to Ohio to campaign for Harding, but their quarrels split <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> helped assure Harding's defeat.|$|E

The Country of Law party was {{also a member of the}} governing coalition until it pulled out in May 2006. With 16 of the 131 seats in the National Assembly of Armenia, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation is the major socialist party in Armenia and the third-largest party in parliament.|$|E
5|$|Jason Chaffetz {{initially}} {{declared his}} candidacy to challenge McCarthy, and Bill Flores declared his candidacy after McCarthy withdrew, but both dropped out later {{to express their}} support for Paul Ryan, who entered the race after being widely viewed as a potential frontrunner. Daniel Webster of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> former Speaker Nancy Pelosi of the Democratic Party were also declared candidates. Ryan won the rescheduled caucus vote on October 28, and was elected Speaker of the House the next day, with 236 votes to Pelosi's 184 and Webster's 9. Three votes went to undeclared candidates.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect was}} to {{prohibit}} {{the use of}} public funds by any religious school, although it did not advance Grant’s other aim of requiring states to provide public education to all children. The bill passed the House but failed in the Senate. Although it never passed Congress, and left Blaine open to charges of anti-Catholicism, the proposed amendment served Blaine’s purpose of rallying Protestants to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> <b>and</b> promoting himself as one of the party’s foremost leaders.|$|E

5|$|After the election, Paul was speculated {{to run for}} {{president}} in 1992 but opted instead to work on the campaign for Pat Buchanan. That year, Marrou received the Libertarian presidential nomination. Paul later returned to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> was re-elected to his seat in Congress in 1996, without much support from establishment Republicans, who supported the party-switching Democratic incumbent of the seat. Back in Congress, Paul regained his nickname of Dr. No, favoring a free market and advocating a reduction {{in the size of the}} federal government. He was drafted to challenge President George W. Bush in the 2004 Republican primaries, but chose not to run. He ran {{for president}} again in 2008 and 2012 as a Republican, attracting a large amount of grassroots support.|$|E
5|$|Brown is {{a member}} of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> <b>and</b> faced the Democratic candidate, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley in the 2010 special election, which had {{occurred}} after the 2009 death of long-time Senator Ted Kennedy for the remainder of Kennedy's term ending January 3, 2013. While initially trailing Coakley in polling by a large margin, Brown saw a sudden late surge in the polls and posted a surprise win to become the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. Brown ran for a full Senate term in 2012, but lost to Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren. He subsequently joined {{the board of directors of}} Kadant paper company, joined Fox News as a commentator, and joined Nixon Peabody where he provided legal services.|$|E
5|$|Gillibrand's special {{election}} victory in 2010 {{gave her the}} right to serve the rest of Clinton's second term, which ended in January 2013. Gillibrand ran for a full six-year term in November 2012. In the general election, Gillibrand faced challenger Wendy E. Long, an attorney running on both <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> Conservative Party lines. Gillibrand was endorsed by The New York Times and the Democrat and Chronicle. She won the election with 72.2% of the vote, the largest victory margin for a statewide candidate in New York history, better than Schumer's 71.2% victory in 2004. She carried all counties except for two in western New York.|$|E

5|$|He {{enjoyed a}} {{successful}} post-war career {{working for the}} U.S. government as a diplomat, civil servant, and administrator. His conversion to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> his cooperation with his old friend, President Ulysses S. Grant, as well as critical comments {{he wrote in his}} memoirs about General Lee's wartime performance, made him anathema to many of his former Confederate colleagues. His reputation in the South further suffered when he led African-American militia against the anti-Reconstruction White League at the Battle of Liberty Place in 1874. Authors of the Lost Cause movement focused on Longstreet's actions at Gettysburg as a primary reason for the Confederacy's loss of the war. Since the late 20th century, his reputation has undergone a slow reassessment. Many Civil War historians now consider him among the war's most gifted tactical commanders.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, Sargsyan {{tightened}} {{his grip on}} the Armed Forces, establishing himself as a virtual strongman. After strongly supporting Ter-Petrosyan to retain power, he forced the president out of office in 1998 due to his support for concessions in the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement negotiations, and helped Prime Minister Robert Kocharyan to be elected president. With their relations deteriorated, Sargsyan merged the influential war veterans group Yerkrapah into <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> joined forces with Armenia's ex-communist leader Karen Demirchyan. In the May 1999 elections, their reform-minded alliance secured a comfortable majority in the National Assembly. Sargsyan became prime minister, emerging as the de facto decision-maker in Armenia with effective control of the military and the legislature.|$|E
5|$|Keyes first {{stated that}} he was {{considering}} leaving the Republican Party during a January 2008 appearance on The Weekly Filibuster radio show. He did not withdraw his candidacy after John McCain won the necessary 1,191 delegates to the Republican National Convention, {{even though he was}} no longer campaigning for the Republican nomination. On March 27, 2008, Keyes's campaign website began displaying the Constitution Party's logo, along with a parody of the trademarked GOP logo {{in the form of a}} dead elephant. This appeared to be an indication of Keyes's intentions to quit <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> <b>and</b> to begin officially seeking the Constitution Party's presidential nomination.|$|E

5|$|Thompson {{graduated}} from Jefferson College (now Washington & Jefferson College) in 1858 with a bachelor's degree, and studied {{for two years}} at the Western Theological seminary (now Pittsburgh Theological Seminary). In 1861, he was appointed professor of mathematics at Western College (now Leander Clark College), a United Brethren-affiliated college in Shueyville, Iowa, and taught there for one year. The United Brethren, a pietist church that arose first among Pennsylvania Germans during the Great Awakening, {{was one of the}} earliest churches in the United States to embrace abolitionism. By Thompson's time, they had also joined the fight for the prohibition of alcohol, though most did so from within <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> did not join the small single-issue Prohibition Party.|$|E
5|$|While the war {{was still}} being waged, Lincoln faced reelection in 1864. Lincoln was a master politician, {{bringing}} together—and holding together—all the main factions of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> <b>and</b> bringing in War Democrats such as Edwin M. Stanton and Andrew Johnson as well. Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket. At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party.|$|E
5|$|New {{polls in}} January {{indicated}} voter support was growing for Toomey, who now held a projected nine percentage point lead over Specter and an eight-point lead over Sestak. Specter continued to lead against Sestak in the Democratic primary poll, {{this time by}} a 21-point margin. Some political scientists believed Toomey's gain over Specter {{could be attributed to}} voter distrust of establishment candidates and growing dissatisfaction with the health care proposal pending in Congress. However, some Democratic leaders felt Sestak's challenge to Specter was having a detrimental effect not only to Specter, but to the Democratic party in general and their prospects for ultimately winning the general election. This feeling was enhanced by the growing national support for <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party,</b> <b>and</b> especially by the unexpected victory of the Tea Party-backed Republican Scott Brown in a special election for a traditionally Democratic Massachusetts Senate seat. Specter acknowledged to The New York Times that the national political mood might work against him in the primary, but insisted he was not discouraged and expressed confidence in his ability to survive.|$|E
