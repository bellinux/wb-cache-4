5|$|McNamara helped {{capture the}} school's first ever National Championship in 2003. McNamara started every game in his {{freshman}} year, helping lead the Orange to a 30-5 record, including a perfect 17-0 at home. He averaged 13 points, 4.6 assists and 2.2 steals a game while shooting 35 percent from 3-point range and 91 percent from <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|Originally {{a soccer}} player, Rolle {{did not play}} {{basketball}} until he was 15, when local coach Darrel Sears saw him walking across a basketball court and saw Rolle's great height. Sears asked if {{he knew how to}} play; Rolle said no. Sears asked him to try shooting from <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b> His first shot, according to Rolle, completely missed the backboard and fell into the bushes behind it. At the time Rolle was not interested in the game and only attended Sears' practices because free fried chicken was provided.|$|E
5|$|As a sophomore, Burke made 5 of 6 {{free throws}} in {{overtime}} {{to help his}} team defeat Dublin Scioto High School by a 54–53 margin in a 2009 OHSAA Division I regional final. In the state championship game, he made one of two free throws to give Northland a 58–56 lead with 27.6 seconds left in what became a 60–58 win over Princeton High School. He also made the pass {{to set up the}} final game-winning points, although they were scored from <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line</b> by Sullinger. During the championship season, Burke averaged 10.7 points and 9.1 assists, and made only 1.7 turnovers per game.|$|E
50|$|Foul {{territory}} or {{foul ground}} {{is defined as}} the area of the field outside of <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> and <b>foul</b> poles are not part of foul territory.|$|R
50|$|Fair {{territory}} or fair {{ground is}} defined as the area of the playing field between <b>the</b> two <b>foul</b> <b>lines,</b> and includes <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> themselves and <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> poles.|$|R

5|$|As an {{implement}} {{of war and}} hunting, javelin throwing began in prehistoric times. Along with the discus, the javelin was the second throwing event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon. Records from 708 BC show two javelin competition types co-existing: throwing at a target and throwing the javelin for distance. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives. In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an ankyle (thin leather strip) around the javelin that acted as a sling to facilitate extra distance. The javelin throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 19th century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men's competitions. The modern event features a short run up on a track and then the thrower releases the javelin before <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|A double {{is a safe}} hit {{in which}} the batter reaches second base without being called out. This {{scenario}} often occurs when a ball is hit into the gaps between the outfielders, or down <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line</b> {{on either side of}} the playing field. Tris Speaker is the all-time leader in doubles in MLB history, with 792, one of which was part of a cycle; Speaker accomplished the feat for the Boston Red Sox on June 9, 1912, against the St. Louis Browns. Two of the other top five players in MLB history in doubles have hit for the cycle: Stan Musial (725 doubles; third all-time) completed the cycle on July 24, 1949; and Craig Biggio (668; fifth all-time) accomplished the feat on April 8, 2002. The single-season MLB leader is Earl Webb, the left-handed outfielder who hit 67 in 1931.|$|E
5|$|In {{his sophomore}} season, Moore played 34games, {{starting}} five, and averaged 7.6points and 3.0rebounds per game. In the November17 game against Georgetown, with Temple maintaining a one point lead with 23seconds left, Moore missed {{the front end}} of a one-and-one foul shot. Afterwards, Greg Monroe of Georgetown hit a layup to give the Hoyas a 46–45 victory. The following game against Siena, Moore was at <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line</b> with a one-point lead and, with 22seconds left, hit both free throws to hand Temple a 73–69 victory. He increased his scoring average to 9.8points per game in conference play, receiving more minutes due to a head injury to teammate Juan Fernandez. On February20,2010, he scored a season-high 24points in an overtime victory over city rival Saint Joseph's, and made a critical fullcourt layup with 1.5seconds left to send the game into overtime. Moore helped Temple to a 29–5 record and a third consecutive Atlantic 10 conference tournament title and an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. He was named Atlantic 10 Sixth Man of the Year.|$|E
50|$|In baseball, {{there are}} two ways for a batted ball to be out-of-bounds. If a ball is hit between <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> and exits <b>the</b> field of play, it is a home run, at the batter and {{teammates}} who are on base run to home plate and score a point for their team. If the ball is hit outside <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> (such as to the side or behind the batter), it is a foul ball, and is equivalent to a strike. <b>The</b> <b>foul</b> ball bounds do not apply to fielders, who are allowed to try to catch a foul ball, which would put the batter out. While the rules of baseball define the angle of <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines,</b> there are no set rules as to how large a field should be, and it varies from baseball field to baseball field.|$|R
50|$|The outfield is the {{grassed area}} beyond the infield grass <b>line</b> between <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines,</b> and bounded {{by a wall}} or fence.|$|R

5|$|The Tar Heels {{defeated}} the Yale Bulldogs 9074 in the NCAA East Regional Quarterfinal {{in order to}} advance to the semifinal against Canisius College. North Carolina won the game by twelve points, which allowed them {{to move on to the}} NCAA East Regional Final against Syracuse. The final, along with the semifinal, were held at the Palestra in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Syracuse Orange fell to the Tar Heels 6758 as the Tar Heels advanced to the Final Four in Kansas City, Missouri. The Tar Heels opponent for the national semifinal was Michigan State. The Tar Heels were tied with the Spartans as time was winding down in regulation. Michigan State's Jack Quiggle made a half court shot that would have given the Spartans the lead, but the shot left his hands after time expired, nullifying the basket. In the first overtime, Michigan State had a two-point lead with eleven seconds remaining, while also having a player at <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b> The Spartan missed both shots and Tar Heel Brennan gathered the rebound, dribbled down the court, and made a shot as time expired to send the game to a second overtime. The Tar Heels pulled away in the third overtime to win the game 7470. The game saw the lead change thirtyone times before the Tar Heels were able to emerge victorious after three overtime periods.|$|E
25|$|On 31 January 2007, Laiho {{slid down}} the lane at a bowling alley after accidentally {{stepping}} over <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b> He slammed hard into the wall, breaking his left shoulder. This rendered him unable to play guitar for six weeks. Due to this incident, Children of Bodom was forced to cancel their first 2007 tours and a festival that they were slated to headline.|$|E
25|$|You {{hear a lot}} {{of third}} baseman raving about the hard chances they get, but any time the shortstop is looking for a berth that is nice and quiet and restful in {{comparison}} to his own he casts longing glances at third. Look up the records and see what becomes of the shortstops who get too old to cover all the ground between second base and <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b> A lot of them camp on third for a while. And why shouldn't they? A man can play third when he can't play short. That's a cinch.|$|E
50|$|The infield, {{containing}} the four bases, is for general defensive purposes bounded by <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> and within <b>the</b> grass line (see figure).|$|R

5000|$|Distances to {{the outfield}} wall were changed, most noticeably down <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines,</b> where <b>the</b> bullpens and the Bullpen Sports Bar are now located.|$|R
25|$|The {{conventional}} bowling footwork styles {{use either}} a four- or five-step approach beginning 8 to 16 feet (2.4 to 4.8 meters) behind <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b> In the typical four-step approach, {{the ball is}} {{pushed away from the}} body in step one; step two has the ball {{at the bottom of the}} backswing; in step three, the ball is at the top of the backswing; finally, the ball is swung forward and delivered in conjunction with the fourth and final slide-step. In a five-step approach, the bowler takes an initial timing step before pushing the ball away from the body.|$|E
25|$|In tournaments within {{countries}} like Taiwan where they use house conditions, spinning {{can be an}} advantage over rolling. However, when tournaments use the more conventional oil patterns, where the oil is laid from <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line</b> to about 40 feet, and is dry up to the pin rack, spinning loses its advantage since friction exists. Carry is also a more reliable and consistent technique of knocking pins down on the first ball, as spinning is less predictable in terms of pin deflection, and at times can result in odd leaves - including the 5-pin and wash-outs when missing the 1-pin.|$|E
25|$|In {{the top of}} the sixth, Allen hit a one-out {{double to}} the fence in center field. With two outs, Moore doubled to right, driving in Allen and {{narrowing}} Hilldale's lead to one run. In the bottom of the sixth, Hilldale had runners on first and third with one out, and Thomas hit a fly caught by Allen in short right near <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b> Carr tried to score from third, and was gunned down on the relay from Allen to Hawkins to Duncan. Kansas City's only hit in the last three innings was a one-out double by Duncan in {{the top of the}} seventh, so they were unable to catch Hilldale.|$|E
50|$|Foul poles, if present, help umpires {{judge whether}} a fly ball hit above <b>the</b> fence <b>line</b> is <b>foul</b> (out of play) or fair (a home run). The poles are a {{vertical}} extension of <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> at <b>the</b> {{edge of the}} field of play. The outer edge of <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> and <b>foul</b> poles define <b>foul</b> territory. Both <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> and the poles are in fair territory, in contrast to football and basketball, where the lines marking the playing boundaries are out of bounds.|$|R
50|$|Before {{remodeling}} and reconfiguration for the 2002 season, <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> were 343 (later 335) and {{the power}} alleys were 370 (later 375). Centerfield was 420 (later 408).|$|R
5000|$|The {{lines from}} home plate to {{first and third}} bases extend to the nearest fence, stand or other {{obstruction}} and are called <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> portion of the playing field between (and including) <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> is fair territory; the rest is [...] "foul territory." [...] The area {{in the vicinity of}} the square formed by the bases is called the infield; fair territory outside the infield is known as the outfield. Most baseball fields are enclosed with a fence that marks the outer edge of the outfield. The fence is usually set at a distance ranging from 300 to 420 ft from home plate. Most professional and college baseball fields have a right and left foul pole. These poles are at the intersection of <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> and <b>the</b> respective ends of the outfield fence and, unless otherwise specified within the ground rules, lie in fair territory. Thus, a batted ball that passes over the outfield wall in flight and touches <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> pole is a fair ball and the batter is awarded a home run.|$|R
25|$|There is {{an optimal}} bowling ball {{speed at which}} the player maximizes the chance to knock down all ten bowling pins. Optimal ball speed, which {{is defined as the}} time it takes for the ball to travel from one foot past <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line</b> to the head pin, is 2.3 seconds (this number can shift to 2.2 or 2.4 {{depending}} on the dryness or slickness of the lane). A ball that is rolled too fast will not give the pins enough time to “mix” with other pins, or in other words, to knock each other down in a domino effect motion. Conversely, a ball rolled too slowly will deflect too much and {{will not be able to}} knock down all the pins.|$|E
25|$|There are {{systematic}} ways {{of using}} the lane arrow marks and approach dots {{to make it easier}} to line up a shot, increasing consistency of hitting the pins at the correct location every time. For beginners, it also helps eliminate fear of the channels, and places the focus solely on the lane. Most bowlers are taught to utilize the arrows, as the arrows are nearer to the point where a hooking ball starts to hook back towards the pins. Other bowlers utilize the dots if they find themselves pulling their body up at <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line</b> (the shoulders should stay level throughout the entire approach,) as this is usually caused by them thinking that the arrows are too far out at the lane. Advanced players often use the lane boards themselves to line up shots that require them to aim between arrows.|$|E
25|$|For various formulaic purposes, {{physicists}} divide rotation {{into three}} components, assigning portions to x, y and z axis that are mutually perpendicular. For bowling, the x-axis {{can be assigned}} to a line that is parallel to <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line,</b> the y-axis to the line parallel to the boards, and the z-axis to the vertical. Forward-roll is rotation about the x-axis, side-roll is rotation about the y-axis and mid-roll (or spin) is rotation about the z-axis. The pure full-roller delivery {{is a combination of}} forward- and side-roll only. Semi-rollers include spin. Spinners may have very little side roll. In a very strict physics sense, a ball may be delivered with rotation, but usually not in a roll, because that would imply complete traction. The technique of the great majority of bowlers involves a delivery that starts the ball in a skid that evolves into a roll that hooks into the pins.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} capacity of Bannerwood Park is 300, {{but there is}} lots of room to stand and watch or sit in your own folding chair down <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> into <b>the</b> outfield.|$|R
50|$|When a ball is hit outside <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines,</b> it is a <b>foul</b> ball, {{requiring}} <b>the</b> {{batter and}} all runners {{to return to}} their respective bases, whether it is caught or not.|$|R
50|$|It {{is thought}} to be {{slightly}} friendlier to hitters than typical minor-league parks. Knights general manager Scotty Smith said that due to the limited lot size, <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> are a few feet shorter than minor-league guidelines.|$|R
25|$|The Jazz, {{who were}} undefeated {{at home in}} the postseason coming into the series, had their most {{cohesive}} effort in a 109-83 Game 3 rout. Utah pestered Duncan into early foul trouble and got baskets from players other than Williams and Boozer, who had combined for 57.7% of their team's points through the first two games. But Jazz fans' euphoria over the team's only series victory gave way to frustration in Game 4 – with most of it aimed at Ginóbili and his flopping. 11 of his 16 fourth-quarter points came at <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line</b> in an ugly overall team performance in which the Spurs made more free throws (30) than field goals (28). Contributing to that discrepancy were four technical fouls called against Utah in the fourth. The subsequent ejections of Utah headcoach Jerry Sloan and Jazz guard Derek Fisher had a charged-up EnergySolutions Arena crowd raining debris onto the court in protest.|$|E
25|$|Hansbrough {{collected}} a season-high 13 rebounds in the season-opener against the Detroit Pistons on December 26, with {{five of those}} coming at the offensive end. He had 10+ rebounds twice in the season's first three contests, but those were his only games in double figures, until having 10 boards against the Houston Rockets on April 1, 2012. He was second on the team with 226 free throws made and 278 attempts from <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b> He attempted 10+ free throws three times, including a high of 11 against the Miami Heat on January 4. He scored at least eight points {{in each of the}} season's first 11 games, hitting double-digits in nine of those. In that 11-game span, he averaged 12.2 points per game and had a streak of seven games in a row with 10+ points from December 30 to January 9. He scored in double figures just 20 times the rest of the season, including a season-best 22 points against the Charlotte Bobcats on February 22. The Pacers made it to {{the second round of the}} playoffs in 2012, where they were defeated by the eventual champion Miami Heat.|$|E
25|$|On June 25, 2009, Hansbrough was {{selected}} by the Indiana Pacers with the 13th overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft. After missing all of training camp, the preseason and the first four games {{of the regular season}} with an injury to his shin, he made his NBA debut against the Washington Wizards on November 6, 2009. He tallied 13 points against Washington, including 7-of-10 from <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b> At the time, he was just the second Indiana player to have attempted 10 or more free throws in a game. After averaging 3.8 rebounds per game in his first 14 appearances, he led the Pacers with 11 rebounds against the Portland Trail Blazers on December 9. In that game, he gathered a season-high seven offensive rebounds, tying Roy Hibbert for second most by any Indiana player in 2009–10. On December 11, he scored a season-high 21 points against the New Jersey Nets. On December 27, he made and attempted 10 free throws against the Miami Heat, becoming the first player in Pacers' history to record a double-double (10 points, 10 rebounds) without making a field goal. His final game of the season came on January 16, 2010, as he sat out 49 of the season's final 53 games with an inner ear infection.|$|E
50|$|A {{baseline}} is {{the straight}} line between two adjacent bases. Baselines are not {{drawn on the}} field, although <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> serve to mark the baseline between home plate and first base, and between third base and home.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} 1903 {{construction of}} Hilltop Park cost about $200,000, {{more than two-thirds}} of which was spent for rock blasting and excavations; and the groundskeeper of the Highlanders, Phil Schenck, laid out the playing field. The ballpark consisted of a covered grandstand of three sections, although it was not actually roofed until June 1 that season. Two sections of the grandstand were parallel to <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> and <b>the</b> third section was a short intermediate diagonal, which formed the backstop. The grandstand extended a short way past both first and third bases, and a clubhouse was located behind the center field fence. Single-deck bleachers that extended down both <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> reached from <b>the</b> grandstand almost to the fences. The third base bleachers were not finished until June 1903. These first and third base bleachers angled towards <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> reducing <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> area at <b>the</b> fences to about 15 feet. A modest-sized scoreboard was in fair territory down <b>the</b> left field <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> main entrance to the park was on Broadway and a ramp led {{up to the top of}} the first base grandstand. Unlike many of the other contemporary wooden ballparks-this one never burned.|$|R
50|$|The {{dimensions}} of the baseball field were 335 ft down <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines,</b> 380 ft to the power alleys and 408 ft to center field during the Senators' time. The official distances when the Nationals arrived were identical, except for two additional feet to center field. After complaints from Nationals hitters it was discovered in July 2005 that the fence had actually {{been put in place}} incorrectly, and it was 394.74 ft to the power alleys in left; 395 ft to the right-field power alley; and 407.83 ft to center field. The section of wall containing the 380 ft sign was moved closer to <b>the</b> <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> to more accurately represent the distance shown on the signs but no changes were made to the actual dimensions.|$|R
