5|$|Hidden Treasures is an EP by American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} on July 18, 1995 by Capitol Records. The album features songs that {{first appeared on}} movie soundtracks and tribute albums. Four of the tracks were released as singles, and <b>three</b> <b>have</b> received Grammy Award nominations for Best Metal Performance.

5|$|Little, Brown Books has {{published}} three Glee–related young adult novels, {{all of which}} were developed in collaboration with the show's producers and writers. All <b>three</b> <b>have</b> been written by Sophia Lowell; the first, Glee: The Beginning, was released in August 2010 and serves as a prequel to the events of the television series.

5|$|Of 19 {{species of}} native nestmaking {{bumblebees}} and six species of cuckoo bumblebees formerly widespread in Britain, <b>three</b> <b>have</b> been extirpated, eight are in serious decline, and only six remain widespread. Similar declines {{have been reported}} in Ireland, with four species designated endangered, and another two considered vulnerable to extinction. A decline in bumblebee numbers could cause large-scale changes to the countryside, resulting from inadequate pollination of certain plants.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{fourteen}} Prime Ministers who have held office since {{the introduction of}} the position in 1947, <b>three</b> <b>have</b> held office thrice, and one have held office twice. Five Prime Ministers have gone on to become President of the country. The current Prime Minister of Sri Lanka is Ranil Wickremesinghe, since 9 January 2015.|$|E

No state governor has yet resigned or died in office, nor did any territorial governor die in office. George Ariyoshi was the first Asian American to be governor of any U.S. state. The current governor is David Ige, who took office on December 1, 2014.|$|E

5|$|Pale {{crag martin}} pairs often nest alone, {{especially}} in the Sahara, although where suitable sites are available small loose colonies may form. This martin aggressively defends its nesting territory against conspecifics and other species. In Africa breeding dates vary geographically and with local weather conditions, but in northwest Africa February to April is normal, and in Asia nesting is from April to June. Two broods are common, and <b>three</b> <b>have</b> been raised in a season.|$|E
5|$|Several {{types of}} {{aquarium}} fish are called albino, e.g. albino driftwood catfish, albino festivium, albino red tailed shark and albino tiger shark, however, photographs {{of these four}} fish indicate that the latter <b>three</b> <b>have</b> dark eyes and/or pigmented fins.|$|E

5|$|The Flavians, {{although}} a relatively short-lived dynasty, helped restore stability to an empire on its knees. Although all <b>three</b> <b>have</b> been criticised, especially {{based on their}} more centralised style of rule, they issued reforms that created a stable enough empire to last well into the 3rd century. However, their background as a military dynasty led to further marginalisation of the senate, and a conclusive move away from princeps, or first citizen, and toward imperator, or emperor.|$|E
5|$|The {{wildcard}} (joker) {{system was}} introduced in 2004 to diversify the music featured. Four artists, one in each semifinal, were invited by SVT to enter a song of their choice into the competition, provided it does not breach the rules. The wildcard songs and artists were announced in January. Since the wildcards' introduction, <b>three</b> <b>have</b> won the competition. In 2011 there were 15 wildcards. The wildcard system was discontinued in 2013.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{a number of small}} items of {{uncertain}} function, described as toiletry pieces. Some are picks, others perhaps scrapers, and <b>three</b> <b>have</b> empty sockets at one end, which probably contained organic material such as bristle, to make a brush. The size of these would be appropriate for cleaning the teeth or applying cosmetics, among other possibilities.|$|E

5|$|There are {{possible}} etymological links between Wade's causeway and other UK archaeological sites: Wade's Gap on Hadrian's Wall in Northumbria; the Wansdyke that runs between Wiltshire and Somerset; and Wat's Dyke in the Welsh borders: all <b>three</b> <b>have</b> pre-modern origins {{and the latter}} two have sections contested as Roman in part.|$|E
5|$|Bryan Trottier, Denis Potvin and Mike Bossy {{have won}} {{four or five}} {{individual}} awards each. In 1978–79, Trottier led the NHL with 47 goals and 134 points, earning him the Art Ross Trophy and {{a spot on the}} NHL First All-Star Team. Trottier also received the Hart Memorial Trophy for being the most valuable player during the 1978–79 regular season. In the 1975–76, 1977–78, and 1978–79 regular seasons, Potvin was awarded the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the best defense player in the league. Bossy is a three-time winner of the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, an award given for gentlemanly conduct during the regular season. All <b>three</b> <b>have</b> won the Calder Memorial Trophy once, and have been on the NHL First All-Star Team at least twice. Trottier and Bossy have both won the Conn Smythe Trophy once, which is awarded to the most valuable player of the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Eight sacbe (causeways) {{have been}} located around Calakmul. Two {{of these have}} been mapped, <b>three</b> <b>have</b> been {{identified}} visually {{on the ground and}} three more identified with remote sensing. They have been numbered as Sacbe 1 through to Sacbe 7. The causeway network not only linked Calakmul with local satellite sites but also with more distant allies and rivals, such as the great cities of El Mirador, El Tintal and Nakbe. Those causeways that cross swampy land are elevated above the surrounding wetland and they now tend to support denser vegetation than the surrounding forest.|$|E

5|$|Five genetic {{types of}} HHT are recognized. Of these, <b>three</b> <b>have</b> {{been linked to}} {{particular}} genes, while the two remaining have currently only been associated with a particular locus. More than 80% of all cases of HHT are due to mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1. A total of over 600 different mutations is known. There {{is likely to be}} a predominance of either type in particular populations, but the data are conflicting. MADH4 mutations, which cause colonic polyposis in addition to HHT, comprise about 2% of disease-causing mutations. Apart from MADH4, it is not clear whether mutations in ENG and ACVRL1 lead to particular symptoms, although some reports suggest that ENG mutations are more likely to cause lung problems while ACVRL1 mutations may cause more liver problems, and pulmonary hypertension may be a particular problem in people with ACVRL1 mutations. People with exactly the same mutations may have different nature and severity of symptoms, suggesting that additional genes or other risk factors may determine the rate at which lesions develop; these have not yet been identified.|$|E
5|$|In the Islanders' inaugural season, three goaltenders {{played for}} the team: Billy Smith, Gerry Desjardins and Gerry Gray. Since then, 40 others have played {{in at least one}} regular season or playoff game. Smith stayed with the Islanders through 1989 and played in 675 regular season games and 132 playoff games, the most in the team's history. Additionally, he holds the records for most overall wins, with 304. Chico Resch has {{recorded}} the most shutouts with 25. Only fourteen have played in Islanders playoff games and of those, <b>three</b> <b>have</b> been on the roster during a Stanley Cup victory.|$|E
5|$|On this chart, {{films are}} ranked by the {{revenues}} from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, {{along with the}} highest positions they attained. Thirty-one films in total have grossed in excess of $1 billion worldwide, of which <b>three</b> <b>have</b> grossed over $2 billion, with Avatar {{ranked in the top}} position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.|$|E
