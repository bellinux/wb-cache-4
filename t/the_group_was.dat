40|$|In this paper, a <b>group</b> contest <b>is</b> analyzed, where <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> {{allowed to}} {{determine}} their sharing rules either sequentially or simultaneously. It is found that in case <b>the</b> more numerous <b>group</b> determines its sharing rule prior to <b>the</b> smaller <b>group,</b> rent dissipation in <b>the</b> <b>group</b> contest <b>is</b> higher than in an individual contest. However, if the order of moves <b>is</b> endogenized, <b>the</b> smaller <b>group</b> will always act prior to <b>the</b> bigger <b>group.</b> Competition between <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>is</b> in this way weakened and <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> able to save on expenditures. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{computational}} {{complexity of the}} isomorphism and equivalence problems on systems of equations over a fixed finite group. We show that the equivalence problem is in P if <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> Abelian, and coNP-complete if <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> non-Abelian. We prove that if <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> non-Abelian, then <b>the</b> problem of deciding whether two systems of equations over <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>are</b> isomorphic <b>is</b> coNP-hard. If <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> Abelian, then <b>the</b> isomorphism problem is graph isomorphism hard. Moreover, if we impose the restriction that all equations are of bounded length, then we prove that the isomorphism problem for systems of equations over finite Abelian <b>groups</b> <b>is</b> graph isomorphism complete. Finally we prove {{that the problem of}} counting the number of isomorphisms of systems of equations is no harder than deciding whether there exist any isomorphisms at all...|$|R
