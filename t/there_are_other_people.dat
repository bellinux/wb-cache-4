The people called them 'Ajjhayaka' which meant 'They who don't meditate'. At first the Ajjhayaka were viewed lower than Jhayaka but in the Buddha's time, the Ajjhayaka had been viewed higher in status than the Jhayakas.|$|E
500|$|He was not {{a typical}} movie actor, with a pudgy build and lacking matinée idol looks, but Hoffman claimed that he was {{grateful}} for his appearance as it made him believable {{in a wide range}} of roles. Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, [...] "The bad news is that Philip won't be a $25-million star. The good news is that he'll work for the rest of his life". The Aiken Standard of South Carolina referred to him as an [...] "anti-star", whose real identity remained [...] "amorphous and unmoored". Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters. He remarked, [...] "I'm sure that people in the big corporations that run Hollywood don't know quite what to do with someone like me, but that's OK. I think <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who are interested in what I do." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first time}} she was asked about her mother's {{handling}} of the Lewinsky scandal at a campaign stop Clinton responded, [...] "I {{do not think that}} is any of your business." [...] As she became a more experienced campaigner, she refined her responses and deflected questions on the issue with comments such as, [...] "If that's what you want to vote on, that's what you should vote on. But I think <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> [...] going to vote on things like healthcare and economics." ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> too, just as {{important}} as the Whimsies, whom the clever old Nome had determined to win to his side.|$|R
6000|$|Fanny laughed. [...] "I suppose <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> too, {{that had}} romantic {{attachments}} for Miss Costigan," [...] she said: [...] "I don't {{want to hear}} about 'em." ...|$|R
60|$|But the miscreant {{was evidently}} on the watch, Briot still lingered {{on the top}} of the stairs, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> {{sleeping}} in the house, and St. Genis suddenly realised that his purpose would not be quite so easy of execution as he had hot-headedly supposed.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} we were all trying to find out who the hell we were as individuals, what we wanted {{specifically}} on our own terms, who we wanted to be, what our potentials were, what our differences were, what made us unique… And I think that's why the XXX-rated films were important, because it was like, Oh, my God, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who like the same things as me, like leather, or being blown on a pool table. [...] It was a start—literally stripping ourselves naked and trying to begin from there.Second, he [...] "wasn't comfortable in his own skin" [...] and wanted some adventure in his life.|$|E
2500|$|Darley and Latané (1968) {{conducted}} research on diffusion of responsibility. The {{findings suggest that}} in the case of an emergency, when people believe that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> around, they are less likely or slower to help a victim because they believe someone else will take responsibility. People may also fail to take responsibility for a situation depending on the context. They may assume that other bystanders are more qualified to help, such as doctors or police officers, and that their intervention would be unneeded. They may also be afraid of being superseded by a superior helper, offering unwanted assistance, or facing the legal consequences of offering inferior and possibly dangerous assistance. For this reason, some legislations, such as [...] "Good Samaritan Laws" [...] limit liability for those attempting to provide medical services and non-medical services in an emergency.|$|E

5000|$|... "When I {{was quite}} young I once accidentally tuned in {{on a radio}} {{broadcast}} from an Arabian station. I was thunderstruck: I became deeply aware that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> living on this earth, living in thoroughly different conditions, having other thoughts and feelings" [...] (Ton de Leeuw, 1978).|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Gauls, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>peoples</b> living in Gaul, such as the Greeks and Phoenicians who had established outposts such as Massilia (present-day Marseille) along the Mediterranean coast. Also, along the southeastern Mediterranean coast, the Ligures had merged with the Celts to form a Celto-Ligurian culture.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in {{and around}} Thorbury, who very much wanted to know {{something}} about the young man at Cobhurst, but this desire was interfered with {{by the fact that the}} young man was not yet at Cobhurst, and did not seem to be in a hurry to get there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush! not so loud. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> lodging in the house. Never {{mind about}} {{telling me what}} you heard; it only irritates you to no purpose. I can guess that they had discovered--" ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> {{who will}} tell you that Greek art is fine, because it is not true; and carves a lion's skin so as to look not at all like a lion's skin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{never mind}} her; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> very talkative {{in this town}} besides your wife. Deacon Abraham's house is half a mile {{out of your way}} home from Mr. Jordan's. How did you get there?" ...|$|E

5000|$|The American Synesthesia Association {{was created}} in 1995 by Carol Steen and Patricia Lynne Duffy after discovering, through {{correspondence}} with Simon Baron-Cohen, that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the New York metropolitan area who experienced synesthesia. The ASA {{was born out of}} a desire to meet other synesthetes, and to improve communication between synesthetes and researchers.|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} {{a quarter of an hour}} after this when Kitty {{proposed}} that we should go out to the front of the house; it would look queer if any of the servants should come by and see us sitting together like that. I had forgotten that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the world, but I went with her.|$|R
6000|$|... "You must understand, Mr. Low, that Mr. Finn {{is a man}} horribly hated {{by certain}} enemies. That wretched Mr. Bonteen hated his very name. But <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who think very {{differently}} of him. He must be saved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he {{answered}} smiling, [...] "that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> {{who would have}} something to say about that. Your stepmother is already anxious. I have promised that you shall be back at the Hall by ten o'clock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Age, my dear Mrs. Macallan, is {{a purely}} {{relative}} expression," [...] he said. [...] "There {{are some people}} who are never young, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who are never old. I am one of the other people. Au revoir!" ...|$|E
60|$|His voice ceased. He did not cry, {{only went}} on {{speaking}} monotonously. Clara wanted to run. She looked round. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> the black, re-echoing shore, {{the dark sky}} down on her. She got up terrified. She wanted to <b>be</b> where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> light, where <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people.</b> She wanted {{to be away from}} him. He sat with his head dropped, not moving a muscle.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> many <b>other</b> <b>people</b> besides Brown whose {{notion of}} {{originality}} {{would seem to}} be precisely similar.|$|R
50|$|United States v. Nathaniel Solon was {{a lawsuit}} where Nathaniel Solon, a Casper citizen, was convicted for {{possession}} of child pornography. The case became known in the media by irregularities in the process, and suspicions (affirmed by the defendant) that the material was introduced by malware on the computer. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> accused of similar crimes, who were later acquitted, but Solon was never exonerated.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is a shame," [...] said Miriam, [...] "that you should be driving to town alone, when <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who wish so much to go, and you have no use at all for that empty seat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, mynheer," [...] I interrupted; [...] "but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in {{the world}} besides yourself--Hernan Pereira, for example, if he lives. Still, I am {{not the only one}} {{concerned}} in this matter. There is Marie yonder. Shall I call her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I quite {{agree with}} you," [...] he said, helping {{himself to a}} crumpet, [...] "there are some people with small incomes {{who seem to be}} always in funds, just as <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> with large incomes who are always hard-up. The former are really rich, the latter really poor." ...|$|E
5000|$|Speaking of his {{photos of}} the Indian Congress, Merry Foresta, {{director}} of the Smithsonian Photography Initiative at the Smithsonian Institution said, [...] "Rinehart's portraits are really quite extraordinary and put him above the average workaday photographer who might have also made photographs for similar reasons. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> working, {{but he seems to}} have really, because of the quality of his work, stood apart." ...|$|R
500|$|Several {{songs on}} Diorama were {{inspired}} by Johns' then-girlfriend Natalie Imbruglia, but he cautioned against possible misinterpretations of the songs, stating [...] "Everyone will think that any lyric that's about someone {{in a positive light}} will be about her" [...] and noting that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> he cared for about whom he wrote the songs. Johns denied rumours that he had written songs intending Imbruglia to sing them.|$|R
5000|$|Rooster Teeth was {{initially}} {{unaware of the}} broader machinima movement. In 2004, Co-producer Matt Hullum stated {{in an interview with}} GameSpy, [...] "When we first started Red vs. Blue we thought we were completely original. We never imagined that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> out <b>there</b> using video games to make movies, much less that it was a new art form with a hard to pronounce name and an official organization." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gwendolen. Yes, but {{men often}} propose for practice. I know my brother Gerald does. All my girl-friends tell me so. What wonderfully blue eyes you have, Ernest! They are quite, quite, blue.

6000|$|... "One {{ought not}} to wish it to go on, because <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> and other duties," [...] said Meta, [...] "but {{quietness}} is so peaceful. Do you know, Ethel, I shall always think of those two first days, before anybody came, with you and Dr. May, as something very--very--precious," [...] she said at last, with the tears rising.|$|E
6000|$|And then, because Buster Bear always {{enjoys a}} good joke {{even when it}} is on himself, he laughed until he had to hold his sides, which is a whole lot better than going off in a rage as Little Joe Otter had done. [...] "You're pretty smart, Mr. Otter! You're pretty smart, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who are smart too," [...] said Buster Bear, and still chuckling, he went off to think up a plan to get the best of Little Joe Otter.|$|E

6000|$|After she {{had left}} Florence Gilbert Osmond met Madame Merle at the Countess Gemini's. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> present; the Countess's drawing-room was usually well filled, and the talk had been general, {{but after a while}} Osmond left his place and came and sat on an ottoman half-behind, half-beside Madame Merle's chair. [...] "She wants me to go to Rome with her," [...] he remarked in a low voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{went down}} to the town with Jarge, who was going to fetch some things I wanted. He left her looking in at a shop window while he went inside. They were some time serving him as <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the shop. Jenny got tired, as she says, of waiting, and seeing some {{pictures}} in a window {{on the other side of}} the street started to run across, and her foot slipped, and--and--" ...|$|R
