In 2011, the Toronto Star wrote: “The show is easily <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> now on stage in Vegas!” That year the show attracted an estimated $150 million in ticket sales. The show currently has a ten-year performance contract that runs through 2019, and was the best selling magic show in Las Vegas as of 2013.|$|E

Shortly after arriving in London in 1966, Hendrix visited Marshall's music shop demanding an amp setup like Townshend's and manipulated electronic noises in ways that Townshend had pioneered. The Beatles were fans and socialised with Moon in particular during the mid-1960s. In 1965, Paul McCartney said the Who [...] "are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> around" [...] and was inspired to write [...] "Helter Skelter" [...] in the group's [...] "heavy" [...] style; John Lennon borrowed the acoustic guitar style in [...] "Pinball Wizard" [...] for [...] "Polythene Pam".|$|E

500|$|Ryan Cracknell of Apollo Movie Guide, while {{echoing the}} praise for Holden's performance, {{nonetheless}} {{found that the}} film [...] "doesn't hold up so well today". Citing {{what he sees as}} slow pacing and [...] "long bouts of over-the-top dialogue", Cracknell compares the film to [...] "reading a textbook – not <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> in the world, but it does provide insights into and perspectives on the foundation of early horror movies and how many similarities carry over into movies half a century and more later." [...] Michael W. Phillips, Jr. concurs, calling the film [...] "a marked improvement on the original film [...] still a bit of a snooze, relying too much on forced comedy and not enough on suspense or fright." [...] Phillips again praises Holden's performance and also Pichel's portrayal of Sandor, but finds the rest of the cast weak.|$|E
500|$|Harrison taped {{the basic}} track for {{his version of}} [...] "Far East Man" [...] at Friar Park over August and September 1974, during {{sessions}} for his album Dark Horse. Having [...] "brushed up the lyrics a bit", {{as he puts it}} in I, Me, Mine, Harrison retained Newmark and Weeks from the sessions with Wood, and brought in keyboard player Billy Preston and saxophonist and arranger Tom Scott, both of whom would also be part of his all-American tour band. Leng describes [...] "Far East Man" [...] as [...] "the first Harisong to tap into 1970s soul" [...] and notes the [...] "supreme soul credentials" [...] of Newmark, as the former drummer with Sly and the Family Stone, and Weeks, who had supplied the highly regarded basslines on Donny Hathaway Live (1972). Newmark later recalled of his and Weeks' first sessions for Harrison: [...] "We were completely thrilled to be asked to play on his record … It was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> to happen to me.

2500|$|Hurdzan's {{career in}} golf {{actually}} began at his elementary school {{years when he}} was a caddie; he later became a greenkeeper to ASGCA past president and Ohio Historical Society inductee Jack Kidwell, and was a golf course superintendent before transitioning to a golf course architect. Howard Richman wrote that Hurdzan said that {{the first time he saw}} an overhead photo with the overlay of a golf course, was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> for him. Hurdzan was influenced by Jack Kidwell and Geoffrey Cornish; according to Richman, [...] " [...] believes if there were two saints on earth they had to be architects Geoff Cornish and Kidwell." [...] He told Richman, [...] "Jack would take me to superintendent meetings, and I knew enough to keep my mouth shut and listen. I listened to all of the old-timers' stories and learned."

2500|$|In 2001, {{the band}} {{released}} White Blood Cells. The album's stripped-down garage rock sound drew critical acclaim in the US and beyond, making The White Stripes {{one of the}} more acclaimed bands of 2002, and forefront figures in the garage band revival of the time. John Peel, an influential DJ and the band's early advocate in the UK, said they were <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> he'd heard since Jimi Hendrix. The New York Times said of White, [...] "beneath the arty facade lies one of the most cagey, darkly original rockers to come along since Kurt Cobain." [...] The album was followed up in 2003 by the commercially and critically successful Elephant. The critic at Allmusic wrote that the album [...] "sounds even more pissed-off, paranoid and stunning than its predecessor ... darker and more difficult than White Blood Cells." [...] The album's first single, [...] "Seven Nation Army", became the band's signature song, reaching number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart for three weeks, winning the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Rock Song, and becoming an international sporting and protest anthem. The band's fifth album, Get Behind Me Satan, was recorded in White's own home and marked a change in the band's musical direction, with piano-driven melodies and experimentation with marimba and a more rhythm-based guitar playing by White.|$|E

60|$|Now all around, behind {{trees and}} stumps, and under thick branches, {{and even in}} tree tops, were other little people {{watching}} with round, wide-open eyes {{to see what would}} happen. It was very exciting, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> they could remember. You see, they had come to believe that Farmer Brown's boy wasn't afraid of anybody or anything, and as most of them were very much afraid of him, they had hard work to believe that he would really be afraid of even such a great, big, strong fellow as Buster Bear. Every one was so busy watching Farmer Brown's boy that no one saw Buster coming from the other direction.|$|E

Where the spectators see an assault on an already beaten man, the fighter himself only sees a legitimate piece of self-defence against an opponent whose chances are equal to his own. Psmith saw, as anybody looking on would have seen, that Adair was done. Mike's blow had taken him within a fraction of an inch of the point of the jaw, and he was all but knocked out. Mike could not see this. All he understood was that his man was on his feet again and coming at him, so he hit out with all his strength; and this time Adair went down and stayed down.|$|E

60|$|As to the shawl-dance, it was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> {{that ever}} was beheld; {{there was such}} a whisking, and rustling, and fanning, and getting ladies into a tangle with {{artificial}} flowers, and then disentangling them again! And as to Mr. Augustus Cooper’s share in the quadrille, he got through it admirably. He was missing from his partner, now and then, certainly, and discovered on such occasions to be either dancing with laudable perseverance in another set, or sliding about in perspective, without any definite object; but, generally speaking, they managed to shove him through the figure, until he turned up in the right place. Be this as it may, when he had finished, a great many ladies and gentlemen came up and complimented him very much, and said they had never seen a beginner do anything like it before; and Mr. Augustus Cooper was perfectly satisfied with himself, and everybody else into the bargain; and ‘stood’ considerable quantities of spirits-and-water, negus, and compounds, for the use and behoof of two or three dozen very particular friends, selected from the select circle of five-and-seventy pupils.|$|E

It sounds instead like {{an extension of}} the hoary oratorio form popular in Victorian Britain ... with its plethora of hymn-like numbers interspersed with ballads of no particular interest and some strong ensembles." [...] Traubner continues, [...] "Sullivan's score would have been wonderful for a film, with its numerous Korngoldian fanfares and stirring, very English-national choruses. The long drinking scene in act 1, with its 'Glory to those who fight for the true Cross', and the 'Ho, Jolly Jenkin' ensemble with Friar Tuck, also referring to drinking, are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>things</b> in <b>the</b> opera.
