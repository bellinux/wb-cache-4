5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end}} of the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E
5|$|Luscombe Castle is {{a country}} house {{situated}} near the resort town of Dawlish, in the county of Devon in England. Upon purchasing the land at Luscombe in 1797, Charles Hoare demolished the existing house and commissioned architects John Nash and Humphrey Repton to design a new house and gardens at the site. Nash and Repton {{came up with an}} asymmetrical designed building made from Portland stone, with castellated parapets, turrets and pinnacles to create <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> picturesque castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was constructed of Portland stone, largely over two storeys {{but with a}} three story octagonal tower between the two wings, {{as well as a}} square tower to the north above the porte-cochère. The walls feature castellated parapets, turrets and pinnacles, giving the building <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> castle in the gothic style. The building has an asymmetric feel, in a picturesque style, with varying shapes and elevations to different sections. The intent was to give a castle style to the building, reminiscent of historical fortresses, but with the comfortable interior of a house.|$|E
50|$|In addition, most {{digital pianos}} often {{incorporate}} a simulated key weight mechanism in which <b>the</b> lower notes <b>feel</b> heavier than <b>the</b> higher notes, vaguely replicating <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> actual piano.|$|R

5|$|BioWare {{produced}} Neverwinter Nights (2002) for Atari, {{the first}} CRPG to fuse the third-edition Dungeons & Dragons rules with a 3D display {{in which the}} user could vary the viewing angle and distance. New game content could be generated using the Aurora toolset supplied {{as part of the}} game release, and players could share their modules and play cooperatively with friends online. Based in part on experiences while playing Ultima Online, one of the goals during development was to reproduce <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> live pen-and-paper RPG experience, complete with a human Dungeon Master. Neverwinter Nights (NWN) was very successful commercially, and spawned three official expansion packs and a sequel developed by Obsidian Entertainment. BioWare later produced the acclaimed , which married the d20 system with the Star Wars franchise; as well as the original Jade Empire (2005), Mass Effect (20072012) and Dragon Age (20092014) series, all which were released for multiple platforms. With the Mass Effect and the Dragon Age titles, Bioware also utilized a save import system where decisions in the earlier games impact the story in the later games.|$|E

25|$|Construction of 72 private {{boxes in}} 1985 {{increased}} the seating capacity to 56,926, and a 1990 addition of 36 additional boxes and 1,920 theatre-style club seats brought {{the number to}} 59,543. In 1995, a $4.7 million project put 90 more private boxes in the previously open north end zone, again giving the stadium <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> complete bowl and increasing capacity to 60,890.|$|E
25|$|Demi-pointe {{shoes are}} most often used to train dancers who are new to pointe technique. They serve to {{acclimate}} dancers to the feel of wearing pointe shoes and to strengthen the ankles and feet in preparation for dancing en pointe in pointe shoes. The toe box allows the dancer to experience <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pointe shoe, while the insole and outsole work together to provide the resistance needed for developing foot and ankle strength.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to other games developed by Blizzard, Hearthstone was an experimental game {{developed by a}} smaller team based on the appreciation of collectible card games at the company. The game was designed to avoid pitfalls of other digital collectible card games by eliminating any possible plays from an opponent during a player's turn and by replicating <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> physical card game within the game's user interface. Many of the concepts as well as art assets were based on those previously published in the physical World of Warcraft Trading Card Game.|$|E
5000|$|Compensation {{points are}} {{sometimes}} preferred to stones because the players {{would like to}} play or practice {{as if it is}} an even game. They would like to have <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> [...] "even game". White (the stronger player) must play better to overcome these disadvantages (points gained by playing first + compensation points).|$|R
50|$|The first {{buildings}} {{at the zoo}} were made of local stone and built by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). These buildings {{were built in the}} 1930s and were home to primates, reptiles, birds, and big cats. They are still in use, and the cat house was renovated into <b>a</b> restaurant with <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> African style lodge.|$|R

He noted that elements of foreign music were also present in platinum beats music.|$|R
25|$|Observation of most pornographic or artistic nude {{material}} {{before that}} decade {{and from the}} advent of the filming or photography camera, would show most if not all the performers or models with their own pubic hair differences of growth, with no signs of invested rejection or manipulated discrimination. The presentation is regarded by some as being erotic and aesthetic, while others consider the style as unnatural. Some people remove pubic hairs for erotic and sexual reasons or because they or their sex partner enjoy <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hairless crotch.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{inmates were}} housed in cells {{that could only}} be {{accessed}} by entering through a small exercise yard attached {{to the back of the}} prison; only a small portal, just large enough to pass meals, opened onto the cell blocks. This design proved impractical, and in the middle of construction, cells were constructed that allowed prisoners to enter and leave the cell blocks through metal doors that were covered by a heavy wooden door to filter out noise. The halls were designed to have <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> church.|$|E
25|$|For a {{young or}} green (inexperienced) horse, longeing {{is used to}} teach a horse to respond to voice {{commands}} and the trainer's body language, to accustom them to <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> saddle and bridle, and to begin their introduction to the feel of reins and bit pressure. In many training stables, a horse is first introduced on the longe to nearly everything {{it is going to}} be asked to do under saddle, including movement at all gaits, response to hand and voice commands (called riding aids), and remaining calm in unusual or stressful situations.|$|E
50|$|The comic largely {{follows a}} character-based narrative, mixing drama and light humor that {{sometimes}} {{borders on the}} surreal. With some swearing and partial nudity, it greatly relies on the juxtaposition of the two protagonists, {{as well as their}} relationships with and the relationships between other characters. Octopus Pie has <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> indie comic, focusing on young urbanites, usually from Gen Y.|$|R
50|$|Macandrew Bay is <b>a</b> suburb <b>of</b> Dunedin, but has <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{isolated}} coastal {{settlement and}} is often regarded as a separate township, even though {{the heart of the}} city is visible 10 kilometres away at the head of the harbour.

25|$|The Andrew Carnegie birthplace {{museum at}} the corner of Moodie Street and Priory Lane is {{dedicated}} to the well-known businessman and philanthropist. The museum is made up of two buildings; the weaver's cottage, his birthplace and the memorial hall which tells his life story. Annual heritage walks organised by the museum take place each summer. The Abbot House heritage centre on Maygate {{tells the story of the}} history that the house played within Dunfermline over a period of five and a half centuries. There is also a cafe on the ground floor and part of the garden recreates <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 17th-century herb garden.|$|E
25|$|Over {{six hundred}} Old Newingtonians enlisted during World War I {{and the loss}} of life was appalling. By war's end, 109 Old Boys had died for God, King and Country. Prior to 1920 the walls of the {{vestibule}} {{at the entrance to the}} Founders Wing had been hung with sporting teams photographs. In 1921 this space was transformed by the installation of white marble tablets, encased in Queensland maple, upon which were inscribed the names of Old Boys who had served. Those who had made the supreme sacrifice are listed on the central panels below the words: These Nobly Strining, Nobly Fell. With a black and white marble floor and stained glass door panels this space takes on <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small chapel.|$|E
25|$|Kitano's 2010 film Outrage was {{screened}} at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. He {{admitted he}} tried something different for Outrage {{by adding a}} lot of dialogue, stepping back as the main character to make an ensemble piece, and having <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nature documentary watching the characters kill each other. A sequel, 2012's Outrage Beyond, was screened in competition at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. He also appeared in Yasuo Furuhata's 2012 film, Dearest. In September 2012, Takeshi Kitano said that the producers wanted {{him to make a}} third Outrage film depending on the box office. On 7 March 2013, Minkei News of Hong Kong reported that Kitano won the Best Director award for Outrage Beyond at the 7th Asian Film Awards in Hong Kong.|$|E

50|$|Though Newnham {{has changed}} {{enormously}} {{over the past}} 250 years, it retains <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> archetypal southern English village, though few farmworkers still live there. Fast railway connections to London and the continent of Europe add to the appeal with jobs in Ashford, Canterbury, Maidstone and Medway within easy reach {{after the completion of}} the M20, M2, M26 and M25 between the mid-1960s and early 1990s.|$|R

25|$|Other {{aspects of}} the game's {{interface}} were set to replicate <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> physical game being watched by an audience: Hearthstone starts with the player opening a box, during gameplay the cards waver and move while in their hand, and cards when played slam down on the board. When attacking, cards leap across the board to strike the target; when a massive spike of damage is dealt, the board shakes; when a massive creature is summoned, an unseen audience gasps in awe. Hearthstone also offers interactive boards. The boards on which the cards are played can be interacted with in various ways, such as virtually petting a dragon, although the feature is purely for entertainment and {{has no effect on}} gameplay. This idea came out from the movie Jumanji in which a board game comes to life, and also mimics how physical card players would often toy with their cards while waiting on their opponent.|$|E
500|$|In 2016, the M+ in Hong Kong {{commissioned}} Wong {{to create}} the [...] "M+ Rover" [...] – a mobile gallery for their schools outreach programme.
