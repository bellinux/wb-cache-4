50|$|The {{rectilinear}} comb uses a circular comb {{mounted on a}} drum to comb out the fringe and remove short fiber (set by a scale so fibers less than, for example, 25 mm are removed) not held by a clamping mechanism. The row of pins known as a <b>top</b> <b>comb</b> is a very fine tooth comb, for example 25 teeth per inch; it is inserted in cylindrical combed fringe {{to act as an}} impediment to contaminates (burr, seed etc.) flow. The <b>top</b> <b>comb</b> acts as an impediment to contamination moving into a combed sliver. On a next circular combing short finer and contaminates are removed. The circular combing without short fibers are placed on a moving belt in an overlapping motion. The circular combing and <b>top</b> <b>comb</b> insertion is repeated and combed fibers - now called tuft are overlapped. The overlapping produces some cohesion allowing the tuft then to be twisted to form a combed sliver. This sliver is weak and unsuitable for spinning. To allow spinning to take place additional gilling is required to introduce fiber end irregularity (Sokolov 1994).|$|E
50|$|Because it is carded, the fibres {{are less}} {{parallel}} than <b>top</b> (which is <b>combed)</b> {{and are not}} of uniform length.

50|$|Combing is {{a method}} for {{preparing}} carded fiber for spinning. Combing is divided into linear and circular combing. The Noble comb {{is an example of}} circular combing. The French comb is an example of linear combing. The process of combing is accompanied by gilling, a process of evening out carded or <b>combed</b> <b>top</b> making it suitable for spinning. Combing separates out short fibers by means of a rotating ring or rectilinear row of steel pins. The fibers in the 'top' it produces have been straightened and lie parallel to each other. When combing wool, the discarded short fibers are called noils, and are ground up into shoddy.|$|R

25|$|A tightly {{spun wool}} yarn made from fibre {{with a long}} staple length in it is called worsted. It is hand spun from <b>combed</b> <b>top,</b> and the fibres all lie in the same {{direction}} as the yarn. A woollen yarn, in contrast, is hand spun from a rolag or other carded fibre (roving, batts), where the fibres are not as strictly aligned to the yarn created. The woollen yarn, thus, captures much more air, and makes for a softer and generally bulkier yarn. There are two main techniques to create these different yarns: short draw creates worsted yarns, and long draw creates woollen yarns. Often a spinner will spin using a combination of both techniques and thus make a semi-worsted yarn.|$|R

5000|$|To {{measure the}} {{fineness}} of sheep wool fiber before microscopes and lasers were so used, English wool handlers {{in the city}} of Bradford described wool by estimating (with experienced eyes) how many 560-yard hanks of single strand yarn could be made by a good spinner from a pound of [...] "top." [...] (<b>Top</b> is cleaned <b>combed</b> wool with the fibers all parallel) The finer the average diameter of a single wool fiber, the more hanks could be spun.

25|$|The machines, {{known as}} boxes, {{in the drawing}} section reduce the <b>combed</b> <b>tops</b> from thick slivers to thinner roving ready for spinning. This is done by {{drafting}} them between slow back rollers to faster front rollers, and controlling the fibres between these rollers. The first boxes where the ends are thickest are the double head can gill box (where the wool ends up in a can) and the 2-spindle gill box (where the wool ends up twisted and on spindles). On these machines the rollers are heavily fluted to control the sliver, and the front rollers padded with leather to cushion the wool. Between {{the front and back}} rollers are fallers or bars which control the roving by holding it with fine pins. The roving is now called slubbing which needs twist for strength, and is dealt with by a second set of boxes: a 2-spindle draw-box, 4-spindle weigh box, 8-spindle finisher/reducer and 8-spindle rover. In these boxes the principle of two sets of rollers with controlled fibre in between is the same, but the yarn is now twisted onto a bobbin via a flyer.|$|R
40|$|Eri silk {{produced}} by Philosamia cynthia ricini silkworm is a fibre not well-known to the silk industry, {{in spite of}} the fact that Eri silk is finer, softer, and has better mechanical and thermal properties than most animal fibres. Eri silk has a high commercial potential, as the host plants of Eri silk worms are widespread in diverse geographical locations, and the worms also have a higher degree of disease resistance than most other silk worms. Mills are often not aware of the properties of Eri for designing appropriate end products. Thus, Eri silk yarn is traditionally {{produced by}} hand spinning, and Eri silk usually ends up as material for handwoven shawls. The potential for bulk fibre processing and the development of soft luxurious novel Eri silk products is yet to be discovered. To better understand the material and its processing behaviour, Eri silk was characterised and cocoons were processed into tops through degumming, opening, and cutting filaments into different lengths, followed by a worsted spun silk processing route. Fibre properties such as fineness, crimp, strength and length at different processing stages up to <b>combed</b> <b>tops</b> were measured. The results indicate that staple Eri silk can be processed via the worsted topmaking route, using a cut length of 200 mm or 150 mm for filament sheets prepared from degummed cocoons. <br /...|$|R
5000|$|Intermediate {{stages in}} the {{transition}} from the old beekeeping to the new were recorded for example by Thomas Wildman in 1768/1770, who described advances over the destructive old skep-based beekeeping so that the bees no longer had to be killed to harvest the honey. Wildman for example fixed a parallel array of wooden bars across the top of a straw hive or skep (with a separate straw top to be fixed on later) [...] "so that there are in all seven bars of deal" [...] a 10 in [...] "to which the bees fix their combs." [...] He also described using such hives in a multi-storey configuration, foreshadowing the modern use of supers: he described adding (at a proper time) successive straw hives below, and eventually removing the ones above when free of brood and filled with honey, so that the bees could be separately preserved at the harvest for a following season. Wildman also described a further development, using hives with [...] "sliding frames" [...] for the bees to build their comb, foreshadowing more modern uses of movable-comb hives. Wildman's book acknowledged the advances in knowledge of bees previously made by Swammerdam, Maraldi, and de Réaumur—he included a lengthy translation of Réaumur's account of the natural history of bees—and he also described the initiatives of others in designing hives for the preservation of bee-life when taking the harvest, citing in particular reports from Brittany dating from the 1750s, due to Comte de la Bourdonnaye.However, the forerunners of the modern hives with movable frames that are mainly used today are considered the traditional basket <b>top</b> bar (movable <b>comb)</b> hives of Greece, known as “Greek beehives”. The oldest testimony on their use dates back to 1669 although it is probable that their use is more than 3000 years old.|$|R
5000|$|On March 22, the Times-Independent ran {{an article}} titled: [...] ""Piute Band Declares War on Whites in Blanding (sic)", the article {{also said that}} county commissioners had {{requested}} permission from Utah Governor Charles Mabey to allow {{the use of a}} military scout plane to bomb and strafe the natives. This was not approved. A $100 reward was placed on Posey's head by the state, dead or alive. C. F. Sloane of the Salt Lake Tribune was in Blanding at the time and wrote hideously inaccurate reports of the situation. Sloane wrote that Blanding was surrounded for [...] "thirty-six hours of terrorism," [...] with Utes in [...] riding through the streets. He also claimed that Posey was forming a [...] "mobile squadron," [...] to rob the San Juan State Bank and that there were [...] "sixty men skilled in the art of mountain warfare awaiting the call to service." [...] On one occasion, a citizen of Blanding asked a newsman why he wasn't writing the truth, the newsman responded, saying; [...] "We're not ready to go home yet, and if we don't keep something going, we'll be getting a telegram to come home." [...] Rumors began to circulate that another Indian war was about to begin so the Mormon settlers in Blanding and Bluff reacted quickly and mobilized a larger, mounted, posse to find Posey and his followers. They also tried to suppress any outside interference which had caused problems during the earlier conflicts. The posse trailed the chief's band and quickly caught up with them the next day, twenty miles from Blanding, inside a rugged area of desert strewn with canyons. The natives fought an unsuccessful rear guard action, from the <b>top</b> of <b>Comb</b> Ridge, to allow the women and children time to escape. All eventually surrendered though, {{over the course of the}} next few days. Posey escaped, but he was wounded by a bullet in one of his hips by a settler named Bill Young while trying to evade capture. Again the newspapers created their own versions of the story, one said that Posey was killed in a flash flood that washed him down a canyon, another said that he died of natural causes, being that he was in his sixties. Many Utes believed poisoned Mormon flour was the culprit but it is generally accepted that Posey died from blood poisoning caused by the gunshot wound. During the fighting, which lasted until March 23, Posey allegedly shot and killed the son of Joe Bishop when the two began to argue on top of the ridge. Posey was said to have been angry that Bishop's son and the other boy had caused so much trouble. Other accounts say the Bishop boy was killed by the posse.|$|R
40|$|Context Several key {{performance}} indicators of macro-economic conditions and public finances show a positive evolution or a sustained above-EU-average performance in recent years, such as for the budget deficit and unemployment. Other structural trends are confirmed, such as the declining share of industry in value added and the high importance of SME’s in the economy. In terms of integration in global value chains, Belgium has seen a light improvement {{in recent years in}} its world export shares in goods and services. Productivity has grown and is comparable (or better) than in many other EU countries. For its political and regulatory environment, Belgium keeps reporting good but not leading scores. For its digital economy, Belgium is part of the ‘lagging ahead’ cluster of countries. The use of information and communication technologies to deliver government services is increasing, as reflected in Belgium’s position on e-government rankings. R&I Actors - summary Belgium is characterized by a well-developed Triple Helix. Besides 17 federal scientific institutes, many regional research centers and collaborative platforms {{play a key role in}} the innovation ecosystem, such as the strategic research centers (Flanders), the competitiveness poles (Wallonia), the Bridge platforms (Brussels) and the collective centers (both in Flanders and Wallonia). The major part of the scientific output is delivered by the universities, while more than half of domestic expenditures on R&D in Belgium is financed by the business sector. R&I Challenges Any assessment of the R&I system in Belgium should take into account that, while Belgian research and innovation performance is not at the top in the EU, the country has managed to consolidate its position of a strong innovator over many years. In line with this observation, the policy mix and focus of policy effort have not changed dramatically over the last five years or even, it could be argued, over a decade. While most of R&D&I policy is devised and implemented at the level of the regions and communities, the innovation challenges are formulated at the echelon of the entire country. In other words, they constitute a common denominator of the challenges at the subnational level. Challenge 1 : Promote fast growing enterprises in innovative sectors With a share of employment in high-growth enterprises of only 5. 9 %, Belgium is well under the EU average of 9. 1 %, ranking 23 rd in the EU. In addition, many fast-growing Belgian firms do not operate in innovative sectors, but in sectors such as construction and transport. Given the growth challenge facing Belgium – and Europe as a whole – and the pivotal role of high-growth, innovative SMEs, increasing their prevalence is a key policy challenge. In Wallonia, the Marshall Plan 4. 0 envisages fomenting the creation of enterprises through the "entrepreneurial generations 2015 - 2020 " project, the further development of competitive clusters based on the ‘Competitiveness Poles’, and new instruments that foster the creation of innovative enterprises. An example of the latter is W. IN. G, an equity platform for financing the growth of digital start-ups. The Walloon Small Business Act is a comprehensive plan to stimulate the creation and growth of SMEs, amongst other by improving access to finance, with the "charte bancaire" as an example of a concrete initiative. In Flanders, an important strategic decision that is expected to strengthen the creation of innovative start-ups, is the merger of two strategic research centres (imec and iMinds), <b>combing</b> <b>top</b> research in microelectronics with expertise in software and business incubation. Other measures addressing the challenge include the “SME growth subsidy”, which was created in 2016. In the Brussels Capital Region, knowledge transfer from academia to business is supported, amongst others through the Bridge programme. Enabling mechanisms are also further developed, such as financing of innovative companies through the Brussels Regional Investment Company (S. R. I. B.) and hosting and incubation structures provided by Citydev. At federal level, various tax incentives for R&D are in place to create an attractive fical climate for R&d intensive companies, including start-ups. A key measure is the partial exemption of the wage withholding for researchers, which strengthens the demand for highly qualified staff, tying it to the 2 nd innovation challenge. Challenge 2 : Addressing the expected shortage of human resources for R&I While the labour force in Belgium is generally well-qualified, the share of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) graduates is low at 15. 7 % compared to the EU 28 average of 25. 4 %. Although the share of STEM students in total inflow in higher education has shown an increasing trend in recent years, demand exceeds the number of graduates. Shortages in these fields are considered as a potential major barrier for future innovation and economic growth and are already emerging for certain functions, such as ICT experts. More generally, there is a skill mismatch in the labour market, which is mainly related to an undersupply of highly-skilled job-seekers and to an over-representation of low-skilled job seekers. The Country Specific Recommendations for Belgium of June 2016 highlight the continued importance of human capital policy to boost the capacity to innovate. This challenge is closely intertwined with the first one, since the presence of fast-growing firms in innovative sectors crucially depends on highly qualified human capital in the domains of IT, biotech, material science, etc. As mentioned in the 1 st challenge, the federal government's influence over this policy domain is only indirect, but nonetheless important. Through fiscal measures it exerts a substantial influence on the demand for highly skilled workers, in particular through the policy of a reduced wage withholding tax for researchers, which will be continued in the coming years. The Marshall Plan 4. 0 in Wallonia aims to better align the supply of graduates in Wallonia to business needs, amongst others through the set-up of an inventory of "professions of the future". In order to attract external talent, the region has also introduced mechanisms like the "Beware Fellowships" to attract foreign talent. In Flanders, joint efforts involving the policy domains of science and innovation on the one hand, and education and training on the other, have been launched to increase the number of secondary students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM subjects) and encourage them to opt for a career in exact sciences or technology. The "STEM Action Plan 2012 - 2020 " has, among others, resulted in the STEM Monitor, an indicator dashboard that systematically tracks inflow into, and successful completion of, STEM studies at various levels of education. The "STEM Charter" is rolled out on a large scale and already brings together more than 50 companies and organisations which have indicated that they lend their full support to the STEM initiative. Finally, policy attention in all regions has also increasingly turned towards attracting foreign researchers or researchers from the own Community that are active abroad, through schemes like Odysseus and Pegasus 2 (Flanders), Ulysse (Wallonia) and Attract (Brussels). status: accepte...|$|R
