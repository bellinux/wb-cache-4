25|$|<b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>presidential</b> {{elections}} in the Academy (and also elections of the presidium) were organized on September 25—28, 2017. Initially the event was planned for March 2017, but unexpectedly all candidates retracted their nominations, and the elections were postponed.|$|E
25|$|An April 1995 {{referendum}} {{extended his}} term until 2000. He was re-elected in January 1999 {{and again in}} December 2005. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe criticised <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>presidential</b> election as falling short of international democratic standards. On 18 May 2007, the Parliament of Kazakhstan approved a constitutional amendment which allowed the incumbent president—himself—to run for an unlimited number of five-year terms. This amendment applied specifically and only to Nazarbayev: the original constitution's prescribed maximum of two five-year terms will still apply to all future presidents of Kazakhstan.|$|E
25|$|Two of the {{candidates}} for president in the 2004 race called Austin home. Michael Badnarik, the Libertarian Party candidate, and David Cobb of the Green Party both had lived in Austin. During the run up to the election in November, a presidential debate {{was held at the}} University of Texas at Austin student union involving the two candidates. While the Commission on Presidential Debates only invites Democrats and Republicans to participate in televised debates, the debate at UT was open to all presidential candidates. Austin also hosted one of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>presidential</b> debates between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton during their heated race for the Democratic nomination in 2008.|$|E

25|$|King was the {{informal}} de facto Federalist nominee {{for president in}} 1816, losing in a landslide to James Monroe. The Federalist Party became defunct {{at the national level}} after 1816, and King was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>presidential</b> nominee the party fielded. Nonetheless, King was able to remain in the Senate until 1825 due to a split in the New York Democratic-Republican Party. After that King accepted John Quincy Adams's appointment to serve another term as ambassador to Britain, but ill health forced King to retire from public life, and he died in 1827. King had five children who lived to adulthood, and he has numerous notable descendants.|$|E
25|$|The {{voter turnout}} for this {{election}} was broadly predicted {{to be high}} by American standards, and {{a record number of}} votes were cast. The final tally of total votes counted was 131.3 million, compared to 122.3 million in 2004 (which also boasted the highest record since 1968, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>presidential</b> election before the voting age was lowered to 18). Expressed as a percentage of eligible voters, 131.2 million votes could reflect a turnout as high as 63.0% of eligible voters, which would be the highest since 1960. This 63.0% turnout rate is based on an estimated eligible voter population of 208,323,000. Another estimate puts the eligible voter population at 213,313,508, resulting in a turnout rate of 61.6%, which would be the highest turnout rate since 1968.|$|E
25|$|Bush's {{greatest}} area {{of strength}} {{was in the}} South, where he won most states by wide margins. He also performed {{very well in the}} Northeast, winning Maine (where he had a residence), New Hampshire (at the time a Republican stronghold), Vermont (at the time a bastion of moderate Republicanism), and Connecticut (where his father Prescott Bush had been a senator). Bush lost New York by a margin of just over 4%. He also won Delaware, a swing state at the time. Despite the presence of Lloyd Bentsen on the Democratic ticket (and other Texans getting prominent roles at the Democratic convention), Bush won Texas by 12 points. He lost the Pacific northwestern states but kept California in the Republican column for the sixth straight time, however the margin was rather narrow as he won it by 3.57% a sign of the state moving more to the left. This was, to date, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>presidential</b> election in which a Republican candidate won California.|$|E

25|$|In April 1816 {{he ran for}} Governor of New York {{and lost}} to Daniel D. Tompkins. In the fall of that year, he did become the {{informal}} presidential nominee for the Federalist Party, as they did not meet for any convention. He only received 30.9% and lost again, this time to James Monroe, whose running mate, coincidentally, was Tompkins. King would be <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>presidential</b> candidate by the Federalists before their collapse. When he ran for re-election to the Senate in 1819, he ran as a Federalist even though the party was already disbanding and had only a small minority in the New York State Legislature. But, due to the split of the Democratic-Republicans, no successor {{was elected to the}} U.S. Senate in 1819, and the seat remained vacant until January 1820. Trying to attract the former Federalist voters to their side at the next gubernatorial election in April 1820, both factions of the Democratic-Republican Party now supported King, who served another term in the U.S. Senate until March 4, 1825. At the time the Federalist Party had already ceased to exist on the federal stage. During his second tenure in the Senate, he continued his career as an opponent of slavery, which he denounced as anathema to the principles underlying the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. In what is considered the greatest speech of his career, he spoke against admitting Missouri as a slave state in 1820.|$|E

2500|$|With {{an overall}} record turnout of 83.8%, a level not {{achieved}} since the 1965 presidential election when turnout was 84.8%, {{the vast majority}} of the electorate decided not to stay home. Most of them decided against protest votes, and chose the vote utile (tactical voting, literally [...] "useful vote"), that is, a vote for one of the purported leaders of the electoral race (Nicolas Sarkozy, Ségolène Royal and/or François Bayrou). The [...] "Anyone But Sarkozy" [...] push benefited both Bayrou and Royal, while the tactical voting, on the right or on the left, explains the low score of the other candidates, in contrast with <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>presidential</b> election's first round.|$|E

More cameras would be set up than had filmed <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>Presidential</b> inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers". The major networks broadcast some of the March live, though they interspersed footage of interviews with politicians.

2500|$|In 1982, the Parliamentary seat {{representing}} {{her home}} region of Nyeri was open, and Maathai decided {{to campaign for}} the seat. As required by law, she resigned her position with the University of Nairobi to campaign for office. The courts decided that she was ineligible {{to run for office}} because she had not re-registered to vote in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>presidential</b> election in 1979. Maathai believed this to be false and illegal, and brought the matter to court. The court was to meet at nine in the morning, and if she received a favorable ruling, was required to present her candidacy papers in Nyeri by three in the afternoon that day. The judge disqualified her from running on a technicality. [...] When she requested her job back, she was denied. As she lived in university housing and was no longer a staff member, she was evicted.|$|E

2500|$|Free speech zones {{were also}} used in New York City at the 2004 Republican National Convention. According to Mike McGuire, a {{columnist}} for the online anti-war magazine Nonviolent Activist, [...] "The policing of the protests during the 2004 Republican National Convention represent another interesting model of repression. The NYPD tracked every planned action and set up traps. As marches began, police would emerge from their hiding places– building vestibules, parking garages, or vans– and corral the dissenters with orange netting that read 'POLICE LINE– DO not CROSS,' establishing areas they ironically called 'ad-hoc free speech zones.' One by one, protesters were arrested and detained – some for nearly two days." [...] Both the Democratic and Republican National parties were jointly awarded a 2005 Jefferson Muzzle from the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression, [...] "For their mutual failure to make the preservation of First Amendment freedoms a priority during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>Presidential</b> election".|$|E

60|$|For {{purposes}} of comparison we may give {{some idea of}} the forces which Mr. Kruger and Mr. Steyn could put in the field. The general press estimate of the forces of the two republics varied from 25,000 to 35,000 men. Mr. J. B. Robinson, a personal friend of President Kruger's and a man who had spent much of his life among the Boers, considered the latter estimate to be too high. The calculation had no assured basis to start from. A very scattered and isolated population, among whom large families were the rule, is a most difficult thing to estimate. Some reckoned from the supposed natural increase during eighteen years, but the figure given at that date was itself an assumption. Others took their calculation from the number of voters in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>presidential</b> election; but no one could tell how many abstentions there had been, and the fighting age is five years earlier than the voting age in the republics. We recognise now that all calculations were far below the true figure. It is probable, however, that the information of the British Intelligence Department was not far wrong. No branch of the British Service has come better out of a very severe ordeal than this one, and its report before the war is so accurate, alike in facts and in forecast, as to be quite prophetic.|$|E
60|$|For {{purposes}} of comparison we may give {{some idea of}} the forces which Mr. Kruger and Mr. Steyn could put in the field, for by this time it was evident that the Orange Free State, with which we had had no shadow of a dispute, was going, in a way which some would call wanton and some chivalrous, to throw in its weight against us. The general press estimate of the forces of the two republics varied from 25,000 to 35,000 men. Mr. J. B. Robinson, a personal friend of President Kruger's and a man who had spent much of his life among the Boers, considered the latter estimate to be too high. The calculation had no assured basis to start from. A very scattered and isolated population, among whom large families were the rule, is a most difficult thing to estimate.

We recognise now that all calculations were far below the true figure. It is probable, however, that the information of the British Intelligence Department was not far wrong. According to this the fighting strength of the Transvaal alone was 32,000 men, and of the Orange Free State 22,000. With mercenaries and rebels from the colonies they would amount to 60, 000, while a considerable rising of the Cape Dutch would bring them up to 100,000. In artillery they were known to have about a hundred guns, many of them (and the fact will need much explaining) more modern and powerful than any which we could bring against them. Of the quality of this large force {{there is no need to}} speak. The men were brave, hardy, and fired with a strange religious enthusiasm. They were all of the seventeenth century, except their rifles. Mounted upon their hardy little ponies, they possessed a mobility which practically doubled their numbers and made it an impossibility ever to outflank them. As marksmen they were supreme. Add to this that they had the advantage of acting upon internal lines with shorter and safer communications, and one gathers how formidable a task lay before the soldiers of the empire. When we turn from such an enumeration of their strength to contemplate the 12,000 men, split into two detachments, who awaited them in Natal, we may recognise that, far from bewailing our disasters, we should rather congratulate ourselves upon our escape from losing that great province which, situated as it is between Britain, India, and Australia, must be regarded as the very keystone of the imperial arch.|$|E
