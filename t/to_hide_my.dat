500|$|In September 2000, {{she joined}} the ABT Studio Company, which is ABT's second company, and {{became a member of}} its Corps de ballet in 2001. As part of the Studio Company, she {{performed}} the Pas de Deux in Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Eight months after joining the company, she was sidelined for nearly a year by a lumbar stress fracture. When Copeland joined the company, she weighed [...] (she is [...] tall). At age 19, her puberty had been delayed, a situation common in ballet dancers. After the lumbar fracture, her doctor told her that inducing puberty would help to strengthen her bones, and he prescribed birth control pills. Copeland recalls that in one month she gained 10 pounds, and her small breasts swelled to double D-cup size: [...] "Leotards had to be altered for me ... to cover my cleavage, for instance. I hated this sign that I was different from the others. ... I became so self-conscious that, {{for the first time in}} my life, I couldn’t dance strong. I was too busy trying <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>my</b> breasts." [...] Management noticed and called her in to talk about her body. The professional pressure to conform to conventional ballet aesthetics resulted in body image struggles and a binge eating disorder. Copeland says that, over the next year, new friendships outside of ABT, including with Victoria Rowell and her boyfriend, Olu Evans, helped her to regain confidence in her body. She explained, [...] "My curves became an integral part of who I am as a dancer, not something I needed to lose to become one. I started dancing with confidence and joy, and soon the staff at ABT began giving me positive feedback again. And I think I changed everyone’s mind about what a perfect dancer is supposed to look like." [...] During her years in the corps, as the only Black woman in the company, Copeland also felt the burden of her ethnicity in many ways and contemplated a variety of career choices. Recognizing that Copeland's isolation and self-doubt were standing in the way of her talent, ABT's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, asked writer and arts figure Susan Fales-Hill, then vice-chair of ABT's Board of Directors, to mentor Copeland. Fales-Hill introduced Copeland to Black women trailblazers who encouraged Copeland and helped her to gain perspective.|$|E
2500|$|Critics have {{singled out}} {{the sixth and}} final season as {{the worst of the}} series. Lineberger remarked, [...] "I haven't {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>my</b> disappointment with this season. For the first time ever in my life as a Highlander enthusiast, I found myself utterly uncaptivated." [...] Oliver awarded the sixth season a score of 3.9 out of 10, saying: [...] "Like The X-Files, Highlander: The Series simply went on too long. If the star is wanting {{to get out of a}} show as much as Paul was ready to hang up his katana, then I say let it go." ...|$|E

Because I know that guys like Soros {{have been doing it}} for years, if not decades. And they stay below the radar by creating a network of corporations to funnel their money. I have my own philosophy and I'm not ashamed of it. I gave the money because there is no other legal way to do it.

2500|$|Martinez wrote a 1992 guest {{column in}} the Oakland Tribune: [...] "When I walk around nude, I am acting how I think it is {{reasonable}} to act, not how middle-class values tell me I should act. I am refusing <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>my</b> dissent in normalcy even though it is very easy to do so." [...] Martinez, who typically attended classes wearing only sandals and a backpack, became a cause célèbre at the university for a while, participating in a number of nude events on campus and performances by the Bay Area nude performance group the X-Plicit Players. He appeared on national talk shows, was profiled in a photo essay in Playgirl and was parodied in the 1994 college comedy PCU. As a response to [...] Martinez's actions, UC Berkeley issued its [...] "Policy Statement Concerning Public Nudity and Sexually Offensive Conduct" [...] banning public nudity on December 7, 1992.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{artists have}} cited Fripp as an {{influence}} or have expressed their admiration for him, including Steven Wilson, Omar Rodríguez-López,Omar Rodríguez-López: Selvfølgelig ikke! Jeg gjør faktisk ingen forsøk på å skjule min affekt for Fripps arbeider. [...] ble jeg introdusert for King Crimson, og på nytt kollapset alt, men på en konstruktiv måte. [...] Fripp tryllet i alle fall fram de vakreste toner jeg hadde hørt, og han kunne ikke ha gitt seg til kjenne på et mer gunstig tidspunkt i mitt liv. [...] Ingen kan nekte for at Robert Fripp, også helt tidlig i karrieren, var opptatt av jazz eller de blå notene. Durskalaer og oppstemte gjengroprefrenger har aldri appellert til meg, så da King Crimson ble meg til del var det som å smake på en bit av himmelriket. (Q: You can't deny that you're influenced by Robert Fripp and King Crimson, right?Omar Rodríguez-López: No, of course not! I make no attempt <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>my</b> affection for Fripps work. [...] I {{was introduced to}} King Crimson and again everything collapsed, but in a constructive way. [...] Fripp made the most beautiful notes that I had heard, and he couldn't have been introduced to me at a better time in my life. [...] As soon as someone discovers jazz, it will influence their approach irrespective of which style or band the person concerned contributes to. It can't be denied that Robert Fripp was into jazz throughout his career or the blue notes. The major-scales and euphoric stadium-rock choruses have never appealed to me so when I got familiar with King Crimson's music it was like getting a taste of heaven.) }} Trey Anastasio of Phish, St. Vincent, Kirk Hammett of Metallica,Kirk Hammett: There are fewer 30-part orchestrated guitar sections, fewer massive, bludgeoning riffs perfectly replicated by lames. There are more flexible ideas, more artistic flourishes, more colors. I've probably been influenced in that direction by people like Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew and David Torn. I'm more interested in using guitar sounds as textures and using effects in a more textural fashion. To paraphrase Robert Fripp, I'm more interested in painting a soundscape like he and Adrian Belew do in King Crimson, on Bowie records and in Fripp's solo stuff. Fripp {{is one of the}} most interesting guitar players I've ever heard--and I've just discovered him! }} Michael Angelo Batio, Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche, Nels Cline of Wilco, Adam Jones of Tool, Merzbow, Vernon Reid of Living Colour, Ben Weinman of The Dillinger Escape Plan, Paul Masvidal of Cynic, Steve Stevens of Billy Idol, Chris Haskett of Rollins Band, Ivar Bjørnson of Enslaved, Dylan Carlson of Earth, Dan Briggs, Denis [...] "Piggy" [...] D'Amour of Voivod, Daniel Mongrain, Marcus Henderson, Paul Lemos of Controlled Bleeding, Richard Pinhas,Richard Pinhas: [...] As a music composer, it would be Robert Fripp and King Crimson, yet I was more incensed by [...] Evening Star and the first one, No Pussyfooting.

What I like about that is that without a blueprint, it’s just really weird music. Robert Fripp is an astonishingly good guitar player. Just doing the wierdest shit. You listen to the guitar in ‘Fashion’ and you’re like, ‘What the fuck is that?’ He played on Scary Monsters, Low and I think Lodger as well. Low is one of my favorite albums ever. }} [...] electronic musician Rustie, film director Hal Hartley, and Sean Beavan.|$|E
