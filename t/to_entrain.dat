5|$|After {{their arrival}} in the United Kingdom, the {{battalion}} was transported by rail {{to the south of}} England where it set up a camp at Lopcombe Corner, on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire. Amidst the backdrop of the Battle of Britain, the battalion's personnel used their integral Vickers machine-guns and Bren guns to provide self-defence against air attack and to bolster the anti-aircraft defences of local areas. They also undertook training exercises and formed a mobile striking force tasked with rapidly responding {{in the event of an}} invasion. In September, the 18th Brigade was transferred to the 9th Division. On 14 October the battalion moved to Meeanee Barracks in Colchester, Essex, where it took over responsibility for a defence sector from a British officer training battalion. The 2/9th remained in Colchester until 10 November when orders came for the 18th Brigade to hand over to the 25th Brigade, and the 2/9th was relieved by the 2/31st Battalion. With the threat of invasion passing as winter came, the decision was made to redeploy the Australians to North Africa where they might be actively employed in combat operations. Following this, preparations for embarkation began as orders were received for the battalion <b>to</b> <b>entrain</b> for Glasgow where, on 15 November 1940, it boarded HMT Strathaird.|$|E

25|$|Although {{primarily}} {{composed of}} flowing snow and air, large avalanches {{have the capability}} <b>to</b> <b>entrain</b> ice, rocks, trees, and other surficial material. However, they are distinct from mudslides which have greater fluidity, rock slides which are often ice free, and serac collapses during an icefall. Avalanches are not rare or random events and are endemic to any mountain range that accumulates a standing snowpack. Avalanches are most common during winter or spring but glacier movements may cause ice and snow avalanches {{at any time of}} year. In mountainous terrain, avalanches are among the most serious objective natural hazards to life and property, with their destructive capability resulting from their potential to carry enormous masses of snow at high speeds.|$|E

40|$|Circadian rhythms {{possess the}} ability <b>to</b> robustly <b>entrain</b> <b>to</b> the {{environmental}} cycles. This ability {{relies on the}} phase synchronization of circadian rhythm gene regulation to different environmental cues, of which light is the most obvious and important. The elucidation of the mechanism of circadian entrainment requires an understanding of circadian phase behavior. This article presents two phase analyses of oscillatory systems for infinitesimal and finite perturbations based on isochrons as a phase metric of a limit cycle. The phase response curve of circadian rhythm can be computed {{from the results of}} the analyses. The application to a mechanistic Drosophila circadian rhythm model gives experimentally testable hypotheses for the control mechanisms of circadian phase responses and evidence for the role of phase and period modulations in circadian photic entrainment...|$|R
25|$|Early in April 1915, the Northumbrian Division was {{informed}} that it would shortly be sent to France, and on 16 April it began <b>to</b> <b>entrain</b> for the ports of embarkation (Southampton and Folkestone). The division completed its concentration {{in the vicinity of}} Steenvoorde on 23 April. It was thrown into action the very next day at the Battle of St Julien, taking up positions along the Yser Canal and then counter-attacking. The infantry of the division were involved in bitter fighting. Meanwhile, the divisional engineers were left at Steenvorde, but from 26 April they were sent up each night to work on a new defence line near Hill 60, to which the division retired on the night of 2–3 May.|$|E
25|$|Heavy rains fell in December 1999 {{along the}} north-central coast of Venezuela, {{culminating}} {{in a period of}} extreme intensity from 14 to 16 December. Starting around 8 PM local time (AST) on 15 December, runoff entered channels and rushed towards the sea, picking up and depositing sediments on its way. Generally after this first wave of flooding, from the coast to just past the crest of the Sierra de Avila, these rains triggered thousands of shallow landslides that stripped soil and rock off of the landscape and sent them slipping down the mountainside. Additional water liquefied these landslides into debris flows, which are granular flows in which water mixes with high concentrations of rock and mud. The first eyewitness accounts of debris flows were from 8:30 PM on the 15th, and the final debris flows were reported between 8 and 9 AM on 16 December. Many catchments released multiple debris flows, some of which carried large boulders and tree trunks onto the alluvial fan deltas. Starting between 7 and 9 AM on the 16th and continuing until late that afternoon, a new wave of floods occurred. These floodwaters were less concentrated in sediment and were therefore able <b>to</b> <b>entrain</b> new material and incise new channels into the flood and debris flow deposits from the previous days.|$|E
500|$|Following a {{pass through}} the storm by a United States Navy {{reconnaissance}} plane, Ethel was declared a [...] "severe hurricane" [...] with winds reaching 115mph (185km/h), equivalent to a modern-day Category3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.

However, shortly thereafter, cool, dry air began <b>to</b> <b>entrain</b> the storm, causing it to rapidly weaken. In a six-hour span, the storm suddenly weakened to a Category1 hurricane, a decrease of 25mph (110km/h).|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{battalion}} was stretched across several locations, with companies being formed in Seymour, Victoria, Brighton, Tasmania, and Northam, Western Australia. The Tasmanians and Western Australians had initially been intended {{to join the}} 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion, and during its formative period, the companies completed basic training in their home locations, before concentrating together at Warradale, South Australia with the Tasmanians sailing to Melbourne to link up with Victorians prior <b>to</b> <b>entraining</b> for the journey west, while the Western Australians crossed the Nullarbor Plain. At this point, the unit's establishment was completed, as {{the battalion}} structure was finalised. It was structured {{along the same lines}} as the other 2nd AIF machine gun battalions, which consisted of between 800 and 900 personnel organised into a headquarters element consisting of three platoons– signals, anti-aircraft and administration– and four machine gun companies, each equipped with 12 Vickers machine guns, to make a total of 48 across the entire battalion. Within the machine gun companies there were three platoons; these were numbered sequentially starting from 1 to 3 in Headquarters Company through to 13 to 15 in 'D' Company. A Light Aid Detachment of electrical and mechanical engineers was also attached.|$|R
40|$|Ohriner (this volume) empirically {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} listeners <b>to</b> rhythmically <b>entrain</b> <b>to</b> performances of Chopin's mazurkas and suggested that performers can manipulate listeners' expectations and influence their perceived musical tension by using eccentric or unpredictable patterns of tempo variation. In this commentary, I attempt to situate Ohriner's research in a broader context, while elaborating on his findings and proposing alternative interpretations in some cases. I suggest that, although mazurkas are particularly suitable {{for a study of}} entrainment due to their clear metrical structure, it would be appropriate to study musical genres in which the metrical structure is obscure or even absent. I also question Ohriner's interpretation of a lack of synchronicity as being predominantly associated with negative emotions. Furthermore, in order to examine more rigorously the influence of synchronicity on perceived musical tension, I present a controlled experimental design to disentangle the effects of tempo and rubato, which would involve measuring both entrainment and musical tension while asking participants to rate the perceived eccentricity of the performances...|$|R
40|$|A {{method has}} been devised for observing both {{circadian}} and noncircadian rhythms {{in a single}} wild type strain of Neurospora crassa. This method allows a direct comparison of {{the properties of the}} two types of rhythm. The circadian rhythm of conidiation always <b>entrains</b> <b>to</b> a light-dark cycle, damps out in constant light, and has a temperature-compensated period length. The noncircadian rhythm of hyphal branching, expressed by the same strain under different environmental conditions, does not <b>entrain</b> <b>to</b> a light-dark cycle, persists in constant light, and its period length is temperature-dependent. These results suggest that the two rhythms have different underlying mechanisms and demonstrate that the differences in the rhythms previously observed in different strains (patch, band, and clock) are not due to genetic differences between these strains but rather are inherent properties of the rhythms themselves...|$|R
2500|$|Mixing {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in the limitation of primary production by nutrients. [...] Inorganic nutrients, such as nitrate, phosphate and silicic acid are necessary for phytoplankton to synthesise their cells and cellular machinery. [...] Because of gravitational sinking of particulate material (such as plankton, dead or fecal material), nutrients are constantly lost from the photic zone, and are only replenished by mixing or upwelling of deeper water. [...] This is exacerbated where summertime solar heating and reduced winds increases vertical stratification and leads to a strong thermocline, since this makes it more difficult for wind mixing <b>to</b> <b>entrain</b> deeper water. [...] Consequently, between mixing events, primary production (and the resulting processes that leads to sinking particulate material) constantly acts to consume nutrients in the mixed layer, and in many regions this leads to nutrient exhaustion and decreased mixed layer production in the summer (even in the presence of abundant light). [...] However, as long as the photic zone is deep enough, primary production may continue below the mixed layer where light-limited growth rates mean that nutrients are often more abundant.|$|E

40|$|Here {{we present}} two {{experiments}} investigating the implicit orienting of attention over time by entrainment to an auditory rhythmic stimulus. In the first experiment, participants {{carried out a}} detection and discrimination tasks with auditory and visual targets while listening to an isochronous, auditory sequence, which acted as the entraining stimulus. For the second experiment, we used musical extracts as entraining stimulus, and tested the resulting strength of entrainment with a visual discrimination task. Both experiments used reaction times as a dependent variable. By manipulating the appearance of targets across four selected metrical positions of the auditory entraining stimulus we were able <b>to</b> observe how <b>entraining</b> <b>to</b> a rhythm modulates behavioural responses. That our results were independent of modality gives a new insight into cross-modal interactions between auditory and visual modalities {{in the context of}} dynamic attending to auditory temporal structure...|$|R
40|$|A bioaquatic air {{pollution}} control system for controlling both water and atmospheric pollution is disclosed. The pollution control system includes an exhaust for directing polluted gases out of a furnace and a fluid circulating system which circulates fluid, such as waste water, from a source, past the furnace where the fluid flow entrains the pollutants from the furnace. The combined fluid and pollutants are then directed through a rock/plant/microbial filtering system. A suction pump pumps the treated waste water from the filter system past the exhaust <b>to</b> again <b>entrain</b> more pollutants from the furnace where they are combined with the fluid (waste water) and directed to the filter system...|$|R
40|$|A {{quarter of}} the world’s {{population}} is subjected to a 1 hr time change twice a year (daylight saving time, DST). This reflects a change in social clocks, not environmental ones (e. g., dawn). The impact of DST is poorly understood. Circadian clocks use daylight <b>to</b> synchronize (<b>entrain)</b> <b>to</b> the organism’s environment. Entrainment is so exact that humans adjust to the east-west progression of dawn within a given time zone. In a large survey (n = 55, 000), we show that the timing of sleep on free days follows the seasonal progression of dawn under standard time, but not under DST. In a second study, we analyzed the timing of sleep and activity for 8 weeks around each DST transition in 50 subjects who were chronotyped (analyzed for their individual phase of entrainment). Both parameters readily adjust to the release from DST in autumn but the timing of activity does not adjust to the DST imposition in spring, especially in late chronotypes. Our data indicate that the human circadian system does not adjust to DST and that its seasonal adaptation to the changing photoperiods is disrupted {{by the introduction of}} summer time. This disruption may extend to other aspects of seasonal biology in humans. ...|$|R

40|$|Type 1 and Type 0 {{resetting}} describe two {{qualitatively different}} response-types of a circadian rhythm to a zeitgeber stimulus. Circadian rhythms are circa 24 -h oscillations in, e. g., sleep-wake behavior, secretion of certain hormones, gene expression and {{a multitude of}} other processes; zeitgebers are those signals from the environment which organisms can use <b>to</b> synchronize (<b>entrain)</b> their biological clock to the 24 -h day. When circadian rhythms “run free” in constant conditions, their period often deviates from 24 h.

40|$|Two general {{research}} questions were investigated {{in the present}} thesis. First, are there cellular changes in protein expression that are uniquely associated with photic entrainment? Second, which subset of retinal afferents {{is necessary for the}} transmission of photic information to the SCN? The experiments aimed at answering the first question revealed a unique pattern of Fos protein immunoreactivity in the SCN shell in response <b>to</b> <b>entraining</b> light. Specifically, light suppressed Fos protein expression in the shell region whilst inducing it in the core of rats receiving light at dawn or dusk. This complex pattern of Fos expression was also present in animals treated neonatally with monosodium glutamate (MSG), an animal model of retinal degeneration that spares photic entrainment. Further, the expression of the protein product of the clock gene Per 2 was found to be rhythmic within the SCN core and shell and unaffected by entraining light. Finally, behavioral arrhythmicity produced by constant bright light exposure was found to be associated with a complete disruption of the cellular rhythm of Per 2 and Fos expression in the SCN. The experiments attempting to provide answers to the second question revealed that the retinal projection to the SCN is heterogeneous and that none of the retinal fiber phenotypes examined (fibers bearing the p 75 neurotrophin receptor or melanopsin) is necessary to mediate photic entrainment. In conclusion, photic entrainment is a unique event characterized by cellular changes in protein expression that differ from those induced by discrete light-induced phase shifts. Further, retinal ganglion cells of all the different phenotypes appear to contribute to the transmission of the photic input to the circadian clock in a generally redundant manner...|$|R

40|$|Human beings exhibit wide {{variation}} in their timing of daily behavior. We {{and others have}} suggested previously that such differences might arise because of alterations in the period length of the endogenous human circadian oscillator. Using dermal fibroblast cells from skin biopsies of 28 subjects of early and late chronotype (11 "larks" and 17 "owls"), we have studied the circadian period lengths of these two groups, {{as well as their}} ability <b>to</b> phase-shift and <b>entrain</b> <b>to</b> environmental and chemical signals. We find not only period length differences between the two classes, but also significant changes in the amplitude and phase-shifting properties of the circadian oscillator among individuals with identical "normal" period lengths. Mathematical modeling shows that these alterations could also account for the extreme behavioral phenotypes of these subjects. We conclude that human chronotype may be influenced not only by the period length of the circadian oscillator, but also by cellular components that affect its amplitude and phase. In many instances, these changes can be studied at the molecular level in primary dermal cells...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to exogenous rhythms {{of light and}} temperature, most organisms exhibit endogenous circadian rhythms (i. e. cycles of behavior and gene expression with a periodicity of approximately 24 h). One of the defining characteristics of the circadian clock is its ability <b>to</b> synchronize (<b>entrain)</b> <b>to</b> an environmental rhythm. Entrainment {{is arguably the most}} salient feature of the clock in evolutionary terms. Previous quantitative trait studies of circadian characteristics in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) considered leaf movement under constant (free-running) conditions. This study, however, addressed the important circadian parameter of phase, which reflects the entrained relationship between the clock and the external cycle. Here it is shown that, when exposed to the same photoperiod, Arabidopsis accessions differ dramatically in phase. Variation in the timing of circadian LUCIFERASE expression was used to map loci affecting the entrained phase of the clock in a recombinant population derived from two geographically distant accessions, Landsberg erecta and Cape Verde Islands. Four quantitative trait loci (QTL) were found with major effects on circadian phase. A QTL on chromosome 5 contained SIGNALING IN RED LIGHT REDUCED 1 and PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR 3, both genes known to affect the circadian clock. Previously unknown polymorphisms were found in both genes, making them candidates for the effect on phase. Fine mapping of two other QTL highlighted genomic regions not previously identified in any circadian screens, indicating their effects are likely due to genes not hitherto considered part of the circadian system. © 2006 American Society of Plant Biologists...|$|R
