5|$|An {{endpoint}} of a pipe is addressable with a tuple (device_address, endpoint_number) as {{specified in}} a <b>TOKEN</b> packet that the host sends when {{it wants to}} start a data transfer session. If {{the direction of the}} data transfer is from the host to the endpoint, an OUT packet (a specialization of a <b>TOKEN</b> packet) having the desired device address and endpoint number is sent by the host. If the direction of the data transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the <b>TOKEN</b> packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the <b>TOKEN</b> packet is an OUT packet), the <b>TOKEN</b> packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts both IN and OUT packets.|$|E

5|$|Arrowmen also {{exchange}} a special handshake as a <b>token</b> of brotherhood, {{along with other}} signs and passwords. A signature acronym, WWW, is often depicted in publications, regalia, etc.|$|E
50|$|Each {{player has}} {{a set of}} <b>tokens</b> that {{represent}} three types of military units: armies, fleets and garrisons. All of a player's <b>tokens</b> have the same colour. Also, the game includes other <b>tokens,</b> such as assassination <b>tokens,</b> rebellion <b>tokens,</b> famine <b>tokens</b> and ducats, the coinage in Machiavelli.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tokens</b> {{originally}} cost $10 for {{a roll of}} 40 <b>tokens</b> (the toll was 25 cents when <b>tokens</b> were introduced), {{but when}} the toll was increased to 35 cents, rolls were 30 <b>tokens</b> for $10. Before invalidating the <b>tokens,</b> the NJHA gave several months' warning and gave motorists the opportunity to redeem <b>tokens.</b> <b>Tokens</b> were originally brass, but were changed to a bimetallic composition with an outer silver-colored ring and a brass core. There were also larger bus <b>tokens</b> that existed in each composition, primarily {{for the use of}} Atlantic City-bound buses. These were sold in rolls of 20 for $20.|$|R
5|$|Civil War <b>tokens</b> {{are divided}} into three types—store cards, {{patriotic}} <b>tokens,</b> and sutler <b>tokens.</b> All three types were utilized as currency, and are differentiated by their designs. The collectible value of the <b>tokens</b> is determined chiefly by their rarity.|$|R

5|$|Each passing loop is {{controlled}} by a small signal box, known as a block-post. These house the lever frames that control the points, the <b>token</b> equipment and telephones. The railway has few signals; instead it has stop boards at Pendre, Brynglas, Quarry Siding and Nant Gwernol, and the blockman allows trains to proceed by use of flags. There are colour light signals located at Tywyn Wharf, operated from the Control Office and disc signals controlled from the ground frame. Abergynolwyn has colour light signals, which are operated from the blockpost. When the block-post is unmanned, {{it is the responsibility}} of the locomotive crew to change the <b>token</b> before proceeding.|$|E
5|$|IN <b>token</b> {{expects a}} {{response}} from a device. The response may be a NAK or STALL response or a DATAx frame. In the latter case, the host issues an ACK handshake if appropriate.|$|E
50|$|Customarily, {{counters}} used in CCGs are small, easily carried objects, such as coins, <b>tokens,</b> Bingo chips, etc. Various game manufacturers sell <b>tokens</b> specifically {{intended for}} use in CCGs, from cheaply made cardboard <b>tokens</b> and glass beads to higher quality metallic <b>tokens.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lexical {{analysis}} mainly segments {{the input}} stream of characters into <b>tokens,</b> simply grouping the characters into pieces and categorizing them. However, the lexing may be significantly more complex; most simply, lexers may omit <b>tokens</b> or insert added <b>tokens.</b> Omitting <b>tokens,</b> notably whitespace and comments, is very common, when {{these are not}} needed by the compiler. Less commonly, added <b>tokens</b> may be inserted. This is done mainly to group <b>tokens</b> into statements, or statements into blocks, to simplify the parser.|$|R

5|$|SPLIT is used {{to perform}} split transactions. Rather than tie up the {{high-bandwidth}} USB bus sending data to a slower USB device, the nearest high-bandwidth capable hub receives a SPLIT <b>token</b> followed by one or two USB packets at high-bandwidth, performs the data transfer at full- or low-bandwidth, and provides the response at high-bandwidth when prompted by a second SPLIT <b>token.</b> It contains a seven-bit hub number, 12bits of control flags, and a five-bit CRC.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two basic}} forms of data packet, DATA0 and DATA1. A data packet must always be preceded by an address <b>token,</b> and is usually {{followed}} by a handshake <b>token</b> from the receiver back to the transmitter. The two packet types provide the 1-bit sequence number required by stop-and-wait ARQ. If a USB host does not receive a response (such as an ACK) for data it has transmitted, it does not know if the data was received or not; the data might have been lost in transit or {{it might have been}} received but the handshake response was lost.|$|E

5|$|Civil War tokens are <b>token</b> coins {{that were}} privately minted and {{distributed}} in the United States between 1861 and 1864. They were used mainly in the Northeast and Midwest.

40|$|Introduction QuickPay is a micro {{payment scheme}} with {{prepayment}} 1, 6. The customer must {{register with the}} broker to obtain an electronic carnet with value <b>tokens</b> before a sale may take place. It is possible to acquire additional value <b>tokens,</b> or to refresh the value <b>tokens</b> at any time. A merchant must also register with the broker to obtain an electronic till with authentication <b>tokens.</b> This will enable the merchant to validate the <b>tokens</b> presented by the customer. Once customer and merchant are registered, a sale may proceed as follows. First the customer presents one or more value <b>tokens</b> to the merchant. The merchant then authenticates himself with the broker and presents the customers value <b>tokens</b> to the broker for validation. The broker decides whether the customers <b>tokens</b> are valid. If the merchant is satisfied that the <b>tokens</b> are valid, goods/services may be delivered. The customer takes delivery but does not receive a receipt.
