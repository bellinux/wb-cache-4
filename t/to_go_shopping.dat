25|$|Shape - The third episode {{features}} Trinny and Susannah {{exploring the}} theme of shape, where they promote wearing clothes suitable to body shape rather than clothing size. Trinny and Susannah get 60 size 16 women to wear an identical size 16 dress in order to discover how many women the dress fits properly. They find that the dress only fits two women, despite all 60 being classed as a size 16. To explore how women see their own bodies, the duo take their pink box in which women can draw their impressions of themselves, finding that they all see their bodies in different shapes. Then 60 of the women from the investigation are introduced to 12 different objects which Trinny and Susannah believe can represent all women's body shapes. The shapes include 'apple', 'hourglass', 'skittle', 'vase', 'cornet', 'lollipop', 'column', 'bell', 'goblet', 'cello', 'pear' and 'brick'. The different objects are displayed around a gallery where twelve women with tightly fitted outfits, to show their figures clearly, stand next to the object which they best represent to demonstrate the general idea. Each model is then given a makeover {{according to the rules}} which Trinny and Susannah have applied to each body shape. The rest of the women are then required <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>shopping</b> to buy themselves clothes, complying with the rules.

Nevertheless, Vulović says she was excited to travel to Denmark because it was her first time visiting the country. The crew had the entire afternoon and the following morning to themselves. Vulović wished to go sightseeing but her colleagues insisted that they go shopping. [...] "Everybody wanted to buy something for his or her family," [...] she recalled.

The band was scheduled to record the album the following day. Pérez found his behavior {{nothing out of the ordinary}} and worked on the song with Vela throughout the night [...] "coming up with drum sounds and programing the pattern for it," [...] finalizing its structure before sunrise. Despite A.B.'s assistance, Pérez was dumbfounded that he was given creative control over the track. He added electric guitar riffs and complemented it with his own musical style.|$|E

500|$|In 1985, Ricky Vela joined Selena y Los Dinos {{as their}} keyboardist. Although Vela was {{attracted}} to the group's drummer, Suzette Quintanilla, he kept his feelings to himself. When he confessed his feelings to Suzette's brother, group manager Abraham Quintanilla, III, he began teasing him about it. After Suzette's September 1993 marriage, Vela wrote [...] "No Me Queda Más" [...] and {{it was given to}} Selena to record for Amor Prohibido. Selena's brother A.B. Quintanilla did not find the song to have any potential; he has said that he later had a change of heart. Although the song was originally intended as a mariachi track, EMI Latin president Jose Behar believed that a mariachi recording would not appeal to the popular market. The group gave it to Argentine arranger Bebu Silvetti to rework into a pop-style track, and Behar asked Silvetti to [...] "sweeten" [...] the song to boost its airplay and chart performance. The result enhanced Selena's pop-radio success. Behar said in a Billboard interview that the song was [...] "internalized" [...] without affecting the originality of its recording. In a 2002 interview, A.B. said that during a recording session he had asked Selena to record the song for a fifth time. The singer replied, [...] "What you got there is what you got" [...] and left <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>shopping.</b> He mused, [...] "Now looking back, she really did a beautiful job when recording the song, she had so much passion. The song became a classic." ...|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{reviewer}} Jeannette Catsoulis praised it {{for avoiding}} the dichotomy of [...] "corporate greed versus environmental well-being", adding {{that instead of}} being an exposé, [...] "Under the gentle, humane investigations of its director, what emerges most strongly is a portrait of exploitation that ought to make us more nauseated than elated over those $20 jeans". Tamsin Blanchard, for the Daily Telegraph, called it a work that will [...] "do for the fast fashion business what Food Inc did for fast food". The Hollywood Reporters Frank Scheck commended it for approaching an issue often [...] "untouched by major news organizations". He said the film was [...] "more despair-inducing than instructive", but was optimistic about its possible impact on the fashion culture, citing the effect that films such as Super Size Me and Fast Food Nation had on the fast food industry. Carson Quiros of Paste also compared it to the former film. David Noh of Film Journal International called it a [...] "vitally important documentary" [...] that contains scenes that [...] "are {{enough to make you}} never want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>shopping</b> again". Gabrielle Wilson of MTV stated it is [...] "hard to swallow but never feels preach-y or like a barrage of depressive factoids" [...] and will empower viewers to change their shopping habits. Casey Jarman said she was disappointed by [...] "the only solution offered: eliminating global capitalism"; however, ultimately, she wrote for Willamette Week that it is a [...] "compelling film, which is, above all else, a badly needed conversation-starter".|$|E

Real unit production costs for most final goods dropped steadily throughout the 19th century and especially from 1873 to 1896. At no previous time had there been an equivalent [...] "harvest of technological advances... so general in their application and so radical in their implications". That is why, notwithstanding the dire predictions of many eminent economists, Britain did not end up paralyzed by strikes and lockouts. Falling prices did not mean falling money wages.
