5|$|Fresno State {{was able}} to run a 7-play, 72-yard drive to begin the fourth quarter that culminated with a 32-yard field goal by Breshears making the score 29-10. Any chance of a Bulldog {{comeback}} was quashed after Carr threw two interceptions returned for touchdowns <b>to</b> <b>Reed</b> and Hayden Greenbauer, the latter of which came with just 1:14 to play. The final score was 43-10, the Mustangs victorious.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 Reed married Elizabeth Greer, the {{daughter}} of Samuel Greer, a County Court judge and former MP for the County of Londonderry {{in the north of}} Ireland. Their first child, a daughter, died in infancy, but three healthy children followed: Charles in 1879, Margaret in 1882 and Talbot in 1886. The connection with Ireland was of great value <b>to</b> <b>Reed,</b> and the family regularly spent annual holidays on the shores of Lough Swilly in County Donegal.|$|E

At the time, 19Mile Road between the freeway Northland Drive was used by the mainline to connect to its pre-existing routing north of Big Rapids <b>to</b> <b>Reed</b> City. The US131 freeway was completed north of 19 Mile Road in 1986, and Bus.

5|$|Cope and Marsh {{used their}} {{personal}} wealth to fund expeditions each summer, then spent the winter publishing their discoveries. Small armies of fossil hunters in mule-drawn wagons or on trains were soon sending literally tons of fossils back east. The paleontological digs lasted fifteen years, from 1877 to 1892. The workers for both Cope and Marsh suffered hardships {{related to the}} weather, as well as sabotage and obstruction by the other scientist's workers. Reed was locked out of the Como train station by Carlin, {{and was forced to}} haul the bones down the bluff and crate the specimens on the train platform in the bitter cold. Cope directed Carlin to set up his own quarry in Como Bluff, while Marsh sent Reed to spy on his former friend. As Reed's Quarry #4 dried up, Marsh ordered Reed to clear out the bone fragments from the other quarries. Reed reported he had destroyed all the remaining bones to keep them away from Cope. Concerned that strangers were encroaching on Reed's quarries, Marsh sent Lakes to Como to assist in excavations, and in June 1879 visited Como himself. Cope likewise toured his own quarries in August. Although Marsh's men continued to open new quarries and discover more fossils, relations between Lakes and Reed soured, with each offering his resignation in August. Marsh attempted to placate the two by sending each to opposite ends of the quarries, but after being forced to abandon one bone quarry in a freezing blizzard, Lakes submitted his resignation and returned to teaching in 1880. The departure of Lakes did not ease tensions among Marsh's men; Lake's replacement, a railroad man named Kennedy, felt {{he did not have to}} report <b>to</b> <b>Reed,</b> and the fighting between the two caused Marsh's other workers to quit. Marsh tried separating Kennedy and Reed, and sent Williston's brother Frank to Como in an effort to keep the peace. Frank Williston ended up leaving Marsh's employ and taking up residence with Carlin. Cope's own digging in Como began faltering, and Carlin's replacements soon quit work altogether.|$|E
5|$|The Bears won {{the coin}} toss and elected to defer. Washington {{recorded}} a 15-play, 80-yard drive {{en route to}} scoring on Alfred Morris' one-yard touchdown run. After the Bears punted, the Redskins scored again with Cousins' fake read option leading to a three-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. Chicago's woes continued when the offense began the next drive on their own seven-yard line, and despite reaching the Washington 49, Jay Cutler was strip-sacked by Trent Murphy, who recovered the fumble. The Redskins failed {{to capitalize on the}} turnover and punted; the following two drives also ended with punts. With 52 seconds left in the first half, the Bears took over at their own 42, and managed to score with 18 seconds left when Cutler threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. Cousins kneeled once to end the half. After the Bears punted on the first drive of the second half, Cousins threw a five-yard touchdown pass <b>to</b> <b>Reed.</b> The Bears responded with Cutler's nine-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller, who managed to escape DeAngelo Hall and made contact with Goldson as he reached the endzone. The score was the Bears' first third quarter touchdown of 2015. Afterwards, Cousins' pass for Pierre Garçon was intercepted by Kyle Fuller, and the Bears took advantage with Forte's seven-yard touchdown run to tie the score. Dustin Hopkins gave the Redskins the 24–21 lead on the first drive of the final quarter with a 47-yard field goal. Five drives later, the Bears attempted a 50-yard field goal with 1:40 left in the game. However, Robbie Gould's kick sailed wide left, and the Redskins ran the ball three times to end the game.|$|E

25|$|The Dolphins had to punt {{early in}} the second quarter {{at the end of their}} next drive, once again forcing their defense to deal with the terror of Kelly, Thomas, and Reed. This time the three players would combine for 67 yards as Thomas rushed twice for eight and caught an 11-yard pass before Kelly's 43-yard {{completion}} <b>to</b> <b>Reed</b> brought up first and goal on the Miami 5-yard line. Thomas ran it across the goal line from there, giving the Bills a 20-3 lead. But on this occasion the Dolphins were ready to respond as Marino completed an 11-yard pass to Mark Duper on third and 5, and then hooked up with him again for a 64-yard touchdown completion that cut the score to 20-10. Not to be outdone, Kelly led the Bills back on a 68-yard scoring drive, starting with a 19-yard pass to Lofton on the first play and a 9-yard run on the next. Later in the drive, he kept it going with a 13-yard pass <b>to</b> <b>Reed</b> on fourth and 3 from the Dolphins 32, and eventually finished it off with a 7-yard touchdown toss to Lofton. With Norwood's extra point, the Bills were up by 17 at 27-10 with five minutes left in the half.|$|E
25|$|This time, the Bills {{could not}} take {{advantage}} of their excellent starting field position and had to punt. Moon's run and shoot offense began to move the ball effectively again. Despite two sacks by Jeff Wright on the drive, Houston reached the Buffalo 14-yard line. Del Greco attempted a field goal to increase the Oilers' lead, but Montgomery fumbled the snap and Talley recovered the ball on the 26-yard line. After two plays, the Bills faced third down and four. With Houston's defense dropping back and expecting a pass, Reich handed the ball off to Davis, who stormed through the line and took off for a 35-yard gain. Then Reich went back to passing the ball, completing a short pass <b>to</b> <b>Reed</b> at the Oilers' 17-yard line on third down and two for the first down. With just 3:08 left in the fourth quarter, Reich threw a 17-yard touchdown pass <b>to</b> <b>Reed,</b> giving Buffalo its first lead of the game 38–35 (after the extra point); for the first time all season, the Houston defense (ninth in fewest points allowed that season) had allowed over 29 points. But Moon led Houston downfield on a 63-yard drive to score the tying 26-yard field goal from Del Greco to send the game into overtime. A key play on the drive was an 18-yard completion to Slaughter on fourth down and four from the Bills' 34-yard line.|$|E
25|$|To {{make the}} {{parchment}} more aesthetically pleasing or {{more suitable for}} the scribes, special treatments were used. According <b>to</b> <b>Reed</b> there were a variety of these treatments. Rubbing pumice powder into the flesh side of parchment {{while it was still}} wet on the frame was used to make it smooth and to modify the surface to enable inks to penetrate more deeply. Powders and pastes of calcium compounds were also used to help remove grease so the ink would not run. To make the parchment smooth and white, thin pastes (starchgrain or staunchgrain) of lime, flour, egg whites and milk were rubbed into the skins.|$|E

25|$|San Francisco {{increased}} their lead to 24-7 {{early in the}} third quarter, driving 46 yards in 10 plays to score with Gary Anderson's 34-yard field goal. But the Vikings responded with Cunningham's 53-yard completion <b>to</b> <b>Reed</b> setting up a 3-yard touchdown reception by Carter, narrowing the gap to 24-14. Replays showed the officials blew the call on Reed's reception because his second toe came down on the end line, but it didn't make much difference because the 49ers {{came back with a}} 75-yard touchdown drive with Kirby rushing for gains of 22 and 14 yards on the first two plays. Young's 15-yard pass to Terrell Owens made the score 31-14.|$|E
25|$|Green's {{decision}} {{paid off}} as the Vikings forced a punt with 2:06 left, and got {{the ball on the}} Giants 49-yard line due to another short Maynard kick. Soon after, they scored on Cunningham's 30-yard touchdown pass <b>to</b> <b>Reed</b> with 1:30 left. Murray then attempted an onside kick, which bounced off Calloway's chest and was recovered by Vikings receiver Chris Walsh on the Minnesota 39. A false start penalty and an incompletion left the Vikings facing second and 15 from the 34, but Cunningham subsequently completed passes to Andrew Glover and Carter for gains of 11 and 24 yards. Following a 12-yard pass interference penalty on defensive back Phillippi Sparks, Robert Smith ran for a 16-yard gain to set up Murray's game-winning 24-yard field goal.|$|E
25|$|NY60 was realigned in {{the early}} 1960s to bypass Fredonia to the east on a newly {{upgraded}} highway leading from Laona <b>to</b> <b>Reed</b> Corners (US20).

25|$|After another Vikings punt, Warner led the Rams 62 {{yards in}} eight plays and capped off the drive with a 2-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Williams, increasing St. Louis' lead to 49–17 with just over eight minutes left in regulation. George, who completed only two of eight passes for −9 yards {{in the second half}} until then, responded with three touchdown passes in the final five minutes of the game. His 42-yard completion to Moss on the ensuing drive set up his 4-yard touchdown pass <b>to</b> <b>Reed.</b> Then Carter recovered an onside kick, and the Vikings scored another touchdown on George's 44-yard pass to Moss. Following a Rams punt, Minnesota drove 85 yards in 16 plays to score on George's 2-yard touchdown toss to Moss, but by then only 35 seconds remained on the clock.|$|E
25|$|The Bills {{crushed the}} Chiefs by jumping to a 24–0 {{lead in the}} third quarter.

Bills kicker Scott Norwood, who had missed five of his last six field goal attempts {{at the end of}} the regular season, made all three field goal attempts, while running back Kenneth Davis scored a touchdown on a 5-yard run. Reed finished with four receptions for 100 yards and two touchdowns, and running back Thurman Thomas recorded 100 rushing yards.

The Rebels took a 14–0 first quarter lead after Manning threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Garland Reed and later scored on a one-yard touchdown run. Alabama scored their first points on a 36-yard Richard Ciemny field goal {{early in the second}} quarter. However, on the kickoff that ensued, Vernon Studdard returned it 101-yards for a touchdown and extended the Ole Miss lead to 20–3 after the conversion failed. Both teams then traded touchdowns to close the first half. Manning connected from 14-yards <b>to</b> <b>Reed</b> for the Rebels and Neb Hayden connected from 15-yards to Jerry Cash for Alabama that made the halftime score 26–9.|$|E
