Using German data, we employ Bayesian vector autoregressive models with sign restrictions on the impulse response functions in order to enquire the role of loan supply and monetary policy shocks for the dynamics of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations.</b> For the three quarters following the Lehman collapse, we find very strong negative loan supply shocks, while monetary policy was essentially neutral. Nevertheless, the historical decomposition shows a cumulated negative impact of loan supply shocks and monetary policy shocks on loans <b>to</b> <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations,</b> due to the lagged effects of past loan supply and monetary policy shocks.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issues of}} corporate control and bank power by analyzing relations between commercial banks and firms in the primary metals industry. We construct three models of corporate control: management control, single bank con-trol, and collective bank control. We test the validity of these models for the primary metals industry by comparing (1) frequencies and distributions of bank-corporate in-terlocks and bank-trust department stockholdings; and (2) relationships between bank interlocks and measures of relative short-term debt and dividend payout rate. Our results support none of the models fully but lend partial support to the collective bank-control model. Two additional approaches {{to the study of}} economic power— the resource dependence perspective and the class cohesion perspective—are then discussed and suggestions made for further research.

30|$|Lastly, Fig.  9 {{provides}} us with a comprehensive picture of the existing financial exposures among the different institutional sectors operating in the euro area {{and the rest of}} the world across the considered financial instruments. The comprehensive analysis of the euro area financial system as a multilayer macro-network allows us to obtain further insights on the challenging problem of estimating the financial interdependencies existing between the banking sector and both the real and the financial sector, enabling the consideration of the relevant indirect exposures via the different financial instruments considered together. Further, this analysis {{provides us}} also with a map of the potential channels through which distress may propagate as a consequence of shocks of different nature. Both the insights on the estimate of financial interdependencies and the map of the potential distress propagation channels could not be obtained with a single layer analysis. In order to make more homogeneous the different layers of the multilayer macro-network of financial exposures, we compute weights as percentages of the total assets of the source institutional sectors. Moreover, for the sake of clarity, we remove links with a weight below 1 %. By focusing on the most relevant links (with a weight above 10 %) connecting the different institutional sectors of the euro area via loans and deposits, debt securities, and equity, we can identify the existence of relevant indirect exposures of the banking system to the financial sector. In particular, as shown in Fig.  9, Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem exhibit a direct exposure amounting to about 16 % of their total financial assets <b>to</b> <b>Non-Financial</b> <b>Corporations,</b> via loans and deposits. In turn, Non-Financial Corporations are exposed for about 10 % of their total financial assets to Non-MMF Investment Fund equity. The chain continues both via equity and debt securities to the Rest of the World arriving i) to Other Financial Institutions via loans and <b>to</b> <b>Non-Financial</b> <b>Corporations</b> via equity, or ii) coming back to Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem via loans and equity, or iii) <b>to</b> <b>Non-Financial</b> <b>Corporations</b> via equity, making restart the chain from the beginning in all three cases. Further, Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem also exhibit a direct exposure amounting to about the 20 % of their total financial assets to Households, via loans and deposits. In turn, Households, other than being exposed to Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem for about 30 % of their total financial assets via loans and deposits, are exposed for about 19 % of their total financial assets to Non-MMF Investment Fund equity. From this point the chain starts to coincide with the previous one. These findings shed light on the existence of indirect exposures of the banking system to the financial sector, and in particular, to Non-MMF Investment Funds, and Other Financial Institutions, that could not be identified if the financial system was not regarded as a multilayer financial network, leading to an underestimation of the exposures of the banking sector to the financial sector and the potential associated risks.|$|E

The FOF accounts consist {{of the balance}} sheets of all institutional sectors in a country, including the foreign sector.

Applying the input–output analysis method to FOF accounts, Y and [...] Y^* matrices (asset–liability matrix of institutional sector-by-institutional sector) are obtained. Furthermore, using a Leontief inverse matrix, four kinds of indices (the power-of-dispersion index and the sensitivity-of-dispersion index) are estimated. Some previous studies attempted to subdivide the corporate sector of the FOF accounts into various industries. For example, Nishiyama (1991) used the balance sheets and income statements of each industry in Japan <b>to</b> subdivide <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations</b> in FOF accounts into 37 industries. In this paper, the power indices of 44 institutional sectors are reported. Kim (2016) used this method to disaggregate the Korean FOF accounts into 115 institutional sectors, including 95 types of inter-industries, combined with the Financial Statement Analysis data. According to these studies, using balance sheets and income statement data for each industry, {{it is possible to}} generate expanded FOF accounts that indicate the financial transactions of each industry. Therefore, if the financial statements of the chaebol are obtained, then {{it will be possible to}} add the chaebol sector to the FOF account. This research aims to find and identify the characteristics and roles of the chaebol in the financial system of Korea. This paper consists of four sections. The first section is the introduction.
