40|$|Two {{experiments}} are conducted in which MBA students make judgments about a company's future performance and management's reputation {{after the company}} reports poor financial results. Information about the CEO's pre-existing reputation is manipulated at three levels (favorable, unfavorable, or none) and the plausibility of management's explanation is manipulated at two levels (plausible or implausible). Generally, {{the results indicate that}} management's explanations influence investors' judgments of the company's future performance and <b>that</b> <b>judgments</b> about management were jointly influenced by both manipulated factors. Specifically, our results indicate that a pre-existing favorable management reputation is an enduring trait that is not damaged even when management offers an implausible explanation. Our results are consistent with Mercer (2004) but inconsistent with other research ([Janoff-Bulman, 1992] and [Meyerson et al., 1996]) suggesting that a good reputation is easily lost. Our results also indicate that offering a plausible explanation improves the reputation of managers with an unfavorable reputation. We also find <b>that</b> <b>judgments</b> about management's intentions for explaining poor performance represent a partial mediator for judgments about management's reputation. Finally, we provide evidence <b>that</b> <b>judgments</b> about the company's future performance and management's reputation are consequential in that they are associated with investors' equity judgments. ...|$|R

25|$|During the Polish September Campaign, Polish armored trains {{took part}} in roughly 90 clashes with the German units. They played a {{significant}} role in several encounters, most notably, no53 made an important contribution to the Polish victory in the Battle of Mokra, and no54 was used very successfully in the defense of Silesia. Armored trains were responsible for destroying or damaging several dozens of armored vehicles, including tanks, shot down or damaged three airplanes, and inflicted numerous infantry casualties. Only two trains (no 11 and 55) were destroyed in direct combat by the German land forces, and only no13 was destroyed by the German air force. Remaining trains were abandoned and destroyed by their own crews when they ran out of munitions and could no longer retreat. The successful role of the armored trains, considered obsolete by both Polish and German strategists, caused the revision of <b>that</b> <b>judgment</b> by both sides.|$|E

This theory faces two important problems: <b>that</b> inconsistent <b>judgments</b> often persist even with high incentives, and that inconsistencies often disappear in within-subject studies. In this paper I argue that these behaviors are due to the existence of “implicit knowledge”, in the sense <b>that</b> our automatic <b>judgments</b> (System 1) incorporate information which is not directly available to our reflective system (System 2).

25|$|In 1996, a {{corporation}} called AGES Group {{filed a lawsuit}} against Raytheon in a federal court in Alabama over a $450 million contract to service C-12 Huron and U-21 military aircraft. The Boston Herald reported that AGES alleged that the security firm Wackenhut Corporation, hired by Raytheon, used video and audio surveillance to spy on a consulting firm hired by AGES to help it prepare its bid. AGES also alleged that stolen confidential pricing documents were turned over to Raytheon. Both Raytheon and AGES had been vying for the contract, which Raytheon had held for decades but AGES won in 1996. On May 12, 1999, Reuters reported that Raytheon would pay $3 million to AGES Group and purchase $13 million worth of AGES aircraft parts to settle the AGES lawsuit. The settlement was exceptional in that the parties agreed <b>that</b> <b>judgment</b> would be entered against Raytheon, legally establishing the validity of AGES' allegations.|$|E

Even though the outcome is selected randomly, the control heuristic would result in the player feeling a degree of control over the outcome.|$|R

Dalrymple contends that [...] "Sentimentality is the expression of emotion without judgment. Perhaps it is worse than that: it is the expression of emotion without an acknowledgement <b>that</b> <b>judgment</b> should enter into how we should react to what we see and hear. It is the manifestation of a desire for the abrogation of an existential condition of human life, namely the need to always and never unendingly to exercise judgment. Sentimentality is therefore childish and reductive of our humanity". In this chapter he also takes issue with a number of assertions made by the philosopher Robert C. Solomon, including that sentimentality does not manipulate emotions, cause false emotions to be shown, or distort perception and interfere with rational thought.|$|E
