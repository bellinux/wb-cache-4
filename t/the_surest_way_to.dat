Hank intervenes and exposes himself, Erik, and Mystique as mutants to the world.

25|$|During {{the early}} 18th century, Guria faced an {{increasing}} {{political and economic}} downfall due to the Ottoman encroachments as well as repeated occasions of civil strife. Attempts by the Gurian princes to enter into alliances with other Georgian rulers and Russia resulted {{in a series of}} Turkish punitive raids. By 1723, the Gurieli had lost Batumi and Chakvi to the Ottomans and the whole coastline of Guria had been garrisoned by the Turks. The Gurian support to the Russians during the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) caused a severe reaction from the Ottoman government. Kobuleti and the surrounding area were detached from Guria and subjected to Islamization, an apostasy being <b>the</b> <b>surest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> escape slavery. The rest of Christian population had to move to safer regions of Georgia. This, combined with extensive slave trade and Turkish inroads, resulted in a virtual depopulation of several areas of Guria towards the late 18th century. The population of Guria was estimated by Güldenstädt at 5,000, and by Reineggs at 6,000 families in the 1770s.|$|E

There are very few differences between the authenticated version and the replica version. <b>The</b> <b>surest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> identify one version from the other is to check the engraving for the 1984 Stanley Cup winning Edmonton Oilers.

2500|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{refers to}} the actual prosecution of traffickers; UNICEF maintains that successful prosecution of child traffickers is <b>the</b> <b>surest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{send a message that}} child trafficking will not be tolerated. Traffickers can be [...] "caught" [...] at any one of the three steps of trafficking: recruitment, movement, and/or exploitation; anti-trafficking laws as well as child labour laws must then be appropriately enforced and having them properly implemented. The development of grassroots surveillance systems has also been suggested by UNICEF which would enable communities to immediately report signs of child trafficking to legal authorities.|$|E

[...] She has said that giving IVF fertility treatment to lesbians would [...] "help destroy our understanding of human identity", and expressed her opinion that opposition to it represents [...] "a fightback to save our civilisation". She said the UK government was brainwashing children by including references to gay people in lessons about censuses and population movement. Philips called it [...] "an abuse of childhood", part of a [...] "ruthless campaign by the gay rights lobby to destroy {{the very concept of}} normal sexual behaviour". She received the 'Bigot of the Year' award from gay equality organisation Stonewall in 2011.|$|E
