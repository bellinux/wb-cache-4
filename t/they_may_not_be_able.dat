5|$|The {{probable}} {{properties of}} further alkali metals beyond unhexpentium {{have not been}} explored yet as of 2015; in fact, it is suspected that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to exist. In periods 8 and above of the periodic table, relativistic and shell-structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate. In addition, the relativistic and shell-structure effects (which stabilise the s-orbitals and destabilise and expand the d-, f-, and g-orbitals of higher shells) have opposite effects, causing even larger difference between relativistic and non-relativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers. Interest in the chemical properties of ununennium and unhexpentium {{stems from the fact}} that both elements are located close to the expected locations of islands of stabilities, centered at elements 122 (306Ubb) and 164 (482Uhq).|$|E
5|$|The overall {{gameplay}} received mixed reviews. Some critics {{believed that}} the gameplay was enjoyable, serviceable and acceptable by modern standards, but most others agreed {{that some of the}} gameplay mechanics, such as the cover system, lacked polish and were flawed. Some critics considered the gameplay generic due to its inclusion of typical shooter elements such as on-rail and turret segments, and stated that such mechanics are unable to help the game differentiate itself from other shooters such as Gears of War, and give the game an identity crisis. Some critics lamented that gameplay occasionally disconnects players from the story, creating tonal dissonance. Many criticized the game for not having a roll mechanic. The artificial intelligence system was criticized for not being strong enough to make the game more gratifying, though some critics thought that the AI system for Adams and Lugo was well-crafted and did not suffer from severe or frequent technical problems, although <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to carry out player's commands. Some critics criticized the game's low replay value, unbalanced difficulty level, and sudden difficulty spike.|$|E

50|$|A few halocarbons, {{including}} acid halides like acetyl chloride, {{are highly}} reactive; these are rarely found outside chemical processing. The widespread uses of halocarbons were often driven by observations {{that most of}} them were more stable than other substances. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> be less affected by acids or alkalis; <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> burn as readily; <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> attacked by bacteria or molds; or <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> affected as much by sun exposure.|$|R
25|$|Inductive {{learning}} {{problem can}} occur as words are oftentimes used in ambiguous {{situations in which}} there are more than one possible referents available. This can lead to confusion for the infants as <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to distinguish which words should be extended to label objects being referenced to. Smith and Yu proposed that {{a way to make a}} distinction in such ambiguous situations is to track the word-referent pairings over multiple scenes. For instance, an infant who hears a word in the presence of object A and object B will be unsure of whether the word is the referent of object A or object B. However, if the infant then hears the label again in the presence of object B and object C, the infant can conclude that object B is the referent of the label because object B consistently pairs with the label across different situations.|$|E
25|$|Data is {{generally}} written to floppy disks in sectors (angular blocks) and tracks (concentric rings {{at a constant}} radius). For example, the HD format of 3½-inch floppy disks uses 512 bytes per sector, 18 sectors per track, 80 tracks per side and two sides, {{for a total of}} 1,474,560 bytes per disk. Some disk controllers can vary these parameters at the user's request, increasing storage on the disk, although <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to be read on machines with other controllers. For example, Microsoft applications were often distributed on 3½-inch 1.68 MB DMF disks formatted with 21 sectors instead of 18; they could still be recognized by a standard controller. On the IBM PC, MSX and most other microcomputer platforms, disks were written using a constant angular velocity (CAV) format, with the disk spinning at a constant speed and the sectors holding the same amount of information on each track regardless of radial location.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} several costs {{associated}} with circular migration. One of these is brain drain, where a migrant who migrates because of skills or education creates a loss of human resources {{in the country of}} origin. These highly skilled workers are in demand in the more developed countries, where in some areas the barriers to immigration have been reduced to allow for both permanent and temporary migration. At the same time, barriers against unskilled workers have been strengthened. The ability to use skills also varies and can constitute a cost to the migrant and the economy, If the migrants had unskilled jobs while working abroad, they will have little experience that will {{contribute to the development of}} their home country upon return. Additionally, even if the worker learned new technical or industrial skills, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to use them if their country of origin does not have the infrastructure or institutional framework to support them. Circular migration also has a social impact on the families of migrant workers. If labor migrants have children, these minors may be temporarily abandoned while their parents are abroad working. This issue is problematic and some authorities have begun to formulate policies to monitor the situation.|$|E

25|$|Heat {{injury is}} a major issue for firefighters as they wear {{insulated}} clothing and cannot shed the heat generated from physical exertion. Early detection of heat issues is critical to stop dehydration and heat stress becoming fatal. Early onset of heat stress affects cognitive function which combined with operating in dangerous environment makes heat stress and dehydration a critical issue to monitor. Firefighter physiological status monitoring is showing promise in alerting EMS and commanders {{to the status of}} their people on the fire ground. Devices such as PASS device alert 10–20 seconds after a firefighter has stopped moving in a structure. Physiological status monitors measure a firefighter's vital sign status, fatigue and exertion levels and transmit this information over their voice radio. This technology allows a degree of early warning to physiological stress. These devices are similar to technology developed for Future Force Warrior and give a measure of exertion and fatigue. They also tell the people outside a building when they have stopped moving or fallen. This allows a supervisor to call in additional engines before the crew get exhausted and also gives an early warning to firefighters before they run out of air, as <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to make voice calls over their radio. Current OSHA tables exist for heat injury and the allowable amount of work in a given environment based on temperature, humidity and solar loading.|$|E
25|$|Gavin {{begins on}} his new job in Wales and his parents and Smithy travel to Wales for Neil's christening. In the next episode Gavin and Stacey, and Nessa and her child Neil, spend the weekend at Pam and Mick's, and after a drunken night, it is {{believed}} that Nessa and Smithy may have once again had sex after waking up in bed together the next morning. Gavin and Stacey begin trying for a baby and Stacey is upset and disappointed when she learns that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to have children. Gavin becomes depressed and preoccupied with this issue, and in an attempt to cheer him up, Pam, Mick and Smithy arrange a surprise trip to Barry beach on a sunny bank holiday. Nessa and Dave also run into trouble after Dave learns about her alleged sexual intercourse with Smithy, but the two decide {{to go ahead with the}} wedding. In the final episode, Stacey discovers she is pregnant after all, and the couple are overjoyed and excited. Smithy shows up at Nessa and Dave's wedding ceremony with Neil, pleading for her not to marry him, and accusing her of not loving Dave. Dave, much to everyone's surprise, agrees with Smithy that Nessa does not love him, and the ceremony is called off. The series ends showing the four (Gavin, Stacey, Nessa and Smithy) on Barry beachfront, with a heavily pregnant Stacey.|$|E
500|$|The euro fell {{against the}} US dollar {{for the two}} trading days {{preceding}} the vote on speculation that a win for the True Finns would hinder the prospects for the Portuguese bailout. Questions were raised whether {{the fall of the}} US dollar to a one-year low could be stemmed. The questions were partially answered on the last trading day before the election, when the dollar rose on concern for a shake-up for European confidence {{as a result of the}} election which caused bearish traders to cover their open positions. The strong showing by the True Finns and the Social Democrats caused EU leaders to worry that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to count on Finland's future support for any such bailout measure. Concerns for the euro grew in the run-up to the election and caused worry after the result. Eurozone stock markets were also upset and could be further upset as the bailout talks, expected to be concluded in mid-May, were affected. While there was no expectation that the bailout wound be derailed, [...] "caution" [...] was said to be the [...] "watchword."

2500|$|UNDOF (the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force) was {{established}} in 1974 to supervise {{the implementation of the}} Agreement on Disengagement and maintain the ceasefire with an area of separation known as the UNDOF Zone. Currently there are more than 1,000 UN peacekeepers there trying to sustain a lasting peace. Details of the UNDOF mission, mandate, map and military positions can be accessed via the following United Nations link. Syria and Israel still contest the ownership of the Heights but have not used overt military force since 1974. The great strategic value of the Heights both militarily and as a source of water means that a deal is uncertain. Members of the UN Disengagement force are usually the only individuals who cross the Israeli-Syrian de facto border (cease fire [...] "Alpha Line"), but since 1988 Israel has allowed Druze pilgrims to cross into Syria to visit the shrine of Abel on Mount Qasioun.

2500|$|One {{group of}} special concern are work migrants, most often poor men, who leave the {{countryside}} to join the wage economy in towns and cities all over China. Some come from areas such as Henan Province where huge numbers of peasants were infected with HIV from scandalous plasma-donor practices in the 1990s. Many male migrants {{are at risk of}} unprotected sex when away from home. And men are also at higher risk of tuberculosis than women in China because the male-to-female ratio of adults with pulmonary tuberculosis is about 2:1 or more, reflecting a real risk excess rather than differential detection or notification. So several factors converge in young male migrant workers to put them at risk of both HIV and tuberculosis, and this convergence has been of great concern. With this [...] "floating" [...] migrant population making up 10% of the total being poorer and having more tuberculosis than average, China has far {{more than its share of}} tuberculosis (disease burden) in the world. This problem is compounded because China's internal work migrants often live and work in circumstances that promote transmission of tuberculosis and impede its diagnosis and treatment. They are usually so poor that the cost of adequate diagnosis and treatment is prohibitively expensive. Indeed, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to get treated at all unless they return to their home village in the poor interior, because subsidized management of tuberculosis (and other social welfare) is only available through facilities in the area where they were registered at birth. Those born in rural zones are not allowed to switch registration to become urban residents. They have been allowed to leave their area (temporarily) or work since 1992 and now number more than 100 million. China's rapid economic growth depends on them, but if they get tuberculosis, they have to return home for treatment.|$|E
