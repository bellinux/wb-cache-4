5|$|The FairTax is a {{national}} tax, but can be administered by <b>the</b> <b>states</b> rather than a federal agency, which may have a bearing on compliance as the states' own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that state. The 0.25% retained by <b>the</b> <b>states</b> amounts to $5 billion <b>the</b> <b>states</b> would have available for enforcement and administration. For example, California should receive over $500 million for enforcement and administration, {{which is more than}} the $327 million budget for the state's sales and excise taxes. Because the federal money paid to <b>the</b> <b>states</b> would be a percentage of the total revenue collected, John Linder claims <b>the</b> <b>states</b> would have an incentive to maximize collections. Proponents believe that states that choose to conform to the federal tax base would have advantages in enforcement, information sharing, and clear interstate revenue allocation rules. A study by the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that, on average, states could more than halve their sales tax rates and that state economies would benefit greatly from adopting a state-level FairTax.|$|E
