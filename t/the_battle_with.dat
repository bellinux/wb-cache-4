5|$|American Patriots {{reacted to}} news of <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>with</b> optimism. Especially after Burgoyne's Indian screen left him, {{small groups of}} local Patriots began to emerge to harass the fringes of British positions. Interestingly, a {{significant}} portion of Stark's force returned home and did not again become influential in the campaign until appearing at Saratoga on October 13 to complete the encirclement of Burgoyne's army.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin and Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester, anointed and crowned King Henry III, {{the young}} son of John, after John's death. Later, Jocelin {{was present at}} <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>with</b> Eustace the Monk in 1217, which helped to secure Henry's rule. Jocelin {{supported}} Hubert de Burgh's work of ejecting French forces from England and regaining control of royal castles seized by Falkes de Breauté and other barons. In 1218, Jocelin {{was one of the}} itinerant justiciars for southwestern England.|$|E

5|$|Marquis {{was taught}} Indian Sign Language by the Crow. This {{would be a}} great help to him in his {{research}} as the language was common to all the plains tribes. Marquis also had lessons from John Stands in Timber, the Cheyenne tribal historian and grandson of Lame White Man, a Cheyenne chief killed in <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>with</b> Custer. Together with co-author Margot Liberty, Stands in Timber published Cheyenne Memories shortly before he died in 1967.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{lasted about}} two hours and Harrison lost 62 men (37 killed in action and 25 mortally wounded); about 126 were less seriously hurt. The Yellow Jackets {{suffered}} the highest casualties of <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> <b>with</b> 30% of their numbers killed or wounded. The number of Native American casualties is still the subject of debate, but it was certainly {{lower than that of}} the United States forces. Historians estimate that as many as 50 were killed and about 70–80 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|William's {{disposition}} of his forces implies {{that he planned}} to open <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>with</b> archers in the front rank weakening the enemy with arrows, followed by infantry who would engage in close combat. The infantry would create openings in the English lines that could be exploited by a cavalry charge to break through the English forces and pursue the fleeing soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the battle}} was a British victory, there was {{criticism}} of Bridport's rapid withdrawal. British historians have subsequently considered that {{a unique opportunity to}} destroy the French Atlantic fleet had been lost. The invasion at Quiberon ended in disaster a month later, although Bridport remained at sea in the region until September. The French fleet by contrast was trapped in the port of Lorient where food supplies ran out, forcing Villaret to discharge many of his ships' crews. As a result, most ships did not return to Brest until the winter and were consequently unable to threaten British control of the French coastline {{for the remainder of the}} year. Several French captains were court-martialled following <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> <b>with</b> two dismissed from the Navy for disobeying orders.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Americans entered <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>with</b> a {{very good}} picture of where, when, and in what {{strength}} the Japanese would appear. Nimitz knew that the Japanese had negated their numerical advantage by dividing their ships into four separate task groups, all too-widely separated {{to be able to}} support each other. This dispersal resulted in few fast ships being available to escort the Carrier Striking Force, reducing the number of anti-aircraft guns protecting the carriers. Nimitz calculated that the aircraft on his three carriers, plus those on Midway Island, gave the U.S. rough parity with Yamamoto's four carriers, mainly because American carrier air groups were larger than Japanese ones. The Japanese, by contrast, remained mainly unaware of their opponent's true strength and dispositions even after the battle began.|$|E
5|$|As the US X Corps {{was pushing}} towards the reservoir, the Chinese {{formulated}} their strategy, {{based on their}} experiences in the Chinese Civil War. Working from the assumption that only a light UN presence {{would be at the}} reservoir, the Chinese 9th Corps Army was first to destroy the UN garrisons at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni, then push towards Hagaru-ri. Believing the bulk of the US X Corps would move to rescue the destroyed units, the 9th Army would then block and trap the main UN forces on the road between Hagaru-ri and Hungnam. The 9th Army initially committed eight divisions for <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> <b>with</b> most of the forces concentrated at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1877, {{residents}} of Ridgefield have remembered <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>with</b> {{some form of}} anniversary ceremony every twenty-five years. A full day tribute was hosted at former Connecticut Governor Phineas C. Lounsbury's Town Street mansion {{in conjunction with the}} town's bicentennial celebration in 1908. The 150th anniversary affair in 1927 featured the publication of George Lounsbury Rockwell's History of Ridgefield, and the 200th anniversary was held a year early to tie in with America's bicentennial celebration in 1976. The bicentennial and 225th anniversary celebrations included re-enactments of the battle, for which portions of Town Street (now Main Street) were covered with dirt for sake of authenticity.|$|E
5|$|Both sides claimed victory after <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> <b>with</b> the JNA hailing the {{evacuation}} of the garrison as its greatest success. However, they achieved only part of their objectives; the JNA failed to secure the area surrounding the barracks or remove all the weapons and equipment in it, and the planned coordinated advance against Turanj also failed. Croatian forces failed in their primary objective: containing the garrison. Nonetheless, the JNA threat from the Logorište barracks was removed (freeing up forces assigned to the blockade of the barracks) {{and a large number}} of weapons were captured.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel gained another {{important}} {{success in the}} Battle of Rafa in January 1917. In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position was stronger {{and the threat of}} its reinforcement was greater. Once again, the availability of water was a crucial feature of the battle. This time it was Chetwode who decided to call off <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> <b>with</b> Chauvel's concurrence, but once again the troops carried the day. The victories at Magdhaba and Rafah changed Murray's mind about awarding Chauvel a knighthood and in January 1917 Chauvel was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. In July, he was mentioned in despatches for these operations.|$|E

The Allies had about 85,000 soldiers, seventy percent of them Russian, and 318 guns.|$|R

5|$|Cumby {{took charge}} of the {{battered}} Bellerophon, directing her fire into Aigle and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. Bellerophon had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded. Although Aigle was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, Bellerophon survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action. Cooke's body was buried at sea the day after <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>with</b> the other fatal casualties from Bellerophon.|$|E
5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} more than 1,000 Athenians died in <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> <b>with</b> another 2,000 taken prisoner, and that the Thebans fared similarly. Plutarch {{suggests}} that all 300 of the Sacred Band were killed at the battle, having previously been seen as invincible. In the Roman period, the 'Lion of Chaeronea', an enigmatic monument {{on the site of}} the battle, was believed to mark the resting place of the Sacred Band. Modern excavations found the remains of 254 soldiers underneath the monument; it is therefore generally accepted that this was indeed the grave of the Sacred Band, since it is unlikely that every member was killed.|$|E
5|$|Exeter {{had been}} badly damaged in <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>with</b> Admiral Graf Spee, and Dorsetshire escorted {{her back to}} Britain in January 1940, before {{returning}} to South American waters to search for German supply ships. On 11 February, her reconnaissance aircraft spotted the German supply freighter Wakama twelve {{miles off the coast}} of Brazil, which was promptly scuttled by her crew. Dorsetshire arrived on the scene shortly thereafter, picked up ten officers and thirty-five crewmen and sank Wakama to prevent her from being a navigational hazard. The following month, the President of Panama, Augusto Samuel Boyd, sent a formal complaint to the British government protesting against Dorsetshires violation of the Pan-American Security Zone in the Wakama incident.|$|E

5|$|For the Canadian Corps, {{participation}} in the Battle of Mount Sorrel is commemorated with the Hill 62 (Sanctuary Wood) Memorial. The nearby Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62 contains a preserved/simulated section of front line trenches occupied by the British and Canadians between 1916 and 1917. Allied soldiers killed during the battle are buried in the nearby Sanctuary Wood Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, Hooge Crater Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, Maple Copse Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery and Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery. Those killed during <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>with</b> no known resting place are commemorated on the Menin Gate in Ypres, Belgium. The Royal Regiment of Canada conducts a Sorrel Day parade, open to the public, at the Fort York Armoury every year on the second Sunday in June.|$|E
5|$|Having assumed this {{formation}} {{upon the}} giving of a prearranged signal, the Allied ships moved suddenly outwards from this position {{at a second}} signal, rowing into the Persian ships and catching them off guard. Their superior seamanship negated, the Persians came off worst from the encounter with 30 of their ships captured or sunk. During the battle a Greek ship, captained by Antidorus of Lemnos, defected to the Allies. Nightfall then ended <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> <b>with</b> the Allies having fared better than they possibly expected to.|$|E
5|$|Jiyuan then {{travelled}} back to Port Arthur, {{where the}} foreign engineer refused {{to serve the}} captain of the vessel any longer, and left. Captain Fang Peh-Kien was executed for his actions in <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> <b>with</b> command passed to First Lieutenant Huang Tsu-Lien. Of the surviving Chinese warships from the battle, the Jiyuan was the least damaged. As the other surviving ships from the battle arrived in Port Arthur, their guns were dressed in red. Jiyuan was the exception, with no decoration and was docked away from the other vessels.|$|E
