40|$|The {{disposal}} of plastic solid waste (PSW) {{has become a}} major worldwide environmental problem. New sustainable processes have emerged, i. e. either advanced mechanical recycling of PSW as virgin or second grade plastic feedstock, or thermal treatments to recycle the waste as virgin monomer, as synthetic fuel gas, or as heat source (incineration with energy recovery). These processes avoid land filling, where the non-biodegradable plastics remain a lasting environmental burden. Within the <b>thermal</b> treatments, <b>gasification</b> and pyrolysis gain increased interest. Gasification has been widely studied and applied for biomass and coal, with results reported and published in literature. The application to the treatment of PSW is less documented. Gasification is commonly operated at high temperatures (> 600 ℃ to 800 ℃) in an air-lean environment (or oxygen-deficient in some applications) : the air factor is generally between 20 % and 40 % of the amount of air needed for the combustion of the PSW. Gasification produces mostly a gas phase and a solid residue (char and ashes). The use of air introduces N 2 in the product gases, thus considerably reducing the calorific value of the syngas, because of the dilution. The paper will review the existing liter ature data on PSW gasification, both as the re sult of laboratory and pilot-scale research. Processes developed in the past will be illustrated. Recently, the use of a sequential gasification and combustion system (at very high temperatures) has been applied to various plastic-containing wastes, with atmospheric emissions shown to be invariably below the legal limits.

The biomass is the best and potentially expandable renewable energy source in geographic conditions in the Czech Republic. The energy usage of biomass has experienced {{a significant increase in}} recent years, however, even in the big energy power plant. This increase in consumption made mainly from wood biomass a shortage fuel, and it began to raise its price. The consumers of biomass fuel are starting to look for a different type of fuel at this time. Stalk and slightly contaminated biomass are representatives of these non-traditional fuels. Stalks are mostly annual plants grown primarily for subsistence. Waste parts of these plants can be utilized for production of energy. The characteristic temperatures of stalk ash have relatively low values. Sintering of ash in a device is one of the obstacles for energy usage of stalk. Sintering of ash brings a number of operational problems at power facilities. Therefore, the part of a research is dedicated to the melting of ash. The <b>thermal</b> <b>gasification</b> is one of the possibilities how to use biomass efficiently. Gasification can be understood as the thermo-chemical conversion of solid fuel into a different state, in this case the gaseous state. The combustion process is generally more manageable for gaseous fuels. Due to this process ower emissions of undesirable compounds at the output of the combustion device can be achieved. <b>Thermal</b> <b>gasification</b> process takes place under stochiometric access of oxidant.
