Free BPA {{is found in}} high concentration in thermal paper and carbonless copy paper, which {{would be expected to}} be more available for exposure than BPA bound into resin or plastic. [...] Popular uses of thermal paper include receipts, event and cinema tickets, labels, and airline tickets. A Swiss study found that 11 of 13 <b>thermal</b> <b>printing</b> papers contained [...] (BPA). Upon dry finger contact with a thermal paper receipt, roughly [...] BPA (...) was transferred to the forefinger and the middle finger. For wet or greasy fingers approximately [...] more was transferred. Extraction of BPA from the fingers was possible up to [...] after exposure. Further, it has been demonstrated that thermal receipts placed in contact with paper currency in a wallet for 24 hours cause a dramatic increase in the concentration of BPA in paper currency, making paper money a secondary source of exposure. Another study has identified BPA in all of the waste paper samples analysed (newspapers, magazines, office paper, etc.), indicating direct results of contamination through paper recycling. [...] Free BPA can readily be transferred to skin, and residues on hands can be ingested. Bodily intake through dermal absorption (99% of which comes from handling receipts) has been shown for the general population to be 0.219ng/kg bw/day (occupationally exposed persons absorb higher amounts at 16.3ng/kg bw/day) whereas aggregate intake (food/beverage/environment) for adults is estimated at 0.36–0.43 μg/kg bw/day (estimated intake for occupationally exposed adults is 0.043–100 μg/kg bw/day).|$|E

50|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>{{printing}}</b> (or direct <b>thermal</b> <b>printing)</b> is {{a digital}} printing process which produces a printed image by selectively heating coated thermochromic paper, or thermal paper {{as it is}} commonly known, when the paper passes over the thermal print head. The coating turns black in the areas where it is heated, producing an image. Two-colour direct thermal printers can print both black and an additional colour (often red) by applying heat at two different temperatures.|$|E

40|$|The {{subjective}} {{image quality}} of panoramic radiographs shown on a diagnostic computer monitor {{were compared with}} professional direct <b>thermal</b> <b>prints</b> and with common inkjet prints on different paper qualities. Indirect digital panoramic radiographs were obtained from 15 patients. The images were printed with a direct thermal printer in their original format. Afterwards, these were loaded in an imaging software programme (Microsoft Photo Editor) and assessed both on computer monitor and inkjet prints on transparency, glossy, satin and regular paper. Five observers assessed subjective image quality for different regions and anatomical landmarks on a 5 -point rating scale. Data were statistically analysed and inter- and intra-observer performances were calculated. Best image quality was obtained with direct <b>thermal</b> <b>prints,</b> followed in descending order by panoramic images viewed on the monitor, inkjet prints on transparencies, glossy paper, satin paper and finally regular paper. The differences were significant except for monitor images versus direct <b>thermal</b> <b>prints,</b> inkjet-transparencies and inkjet-glossy images and inkjet-satin versus inkjet-glossy images. The subjective image quality of indirect digital panoramic images is different for images shown on the computer monitor and for printed images depending on both the printer and paper type used. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the use of image {{intensification}} in a trauma theatre {{over a period of}} 6 months with particular reference to the acquisition of intraoperative image intensifier <b>thermal</b> <b>prints</b> instead of formal radiographs. The quality of the prints and the savings generated have been assessed. During the study period, 476 patients underwent orthopaedic trauma procedures. The image intensifier was used for intraoperative screening in 280 patients. In 278 of these a <b>thermal</b> <b>print</b> was obtained. This was used, instead of formal check radiographs, to plan further management in 210 patients (75 %). In 68 patients, the printout was insufficient in its coverage of the operated area, and a check radiograph was also obtained. In no case did the clarity of the thermal image hinder accurate interpretation. We believe that thermal images are a useful substitute for formal postoperative radiographs in many trauma cases, and that, with notable exceptions, their use could decrease costs, reduce patient discomfort and radiation dose and spare overloaded radiology services...|$|R
