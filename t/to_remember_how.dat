5|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Elsa befriends series protagonist Emma Swan, Emma and the series' central cast resolving the help Elsa find Anna. The group {{eventually}} discovers that a figure named the Snow Queen (a more faithful {{adaptation of the}} original fairy tale's character) is somehow responsible for Elsa's trapping in her urn, a woman with similar powers to Elsa. They soon discover that the Snow Queen is Elsa's aunt, Ingrid, who was forgotten from Arendelle when Elsa's mother, Gerda, used {{the power of the}} troll king to erase everyones memory of her, not wishing for the world <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> Ingrid accidentally killed their third sister, Helga. Ingrid soon discovered a prophecy that stated she would one day have the love of her sisters again. With Ingrid's sisters dead however, she believed she would be forced to create new sisters. For this, she chose Emma and Elsa. Ingrid had stalked Emma her entire life in preparation for the prophecy to become true, and manipulated events in Arendelle to bring Elsa to her. Being convinced that she could only gain their love when {{she was the only one}} left, she obtained a mirror capable of bringing out the worst in people (the mirror coming directly from The Snow Queen fairy tale). If a piece of the mirror were to get in someones eye, they would see nothing but hatred in the world. Ingrid had planned to use this on everyone in Storybrooke (dubbed the Spell of Shattered Sight), forcing all of its citizens to kill each other while she, Emma, and Elsa remained immune. Ingrid had also used this to her advantage on Anna, forcing Anna to trap Elsa in the urn they originally found Elsa in.|$|E

25|$|Chinese {{characters}} are a logographic form of writing, where {{the form of}} the character is not always directly related to its pronunciation. The {{characters are}} composed of a combination of 8–11 standard strokes, over a hundred common radicals, and hundreds of phonetic components. The characters can be very complex and learning them is a highly neuro-muscular task, meaning that it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> to write the characters without repetitive practice in writing them by hand. Scientific studies have also shown that while reading utilizes diverse areas of the brain, reading Chinese makes unique usage of distinct parts of the frontal and temporal areas of the brain associated with motor memory, areas associated with handwriting.|$|E
25|$|Recall {{memory is}} linked with {{instincts}} and mechanisms in order <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> an event happened {{to learn from}} it or avoid the agitator, connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is very calm and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and listeners get the gist of what the speaker is discussing. On the other hand, if a speaker is shouting and/or using emotionally driven words, listeners tend to remember key phrases {{and the meaning of}} the speech. This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it. People tend to focus their attention on cues that are loud, very soft, or something unusual. This makes the auditory system pick up the differences in regular speaking and meaningful speech, when something significant is spoken in the discussion people home in on the message at that part of the speech but tend to lose {{the other part of the}} discussion. Our brains sense differences in speech and when those differences occur the brain encodes that part of speech into memory and the information can be recalled for future reference.|$|E
500|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In [...] "Return to the Nightosphere", Finn and Jake {{discover}} that they are trapped in the Nightosphere, a hellish dimension ruled by Hunson Abadeer, Marceline's (voiced by Olivia Olson) father, although they cannot seem <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> they arrived. [...] "Daddy's Little Monster" [...] features Finn and Jake discovering that Hunson Abadeer has turned Marceline into a giant demon. The duo manage to save Marceline.|$|E
5000|$|Over the years, {{techniques}} and tests {{have been formed}} to better patients with memory difficulties. Spaced Retrieval {{is one of these}} solutions to help better the patients' minds. Spaced retrieval is used in many different areas of memory from <b>remembering</b> facts <b>to</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> ride a bike <b>to</b> <b>remembering</b> past events from your childhood. [...] Recovery Practice is used to see if an individual is able to recall something immediately after they have seen or studied it. Increasing recovery practice is frequently used as a technique in improving long-term memory, essentially for young children trying to learn and older individuals with memory diseases.|$|R

Campbell developed locking accidentally while pausing in between dance moves when trying <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> to do the Funky Chicken. He developed routines based on his new style using these pauses or [...] "locks".

500|$|Although Swift found Motte {{willing to}} print the work, {{he was not}} willing to print Swift's {{additional}} scene. Swift's lack of control over the publication lead to Swift complaining of [...] "mangled and murdered Pages". This was one of many reasons that Swift turned from Motte as his printer and sought a printer willing to produce his complete works without content removal. On 9 October 1733, Swift wrote: [...] "Now, you may please <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> much I complained of Motts suffering some friend of his (I suppose it was Mr Took a Clergy-man now dead) not onely to blot out some things that he thought might give offence, but to insert a good deal of trash contrary to the Author's manner and Style, and Intention." ...|$|E
500|$|Sweden – On 8 August 2008, Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt {{said that}} the crisis was due to provocations from the South Ossetian side and that Georgian forces were trying to restore the {{constitutional}} order. On 9 August, Bildt compared Russia's reason {{for going to war}} with Georgia to Adolf Hitler's actions, [...] "No state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state. Attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged Europe into war in the past... And we have reason <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> Hitler used this very doctrine little {{more than half a century}} ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central Europe".|$|E

His {{last words}} {{were to his}} family, telling Emma [...] "I am not the least afraid of death– Remember what a good wife you have been to me– Tell all my {{children}} <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> good they have been to me", then while she rested, he repeatedly told Henrietta and Francis [...] "It's almost worth while to be sick to be nursed by you". He had expected {{to be buried in}} St Mary's churchyard at Downe, but at the request of Darwin's colleagues, after public and parliamentary petitioning, William Spottiswoode (President of the Royal Society) arranged for Darwin to be honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey, close to John Herschel and Isaac Newton. The funeral was held on Wednesday 26 April and was attended by thousands of people, including family, friends, scientists, philosophers and dignitaries.|$|E
500|$|In {{taking over}} the role, Cortese felt [...] "conflicted over where Ruby is now versus where she's come from" [...] and {{explained}} that her own portrayal of the character was a [...] "total 180 from [...] last season", being calmer and [...] "more fear-driven"; after a discussion with Kripke on the character's mindset, Cortese saw Ruby as being in a [...] "lonely, desperate" [...] situation. She tried to make Ruby seem [...] "as innocent as possible" [...] to make viewers question her true allegiance, and to [...] "bring more of a humanity" [...] to Ruby than Cassidy had. For example, taking from the third season finale in which Dean is sent to Hell, Cortese portrayed the character as having some guilt over his death, even though Ruby was not responsible for it. The actress also acknowledged that Ruby was likely manipulating Sam when she claimed <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> it felt to be human, but suggested that {{there was also an}} element of truth to her character's words.|$|E
500|$|Vig started doubting {{it could}} be done fully analog once the tapes for the first song recorded, [...] "Miss the Misery", started falling apart, but Grohl {{reassured}} him [...] "no, Butch, I don't want any computer in this house at all." [...] The producer said that during recording he [...] "had to force my brain to fire different synapses" [...] <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> to deal with the analog equipment and the lack of a digital display. One of the habits Vig had to call back was editing using a razor blade—"I {{used to be able to}} do 20 edits in half an hour if need be. It took me about 20 minutes to do the first edit!"—a technique he employed for the first songs recorded. Eventually he gave up and decided to punch in and punch out tapes instead, as the process was time-consuming and a more editable tape sent to Vig from Smart Studios was mostly ruined by one of Grohl's daughters. While many recordings had inserts and some parts rerecorded, the only song that had to be redone from scratch was [...] "I Should Have Known", as Grohl felt Vig was [...] "trying to make this into a radio single" [...] when the singer wanted it [...] "to sound really raw and primal".|$|E

500|$|Davies {{created the}} {{expectation}} of Rose's return in the fourth series by mentioning her in dialogue and featuring Piper in cameo appearances in [...] "Partners in Crime", [...] "The Poison Sky", and [...] "Midnight". Speaking on how Rose's character had changed between her appearances, Davies described the fourth series Rose as [...] "tougher, more independent, and [...] might, at times, seem a little harder". Piper stated she rewatched her earlier episodes <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> the character spoke and acted as {{she felt she had}} [...] "been playing posh birds" [...] since she left the programme and by contrast [...] "Rose {{is a bit of a}} chav". Rose is re-united with the Doctor near the climax of [...] "The Stolen Earth". Director Graeme Harper insisted that the scene appear [...] "mystical" [...] because the characters' reunion was [...] "the most magical moment" [...] in the entire episode and Ernie Vincze, the Director of Photography for the show, compared the scene's feeling to the 1980s science-fiction film Blade Runner. Davies characterised the reunion between Rose and the Doctor as [...] "the biggest romance [...] has ever seen" [...] and joked that seminal films such as Gone with the Wind should have ended with a Dalek shooting the male lead. He had difficulty splitting up the characters for a second time for the necessity of the plot. He felt that [...] "Rose has to be stupid to fall in love with Doctor #2" [...] because [...] "she's doing what the plot demands, not what she'd demand". At one stage he considered giving an explanation that Rose's dimension hopping and the Dalek's meddling with reality had contaminated her with [...] "voidstuff" [...] and that she would die if she stayed in her original universe. In the final episode it is enough for her to stay that the human Doctor needs her and is able to reciprocate her love. Porter felt that the climax of [...] "Journey's End" [...] indicated that [...] "Rose's role as a sidekick has been completed" [...] as she has a second Doctor to humanise, one who she can be equals with.|$|E

Rodríguez did not return to Chile until 1987, more than 15 years after she left. Commenting on Chile after the coup, she said, [...] "to this day Chileans are suffering from collective amnesia.

2500|$|However, Carol's {{policy was}} doomed by the {{reluctance}} of France and Britain to fight wars with the totalitarian powers of Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union.

2500|$|While {{some claim}} that phone text {{messaging}} {{is the primary}} cause of character amnesia, the phenomenon, at least in Japan, appears to originate with widespread use of word processors.

A 1993 survey of members of the Information Processing Society of Japan found that habitual word processor users reported declining ability to write characters by hand.
