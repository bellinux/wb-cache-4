David A. Cortman, counsel for Good News Community Church, said the Court's ruling was an [...] "important victory for all <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>guys</b> who have ever found their speech silenced by the strong arm of government". Likewise, Nina Totenberg reported that one {{consequence of the}} Court's decision is that [...] "the government has much less power to regulate how other people speak."

Some analysts also claimed the majority's opinion left open unanswered questions within the Court's First Amendment jurisprudence. Lyle Denniston, for example, suggested that after the Court issued its decisions in Reed and Walker v.

50|$|For Canadian Wrestling promotions, {{the effect}} was lasting. The Canadian wrestling scene was {{struggling}} at the time, with attendance low. As critics had feared it would, the union between Tunney and McMahon crushed many other wrestling promotions in Canada. Soon, wrestling promotions across Canada fell on hard times as Tunney helped McMahon take over their territories. All-Star Wrestling in Vancouver closed down. The AWA stopped performing in Manitoba. Stu Hart's Stampede promotion began eroding until he too was forced to sell to McMahon (and later starting up again for a few years). Grand Prix, out of Montreal, fought Tunney, but also eventually succumbed. Dave McKigney's Big Time Wrestling couldn't {{make a go of}} it due to Tunney's pressuring of Ontario's Boxing & Wrestling Commission to make insurance too expensive for <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>guys.</b> New territories, such as Newfoundland were opened up by Lyons and Zarlenga, but could not compete with a WWF machine, consistently setting new attendance records.|$|E

Scott Tobis of ArtsBeat stated [...] "For as much as Fargo the TV show gets some distance from the Coens, Mr. Hawley seems determined to pay homage to the film with more than just callbacks. ... Like the first season, and Fargo the movie, <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>guys</b> stand to be crushed in the fight. For the Solversons, that means an investigation that puts Lou and Hank at risk while Lou’s wife, Betsy (Cristin Milioti), is weakened by cancer treatments. For the Blomquists, that means the extra misfortune of a hit-and-run cover-up on a person of great interest for all parties — the cops, the Gerhardts and the Kansas City mob." ...|$|E

In the 1970s he was politically active on the revolutionary left, together with other writers, such as Harold Conti and Roberto Santoro, who were imprisoned by the criminal dictatorship of Videla, {{and to this day}} are still disappeared. His novel De Dioses, hombrecitos y policías was written between scary moments and escapes, in clandestine houses at unthinkable hours. This novel was awarded the Casa de Las Américas Prize by an international jury and published in Mexico (later it was translated as The Gods, <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Guys</b> and the Police, translated by Toby Talbot and published in New York to excellent reviews).

While {{directing}} Despicable Me (2010), Renaud, along with his directing partner Pierre Coffin, began to develop Gru's famous henchmen, the Minions. Initially, there were discussions about making the creatures robots. Then Renaud hit upon {{the notion that they}} could be mole people and slapped goggles on them. [...] "I did a very rough, ugly, little sketch combining some elements into a mole person and sent it to Pierre, who then discussed it with Eric Guillon, who was the art director and final designer of the Minions, and they took some of those ideas and together we came up with what the Minions look like". The more the filmmakers worked on <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>guys,</b> the more yellow and more cylindrical they became. [...] "Eric continued to refine the idea and made Minions closer to children. He made them funnier and simpler and a brighter color". Among the inspirations for the Minions were the Oompa-Loompas from Willy Wonka and the Jawas from Star Wars, as well as silent screen stars Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, and Warner Bros. cartoon characters.|$|E
