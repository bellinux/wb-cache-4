Strength of biomaterials (bioceramics) is an important mechanical property because they are brittle. In brittle materials like bioceramics, cracks easily propagate when the material is subject to <b>tensile</b> <b>loading,</b> [...] unlike compressive loading. A number of methods are available for determining the tensile strength {{of materials}}, such as the bending flexural test, the biaxial flexural strength test and the weibull approach. In bioceramics, flaws influence the reliability and strength of the material during implantation and fabrication. There are a number of ways that flaws can be produced in bioceramics such as thermal sintering and heating. The importance is for bioceramics to have high reliability, [...] rather than high strength.|$|E
2500|$|As {{competition}} in the wind market increases, companies are seeking ways to draw greater efficiency from their designs. One of the predominant ways wind turbines have gained performance is by increasing rotor diameters, and thus blade length. Retrofitting current turbines with larger blades mitigates the need and risks associated with a system-level redesign. By incorporating carbon fiber into parts of existing blade systems, manufacturers may increase {{the length of the}} blades without increasing their overall weight. For instance, the spar cap, a structural element of a turbine blade, commonly experiences high <b>tensile</b> <b>loading,</b> making it an ideal candidate to utilize the enhanced tensile properties of carbon fiber in comparison to glass fiber. Higher stiffness and lower density translates to thinner, lighter blades offering equivalent performance. [...] In a 10-MW turbine—which will become more common in offshore systems by 2021—blade lengths may reach over 100 m and weigh up to 50 metric tons when fabricated out of glass fiber. A switch to carbon fiber in the structural spar of the blade yields weight savings of 20 to 30 percent, or approximately 15 metric tons. [...] The compressive properties of carbon fiber do not differ significantly from those of glass fiber. [...] It is therefore economical to replace glass fiber components under compression with carbon fiber components. [...] Improving performance through weight reductions rather than increasing scale also has advantages in transportation. [...] The size of a wind turbine, its blades and tower, are all limited by the height and width clearances, and turning radius, of the route used to transport the components to the installation site. The scale of these pieces has in some cases forced the adoption of Schnabel trailers.|$|E

50|$|Concrete {{is strong}} in {{compression}} but weak in tension. That is, concrete can withstand {{considerable amount of}} compressive loads but it cannot take much of tensile stresses. When tensile loads are applied, concrete undergoes fracture easily. The reason behind this phenomenon can be explained as follows. The aggregates in concrete are capable of taking compressive stresses so that concrete withstands compressive loading. But during <b>tensile</b> <b>loading</b> cracks are formed which separates the cement particles which hold the aggregates together. This separation of cement particles causes the entire structure to fail as crack propagates. This problem in concrete is resolved {{by the introduction of}} reinforcing components such as metallic bars, ceramic fibres etc. These components act as a skeleton of the entire structure and are capable of holding aggregates under <b>tensile</b> <b>loading.</b> This is known as Reinforcement of Concrete.|$|E

Shear stresses will result elongated dimples, which are parabolic depressions that coalesce in planes of maximum shear stress. The depressions point back to the crack origin, and shear influenced failure will produce depressions that point in opposite directions on opposing fracture surfaces. Combined tension and bending will also produce the elongated dimple morphology, but the directions of the depressions will be in the same direction on both fracture surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|Truncation is {{achieved}} by using a slightly larger [...] {{in the case of}} female threads, or by slightly reducing the diameter of the threaded area of workpiece in the case of male threads, the latter effectively reducing the thread's major diameter.

A 60 percent thread may be appropriate in cases where high <b>tensile</b> <b>loading</b> will not be expected. In both cases, the pitch diameter is not affected.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{stress crack}} {{resistance}} of some geosynthetics, such as high density polyethylene geomembranes which are made from semi-crystalline polymers, must be properly evaluated to justify their long term performance. The newly adopted ASTM D 5397 notched constant <b>tensile</b> <b>load</b> test {{can be used to}} make a proper assessment of {{stress crack resistance}}. From the results of a notched constant <b>tensile</b> <b>load</b> test, a mini-mum time to reach the beginning of the brittle portion of the response curve can be es-tablished. Unfortunately, the test takes too long to generate the required data (on the order of weeks or months) for it to be considered as a quality control or conformance test. This paper presents a single point version of the notched constant <b>tensile</b> <b>load</b> test, called the single point-notched constant <b>tensile</b> <b>load</b> test. If the appropriate stress level, testing temperature and incubation medium are selected a much shorter testing time of approximately 24 hours can be achieved.

50|$|Most of the {{synthesized}} Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures {{in different}} geometric configurations such as nanowires, nanorods, nanobelts and nanosheets are {{usually in the}} wurtzite crystal structure. However, it was found from density functional theory calculations that for ultra-thin films of ZnO, the graphite-like structure was energetically more favourable {{as compared to the}} wurtzite structure. The stability of this phase transformation of wurtzite lattice to graphite-like structure of the ZnO film is only limited to the thickness of about several Zn-O layers and was subsequently verified by experiment. Similar phase transition was also observed in ZnO nanowire when it was subjected to uniaxial <b>tensile</b> <b>loading.</b> However, {{with the use of the}} first-principles all electron full-potential method, it was observed that the wurtzite to graphite-like phase transformation for ultra-thin ZnO films will not occur in the presence of a significant amount of oxygen vacancies (Vo) at the Zn-terminated (0001) surface of the thin film. The absence of the structural phase transformation was explained in terms of the Coulomb attraction at the surfaces. The graphitic ZnO thin films are structurally similar to the multilayer of graphite and are expected to have interesting mechanical and electronic properties for potential nanoscale applications. In addition, density functional theory calculations and experimental observations also indicate that the concentration of the Vo is the highest near the surfaces as compared to the inner parts of the nanostructures. This is due to the lower Vo defect formation energies in the interior of the nanostructures as compared to their surfaces.|$|E
