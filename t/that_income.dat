5|$|On {{his return}} to England, Coutances was given custody of the abbeys of Wilton and Ramsey, which were being held by King Henry pending the {{election}} of new abbots. He thus acquired the right to collect the abbeys' revenues {{in the name of}} the king, who had the regalian rights to <b>that</b> <b>income.</b> In 1180 Henry sent Coutances to France on another diplomatic mission. In February 1182 Coutances witnessed King Henry II's will, made before the king travelled to Normandy.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn and}} the {{surrounding}} Manor Farm property were purchased in 1986 by the John Wiltshier Group, a builder/property developer which aimed to restore the barn {{to serve as a}} showcase for the company. The farm underwent major changes, with several of the more dilapidated buildings demolished and a new L-shaped office building constructed facing the barn. Planning permission was granted on the basis <b>that</b> <b>income</b> from the new offices was supposed to pay for ongoing repairs to the barn, following an initial renovation carried out in 1989. However, in 2006, the company went into receivership. The other buildings were individually sold to new owners but the receiver's attempts to sell the barn separately fell through.|$|E
50|$|Some economists argue <b>that</b> <b>incomes</b> {{policies}} are less expensive (more efficient) than recessions {{as a way}} of fighting inflation, at least for mild inflation. Others argue that controls and mild recessions can be complementary solutions for relatively mild inflation.|$|R
60|$|We now pass, from {{taxes on}} the {{separate}} kinds of income, to a tax attempted to be assessed fairly upon all kinds; in other words, an Income-Tax. The discussion of the conditions necessary for making this tax consistent with justice has been anticipated in the last chapter. We shall suppose, therefore, that these conditions are complied with. They are, first, <b>that</b> <b>incomes</b> below a certain amount should be altogether untaxed. This minimum should not be higher than the amount which suffices for the necessaries of the existing population. The second condition is, <b>that</b> <b>incomes</b> above the limit should be taxed only {{in proportion to the}} surplus by which they exceed the limit. Thirdly, that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax; or, if this be found impracticable, <b>that</b> life-incomes and <b>incomes</b> from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes.|$|R
25|$|Economist Tyler Cowen {{has argued}} <b>that</b> though <b>income</b> {{inequality}} has increased within nations, globally it has fallen {{over the last}} 20 years.

25|$|Rudi Dornbusch (1998) {{and others}} say <b>that</b> <b>income</b> rises can change the ratio of demand for goods and {{services}} (tradable and non-tradable sectors). This is because services tend to be superior goods, which are consumed proportionately more heavily at higher incomes.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop in two steps an {{argument}} which shows <b>that</b> superstar <b>incomes</b> exceed their marginal contribution to welfare. Firstly, we argue <b>that</b> superstar <b>incomes</b> can only exist if two conditions are met: There should indeed be differences in talent; but also superstars {{must be able}} to exploit monopolistic power due to their number-one position. Secondly, we introduce an elementary probabilistic model that shows that the existence of such monopolistic power explains the stylized facts concerning superstars, while the presumption <b>that</b> high <b>incomes</b> are completely generated by differences in talent, is rejected by this model. ...|$|R
25|$|Overall, {{according}} to Timothy Noah, correcting for demographic factors (today's population {{is older than}} it was 33 years ago, and divorce and single parenthood have made households smaller), you find <b>that</b> <b>income</b> inequality, though less extreme than shown by the standard measure, is also growing faster than shown by the standard measure.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} begins {{from the}} observation that in equilibrium, total income must equal total output.
