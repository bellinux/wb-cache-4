5|$|By {{the time}} Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on Friday 8November, the divisional surgeon had {{pronounced}} Sandra Rivett dead and forensic officers and photographers {{had been called}} to the property. Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, {{there was no sign}} of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom. The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> two cups and saucers lay in a pool of blood. Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at the bottom of the stairs was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.|$|E

50|$|In contrast, infill at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope has a {{stabilising}} {{effect on}} a translational or deep rotational landslide, in which the landslide surface at the top submerges and describes a sub-vertical surface that re-emerges in <b>the</b> area at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope. <b>The</b> process <b>of</b> infill at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope may include construction of berms, gravitational structures such as gabions, or reinforced ground (i.e., concrete blocks).|$|R

25|$|Due to its {{enclosed}} sub-surface platforms, New Street {{was designated}} as an underground station {{by the fire}} service. In the 1990s a number of changes {{had to be made}} to the station in order to comply with stricter fire regulations, introduced for underground stations {{as a result of the}} 1987 King's Cross fire. In 1993, a new enclosed footbridge was opened at the Wolverhampton end of the station, with access to the platforms separate from the main building: this was built primarily as a fire exit, but the new exit from the station into Navigation Street was opened to the public. All wooden fittings were removed from the platforms, and new fire doors were also installed at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and elevators on the platforms.|$|E
