It was founded by session violinist Ralph Elman, and was previously <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> of the Acid Jazz Records label. In 2013, producer Guy Katsav took over management of <b>the</b> <b>premises,</b> renaming them Denmark Street Studios.|$|E
5|$|Thavie's Inn was {{the second}} oldest Inn of Chancery, and was founded around 1349. It was sold in 1769. Lawyers from Thavie's Inn {{were the first to}} occupy <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> which became Inner Temple in the 1320s.|$|E
5|$|The Minister for Environment, Faisal Saleh Hayat, {{stated that}} he had {{requested}} security for the building, but authorities had failed to provide it. Contrary to claims made earlier, Hayat said the ministry was never ordered to vacate <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> before Pakistan Rangers deployed.|$|E
5000|$|Circular {{reasoning}} {{differs from}} tautologies in that circular reasoning restates <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> as <b>the</b> conclusion, instead of deriving the conclusion from <b>the</b> <b>premise.</b> (This is often conflated with begging the question, in which <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> relies on <b>the</b> {{assumption of the}} conclusion). A tautology simply states the same thing twice.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} were affected by inability to reach their premises even where <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> themselves were largely unaffected by the blast. Criticism was expressed by local citizens and the local MP that originally the depot had been constructed away from other buildings, but that developmental pressures had led to both houses and commercial premises being built near the depot.|$|E
5|$|A stable {{was also}} {{constructed}} at <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> {{from the same}} concrete blocks with Marseilles pattern terracotta tiles. In 1960, as the stables were being converted to a garage, the roof tiles were replaced with a concrete tiles. Three timber doors to the former stable, tack and carriage rooms remain.|$|E
50|$|Even if <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> and {{conclusion}} are all true, {{the conclusion}} {{is not a}} necessary consequence of <b>the</b> <b>premise.</b> This sort of non sequitur is also called affirming the consequent.|$|R

5|$|After {{the sale}} the {{building}} was mainly used for storage whilst planning applications to convert it into a hotel were made in 1986, 1993, and 2001, {{with varying degrees of}} success. The coroner's court was the last to vacate <b>the</b> <b>premises,</b> in 1998. In 2001, {{the building was}} placed on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register. By 2004 it was in steep decline, and momentum was building for the fire station's owner, Britannia Hotels, to act.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>premise</b> behind <b>the</b> {{line was}} that each {{one-shot}} represented a {{first issue of}} a comic published in an alternate reality where pulp stories made a direct transition into comics without spawning superhero comics. Each one-shot came with an essay explaining <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> of <b>the</b> label and a detailed behind-the-scenes explanation for the ideas {{that led to the}} creation of each comic. To help maintain <b>the</b> <b>premise,</b> each one-shot had an Apparat label, with the Avatar Press label appearing only on back covers.|$|R
5|$|Bosi had {{previously}} been head chef and won a Michelin star at the Overton Grange restaurant, just outside the town. He had intended to open a restaurant in Warwickshire, but found <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> too expensive and purchased a 25-year lease on the former Oaks property in Ludlow for £40,000. Within a year Hibiscus won its first Michelin star, {{and at the same}} time Overton Grange was downgraded before going into receivership.|$|E
5|$|By June 1906 {{there were}} nearly 200 machine tools under {{construction}} at the factory, and in 1907 around £5,000 {{was spent on}} enlarging <b>the</b> <b>premises,</b> although a year-on-year drop in sales of 36% in 1908 demonstrated that all was not a smooth progression. Dividends had to be suspended for that year but were resumed in 1909.|$|E
5|$|Francesco Rivarola, {{the commandant}} of the police, had his {{office of the}} Deputy Inspector General of Executive Police {{stationed}} within the Castellania since 1814 when Malta was gradually adapting as a British colony. The police office vacated <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> in the 19th century and {{was moved to the}} Palace of the Governor. As published on the Malta Government Gazette, on 21 October 1829, Malta saw the introduction of a jury system in cases related to murder.|$|E
30|$|This {{second result}} of Figures  5 and 6 {{can be seen}} by {{comparing}} the ratio of ingoing and outgoing data for each request type. Here we see the asymmetric algorithm reduces the overall amount of data going from the cloud to <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> (red part of the chart). This can be a major factor when charges associated with data going from the cloud to <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> are more expensive than charges for data going from <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> to <b>the</b> cloud. On average over the request types, asymmetric partitioning reduces the overall amount of data going from the cloud to <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> by a factor of 52 %. As we see in the next experiment, this can play a role in decreasing the total cost of deployment.|$|R

The main problem involved is the determination of <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> variables, <b>the</b> associated number of modalities and the structure of the local models. <b>The</b> <b>premise</b> optimisation is solved by a forward approach and the structure of the local models are further refined using a pruning technique. The application of the overall procedure on a simulation example is reported...|$|R
5|$|Having won two Michelin {{stars at}} the {{restaurant}} Harveys, chef Marco Pierre White felt restricted {{in the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> as he sought to challenge for a third star. He was introduced to Rocco Forte, chairman of Rocco Forte Hotels, by actor Michael Caine. Forte had begun entering into arrangements with Michelin starred chefs, with Nico Ladenis holding stars at Chez Nico within Forte's Grosvenor House Hotel in Mayfair.|$|E
5|$|In 1852 she put {{her ideas}} into practice, {{establishing}} a reformatory school at Bristol in 1852, in Kingswood in <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> of a school which had originally been set by John Wesley.

5|$|In 2009, Pearson {{was one of}} the 25 {{nominees for}} the first class to be {{inducted}} in the NASCAR Hall of Fame. NASCAR named the five people to be inducted in its 2010 class and it stated that he finished between sixth and eighth place. Pearson left <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> ten minutes after the inductees were announced. The snub drew public criticism and some writers predicted that he will be the headliner for the 2011 class.|$|E

5|$|In {{overhauling}} {{the structure}} of <b>the</b> <b>premises,</b> the National Trust restored its medieval character by recreating {{on the ground floor}} the appearance of arcaded stalls opening onto the street, and the sixteenth-century decoration of the upstairs windows, although this caused a dilemma as it required the removal of fine 18th-century windows.|$|E
