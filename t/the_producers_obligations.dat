30|$|There {{are several}} {{directions}} {{for the future}} research. Firstly, this study considers the national trade in the electricity market and the TGC system. Game theory formulation of international TGC trade in {{the internal and external}} markets is interesting. Secondly, other approaches of game theory to analyze the implementation of the TGC system can be considered. For example, modeling the TGC system in the incomplete information mode by Bayesian models is both interesting and challenging. Thirdly, we only consider <b>the</b> <b>producer’s</b> <b>obligation</b> option in <b>the</b> TGC system, but other obligations in the TGC system can also be considered. Finally, no time constraint was considered to validate the certificates. Using the time variables in modeling of the TGC system seems to be useful.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} interaction between the thermal and renewable power plants under TGC system conditions. We proposed three game theory models for TGC system, namely: cooperative, Nash and renewable-producer–Stackelberg models. These models were analyzed to implement the TGC system under <b>the</b> <b>producer’s</b> <b>obligation,</b> assuming fixed prices for the certificates. Through a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, the effect of some main parameters of the model on the thermal and the renewable’s decisions were evaluated. We showed {{that there is a}} reverse relation between price of the electricity and price of the certificates. In addition, price of electricity has a direct relation with the minimum quota. We found that the electricity supply in the cooperative game is at the lowest level, while the price of electricity is at the highest level. In the Stackelberg model, the price of electricity is at the lowest level and the supply of electricity and the production of green electricity are greater than the other models. In the Nash model, the payoff of the thermal power plant is at the maximum level and the payoff of the renewable power plant is at the minimum level.|$|R

Since then, alternative platforms have entered the market such as SCM Environmental (www.scm-enviro.com) and PRN Runner, launched in 2010. These websites allow accredited reprocessors to post details of Packaging Recovery Notes they can issue from the tonnage of waste packaging material they have registered on the National Pakaging Waste Database.

40|$|A {{model of}} {{packaging}} waste management {{is presented to}} explore the policy options available to governments to implement waste regulation in light of <b>the</b> Extended <b>Producer</b> Responsibility (EPR). Our model endogenises the packaging design as an additional determinant for the overall amount of waste jointly with consumers’ sorting effort and producers’ output decisions. The model shows that the policies that yield the first-best allocation may not find public support. Further, if the set of available policy instruments is limited, production and consumption of the good is likely to settle on a sub-optimal level even though the optimal allocation may be achievable. Finally, the model demonstrates that a landfill tax may actually increase landfill waste {{in the presence of}} tradable credits for recycling activities. The results shed light on some shortcomings of existing regulatory schemes such as <b>the</b> <b>Producer</b> Responsibility <b>Obligations</b> (Packaging Waste) Regulations of the UK...|$|R

Findings indicate that the Regulations will lead to a 14 % increase in freight vehicle kilometres attributable to packaging waste. The extent to which greater use of reusable containers could help to reduce packaging waste-related transport activity is also modelled. Details arc given of how businesses are responding to the Regulations and how some companies are adapting their logistics systems to incorporate the recovery and recycling of packaging waste as well as replacing disposal packaging with reusable containers.

50|$|Among {{stars that}} Richardson {{directed}} were: Jeanne Moreau, Orson Welles, Trevor Howard, David Hemmings, Nicol Williamson, Marianne Faithfull, Richard Burton, Anthony Hopkins, Mick Jagger, Katharine Hepburn, Paul Scofield and Judi Dench. His musical composers included Antoine Duhamel, John Addison and Shel Silverstein. His screenwriters were Jean Genet, Christopher Isherwood, Terry Southern, Marguerite Duras, Edward Bond (adapting Vladimir Nabokov) and Edward Albee. Richardson and Osborne eventually fell out during {{production of the}} film Charge of the Light Brigade (1968). The basic issue was Osborne's unwillingness {{to go through the}} rewrite process, more arduous in film {{than it is in the}} theatre. Richardson himself had a different version. In his autobiography (p. 195) he writes that Osborne was angry at being replaced, in a small rôle, by Laurence Harvey to whom <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> had <b>obligations.</b> Osborne took literary revenge by creating a fictionalised and pseudonymous Richardson - a domineering and arrogant character whom everyone hated - in his play Hotel in Amsterdam.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{determine}} the legal nature of the right to grow and deliver sugar beets. The legal regulations concerning that right in Poland have also been analysed. The right to grow and deliver sugar beets is one of the instruments regulating the sugar market in Poland. The possession of a right is of m ajor significance {{when it comes to the}} profitability of sugar beet production. The right to grow and deliver sugar beets held by a planter generates, on the part of <b>the</b> sugar <b>producer,</b> <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> to contract a certain legally established amount of sugar beets, and to pay the minimum price for the beets supplied under the contract, within the limits set out for the plantation. Therefore it may be assumed that this right is of a pecuniary nature. At the same time, contrary to sugar and milk production quotas, this right can be characterised as of private law type. The legal regulations currently binding in Poland provide expressly that the right to grow and deliver sugar beets is transferable. It may be disposed of w holly or partially, and, as it seems, may also be leased under a leasehold contract...|$|R

The calculus of negligence is a legal approach, {{in the spirit of}} procurement efficiency, that attempts to strike that balance on economic grounds. This is most easily understood in terms of insurance liability. Should a car driver have a duty of care towards until cyclists at night or should the cyclist have a duty of care to properly illuminate his bicycle at night? The costs of bicycle illumination are considerably less than the cost of driving with a duty of care to unlit cyclists.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} retail {{competition in}} a liberalized gas market. Vertically integrated firms run bothwholesale activities (buying gas from <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> under take-or-pay <b>obligations)</b> and retail activities (selling gas to final customers). The market is decentralized and the firms decide which customers to serve, competing then in prices. We show that TOP clauses limit the incentives to face-to-face competition and determine segmentation and monopoly pricing evenwhen entry of new competitors occurs. The development ofwholesale trade, instead, may induce generalized entry and retail competition. This equilibrium outcome is obtained if a compulsory wholesale market is introduced, evenwhen firms are vertically integrated, or under vertical separation of wholesale and retail activities when firms can use only linear bilateral contracts...|$|R

40|$|The {{steering}} of wastes {{into the}} separate collection systems, {{the achievement of}} quantitative and qualitative recycling targets, and <b>the</b> fulfilment of <b>producer</b> responsibility <b>obligations</b> are <b>the</b> three key monitoring objectives {{with respect to the}} recycling of long-lived technical products. Concerning end-of-life vehicles, individual registration of cars by a vehicle registration number (VIN) provides an optimum potential for a thorough monitoring of numbers which is utilised in some parts of Europe already today. The necessary data required for the monitoring of quantitative recycling targets are routinely generated by various actors, but in Germany a framework for their central registration and evaluation will have to be established. Whether or not the quantitative recycling targets are achieved depends largely on the definition of system boundaries which are still subject to debate. Some first proposals are made for a monitoring of <b>the</b> fulfilment of <b>producer</b> responsibility <b>obligations,</b> focussing on indicators for improved design and material closed-loop recycling.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Engineering Doctorate and awarded by Brunel University. The measurement of industries' environmental performance is evolving as society strives towards the ideal of sustainability. Environmental performance indicators within different industries are being developed in order that industry can measure and evaluate performance and report on their level of environmental protection to different stakeholders. Although there are many studies of environmental performance measures, they have {{tended to focus on}} those that apply to manufacturing or 'dirtier' industries. This is mainly because environmental legislation, a major driver of environmental programmes in companies, has targeted these industries. Recent legislation on packaging has focused, for the first time, on environmental impacts that are pertinent to all industry sectors alike. This has given rise to an industry-wide set of environmental performance measures for packaging and packaging waste. This 'producer responsibility' legislation has marked the turning point as more legislation is formulated at the European and national level to holistically tackle the environmental impacts of product life-cycles. Current research has concentrated on the development of performance measures for a service-orientated business that is subject to legislation concerning packaging waste, using ICL (International Computers Limited) plc. as a case study example. Particular attention has been given, in this research, to the identification of EPIs and their integration into an ISO 14 Q 01 certifiable environmental management system for the purposes of demonstrating continuous improvement. A risk assessment methodology is applied to demonstrate the effects of business constraints in the decision-making process regarding environmental programmes. The impacts of <b>the</b> UK <b>Producer</b> Responsibility <b>Obligations</b> (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 on the organisation and the necessary steps that the-company has had to take in order to comply with the legislation have been examined. From this study a compliance methodology has been developed and it has been demonstrated how an organisation can achieve compliance and conserve valuable resources for improving its environmental performance. Finally, a survey has been carried out in order to assess the impacts of the UK Packaging Regulations on the environmental performance of industry. From this study a model has been developed for the application of EPIs to guide policy makers in the formulation of environmental legislation and the implications for future producer responsibility legislation.
