5000|$|It was {{developed}} by Russian born composer Nikolai Obukhov who {{lived and worked in}} France from 1918, and built by Michel Billaudot and Pierre Dauvillier in Paris; they developed a prototype version in 1926 and demonstrated an improved version in 1934. [...] Along with many, including Maurice Martenot, Obhukov was present at a demonstration of the <b>thereminvox</b> by its inventor Lev Termen (Leon Theremin) in 1924. Obukhov composed several pieces for the Croix Sonore, in duet with piano, in ensemble and as solo instrument with orchestras.

5000|$|While {{adapting}} the dielectric device by adding circuitry to generate an audio tone, Theremin {{noticed that the}} pitch changed when his hand moved around. In October 1920 he first demonstrated this to Ioffe who called in other professors and students to hear. Theremin recalled {{trying to find the}} notes for tunes he remembered from when he played the cello, such as the Swan by Saint-Saëns. By November 1920 Theremin had given his first public concert with the instrument, now modified with a horizontal volume antenna replacing the earlier foot-operated volume control. He named it the [...] "etherphone", {{to be known as the}} Терменвокс (Termenvox) in the Soviet Union, as the <b>Thereminvox</b> in Germany, and later as the [...] "theremin" [...] in the United States.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{experimental}} setup is described, {{which will be}} demonstrated at the symposium. Various movement sensors are used in combination with tactile actuators, which provide feedback on the movements made. The aim is to investigate the application of active haptic feedback to improve gestural control of electronic musical instruments. The project is part of ongoing research which aims to improve human-computer interaction at the physical level by applying tactual feedback. The paper describes the background {{and some of the}} theory, rather then presenting results. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce the ideas, set-up and approach. 1.
