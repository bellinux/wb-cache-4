5|$|Along with Bork, {{the other}} most {{contentious}} Supreme Court nomination in United States {{history has been}} the one for Clarence Thomas. When the Thomas hearings began in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about Roe v. Wade, but the nomination appeared headed for success. But when the sexual harassment charges by Anita Hill broke the following month, and the nomination battle dominated public discourse, Kennedy was hamstrung by his past reputation and the ongoing developments in the William Kennedy Smith case. He said almost nothing until {{the third day of}} the Thomas–Hill hearings, and when he did it was criticized by Hill supporters for being <b>too</b> <b>little,</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the club's 4–0 home defeat, United {{returned}} to Open Cup play, where they took on New England Revolution in the MLS qualification semifinals. Hosted at Maryland SoccerPlex in Boyds, the Revolution quickly {{got off to}} a 2–0 lead, thanks to a pair of goals from Revolution midfielder Kheli Dube. Dube scored in 37th and 47th minutes of play. Twenty minutes following Dube's second goal, Virginia-native Alan Koger gave the Revs a 3–0 lead. Shortly thereafter, United's Branko Bošković scored his first two goals of 2011 to trim the lead down to one goal. The late rally, however, proved to be <b>too</b> <b>little,</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> as the Revolution defeated United 3–2. Consequently, {{it was the first time}} since 2002 that United did not qualify into the main tournament propers of the Open Cup.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the company}}, perpetually undercapitalized {{by its own}} admission, faced {{mounting}} financial troubles. On July 10, the company had to post an indemnity bond to avoid the impoundment of President Arthur for a disputed bill owed to Morse Dry Dock for the ship's 1924 refit. The following month, President Arthur was used as collateral for $100,000 loan from a Bronx bank, but it was <b>too</b> <b>little,</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> American Palestine Line was placed in receivership on September 11 by federal judge Thomas D. Thacher of the U.S. District Court after suit was brought by a creditor. Eight days later, President Arthur, docked {{at the foot of}} West 34th Street, experienced a two-alarm fire in her forward cargo hold that brought out both land-based firefighters and the New York City Fire Department fireboat James Duane. In December, the line was accused of fraud in some of its prior financial dealings, charges the company denied. By the time all the legal wrangling was finished, President Arthur was back {{in the hands of the}} USSB, and the furniture and fixtures of the American Palestine offices were sold at public auction by the company's receiver in early March 1926.|$|E

25|$|The Pirates started Game1 strong, scoring six runs in {{the first}} four innings.

25|$|The {{intensification}} of Allied bombing caused the dispersion {{of production and}} prevented an efficient acceleration of Milch's expansion program. The German aviation production reached about 36,000 aircraft for 1944. However, {{by the time this}} was achieved the Luftwaffe lacked the fuel and trained pilots to make this achievement worthwhile. The failure to maximize production immediately after the failures in the Soviet Union and North Africa ensured the Luftwaffes effective defeat in the period of September 1943 – February 1944. Despite the tactical victories won, they failed to achieve a decisive victory. By the time production reached acceptable levels, it was <b>too</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{the nuclear}} power debate continues, {{greenhouse}} gas emissions are not decreasing, they are increasing. Predictions estimate that even with draconian emission reductions within the ten years, the world will still pass 650ppm {{of carbon dioxide and}} a catastrophic 4C average rise in temperature. Public perception is that renewable energies such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal are significantly affecting global warming. All of these sources combined only supplied 1.3% of global energy in 2013 as 8 billion tonnes of coal was burned annually. This <b>too</b> <b>little,</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> may be a mass form of climate change denial, or an idealistic pursuit of green energy.|$|E
25|$|The {{last game}} in August saw League Two Hereford United visit St Andrew's {{in the second}} round of the League Cup. Two first half goals from Garry O'Connor and Gary McSheffrey saw Blues lead at half time, only for Hereford to fight back in the second half to score through Theo Robinson. But it was <b>too</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> from the Herefordshire side as Blues dumped them out of the cup. Blues' {{exploits}} in the League Cup came to an undramatic end as they bowed out to Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. Goals from David Bentley, Matt Derbyshire and Roque Santa Cruz were enough to see off a much weakened Blues team.|$|E

25|$|The Confederacy {{adopted a}} tariff or tax on imports of 15 per cent, and imposed it on all imports from other countries, {{including}} the United States. The tariff mattered little; the Union blockade minimized commercial traffic through the Confederacy's ports, {{and very few}} people paid taxes on goods smuggled from the North. The Confederate government in its entire history collected only $3.5 million in tariff revenue. The lack of adequate financial resources led the Confederacy to finance the war through printing money, which led to high inflation. The Confederacy underwent an economic revolution by centralization and standardization, but it was <b>too</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> as its economy was systematically strangled by blockade and raids.|$|E
25|$|Stopping the hemorrhaging {{that was}} BAD was <b>too</b> <b>little,</b> <b>too</b> <b>late,</b> the {{magazine}} had bled the ABA white {{and left it}} {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy. On top of the BAD affair came the rising cost of the insurance crises of the early 1980s with its skyrocketing rates. This affected every sanctioning body, but given the ABA's greatly weakened state it was life-threatening to it. By 1984 the first indications of the plateauing of the popularity of BMX was the flattening growth in memberships and the falling off of attendance of nationals. Some of this was caused by the growing popularity of BMX Freestyle siphoning potential racers from BMX and the beginnings of the resurgence of skateboarding, both of which would explode in popularity by 1985.|$|E
25|$|Michael Lumb with 89 and Ian Harvey with 74 lifted Yorkshire to 270 all out at Headingley in {{the fourth}} quarter-final of the C Trophy. It {{was a bit of}} an {{implosion}} from 227 for 3, but runs came thick and fast in that period, so Yorkshire wouldn't be too disappointed with losing their wickets. Northamptonshire started well, getting to 163 for 2 after all their top four got starts, but two wickets from England Test bowler Matthew Hoggard started to turn the match. From then on, the Northamptonshire effort just stopped dead, as they lost five wickets for 24 runs to fall to 216 for 9. Steffan Jones and Jason Brown paired up for 21 for the last wicket, but it was <b>too</b> <b>little,</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b>|$|E

Some of the measures were alleged to have encroached on provincial jurisdictions laid out in section 92 of the British North America Act. The courts, including the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, agreed and eventually struck down virtually all of Bennett's reforms. However, some of Bennett's initiatives, such as the Bank of Canada, which he founded in 1934, remain in place to this day, and the Canadian Wheat Board remained in place until 2011 when the government of Stephen Harper abolished it.|$|E

25|$|His time as Viceroy {{was marked}} with {{consistent}} calls for self-government, which Chelmsford agreed to, convincing a preoccupied Foreign Office {{to send the}} Secretary of State for India, Edwin Samuel Montagu, to discuss the potential for reform. Together they oversaw {{the implementation of the}} Montagu-Chelmsford reforms, which gave greater authority to local Indian representative bodies and paved the way for a free India. Trying to tread a fine line between reform and maintaining the British hold over India, Chelmsford passed repressive anti-terrorism laws to widespread opposition from Indian reformists. The laws sparked unrest in the Punjab, culminating in the implementation of martial law in the region and the Amritsar Massacre by General Reginald Dyer on 13 April 1919. Initially supportive of Dyer and slow to respond to the massacre, following a ruling condemning Dyers actions, Chelmsford eventually disciplined Dyer. This was however, seen by Indian Nationalists as <b>too</b> <b>little,</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> and the Indian National Congress boycotted the first regional elections in 1920.

25|$|No {{team had}} ever managed to chase down a T20I score {{of more than}} 200 in England, and it had only been done three times {{anywhere}} in the world. Michael Lumb and Alex Hales got them {{off to a good}} start, reaching 50 runs in just 3.3 overs; however, Lumb was out to the very next ball, bowled by Nathan McCullum. Hales was joined at the wicket by Luke Wright, and the pair put on another 55 runs for the second wicket, before Hales holed out to Franklin at mid-wicket for 39. Morgan was next to go, his 7 runs off 10 balls making him the only England batsman to score at a rate of less than a run a ball, and he was followed in the very next over by Wright. However, Wright's 52 off 34 balls left England needing 63 off the last five overs. An unbeaten 30 from Ravi Bopara, Buttler's quick-fire 17 and a six off the first ball of the final over from Ben Stokes got England to within five runs of the New Zealand total, but {{in the end it was}} <b>too</b> <b>little,</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> and the tourists took a 1–0 lead in the series.|$|E

In the 38th minute however, the agony for the hosts mounted as Joel Sunday scored a scorcher of a goal to give Aizawl a 2–1 lead with 2 away goals, 1 more than Bengaluru FC. After the restart, post the lemon break, the fate of the match was sealed by the Aizawl captain David Lalrinmuana as he scored from a direct free-kick to give the visitors an almost unassailable 3–1 lead (5–2 on aggregate). Bengaluru FC pressed hard in the final half hour and did manage to pull one back through a penalty goal from Indian striker Sunil Chettri.
