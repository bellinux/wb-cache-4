This work aimed at: i) testing the efficiency of contact fungicides (mancozebe, cartap and copper oxichloride) and systemic fungicides (<b>triadimenol,</b> tebuconazole and difenoconazole) for poplar rust control; ii) comparing evaluation methods to discriminate the efficiency among the treatments; iii) relating defoliation and disease data and iv) verify the influence of rust control under growth tree parameters. The experiment was conducted in São Mateus do Sul, PR and arranged in a completely randomized design with 10 treatments (check, <b>triadimenol,</b> mancozebe, tebuconazole, difenoconazole, cartap, copper oxichloride, triadimenol-mancozebe, tebuconazole-mancozebe and <b>triadimenol</b> applied at double the interval of the previous ones) and 11 repetitions. The experimental plots were 10 m wide with 4 planting rows (space between the lines was 2. 5 and between the plants, 0. 50 m), totaling 110 plots with the Latorre clone. The following aspects were evaluated during two consecutive cycles: number of pustules per half leaf; visual percentage of the disease; severity per plot; visual percentage of defoliation, diameter at breast height and plant height {{at the end of the}} experiment. The systemic products (<b>triadimenol,</b> tebuconazole and difenoconazole) applied alone or interpolated with mancozebe were efficient in controlling the disease, reducing both the number of leaf pustules and defoliation, resulting in a significant gain in the final plant volume. Mancozebe applied alone also reduced epidemics and increased tree volume in 42 %. The cupric product made the volume increase in 27 %. The evaluation methods used showed differences among the treatments and there was a correlation between the disease and the damage caused to the culture...|$|E

Treatments included: seed-applied fungicides (<b>triadimenol</b> + mefenoxam + thiram and carboxin + PCNB + mefenoxam), cultivars (Paymaster [PM] 2326 RR and PM 2200 RR), and a nematicide (aldicarb at 0. 83 kg a. i/ha). Plant stands were higher (P = 0. 02) in the presence of aldicarb (77 % emergence) than in its absence (74 % emergence). Hypocotyl disease symptom ratings were lower (P = 0. 0001) following <b>triadimenol</b> + mefenoxam + thiram seed treatment (0. 53) as compared with carboxin + PCNB + mefenoxam (0. 93). Root necrosis was lower (P = 0. 002) following <b>triadimenol</b> + mefenoxam + thiram seed treatment (27 %) as compared with carboxin + PCNB + mefenoxam (34 %). In one field, in both years, aldicarb was associated with more root necrosis (58 %) than in its absence (46 %) (P = 0. 004). At three other sites aldicarb did not affect root necrosis. Population densities of Meloidogyne incognita eggs and juveniles at midseason were greater (P = 0. 005, P = 0. 003, respectively) on PM 2200 RR (less resistant) than on PM 2326 RR (more resistant). Yield was affected by the plant genotype by aldicarb interaction (P = 0. 02) but not by seed treatments. Aldicarb effect on yield was dependent on cultivar, whereas affect of seed treatment on root health was consistent and independent of cultivar and aldicarb.
