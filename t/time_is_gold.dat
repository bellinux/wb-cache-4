50|$|The first European {{to enter}} the region was Thomas Dias, a Portuguese {{employed}} by the Dutch governor of Malacca. He travelled from the east coast to reach the region in 1684 and reported, probably from hearsay, {{that there was a}} palace at Pagaruyung and that visitors had to go through three gates to enter it. The primary local occupations at the <b>time</b> <b>were</b> <b>gold</b> panning and agriculture, he reported.|$|R

5000|$|... "That {{thing about}} <b>time</b> being <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> a big stupidity. <b>Time</b> <b>is</b> life. I am {{interested}} in living it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mindoro [...] - [...] The {{name was}} derived from the Spanish Minas de oro ("gold mine"). At that <b>time</b> there <b>were</b> <b>gold</b> dust and nuggets in the river beside the village, and people used to pan these and sell them to the rich. General Alzate gave the village its present name.|$|R
50|$|Régina {{lies on the}} Approuague River. In former <b>times</b> it <b>was</b> a <b>gold</b> mining centre. The Les Nourages Nature Reserve {{is located}} near the town.|$|R

5000|$|Leeburn (...) {{is located}} along Highway 638. At one <b>time</b> there <b>was</b> a <b>gold</b> mine at Bass Lake, a few {{kilometres}} north of Leeburn. The {{quality of the}} ore found was not sufficient to make the mine profitable.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 Silver and <b>Gold</b> Matilda statuettes <b>were</b> introduced, {{awarded for}} either a single work or {{a body of}} work over <b>time.</b> There <b>were</b> five <b>Gold</b> Awards each year but in 2015 only one was awarded as a result of {{industry}} advice.|$|R
50|$|At one <b>time</b> <b>Golding</b> <b>was</b> {{considered}} {{as a candidate for}} U.S. Senate or Governor of California. She made a run for Barbara Boxer's Senate seat in 1998, but had to drop out due to lagging polling numbers and fundraising difficulties.|$|R
6000|$|And again, further on--"never did I {{see so much}} gold {{whether in}} dust, nuggets, or worked articles. I imagine it must be worth millions, but at that <b>time</b> <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> the last thing with which I wished to trouble myself." ...|$|R
50|$|Bracken was apprenticed to a {{pharmacist}} in Bendigo, later moved around {{to work on}} farms as a shearer and drover, and for a <b>time</b> <b>was</b> a <b>gold</b> fossicker and store keeper. At that time he began writing tales over {{the activities of the}} diggers involved in the goldrush, and about stock men and sheep men.He also established Thomas Bracken and Co with Alexander Bathgate to buy and operate the Evening Herald until it was superseded in 1890 by the liberal Globe.|$|R
50|$|By 1800, Jamestown was {{a bustling}} {{settlement}} of 150 residents {{with its own}} post office, inn and Freemasons' lodge. Around this same <b>time,</b> <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> discovered near Jamestown, and several mines profited until the California Gold Rush frenzy shut down local efforts.|$|R
5000|$|Dentists {{have used}} gold for filling {{cavities}} (before mercury amalgam became available), for crowns, {{and for other}} purposes since ancient <b>times.</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>is</b> malleable, nearly immune to corrosion, and hard enough to form a biting surface {{that can be used}} for years. <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> used before silver became available and has continued to be used for specialized purposes. Dental restorations are often made from a combination of precious metals.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> first {{reported}} to have been discovered at Moonan Brook in 1855, by Richard Ward. Some nuggets were found in 1856 by Captain Moore. Some <b>time</b> later <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> found in quartz deposits by Moore and a Mr. Simpson. Mining in {{what was called the}} Denison Diggings was well under way by 1861.Captain Thunderbolt robbed two miners at Denison Diggings in February 1867.|$|R
50|$|After Spanish {{arrival in}} the 15th century Chilean economy came to revolve around {{autarchy}} estates called fundos and around the army that was engaged in the Arauco War. During early colonial <b>times</b> there <b>were</b> <b>gold</b> exports to Perú from placer deposits which soon depleted. Trade restrictions and monopolies established by the Spanish crown are credited for having held back economic development {{for much of the}} colonial times. As effect of these restrictions the country incorporated very few new crops and animal breeds after initial conquest. Other sectors that were held back by restrictions were the wine and mining industries. The Bourbon reforms in the 18th century eased many monopolies and trade restrictions.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to model}} and {{forecast}} {{the volatility of}} gold price {{with the help of}} other precious metals. The data applied for application part in the article involves three financial <b>time</b> series which <b>are</b> <b>gold,</b> silver and platinum daily spot prices. The volatility is modeled by univariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models including GARCH and EGARCH with different distributions such as normal distribution and student-t distribution. At the same time, comparisons of estimation and forecasting the volatility between GARCH family models have been done...|$|R
50|$|Pál Joensen {{participated in}} the European Short Course Swimming Championships in Istanbul, 2009 in 400 M Freestyle and 1500 M Freestyle. Joensen {{qualified}} for the final in 400 M Freestyle, but he cancelled the final. Joensen swam the final in 1500 M Freestyle and became number 7; his <b>time</b> <b>was</b> 14:38.00. <b>Gold</b> winner in the Men's 1500 M Freestyle on Short Course was Jan Wolfgarten from Germany, who swam with the time 14:20.44, silver winner was Federico Colbertaldo from Italy and bronze winner was Mads Glæsner from Denmark. Glæsner swam with the <b>time</b> 14:26.74, which <b>was</b> new Nordic Record. Joensen sat the Nordic record in the Men's 1500 M Freestyle on Short Course in November 2009, but in Istanbul in December 2009 Glæsner beat Joensen's Nordic Record.|$|R
50|$|After {{a five-year}} lull, in 2002, {{the price of}} gold began to see a rebound. In 2001, Telfer was {{approached}} by mining financier, Frank Giustra. At the <b>time,</b> <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> still trading at a low $300 an ounce level. Together, Telfer and Giustra discussed plans of re-entering the gold market and finding an appropriate investment vehicle to do so. Giustra pinpointed Wheaton River Minerals, which at the <b>time</b> <b>was</b> a shell company with $5 to $10 million and 6 employees.|$|R
50|$|<b>Golding</b> <b>was</b> {{given the}} job of {{completing}} John Brende's translation of Caesar’s Gallic War when Brende died. Sir William Cecil passed the manuscript to Golding for completion sometime between Brende's death in 1560 or 1561 (the exact year he died is not certain) and 1564. At same <b>time</b> <b>Golding</b> <b>was</b> working on the first four books of Ovid’s Metamorphosis, which he finished in December 1564. He completed a translation begun by Philip Sidney from Philippe de Mornay, A Worke concerning the Trewnesse of the Christian Religion (1604).|$|R
50|$|In 2012, {{the album}} was ranked number 359 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 {{greatest}} albums of all <b>time.</b> It <b>was</b> certified <b>gold</b> in July 1972 and platinum in October 1995 by the RIAA. This was the final Elton John album on the Uni label in the US and Canada before MCA consolidated all of its various labels under the MCA brand. This and John's earlier Uni albums were later reissued on MCA Records.|$|R
50|$|Conservative {{groups and}} the {{financial}} classes, on the other hand, believed that such a policy would be disastrous, and they insisted that inflation, once begun, could not be stopped. Railroad bonds, the most important financial instrument of the <b>time,</b> <b>were</b> payable in <b>gold.</b> If fares and freight rates were set in half-price silver dollars, railroads would go bankrupt in weeks, throwing {{hundreds of thousands of}} men out of work and destroying the industrial economy. Only the gold standard, they said, offered stability.|$|R
50|$|In 1848, the Mexican-American War {{concluded}} and Alta California (that {{includes the}} modern U.S. state of California, plus nearby regions) {{became part of}} the United States. At around the same <b>time,</b> <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> discovered in California, leading to an influx of miners into California, both from within the United States, and from other regions, primarily China and Latin America (including Mexico, Peru, and Guatemala). This {{was the beginning of the}} California Gold Rush.|$|R
50|$|Anders Christian Golding (born 12 May 1984) is a Danish skeet shooter. He competed at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics and won {{a silver}} medal in 2012. This was Denmark's first medal at the 2012 Olympics and their first medal in the men's skeet since 1984.

50|$|Metallic {{and gold}} {{compounds}} {{have long been}} used for medicinal purposes. Gold, usually as the metal, {{is perhaps the most}} anciently administered medicine (apparently by shamanic practitioners) and known to Dioscorides. In medieval <b>times,</b> <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> often seen as beneficial for the health, in the belief that something so rare and beautiful could not be anything but healthy. Even some modern esotericists and forms of alternative medicine assign metallic gold a healing power.|$|R
50|$|Like many American {{films of}} the <b>time,</b> Thieves' <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> subject to cuts by city and state film {{censorship}} boards. For example, the Chicago Board of Censors cut, in Reel 2, six scenes of women at bar and women drinking, flashed two scenes of tough dancing by Cheyenne Harry and young woman, Harry shooting a Mexican, Reel 4, four holdup scenes, Reel 5, shooting of Padden, two scenes of Harry shooting.|$|R
50|$|Silver veins were {{discovered}} in the Central City-Idaho Springs district a short <b>time</b> after <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> discovered there in 1859. However, mining the silver veins was delayed {{for the most part}} until smelters were built in the late 1860s. The veins of the district are zoned in a roughly concentric manner, with gold-bearing pyrite veins in the center, and silver-bearing galena veins more common in the outlying areas.|$|R
25|$|Currency had not {{yet been}} invented, so Assyrian merchants used gold for {{wholesale}} trade and silver for retail trade during this <b>time.</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> considered eight <b>times</b> more valuable than silver. But there was one more metal, amutum, which was even more valuable than <b>gold.</b> Amutum <b>is</b> thought to be the newly discovered iron and <b>was</b> forty <b>times</b> more valuable than silver. The most important Anatolian export was copper, and the Assyrian merchants sold tin and clothing to Anatolia.|$|R
5000|$|Because, under Mormon doctrine, John Doyle Lee {{was allowed}} to have {{multiple}} wives, he had to travel much of the time, to attend to his other wives and children. Lee often left to visit his [...] "gold mines." [...] As a consequence, Emma Lee was left to attend both the ferry and her children. When Emma Lee left Lonely Dell after Lee's death, she had several coffee cans of gold. At one <b>time</b> there <b>was</b> a <b>gold</b> map showing {{the location of the}} mine which is now under Lake Powell.|$|R
5000|$|The album reached No. 95 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and {{remained}} on that chart for eight weeks, {{as well as}} reaching No. 72 in the Netherlands and No. 87 in Germany. [...] "All Alone" [...] was released as a single, reaching No. 21 on Billboards Mainstream Rock chart and receiving a nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance at the 1995 Grammy Awards, along with [...] "Speed of Light" [...] at the 1994 Grammys; these being Satrianis fifth and sixth such nominations. <b>Time</b> Machine <b>was</b> certified <b>Gold</b> on October 27, 1994.|$|R
25|$|Californios {{who lived}} in California had finally {{had enough of the}} Mexican {{government}} and seized control of the territory of Alta California in 1846. At the <b>time</b> <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> discovered in 1848, California had about 9,000 former Californios and about 3,000 United States citizens including members of Colonel Jonathan D. Stevenson's 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers and discharged members of the California Battalion and Mormon Battalions. The Pacific Squadron secured San Francisco Bay and the coastal cities of California.|$|R
50|$|The town {{site was}} named after a comet {{that could be seen}} at about the <b>time</b> <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} in the area. By 1895 the town had a population of approximately 500, and by 1897 the townspeople were demanding a post-office. The postmaster general instructed postmasters at Menzies and Googarrie prepare daily mail bags for Comet Vale which were then distributed at one of the stores in town.The Comet Vale Hotel <b>was</b> established some <b>time</b> prior to 1898.The town was gazetted in 1916.|$|R
500|$|During {{periods of}} {{sustained}} economic stability and growth, {{the price of}} platinum tends {{to be as much}} as twice the price of gold, whereas during periods of economic uncertainty, the price of platinum tends to decrease due to reduced industrial demand, falling below the price of <b>gold.</b> <b>Gold</b> prices <b>are</b> more stable in slow economic <b>times,</b> as <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> considered a safe haven. [...] Although <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> used in industrial applications, its demand is not so driven by industrial uses. In the 18th century, platinum's rarity made King Louis XV of France declare it the only metal fit for a king.|$|R
50|$|Transport was {{an ongoing}} {{problem for the}} new settlers. Getting {{supplies}} and people to the goldfields often took three weeks. After every wet season the tracks and bridges had to be remade. A railway line from Cooktown to Maytown, was planned, but it took five years to get the 67 mi to Laura - {{and that is where}} it stopped. By that <b>time</b> the <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> petering out, so the Queensland Government refused further funding for the venture.|$|R
50|$|Beirut Stock Exchange, {{the second}} oldest {{market in the}} region, was {{established}} in 1920 by a decree of the French commissioner. Trading at that <b>time</b> <b>was</b> concentrated on <b>gold</b> and currency transactions, however in the 1930s there was an inflow of French, Syrian and local Lebanese investment which {{made it possible for}} the BSE to flourish, especially with the establishment of mixed Lebanese-French joint stock companies that were quoted simultaneously on the Paris and Beirut Stock Exchanges. The activity in the 1950s and 1960s increased with the enlisting of various banking, industrial and services companies along with an amount of 50 listed bonds.|$|R
