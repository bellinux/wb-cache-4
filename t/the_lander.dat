5|$|Maggie Faris (Amy Seimetz) is <b>the</b> <b>lander</b> pilot serving {{aboard the}} Covenant and Tennessee's wife. Faris pilots <b>the</b> <b>lander</b> {{carrying}} the excursion team {{down through the}} ionic storm, {{to the surface of}} the planet. While the excursion team makes their way to the crashed Engineer ship, Faris stays with <b>the</b> <b>lander,</b> to calibrate its instruments and communicate with Tennessee. She receives communications from Karine Oram that Ledward is ill, prompting her to prepare the medical bay. Upon seeing Ledward's deadly and potentially contagious condition, Faris locks Karine and him in the medical bay, refusing to allow Karine to escape. When the Neomorph emerges and escapes the room, Faris arms herself and attempts to kill it. In the process, she inadvertently damages <b>the</b> <b>lander,</b> causing it to explode. A burning Faris stumbles out of the ship and succumbs to her injuries on the foot ramp.|$|E
5|$|Sergeant Hallett (Nathaniel Dean) is a {{military}} officer aboard the Covenant and Sergeant Lope's husband. He embarks on the expedition {{to the source of}} Shaw's signal. At the entrance of the crashed Engineer ship, Hallett observes mutated floral pods, which he squeezes, causing the airborne mutagen to be inhaled through his nose. By the time the expedition departs from the crash site, Hallett begins to show symptoms of the parasite, which worries Lope. As they make their way back to <b>the</b> <b>lander,</b> Hallett's condition drastically deteriorates. Upon reaching <b>the</b> <b>lander,</b> which explodes, a Neomorph bursts from Hallett's throat, killing him.|$|E
5|$|Ledward (Benjamin Rigby) is {{a member}} of the {{security}} unit aboard the Covenant. He {{is a member}} of the expedition tracking the signal leading to the crashed Engineer ship on the surface of the Engineer homeworld. Shortly after disembarking from <b>the</b> <b>lander,</b> Ledward is assigned by Lope to escort Karine Oram as she takes samples from the local ecosystem. Ledward excuses himself from his duties momentarily to smoke and urinate, during which time, he disturbs a mutated floral pod, causing airborne mutagen to enter his ear canal. His health immediately deteriorates and he is assisted to <b>the</b> <b>lander</b> by Karine. Inside the lander's medical bay, Faris locks Ledward and Karine in the room, where the first Neomorph bursts out of his spine, killing him.|$|E

5|$|The Phoenix lander {{returned}} data showing Martian soil to {{be slightly}} alkaline and containing elements such as magnesium, sodium, potassium and chlorine. These nutrients are found in soils on Earth, and they are necessary for growth of plants.

5|$|Sergeant Lope (Demián Bichir) is {{the ranking}} {{military}} officer aboard the Covenant {{who is married}} to Sergeant Hallett. Lope leads the excursion on the planet's surface to the crashed Engineer ship. On the journey back to <b>the</b> <b>lander,</b> Lope notices Hallett's condition deteriorating, which alarms him. Upon reaching <b>the</b> <b>lander,</b> the ship explodes and a Neomorph attacks while another bursts from his husband's throat. A Neomorph attacks Lope when David intervenes and leads the survivors to his base, where Lope discovers Shaw's corpse. He is attacked by a Facehugger, but he is quickly and seemingly saved by Cole, who manages to cut it off him, though his face is severely burned by acid in the process. As Cole is killed by a now mature Alien, Lope escapes with the other survivors to the cargo lander. Aboard Covenant, Lope receives medical treatment, but dies when an Alien erupts from his chest, revealing that despite the short time that the Facehugger was on him, it succeeded in impregnating him.|$|E
5|$|Successive Reichsstatthalter decrees between 1933 and 1935 {{effectively}} {{abolished the}} existing Länder (constituent states) of Germany and {{replaced them with}} new administrative divisions, the Gaue, headed by NSDAP leaders (Gauleiters), who effectively became the governor of their respective regions. The change was never fully implemented, as <b>the</b> <b>Länder</b> were still used as administrative divisions for some government departments such as education. This led to a bureaucratic tangle of overlapping jurisdictions and responsibilities typical of the administrative style of the Nazi regime.|$|E

5|$|Ankor (Alexander England) is {{a member}} of the {{security}} unit aboard the Covenant. Shortly after awakening from the neutrino burst, he attempts to save Branson from his cryosleep pod, but he is unable to in time and the captain is burnt to death. Ankor assists Tennessee with the space walk for repairing the solar recharge sails. Ankor is a part of the expedition to the surface of the Engineer home world, where they set off to investigate the intercepted signal at the crashed Engineer ship. Upon returning to <b>the</b> <b>lander</b> and witnessing it explode, the expedition is ambushed by two Neomorphs. Ankor shoots one of them, but the creature responds by whipping his jaw off with its tail, killing him instantly.|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, Atari {{produced}} an arcade game {{version of the}} concept called Lunar Lander. This version featured monochrome vector graphics and allowed the player to rotate the ship right or left and fire thrusters controlled with a proportional throttle control system using a joystick with a spring. Like Moonlander, both a graphical display of a repeating mountainous surface {{as well as a}} text readout of the ship's speed, altitude, and remaining fuel are displayed. Once a game begins, it only ends when a player runs out of fuel, rather than due to a time limit; players can insert quarters to add fuel to their current game. Bonus points are awarded for landing on difficult parts of the map. The game features four levels of difficulty in controlling the ship. Lunar Lander was Atari's first vector graphics game and the first multiple-perspective video game; when <b>the</b> <b>lander</b> got close to the surface, the view changed to a close-up view of <b>the</b> <b>lander.</b> The vector engine was inspired by Space Wars (1978) and created by Rick Moncrief and Howard Delman, who developed Lunar Lander alongside Rich Moore. The idea for the game came from Delman, who had seen a graphical version of the game, likely Moonlander, a few years prior. At least one other arcade game based on the Lunar Lander concept was developed around the same time, Lunar Rescue by Taito.|$|E
5|$|Karine Oram (Carmen Ejogo) is a {{biologist}} aboard the Covenant {{who is married}} to Christopher Oram. After Branson dies and her husband becomes the new captain of the Covenant, Karine reassures him when he questions whether the crew respects him as their new leader. During the ground expedition towards the crashed Engineer ship, Karine diverts off the path to collect samples for research. Her escort, Ledward, becomes ill from his alien infestation, prompting Karine to help him back to <b>the</b> <b>lander.</b> While attempting to provide Ledward with medical assistance, Maggie Faris witnesses the beginnings of a severe infection on Ledward's back. Out of fear, she locks Karine in with him. A Neomorphs bursts out of Ledward's back and mauls Karine to death.|$|E

5|$|Christopher Oram (Billy Crudup) is {{the chief}} mate aboard the colony ship Covenant and the husband of Kariine Oram. With Branson's death {{as a result of}} the {{neutrino}} flair from the nearby star, Christopher becomes the captain of Covenant, though he perceives his command as being questioned by Daniels and the other crew members. When Shaw's transmission is received from the habitable Engineer home world, Christopher orders Covenant to divert to the planet, though his judgment is met with protests from Daniels. After leading a ground expedition to the crashed Engineer ship, Christopher returns to <b>the</b> <b>lander</b> to see it explode. Christopher accepts David's aid on behalf of the survivors and accompanies David back to his base. He searches for Rosenthal, who he finds decapitated, along with David communicating with the Neomorph that killed her. Christopher kills the Neomorph and holds David at gunpoint, demanding an explanation for his activities. David leads him to his makeshift laboratory, as well as a hatchery, where he keeps a number of Alien eggs. David goads Christopher into approaching an egg, which results in a Facehugger attacking and impregnating him. Christopher is awoken a short time later by David, only to have the first Alien chestburster erupt from his chest, killing him.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, DEC {{commissioned}} {{the creation of}} a real-time, graphical version of Lunar Lander, which was intended to showcase the capabilities of their new DEC GT40 graphics terminals, when connected to their PDP-10 or PDP-11 minicomputers. The game was written by Jack Burness, a DEC consultant, and named Moonlander; it was distributed with DEC computers and displayed at trade shows. Unlike the previous turn-based, textual games, Moonlander is a real-time graphical game. The goal remains to correctly land a lunar module {{on the surface of the}} moon using the game's telemetry data. If the player miscalculates the module's landing, the module will either fly off into space or crash into the moon's surface. The game is controlled with a light pen, and the output display was a vector graphics system; the light pen allowed adjusting the throttle value and the angle of the lunar lander. Burness has said that he does not recall playing the original Lunar, but that by 1973 there were numerous versions of the game which he had played. He based the calculations of the fuel consumption for maneuvering the rocket on the actual lunar lander specifications, which he obtained from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which co-designed <b>the</b> <b>lander.</b> The entire game was written in ten days.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>lander</b> {{arrived at}} night at 2:56:55 Mars local solar time (16:56:55 UTC) on July 4, 1997. <b>The</b> <b>lander</b> {{had to wait}} until sunrise to send its first digital signals and images to Earth. The landing site was located at 19.30° north {{latitude}} and 33.52° west longitude in Ares Vallis, only 19 kilometres southwest of the center of the 200km wide landing site ellipse. During Sol 1, the first Martian solar day <b>the</b> <b>lander</b> spent on the planet, <b>the</b> <b>lander</b> took pictures and made some meteorologic measurements. Once the data was received, the engineers realized that one of the airbags hadn't fully deflated and could be a problem for the forthcoming traverse of Sojourners descent ramp. To solve the problem, they sent commands to <b>the</b> <b>lander</b> to raise one of its petals and perform additional retraction to flatten the airbag. The procedure was a success and on Sol 2, Sojourner was released, stood up and backed down one of two ramps.|$|E
50|$|A camera {{mounted on}} <b>the</b> <b>lander's</b> arm can capture {{black and white}} images of the {{instruments}} on <b>the</b> <b>lander's</b> deck and a 3-D view of the ground where the seismometer and heat flow probe will be placed. It will then {{be used to help}} engineers and scientists guide the deployment of the instruments to the ground. With a 45-degree field of view, the camera will also provide a panoramic view of the terrain surrounding the landing site. A second similar camera, with a wide-angle 120-degree field of view lens will be mounted under the edge of <b>the</b> <b>lander's</b> deck and will provide a complementary view of the instrument deployment area.|$|R

25|$|The landing {{was made}} on a flat surface, with <b>the</b> <b>lander</b> {{reporting}} only 0.3 degrees of tilt. Just before landing, the craft used its thrusters to orient its solar panels along an east-west axis to maximize power generation. <b>The</b> <b>lander</b> waited 15 minutes before opening its solar panels, to allow dust to settle. The first images from <b>the</b> <b>lander</b> became available around 7:00p.m. PDT (2008-05-26 02:00 UTC). The images show a surface strewn with pebbles and incised with small troughs into polygons about 5 m across and 10cm high, with the expected absence of large rocks and hills.|$|E
25|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>lander</b> was 355 m {{above the}} ground, airbags were {{inflated}} {{in less than}} a second using three catalytically cooled solid rocket motors that served as gas generators. The airbags were made of 4 inter-connected multi-layer vectran bags that surrounded the tetrahedron lander. They were designed and tested to accommodate grazing angle impacts as high as 28m/s. However, as the airbags were designed for no more than about 15m/s vertical impacts, three solid retrorockets were mounted above <b>the</b> <b>lander</b> in the backshell. These were fired at 98m above the ground. The lander's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that <b>the</b> <b>lander</b> velocity would be reduced to about 0m/s between 15 and 25m above the ground. After 2.3 seconds, while the rockets were still firing, <b>the</b> <b>lander</b> cut the bridle loose about 21.5m above the ground and fell to the ground. The rockets flew up and away with the backshell and parachute (they have since been sighted by orbital images). <b>The</b> <b>lander</b> impacted at 14m/s and limited the impact to only 18G of deceleration. The first bounce was 15.7m high and continued bouncing for at least 15 additional bounces (accelerometer data recording did not continue through all of the bounces).|$|E
