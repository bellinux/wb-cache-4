5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{was one of}} {{the first}} games {{concurrently}} released on CD-ROM and floppy disk. A floppy disk version was created to accommodate consumers that had yet to purchase CD-ROM drives. <b>The</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> format afforded the addition of audible dialog. The capacity difference between the two formats necessitated alterations to the floppy disk version. Grossman spent several weeks reducing files sizes and removing files such as the audio dialog to fit the game onto six diskettes.|$|E

This version is part of the Another World 15th Anniversary Edition CD-ROM released in 2007, which also includes a development diary, an exclusive postcard autographed by Chahi and a separate soundtrack CD. <b>The</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> version of 15th Anniversary Edition contains strict digital rights management technology– upon installation, the game verifies the user's serial number through the Internet, allowing only for five installations of the game using any given serial number. Uninstallation does not reset the count, so after five installations, the player must purchase a new copy. This problem does not exist on the digital copy sold by GOG.com.|$|E

Meshuggah's previous two releases, 1998's Chaosphere and 1995's Destroy Erase Improve, have sold 38,773 and 30,712 copies to that date, respectively. The CD booklet of Nothing has no liner notes, lyrics, or credits, only a hint of one word: ingenting, which is Swedish for nothing.

5|$|Once Chrono Trigger was completed, {{the team}} resumed discussions for Final Fantasy VII in 1995. The team {{reviewed}} {{the option of}} continuing the 2D strategy, {{which would have been}} the safe and immediate path just prior to the imminent industry shift toward the future of 3D gaming, and the radical new development models that these 3D consoles would require. The team decided to take the riskier option and make a 3D game on new generation hardware, but had yet to choose between the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 or <b>the</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> based PlayStation from Sony Computer Entertainment. The team also considered Sega's new Saturn console and the Microsoft Windows personal computer (PC). Their decision was influenced by two things: a tech demo based on Final Fantasy VI created using the new Softimage 3D software that impressed both staff and external developers, and the escalating price of cartridge-based games, which was limiting Square's audience. Tests were made for a Nintendo 64 version of the game, which would use the planned 64DD peripheral, {{even in the face of}} a lack of 64DD development kits and the prototype device's changing hardware specifications. This version was discarded during early testing, as the 2000 polygons needed to render the Behemoth monster put too much of a strain on the Nintendo 64 hardware, causing a low frame rate. It was later estimated that it would have required thirty 64DD discs to run Final Fantasy VII properly with the data compression methods of the day. Faced with both technical and economic issues on Nintendo's current hardware, and favorably impressed by the increased storage capacity of CD-ROM when compared to the Nintendo 64 cartridge, Square shifted development of Final Fantasy VII in addition to all other planned game projects, onto Sony's PlayStation.|$|E

Britannica countered by offering a CD-ROM version of their product, although it could not generate the print version's $500–600 in sales commissions. Britannica decided to charge $995 for just <b>the</b> <b>CD-ROM,</b> while bundling a free disc with the print version, hoping that including <b>the</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> would persuade buyers {{to stay with the}} brand.|$|E

40|$|CD-ROM {{affordances}} are {{explored in}} this article through participation in classroom interaction. CD-ROMs for shared reading of animated stories and language work were introduced to all Malaysian primary schools in 2003 for the Year 1 English Literacy Hour. We present classroom interaction extracts that show how <b>the</b> same <b>CD-ROMs</b> offer different affordances in their support of seven teaching styles differentiated along eight dimensions. The meaning potential of <b>the</b> <b>CD-ROMs</b> emerges as teachers make salient different combinations of modes in the materials. Despite these interactional differences, <b>the</b> introduction of <b>CD-ROMs</b> is essentially a ‘benign addition’ in that it generates interest and motivation among students and is appreciated by teachers for ‘lightening the load’, but {{has done little to}} transform traditional ways of teaching in these Year 1 classrooms: {{there was no evidence of}} the increased interaction and student participation desired by the Ministry. Our findings resonate with research internationally which calls for clear guidelines about ‘what works’. Our classification of teaching styles based on interactions afforded by <b>the</b> Malaysian <b>CD-ROMs</b> enables us to identify what might work in different contexts...|$|R

By 1996 {{the price of}} <b>the</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> had dropped to $200, and sales had dropped to $325 million—about half of their 1990 levels.

Facing financial pressure, Britannica was bought in 1996 by Swiss financier Jacob Safra for $135 million, a fraction of its book value. Safra introduced severe price-cutting measures to try to compete with Encarta, even offering the entire reference free of charge for a time (around 18 months, from October 1999 to March 2001) on the Internet.|$|E
