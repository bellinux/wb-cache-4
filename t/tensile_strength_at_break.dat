The <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and {{elongation}} <b>at</b> <b>break</b> of epoxidized {{natural rubber}} (ENR) was investigated by adding different concentration of calcium stearate. Two grades of {{epoxidized natural rubber}} (ENR), namely, ENR 25 and ENR 40 were used as model materials. Semi-efficient vulcanization (semi-EV) was used throughout the study. The tensile property of unaged and aged ENR vulcanizates was determined by using U-CAN electron tensile testing machine. Results indicate that <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> of unaged ENR 25 and ENR 40 vulcanizates increase gradually with increasing concentration of calcium stearate up to about 1 phr of calcium stearate and after which, the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> drop with a further increase in calcium stearate loading. For a similar alcium stearate concentration, the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> of ENR 40 vulcanizates exhibits a consistently higher value than that of ENR 25 vulcanizates, {{which is due to}} the higher crosslink density of ENR 40 which contains more epoxide groups than ENR 25.

40|$|A {{composite}} {{made from}} the flexsible plastic waste and saw dust was studied. The objectives {{of this research was}} to find the optimum ratio of the flexible plastic waste and saw dust in its application on a floor tile. The investigated ratio of flexible plastic waste / saw dust were 100 / 0; 90 / 10; 80 / 20; 70 / 30; 60 / 40; and 50 / 50 respectively. The composites were prepared on a rheocord- 90 machine at 600 C for 10 minutes. The composites were tested for their physical properties I, e flexibility, dimensional stability, curling, volatility, <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> elongation <b>at</b> <b>break,</b> and hardness. The physical properties testing result show that a composite by using the flexible plastic waste and saw dust in comparation of 90 / 10 could meet the requirements of SNI 03 / 4060 / 1996 for Vinyl Floor. The increasing saw dust content in composites decreased <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> elongation <b>at</b> <b>break,</b> flexibility, and hardness, but increased dimensional stability, and volatility. <b>Tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of all composites was higher than particle board...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Alumina nano-crystals were {{dispersed}} in {{epoxy resin}} via different approaches. The effects of filler dispersion on the mechanical {{properties of the}} epoxy/alumina nanocomposites were studied. The fracture mechanisms are investigated using SEM. The {{results show that the}} Young’s modulus, <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> and fracture toughness of epoxy were improved dramatically with the incorporation of well-dispersed alumina nano-crystals. The poorly-dispersed nano-crystals, however, showed little effects on the mechanical properties...|$|R
