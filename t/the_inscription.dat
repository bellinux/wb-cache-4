5|$|After the {{surprise}} death of Malamir in 836, the Bulgarian throne passed to Presian I (836–852), who too was likely underage. As {{evidenced by the}} Presian Inscription from Philippi, Isbul retained his position as kavhan and his decisive influence in the Bulgarian court. In 837, the Slavic tribe of the Smolyani (Smolenoi), who inhabited the lower Nestos (Mesta) River and Western Thrace near Drama, rose against their Byzantine rulers. <b>The</b> <b>inscription</b> of Philippi mentions large-scale Bulgarian activity in the lands of the Smolyani. The Bulgarian forces were led by Isbul, {{as well as the}} ichirgu-boil (commander of the capital garrison) and the head priest. As <b>the</b> <b>inscription</b> is damaged, it is unclear who Presian and Isbul supported in that conflict. However, during this campaign the Bulgarian army conquered most of Macedonia including Philippi, where <b>the</b> <b>inscription</b> was found. From that point on, Isbul disappears from the sources, and there is no information about the date and circumstances of his death.|$|E

5|$|Every runic {{inscription}} {{is shown}} with its ID code {{that is used}} in scholarly literature to refer to <b>the</b> <b>inscription,</b> {{and it is only}} obligatory to give the first two parts of it. The first part is one or two letters that represent the area where the runic inscription appears, e.g. U for Uppland, Sö for Södermanland and DR for Denmark. The second part represents the order in which <b>the</b> <b>inscription</b> is presented in official national publications (e.g. Sveriges runinskrifter). Thus U 73 means that the runestone was the 73rd runic inscription in Uppland that was documented in Sveriges runinskrifter. If <b>the</b> <b>inscription</b> was documented later than the official publication, it is listed according to the publication where it was first described, e.g. Sö Fv1954;20, where Sö represents Södermanland, Fv stands for the annual publication Fornvännen, 1954 is the year of the issue of Fornvännen and 20 is the page in the publication.|$|E
5|$|Hairan I: {{the name}} appears on a 251 {{inscription}} from Palmyra describing him as Ras implying {{that he was}} already an adult by then. In the Augustan History, Odaenathus' eldest son is named Herod; <b>the</b> <b>inscription</b> at Palmyra dating to 263 celebrating Hairan's coronation mentions him with the name Herodianus. It is possible that Hairan of the 251 inscription {{is not the same}} as Herodianus of the 263, but this is contested by Hartmann who conclude that the reason for the difference in the spelling is due to the language used in <b>the</b> <b>inscription</b> (Herodianus being the Greek version), meaning that Odaenathus' eldest son and co-king is Hairan Herodianus.|$|E

5|$|Most {{scholars}} now attribute <b>the</b> <b>inscription</b> to Tiridates I. Considering that <b>the</b> <b>inscription</b> {{says the}} temple {{was built in}} the eleventh year of reign of Tiridates I, the temple {{is believed to have been}} completed in 77 AD. The date is primarily linked to Tiridates I's visit to Rome in 66 AD, where he was crowned by Roman emperor Nero. To rebuild the city of Artaxata, destroyed by the Roman general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, Nero gave Tiridates 50 million drachmas and provided him with Roman craftsmen. Upon his return to Armenia Tiridates began a major project of reconstruction, which included rebuilding the fortified city of Garni. It is during this period that the temple is thought to have been built.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Tugu <b>inscription</b> {{was written}} in Pallawa script {{arranged}} {{in the form of}} Sanskrit Sloka with Anustubh metrum, consisting of five lines that run around the surface of the stone. Just like other <b>inscriptions</b> from <b>the</b> Tarumanagara kingdom, <b>the</b> Tugu <b>inscriptions</b> do not mention the date of the edict. The date of <b>the</b> <b>inscriptions</b> was estimated and analyzed according to paleographic study which concluded that <b>the</b> <b>inscriptions</b> originated from <b>the</b> mid 5th century. The script of <b>the</b> Tugu <b>inscription</b> and <b>the</b> Cidanghyang <b>inscription</b> bear striking similarity, such as the script [...] "citralaikha" [...] written as [...] "citralekha", leading to the assumption that the writer of these <b>inscriptions</b> was <b>the</b> same person.|$|R

5|$|The {{identity}} of the woman {{has also been a}} matter of debate. <b>The</b> <b>inscription</b> which accompanies her image clearly includes her title, despotissa, as well as the word “daughter”. Based on a possible reading of her name as Anna, she has been identified as Anna Neda, the Serbian wife of Michael Shishman, which is in line with the first identification of the despot. Nikolova believes that {{it is possible that the}} woman is Anna Neda even if the despot is her son rather than her husband. She theorises that Anna Neda settled in Vidin after Michael Shishman's second marriage and owned a personal domain which included Donja Kamenica. Another reading of <b>the</b> <b>inscription</b> deciphers the name of the despotissa as Elena.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>inscriptions</b> from Khirbet Beit Lei and Khirbet el-Q?m were {{originally}} situated in hewn burial caves {{in the southern}} Shephelah. Since their original publication in 1963 and 1970 respectively, new technologies have become available for photographing epigraphic material. Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is a technique that combines multiple light angles to facilitate enhanced views of the object. This dissertation uses new photographs {{as the basis for}} a fresh assessment of <b>the</b> cave <b>inscriptions.</b> Building upon previous paleographic and archaeological analyses of <b>the</b> <b>inscriptions</b> and their setting, this study presents an integrative analysis of the source and purposes of <b>the</b> <b>inscriptions</b> in context. Viewing <b>the</b> <b>inscriptions</b> as physical objects, the production and preservation of which involved numerous processes, each of which were socially and culturally informed, facilitates a more holistic treatment of <b>the</b> <b>inscriptions.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>inscriptions</b> are examined in the context of various classifications of inscribing, such as informal inscribing, ritual inscribing and mortuary inscribing, a number of themes emerge. <b>The</b> cave <b>inscriptions</b> represent commemorative inscribing, physically memorializing identities and events on the tomb walls. Overwriting and other repetitious inscribing illustrate the importance of the act of inscribing and hint at a ritual or performative use of writing. The unique combination of texts and images along with the burial setting and placement of <b>the</b> <b>inscriptions</b> betray an innovative use of both the content and the space. Given the context of conflict besetting the kingdom of Judah during much of the Iron Age IIB, there are multiple possibilities regarding the more specific impetus for <b>the</b> <b>inscriptions.</b> While {{it is not possible to}} ascertain whether or not <b>the</b> <b>inscriptions</b> were associated with the burial use of the tombs, this contextual study highlights the fact that the inscribers would have already been affiliated with the space and that they selected the tomb setting because the meaning of the space aligned with the purposes of the inscribing...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>inscriptions</b> contain several {{instances}} {{of the use}} of pentadic numerals in arabic placement. The first to study the stones scientifically was Harvard University professor Einar Haugen. In 1974, after transcribing, he found the individual runes used to be inconsistent with 11th century Old Norse, and that the text contains only [...] "a few Norse words in a sea of gibberish". He also noted peculiarities relating <b>the</b> <b>inscriptions</b> directly to <b>the</b> Kensington Runestone <b>inscription.</b> Thus, he concluded that <b>the</b> <b>inscriptions</b> were most likely created after 1932.|$|R
