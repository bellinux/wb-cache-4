To the point where it has now caused what they call post-traumatic epilepsy. It's not a full-blown epilepsy attack, but more of a dizzy spell, sort of a blackout type.

500|$|Although he socialized {{with his}} {{teammates}} and sometimes gambled, Sunday {{was never a}} heavy drinker. In his autobiography, he said, [...] "I never drank much. I was never drunk but four <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. ... I {{used to go to}} the saloons with the baseball players, and while they would drink highballs and gin fizzes and beer, I would take lemonade." [...] Following his conversion, Sunday denounced drinking, swearing, and gambling, and he changed his behavior, which was recognized by both teammates and fans. Shortly thereafter, Sunday began speaking in churches and at YMCAs.|$|E

It included his pledge to [...] "uphold personal fidelity to my spouse".|$|E
500|$|By the Way was lauded {{by critics}} as a {{departure}} from the band's previous styles, and is recognized for the melodic and subdued emotions given by the Chili Peppers. Guitarist John Frusciante is credited with writing most of the album's melodies, bass lines and guitar progressions, therefore changing the direction of the recording dramatically: [...] "his warm, understated guitar work and his doo-wop style vocal harmonies are king this time around." [...] By the Way contained very little of the signature punk-funk fusion the band had become known for playing. Frusciante has stated that writing [...] "By the Way [...] one of the happiest <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] The album went on to sell more than 8 million copies worldwide.|$|E

500|$|After {{trying out}} with the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds, Koufax did {{the same for the}} Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field. During his Pirates tryout, Koufax's fastball broke the thumb of Sam Narron, the team's bullpen coach. Branch Rickey, then the general manager of the Pirates, told his scout Clyde Sukeforth that Koufax had the [...] "greatest arm [...] ever seen". The Pirates, however, failed to offer Koufax a {{contract}} until after he was already committed to the Dodgers. Dodgers scout Al Campanis heard about Koufax from a local sporting goods store owner. After seeing Koufax pitch for Lafayette, Campanis invited him to an Ebbets Field tryout. With Dodgers manager Walter Alston and scouting director Fresco Thompson watching, Campanis assumed the hitter's stance while Koufax started throwing. Campanis later said, [...] "There are two <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life the hair on my arms has stood up: The first time I saw the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and the second time, I saw Sandy Koufax throw a fastball." [...] The Dodgers signed Koufax for a $6,000 ($ today) salary, with a $14,000 ($ today) signing bonus. Koufax planned to use the money as tuition to finish his university education, if his baseball career failed.|$|E
500|$|Also in 1908, Jack London {{broke his}} silence on his {{condemnation}} during the controversy by publishing {{an essay in}} Collier's Weekly entitled [...] "The Other Animals". Directly addressing Roosevelt's past criticism of his novels, London called the President [...] "homocentric" [...] and [...] "amateur". He further wrote: [...] "I have been guilty of writing two animal—two books about dogs. The writing of these two stories, on my part, was in truth a protest against the 'humanizing' of animals, of which {{it seemed to me}} several 'animal writers' had been profoundly guilty. Time and again, and many <b>times,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> narratives, I wrote, speaking of my dog-heroes: 'He did not think these things; he merely did them,' etc. And I did this repeatedly, to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons; and I did it in order to hammer into the average human understanding that these dog-heroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning, but by instinct, sensation, and emotion, and by simple reasoning. Also, I endeavored to make my stories in line with the facts of evolution; I hewed them to the mark set by scientific research, and awoke, one day, to find myself bundled neck and crop into the camp of the nature-fakers." ...|$|E

In Australia, she also did {{a photo shoot}} for Aaliyah with photographers Jeff Dunas, Jonathan Mannion, David LaChapelle, and Albert Watson. Aaliyah handled five pythons at the shoot and developed an affinity for snakes, finding them [...] "dangerous, but quite beautiful" [...] and representative of her on the album. She revisited the snake theme in her music video for [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] in April and told MTV, [...] "They live in solitude, [...] there are <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life [...] I {{just want to be}} by myself. There are times I can't even figure myself out. I feel they are very complex creatures, [...] at the same time, they're sexy, too. That's why they represent Aaliyah pretty well." [...] She described the record as [...] "a good reflection of [...] and the person [...] today", saying in an interview for Jet magazine, [...] "I am a young adult now, and I think this album shows my growth vocally."

500|$|For {{the first}} time in her career, Gomez was given full {{creative}} control following her signing with Interscope Records. She expressed frustration and constraint with the songs chosen for her earlier in her career, and felt a disconnect from the music both personally and professionally. During the creation of Revival, the singer emphasized the importance of creating a distinct sound for herself, telling Nolan Feeney of Time that [...] "there were <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> career where I sang things that just weren’t me and weren’t for me. You can hear it in my voice. You can hear it when it’s inauthentic." [...] Gomez aimed to create autobiographical songs which shared personal stories, whether or not she wrote them. Citing the therapeutic process of writing [...] "The Heart Wants What It Wants" [...] for her greatest hits album For You (2014), the singer was inspired to separate herself from her peers and convert personal experiences into the music of Revival. For [...] "Sober", Gomez focused on using her unique vocal tone and abilities as an actress to translate feelings and emotions through her music. The singer also told producers to focus primarily on the lyrics and vocals, referencing albums of her youth that dealt with themes of growing up in the spotlight, particularly Christina Aguilera's album Stripped (2002).|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, {{director}} Baz Luhrmann cast Jackman {{to replace}} Russell Crowe as the male lead in his much-publicized epic film, Australia, which co-starred Nicole Kidman.

Of the movie, Jackman said, [...] "This is pretty much one of those roles that had me pinching myself {{all the way through}} the shoot. I got to shoot a big-budget, shamelessly old-fashioned romantic epic set against one of the most turbulent <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> native country's history, while, at the same time, celebrating that country's natural beauty, its people, its cultures....

2500|$|Reid was Wainwright's {{personal}} {{choice for the}} role of Celia, describing the actress as [...] "so down to earth and compelling to watch". Reid had tired of playing older characters for whom their age was a defining characteristic, stating that she had been sent lots of scripts wherein [...] "where the minute anyone's over 65, they turn into a doddering old idiot". She hoped that Last Tango in Halifax would [...] "give hope to older people", opining that the relationship between Celia and Alan was free from ageism. Reid identified herself with Celia's personality— believing herself to be quite reckless and outgoing— though stated that unlike her character she has no desire to enter another relationship. She enjoyed working with her friend Sarah Lancashire, who previously played her onscreen daughter in Rose and Maloney, [...] and suggested that the two share similar looks. Reid described filming the series as [...] "one of the best <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> career" [...] and stated that she was proud of the work put in.

2500|$|Fitzwilliam {{wrote to}} Laurence on 22 February 1797 {{that he did}} not wish for a change in {{government}} lest it [...] "lead to a change in the constitution" [...] but agreed that a [...] "reform in the abuses of executive government" [...] was needed and that Fox would carry on the war [...] "for the same reason , and peace would be made by him more to advantage, because, made by him, there would be virtually a saving of the country's honour—made by Mr Pitt, the country is beat into it' made by Mr Fox it is a measure of choice". In March 1797 he looked with sympathy on a scheme by MPs and peers to form a government without Pitt and wrote a Memorial on the state of Ireland in which he called for Emancipation and the sacking of anti-Catholic members of the Irish government, which would reconcile Catholics to British rule and halt the spread of Jacobinism. He spoke in the Lords to put forward these proposals but it was rejected by 72 votes to 20. Fitzwilliam wrote on 2 April that he was [...] "the most isolated individual in politics in the king's dominions...a person who approves of nothing doing and therefore of no set of men whatever". The government had abandoned its principles and the Foxites were [...] "more hostile in ten <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion, and more decided to act upon principles contrary to my views, than the Ministry". On 30 May Fitzwilliam met Burke at his home in Beaconsfield during his last illness before his death. Burke reported to Laurence that Fitzwilliam had [...] "a strong predilection to Mr Fox" [...] and [...] "influenced, too much so in my opinion, though very naturally and very excusably, by a rooted animosity against Mr Pitt". Fitzwilliam returned to his previous independence when the scheme for a [...] "third party" [...] collapsed and Laurence wrote to Fitzwilliam on 9 July (the day of Burke's death) that Burke had said on his deathbed: [...] "Inform Lord Fitzwilliam from me that it is my dying advice and request to him, steadily to pursue that course in which he now is. He can take no other that will not be unworthy of him". Laurence said [...] "this was almost if not quite the last thing which he said on public affairs". Fitzwilliam wrote to Laurence on 11 July of Burke's death: ...|$|E
