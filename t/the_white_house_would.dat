5|$|Since {{it never}} reached a target, the exact place {{intended}} {{to be hit by}} Flight93 has never been decisively confirmed. Before the attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden, and Mohammed Atef developed a list of potential targets. Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed wanted to strike the World Trade Center and all three wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden told 9/11 planner Ramzi bin al-Shibh to advise Mohamed Atta that he preferred the White House over the Capitol as a target. Atta cautioned bin al-Shibh that this would be difficult, but agreed to include the White House as a possible target and suggested they keep the Capitol as an alternative in case the White House proved too difficult. Eventually, Atta told bin al-Shibh that Jarrah planned to hit the Capitol. Atta briefly mentioned the possibility of striking a nuclear facility, but balked after the other attack pilots voiced their opposition. Based on an exchange between Atta and bin al-Shibh two days before the attacks, <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>would</b> be the primary target for the fourth plane and the Capitol the secondary target.|$|E

25|$|The {{day after}} the decision, Gould says, Truesdale came {{into his office and}} {{subjected}} him to loud verbal abuse (which devolved into a shouting match) because Truesdale was upset that Gould had spoken to the New York Times about the Board's decision. Gould lunched with Mikva after the incident, at which time Mikva allegedly counseled Gould to allow Truesdale and the other Board members to write opinions supporting their votes in this high-profile case. Gould was unwilling to do this, and told Mikva that Truesdale was too deferential to the General Counsel's requests to make that a valuable exercise. On March 28, Gould learned that Truesdale was about to publish comments critical of Gould's contacts with the press during the baseball strike. Gould asked Mikva if <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>would</b> be willing to privately discipline Truesdale, but Mikva indicated it would not.|$|E

Anonymous sources within the Government of India told The Telegraph that they were hopeful Fontes's appointment in <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>would</b> help convey New Delhi's concerns. Senior officials familiar with Fontes commented upon her understanding of India's security concerns vis-à-vis China and Pakistan; that she would be a friendly face among a Trump Administration cabinet mostly unknown to India.

Acting U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam William Trueheart warned Nguyễn Đình Thuận, Diệm's Secretary of State, of the desperate need for an agreement, saying that the situation was [...] "dangerously near breaking point" [...] and expected Diệm would meet the Buddhists' five-point manifesto.

500|$|The idea {{of using}} the sturdy Treasury Building as a refuge of last resort has some precedent. Immediately after the Battle of Fort Sumter in 1861, there was concern that an attack on Washington was imminent. General Winfield Scott had the {{building}} readied {{to be used as}} a [...] "last stand" [...] by the federal government in the event the capital city was overrun. The exterior of the building was ringed with sandbags and soldiers, and inside corridors and hallways leading to the underground vaults were barricaded [...] "floor to ceiling". In the event of an unstoppable assault against the capital, plans had been drawn up for surviving U.S. Army forces to fight from three centers of final resistance with the Treasury Building as the [...] "citadel" [...] of the third.

Renovation of the property was delayed when Eisenhower became supreme commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1951. After he had attained the presidency of the United States in 1953, Mamie had him rebuild the old house. Much of the original building had to be torn down, due to its deterioration. The total cost of renovation was $250,000 (equal to $ today). This large expense was due partly to Mamie's whims, but also to Eisenhower's employment of union labor; he spent $65,000 (equal to $ today) for union workmen who came each day from Washington, D.C. ( [...] away) to work on the farmhouse. On their 1955 wedding anniversary, the Eisenhowers held a party to celebrate completion of the work.

2500|$|The next day, {{a team of}} FBI {{agents and}} Justice {{prosecutors}} investigating the leak questioned the deputy secretary. Armitage acknowledged that he had passed along to Novak information contained in a classified State Department memo: that Wilson's wife worked on weapons-of-mass-destruction issues at the CIA... felt obligated to inform White House counsel Alberto Gonzales. But Powell and his aides feared <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>would</b> then leak that Armitage had been Novak's source – possibly to embarrass State Department officials who had been unenthusiastic about Bush's Iraq policy. So Taft told Gonzales the bare minimum: that the State Department had passed some information about the case to Justice. He didn't mention Armitage. Taft asked if Gonzales {{wanted to know the}} details. The president's lawyer, playing the case by the book, said no, and Taft told him nothing more. Armitage's role thus remained that rarest of Washington phenomena: a hot secret that never leaked.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} month, Capp {{was charged}} in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, {{in connection with}} another alleged incident following his April 1 lecture at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. Capp was accused of propositioning a married woman in his hotel room. Although no sexual act was alleged to have resulted, the original charge included [...] "sodomy." [...] As part of a plea agreement, Capp pleaded guilty {{to the charge of}} [...] "attempted adultery" [...] (adultery was a felony in Wisconsin) and the other charges were dropped. Capp was fined $500 and court costs. In a December 1992 article for The New Yorker, Seymour Hersh reported that President Richard Nixon and Charles Colson had repeatedly discussed the Capp case in Oval Office recordings that had recently been made available by the National Archives. Nixon and Capp were on friendly terms, Hersh wrote, and Nixon and Colson had worked to find a way for Capp to run against Ted Kennedy for the U.S. Senate. [...] "Nixon was worried about the allegations, fearing that Capp's very close links to <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>would</b> become embarrassingly public," [...] Hersh wrote. [...] "The White House tapes and documents show that he and Colson discussed the issue repeatedly, and that Colson eventually reassured the President by saying that he had, in essence, fixed the case. Specifically, the President was told that one of Colson's people had gone to Wisconsin and tried to talk to the prosecutors." [...] Colson's efforts failed, however. The Eau Claire district attorney, a Republican, refused to dismiss the attempted adultery charge. In passing sentence in February 1972, the judge rejected the D.A.'s motion that Capp agree to undergo psychiatric treatment.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1997, Weld was {{nominated}} to become United States Ambassador to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. His nomination stalled after Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman Jesse Helms refused {{to hold a}} hearing on the nomination, effectively blocking it. Helms was also a Republican and their party held the majority in the chamber, but Helms objected to Weld's moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights, abortion rights, and the legalization of medical marijuana. This refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former United States Attorney General and friend of Helms, Edwin Meese. Meese reportedly had a long-standing grudge against Weld stemming from Weld's investigation of Meese during the Iran-Contra affair. Meese denied the speculation, asserting that he wished to keep his distance from Weld. Weld publicly criticized Helms, which the White House discouraged him from doing, but Weld relished the opportunity, saying: [...] "It feels like being in a campaign. I feel newly energized. I love to stir up the pot. I seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up." [...] Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that Weld's chances of being confirmed weren't [...] "very good, and that he hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for." [...] There was speculation that <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>would</b> let his nomination [...] "die", but he refused, saying that he hoped President Clinton [...] "does not plan to give in to ideological extortion" [...] and that [...] "I wanted to send a message that I wanted to be captain of my ship [...] even if it's going to bottom." [...] Some speculated that attacking the more conservative Helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate Republicans in a potential run for president in 2000, but he rejected this, saying that [...] "I've {{had a lot of people}} come up to me on the street and say, 'Give 'em hell. That's the Bill Weld we know and love.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The House responded on September 11 {{that they}} {{unanimously}} {{disagreed with the}} Senate amendment, and agreed to a conference. They then attempted to make a number of changes to the bill however {{it was not enough}} for Republican Senators Larry Craig, John Sununu and Lisa Murkowski, and Democratic Senators Dick Durbin, Russ Feingold and Ken Salazar, who wrote a letter threatening to block the bill if further changes were not made. The House duly proposed a House report, which was incorporated into a Conference report, which was then presented to the Senate. However, the Senate rejected the report, and on December 16 refused to end debate on legislation to renew the Act. A cloture motion was then ordered, but it failed, having fallen seven votes short of invoking closure on the matter, leaving the future of the Act in doubt. The vote went as follows: Fifty Republicans as well as two Democrats voted unsuccessfully to end debate; Five Republicans, 41 Democrats and one independent voted to block. With the sunsets threatening to expire, on December 21 the U.S. Senate came to a bipartisan agreement (S.2167) to extend by six months the expiring provisions of the Act. Under House rules, the House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner had the authority to block enactment of the six-month extension. On the following day, the House rejected the six-month extension and voted for a one-month extension, which the Senate subsequently approved later that night. However, on February 1, the House voted to again extend the sunsets to March 10. The reauthorization Act was finally passed on March 2 by the Senate with a vote of 95-4, though this was opposed by Senator Feingold who unsuccessfully attempted to extend the sunsets. The House voted 280-138 in favour of authorizing the Act. Finally, on March 8, President Bush signed the reauthorization Act, declaring that [...] "The Patriot Act has served America well, yet we cannot let the fact that America has not been attacked since September the 11th lull us into the illusion that the terrorist threat has disappeared" [...] and that <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>would</b> [...] "continue to give [...] the tools to get the job done." [...] However, after the ceremony, he issued a signing statement that [...] "The executive branch shall construe the provisions of H.R. 3199 that call for furnishing information to entities outside the executive branch, such as sections 106A and 119, {{in a manner consistent with}} the President's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and to withhold information the disclosure of which could impair foreign relations, national security, the deliberative processes of the Executive, or the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties" [...] in other words, he would not feel bound to comply with some of the provisions of the law if they conflicted with other Constitutional laws. This immediately drew a sharp rebuke from Senator Leahy, who condemned the statement as [...] "nothing short of a radical effort to re-shape the constitutional separation of powers and evade accountability and responsibility for following the law ... The President’s signing statements are not the law, and we should not allow them to be the last word. The President’s constitutional duty is to faithfully execute the laws as written by the Congress.
