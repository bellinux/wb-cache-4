25|$|Christmas tree {{farming is}} a labor-intensive process. Depending {{on the quality}} of the land, {{bulldozing}} may need to be undertaken prior to planting, in order to remove obstacles such as large trees or rocks. If the volume of undergrowth requires it, the soil may be tilled; tilling can help remove any debris remaining after tree or weed removal. Both woody plants and herbaceous weeds must be controlled prior to planting; this is most often done by application of a chemical herbicide. In addition, some types of fertilizers must be introduced into the soil prior to planting. The work done before planting tree seedlings plays an important role in the overall success of a Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>crop.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Between 1925 and 1935 Pinus radiata {{was first}} {{introduced}} as a commercial <b>tree</b> <b>crop,</b> to the district - as the trees were found not to be adversely affected by the local soil deficiencies. [...] As the initial crops matured, Tokoroa was then developed as a residential satellite for Kinleith Mill workers (New Zealand Forest Products Limited's integrated timber, pulp and paper mill), approximately 8km south of the township. [...] In 1948, Tokoroa had a population of 1,100. By the early 1970s, however, Tokoroa reached, for a time, a population of over 20,000 - the number necessary to be officially deemed a city. [...] In the 1980s years NZFP (and later, mill-owner Carter Holt Harvey Ltd) began to downscale and restructure operations at Kinleith. Tokoroa's population fell to approximately 18,000. Since the late 1980s ongoing downscaling at Kinleith - and closing of other local industries - {{has resulted in a}} marked drop in population. Census figures put the 2006 population at approximately 13,600.|$|E

Large areas of natural and regenerated forest have been cleared for growing oil palm, rubber, cocoa, coffee, and other perennial <b>tree</b> <b>crops.</b> These crops grown both on large scale plantations and by smallholders are important {{source of income for}} many farmers in tropical regions. It is generally assumed that a perennial tree cover protects the soil better against erosion than do annual <b>crops.</b> But <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> may require several years to close their canopy, whereas most annual crops provide adequate cover within six weeks after planting.

40|$|ABSTACT: The study {{compared}} {{the economic benefits}} derived from gum arabic production and some selected <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> in Adamawa and Yobe States, Nigeria {{in order to assess}} their impact of poverty alleviation on the respondents. Primary data were collected through the use of structured questionnaire administered on 150 farmers, out of which 104 were retrieved and used for the study. The data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The result indicated that majority of the respondents (48. 08 %) were between the ages of 41 – 50 years and all the respondents had one form of education or the order with majority (44. 23 %) obtained either HND or Degree. Most of them (42. 3 %) and (38. 46 %) operated on small scale (1 - 5 ha) for gum arabic and the other <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> respectively. Only 3. 85 % and 1. 92 % of the respondents operated on large scale (26 ha and above) for gum arabic and other <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> respectively. Also, 63. 46 % of respondents practiced intercropping gum arabic with some other crops. The profitability analyses show that 2, 725, 000. 00 and 2, 263, 700. 00 were realised as total revenue from gum arabic and the other <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> respectively. This gave gross margins/kg of 27. 65 and N 18. 87 respectively for gum arabic and the other <b>tree</b> <b>crops.</b> Their marketing efficiencies (ME) calculated were 57. 87 % and 48. 80 % respectively for gum arabic and the other <b>tree</b> <b>crops.</b> This implies that gum arabic was more profitable than the other <b>tree</b> <b>crops,</b> hence promoting gum arabic production will aids in poverty alleviation in the study area...|$|R

40|$|The tropics {{produce a}} range of fruit from <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> that cannot be grown in colder climates. Bananas, mangos, several nuts, spices, coffee, and cacao are widely traded and much sought after around the world. However, the {{sustainable}} production of these tropical <b>tree</b> fruit <b>crops</b> faces significant challenges. Among these, losses due to pests and diseases play a large part in reducing yields, quality, and profitability. Using bananas and cacao as key examples, we outline {{some of the reasons}} fungal and oomycete diseases cause such significant losses to tropical <b>tree</b> <b>crops.</b> Cultivation of monocultures derived from limited genetic diversity, environmental conditions conducive for disease development, high levels of disease incidence and severity, a lack of disease resistance in planting materials, shortages of labor, and inadequate infrastructure and investment pose significant challenges, especially for smallholder producers. The expansion of travel and trade has given rise to emerging infectious plant diseases that add further insecurity and pressure. We conclude that holistic actions are needed on multiple fronts to address the growing problem of disease in tropical fruit <b>tree</b> <b>crops...</b>|$|R
