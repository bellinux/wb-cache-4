The figure <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the camera, now steady, again briefly, then back to its hand. After a series of jump cuts in which they turn rapidly {{back and forth between the}} two positions, the figure looks directly at the camera and points to it.|$|E
5|$|Azar and {{a healer}} provide {{alternative}} treatment for Waterston, who fully recovers. He announces {{that he still}} wants a relationship with Scully, but she realizes {{she is no longer}} the same person she was those many years ago and rejects him. As she sits outside the hospital on a bench, Scully thinks that she sees the mysterious woman again, but {{it turns out to be}} Mulder. Later, the two agents sit in Mulder's apartment talking about the events of the last few days. Mulder begins to speak more existentially about what transpired, implying that fate has brought them together but, when he <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Scully, he sees that she has fallen asleep.|$|E

Sim贸n tells Laura that his wish was for her to stay {{and take care of}} the orphans, she then happily tells them a story. Sometime later, Carlos visits a memorial to Laura, Sim贸n and the orphans. Carlos returns to the orphans' old bedroom and finds a medallion that he had given to Laura. He <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> as the door opens, and he smiles.|$|E

6000|$|He went on grumbling as he walked. I {{followed}} him. Halfway {{across the}} field we met {{the owner of the}} voice. She was a pleasant-looking lass, not exactly pretty--not the sort of girl one <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at in a crowd--yet, having seen her, it was agreeable to continue looking at her. St. Leonard introduced me to her as his eldest daughter, Janie, and explained to her that behind the study door, if only she would take the trouble to look, she would find a time-table - ...|$|E
6000|$|CHRIS--[Hurriedly.] Ay go up bow. All hands asleep 'cepting fallar on vatch. Ay gat heave line to dat fallar. [He {{picks up}} a coil of rope and hurries off toward the bow. ANNA walks back toward the extreme stern {{as if she wanted}} to remain as much {{isolated}} possible. She turns her back on the proceedings and stares out into the fog. THE VOICE is heard again shouting [...] "Ahoy" [...] and CHRIS answering [...] "Dis way" [...] Then there is a pause--the murmur of excited voices--then the scuffling of feet. CHRIS appears from around the cabin to port. He is supporting the limp form of a man dressed in dungarees, holding one of the man's arms around his neck. The deckhand, JOHNSON, a young, blond Swede, follows him, helping along another exhausted man similar fashion. ANNA <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at them. Chris stops for a second--volubly.] Anna! You come help, vill you? You find vhiskey in cabin. Dese fallars need drink for fix dem. Dey vas near dead.|$|E
60|$|After {{proceeding}} {{a mile or}} so, {{taking two}} or three <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for improvement, I began to perceive evident signs {{on the part of}} the road of retrograding into lane-ism; the county had evidently deserted it, and though made for cars and coaches, its traffic appeared to be now confined to donkeys carrying turf home from the bog, in double kishes on their back. Presently the fragments of a bridge presented themselves, but they too were utterly fallen away from their palmy days, and in their present state afforded but indifferent stepping-stones over a bog stream which ran, or rather crept, across the road. These, however, I luckily traversed, and was rewarded by finding a broken down entrance to a kind of wood on the right hand. In Ireland, particularly in the poorer parts--to rank among which, County Leitrim has a right which will not be disputed--a few trees together are always the recognised sign of a demesne, of a gentleman's seat, or the place where a gentleman's seat has been; and I directly knew that this must be a demesne. But ah! how impoverished, if one might judge from outward appearances. Two brick pillars, from which the outside plaster had peeled off and the coping fallen, gave evidence of former gates; the space was closed up with a loose built wall, but on the outer side of each post was a little well worn footpath, made of soft bog mould. I of course could not resist such temptation, and entered the demesne. The road was nearly covered with that short dry grass which stones seem to throw up, when no longer polished by the wealthier portion of man or brute kind.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you," [...] she said. [...] "It {{has nothing to}} do with the case, but since you ask, you shall know. There is a dear little girl in our company--Fluffy Dean we all call her--only {{eighteen}} years old. We all love her, she is so sweet, and just like I was when I first went on the stage, only much nicer. She is very pretty, she has no money, and she is such an affectionate little dear that although she is as good as gold, we are all terrified for her sake whenever she makes acquaintances. Several of us who are most interested made a sort of covenant. We all took it in <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after her, and try to see that she did not meet any one she shouldn't. Yet, for all our precautions, Austen Abbott got hold of her and turned her silly little head. He was a man of experience, and she was only a child. She wouldn't listen to us--she wouldn't hear a word against him. I took what seemed to me to be the only chance. I went to him myself--I begged for mercy, I begged him to spare the child. I swore that if--anything happened to her, I would start a crusade against him, I would pledge my word that he should be cut by every decent man and woman on the stage! He listened to what I had to say and at first he only smiled. When I had finished, he made me an offer. He said that if I would sup with him alone at the Milan, and permit him to escort me home afterwards, he would spare the child. One further condition he made--that I was to tell no one why I did it. It was the man's brutal vanity! I made the promise, but I break it now. You have asked me and I have told you. I went through with the supper, although I hated it. I let him come in for a drink as though he had been a friend. Then he tried to make love to me. I took the opportunity of telling him exactly what I thought of him. Then I showed him the door, and left him. Afterwards--afterwards--Brian came in! They must have met upon the very threshold!" ...|$|E

50|$|The {{camera is}} usually {{stationary}} throughout the film, but {{this trend is}} sometimes contrasted by abrupt, rapid movements of the camera.
