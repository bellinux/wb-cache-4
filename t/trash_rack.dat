40|$|Small {{hydropower}} plants (SHP) are {{technical facilities}} {{that are part}} of alternative energy sources [Paish 2002]. They are primarily characterised by low unit power (in Poland below 5 MW) and are often constructed on existing barrages. Electrical current produced by these plants is used to meet local demand. Considering the exploitation of SHPs, it is important to ensure a stable flow through turbines. Aggidis et al. [2010] analysed SHP equipment costs depending on the turbine set. The turbines are protected against damage with <b>trash</b> <b>racks</b> applied for capturing water-borne detritus, such as plant debris carried by water. However, <b>trash</b> <b>racks</b> as solid equipment of SHPs cause head losses, and as a consequence reduce the efficiency of the system. These losses result not only from the spacing of bars, their shape and the technical condition of the inlet chamber, but also from plant debris, its nature, and the quantity of accumulated material that effectively limits the flow. The plant debris captured on <b>trash</b> <b>racks</b> is characterised by diversity in terms of species composition related to the vegetation period and the area where hydraulic facilities are located. Therefore, it is important to maintain <b>trash</b> <b>racks</b> clean by regular removal of the accumulated material. In this context, modernised and newly built power plants are fitted with mechanical cleaners. In older facilities, manual intervention for regular cleaning is required. The present study analyses how the bar shape and the orientation angle of <b>trash</b> <b>racks</b> as well as the accumulated plant debris affect head losses. The results were obtained from laboratory tests. The research examined the impact the inclination angle of <b>trash</b> <b>racks</b> (30 °, 60 ° and 80 °) has on head loss values for three different shapes of bars (cylindrical, angled and flat rectangular) and various weight portions of plant debris (0. 25, 0. 375 and 0. 5 kg). The summarised losses were determined by measuring the difference in water levels in front and behind the bars using laboratory facilities. The individual components of losses were determined based on empirical relationships, excluding the losses occurring due to plant debris. Subsequently, the loss resulting from the limited flow was calculated based on the balance of calculated and measured losses...|$|R

50|$|Trash racks {{composed}} of vertical wooden strakes separated by narrow gaps are very common and perform extremely poorly.

50|$|A <b>trash</b> <b>rack</b> is {{a wooden}} or metal structure, {{frequently}} supported by masonry, that prevents water-borne debris (such as logs, boats, animals, masses of cut waterweed, etc.) {{from entering the}} intake of a water mill, pumping station or water conveyance.

We used three-dimensional acoustic telemetry to monitor fine-scale movementof telemetered silver eels in the forebay (the first 100 m of area directly upstream ofthe dam). Eel movements were tracked approximately every three seconds, and individualswimming pathways were reconstructed to compare the three-dimensional resultswith biotelemetry methods previously used at this site; conventional telemetrysystems included radio, PIT, and acoustic telemetry. We found that three-dimensionalacoustic telemetry provided the necessary fine-scale resolution to characterize dominantmovement patterns and locations of passage. Eels were detected at all depthsthroughout the forebay; however, they spent the greatest proportion of their timenear the bottom, with occasional vertical movements to the surface.

The second step utilizes large metal louvers to cause rippling in the water, which creates a turbulence that the smaller fish avoid and swim away into bypass pipes. In the third step, the bypass pipe takes the fish through series of secondary louvers and screens which lead to a secondary channel which separates the fish into a manageable amount of water. By the fourth and final step, the fish are placed into seven 20-foot diameter concrete tanks that each hold 10 to 12 feet of water. Once the fish are in the tanks, they are identified, counted, and measured before being transported back upstream via trucks.|$|E
40|$|Frazil ice is a {{phenomenon}} {{that takes place in}} cold regions when the water of rivers, lakes or oceans is cooled under 0 ºC. Several times during winter, frazil ice can appear at river Ätran, where Träbena hydropower plant is held by the company Wetterstad Consulting AB. Frazil ice particles contained in the flowing water are extremely sticky and adhere to any object placed in the water. <b>Trash</b> <b>racks</b> are used by the power plant at the water intakes to prevent any strange object to go into the turbines. However, frazil ice particles stick to the <b>trash</b> <b>racks</b> creating an ice blockage that interrupts the water inflow. In this situation, the power plant has to stop the production even for several months, {{due to the lack of}} water that reaches the turbines. In order to solve this problem, the company has installed a heating system on the <b>trash</b> <b>racks</b> that prevent the adhesion of frazil ice particles. This system is manually operated, and it is turned on or off based on the experience and predictions of the company. This heating system is very power consuming and every time it is turned on unnecessarily the company loses money. An automatic frazil ice detection system that turns on the heating system when needed is to be created. For that, several options have been analysed, and finally a capacitor-based sensor has been developed as a solution. The sensor consist of two steel plates coated with semi-transparent polycarbonate submerged underwater parallel placed in the space between the trash racks’ bars, forming this way a parallel plate capacitor. The capacitance of a capacitor depends exclusively on its geometry and the dielectric material between the plates. Hence when the water temperature is low enough, frazil ice particles stick to the plates of the capacitor and its capacitance will vary indicating that the accretion of frazil ice may block the water inflow. This variation is registered and a signal is send to the heating system to start operating. This way, the heating system is completely automated; no human intervention is needed at all.

In order to create favorable flow diversion at the intake, manipulation of mountanious reservoirs were modelled and the economic cost related to flood spill and flow changes were calculated. Finally, an advanced computational fluid dynamics model was calibrated and applied at the intake to describe the hydraulics at different flow conditions and relate the physical variables to accurate recordings from stateof-the-art three dimensional radio tags surgically implanted in smolts.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{handling}} of debris in small hydro power intakes is assessed by evaluating the concept of back flushing with a horizontally fixed <b>trash</b> <b>rack.</b> The concept of back flushing is to reverse the flow over the <b>trash</b> <b>rack</b> {{for a short period}} of time in order to detach and evacuate clogged debris through a flushing pipe or gate. In this study the concept of back flushing with a horizontal <b>trash</b> <b>rack</b> is evaluated for two different designs; a one chamber design and a two chamber design. The one chamber design is based on H. Brekke?s conceptual idea. The two chamber design is also based on H. Brekke?s idea but it is also inspired by Bergedammen. Bergedammen is an intake designed with two chambers making it possible to continue power production while back flushing one chamber at the time. The efficiency of back flushing as well as the hydraulic performance during normal operation is mainly evaluated using numerical modelling and a CFD-software. The concept of back flushing, general intake hydraulics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is covered by the literature study in this thesis. The evaluation of the back flushing concept is initiated by a physical demonstration model with two chambers. The demonstration model is built and tested for flushing efficiency and performance during normal operation. The following numerical tests are performed on 4 different model designs. The first model illustrates a full scale one chamber design. The second model illustrates a full scale two chamber design. The third model is identical to the demonstration model. The forth model is designed as a result of the demonstration model and the previous numerical models, where important model parameters were identified. The important model parameters for effective flushing and hydraulic performance during normal operation is identified as the height of the weir, the vertical position of the <b>trash</b> <b>rack,</b> the length of the model and the amount of water available for flushing. The numerical analyses evaluate the flushing efficiency by assessing the velocity distribution over the <b>trash</b> <b>rack.</b> The hydraulic performance of the models during normal operation is evaluated by assessing streamlines, head loss and turbulent kinetic energy levels (TKE) by the outlet. During flushing the most important parameter is the height between the top of the weir and the <b>trash</b> <b>rack.</b> A high weir results in an even velocity distribution over the <b>trash</b> <b>rack.</b> A low weir results in uneven velocities with higher velocities along the weir.

40|$|To {{provide a}} better {{understanding}} of how frazil ice deposits on <b>trash</b> <b>racks</b> at water intakes, the phenomenon was video recorded at two hydropower plants and in a refrigerated laboratory flume. Initial accretion of frazil ice around a single bar and the motion of particles in the vicinity of an obstacle was simulated through numerical modelling and studied using plastic particles in a laboratory flume. Ice initially accumulates on the upstream face of the bars, and it progresses then to the upstream sides of the bars. Tha frazil ice layer grows in all directions, and it finally bridges over the spaces between bars. The ice blockage starts at the upper part of the rack and progresses downward. The head losses across each intake, which are observed continuously at the plants, illustrate the degree and importance of ice growth. Observations from laboratory experiments with a single bar in a flume, showed that frazil ice particles deposited on all bar surfaces. Separate flume tests were run with plastic particles simulating ice particles. The frequency of collision of these particles with the front face of a rectangular bar varied with the particle density and the fluid velocity. In a test with particles of various sizes, the smaller particles were more likely to enter the side wake than larger ones. A mathematical model can be used to predict patterns of ice deposition that correspond to the observed results. Such a model must include a hydrodynamic part for viscous flows and a particle trajectory model. Some models neglect the term for force due to pressure gradient in their calculations of a particle trajectory because the particles had larger density than the surrounding fluid. Ice particles have almost the same density as the water and simulated results showed that this term, caused by the pressure gradient, is the dominant force that counter the momentum of the particles when they move in the region close to the obstacle. The simulated results were affected by the particle size distribution, therefore the size distribution of frazil ice particles in a river is a factor in further studies. In tests in which no particles were allowed to deposit on the front part of the bar, in a simulation of a heated bar, lesser amounts deposited on the other parts of the bar. Knowledge of the way frazil ice accumulates on water intakes and the initial ice accretion on individual <b>trash</b> <b>racks</b> should be valuable in future work for finding methods to reduce the ice blockage and in the verification of more detailed model studies.
