5|$|The crash killed Sudan's deputy defense minister, Colonel Ibrahim Shamsul-Din, and 13 other {{high-ranking}} {{officers who}} had been touring the southern military area. 16 people survived the crash.

5|$|Psittacosaurs had {{self-sharpening}} {{teeth that}} would have been useful for cropping and slicing tough plant material. Unlike later ceratopsians, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> teeth suitable for grinding or chewing their food. Instead, they used gastroliths—stones swallowed to wear down food as it passed through the digestive system. Sometimes numbering more than fifty, these stones are occasionally found in the abdominal cavities of psittacosaurs, and may have been stored in a gizzard, as in modern birds.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle of}} Morotai began at 6:30 {{on the morning}} of 15 September. Allied {{warships}} conducted a two-hour-long bombardment of the landing area to suppress any Japanese forces there. This bombardment set several native villages on fire, but caused few Japanese casualties as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> many troops in the area.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. <b>They</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the modifications of the skull and jaw {{that allowed them to}} swallow prey on land. Prey could be caught in the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E

5|$|He {{appealed to}} the House of Lords, who decided (led by Lord Birkenhead) that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the {{jurisdiction}} to hear the appeal, since a rule of English law specifies that once a writ of habeas corpus is issued (as it was by the Court of Appeal) no superior court can overrule it. After a further attempt to keep O'Brien in custody (simply by not letting him out of prison) he was finally released on 16 May.|$|E
5|$|Hindman set to {{work and}} issued a series of harsh {{military}} edicts, instituting conscription, authorizing guerrilla warfare and requisitioning supplies {{for the defense of}} the State. Hindman also commenced a campaign of misinformation designed to mislead Federal authorities about the strength of the state's defenses. He also diverted Texas troops bound for Virginia for use in defense of Arkansas. This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to fear that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> an adequate supply line to conquer the state and soon diverted from a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid supply line.|$|E

5|$|In {{the control}} and living spaces, the ship had quieted down, too. Orders were given in low voices; the men speak to each other, {{carrying}} out their normal duties, in a repressed atmosphere. A regular pall has descended upon us. I know that all hands {{are aware of the}} decision and recognize the need for it. Perhaps they are relieved that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to make it.

5|$|In the mid-1980s, Nickelodeon was {{approached}} by production and consulting groups {{with the idea of}} doing a game show for children, a first for the network. Nickelodeon conducted focus groups and concluded that children enjoyed watching game shows with adults, but <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a game show targeted at their demographic. Dee LaDuke, Robert Mittenthal, Michael Klinghoffer, and Geoffrey Darby worked to develop a new format, basing it on a combination of trivia, truth or dare, and the board game Mouse Trap. The pilot presentation was recorded in May 1986, hosted by Darby. Double Dare was green-lighted and announced in June 1986.|$|E
5|$|Murray married Elizabeth Finch. <b>They</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{children}} and took on {{care of their}} niece, Lady Elizabeth Murray (b. 1760), after her mother died. When Mansfield's nephew Captain Sir John Lindsay returned to Britain in 1765 following the Seven Years' War and his assignment in the West Indies, he brought his natural daughter Elizabeth. Of half African descent, she was born into slavery in 1761, the daughter of Maria Bell, an enslaved woman. Lindsay asked Murray to take on her care and education, and she was baptized Dido Elizabeth Belle in 1766 in London.|$|E

5|$|Now {{with the}} city under Gorgopas' command the {{defenders}} became reinvigorated. The siege was proving more difficult until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 Roman soldiers. With {{the arrival of the}} new soldiers, the allied soldiers were encouraged and began bombarding the city again with their siege engines while the Rhodian and Pergamese fleet continued to put pressure on the Spartans from the sea. The Spartans knew that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> much of a chance of withstanding the renewed allied assault and Gorgopas decided to surrender the city to the Romans under the condition that the garrison was allowed to leave the city unharmed.|$|E
5|$|On another {{occasion}} during the war, when {{the lady in}} waiting who usually picked them up from the hospital was detained and sent a carriage without an attendant, Tatiana and her sister Olga decided to go shopping for the first time. They ordered the carriage to stop near a group of shops and went {{into one of the}} stores, where they were unrecognized because of their nurses' uniforms. They came back out without buying anything when they realized <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> money with them and wouldn't have known how to use it even if they did. The next day they asked Chebotareva how to use money.|$|E
5|$|One month later, former Wisteria Lane {{resident}} Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) {{moves back}} to the neighborhood after twelve years of absence with her husband, Adam (Nathan Fillion), and teenage daughter, Dylan (Lyndsy Fonseca). Katherine had known Susan before moving away under mysterious circumstances. Susan's daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), is puzzled to learn that Dylan has no recollection of their childhood friendship or of her life on Wisteria Lane. Later, in a cryptic conversation, Adam asks Katherine if {{they made a mistake}} in moving back, and Katherine reminds him that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a choice.|$|E

They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users.

In August 1996, the initial version of Google, still on the Stanford University website, was made available to Internet users.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{join the}} {{investigation}} at McKesson’s home. Scully suggests {{a connection between}} the burned body of Ariel McKesson who disappeared in 1956 and her mother, the latest victim. Scully believes that the burned body should be exhumed to potentially learn the connection with the other deaths. Later, the gravediggers already have the coffin excavated when Detective Abbott shows up at the town cemetery. They tell him that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to dig because somebody already dug the coffin up and scratched the lid up. While they drive off with the body, Abbott inspects a dead tree. The creature is within and it eviscerates Abbott.|$|E
