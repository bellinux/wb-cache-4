25|$|While few {{societies}} have recognized same-sex unions as marriages, {{the historical and}} anthropological record reveals a large range of attitudes towards same-sex unions ranging from praise, through full acceptance and integration, sympathetic toleration, indifference, prohibition and discrimination, to persecution and physical annihilation.

Some supporters of same-sex marriages take {{the view that the}} government should have no role in regulating personal relationships, while others argue that same-sex marriages would provide social benefits to same-sex couples.

25|$|From the beginning, Didsbury {{encouraged}} {{connections to}} educational institutions in other countries, {{with at least}} 1000 people reported to have visited during the first nine months, from Greece, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and America. Staff and students made visits to foreign countries, including Germany and Russia, with students from these countries visiting Didsbury. In the 1970s, visits to Germany, France, the Netherlands and the United States became {{a major part of}} Didsbury's courses, and these relationships were strengthened when the UK joined the European Economic Community. The Erasmus Programme, a European Union programme set up in 1987, established partner institutions across Europe, allowing staff and students to spend significant amounts of time abroad, most while studying the BEd degree from 1991 onwards. The purpose of Erasmus was to allow students to gain experience in a foreign setting, and return to the UK with knowledge and skills that would impact <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>they</b> would teach. As a result of a policy change for accommodation, visits to Finland by students with their children were made possible in 2000. In 2008, it was extended to include Bridgewater State College in the United States, and Hong Kong Institute of Education, despite not being in Europe.|$|E
25|$|More {{problems}} arise for the newlyweds when Carmel's sister, Maxine (Ella Wilder), announces {{that their parents}} can't cope with Junior and Aisha. She states that if Carmel does not take <b>the</b> <b>children,</b> <b>they</b> will be put into care. Matthew is unwilling but after Carmel's father has a stroke, Maxine brings the children to Carmel so they move in with her and Matthew. He resents them as Carmel's time is being diverted from him; finding Junior, in particular, difficult to cope with. They regularly clash, causing further animosity between Matthew and Carmel and Matthew becomes violent again, punching Carmel during an argument about Junior. She has some nasty bruises but once again a tearful Matthew convinces her to forgive him. Matthew's behaviour alternates between contrite and caring to hot-tempered and violent, for seemingly no reason. Nevertheless, Carmel loves him and stays with him as she believes she can help him combat and contain his rage but Junior soon realises why his aunt is constantly bruised and tries {{to stop the violence}} by telling people about the abuse but this only makes matters worse. Matthew becomes irrationally jealous of Carmel's friendship with Dr. David Samuels (Christopher Reich), and during a family meal, he turns violent again and attempting to protect Carmel, Junior stabs Matthew with a kitchen knife and he is rushed to hospital, where he tries to convince Carmel that he has changed. She allows him to come home and tries to get him professional help but Matthew refuses, appalled by the idea and begins smashing up the house and threatening Carmel with more violence. Finally realising that she cannot help Matthew, Carmel ends their relationship. She throws Matthew out and he leaves Walford in July 1989. The following month, Carmel's father dies, so she leaves Walford with Junior and Aisha to look after her mother. Her last appearance is in August 1989.|$|E

50|$|As {{early as}} the 2nd century AD, infant baptism had begun to gain {{acceptance}} among Christians for the spiritual purification and social initiation of infants.

500|$|After {{her book}} was published, Brodie was {{contacted}} by some Eston Hemings Jefferson descendants who recognized {{his name from}} her account.

All these Jefferson descendants learned in the 1970s of their alleged descent from Eston Hemings, Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson. Brodie wrote a follow-up article about the Jefferson-Hemings grandchildren in 1976, entitled [...] "Thomas Jefferson’s Unknown Grandchildren: A Study in Historical Silences"], published in October 1976 in American Heritage magazine.

500|$|Eagle became {{immensely popular}} {{with people of}} all ages and walks of life.

[...] Wolf Mankowitz proclaimed Dan Dare a [...] "Hero of Our Time", and the Earl of Jellicoe was reported to have read the comic in the library of Westminster Palace. [...] Lord Mountbatten supposedly placed a subscription order for his nephew, Prince Charles, and on one occasion rang Hulton to complain that the comic had not arrived; a replacement was quickly despatched.

500|$|Shelley's {{trips to}} Italy were {{a way for}} her to revisit {{memories}} of her dead husband, Percy Shelley, and <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>they</b> had buried there. Moskal argues that Shelley needed to [...] "expiate" [...] her survivor guilt and Dolan {{that she needed to}} recover from a damaging trauma. Shelley writes about this in Rambles, using the trope of a pilgrimage; she believes that travelling to Italy and revisiting the scenes of her youth will cure her of her depression, writing, [...] "Besides all that Rome itself affords of delightful [...] to the eye and imagination, I revisit it as the bourne of a pious pilgrimage. The treasures of my youth lie buried here." [...] Shelley's pilgrimage follows in the tradition of Chaucer as well as the nineteenth-century trend to visit spas for healing, and like most pilgrimage narratives, hers does not relate the journey home. For Shelley, ultimately the most helpful part of travelling and visiting spas was seeing the beautiful scenery. In Rambles, Shelley contends that interacting with picturesque scenery can heal the body. Both the 1840 and 1842 trips followed times of ill health for Shelley and she used them as a way to recover both emotionally and physically. She opens Rambles by describing her poor health and hoping that by travelling her [...] "mind will... renew the outworn and tattered garments in which it has long been clothed".|$|E
