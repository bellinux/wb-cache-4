2500|$|In August 2010 Jordison {{was voted}} the best drummer of the {{previous}} 25 years by readers of Rhythm magazine, ahead of drummers such as Mike Portnoy, Neil Peart, Phil Collins, and Dave Grohl. When asked to comment he stated [...] "I'm {{at a loss for}} words. This is beyond unbelievable. Something like <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> every day why I continue to do this." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1904, KR became {{somewhat}} {{attached to}} an attractive young {{man by the name}} of Yatsko. [...] "I sent for Yatsko and he came this morning. I easily persuaded him to be candid. It was strange for me to hear him describe the familiar characteristics: he has never felt drawn to a woman, and has been infatuated with men several times. I did not confess to him that I knew these feelings from my own personal experience. Yatsko and I talked for a long time. Before leaving he kissed my face and hands; I should not have allowed this, and should have pushed him away, however I was punished afterwards by vague feelings of shame and remorse. He told me that, ever since the first time we met, his soul has been filled with rapturous feelings towards me, which grow all the time. How <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of my own youth." [...] A few days later, KR and Yatsko met again, and a relationship developed between the two.|$|E
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of a circumstance. Just {{after we}} left Julesburg, on the Platte, I was sitting with the driver, and he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|We found Hans, {{who had not}} {{accompanied}} us, being {{a little}} shy of appearing in public just then, engaged in cleaning the rifles, and <b>this</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of something. Taking the double-barrelled gun of which I have spoken, I called Mavovo {{and handed it to}} him, saying: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> tune <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of a John Cougar type sound, {{it had a}} nice groove and “cowboy” feel to it.|$|R
5000|$|LMNO: <b>This</b> EP <b>Reminds</b> <b>Me</b> of '93 (2004), Economic Food Chain Music (2004), Leave My Name Out (re-issue) (2005), P's & Q's (2005) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Phew,' said Horse Egan, when a burial-party {{had taken}} over the burden. 'I'm {{powerful}} dhry, and <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> there'll be no more beer at all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is encouraging," [...] said he. [...] "It is my {{dread of}} the water that has {{prevented}} me from returning to Sangoa, or even visiting my yacht. And <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of a favor I wish to ask." ...|$|E
60|$|Look at {{the rapid}} {{manner in which}} the news of the Galveston {{disaster}} was made known to the entire world. <b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of an episode which occurred fifteen years ago when I was at church in Hartford, Connecticut.|$|E
5000|$|I {{recall a}} faculty party at Cornell, {{the day after}} the annual Fourth of July celebration at the {{university}} football stadium with fireworks. The wife of an economics professor, when asked if she had enjoyed the fireworks, replied, [...] "Yes, but I could have done without all the flag-waving." [...] <b>This</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of that familiar old song—familiar in some circles, at least—"If you don't like my peaches, why do you shake my tree?" ...|$|R
60|$|I suggested, {{a little}} warmly, {{that if she}} allowed her father to leave her alone at night with {{delicate}} children, she {{had no right to}} choose WHO should assist her in an emergency. It struck me afterwards that this was not very complimentary to him, and I added hastily that I wondered if she expected some young lady to be passing along the trail at midnight! But <b>this</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of Johnson's style of argument, and I stopped.|$|R
6000|$|Father Brown laughed. [...] "I am only on my holiday," [...] he said. [...] "I haven't got any theories. Only <b>this</b> place <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of fairy stories, and, if you like, I'll {{tell you}} a story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, Jack, is a lady inquiring {{after your}} health. Betts, <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> {{of the time}} Isaac came home wounded, after his escape from the Hurons. Strikes me he and his Indian bride should be about due here on a visit." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of a remark, I have {{elsewhere}} made {{respecting the}} expediency of separating the arguments addressed to, and valid for, a believer, from the proofs and vindications of Scripture intended {{to form the}} belief, or to convict the Infidel.|$|E
60|$|THE STATUE. Good. [Reflectively] All the same, the Superman {{is a fine}} conception. There is {{something}} statuesque about it. [He places himself on the grave trap beside The Devil. It begins to descend slowly. Red glow from the abyss]. Ah, <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of old times.|$|E
5000|$|The timbre of {{your voice}} on <b>this</b> tune <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of George Harrison’s sound, the tune {{as a whole}} is very Beatle inspired. Did you write it with that {{intention}} or did it just develop that way? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No trouble, I assure you, and <b>this</b> book <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of what I {{was about}} to say. Have you an hour to spare for my little niece? Her mother wants her to begin, and desired me to make the inquiry." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I’ve {{been working}} with the new {{keyboards}} and ultimately developing one sound. So, in a way, <b>this</b> record <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of the experience that I had on From the Choirgirl Hotel, where technology and keyboards and the Bösendorfer were working together in an advanced way.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of Shakespeare’s “Aroint thee, witch!” I find {{in several}} books of that age the words aloigne and eloigne—that is,—“keep your distance!” or “off with you!” Perhaps “aroint” was a {{corruption}} of “aloigne” by the vulgar. The common etymology from ronger to gnaw seems unsatisfactory.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] cried Gaston, [...] "what means this? {{is there}} a tilt towards? <b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of the good old days, ere the Prince fell ill. The lists, the galleries, the ladies, the Prince's own chair of state, too! Oh, Sir Eustace, I could tear my hair that you cannot yet use your sword arm!" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>This</b> {{reflection}} <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> {{that she}} had promised us a further exhibition of those powers and within an hour or two. Remembering this I began to regret that I had ever asked for any such manifestations, for who knew what these {{might or might not}} involve? ...|$|R
60|$|The {{relation}} of <b>this</b> last incident <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> {{of one of}} his most curious peculiarities, which I have not yet mentioned--his extraordinary fondness for pet animals.|$|R
6000|$|My casual friend, Shakings, the holder, {{happened}} to be by at the time. Touching my arm, he said, [...] "White-Jacket, <b>this</b> here <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of Sing-Sing, when a draft of fellows in darbies, came on from the State Prison at Auburn {{for a change of}} scene like, you know!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, and then--YOU know, godmother. We'll both jump up {{into the}} coach and six and go to Lizzie. <b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me,</b> godmother, {{to ask you a}} serious question. You are as wise as wise can be (having been brought up by the fairies), and you can tell me this: Is it better to have had a good thing and lost it, or never to have had it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of {{the remark}} made to myself once by a lady in {{reference}} to this same Coral Island. [...] "There is one thing, Mr Ballantyne," [...] she said, [...] "which I really {{find it hard to}} believe. You make one of your three boys dive into a clear pool, go to the bottom, and then, turning on his back, look up and wink and laugh at the other two." ...|$|E
6000|$|A great {{portion of}} this vast machinery--these {{hundreds}} of men and coaches, and thousands of mules and horses--was {{in the hands of}} Mr. Ben Holliday. All the western half of the business was in his hands. <b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of an incident of Palestine travel which is pertinent here, so I will transfer it just in the language in which I find it set down in my Holy Land note-book: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Melancholy hole <b>this,</b> Major. <b>Remind</b> <b>me</b> of Westminster Abbey in London fog, {{where your}} uncle of blessed mem'ry often take me pray {{and look at}} fusty tomb of king. S'pose we go back Gold House and see what happen. Anything better than stand about under cursed old cedar tree." ...|$|R
60|$|Thereon all {{the lower}} part of the hall went away and the little tables at which we ate were removed by servants, leaving us only wine-cups in our hands which a butler filled from time to time, mixing the wine with water. <b>This</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of something, and having asked leave, I beckoned to Bes, who still lingered near the door, and took from him that splendid, golden goblet which the Great King had given me, that by my command he had brought wrapped up in linen and hidden beneath his robe. Having undone the wrappings I bowed and offered it to the Prince Peroa.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is unimportant," [...] she said. [...] "Nobody understands them, of course, but we {{all look}} as though we did. Something about <b>this</b> woman rather <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of our hostess." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of a {{conversation}} I once over heard. [...] "How a statement so injurious to Mr. A. and so contrary to the truth, should {{have been made to}} you by Mr. B. I do not pretend to account for;--only I know of my own knowledge that B. is an inveterate liar, and has long borne malice against Mr. A.; and I can prove that he has repeatedly declared that in some way or other he would do Mr. A. a mischief." ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> {{how often}} I used {{to pass by}} the places on deck, where I remembered Mr. Jones had stood when we first visited the ship lying at the wharf; and how I tried to {{convince}} myself that it was indeed true, that he had stood there, though now the ship was so far away on the wide Atlantic Ocean, and he perhaps was walking down Wall-street, or sitting reading the newspaper in his counting room, while poor I was so differently employed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Speaking of <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> that we {{are obliged}} to import all our house-building {{ironwork}} from England. Never was such foresight required to be exercised in building houses as here. Before we begin, we have to order every column, lock, hinge, and screw that will be required. We cannot go into the next street, as in London, and get them cast at a minute's notice. Mr. L. says somebody {{will have to go}} to England very soon and superintend the selection of a large order of this kind. I only wish I may be the man.' ...|$|E
40|$|I started {{flipping}} {{through the pages of}} this book when the expression “Ab Ovo” came to my mind. Ab Ovo, the beginning, the origin, the egg. <b>This</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> that the idea of correlating the origin of each human being with an egg characterized the human beliefs of the seventeenth century until Francesco Redi, inspired by the study of Iliad, wonders why Achilles asks his mother Thetis how to conserve the lifeless body of his beloved Patroclus. How the goddess can satisfy her son’s request if the spontaneous generation of flies and butterflies from the dead body corresponds to reality? Only by covering Patroclus’ body preventing flies and butterflies from laying their eggs on a dead flesh, is the correct answer! [...] ...|$|R
