Background. Development of new {{materials}} for the systems of reflection and registration of visual signals that can work in the infrared range remains an ongoing. Industry of optics ran into a problem, when the known systems based on silicate glass do not provide the necessary width of zone of transparency, and materials based on fluoride of metals have subzero chemical firmness. Objective. The aim {{of the work is}} development of the methodology towards the synthesis and research of properties of fluoride glasses and oxyfluorides of rare-earth elements (REE) and yttrium.

40|$|Lanthanide compounds, {{specifically}} those containing europium and terbium can exhibit luminescent properties {{when combined}} with ligands that promote this characteristic. Lanthanide luminescence has proven to have an array of useful applications, {{one of which is}} the formation of luminescent powders for exposure of latent fingerprints. The aim {{of this study was to}} synthesise a novel ligand to support luminescent character in europium and <b>terbium</b> <b>compounds,</b> and then dope these compounds in to talcum powder. This resulting powder would ideally give exposure of latent fingerprints that can then be enhanced, through excitation of the luminescent compounds dispersed in the powder. A novel (Me) ₃CN(CH₂P(O) Ph₂) ₂ ligand (p=o) was synthesised, and in turn was used to synthesis a range of Ln(β‐diketonate) ₃(p=o) compounds. These compounds were assessed for potential luminescent activity, and doped into talcum powder. These powders were then appraised for their prospective use as latent fingerprint exposing agents. Through modification of a published procedure, the (Me) ₃CN(CH₂P(O) Ph₂) ₂ ligand was synthesised, and characterised by Electrospray Ionisation (ESI) Mass spectrometry, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Infra‐red (IR) spectroscopy, melting point analysis and elemental analysis. With β‐diketonate ligands acetylacetone (acac) and thenoyltrifluoroacetone (tta), lanthanide metals lanthanum, europium and terbium and the (p=o) ligands a series of novel compounds were synthesised (Ln(β‐diketonate) ₃(p=o)). These compounds were characterised by the methods listed above. Using the neutral ligands 1, 10 ‐phenanthroline (phen) and 2, 2 ‐bipyridine (bipy), a series of Eu/Tb(acac/tta) ₃(phen/bipy) compounds were synthesised and doped into talcum powder, to investigate the effects on particle and structure character of the doped talcum powders. Talcum powder was also sonicated to investigate the effect of this on particle size, along with effect on use as a fingerprinting agent. Laser diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy studies informed of a notable decrease in particle size with sonication, and an increase in specific surface area. However the effect of this process on increasing exposure of latent fingerprints was deemed too insignificant to justify the procedure. The compounds Eu/Tb(acac/tta) ₃(phen/bipy), (Eu/Tb(β‐diketonate) ₃(p=o) and [H₂NMe₂]₃[Eu/Tb(2, 6 ‐dpa) ₃]. 2 H₂O were investigated for luminescent activity. Fluorescence spectroscopy determined the dominant emission wavelengths from 254 nm and 312 nm excitation were at 510 nm and 625 nm respectively. The talcum powders, doped with the luminescent compounds were analysed for luminescent activity. Direct screening with an ultra‐violet (UV) lamp with emission wavelengths of 254 nm and 312 nm informed of the powders with the most intensely observed luminescent emissions. From these results, Eu(tta) ₃(p=o), H₂NMe₂]₃[Eu(2, 6 ‐ dpa) ₃]. 2 H₂O, Tb(acac) ₃(p=o) and H₂NMe₂]₃[Tb(2, 6 ‐dpa) ₃]. 2 H₂O were chosen as the most promising candidates for more in‐depth investigation of latent fingerprint exposure potential. Furthermore, it was determined that the novel (Me) ₃CN(CH₂P(O) Ph₂) ₂ ligand was successful as a neutral ligand for supporting luminescence. The powders were trialled by several variables, including surface, powder quantity, age of latent print, temperature, and the brush used to determine their effectiveness. Powders were compared to commercial Greenwop and Redwop fingerprint powders, as these were the most similar industrial samples in terms of use. Through trials in the laboratory and the police fingerprinting laboratory, it was determined that the doped talcum powders were inferior to the commercial “wop” samples in terms of latent print definition under UV conditions. However, the talcum powders had several useful applications, specifically the dual effect of exposing prints clearly under UV and non‐UV conditions. It was concluded the best application for the fingerprint powders was on smooth surfaces such as glass, with a gradual application of powder. Small amounts of powder gave more clarity under non‐UV print exposure, but higher quantities of powder were required to get ample luminescent intensity under UV conditions...|$|E

The europium and <b>terbium</b> containing <b>compounds</b> both exhibit luminescence of the referring trivalent lanthanide ions, giving a red luminescence for Eu 3 + {{and a green}} luminescence for Tb 3 + triggered by an efficient antenna effect of the 4, 4 '-bipyridine linkers. Mixing of different lanthanides in one MOF structure was undertaken to investigate the potential of this MOF system for colour tuning of the luminescence. Based on the gadolinium containing compound, co-doping with different amounts of europium and terbium proves successful and yields solid solutions of the formula 2 ∞[Gd 2 -x-yEuxTbyCl 6 (bipy) 3]* 2 bipy (1 – 8), 0 ≤x, y≤ 0. 5. The series of MOFs exhibits the opportunity of tuning the emission colour in-between green and red. Depending on the atomic ratio Gd:Eu:Tb, the yellow region was covered {{for the first time}} for an oxygen/carboxylate-free MOF system. In addition to a ligand to metal energy transfer (LMET) from the lowest ligand-centered triplet state of 4, 4 '-bipyridine, a metal to metal energy transfer (MMET) between 4 f-levels from Tb 3 + to Eu 3 + is as well vital for the emission colour. However, no involvement of Gd 3 + in energy transfers is observed rendering it a suitable host lattice ion and connectivity centre for diluting the other two rare earth ions in the solid state. The materials retain their luminescence during activation of the MOFs for microporosity. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} synthesis and characterization {{of a number}} of extended framework materials. Firstly, a series of transition metal and lanthanide metal-organic framework materials (MOFs) possessing both two and three-dimensional (2 -D/ 3 -D) structures as a result of linkage with different rigid carboxylate ligands have been synthesized. The crystal structures have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction, and their thermal/ structural stability evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis, powder neutron diffraction, in-situ and combined synchrotron powder X-ray and Raman spectroscopy. The structural stability strongly relates to the dimensionality and chemical bonding within the frameworks. In this dissertation, a geometric strategy has been proposed to elucidate these complex structures. A nanoporous structure stable up to 500 oC can be obtained by dehydrating holmium MOF with 1, 3, 5 -Benzene tricarboxylic acid (H 3 BTC) ligand. Its porosity is shown to be 879. 1 m 2 /g specific surface area by gas isotherm experiments and absorbing 1. 46 wt% excess of hydrogen at 77 K. High resolution neutron powder diffraction has been performed on the dehydrated Ho-MOF-BTC system with P 4122 chiral space group under different deuterium gas pressures and a new mechanism for gas adsorption in framework materials. A unique "helical" deuterium adsorption phenomenon results from direct interaction between the guest molecules and the non-centrosymmetric (chiral) framework architecture. Reconstruction of the nuclear scattering density using the charge flipping method has been utilized as a novel strategy for the qualitative analysis of the adsorbed molecules, in combination with maximum entropy method (MEM) density maps that provide quantitative information of the exact distribution of the diffusion pathways. In addition, the structure, magnetic and photo-luminescent properties of three lanthanide- and transition metal MOFs with shorter formate ligand are investigated by single crystal X-ray and neutron diffraction as well as solid-state fluorescence spectroscopy techniques, demonstrating unusual magnetic behaviors of Co-formate systems and strongly characteristic emission spectra from europium (Eu(III)) and <b>terbium</b> (Tb(III)) <b>compounds...</b>|$|R

Developing methodologies that can efficiently detect PXR ligands will be clinically beneficial to avoid potential drug–drug interactions. To facilitate the identification of PXR ligands, a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay was miniaturized to a 1, 536 -well microtiter plate format to employ quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS).
