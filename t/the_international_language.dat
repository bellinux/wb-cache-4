His first stay in Europe, between April 1, 1778, and June 17, 1779, was otherwise unremarkable, and {{he returned to his}} home in Braintree in early August 1779.

25|$|The preparatory {{teaching}} {{conducted by}} Institute of Pedagogic Cybernetics at the University of Paderborn in Germany prepares {{students to become}} aware of the essential characteristics of languages, using <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>language</b> Esperanto as a model, a language with a clear and simple structure, almost completely regular and, thanks to its agglutinative character, detachable into combinable morphological elements; this model is easy to assimilate and develops aptitude for the study of other languages.|$|E
25|$|When East Asian {{names are}} transliterated into the Latin alphabet, some people prefer to {{convert them to}} the Western order, while others leave them in the Eastern order but write the family name in capital letters. To avoid confusion, some always write a family name in capital letters, {{especially}} when writing for an international audience. This habit is commonly used in <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>language</b> Esperanto. In Hungarian, the Eastern order of Japanese names is officially kept and Hungarian transliteration is used (e.g. Mijazaki Hajao), but Western name order is also sometimes used with English transliteration (e.g. Hayao Miyazaki).|$|E

25|$|Pearson {{bought the}} paper in 1957. Over the years the paper grew in size, {{readership}} and breadth of coverage. It established correspondents in cities around the world, reflecting early moves {{in the world economy}} towards globalisation. As cross-border trade and capital flows increased during the 1970s, the FT began international expansion, facilitated by developments in technology and the growing acceptance of English as <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>language</b> of business. On 1 January 1979 the first FT (Continental Europe edition) was printed outside the UK, in Frankfurt. Since then, with increased international coverage, the FT has become a global newspaper, printed in 22 locations with five international editions to serve the UK, continental Europe, the U.S., Asia and the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|After the Great War, {{there was}} a {{proposal}} for the League of Nations to accept Esperanto as their working language, following a report by Nitobe Inazō, an official delegate of League of Nations during the 13th World Congress of Esperanto in Prague. Ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against, the French delegate, Gabriel Hanotaux. Hanotaux did not like how the French language was losing its position as <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>language</b> and saw Esperanto as a threat, effectively wielding his veto power to block the decision. However, two years later, the League recommended that its member states include Esperanto in their educational curricula. For this reason, many people see the 1920s as {{the heyday of the}} Esperanto movement. Anarchism as a political movement was very supportive during this time of anationalism {{as well as of the}} Esperanto language.|$|E

25|$|Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has {{invented the}} Esperanto language. It {{has all the}} {{potential}} qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice {{on the part of}} its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and {{become a part of the}} curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>language.</b> Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore I hope that you will make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.|$|E
500|$|The Congress of Berlin {{was held}} in June and July 1878, the central {{relationship}} in it that between Disraeli and Bismarck. [...] In later years, the German chancellor would show visitors to his office three pictures on the wall: [...] "the portrait of my Sovereign, there on the right that of my wife, and on the left, there, that of Lord Beaconsfield". Disraeli caused an uproar in the congress by making his opening address in English, rather than in French, hitherto accepted as <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>language</b> of diplomacy. By one account, the British ambassador in Berlin, Lord Odo Russell, hoping to spare the delegates Disraeli's awful French accent, told Disraeli that the congress was hoping to hear a speech in the English tongue by one of its masters.|$|E
500|$|In September 1926, Jack L. Warner, head of Warner Bros., {{was quoted}} {{to the effect}} that talking {{pictures}} would never be viable: [...] "They fail to take into account <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>language</b> of the silent pictures, and the unconscious share of each onlooker in creating the play, the action, the plot, and the imagined dialogue for himself." [...] Much to his company's benefit, he would be proven very wrong—between the 1927–28 and 1928–29 fiscal years, Warners' profits surged from $2 million to $14 million. Sound film, in fact, was a clear boon to all the major players in the industry. During that same twelve-month span, Paramount's profits rose by $7 million, Fox's by $3.5 million, and Loew's/MGM's by $3 million. RKO, which hadn't even existed in September 1928 and whose parent production company, FBO, was in the Hollywood minor leagues, by the end of 1929 was established as one of America's leading entertainment businesses. Fueling the boom was the emergence of an important new cinematic genre made possible by sound: the musical. Over sixty Hollywood musicals were released in 1929, and more than eighty the following year.|$|E
