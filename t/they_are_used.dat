5|$|Applications of {{matrices}} {{are found}} in most scientific fields. In every branch of physics, including classical mechanics, optics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and quantum electrodynamics, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to study physical phenomena, such as the motion of rigid bodies. In computer graphics, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to manipulate 3D models and project them onto a 2-dimensional screen. In probability theory and statistics, stochastic matrices are used to describe sets of probabilities; for instance, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> within the PageRank algorithm that ranks the pages in a Google search. Matrix calculus generalizes classical analytical notions such as derivatives and exponentials to higher dimensions. Matrices are used in economics to describe systems of economic relationships.|$|E

5|$|Liquid sugars {{are strong}} syrups {{consisting}} of 67% granulated sugar dissolved in water. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> {{in the food}} processing {{of a wide range}} of products including beverages, hard candy, ice cream, and jams.|$|E
5|$|Milled sugars (known as confectioner's {{sugar and}} {{powdered}} sugar) are {{ground to a}} fine powder. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> as powdered sugar (also known as icing sugar or confectionary sugar), for dusting foods and in baking and confectionery.|$|E

As with the units of measure in Tables 6 and 7, these have been catalogued by the CIPM in the SI Brochure to ensure consistent usage, but with the recommendation that authors who use them should define them wherever <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>used.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} aspect {{of all of these}} examples of noise in European keyboard and string music before the 19th century is that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> as sound effects in programme music. Sounds that would likely cause offense in other musical contexts are made acceptable by their illustrative function. Over time, their evocative effect was weakened as {{at the same time they}} became incorporated more generally into abstract musical contexts.|$|E

5000|$|The {{usability}} of a system, {{as defined}} by the ISO standard ISO 9241 Part 11, can be measured only by taking into account the context of use of the systemâ€”i.e., who <b>is</b> <b>using</b> the system, what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> it for, and the environment in which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> it.

5|$|Ballas and {{carbonado}} diamond are exceptional, as {{they are}} polycrystalline and therefore much tougher than single-crystal diamond; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> for deep-drilling bits and other demanding industrial applications. Particular faceting shapes of diamonds {{are more prone to}} breakage and thus may be uninsurable by reputable insurance companies. The brilliant cut of gemstones is designed specifically to reduce the likelihood of breakage or splintering.|$|E
