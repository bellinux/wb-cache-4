50|$|When all {{the records}} are assembled, the {{surveyor}} examines the documents for errors, such as closure errors. When a {{metes and bounds}} description is involved, the seniority of the deeds must be determined. The title abstract usually gives the order of seniority for the deeds related to the tract being surveyed and should be used if available. After this data is gathered and analyzed the field survey may commence. The initial survey operations should be concentrated on locating monuments. In urban regions, monuments should be sought initially; but {{in the absence of}} monuments, property corners marked by iron pins, metal survey markers, iron pipes, and other features possibly establishing a line of possession should be located. When the approximate positions for the boundaries of the property have been located, a traverse is run around the property. While the control traverse is being run, ties should be measured and all details relevant to the boundaries should be acquired. This includes but is not limited to locating the property corners, monuments, fences, hedge rows, walls, walks, and all buildings on the lot. The surveyor then takes this collected data and compares it to the records which were received. When a solution is reached, the chosen property corners (those that best fit all the data) are coordinated, and ties by direction and distance are computed from the nearest <b>traverse</b> <b>point.</b> Once this has been established the features on the lot can be drawn, dimensions can be shown from these features to the boundary line, and a map or plat is prepared for the client.|$|E
40|$|Capacity {{definition}} recognises {{that only}} <b>traverse</b> <b>point</b> or uniform section of roadway capacity can be estimated. Since midblock median U-turn opening is a nonuniform infrastructure, a novel capacity estimation method is needed. The paper proposes sectioning models for estimating U-turn capacity based on dynamics and regression theory. Surveyed U-turn roadway {{was divided into}} three sections (entry, middle curve, and exit). Traffic data for each section and adjoining priority traffic stream were collected continually for eight weeks. After modifying passenger car values, ensuing traffic flows and computed densities were used to develop capacity model for entry and middle curve. Regression models where traffic flows from the exit section were taken as the dependent variables and flows from the priority stream were taken as independent variable were used to model capacity for the exit section. Sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed models can produce reliable and accurate results. Results reveal that that traffic capacity at entry (1221 [*]pcu/h) and exit (about 350 [*]pcu/h) sections differs significantly. The paper concluded that U-turn roadway capacity cannot be generalized because the structure is nonuniform...|$|E

After, the study focuses on and probes, GPS observation of <b>traverse</b> <b>points</b> from the nearest referance points by kinematic methods.

40|$|To {{aid in the}} {{representative}} measurement of pollutant emissions and/or total volumetric flow rate from a stationary source, a measurement site where the effluent stream is flowing in a known direction is selected, and the cross-section of the stack is divided {{into a number of}} equal areas. A <b>traverse</b> <b>point</b> is then located within each of these equal areas. 1. 2 Applicability This method is applicable to flowing gas streams in ducts, stacks, and flues. The method cannot be used when: (1) flow is cyclonic or swirling (see Section 2. 4); (2) a stack is smaller than about 0. 30 meter (12 in.) in diameter or 0. 071 m 2 (113 in. 2) in cross-sectional area; or (3) the measurement site is less than two stack or duct diameters downstream or less than a half diameter upstream from a flow disturbance. The requirements of this method must be considered before construction of a new facility from which emissions will be measured; failure to do so may require subsequent alterations to the stack or deviation from the standard procedure. Cases involving variants are subject to approval by the Executive Officer. Any modification of this method beyond those expressly permitted shall be considered a major modification subject to the approval of the Executive Officer.

A separate company, the Crieff Junction Railway was authorised on 15 August 1853.

40|$|Currently, Global Positioning System (GPS) {{techniques}} {{are becoming a}} much larger part of the surveying industry. Many companies are now using GPS in their everyday work activities. The Real Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning {{is an integral part}} of topographic surveys, road surveying, con-structions and most civil engineering applications. Normally, RTK can be used to collect the posi-tioning data successfully and quickly. The civil and construction projects are designed in ground distances while RTK measurements are done in grid coordinate system, in which the distances between points are different from ground. The RTK measurements should be converted to ground for compatibility with the designed. In this paper, the accuracy of three alternatives for converting RTK measurements to ground was studied. These alternatives are, using scale factor, using two ground reference points and using Low Distortion Projection (LDP) surface. For the accuracy in-vestigation purpose, a <b>traverse</b> of 14 <b>points</b> elongated for a distance of about 1400 m was con-structed. Its coordinates were measured using total station, then the misclosure error was com-puted and the coordinates were adjusted.

40|$|Wireless signal {{strength}} {{is susceptible to}} the phenomena of interference, jumping, and instability, which often appear in the positioning results based on Wi-Fi field strength fingerprint database technology for indoor positioning. Therefore, a Wi-Fi and PDR (pedestrian dead reckoning) real-time fusion scheme is proposed in this paper to perform fusing calculation by adaptively determining the dynamic noise of a filtering system according to pedestrian movement (straight or turning), which can effectively restrain the jumping or accumulation phenomena of wireless positioning and the PDR error accumulation problem. Wi-Fi fingerprint matching typically requires a quite high computational burden: To reduce the computational complexity of this step, the affinity propagation clustering algorithm is adopted to cluster the fingerprint database and integrate the information of the position domain and signal domain of respective points. An experiment performed in a fourth-floor corridor at the School of Environment and Spatial Informatics, China University of Mining and Technology, shows that the <b>traverse</b> <b>points</b> of the clustered positioning system decrease by 65 %– 80 %, which greatly improves the time efficiency. In terms of positioning accuracy, the average error is 4. 09 m through the Wi-Fi positioning method. However, the positioning error {{can be reduced to}} 2. 32 m after integration of the PDR algorithm with the adaptive noise extended Kalman filter (EKF) ...|$|R
