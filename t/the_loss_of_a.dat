5|$|Al-Maʿarri's {{fundamental}} pessimism {{is expressed}} in his anti-natalist recommendation that no children should be begotten, so as to spare them the pains of life. In an elegy composed by him over <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relative, he combines his grief with observations on the ephemerality of this life: Even on al-Maʿarri's epitaph, he wanted it written that his life was a wrong done by his father and not one that was done by himself.|$|E

Uggla drowned while escaping the burning ship, and with <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second supreme commander, the rest of the Swedish fleet fled in disorder.|$|E

The class had a 25-knot (46-km/h) design speed, and they were considered the first fast battleships.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Gelimer {{remained}} blockaded by Pharas at {{the mountain}} stronghold of Medeus, {{but as the}} blockade dragged through the winter, Pharas grew impatient. He attacked the mountain stronghold, only to be beaten back with <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quarter of his men. While a success for Gelimer, it did not alter his hopeless situation {{as he and his}} followers remained tightly blockaded and began to suffer from lack of food.

Gelimer was then escorted to Carthage.|$|E
5|$|New Yorks ordeal was not over, however. Badly {{damaged by}} <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> propeller, the ship sailed to Rosyth under heavy escort for repairs on 15 October. At 01:00 the next morning, a U-boat {{launched}} three torpedoes at the damaged vessel, {{all of which}} passed ahead of her. Unlike in previous cases, sufficient evidence existed to suppose that this torpedo attack was not a false alarm—a number of officers and men aboard New York clearly saw the wakes of the torpedoes in the full moonlight, and a submarine was spotted {{in the immediate vicinity}} by a patrol shortly after the attack.|$|E

He died just months before Shane Warne revived the art of leg spin on the international stage.|$|E
