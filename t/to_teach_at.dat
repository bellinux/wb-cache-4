5|$|Henry was {{particularly}} {{supportive of the}} mendicant orders; his confessors were drawn from the Dominican Friars, and he built mendicant houses in Canterbury, Norwich, Oxford, Reading and York, helping to find valuable space for new buildings in what were already crowded towns and cities.

5|$|After {{leaving the}} University of Alabama, Applewhite moved to Houston, Texas, in 1965 <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> the University of St. Thomas.

He resigned from the University of St. Thomas in 1970, citing depression and other emotional problems. Robert Balch and David Taylor, sociologists who studied Applewhite's group, speculate that this departure was prompted by another affair between Applewhite and a student. The president of the university later recalled that he was often mentally jumbled and disorganized {{near the end of his}} employment.|$|E
