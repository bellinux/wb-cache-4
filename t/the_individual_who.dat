5|$|Crest badges {{consist of}} a crest and a motto/slogan. These {{elements}} are heraldic property and protected by law in Scotland. Crest badges may be worn by anyone; however, {{those who are not}} entitled to the heraldic elements within, wear a crest badge surrounded by a strap and buckle. Those who own the heraldic elements within, may wear a crest badge surrounded by a plain circlet. The strap and buckle represents that the wearer is a follower of <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> owns the crest and motto.|$|E
5|$|Each state's presidential electors {{gathered}} in their state's capital on February 4, 1789 {{to cast their}} votes for the president. As the election occurred prior to ratification of the Twelfth Amendment, each elector cast two votes for the presidency, though the electors {{were not allowed to}} cast both votes for the same person. Under the terms of the constitution, <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> won the most electoral votes would become president while the individual with the second-most electoral votes would become vice president. Each state's votes were sealed and delivered to Congress to be counted.|$|E
5|$|Each state's presidential electors {{gathered}} in their state's capital on February 4, 1789 {{to cast their}} votes for the president. As originally prescribed by Article II of the Constitution, each state chose a number of electors equal to its representation in Congress. Each elector then cast two votes for president, though the electors {{were not allowed to}} cast both votes for the same person, and were prohibited from casting both their ballots for persons from their own state. <b>The</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> won the most electoral votes would become president while the individual with the second-most electoral votes would become vice president. Each state's votes were sealed and delivered to Congress to be counted. Adams received 34 electoral college votes in the presidential election of 1789, finishing in second place behind George Washington, who garnered 69 votes. As a result, Washington became the nation's first president, and Adams became the its first vice president.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, in 1688, in {{response}} to counterfeiting and {{to raise money to}} support the Nine Years' War, Castaing proposed a method of reshaping and restriking existing coins, which was ultimately accepted. Castaing's edge lettering machine was used on the overstruck coins, and the Royal Mint supervisor Martin Masselin, <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> undertook the process, was obligated to pay Castaing for its use. In 1691, Masselin was dismissed, as he and his clerks were found to have stolen from the Mint during the reformation of the coinage, and Castaing was appointed to perform the edge lettering and restriking in his place. A second reform took place in 1693. Castaing was imprisoned in 1700 on charges of using inaccurate scales to weigh the coins to be reminted; according to his wife, Marie Hippolyte Castaing (née Bosch), the allegations were false, originating from opponents who lost money {{as a result of his}} machine's introduction to the French Mint and the resulting monetary reforms.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{the giving}} of praise by teachers, praise is a {{reinforcer}} for students. Adolescents undergo social-emotional development {{such that they}} seek rapport with peers. Thus, teacher praise is not as powerful for students who see teachers as authority figures. They give no value to praise provided by adults, or they have no respect for <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> is giving praise.|$|E

25|$|Publishing is the {{dissemination}} of literature, music, or information—the activity of making information available to the general public. In some cases, authors may be their own publishers, meaning originators and developers of content also provide media to deliver and display the content for the same.

40|$|Objectives: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} retro-spectively to evaluate the services offered at the Premarital Counseling Center (PCC) and the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> obtained counseling at the center in Kayseri. Methods: A retrospective review is {{based on data from}} the Premarital Counseling Center (PCC) in Kayseri. Seven hundred fifty four (754) <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> attended <b>the</b> Center were included in the study sample. Data were collected from the Center’s records. Records of all people were reviewed by the researchers. Differences in proportions were analyzed by Chi square test and t test. Results: The age-average of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> consulted <b>the</b> PCC was 26. 2 ± 8. 3, 91. 1 % of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> had Rh (+), 99. 5 % of them had VDRL (-), 3. 9 % had Hbs Ag (+), 0. 8 % had HCV (+) while none of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> was HIV (+) affected. It’s shown that 90. 6 % of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> were between <b>the</b> ages of 15 - 19 were women, 9. 4 % of them were men. The difference between the age and the gender of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> came to <b>the</b> center was considered significant.

25|$|According to an {{internal}} police report leaked in 2007, Fantino, as superintendent of detectives in 1991, had ordered a wiretap of lawyer Peter Maloney a police critic and friend of Susan Eng, chair of the Toronto Police Services Board, the body overseeing the Toronto Police service. Conversations between Maloney and Eng were illegally recorded despite a court order that only the first minute of Maloney's conversations were to be monitored so as to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> {{he was talking to}} was on the list of those being investigated.|$|E
25|$|Appointment of {{a prayer}} leader is {{considered}} desirable, {{but not always}} obligatory. The permanent prayer leader (imam) must be a free honest individual and is authoritative in religious matters. In mosques constructed and maintained by the government, the prayer leader is appointed by the ruler; in private mosques, however, appointment is made {{by members of the}} congregation through majority voting. According to the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence, <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> built the mosque has a stronger claim to the title of imam, but this view is not shared by the other schools.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} Shower series from 1965, {{a man is}} depicted standing under a shower but with no water. Kabakov interpreted the work as a simple but universal metaphor about <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> is always waiting for something, but never receives anything. Instead, the Italians and critics of communism interpreted the work as signifying Soviet culture and its lack of material reward. The publicity Kabakov received prevented him from getting work as an illustrator for four years, forcing him to work under someone else’s name. The use of an alter ego would become a common tool in Kabakov’s unofficial artwork.|$|E

25|$|The Nyaya school, {{one of six}} {{orthodox}} {{schools of}} Hindu philosophy, states {{that one of the}} proofs of the existence of God is karma; It is seen that some people in this world are happy, some are in misery. Some are rich and some poor. The Naiyanikas explain this by the concept of karma and reincarnation. The fruit of an individual's actions does not always lie within the reach of <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> is the agent; there ought to be, therefore, a dispenser of the fruits of actions, and this supreme dispenser is God. This belief of Nyaya, accordingly, is {{the same as that of}} Vedanta.|$|E
25|$|A six or six-day is a track cycling {{race that}} lasts six days. Six-day races started in Britain, spread to many {{regions of the}} world, were brought to their modern style in the United States and are now mainly a European event. Initially, {{individuals}} competed alone, the winner being <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> completed the most laps. However, the format was changed to allow teams (usually of two riders each), one rider racing while the other rested. The 24-hours a day regime has also been relaxed, so that most six-day races involve six nights of racing, typically from 6pm to 2am, on indoor tracks (velodromes).|$|E
25|$|Although {{subject to}} intense {{cross-examination}} by defense attorney Neil Fink {{as to the}} credibility of her testimony, Goshe remained insistent in her identification of John Norman Collins as being <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> had waited for Karen Sue Beineman {{to return to his}} motorcycle. In an effort to discredit Goshe's testimony, Fink diverted questioning as to the model of motorcycle she had seen outside her shop, to which Goshe conceded her initial belief as to the model being a Honda 350 was inaccurate. In response to questions as to her personal character, Goshe further conceded she had previously lied under oath on two occasions (one instance of which was unrelated to the trial).|$|E

25|$|By {{comparing}} {{the parts of}} the genome that are not under natural selection and which therefore accumulate mutations at a fairly steady rate, it is possible to reconstruct a genetic tree incorporating the entire human species since the last shared ancestor. Each time a certain mutation (SNP) appears in an individual and is passed on to his or her descendants, a haplogroup is formed including all of the descendants of <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> will also carry that mutation. By comparing mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited only from the mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in all modern humans, the so-called mitochondrial Eve, must have lived around 90,000 to 200,000 years ago.|$|E
25|$|Volunteering has {{the ability}} {{to improve the quality of}} life and health of those who donate their time and {{research}} has found that older adults will benefit the most from volunteering. Physical and mental ailments plaguing older adults can be healed through the simple act of helping others; however, one must be performing the good deed from a selfless nature. There are barriers that can prevent older adults from participating in volunteer work, such as socio-economic status, opinions held by others, and even current health issues. However, these barriers can be overcome so that if one would like to be involved in volunteer work they can do so. Volunteering improves not only the communities in which one serves, but also the life of <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> is providing help to the community.|$|E
25|$|However, memory scepticism {{has been}} criticized as being {{applicable}} to public language, also. If one person can misremember, {{it is entirely possible}} that several people can misremember. So memory scepticism could be applied with equal effect to ostensive definitions given in a public language. For example, Jim and Jenny might one day decide to call some particular tree T; but the next day both misremember which tree it was they named. If they were depending entirely on their memory, and had not written down the location of the tree, or told anyone else, then they would appear to be with the same difficulties as <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> defined S ostensively. And so, if this is the case, the argument presented against private language would apply equally to public language.|$|E
