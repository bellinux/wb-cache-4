5|$|As {{a proven}} Test player {{and the senior}} spin bowler, Ring was chosen for his second tour of England in 1953, this time under the {{captaincy}} of Hassett. It proved not much happier than his 1948 experience, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> less strong side his eventual wicket tally, 68 first-class wickets {{at an average of}} 19.89, placed him third among the regular bowlers.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. Mary Patterson, of Swampscott, {{fell upon}} the ice near {{the corner of}} Market and Oxford streets, on Thursday evening, and was {{severely}} injured. She was taken up in an insensible condition and carried into the residence of S. M. Bubier, Esq., near by, where she was kindly cared for during the night. Dr. Cushing, who was called, found her injuries to be internal, and of a severe nature, inducing spasms and internal suffering. She was removed to her home in Swampscott yesterday afternoon, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very critical condition.|$|E
5|$|The {{second session}} saw the Mercedes drivers doing only one timed run, which proved {{sufficient}} to proceed, while the Red Bull and Toro Rosso cars were split up, with Daniil Kvyat and rookie Max Verstappen failing {{to make it}} through. Also eliminated were both Force India drivers and the second Sauber of Felipe Nasr, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> respectable eleventh place on the grid.|$|E

5|$|Before {{returning}} {{to play for}} Somerset, Mitchell-Innes once again featured for the Gentlemen at Lord's, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low-scoring match, he was dismissed for less than 20 runs in each innings. In six matches for Somerset in July and August, Mitchell-Innes scored 499 runs, and his average of 55.44 was the county's best that season. He scored 182, his best score for Somerset, in a County Championship match against Worcestershire, and followed it up with another century in the next match, against Lancashire. In all, 1936 was statistically Mitchell-Innes' best season; he scored 1,438 runs {{at an average of}} 44.93.|$|E
5|$|Insects have {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} exoskeletons, the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin. The {{segments of the}} body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or tagmata: a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head supports a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and, if present, one to three simple eyes (or ocelli) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has six segmented legs—one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax—and, none, two or four wings. The abdomen consists of eleven segments, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few species of insects, these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive internal structures. Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{of females}} in {{southern}} Texas revealed that ovaries are developed by {{two years of}} age and the first birth takes place typically a year later, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few cases females as young as one-and-a-half years may mate successfully. Females can breed again around a year after parturition. Males in the same location were found to have active testes by the age of three years, that matured considerably by the next year. Males become sexually active at four or five years. Mating may occur throughout the year, with peaks of three to four months. The time of the year when these peaks occur varies geographically. In Texas, a peak is apparent from December to March. In Bharatpur National Park (Rajasthan, India) the breeding season is from October to February, peaking in November and December. The Sariska reserve witnesses a similar peak in December and January.|$|E

5|$|Several {{residential}} squares with terraces of three-storey {{houses were}} laid out around central gardens. An example is Portland Square, which was built between 1789 and 1820, and is now largely occupied by offices. In the 1830s, much of Queen Square was rebuilt following damage caused during the Bristol Riots, and {{to the north of}} the city, Kings Square. The most fashionable areas were at the top of the hill, as in wet weather the cesspits overflowed down the hill. Further development, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> less formal manner, continued along the radial roads to Stokes Croft and Cheltenham, towards Horfield and in the St Phillips, Redcliffe and Bedminster areas.|$|E
5|$|The bovids have various {{methods of}} social {{organisation}} and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Further, these types may each {{be divided into}} territorial and nonterritorial behaviour. Small bovids such as the klipspringer, oribi, and steenbok are generally solitary and territorial. They hold small territories into which {{other members of the}} species are not allowed to enter. These antelopes form monogamous pairs. Many species such as the dik-dik use pheromone secretions from the preorbital glands and sometimes dung, as well, to mark their territories. The offspring disperse at the time of adolescence, and males need must acquire territories prior to mating. The bushbuck is the only bovid that is both solitary and not territorial. This antelope hardly displays aggression, and tends to isolate itself or form loose herds, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> favourable habitat, several bushbuck may be found quite close to one another.|$|E
5|$|The economy {{continued}} in muted form. The three main establishment families on the island, the Moodys, the Sealys, and Kempners, had essentially unrivalled {{control of the}} island. The Splash Day celebrations restarted, drawing tourists to the coast. Many hotels, banks, and some insurance companies remained as did the medical and nursing schools, {{as well as the}} hospitals. Efforts at historical preservation (notably including those of George P. Mitchell) gradually helped to re-establish the island's tourism industry, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very different form from the past. Nonbinding referenda were put forward in the 1980s regarding legalization of casinos in the city but were defeated by the voters each time, demonstrating the changes in the city since the bygone era. However informal polls in 2008 and 2010 indicate this sentiment may be changing. Indeed gambling aboard cruise ships leaving from Galveston is now commonplace.|$|E
