25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even <b>though</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E

500|$|The Spectator, however, {{criticized the}} {{relationship}} of Presley's character with his love interests: [...] "The girls in his (Michael Curtiz's) latest film, King Creole, are both played by good, serious actresses: Carolyn Jones [...]. and Dolores Hart, ... both are shown to be hungrily, desperately, unpridefully {{in love with him}} (Presley's character). They have no existence, except in him; do nothing but wait for him; hope for nothing but a little rough affection ... Instead of being kissed, they beg for kisses, which Mr. Presley sulkily and reluctantly hands out now and then, with the air of a small, fastidious boy being press to eat marshmallow and, though he feels a bit sick not quite knowing {{how to get out of}} it ... (it) really seems to suggest this is a god come down among us for a spell; and when tender and infinitely patient in spite of the long past of infidelity, nonchalance, and what looks to an observer like plain indifference from him, her lips poised for the kiss that doesn't come ... As the most extreme example of a contemporary idol, Mr. Presley is pretty fascinating, and, <b>though</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> be put off at first by his pale, puffy, bruised looking babyish face, by the weary cherubic decadence you might imagine in Nero, and the excessive greasiness of his excessively long, spiky locks, his films, however bad (and King Creole is pretty low on his list), are well worth taking a look at." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} from Entertainment Weekly, Hilary Busis notes [...] "If you {{spent the rest}} of the hour swooning, <b>though,</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> have missed out on the {{explication}} of a few crucial plot points. As its name implies, [...] "The Apprentice" [...] focused on revealing why, exactly, Rumpelstiltskin was so tickled to discover that Sorcerer's hat in the house where he and Belle honeymooned in season 4's premiere. As it turns out, the object is more than just a groovily decorated capâ€”it's also an artifact of immense power that could have enormous implications for the rest of our heroes. Well, that, or it's just another magical doohickey that seems important for a while until it disappears from the narrative without a trace. On this show, anything's possible!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The new Pro mode was {{critically}} acclaimed {{as the primary}} feature that distinguished Rock Band 3 from other music games in the field. Minkley stated that the inclusions of Pro features [...] "at once dramatically expand {{the potential of the}} game and fundamentally change the approach required to play and enjoy it". Reviewers appreciated the training modes, including their integration into the overall game's career progression and the breadth of material that is covered. Nina Shen Rastogi of Slate commented that Rock Band 3s training modes [...] helps to overcome the discouraging early period of trying to learn guitar as [...] "the gaming elements will mask the rote, homeworklike nature of the guitar training process". Kuchera noted that the modes were aimed at those who have some understanding of music theory already; [...] "If this is your first introduction to music theory, <b>though,</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> need a little more explanation", he concluded. This lament was similarly stated by Machkovech, who felt the lessons had [...] "text that was written by a musical savant" [...] that would be too confusing to those without musical backgrounds and too simple for those trained in music arts. [...] Chris Kohler of Wired described the experience he and a friend had where after playing though Devo's [...] "Whip It" [...] on Pro guitar and keyboard, they were able retain enough muscle memory to play their respective parts on real instruments, albeit not perfectly; Kohler summarized his experience that [...] "Just playing Rock Band 3 taught us a little bit of actual music".|$|E

2500|$|This creates further problems, {{as it is}} {{even more}} crucial to 'save face' after one's {{relationship}} has been broken when one is connected to new media technologies. Erving Goffman argues that all social life boils down to face-to-face interactions. These interpersonal interactions are mediated by what Goffman terms as [...] "face-work", which are the actions undertaken to maintain consistency with one's face, and to uphold the expressive order of social situations. Individuals attempt to keep a positive image of the self when interacting with others, and in order to do so, they may have to alter their appearance or manner in some way. Such face-work can also be seen in new technologies, especially social media websites such as Facebook. If someone breaks up with you, you can actively choose what [...] "face" [...] you want to present to your friends, including your ex. You can choose to either post sad updates, which is the most natural thing you would want to do, or you can [...] "save face" [...] by posting happy updates and pictures of you going out with your friends. Even <b>though</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> be absolutely heartbroken within, Facebook allows you to hide your true feelings from the online world, and from your ex, by manipulating your profile. New media is being utilized as a tool for helping users present a desirable image of themselves, enabling them to save face in difficult situations. Nearly 35% of respondents in a study admitted to using their Facebook status to make someone think that they had plans, even if they did not.|$|E
2500|$|I met Henry James {{the other}} night at Emerson's, at an Alcottian conversation, at which, however, Alcott did not talk much, being {{disturbed}} by James's opposition. [...] The latter is a hearty man enough, with whom you can differ very satisfactorily, both {{on account of his}} doctrines and his good temper. [...] He utters quasi-philanthropic dogmas in a metaphysic dress; but they are, for all practical purposes, very crude. [...] He charges society with all the crime committed, and praises the criminal for committing it. [...] But I think that all the remedies he suggests out of his headâ€”for he goes no farther, hearty as he isâ€”would leave us about where we are now. [...] For, of course, it is not by a gift of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day that he proposes to convert the criminal, but by a true sympathy with each one,â€”with him, among the rest, who lying tells the world from the gallows that he has never been treated kindly by a single mortal since he was born. [...] But it is not so easy a thing to sympathize with another, <b>though</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> have the best disposition to do it. [...] There is Dobson over the hill. [...] Have not you and I and all the world been trying to sympathize with him since he was born (as doubtless he with us), and yet we have got no further than to send him to the House of Correction once at least; and he, on the other hand, has sent us to another place several times. [...] This is the real state of things as I understand it, at least so far as James's remedies. [...] We are now, alas! exercising what charity we actually have, and new laws would not give us any more. [...] But perchance, we might make some improvements in the House of Correction. [...] You and I are Dobson; what will James do for us?.|$|E
