5|$|At Philadelphia Mutual Savings Bank, a {{group of}} men led by Agent Mitchell Loeb break in and use a machine that makes it {{possible}} to walk through the bank's wall. Several men pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and steal a safe deposit box numbered 610. One of the men is unable to make it back through however before the wall solidifies again, and he is left stuck inside the wall; Loeb shoots him in the head to prevent him from talking, and they leave.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the third act, Bart argues that modern writers like Steven Bochco, one of the creators of the television series NYPD Blue, are more talented than Shakespeare. Bochco saw the episode with his children and was so flattered that he sent The Simpsons staff some NYPD Blue merchandise. After the ghost of Homer has spoken to Bart, he leaves Bart's room by flying <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> causing slime to appear on the wall. This is a reference to Slimer, a ghost from the Ghostbusters franchise who has a similar function.|$|E

5|$|It {{was another}} 12 {{minutes before the}} {{collapse}} occurred, which enabled trains and platforms to be evacuated and incoming trains to be held back. The roof, girders and debris fell across four passenger trains, blocking all tracks. The part of the western wall that fell had crashed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and roof of the neighbouring Royal Avenue Theatre (now the Playhouse Theatre) in Northumberland Avenue, which was being reconstructed at the time. Six people died (two workmen on the roof, a W.H. Smith bookstall vendor and three workmen on the Royal Avenue Theatre site).|$|E
5|$|Tammi {{returns from}} the bank and gets back in her car. Dwight surprises her {{from the back seat}} and puts a gun to her head, and tells her to drive. Dwight comes to the {{conclusion}} that Randall killed Chase because he and Tammi were together. Dwight hands Randall a gun and tells him to shoot Tammi. Tammi tries to talk Randall out of it but Randall shoots <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> next to her and kills Dwight. Randall is eventually arrested, but Tammi successfully manages to run away.|$|E
5|$|The empty machine crashes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> into Toontown, {{where it}} is {{destroyed}} by a train. Numerous toons run in to regard Doom's remains, and Roger discovers that he inadvertently wrote his love letter for Jessica on Acme's will, which was written in invisible ink. Roger then shocks Valiant with a joy buzzer, and Valiant gives him a kiss, having regained his sense of humor. Valiant happily enters Toontown with Dolores, and Roger with Jessica, followed by the other toons.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Ruskin follows Monk {{again as}} he investigates a case at a {{pawnshop}} in which its owner was shot during a robbery. Monk is intrigued {{as to why the}} burglar entered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and only stole a small amount of money and a wristwatch. After discussing if Ruskin's presence can harm Monk, Natalie (Traylor Howard) and Monk find the crime's weapon. Monk finds the same glitter he found on Cullman's hair in the gun and argues the thief stole the watch to replace his one, deducing that the same person committed both crimes.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell of}} the object is so hard that even a boron nitride drill makes no impression, and when the attempt is made, {{vibrations}} cause severe distress in people around the object. Quatermass interviews local residents and discovers ghosts and poltergeists have been common {{in the area for}} decades. A hysterical soldier is carried out of the object, claiming to have seen a dwarf-like apparition walk <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the artefact, a description that matches a 1927 newspaper account of a ghost.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, {{one of the}} TBMs {{completed}} its tunnel at the cavern. The second TBM broke <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the cavern on July 15, 2010, completing its tunneling operation. The TBMs were partially disassembled and backed up to the 25th Street shaft, where they were lifted out. In April 2011, the MTA announced that the contract covering the tunnels, the 34th Street station mezzanine and passenger platform was 85% complete, and that the systems contract, covering mechanical and electrical systems, electric power, lighting and train tracks would be awarded by July 2011. A second entrance to the station is planned. In May 2012, the MTA announced that the extension, now 65% complete, had received {{the installation of the}} first set of rails.|$|E

60|$|He {{turned in}} {{confusion}}. There was always confusion in speech. Yet {{it must be}} spoken. Whichever way one moved, {{if one were to}} move forwards, one must break a way through. And to know, to give utterance, was to break a way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> prison as the infant in labour strives <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> womb.

5|$|Outside, Cook and JJ Jones (Ollie Barbieri) try {{to sneak}} into the girls' party. Cook enters the house through a window, but accidentally locks himself inside a wardrobe. After calling his friend, Freddie Mclair (Luke Pasqualino), for help, JJ goes into the house by himself and sees Emily and Naomi kissing. Katie, too, {{witnesses}} the pair kissing, but is interrupted when her footballer boyfriend, Danny Guillermo (Henry Garrett), and dozens of his friends arrive at the house to crash the party. Hiding {{from the rest of}} the party, Effy finds Cook, and they have sex in the wardrobe. They fall <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> into the next room and find a DVD which shows Angela having sex with her older neighbour, Martin (James Fleet). Freddie comes to take JJ home and confronts Effy about leaving Pandora for Cook. As he leaves, so does Effy.|$|E
5|$|When a {{mosquito}} carrying dengue virus bites a person, the virus enters the skin {{together with the}} mosquito's saliva. It binds to and enters white blood cells, and reproduces inside the cells while they move throughout the body. The white blood cells respond by producing a number of signaling proteins, such as cytokines and interferons, which are responsible {{for many of the}} symptoms, such as the fever, the flu-like symptoms, and the severe pains. In severe infection, the virus production inside the body is greatly increased, and many more organs (such as the liver and the bone marrow) can be affected. Fluid from the bloodstream leaks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of small blood vessels into body cavities due to capillary permeability. As a result, less blood circulates in the blood vessels, and the blood pressure becomes so low that it cannot supply sufficient blood to vital organs. Furthermore, dysfunction of the bone marrow due to infection of the stromal cells leads to reduced numbers of platelets, which are necessary for effective blood clotting; this increases the risk of bleeding, the other major complication of dengue fever.|$|E
5|$|In A Dance with Dragons (2011), after sending Sam {{away to the}} Citadel {{to become}} a Maester, Jon {{successfully}} negotiates the peaceful surrender of the remains of Mance's army. He promises to settle the wildlings in sparsely populated regions of the North, and allows {{some of them to}} join the Watch to garrison the many abandoned Night's Watch fortresses. Many members of the Watch dislike the idea of allowing their ancient enemies <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> and welcoming them into their ranks. Jon attempts to juggle the integration of the wildlings, growing unrest within the Night's Watch, and Stannis' attempts to use the Watch in his war for the Iron Throne, while trying to maintain the Watch's strict political neutrality. Already agitated by these unprecedented developments, a group of officers led by Slynt openly defies Jon's orders. When Slynt refuses to submit, Jon executes the man himself. Stannis explains to Jon his plan to attack the Dreadfort, but Jon advises him to instead rally the Mountain Clans and attack Deepwood Motte, the fortress of House Glover recently captured by the Ironborn. Stannis does so, winning the support of the Glovers and the Mormonts. Jon learns that his sister Arya is being married to Ramsay Bolton so that the Boltons may claim Winterfell. Unaware that the bride is actually Jeyne Poole, Jon sends Mance to rescue her while Stannis marches on Winterfell. Jon later receives a letter from Ramsay claiming that Stannis has been defeated and Mance is a prisoner. Ramsay demands hostages, else he will march on the Wall and kill Jon. Jon decides to seek out and kill Ramsay himself, but he is stabbed by his Night's Watch brothers seeking to uphold the Watch's neutrality before he can leave Castle Black.|$|E
