5|$|As {{the season}} progressed, however, the team quickly found its rhythm, beating ranked <b>teams</b> <b>like</b> Baylor, Notre Dame and Maryland, and {{showcasing}} a talented core of young players. Together with sophomore Katie Lou Samuelson and junior Kia Nurse, the only returning starters, the duo of sophomore Napheesa Collier and junior Gabby Williams quickly rose to national attention; even senior Saniya Chong, {{who had played}} few minutes in her first three seasons, showed great improvements, leading the nation in assists-to-turnovers ratio.|$|E
5|$|Many of the powerhouses of English {{football}} {{came from}} the North – as of the 2016–17 season, of the 119 top-flight league titles since 1888, 79 (66%) have been won by teams based north of Crewe. Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United and, since 2001, Manchester City are among the mainstays of the Premier League, while <b>teams</b> <b>like</b> Blackburn Rovers, Middlesbrough, Newcastle United and Sunderland have had more inconsistent runs in recent years, regularly being promoted and relegated from the top flight. Local teams retain staunchly loyal followings, even in the lower leagues of football – a person from Doncaster, Barnsley or Rotherham {{would be more likely}} to support Doncaster Rovers, Barnsley F.C. or Rotherham United respectively than a Premier League team.|$|E

5|$|A fee {{equivalent}} to €280,000 {{was enough to}} take him to the Ukrainian Premier League and Dynamo Kiev in January 1998, where he signed a four-year deal. Here he scored six goals in 71 league games over the two-and-a-half seasons he spent there. The Ukrainian club had been under the ownership of Hryhoriy Surkis and the late Valeriy Lobanovskyi had just been installed as manager; they would go on to win eight consecutive league titles. Kaladze also appeared in both legs of the semi-final of the 1998–99 Champions League against Bayern Munich, which Dynamo Kyiv lost 4–3 on aggregate. En route to the semi-finals, they beat <b>teams</b> <b>like</b> Real Madrid, Barcelona and Arsenal. He won eight league titles in a row during his time at both Dinamo Tbilisi and Dynamo Kyiv.|$|E
5|$|The Grey Cup is the {{championship}} of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the trophy {{awarded to the}} victorious team. The trophy is named after Albert Grey, the Governor General of Canada from 1904 until 1911. He donated the trophy to the Canadian Rugby Union in 1909 to recognize the top amateur rugby football team in Canada. By this time Canadian football had become markedly different from the rugby football from which it developed. Although it was originally intended to be awarded only to amateur <b>teams</b> (<b>like</b> the Stanley Cup), over time, the Grey Cup became {{the property of the}} Canadian Football League as it evolved into a professional football league. Amateur teams ceased competing for the Cup by 1954; since 1965, the top amateur teams, playing in Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS), have competed for the Vanier Cup.|$|E
5|$|After four seasons, Benfica proved {{ready to}} {{challenge}} for the European Cup in 1987–88. After eliminating <b>teams</b> <b>like</b> Anderlecht and Steaua București, they reached their sixth final in the competition, where they met PSV in a match played at Stuttgart's Neckarstadion, on 25 May 1988. Following a goalless draw {{at the end of}} extra-time, the match was decided by a penalty shootout. The Dutch team – fielding five Netherlands national football team players that would go on to conquer the UEFA Euro 1988 a month later – converted all of their penalty kicks, whereas António Veloso allowed goalkeeper Hans van Breukelen to defend his penalty kick, and secured Benfica's fourth consecutive European Cup final loss. Benfica did not wait long to make another appearance in the European Cup's showpiece match, as two years later – and with Swedish manager Eriksson again in charge – a team including Brazil's starting centre-backs, Ricardo Gomes and Aldair, together with midfielders Valdo and Jonas Thern, eliminated Marseille with a controversial handled goal from Vata to reach their seventh European Cup final. Before the final, Eusébio visited Béla Guttmann's grave, asking for forgiveness in hope of ending the curse. On 23 May 1990, Benfica faced title-holders Milan at Vienna's Praterstadion and were unable to prevent Frank Rijkaard to score the winning goal and give the Italian side its fourth and second consecutive European Cup title.|$|E

Gunma's only weak point is that he's scared of ghosts.|$|R
50|$|Coaching an interdependent <b>team</b> <b>like</b> a {{football}} <b>team</b> necessarily requires {{a different approach}} from coaching an independent <b>team</b> <b>like</b> a gymnastics <b>team,</b> because {{the costs and benefits}} to individual team members—and therefore the intrinsic incentives for positive team behaviors—differ markedly. An interdependent team benefits from members getting to know the other team members socially, from developing trust in each other, and from conquering artificial collective challenges (such as those offered in outdoors ropes courses). Interdependent teams respond well to collective rewards, and independent teams perform better with individual rewards.|$|R

25|$|Toronto {{was unable}} to match up with their Cup-winning teams of the 1940s and 1951 for a long time, and {{stronger}} <b>teams</b> <b>like</b> Detroit and Montreal won the Cup year after year. In fact, the Habs' 1950s dynasty closed with a last-round Maple Leaf sweep. They did not win another Stanley Cup until 1962.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, {{baseball}} {{held its}} first amateur draft, ending the system whereby wealthier and successful <b>teams</b> <b>like</b> the Yankees were able to keep their farm teams stocked with talent {{the way they had}} with Toolson, not only as insurance against player injuries but to prevent opposing teams from signing them. That ended the continuous domination of the Yankees.|$|E
