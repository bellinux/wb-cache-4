25|$|Differences in {{intelligence}} {{have long been}} a topic of debate among researchers and scholars. With {{the advent of the}} concept of g or general intelligence, many researchers have argued for no significant sex differences in g factor or general intelligence while others have argued for greater intelligence for males. <b>The</b> <b>split</b> <b>view</b> between these researchers depended on the methodology and tests they used for their claims. One study found some advantage for women in later life, while another found that male advantages on some cognitive tests are minimized when controlling for socioeconomic factors.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the task of automated mining for solutions to highly specific problems. We do so under the premise of mapping <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>view</b> on context, introduced by Brézillon and Pomerol, onto three different levels of abstraction of a problem domain. This is done to integrate the notion of activity or focus and its influence on the context into the mining for a solution. We assume that a problem’s context describes key characteristics to be decisive criteria in the mining process to mine successful solutions for it. We further detail {{on the process of}} a chain of sub problems and their foci adding up to a meta problem solution and how this can used to mine for such solutions. Through a guiding example we introduce basic steps of the solution mining process and common aspects we deem interesting to be analysed closer in upcoming research on solution mining. We further examine the possible integration of these newly established outlines for automatic solution mining for highly specific problems into a Seasalt exp, a currently developed architecture for explanation-aware extraction and case-based processing of experiences from Internet communities. We thereby gained first insights in issues occurring while trying to integrate automatic solution mining...|$|E

40|$|While several {{techniques}} {{offer more}} than one detailed view in Overview+Detail (O+D) interfaces, the optimal number of detailed views has not been investigated. But {{the answer is not}} trivial: using a single detailed view offers a larger display size but only allows a sequential exploration of the overview; using several detailed views reduces the size of each view but allows a parallel exploration of the overview. In this paper we investigate <b>the</b> benefits of <b>splitting</b> <b>the</b> detailed <b>view</b> in O+D interfaces for working with very large graphs. We implemented an O+D interface where the overview is displayed on a large screen while 1, 2 or 4 <b>split</b> <b>views</b> are displayed on a tactile tablet.

40|$|A new {{approach}} is presented for automatic registration of {{a sequence of}} 3 D scanned range images into a complete model. Provided that the user follows the proposed scanning strategy, the difficulty to register <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>views</b> into a complete model is alleviated and success rate of automatic registration is improved by an adaptive forward estimation based on the extracted rotation axes and angles of the object between each scanning steps. The basic idea of this improvement is that when each of the scan differs slightly from its previous one in a small rotation about an approximately constant axis, the rotation axes and angle in the previous scanning step {{can be used as}} the first estimation of the rotation in the next step, so as to avoid manual coarse initial alignment. Formulation of the principle is provided and experimental results demonstrated...|$|R

Initial signs of the fans' division over the band's new material occurred when [...] "The Catalyst" [...] was released as a single.

40|$|Though {{much has}} been made of Chaucer's saintly characters, {{relatively}} little has been made of Chaucer's approach to hagiography. While strictly speaking Chaucer produced only one true saint's life (the Second Nun's Tale), he was repeatedly intrigued and challenged by exemplary literature. The few studies of Chaucer's use of hagiography have tended to claim either his complete orthodoxy as hagiographer, or his outright parody of the genre. My study mediates <b>the</b> orthodoxy/parody <b>split</b> by <b>viewing</b> Chaucer as a serious, but self-conscious, hagiographer, one who experimented with the possibilities of exemplary narrative and explored the rhetorical tensions intrinsic to the genre, namely the tensions between transcendence and imminence, reverence and identification, and epideictic deliberative discourse...|$|R
40|$|Shadows play a {{key role}} in {{realistic}} 3 D graphics rendering, which dramatically enhance our perception of a 3 D scene by providing useful visual cues. Even tremendous advances in computer graphics and programmable GPUs have made real-time photo-realistic rendering a reality, the synthesis of realistic shadowing effects is still hard and computationally intensive. Shadow mapping is one of the most popular approach for real-time shadow rendering. The image-based characteristic makes shadow mapping extensively adopted in real-time applications, despite it usually suffers from the inherent aliasing errors due to the image-based nature. In this paper, we develop the Parallel-Split Shadow Maps (PSSMs) scheme, which <b>splits</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> frustum into different parts by using the planes parallel to the view plane and then generates multiple shadow maps for <b>the</b> <b>split</b> parts with variable resolutions. By applying geometry approximation to <b>the</b> <b>split</b> parts, shadow maps concentrate on the visible portions of the scene to exploit available shadow maps resolution as possible. Our approach is intuitive to develop without using complex data structures, and performs real-time or interactive shadow rendering for the dynamic, large-scale virtual environments using the graphics hardware, as shown in our experiments...|$|R
40|$|Diplomacy is {{the primary}} tool for {{solutions}} of international conflicts.

Thesis deals with this issue applied in the case study of the Russian-Ukrainian crisis. The author focuses on the role and importance of diplomacy in this conflict, its possibilities and limits in its possession {{and the ways in which}} diplomacy could prevent current tentions.

When trying to use them for large spaces, shadow maps get harder to tune and will be more prone to exhibit surface acne and aliasing. Cascaded Shadow maps (CSM) is a know approach that helps to fix the aliasing problem by providing higher resolution of the depth texture near the viewer and lower resolution far away. This is done by <b>splitting</b> <b>the</b> camera <b>view</b> frustum and creating a separate depth-map for each partition {{in an attempt to}} make the screen error constant. CSM are usually used for shadows cast by the sun over a large terrain. Capturing everything in a single shadow map would require very high and impractical resolution. Thus...|$|R

25|$|Many of {{the creatures}} are {{depicted}} in violent interaction. The central figures are a large ichthyosaur biting into the long neck of a plesiosaur. Another plesiosaur is seen trying to surprise a crocodile on the shore, and yet another is using its long neck to seize a pterosaur flying above the water. This emphasis on violent interactions in nature {{was typical of the}} Regency era. De la Beche translated Conybeare's verbal description of marine reptiles into pictorial form. Several of the ichthyosaurs are depicted seizing various fish whose scales and bones had been found in coprolites and a couple are shown excreting the faeces that will become the coprolites of the future. In addition to the vertebrates there were several invertebrates shown including belemnites depicted as squid-like and an ammonite represented as a floating creature along the lines of a paper nautilus. There are also more recognizable empty ammonite shells on the sea bottom, and some stalked crinoids (sea lilies), of which some very finely preserved fossils had been found at Lyme Regis, are depicted in the lower right corner. One of the features of the painting that has most struck historians is <b>the</b> <b>split</b> level <b>view</b> that shows action both above and {{below the surface of the}} water.

Multiple users can participate in the same browsing session, as in traditional conferencing groupware. Depending on the access privileges of the user to the different components of content on each page, WebSplitter generates a personalized partial <b>view.</b> WebSplitter further <b>splits</b> <b>the</b> partial <b>view</b> among the devices available to each user, e. g. laptop, wireless PDA, projection display, stereo speakers, orchestrating a composite presentation across the devices.

Service discovery finds and registers proxies, browsing sessions, and device capabilities.
