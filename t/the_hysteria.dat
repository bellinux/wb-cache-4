5|$|After the Court of Oyer and Terminer stopped sitting, a new Superior Court was created, and, in December 1692, Stoughton {{was elected}} by the governor's council to head the court, {{defeating}} Danforth by three votes. In early 1693, Danforth sat on Superior Court sessions conducted by Stoughton that continued to hear witchcraft cases, but without accepting spectral evidence. By this time <b>the</b> <b>hysteria</b> was dying down, and the court (sometimes with Danforth leading after Stoughton temporarily removed himself in protest at the ban on spectral evidence and other reforms imposed by Governor Phips. Danforth was sympathetic {{to the plight of}} individuals accused, relocating some of them to his lands west of Boston; Salem End Road in Framingham is part of the area where they settled.|$|E
25|$|While {{many people}} burned to death, many others {{died as a}} result of the ensuing chaos. Though most spectators were able to escape the fire, many people were caught up in <b>the</b> <b>hysteria.</b> Witnesses said some simply ran around in circles trying to find their loved ones, rather than trying to escape from the burning tent. Some escaped but ran back inside to look for family members. Others stayed in their seats until it was too late, {{assuming}} that the fire would be put out promptly.|$|E
25|$|The {{disturbances}} {{had nothing}} to do with Singapore but there was an inexorable spillover of the communal violence in Malaysia into Singapore. The 1969 riots occurred not long after the earlier communal riots in 1964. It was said that the 1964 racial disturbances in Singapore contributed towards the eventual separation of Singapore from Malaysia on 9 August 1965. <b>The</b> <b>hysteria</b> that United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) itself generated over its desire to assert Malay dominance (Ketuanan Melayu) in Singapore had its effect in heightening the suspicion between Malay and Chinese in Singapore.|$|E
50|$|The term {{psychasthenia}} {{is historically}} associated primarily {{with the work}} of Pierre Janet, who divided the neuroses into the psychasthenias and <b>the</b> <b>hysterias,</b> discarding <b>the</b> term neurasthenia since it implied a neurological theory where none existed. Whereas <b>the</b> <b>hysterias</b> involved at their source a narrowing of the field of consciousness, the psychasthenias involved at root a disturbance in the fonction du reél ('function of reality'), a kind of weakness in the ability to attend to, adjust to, and synthesise one's changing experience (cf. executive function in today's empiricist psychologies). Carl Jung later made the hysteric and the psychasthenic states the prototypes of what he described as extroverted and introverted personalities.|$|R

25|$|The band {{completed}} work on Revolver on 22 June {{and flew}} to Munich {{the following day}} to begin the tour. According to author Jonathan Gould, the Beatles would gladly have stayed in Britain rather than continue to perform in halls filled with screaming fans. The band's dedication to completing Revolver, together with their lack of touring experience since December 1965, ensured that they were under-rehearsed for the concerts. Author Philip Norman writes that the knowledge {{that they would not}} be heard above <b>the</b> <b>hysteria</b> of their fans was another factor behind the group's failure to rehearse adequately for the tour.|$|E
25|$|As news {{announcements}} {{spread and}} suspects were searched in surrounding counties, the fear crossed over {{to many other}} cities, including Hope, Lufkin and Magnolia, even going as far as Oklahoma City. Residents in other cities were also stocking up on guns and even axes. Every three weeks {{when there were no}} murders, the town's fear began to drop little by little. <b>The</b> <b>hysteria</b> lasted throughout the summer and eventually faded three months later. The Texas Rangers quietly left Texarkana little by little through October. This was not announced to keep the Phantom from attempting another attack.|$|E
25|$|From 1525, {{witchcraft}} allegations {{originating in}} a number of Pyrenean valleys on the rearguard of the Lower Navarre front and recent theatre of war (Salazar, Roncal, Burguete, etc.) were followed by the intervention of newly reformed and recent institutions, such as Spain's central tribunal Inquisition, the (Navarrese) Royal Tribunals, and the Diocesan Tribunal, who organized a series of trials for alleged witchcraft and heretical practices. In the heat of the Wars of Religion and the struggle for Navarre, persecution came to a head in <b>the</b> <b>hysteria</b> of the 1609–1611 Basque witch trials {{on both sides of the}} Spanish-French border, easing afterwards.|$|E

25|$|Danforth and Hathorne have {{returned}} to Salem to meet with Parris, and are {{surprised to learn that}} Hale has returned and is meeting with the condemned. Parris, who has lost everything to Abigail, reports that he has received death threats. He begs Danforth to postpone the executions in order to secure confessions, hoping to avoid executing some of Salem's most well-regarded citizens. Hale, blaming himself for <b>the</b> <b>hysteria,</b> has returned to counsel the condemned to falsely confess and avoid execution. He presses Danforth to pardon the remaining seven and put the entire affair behind them. Danforth refuses, stating that pardons or postponement would cast doubt on the veracity of previous confessions, not to mention the hangings.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the other}} great social traumas abetted by the war was a major {{outbreak}} of witchcraft persecutions. This violent wave of witch-hunting first erupted in the territories of Franconia {{during the time of}} the Danish intervention. The hardship and turmoil the conflict had produced among the general population enabled <b>the</b> <b>hysteria</b> to spread quickly to other parts of Germany. Residents of areas that had been devastated not only by the conflict itself, but also by the numerous crop failures, famines, and epidemics that accompanied it, were quick to attribute these calamities to supernatural causes. In this tumultuous and highly volatile environment, allegations of witchcraft against neighbors and fellow citizens flourished. The sheer volume of trials and executions during this time would mark the period as the peak of the European witch-hunting phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|On December 14, 1893, Albert Willis {{arrived in}} Honolulu aboard the USRC Corwin unannounced, {{bringing}} an anticipation of an American invasion {{to restore the}} monarchy, which {{became known as the}} Black Week. Willis was the successor to James Blount as United States Minister to Hawaii. With <b>the</b> <b>hysteria</b> of a military assault, he staged a mock invasion with the USS Adams and USS Philadelphia, directing their guns toward the capital. He also ordered rear admiral John Irwin to organize a landing operation using troops on the two American ships, which was joined by the Japanese Naniwa and the British HMS Champion. After the arrival of the Corwin, the provisional government and citizens of Hawaii were ready to rush to arms if necessary, but it was widely believed that Willis' threat of force was a bluff.|$|E

25|$|The first {{interactions}} between the colonists and the Pawtucket group occurred through trade and religious conversion. During the 1640s, Major Simon Willard traded extensively with the tribes, and in 1647 was accompanied in his expedition by the noted preacher John Eliot. Eliot returned a year later, and quickly founded a church there with a native convert named Samuel as the pastor. A dedicated church building was built in 1653, remaining until 1824, when it was demolished. Colonists began to move closer to the native tribes with the founding of Chelmsford in 1653. Subsequent grants of land extended the town to cover most of the territory Lowell now occupies, {{with the exception of}} 500 acres of farmland reserved for the Pawtucket. The colonists began actively buying land from the Pawtucket, trading those 500 acres for the island of Wickassee above the Pawtucket Falls, and <b>the</b> <b>hysteria</b> generated by King Philip's War weakened both the tribe and its relations with the colonists.|$|E
25|$|Act Four {{takes place}} {{three months later}} in the town jail, early in the morning. Tituba, sharing a cell with Sarah Good, has gone insane from all of <b>the</b> <b>hysteria,</b> hearing voices and now {{actually}} claiming to talk to Satan. Marshal Herrick, depressed at having arrested {{so many of his}} neighbors, has turned to alcoholism. Many villagers have been charged with witchcraft; most have confessed and been given lengthy prison terms and their property seized by the government; twelve have been hanged; seven more are to be hanged at sunrise for refusing to confess, including John Proctor, Rebecca Nurse and Martha Corey. Giles Corey was tortured to death by pressing as the court tried in vain to extract a plea; by holding out, Giles ensured that his sons would not be disinherited. The village has become dysfunctional with so many people in prison or dead, and with the arrival of news of rebellion against the courts in nearby Andover, whispers abound of an uprising in Salem. Abigail, fearful of the consequences, steals Parris's life savings and disappears on a ship to England with Mercy Lewis.|$|E
25|$|The Melbourne-based Epoch re-ignited {{fears of}} a Russia {{invasion}} when three Russian ships—the Afrika, Vestnik, and Platon—were sighted near Port Phillip in January 1882. Despite <b>the</b> <b>hysteria</b> generated by the media in Melbourne, no invasion ensued. David Syme, the proprietor of The Age, wrote {{in a series of}} editorials that the visit of the three ships was associated with a war that was threatening to engulf Britain and Russia, and that the squadron under the command of Avraamy Aslanbegov was in the Pacific in order to raid British commerce. Newspapers wrote that Admiral Aslanbegov behaved like a varnished barbarian due to his non-acceptance of invitations, and because he preferred to stay at the Menzies Hotel, rather than the Melbourne Club or the Australian Club. Aslanbegov was accused of spying and fraud, leading to the Admiral complaining to the Premier of Victoria Bryan O'Loghlen and threatening legal action against the newspaper. John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, defused the situation when he sent a telegraph to the government stating that relations with Russia are of a friendly character, and such newspaper reports are rendered incredible. Due to the {{fears of a}}n invasion, Fort Scratchley in Newcastle was completed by 1885.|$|E

Trials for the others continued into 1724, and 7 more were captured and tried on 7 December. This marked the effective end of the Blacks as an organised group. At the time, it was thought that the Blacks were Jacobites, with Sir Robert Walpole encouraging these ideas to advance his own interests; the rationale for the Act has been described as [...] "at least {{as much to do with}} <b>the</b> <b>hysteria</b> induced by Walpole...as with any need for new powers to fight deer-stealing".|$|E

Although many scholars reported during this period that vampires did not exist, and attributed reports to premature burial or rabies, superstitious belief continued to increase. Dom Augustine Calmet, a well-respected French theologian and scholar, put together a comprehensive treatise in 1746, which was ambiguous concerning the existence of vampires. Calmet amassed reports of vampire incidents; numerous readers, including both a critical Voltaire and supportive demonologists, interpreted the treatise as claiming that vampires existed.
