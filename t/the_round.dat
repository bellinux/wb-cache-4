5|$|Byzantine {{churches are}} not the only source of {{inspiration}} that researchers attribute to <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Church. Some scholars link its design to an Armenian influence, perhaps brought to Bulgaria by craftsmen from the Caucasus. In general, churches with such an antiquated plan in the Balkans are associated with the migration of Cappadocian, Armenian, or Georgian monks. Another possible model for <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Church in Preslav may well be found in Carolingian architecture from the time of Charlemagne, and particularly the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, western Germany, with which it shares some characteristics. At the time of <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Church's construction, Bulgaria was in direct contact with the Frankish Empire. One trait of <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Church that is claimed by scholars to be a very recognisable Carolingian influence is the presence of a monumental westwork.|$|E
5|$|More of the {{octagonal}} $50 {{pieces were}} sold than of <b>the</b> <b>round,</b> {{as the former}} proved more popular because of the association with the Gold Rush, and because people liked the dolphins. As half of the 3,000 authorized mintage for the $50 pieces were of each variety, this meant more of <b>the</b> <b>round</b> ones would be melted, leaving <b>the</b> <b>round</b> $50 with the lowest distribution of any U.S. commemorative coin, about 483—the runner up being the octagonal with about 645, though sources vary on the exact numbers distributed.|$|E

5|$|The Church of St Petka in Ruse, {{opened in}} 1944, was {{built as a}} {{reconstruction}} of <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Church in Preslav. <b>The</b> <b>Round</b> Church underwent partial restoration in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In December 2009, plans were announced to reconstruct the church in its entirety, without demolishing or altering any of the original structural remains.

Despite not being an active church, it is regularly used for baptisms and weddings.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Round</b> Church {{contains}} many medieval inscriptions, both official and scratched on its walls as graffiti. One study counted {{a total of}} 193signs and 30drawings, the vast majority bearing some kind of Christian symbolism. As a whole, the epigraphy of <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Church dates from the 10th century, and three alphabets are represented: the Greek, the Glagolitic, and the Cyrillic, {{as well as two}} languages: Byzantine Greek and Old Bulgarian (the eastern Bulgarian recension of Old Church Slavonic). The Glagolitic inscriptions of <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Church bear evidence that the use of that alphabet in Preslav continued alongside Cyrillic.|$|E

5|$|As in the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament, matches involve each player selecting two fighters to fight with. Players are able to switch their fighters out at any time, allowing the inactive character to gradually recover some life they might have lost. At certain points, an inactive character's life bar may flash, giving them a temporary boost in strength if they are tagged in. If the life bar of either of a player's fighters runs out, that player loses <b>the</b> <b>round.</b> If time runs out, the player who has the most cumulative life remaining amongst their fighters wins <b>the</b> <b>round.</b>|$|E

After <b>the</b> first <b>round,</b> <b>the</b> number of different games rapidly makes detailed analysis difficult but, in <b>the</b> early <b>rounds,</b> players generally simply adapt <b>the</b> first <b>round</b> strategy based on the boxes used.

5|$|Both Germany and the United States have {{developed}} several other rounds. These include the German DM12 multi-purpose anti-tank projectile (MPAT), {{based on the}} technology in a high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead. However, {{it has been found}} that the DM12's armor-killing abilities are limited by the lack of blast and fragmentation effects, and that <b>the</b> <b>round</b> is less valuable against lightly armored targets. The United States also has a MPAT type projectile, known as the M830. This was later developed into the M830A1, which allows the M1 Abrams to use <b>the</b> <b>round</b> against helicopters. The M1 Abrams can use the M1028 canister round, which is an anti-personnel/anti-helicopter munition, packed with over 1,000 tungsten balls. The United States Armed Forces accepted a new demolition round, called the M908 Obstacle Defeating Round, based on the M830A1 MPAT, but with the proximity fuse replaced by a hardened nose cap. The cap allows <b>the</b> <b>round</b> to impact and embed itself in concrete, then exploding inside the target and causing more damage.|$|E

In the first round Cotto had an offensive advantage and scored a knockdown on Torres. In the second round after trading hits Torres scored a knockdown on Miguel. The last seconds of <b>the</b> <b>round</b> were evenly matched with both boxers finishing <b>the</b> <b>round</b> injured.
