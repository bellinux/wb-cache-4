By the middle of 1960, the US131 was opened {{as far south as}} Martin; the section of M-118 between the new freeway and the old routing was used as a connector until the next section south to Plainwell opened the next year.

It makes things a little bit more tense, moving into <b>this</b> <b>next</b> episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Richard D'Oyly Carte, who {{was then}} {{managing}} the Royalty Theatre for Selina Dolaro, brought Gilbert and Sullivan together to write their second show, a one-act opera entitled Trial by Jury. This proved a success, and in 1876 D'Oyly Carte assembled a group of financial backers to establish the Comedy Opera Company, which was devoted to the production and promotion of family-friendly English comic opera. With this theatre company, Carte finally had the financial resources, after many failed attempts, to produce a new full-length Gilbert and Sullivan opera. <b>This</b> <b>next</b> opera was The Sorcerer, which opened in November 1877. It too was successful, running for 178performances. Sheet music from the show sold well, and street musicians played the melodies.|$|E

5|$|The highway enters Geneseo {{from the}} south, taking the name Genesee Street {{as it passes}} {{the western edge of}} the campus of SUNY Geneseo. At the edge of the campus, the route crosses the Genesee River and exits Geneseo. Past the river in the town of York, NY63 begins to curve {{northwest}} up and out of the Genesee River valley until it runs east–west once again at the hamlet of Piffard. The major junction in York is the community of Greigsville, where NY63 reconnects with NY36. <b>This</b> <b>next</b> section of highway has become a major shortcut for traffic heading to the Buffalo area, despite remaining a two-lane road through open rural country, since it is both physically shorter than going all the way to the New York State Thruway as well as toll-free. Most of this Buffalo-bound traffic follows NY36 north from Mount Morris and turns on to NY63 here. Signage along this route reflects this use.|$|E
5|$|Walter (John Noble) has {{prepared}} himself to reveal to Peter (Joshua Jackson) the truththat {{he is from}} the parallel universewhen they are called to a case. Two teenagers were found dead, evidently killed by shapeshifter agents from the parallel universe. Exploring the nearby area, they find a third unformed shapeshifter which Walter takes to the lab to study. At the same time of the teenagers' death, they find a carrier signal in the local television. With biotechnology corporation Massive Dynamic's help, they determine that the signal emanated from the parallel universe during a brief moment that the two universes were in sync, and that the next point of synchronization would occur the next afternoon. Recalling Thomas Jerome Newton's (Sebastian Roché) previous attempt to bring a building from the parallel universe into the prime, the Fringe team believes they must stop <b>this</b> <b>next</b> attempt.|$|E

500|$|Harrison found {{frustration}} in <b>this</b> <b>next</b> {{phase of the}} Bangladesh project, as the various record companies associated with the concerts' performers attempted {{to profit from the}} forthcoming release. Chief among these was the Beatles' US distributor, Capitol Records, who delayed issuing the album in the hope of negotiating a royalty rate to cover what they perceived as high distribution costs for the boxed three-record set. Harrison was resolute that Capitol should absorb the costs, just as the Beatles' Apple record label had already paid for the album's lavish packaging and full-colour booklet. All those involved with the concerts and post-production on the live album had given their services for free, in keeping with Harrison's hope that, in Tillery's words: [...] "Every penny of income – from the gate receipts to the profits from an album and a film – would go toward alleviating the suffering." ...|$|E

500|$|NeXT {{released}} a {{second generation of}} workstations in 1990. The new range included a revised NeXT Computer, renamed the NeXTcube, and the NeXTstation, nicknamed [...] "the slab," [...] which used a [...] "pizza box" [...] case form-factor. Jobs was explicit in ensuring NeXT staff {{did not use the}} latter terminology, lest the NeXT machines be compared to competing Sun workstations. The magneto-optical drive was replaced with a 2.88 MB floppy drive to offer users a way to use their floppy disks. However, individual 2.88 MB floppies were expensive and the technology did not supplant the 1.44 MB floppy. Realizing <b>this,</b> <b>NeXT</b> utilized the CD-ROM drive, which eventually became an industry standard for storage. Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and the NeXTdimension graphics processor hardware for the NeXTcube. The new computers were cheaper and faster than their predecessors, with the new Motorola 68040 processor.|$|E

Regarding the album's title change, Milian explained, [...] "the definition of elope is to run away secretly with one's beloved. <b>This</b> <b>next</b> album is about taking responsibility for yourself and making your own decisions." [...] In June 2009, The-Dream said that the album was finished. Upon completion of the album, Milian said it represented [...] "independence, not having to answer to any type of 'authority', being a woman at her best and feeling very confident".

[...] She additionally included the song on the 2009 [...] as the ninth track of the DVD/CD's first disc. During a Thanksgiving TV Special, Beyoncé aired I Am... Yours in its entirety which also featured her performance of [...] "Resentment". Nate Chinen of The New York Times said, [...] "There's exactly one human-scale moment in the concert, when she sits at the lip of the stage to sing an acoustic treatment of 'Resentment,' from her album 'B'Day.' And even then she makes it a showstopper." ...|$|E

A sequence similar to the Zapruder film, which shows the assassination of Kennedy, is shown, with Jacqueline Kennedy also appearing. Brian and Stewie next discover a universe completely depicted as a political cartoon.

500|$|In November 1934, Walker, now {{a student}} at the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, testified with Robert Olds, Claire Chennault, Donald Wilson, Harold George and Robert Webster on the {{military}} aspects of aviation before the Howell Commission on Federal Aviation. All were current or former instructors at the Air Corps Tactical School, and all except Chennault were part of the Bomber Mafia. They argued for an independent air force, in contradiction to Army doctrine. Walker told the commission: [...] "unless we create an adequate and separate Air Force, <b>this</b> <b>next</b> war 'will begin in the air and end in the mud'-in the mud and debris of the demolished industries that have brought us to our knees." [...] They were unable to persuade the commission to recommend an independent air force, although it did agree that the Air Corps should be granted greater autonomy within the Army. The commission concluded that [...] "there is ample reason to believe that aircraft have now passed far beyond their former position as useful auxiliaries... An adequate striking force for use against objectives both near and remote is a necessity for a modern army".|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} 2009 reboot's {{theatrical}} release, producers Brad Fuller and Andrew Form {{expressed an interest}} in producing another Friday the 13th film, citing the enjoyment they had working on the reboot. On October 1, 2009, Warner Bros. Pictures announced that it planned to release the Friday the 13th sequel on August 13, 2010. Subsequently, on December 10, 2009, Warner Bros. announced that it had pulled the sequel from the August 13, 2010 release slot and listed its release as [...] "TBD" [...] (to be determined). Warner Bros. also announced that Damian Shannon and Mark Swift were penning the sequel. On April 21, 2010, Fuller announced on his Twitter page that a sequel to the 2009 remake was no longer in the works, declaring it, [...] "dead — not happening". [...] In a later interview, Fuller explained that the 2009 reboot {{was the result of a}} joint effort between Paramount and New Line Cinema, as both owned portions of the Friday the 13th franchise. With a down economy, both studios were limiting the films they produced each year, opting to produce films carrying lower risks and higher rewards. Accordingly, the companies put Friday the 13th Part 2 on hold in hopes that they would move forward with <b>this</b> <b>next</b> installment when the economy bounced back. Form explained that neither studio would walk away from the sequel's production to allow the other to move forward as the primary producing house, each studio concerned that its players would look like [...] "idiots" [...] should the sequel perform well without its involvement. Form and Fuller also mentioned that the Friday the 13th sequel may be a 3‑D film, should it ever again be green-lit for production by the studios.|$|E
