25|$|In June 2002, <b>the</b> <b>Aché</b> began {{systematic}} conservation {{work on the}} Finca #470. An Aché {{resource management}} team trained by Kim Hill performed partial forest inventory and animal density counts on Finca #470 using random transect methodology. During that month <b>the</b> <b>Aché</b> management team also did two aerial overflights of the property with GPS receivers and detailed maps.|$|E
25|$|Next, in {{the early}} 1980s a dozen {{families}} from the Chupa Pou reservation left to join <b>the</b> <b>Aché</b> band that had been contacted in the Refugio Mbaracayú (Mbaracayu Biological Sanctuary) in April 1978, and was living at a German Mission for Guarani Indians. <b>The</b> <b>Aché</b> separated from the Guarani, and formed the community now called Arroyo Bandera, {{at the edge of}} the Mbaracayu Forest Reserve.|$|E

25|$|Between July 2001 {{and late}} 2003 Aché leaders {{attended}} dozens {{of meetings with}} representatives of Paraguayan government agencies (INDI, SEAM, Oficina de la Procuradora de la Nacion) and NGO's (Fundacion Moises Bertoni, World Wildlife Fund, Avina, PROSAM) interested in supporting their claim to Finca #470. All representatives of both government agencies and NGOs assured <b>the</b> <b>Aché</b> that the land would be titled to them once expropriated by the Paraguayan government. In early January 2002 <b>the</b> <b>Aché</b> received a letter of permission to occupy Finca #470 from the Secretary of the Environment, and the Kuetuvy Aché permanently settled the property on January 8, 2002.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Aché</b> {{are also}} known as the Axe people. In the past they have been called the Guaiaqui, Guayakí, Guayaki-Ache, and Guoyagui by Guaraní-speaking neighbors and by early anthropologists, however, these terms are now {{considered}} derogatory.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Aché</b> {{economy was}} {{traditionally}} centered on hunting vertebrate game with bow and arrow, extracting wild honey, and exploiting palm starch and insect larvae. Numerous fruits were also exploited seasonally, but they constitute {{only a small}} fraction of the energy in the yearly diet. In the last half century before pacification, Aché groups occasionally raided their settled neighbors for manioc root (a starchy staple), domestic animals, and metal tools.|$|E

Compared to currently approved drugs prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, THC is a considerably superior inhibitor of A aggregation, and this study provides a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism through which cannabinoid molecules may impact the progression of this debilitating disease.|$|E

25|$|Although early reports locate Aché-like groups {{throughout}} eastern Paraguay and {{the adjacent}} areas of Brazil, by the 20th century <b>the</b> <b>Aché</b> lived in four dialectally distinct groups that inhabited the Paraná River watershed {{in the modern}} day Paraguayan states of Caazapa, Guairá, Alto Paraná, Caaguazu, and Canindeyu. The Northern Aché, who are the best documented, ranged from the forests near Coronel Oviedo, to the Paraná River near Saltos de Guaira, a home range of approximately 20,000 square kilometers.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the song, Beyoncé airs out her {{feelings}} to an indifferent partner, and delivers [...] "indignation and beauty in equal measure", {{as stated by}} Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune. This view was echoed by Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine, who wrote that Beyoncé endorses [...] "beauty in honesty and, ironically, power in admitting her vulnerability", and Lewis Corner of Digital Spy, who noted that the [...] "raspy and husky growls" [...] that she adopts occasionally, show [...] "offering moments of raw, heartfelt emotion". Gleason wrote that the song writhes through <b>the</b> <b>ache</b> and the obsession that come from being the one left in love. Newman noted that in [...] "I Care", Beyoncé was [...] "spurred and left for dead" [...] by her lover but despite her best efforts, she still cares about him. She sings over cooing background vocals, and her voice moves [...] "from silken to powerful, torn to potent".|$|E
500|$|Fred Shuster of the Los Angeles Daily News {{rated the}} record {{three out of}} the four stars and complimented the {{arrangements}} which he found to be [...] "gorgeous". He felt the best tracks {{were the ones that}} Miguel co-wrote and highlighted [...] "Sol Arena y Mar" [...] and [...] "O Tú o Ninguna" [...] as standouts. The Los Angeles Times critic Ernesto Lechner gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, lamenting that it [...] "continues Latin pop's disheartening search for the glossiest production imaginable". He found the ballads to be [...] "drenched in orchestral accompaniment," [...] although he commended Manzanero's compositions. Regardless, Lechner opined that the uptempo tracks [...] "lack the sophistication that defines most pop today". Richard Torres, who wrote a more favorable review of the album for Newsday, stated that Amarte Es un Placer continues [...] Miguel's talent of infusing [...] "lushly orchestrated torch songs with genuine passion". He praised Miguel's vocals for being to able to convey the [...] "giddy rush of romance followed by <b>the</b> <b>ache</b> of love lost". He also admired the dance tunes for their musical styles and proclaimed the songs penned by Manaznero to be the best tracks.|$|E

500|$|Hayley Louise Brown of Clash {{viewed the}} song as an {{important}} part of the album, musing [...] "opening with a reworked version of heartbreaking ballad ‘Thinking About You’ and an instant confrontation with the full force of Ocean’s vocal range, the whole record echoes with extra terrestrial Odd Future synths and clumsy piano chords." [...] Lane Billings of Paste noted the song as whispy in nature, and made a case for Ocean as an R revivalist. Consequence of Sound's Harley Brown of stated that the song moves languidly, [...] "like perfect thoughts about someone missed, until the muscle memory of Ocean’s falsetto bursts into the song’s upper register." [...] She continued, [...] "while Ocean might feel this more acutely than either woman who sung those songs, there’s a reason Bey shed a tear the first time she heard it. Regardless of how much these lyrics were influenced by lines like, 'By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless,' <b>the</b> <b>ache</b> in Ocean’s voice is universal. MSN Music's Danielle Cheesman felt that Ocean did his followers a service by featuring the song as the album's opener, describing the track as" [...] the year-old spacey serenade to a boy that became a fan favorite." [...] She continued, [...] "despite now being enhanced with a strings intro, his falsetto - more importantly - remains in tact over the well-known warped ebb and flow." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Aché</b> {{are also}} {{culturally}} and biologically {{distinct from the}} neighboring Guarani. [...] Early descriptions of <b>the</b> <b>Aché</b> emphasized their white skin, light eye and hair color, beards, and Asiatic features as identifying characteristics. [...] Their subsistence practices and technology were considered extremely simple, and nomadism made them secretive and evasive.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{expulsion}} of the Jesuits in 1768, there is no further information about <b>the</b> <b>Aché</b> {{until the end of}} the 19th century and early 20th century, when several writers related the knowledge of local Paraguayan populations concerning <b>the</b> <b>Aché,</b> but none observed them directly. [...] These included reports by several foreign scientists as well as the renowned Paraguayan naturalist Moises Bertoni (whose information about <b>the</b> <b>Aché</b> was published posthumously). Finally, a German immigrant, Federico Maynthusen contacted a group of Aché in 1908, in the modern department of Itapua, and published information on both their language and culture.|$|E
