5|$|The {{bottom end}} {{of the body is}} an ampulla (a flask-like swelling), which anchors the animal in the tube and enables it to retract its body very quickly when threatened. When the lophophore is {{extended}} {{at the top of the}} body, cilia (little hairs) on the sides of the tentacles draw food particles to the mouth, which is inside and slightly <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base of the lophophore. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing a lid above the mouth or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The food then moves down to the stomach, which is in the ampulla. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E

There are two rooms on the upstairs floor, the southern one having been partitioned, plus an additional two rooms in the attic complete with modern fittings.

5|$|Following Jardine's {{appointment}} as England captain in July 1932, {{he developed a}} plan based on his belief that Bradman was weak against bowling directed at leg stump and that if this line of attack could be maintained, it would restrict Bradman's scoring <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field, giving the bowlers greater control of his scoring. In a meeting, he outlined his plan to Larwood and Voce, who tried out the tactic {{in the remainder of}} the season with mixed success. Both Nottinghamshire fast bowlers were selected to tour, as was Yorkshire bowler Bill Bowes who had tried similar tactics {{at the end of the}} season. In one match, he bowled short at Jack Hobbs; in his capacity as cricket correspondent of The Morning Post, Warner was highly critical of the Yorkshire bowlers and Bowes in particular. These remarks were seized upon by Australian opponents of Bodyline in the coming months. A fourth fast bowler, Middlesex amateur Gubby Allen, was later added to the tour. The selection of this many pace bowlers was unusual at the time, drawing comment from Australian writers, including Bradman.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{life was}} {{depicted}} {{in a series}} of contemporary illustrations sketched and water-coloured by the chronicler Matthew Paris, mostly drawn in the margins of the Chronica majora. Paris first met Henry in 1236 and enjoyed an extended relationship with the King, although Paris disliked many of Henry's actions and the illustrations are frequently unflattering. Henry was also shown in the poetry of his Italian contemporary Dante, who depicted Henry in the Divine Comedy {{as an example of a}} negligent ruler, sitting alone in Purgatory <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other failed kings. It is unclear why he is shown separately from his contemporaries; possible explanations include that this is a code by Dante to show that England was not part of the Holy Roman Empire, or that it is a favourable comment on Henry himself, highlighting his unusual piety. Unlike many other medieval kings, Henry did not feature significantly in the works of William Shakespeare, and in the modern period he has not been a prominent subject for films, theatre or television, having only a minimal role in modern popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the athlete}} has taken flight, {{characteristics}} {{similar to that}} of a glider come into force. Ski flyers are able to cover such tremendous distances and land safely primarily due to the skis they use, which are substantially wider and longer than their cross-country or Alpine skiing counterparts. Each ski is first attached securely {{at the front of the}} boot, which has an exaggerated forward slant; the heel is then attached to a wedge on the ski using a hinged binding peg or strap with a maximum length of , allowing the athlete to lean forward into their preferred aerodynamic position and spread the skis wide apart. Much like aircraft wings, the skis are flexible to an extent, resulting in them bending and vibrating significantly upon takeoff. Maintaining stability in the air is paramount: a loss of balance, or a differential pressure under the skis, can lead to disaster (see list of ski flying accidents). A few athletes have a natural tendency to drift over <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, invariably shortening their jump distance.|$|E

5|$|Player {{controls}} include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, firing torpedoes, and hyperspace. Initially {{these were}} controlled using the front-panel test {{switches on the}} PDP-1 minicomputer, with four switches for each player, but these proved to be awkward to use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power switches. The location of the switches also left one player off <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CRT display due to the limited space {{in front of the}} computer, which left them at a disadvantage. To alleviate these problems, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. The gamepad had a switch for turning left or right, another for forward thrust or hyperspace, and a torpedo launch button. The button was silent so that the opposing player would not have a warning that the player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a cooldown period.|$|E
5|$|The Metropolitan Railway Act 1885 {{had given}} Watkin {{permission}} {{to extend the}} line from Chesham {{to connect with the}} LNWR at Tring. Thus, although it was the terminus of the line, Chesham station was designed with a revival of the LNWR extension scheme in mind. The small station building was set <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tracks to allow for a possible extension onwards. The station had a single platform, with a run-around loop and turntable alongside, together with a coaling station and water tank. The station was lit by gas light until 1925; the local gas works, which consumed around 5,000tons of coal each year, threatened to withdraw their coal traffic from the line if the station were fitted with electric lighting. While Chalfont Road station initially served a sparsely populated rural area (the village of Little Chalfont had not yet grown around the station), Chesham station was busy, and {{at the time of its}} opening had a full staff of a stationmaster, two ticket inspectors, two clerks, two porters and two collectors.|$|E
5|$|The castle motte {{was built}} up in several stages, {{originally}} being lower in height than today, before being built up during the medieval period and scarped by cutting away at the surrounding stone. It was then reinforced in 1700 {{with the addition of}} clay, before having large quantities of earth dumped on it in the late 18th century, and then being terraced in the mid-19th century. The motte is separated from the bailey by a ditch, now crossed by a modern bridge. In the 13th century this point was protected by a D-shaped tower, which still survives, located <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gateway. The causeway steps {{up to the top of}} the mound were originally a roofed, stone corridor. There are the foundations of the castle well on the west side of the causeway.|$|E

5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand {{in your pocket}} when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an in-line or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged. Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances.|$|E
5|$|Following Jardine's appointment, {{a meeting}} was {{arranged}} with Nottinghamshire captain Arthur Carr {{and his two}} fast bowlers Larwood and Voce at London's Piccadilly Hotel. Jardine explained his belief that Bradman was weak against bowling directed at leg stump and that if this line of attack could be maintained, it would restrict Bradman's scoring <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field, giving the bowlers greater control of his scoring. Jardine asked Larwood and Voce if they could bowl accurately on leg stump and make the ball rise up {{into the body of}} the batsman. The bowlers agreed that they could, and that it might prove effective, but Jardine stressed that bowling accurately was vitally important, or Bradman would dominate the bowling. Larwood believed that Jardine saw Bradman as his main target and wished to attack him psychologically as well as in a cricketing sense. At the same time, other Australian batsmen were also discussed. Larwood and Voce practised the plan over the remainder of the 1932 season with mixed success. Jardine also visited Frank Foster who had toured Australia in 1911–12 to discuss field placings appropriate to Australian conditions. Foster had bowled leg theory on that tour with his fielders placed close in on the leg-side, as had George Hirst in 1903–04. During {{the second half of the}} season, the team to tour Australia was announced. The selection of four fast bowlers and a few medium pacers was very unusual at the time, and it was commented on by the hosts' media, including Bradman. The selection of Eddie Paynter, who did not have a strong record, to replace the ill Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji was very likely a choice of Jardine. He had a history of good performances against Yorkshire, and Jardine considered that a player's record against northern counties was a good indication of his potential at international level.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{decision that}} precedes almost every {{play in a}} baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, {{as well as its}} general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, with the result being runners on base, if any, advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.|$|E

40|$|A compact {{broadband}} {{microstrip antenna}} for mounting <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a ground plane comprises a closed (usually circular) array of antenna elements positioned <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a substrate for spacing the antenna elements a selected distance {{above the ground}} plane, the antenna elements being adapted to be electrically driven out of phase from <b>one</b> another <b>to</b> excite <b>one</b> or more spiral modes. In another form, a compact microstrip antenna comprises one or more antenna elements positioned <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a magnetic substrate for spacing the antenna elements a selected distance from a ground plane, the magnetic substrate being chosen to have a relative permittivity which is roughly equal to its relative permeability. In a third form, a microstrip antenna is adapted for operating in a single mode and radiation from other modes is suppressed by varying the spacing above the ground plane in the radiation zones so that only radiation in the desired mode is fostered.
