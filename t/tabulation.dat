5|$|Another {{method of}} {{constructing}} hash functions with both high quality and practical speed is <b>tabulation</b> hashing. In this method, the hash value for a key {{is computed by}} using each byte of the key as an index into a table of random numbers (with a different table for each byte position). The numbers from those table cells are then combined by a bitwise exclusive or operation. Hash functions constructed this way are only 3-independent. Nevertheless, linear probing using these hash functions takes constant expected time per operation. Both <b>tabulation</b> hashing and standard methods for generating 5-independent hash functions are limited to keys that have a fixed number of bits. To handle strings or other types of variable-length keys, {{it is possible to}} compose a simpler universal hashing technique that maps the keys to intermediate values and a higher quality (5-independent or <b>tabulation)</b> hash function that maps the intermediate values to hash table indices.|$|E
5|$|Linear probing {{can provide}} high {{performance}} {{because of its}} good locality of reference, but is {{more sensitive to the}} quality of its hash function than some other collision resolution schemes. It takes constant expected time per search, insertion, or deletion when implemented using a random hash function, a 5-independent hash function, or <b>tabulation</b> hashing. However, good results can be achieved in practice with other hash functions such as MurmurHash.|$|E
5|$|Another {{assessment}} system, Chessmetrics, {{calculates that}} Gossip's highest rating was 2470 (number 50 in the world) in April 1889. By comparison, the world's three highest-rated players {{at that time}} had Chessmetrics ratings over 2700. Chessmetrics also ranks Gossip number 17 in the world during four one-month periods between February and July 1873, when opportunities for high-level competition were much rarer. Like Diggle, Chessmetrics considers New York 1889 Gossip's best individual performance, concluding that he scored 39% against opponents with an average rating of 2595, giving him a performance rating of 2539 for that tournament. In 1904, the Deutsche Schachzeitung, {{on the basis of}} its <b>tabulation</b> of players' percentage scores in all major international tournaments from London 1851 to Cambridge Springs 1904, ranked Gossip the number 62 living player in the world.|$|E

Additionally, the Seattle area had the highest percentage of self-identified mixed-race people of any large metropolitan area in the United States, according to the 2000 United States Census Bureau.
