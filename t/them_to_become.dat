5|$|After World War II, {{there was}} a {{worldwide}} disbandment of British forts as advances in air defence systems caused <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> obsolete.

40|$|It is way {{too soon}} to teach our {{computers}} how <b>to</b> <b>become</b> full-fledged humans. It is even premature <b>to</b> teach <b>them</b> how <b>to</b> <b>become</b> mathematicians, it is even unwise, at present, <b>to</b> teach <b>them</b> how <b>to</b> <b>become</b> combinatorialists. But the time is ripe <b>to</b> teach <b>them</b> how <b>to</b> <b>become</b> experts in a suitably defined and narrowly focused subarea of combinatorics.

5|$|By the mid-1600s, the Sihanaka {{had already}} {{established}} themselves {{as one of}} the island's most important trading groups. Their location on the main trade route between the coast and the Merina capital of Antananarivo enabled <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> important trading partners beginning in the 18th century; slave trading was a major source of income until outlawed under Radama I in the 1810s. The Sihanaka women also produced pottery, which was baked using wood collected by men in the surrounding forests.|$|E
5|$|In Parhelion Peak, the game's snow zone, Sonic and Tails {{notice a}} feather float {{down from the}} sky. They board another of Eggman's {{airships}} and complete another zone, whereupon they find another feather. They trace the feathers to Eggman's bird-like robot, which is guarding the Emeralds. Sonic retrieves the Emeralds and uses <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> Super Sonic. He fights the robot as the game's final boss. After its defeat, Sonic and Tails fly aboard the Tornado once more—the segue into the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 3.|$|E

5|$|Alimuddin {{started his}} {{international}} career against England in June 1954, at the Lord's Cricket Ground, in a match {{in which he}} scored 19 runs. In the fourth Test of the same series Pakistan beat England by 24 runs, recording their first Test win over <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> {{the first team to}} defeat England during their maiden tour. Alimuddin managed to score 10 runs in the match. In 1954–55, he played, against India, in Pakistan's first home Tests, finishing the series as the leading run scorer with 332; he made three fifties and in the fifth match scored 103 not out at the National Stadium, Karachi, his first international century. He was the first batsman ever to make an international century on the Ground.|$|E
5|$|An English fan {{translation}} of Ace Attorney Investigations 2, subtitled Prosecutor's Path, has been developed, and includes localized names for new {{characters in the}} style of Capcom's Ace Attorney localizations. The translation project was done on the Ace Attorney fan site Court-Records, where a user asked people who were interested in the project to send in applications, which had to be approved for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> part of the project. Alexa Ray Corriea at Polygon described this approach as uncommon, with most fan translation projects letting anyone help if they want, but said that it made the project more professional. A patch translating the game's first two episodes was released in 2013, and a complete patch for the game was released in 2014. A final patch was later released in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Aquarists also {{propagate}} animals {{behind the}} scenes for the aquarium’s exhibits. Since 1985, the aquarium has been deeply involved in jellyfish propagation, creating three temporary exhibitions and one permanent aquarium gallery within the Open Sea wing. In August 2016, aquarists cultured comb jellies {{for the first time}} in a laboratory, which may allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a model organism. For the aquarium's temporary exhibition that opened in 2014, the aquarium cultured many cephalopods because of their short life cycles. A display in the exhibition showcased how aquarists rear different species of cephalopods, including the bigfin reef squid. In partnership with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, at least two deep-sea cephalopod species have been displayed in the exhibition, including flapjack octopuses and the vampire squid.|$|E
5|$|Brooks' first {{venture into}} wrestling was {{a stint in}} a {{backyard}} wrestling federation called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation with his friends and brother Mike Brooks in the mid-late 1990s. He first started using the ring name CM Punk when he was put into a tag team named The Chick Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the card. Unlike his friends, Punk genuinely {{wanted to be a}} wrestler and saw it as more than simple fun. When the promotion started taking off, doing shows out of a warehouse in Mokena, Illinois, Punk found out that his brother Mike had embezzled thousands of dollars from the small company, causing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> estranged. They have not spoken since.|$|E
5|$|Burns {{continued}} to play club cricket in Somerset for Taunton St Andrews Cricket Club until 2009, helping <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> West of England Premier League champions in his final season with the club. He made minor counties appearances for Cumberland throughout 2006, before switching to Cornwall in 2008. He also toured with the Marylebone Cricket Club, travelling to Brazil and Chile in March 2007, and to Saint Kitts and Nevis in March 2008. He has subsequently stood as an umpire, and after standing in second-eleven matches in 2011, he {{was added to the}} ECB's reserve list of umpires for 2012. He made his debut as an umpire in first-class matches in March 2012, officiating in the match between Somerset and the Cardiff MCC University side.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{of science}} have noted that, while Darwin {{considered}} the ideas in Wallace's paper to be {{essentially the same}} as his own, there were differences. Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge. Some historians, notably Peter J. Bowler, have suggested the possibility that in the paper he mailed to Darwin, Wallace was not discussing selection of individual variations at all but rather group selection. However, Malcolm Kottler has shown that this notion is incorrect and Wallace was indeed discussing individual variations.|$|E
5|$|In June 1963 the Spokane Comets Western Hockey League {{franchise}} {{was purchased}} by a group led by the Maple Leafs, who relocated <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> the Denver Invaders and act as the Leaf's farm team. Though the league did not acknowledge that the Maple Leafs had an ownership stake in the team, they held a majority position with the Denver partners only owning roughly 36%. Following reported losses of $150,000 in their first season, Smythe announced that the team would be relocated after the team failed to reach a 2,000 season ticket target by a league-imposed deadline. The team became the Victoria Maple Leafs for the following season. In June 1967 MLGL sold the team for $500,000 to a group from Phoenix, which relocated it to become the Phoenix Roadrunners.|$|E
5|$|Swarming {{behaviour}} is {{a response}} to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. The transformation of the locust to the swarming form is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. A large swarm can consist of billions of locusts spread out over an area of thousands of square kilometres, with a population of up to 80 million individuals per square kilometre (200 million per square mile). When desert locusts meet, their nervous systems release serotonin, which causes <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> mutually attracted, a prerequisite for swarming.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{place in}} modern-day Tokyo and {{featuring}} real-life locations such as Shibuya and Harajuku, the game centers around evil beings known as Mirages {{who seek to}} harvest an energy known as Performa from humans and are responsible for several disappearances.

5|$|The {{adult male}} and female both are active in {{protecting}} and feeding the fledged chicks until they learn to forage on their own. The adult robin gives alarm calls and dives in a threatening manner towards creatures it considers potential predators, such as approaching cats, dogs and humans. The fledglings are able to fly short distances after leaving the nest. The wings of juvenile birds develop rapidly, and it only takes {{a couple of weeks}} for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> proficient at flying. The cryptically colored young birds perch in bushes or trees for protection from predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} of defamation suits brought by Government ministers and PAP MPs against critics, in particular political opponents, {{has been a}} cause for concern for organizations such as the International Bar Association and the United States Department of State. Amnesty International has referred to the use of civil defamation suits as a strategy by the government to inhibit the public activities of opposition politicians. This is due to how high awards of damages often cripple opposition politicians financially, causing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> bankrupt and thus lose their parliamentary seats or become ineligible to run for elections. The resulting perception is that Singapore's leadership has a long-standing reputation for using defamation actions as a mechanism for removing opposition members from the Singapore Parliament or for inhibiting opposing political views.|$|E
