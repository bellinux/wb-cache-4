5000|$|Used {{for very}} short {{distances}} where a solid metal bar {{is attached to}} the casualty. Used mainly with commercial vehicles, which often have a <b>towing</b> <b>eye</b> in the front bumper. In the case of cars and light vans, the towing vehicle can be used for braking, if the bar is kept straight. With commercial vehicles, it is common to connect an air feed to the casualty to allow the tow vehicle's brakes to also operate the casualty's brakes. In the US, both [...] "soft" [...] and [...] "rigid" [...] tows are called [...] "flat tows", although if a rigid bar is used it may be called a [...] "bar tow".|$|E
5000|$|A dumper is {{a vehicle}} {{designed}} for carrying bulk material, often on building sites. Dumpers are distinguished from dump trucks by configuration: a dumper is usually an open 4-wheeled vehicle with the load skip {{in front of}} the driver, while a dump truck has its cab {{in front of the}} load. The skip can tip to dump the load; this is where the name [...] "dumper" [...] comes from. They are normally diesel powered. A <b>towing</b> <b>eye</b> is fitted for secondary use as a site tractor. Dumpers with rubber tracks are used in special circumstances and provide a more even distribution of weight compared to tires. Continuous tracks allow the operator to carry heavier payload on slick, snowy, or muddy surfaces, and are popular in some countries.|$|E
5000|$|Standard {{equipment}} suite includes {{rear view}} camera, thermal front camera, air conditioning system, blackout lighting system, multi-point seat belts, radio provisions, and a <b>towing</b> <b>eye.</b> It can be optionally {{equipped with a}} self-recovery winch, nuclear, biological and chemical filtration kit, automation fire extinguishing system, intercom system, navigation system and an auxiliary power unit. In an APC configuration the vehicle can carry nine personnel and the vehicle can be armed {{with a number of}} different weapons, including crew-operated machine guns and remote weapon stations armed with short-range surface-to-air missiles and grenade launchers. Powered by a 6.7L, six-cylinder, water cooled, turbo charged, common rail diesel engine that produces 281 hp, its maximum road speed is 110 km/h on roads and has a maximum cruising range of 700 km ...|$|E

50|$|While not {{designed}} for front-line combat operations, the Jeep J8 is fully armour capable (BRV 2009 VR7) {{and can be used}} for a variety of duties ranging from command vehicle, troop/cargo carrier, ambulance or communications vehicle. Heavy-duty bumpers with <b>tow</b> <b>eyes</b> allow the Jeep J8 to be easily transported by fixed wing aircraft or helicopter.|$|R

The axle under the smokebox (on the left) pivots to allow the engine to be steered. <b>Towing</b> <b>eyes</b> are provided on the same axle assembly to allow the engine to be pulled along.|$|R
5000|$|When the Rabbit GTI first {{appeared}} in Canada, it featured the 78 hp 1.6L K-Jetronic engine and wide ratio five-speed transmission. It was initially available in red, white, and black. These Canadian cars were German-built and were nearly identical in bodyshell and interior appearance to the [...] Golfs built in Europe. Unfortunately for enthusiasts, the entire driveline and running gear was identical to the other Canadian versions. Five-MPH bumpers were fitted as well as anti-intrusion bars within the doors. The <b>towing</b> <b>eye</b> integral {{to the front of}} the European car was deleted as the crashworthy bumper's shock absorbers had towing facilities as part of their design and the car had been crash-tested for Canada with the North American front apron. The car was very attractive but drove no better or worse than a Rabbit of the same era. Only with the arrival of the American GTI was a faster Golf available in Canada, and it was down [...] compared to the 1.8 litre Golf GTI Mk1. A small number of European specification GTIs made it to Canada under an agreement with the government that allowed foreign soldiers training at Canadian military facilities to bring their personal vehicles with them. As a result of this, VW made available (for many years) all unique European model parts required through VW of Canada. It was possible then, although expensive, to build a [...] "real" [...] GTI. Some enthusiasts did so based on the reputation of the European car.|$|E
5000|$|A7 {{was ordered}} {{as part of}} the 1903-04 Naval Programme from at Vickers. She was laid down at their {{shipyard}} in Barrow-in-Furness on 1 September 1903, launched on 21 January 1905 and completed on 13 April. She sank in Whitsand Bay, Cornwall on 16 January 1914 with the loss of her crew whilst carrying out dummy torpedo attacks on [...] in conjunction with submarine [...] A disturbance in the water was seen which thought to be caused by the crew of A7 attempting to blow water from her ballast tanks {{in a desperate attempt to}} reach the surface. [...] The location was marked with a buoy and Pygmy returned to Plymouth Sound to report on the disaster. Pygmy returned to the site in the afternoon but was unable to locate the buoy as the weather had deteriorated. It then took five days to relocate the submarine, she was found in 121 ft depth with 20 ft of her stern buried in the muddy seabed and with her bow 33 ft off the bottom, raised at an angle of 30Â°. [...] Several attempts were made to salvage her over the next month by attaching a hawser to the <b>towing</b> <b>eye</b> on the bow or wrapping steel hawsers around her hull, but her stern was too deeply embedded in the mud and the hawsers parted without pulling her out. She lies today where she sank, buried up to her waterline in a flat, mud seabed in about 121 ft of water. In 2001, she was declared as one of 16 wrecks in British waters designated as [...] "Controlled Sites" [...] under the Protection of Military Remains Act by the British Government and which cannot be dived without special permission.|$|E
50|$|The current {{modification}} of the Liaz truck {{is a result of}} a ten-year continuous development by the team around Martin Macik. The team holds two almost identical race specials, which differ only in the number of turbochargers used. Liaz Race Truck 1 was driven by Jaroslav Valtr at Dakar 2013 and its engine is charged with one turbocharger. The truck was primarily built in 2011 and at its construction certain components from the trucks that Martin Macik and Vlastimil Vildman drove in 2009-2011 were used. Most importantly, the truck received a new chassis frame set with an increased rigidity and integrated <b>tow</b> <b>eyes</b> at the front and rear. New leaf springs with a different suspension characteristics were supplied and, as a new thing, shock absorbers made by FRT are mounted.|$|R

The team holds two almost identical race specials, which differ only in the number of turbochargers used. Liaz Race Truck 2 was driven by Vlastimil Vildman at Dakar 2013 and by Jozef Cabala at Dakar 2012 and its engine is charged with two KKK Garret turbochargers. The truck was primarily built in 2011 completely new. Most importantly, the truck received a new chassis frame set with an increased rigidity and integrated <b>tow</b> <b>eyes</b> at the front and rear. New leaf springs with a different suspension characteristics were supplied and, as a new thing, shock absorbers made by FRT are mounted. Another modification with the aim of handling improvement are different cross torque stabilizers fixed above the chassis frame with a rod on one side and an additional shock absorber on the other one. All chassis accessories are completely re-arranged with the aim of optimum weight distribution - the fuel tank is mounted in the rear and the air tanks are also re-arranged.|$|R
2500|$|In September 1996, the {{decommissioned}} Kiro was to {{be disposed}} by sinking. The designated position for disposal was , however, the unfavorable weather and the very poor material condition of the ship hampered the attempt to tow her. The mast broke off and fell into the sea {{just as she was}} exiting the Suva Harbour channel, and later the <b>towing</b> pad <b>eye</b> was ripped off the deck, due its rotten state. Kiro drifted onto a reef at [...] where she broke in two. The wreck was later doused with fuel and set on fire. She burned continuously for 19 hours leaving only the engines and the very lower part of the hull.|$|R
