40|$|The thermal {{expansion}} of <b>tienoxolol</b> {{has been investigated}} by X-ray powder diffraction up to its melting temperature. The data indicate that the expansion is anisotropic and even negative in one direction of the unit cell. The supramolecular structure formed by hydrogenbonds reflects that of a trellis, which explains the observed behavior of <b>tienoxolol</b> crystals. Postprint (published version...|$|E
