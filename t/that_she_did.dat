5|$|Anne had {{explained}} before <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not wish {{the public to}} know that her relationship with Sarah was failing, because any sign that Sarah was out of favour would have a damaging impact on the Duke of Marlborough's authority as Captain-General.

This year was to see the end of their relationship for good.|$|E

5|$|Helena was {{closest to}} her brother, Prince Alfred, who {{considered}} her his favourite sister. Though described by contemporaries as fearfully {{devoted to the}} Queen, to the point <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not have a mind of her own, she actively campaigned for women's rights, a field the Queen abhorred. Nevertheless, both she and Beatrice remained closest to the Queen, and Helena remained close to her mother's side until the latter's death. Her name {{was the last to}} be written in the Queen's seventy-year-old journal.|$|E

Her teachers identified her skills and talents early on and within {{a short period of time}} she was offered full scholarships to study abroad at prestigious ballet schools.

There had been a recent family argument about placing the children in foster care.|$|E

At first, she received government rations for her work, but newly freed blacks thought she was getting special treatment. To ease the tension, she gave up her right to these supplies and made money selling pies and root beer, which she made in the evenings.|$|E
