The king would appoint peers to <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> Peers on a hereditary basis, or for life at his discretion. Deputies would be elected every five years, with one fifth of them up for election each year. There were 90,000 citizens eligible to vote.|$|E

The legislature could not operate alone and the monarch could not force his will upon the Assembly. The system functioned smoothly only when both Assembly and Emperor acted in a spirit of cooperation for the national good.|$|E

5|$|The Alabama {{legislature}} {{passed the}} Cater Act in 1949, allowing {{cities and counties}} to set up industrial development boards (IDB) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. George E. McNally, Mobile's first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was {{the driving force behind}} the founding of the IDB. The Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, believing its members were better qualified to attract new businesses and industry to the area, considered the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> Commerce emerged victorious.
