Individual-patient data from six cohorts reporting B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) were obtained. These biomarkers were dichotomized using <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> p <b>value</b> method and compared with previously reported ROC curve-derived thresholds using logistic regression analysis. A final prediction model was developed, internally validated, and assessed for its sensitivity to clustering effects. Finally, a preoperative risk score system was proposed. Thresholds identified by <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> p <b>value</b> method and ROC curve approach were 115.57  pg/ml (p <  0.001) and 116  pg/ml for BNP, and 241.7  pg/ml (p =  0.001) and 277.5  pg/ml for NTproBNP, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>minimum</b> p <b>value</b> thresholds were slightly stronger predictors based on our logistic regression analysis. The final model included a composite predictor of <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> p <b>value</b> method’s BNP and NTproBNP thresholds [odds ratio (OR) =  8.5, p <  0.001], surgery type (OR =  2.5, p =  0.002), and diabetes (OR =  2.1, p =  0.015). Preoperative risks using the scoring system ranged from 2 to 49  %. <b>The</b> <b>minimum</b> p <b>value</b> method and ROC curve approach identify similar optimal thresholds. We propose to replace the revised cardiac risk index with our risk score system for individual-specific preoperative risk stratification after noncardiac nonvascular surgery.|$|R
