5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of North American Armillaria species based on {{analysis of}} amplified fragment length polymorphism data suggests that A.gallica is most {{closely related to}} A.sinapina, A. cepistipes, and A. calvescens. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> similar to those reported in 1992 that compared sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA.|$|E

25|$|Number {{theory has}} the {{reputation}} of being a field many of whose results can be stated to the layperson. At the same time, the proofs of <b>these</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> not particularly accessible, in part because the range of tools they use is, if anything, unusually broad within mathematics.|$|E
25|$|OECs {{are similar}} to Schwann cells in that they provide an {{upregulation}} of low-affinity NGF receptor p75 following injury; however, unlike Schwann cells they produce lower levels of neurotrophins. Several studies have shown evidence of OECs being able to support regeneration of lesioned axons, but <b>these</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> often unable to be reproduced.|$|E

25|$|Official {{results of}} the {{referendum}} showed that 59.24% of the Portuguese approved the proposal put on ballot, while 40.76% rejected it. However, only 43.61% of the registered voters turned out to vote. Since abstention was over 50%, according to the Portuguese Constitution, <b>these</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> not legally binding, and parliament can legally decide to disregard them. Prime Minister Sócrates nevertheless confirmed that he would expand {{the circumstances under which}} abortion was allowed, since a majority of voters had been in favour.|$|E
25|$|Irwin's {{conclusion}} regarding transsaccadic {{memory is}} that there are no separate mechanisms, but that rather it is the same as short-term visual memory. Irwin's experiments showed that people cannot fuse pre-saccadic and post-saccadic images in successive fixations. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> evidence against spatiotopic fusion. According to Irwin, there is no transsaccadic buffer that holds visual information from one fixation point to the next. Also, transaccadic memory does not hold detailed spatial information, but a more abstract representation. Irwin describes transaccadic memory as an undetailed, limited capacity memory that is relatively long-lasting.|$|E
25|$|It {{may occur}} that systems of {{coordinates}} for two {{different sets of}} geometric figures are equivalent {{in terms of their}} analysis. An example of this is the systems of homogeneous coordinates for points and lines in the projective plane. The two systems {{in a case like this}} are said to be dualistic. Dualistic systems have the property that results from one system can be carried over to the other since <b>these</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> only different interpretations of the same analytical result; this is known as the principle of duality.|$|E

25|$|The {{invasive}} green crab, Carcinus maenas, {{can turn}} off top down control by facilitating {{the recovery of}} salt marsh ecosystems. In marshes that have experienced die-off via the trophic cascade initiated by recreational overfishing, purple marsh crabs, Sesarma reticulatum, can be evicted by the larger green crabs, which prey upon the purple crab. In this way, green crabs can indirectly reduce purple crab herbivory and promotes cordgrass recovery. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> encouraging because they suggest that invasive species, which are classically considered to have mostly negative impacts on the ecosystems they invade, can sometimes actually contribute to restoring degraded ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|Cho et al. {{made the}} first study on {{policies}} for crawling scheduling. Their data set was a 180,000-pages crawl from the stanford.edu domain, in which a crawling simulation was done with different strategies. The ordering metrics tested were breadth-first, backlink count and partial Pagerank calculations. One of the conclusions was that if the crawler wants to download pages with high Pagerank early during the crawling process, then the partial Pagerank strategy is the better, followed by breadth-first and backlink-count. However, <b>these</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> for just a single domain. Cho also wrote his Ph.D. dissertation at Stanford on web crawling.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{consistent}} with ZF + DC that every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable; however, this consistency result, due to Robert M. Solovay, cannot be proved in ZFC itself, but requires a mild large cardinal assumption (the existence of an inaccessible cardinal). The much stronger axiom of determinacy, or AD, implies that every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, has the property of Baire, and has the perfect set property (all three of <b>these</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> refuted by AC itself). ZF + DC + AD is consistent provided that a sufficiently strong large cardinal axiom is consistent (the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals).|$|E

25|$|The unique subgame perfect {{equilibrium}} (and every Nash equilibrium) {{of these}} games {{indicates that the}} first player take the pot on the very {{first round of the}} game; however, in empirical tests, relatively few players do so, and as a result, achieve a higher payoff than the payoff predicted by the equilibria analysis. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> taken to show that subgame perfect equilibria and Nash equilibria fail to predict human play in some circumstances. The Centipede game is commonly used in introductory game theory courses and texts to highlight the concept of backward induction and the iterated elimination of dominated strategies, which show a standard way of providing a solution to the game.|$|E
500|$|Psilocybin {{is known}} to {{strongly}} influence the subjective experience of the passage of time. Users often feel as if time is slowed down, resulting in the perception that [...] "minutes appear to be hours" [...] or [...] "time is standing still". Studies have demonstrated that psilocybin significantly impairs subjects' ability to gauge time intervals longer than 2.5seconds, impairs their ability to synchronize to inter-beat intervals longer than 2seconds, and reduces their preferred tapping rate. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> consistent with the drug's role in affecting prefrontal cortex activity, and {{the role that the}} prefrontal cortex {{is known to}} play in time perception. However, the neurochemical basis of psilocybin's effects on the perception of time are not known with certainty.|$|E
