2500|$|After {{both men}} have {{fallen to the}} ground from their {{separate}} shootings, another man, Eric (Shia LaBeouf), enters looking for them (saying he's [...] "just thought of the funniest thing"). Dave comes back to life to shoot Eric in the stomach, who collapses, once again to the same music. The sister herself (Kristen Wiig) enters the scene, and begins to read the letter (Dear Sister, By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>this..)</b> until she too is shot in the gut several times by {{each of the three}} men on the ground, with the music cue restarting with every shot, until she collapses too.|$|E
2500|$|One notable {{unfavorable}} opinion {{appeared in}} the Daily Mail. In the piece, the plot of The Fault in Our Stars was described as [...] "mawkish at best, exploitative at worst" [...] and the book was characterized as belonging to the [...] "sick-lit" [...] young adult genre, together with other young-adult novels such as Never Eighteen and Before I Die. This entire genre, {{as well as the}} genre of young-adult novels dealing with suicide and self-harm (the piece mentions Thirteen Reasons Why, By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>You</b> <b>Read</b> <b>This,</b> I'll Be Dead, [...] The Lovely Bones, and Red Tears) was criticized as being [...] "distasteful" [...] and inappropriate for their target audience of teens. The Guardian criticized the piece, pointing out in particular that The Fault in Our Stars was chosen by The Guardian as that month's [...] "teen book club choice" [...] because [...] "it's a gripping read, featuring two compelling characters, that deals sensitively and even humorously with a difficult situation without descending into mawkishness." [...] In general, The Guardian faulted the Daily Mail for suggesting that the issues of illness, depression, and sexuality are inappropriate precisely [...] "in the one place where difficult subjects have traditionally been most sensitively explored for teens: fiction written specifically for them." [...] For his part, in an interview for The Guardian, John Green said: [...] "The thing that bothered me about The Daily Mail piece was that it was a bit condescending to teenagers. I'm tired of adults telling teenagers that they aren't smart, that they can't read critically, that they aren't thoughtful, and I feel like that article made those arguments." ...|$|E

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} {{has been}} mixed. Brad Rice of Japanator {{gave it a}} 9.0, commenting that while the manga {{would be unlikely to}} have [...] "true lasting value", it will be [...] "absolutely captivating <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> it". In contrast, Anime News Network and Otaku USA both gave more mixed reviews, with the reviewer for Otaku USA stating that [...] "While the fast pace is welcome, the story itself isn't quite as gripping as it should be, and Takahiro Seguchi's more-than-competent artwork is pretty, but lacks a spark of its own." ...|$|R

And if, at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>this,</b> {{you can run}} out {{and gather}} a true violet, and its leaf, {{you will find that}} the flower grows from the very ground, out of a cluster of {{heart-shaped}} leaves, becoming here a little rounder, there a little sharper, but on the whole heart-shaped, and that is the proper and essential form of the violet leaf. You will find also that the flower has five petals; and being held down by the bent stalk, two of them bend back and up, as if resisting it; two expand at the sides; and one, the principal, grows downwards, with its attached spur behind. So that the front view of the flower must be some modification of this typical arrangement, Fig. M, (for middle form). Now the statement above quoted from Figuier, § 16, means, if {{he had been able to}} express himself, that the two lateral petals in the violet are directed downwards, Fig. II. A, and in the pansy upwards, Fig. II. C. And that, in the main, is true, and to be fixed well and clearly in your mind. But in the real orders, one flower passes into the other through all kinds of intermediate positions of petal, and the plurality of species are of the middle type. Fig. II. B.[3] ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{you must}} {{recollect}} {{that it is}} not a book to be read with as much ease as its pleasant style may lead you to imagine. You spin through it as if it were a novel <b>the</b> first <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> it, and think you know all about it; <b>the</b> second <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> it <b>you</b> think you know rather less about it; and <b>the</b> third <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> are amazed to find how little you have really apprehended its vast scope and objects. I can positively say that I never take it up without finding in it some new view, or light, or suggestion that I have not noticed before. That is the best characteristic of a thorough and profound book; and I believe this feature of the [...] "Origin of Species" [...] explains why so many persons have ventured to pass judgment and criticisms upon it which are by no means worth the paper they are written on.|$|R
5000|$|Romeo Alaeff's {{art work}} has been {{described}} as [...] "blurring the boundaries between icon and art, funny and serious, traditional and experimental, public and private" [...] and [...] "explores the experience of inhabiting liminal zones, those architectural spaces, psychological and physical states in which contradictions collide." [...] Alaeff often approaches his work with a sardonic or dark sense of humor such as in his project The Evolution of Despair which consists of a series of detailed drawings of animals expressing human thoughts and emotions. His book, I'll be Dead by <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>You</b> <b>Read</b> This: <b>The</b> Existential Life of Animals [...] is a continuation of that body of work. A sticker campaign was also launched from the original Evolution of Despair drawings and is featured in the book and exhibition tour, Stuck-up Piece of Crap: Stickers: From Punk Rock to Contemporary Art.|$|R

Four-year-old Alice and her Blisshaven Preschool classmates will ring true to any parent.

But I think my favorite character is Alices older brother, Petey. A haunted, controlling milquetoast, hes surely one of the most neurotic kids to appear in comics. These children and their struggles are presented affectionately, {{and one of the things}} I like best about Cul de Sac is its natural warmth. Cul de Sac avoids both mawkishness and cynicism and instead finds genuine charm in its loopy appreciation of small events. Very few strips can hit this subtle note.|$|R
