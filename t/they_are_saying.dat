'It will serve as a challenge for me, they do not know what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> before I have also experienced this before I started boxing, but I proved them wrong.', Pacquiao said.|$|E
25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E
500|$|During the controversy, Resistance: Fall of Man {{rose from}} 40th {{place in the}} United Kingdom's top 40 Full Priced video games chart to 22nd place for the week of 17 July to 23 July. It {{remained}} in the top 30 through the next week falling to 27th place, and to 36th place in the next week. In November 2009, IGN.com placed the incident in their [...] "Top 10 Gaming Controversies". It was also selected as a finalist along with six other games in the BAFTA British Academy Video Game Awards for the [...] "PC World Gamers Award", {{which is the only}} category based on sales and public reception. The Dean of Manchester Cathedral, the Very Reverend Rogers Govender, criticised the selection, stating that [...] "BAFTA should not be seen condoning such behaviour unless <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> it is acceptable for producers to walk into historic buildings and film interiors– ignoring contracts, rights and liability", asking for either BAFTA or Sony to withdraw the game from the award. Neither withdrew it, but it ultimately lost to Football Manager 2007.|$|E

500|$|Section 5 {{is based}} on Article 9 of the United Kingdom's Bill of Rights 1689: [...] "he [...] of Speech and Debates or Proceedings in [...] {{ought not to be}} impeached or {{questioned}} in any Court or Place out of [...]" [...] On the basis of this provision, and for other reasons, a long line of authorities in the Commonwealth have held that courts are precluded from impeaching or questioning the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament. This is so even if the legal action is brought by, and not against, a member of the legislature. Immunity also extends to independent persons appointed by Parliament exercising their duties in relation to Parliament's activities. In Prebble v. Television New Zealand Ltd. (1994), the Privy Council held that if any exceptions were made unless in the most extreme circumstances, members of the legislature would not know if there would subsequently be challenges to what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> in Parliament. Therefore, members would not have the confidence to state fully and freely what they have to say.|$|E
500|$|The most {{commonly}} given {{answer is that}} we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior; we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they must be like us in other ways, including having experiences {{of the sort that}} we do. [...] There are, however, a variety of problems with that explanation. [...] For one thing, it seems to violate the principle of parsimony, by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe. [...] Some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett in an essay titled The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies, argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> [...] More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior. [...] A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can do, including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences.|$|E
2500|$|The movie Airplane! and its sequel feature two inner-city African Americans {{speaking}} in heavily accented slang, which another character {{refers to as}} if it were a foreign language: [...] "Jive".

2500|$|After {{they were}} signed to BBC Two, {{they became the}} hosts and fashion advisors for five series of the BBC style series What Not to Wear in 2001, where they used their {{knowledge}} on fashion and harsh comments to reform the appearances and style of the participants on the show. The duo became instantly renowned for their poking and prodding of the contestants, their straight-talking advice, and frequently referring to breasts as tits. The editor of ELLE, Sarah Bailey, has stated [...] "You just don't expect posh girls to grab your tits, call your trousers 'too clitty' and use words like 'pussy pelmet' but they do. You are so shocked by what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> {{that by the time}} you have recovered and thought of something to say they have whipped you out of your jeans and eased you into a Lycra cat suit." [...] They have stated that their relationship is more like a marriage and that being total opposites, they balance each other out. They cannot imagine working without each other and have even considered taking insurance out on their television partnership should something unforeseen happen. Woodall and Constantine have been accused of being patronising, but reject these claims.|$|E
