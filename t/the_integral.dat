Production was divided up so major sections could be completed individually and manufacturing of the type could be dispersed to reduce vulnerability to attack. Establishing initial full-rate production for the type was difficult; manufacturing the Hunter required the development of 3,250 tool designs and the procurement of 40,000 fixtures, jigs, and tools.|$|E

5|$|The first {{microscopic}} {{sample of}} 253Es sample weighing about 10 nanograms was prepared in 1961 at HFIR. A special magnetic balance {{was designed to}} estimate its weight. Larger batches were produced later starting from several kilograms of plutonium with the einsteinium yields (mostly 253Es) of 0.48 milligrams in 1967–1970, 3.2 milligrams in 1971–1973, followed by steady production of about 3 milligrams per year between 1974 and 1978.

Unfortunately the truncation apparently destroys the Lorentz invariance of <b>the</b> <b>integrals.</b> This note ar- gues that <b>the</b> <b>integrals</b> are naturally truncated by the graininess of the negative-energy Planck vacuum state from which the zero-point vacuum arises, and are thus automati- cally Lorentz invariant...|$|R
