5|$|Bob {{has been}} fooled by Jeanie's lies {{about why they}} are not going out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>what</b> happens in the wings during the {{upcoming}} Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight. Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts the tray back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as {{more and more of the}} dancers become aware something has gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.|$|E
25|$|As {{the word}} of a missing diver in the Vortex Spring cave got out, other cave divers came for what they assumed would be a {{recovery}} operation, {{taking advantage of the}} weekend. The McDaniels were called, and they drove down to Florida, along with Greer, <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>what</b> they could from the shore. News media in the Panhandle and Memphis followed the search closely.|$|E
25|$|While {{in command}} of the Jane, Rodgers' strong and {{determined}} character was made evident during one of his voyages navigating the North Sea. Adverse winter winds had carried the vessel off course, the ship's provisions were almost exhausted, and three of his crewmen had frozen to death in one night, while most of the others had lapsed into hopeless despair. When Rodgers ordered some of the crew to go aloft to secure the ice encrusted rigging, they refused. Outraged at their desolation, Rodgers stripped off his jacket and shirt and, before going aloft, told the insubordinate crew <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>what</b> a man could do. While he climbed the frozen rigging bare-chested, the crew, awe struck, immediately rose to his aid and in little time they secured the faltering rigging. Under the grim circumstances of their situation Rodgers put the matter behind him and days later they safely reached port.|$|E

25|$|The {{regular season}} {{concluded}} with the match in Columbus, {{and the result}} matched the all-time worst in United's team history. The United attack hardly ever threatened, but it was shoddy work by the back line that really did in the team, as a 5-0 loss dropped the team into 4th place. That left United as host for a midweek 'play-in' match at home against a New England Revolution team that finished {{the season with a}} convincing 3-1 win at NYCFC. On a rainy day in the D.C. area, one of the smallest crowds of the year turned out <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>what</b> proved {{to be one of the}} most entertaining games in the MLS season. Typical of the 2015 edition of the team, D.C. United fell behind in the first 15 minutes, but it was hard to fault the quality of a spectacular bicycle goal by New England's Juan Agudelo. Following the goal, the Revolution continued to press but Hamid was able to keep United in the match with some big saves. United leveled the score on a free kick in the 45th minute, as Pontius scored on a header set-up by Espindola's service. Pontius would have to leave the game in the second half, due to hamstring tightness. The D.C. team missed a chance to go ahead in the 75th minute, when Rolfe failed to convert a penalty kick, striking the inside of the post. Rolfe, however, got redemption, scoring in the 83rd minute, finishing off a cutback centering pass from Espindola, DeLeon was also credited with an assist for his nifty back-heel that set-up Espindola's run to the end line. Another spectacular save by Hamid denied a header bid by Revolution's Jermaine Jones in the late-going. The game ended on a controversial note, as Jermaine Jones was shown a red card for grabbing the referee while protesting the decision not to award a penalty kick for an apparent handball against United defender Sean Franklin in the 92nd minute. United had led the league with 8 comeback victories during the regular season, so the comeback win was a fitting way to kick off the 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs.|$|E

The words he used were [...] "Shishak aor" [...] which is Turkish for [...] "to put on a skewer (as a shish kebab).

500|$|After {{directing}} the documentary A Place in Time (2007), which was distributed through the National Education Association, Jolie made her feature directorial debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), {{a love story}} between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner, set during the 1992–95 Bosnian War. She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors, after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina {{in her role as}} a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador. To ensure authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia—including stars Goran Kostić and Zana Marjanović—and incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly, even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>what's</b> onscreen." [...] The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war.|$|R
