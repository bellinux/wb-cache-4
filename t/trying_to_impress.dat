25|$|During the Lula {{administration}} (2003-2011), Brazil promoted an emphatic {{defense of}} the right of Iran, as an NPT signatory, to enrich uranium. While this action was in accordance with the argument usually put forward by Brazil – that affirms developing countries can acquire technology considered important for their national development – it represented a source of disagreement between Brazil and the United States. According to reports of then-Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and leaked U.S. diplomatic cables, the United States had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>impress</b> on Brazil the need to convince Iran to come to an agreement with the IAEA regarding its nuclear program. Following the U.S. requests, Brazilian diplomats, together with their Turkish counterparts, brokered an agreement with Iran which became public in May 2010. The deal was formalized via the tripartite Tehran Declaration that allowed Iran to send 1,200 kilograms of 3.5%-enriched uranium to Turkey in exchange for 20%-enriched nuclear fuel for a scientific reactor.|$|E

25|$|The pair meet Wichita (Emma Stone) and {{her younger}} sister Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) in a grocery store. The sisters are con artists, and trick Tallahassee and Columbus into handing over their weapons by pretending that Little Rock was {{infected}} by the disease, then steal their Escalade. The two men find a yellow Hummer H2 loaded with weapons and go after the sisters. However, the girls spring another trap for them and take them hostage. Tallahassee steals his gun back and has a stand-off with Wichita, until Columbus lashes out in anger that they have bigger problems to worry about, resulting in an uneasy truce between them. The sisters reveal {{that they are going}} to the Pacific Playland amusement park in Los Angeles, an area supposedly free of zombies.

25|$|En {{route to}} Richmond, Fremantle passed through Wilmington, North Carolina, and Petersburg, Virginia, before {{arriving}} in the Confederate capital two days after leaving Charleston. On {{the day of his}} arrival, he was granted a meeting with Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin. During the audience, Benjamin assured Fremantle that British diplomatic recognition of the C.S.A. would terminate the war without more bloodshed, though the British officer was concerned about a possible Union invasion of Canada. Benjamin also complained to his guest about revelations about his gambling habits made by the former correspondent of The Times, William Howard Russell. Benjamin then took Fremantle to see President Jefferson Davis, with whom he spoke for an hour. From Fremantle's account, it is possible to conclude that the Confederate leaders may have been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>impress</b> their British visitor on the matter of diplomatic intervention, without real consideration of his lack of power to do so.|$|E
25|$|When the ECW brand {{came to his}} end in February 2010, Ryder and Mendes {{moved to}} the Raw brand, making his debut on the February 25 episode of Superstars, {{defeating}} Primo. Ryder made his Raw debut on March 1, losing to Montel Vontavious Porter in a Money in the Bank qualifying match. He participated in an untelevised 26-man battle royal at WrestleMania XXVI, being the last person eliminated by the winner Yoshi Tatsu. Mendes was drafted to SmackDown {{as part of the}} 2010 Supplemental Draft without Ryder, so Ryder sought a new valet, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>impress</b> Alicia Fox and Gail Kim while they watched his matches at ringside. During a match with Evan Bourne on the May 10 episode of Raw, Fox attempted to interfere on Ryder's behalf but was stopped by Kim, leading to Bourne winning the match. The two new pairings faced off in a mixed tag team match on the May 17 episode of Raw, which Ryder and Fox lost. Ryder had a return win over Bourne on May 27's Superstars. The next week on Raw, Fox attacked Ryder with an axe kick after Raw guest host Ashton Kutcher put a bounty on Ryder's head. During the June 7 Viewer's Choice episode of Raw, Ryder was voted to team with the Miz, defeating John Morrison and R-Truth. The next week, Ryder had a title shot in a fatal four-way match for the United States Championship, but lost. Months later, in August, he was given a WWE Championship match against Sheamus that lasted 11 seconds, which was the second-shortest WWE Championship match in WWE history, in an attempt by Sheamus to circumvent the company's 30 day championship defence policy.|$|E

500|$|Michael Schiffer, one of {{the writers}} of the film Crimson Tide, {{is said to have}} enjoyed this episode.

The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "a fairly straightforward episode where the biggest laugh comes from Homer being able to talk to penguins and Bart <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>impress</b> his classmates by doing The Bartman." ...|$|E

500|$|To some reviewers, Satin {{appears to}} have had a {{political}} goal– [...] encouraging activists to establish common ground with ordinary North Americans {{on the basis of their}} shared confusion and humanity. [...] For example, Jackie Hooper, writing in The Province, argues that the purity of motives projected by many pacifist activists is unconvincing, and recommends Satin's more complex view: [...] "Satin's emigration wasn't dictated totally by his idealism. [...] More often than not, he talked himself into radical positions... as a result of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>impress</b> his peers or his girlfriend, or rebelling against middle-class parental authority". [...] Roy MacSkimming, book editor of the Toronto Star, says Satin portrayed himself as [...] "idealistic" [...] but also troubled and uncertain, wanting to fit in yet also longing to be unique.|$|E

500|$|Blink-182 {{was formed}} in Poway, California, a suburb outside of San Diego, in August 1992. Guitarist Tom DeLonge was {{expelled}} from Poway High for attending a basketball game drunk {{and was forced to}} attend another local school for one semester. At Rancho Bernardo High School, DeLonge performed at a Battle of the Bands competition, where he was introduced to drummer Scott Raynor. He also befriended Kerry Key, who too was interested in punk music. Key's girlfriend, Anne Hoppus, introduced her brother, bassist Mark Hoppus—who had recently moved from Ridgecrest to work at a record store and attend college—to DeLonge on August 1, 1992. The two clicked instantly and played for hours in DeLonge's garage, exchanging lyrics and co-writing songs—one of which became [...] "Carousel".

The end of this episode is an unconnected parody of the closing scene from [...]|$|E
500|$|Druckmann {{felt that}} players, {{specifically}} parents, {{would be able}} to relate to Joel's character and his bonding with Ellie. Baker believes that Joel discovers morality throughout the game's narrative, working out the difference between loss and sacrifice, and his true personality begins to show. Druckmann became intrigued by players who discussed Joel's morality, distinguishing him as a hero or villain; Druckmann felt that Joel was only [...] "a complex person who's made good and bad decisions", but allowed it to be open to interpretation. When auditioning for the role, Baker read a phrase on the character sheet that stated Joel had [...] "few moral lines left to cross", which became the [...] "anchor point" [...] to the character for him. Baker found great difficulty in filming the game's prologue, which features scenes with Joel and his daughter Sarah, portrayed by Hana Hayes. Upon later viewing of the first day of footage from the scene, Druckmann felt that it could still be improved. When filming the scene again, Druckmann explained to Baker how to perform it, and felt that it was the best take upon doing so. Though Baker initially found the take too [...] "mechanical", he retroactively realized that he had been previously <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>impress</b> audiences by his acting, and that it was [...] "not what the scene needed".|$|E
