40|$|The use of {{magnetic}} bearings allows rotor dynamic systems {{to be developed}} for high speed applications, including low pressure/vacuum environments. They provide an alternative to conventional journal, rolling element and gas bearings. The benefits of using magnetic bearings are well documented in terms of low friction operation, together with controllable dynamic characteristics such as stiffness and damping. Magnetic bearings are usually equipped with touchdown bearings to protect the system in cases of power failure, transient loadings, system faults or unexpected influences that may induce system control malfunction. A rotor assembly invariably exhibits residual unbalance due to manufacturing imperfections. The underlying unbalance forces have an influence of the rotor dynamics that arise from contact between a rotor and a <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearing.</b> When considered with the system dynamics, larger unbalance tends to increase {{the possibility that a}} rotor will be able to remain in persistent contact with a <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearing.</b> A system has therefore been developed in which the touchdown bearings may be actuated so as to induce the rotor to return to contact-free levitation. This paper provides an assessment of the <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearing</b> motions that will realistically achieve this goal...|$|E
40|$|It is now common {{practice}} to supplement a magnetic bearing with a <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearing</b> {{to protect the}} rotor and stator components. Rotor/touchdown bearing contact may arise from rotor drop, caused by power loss or emergency shutdown. This paper considers the control options that are viable when the magnetic bearing is still functional should contact arise from intermittent faults or overload conditions. The problem is that bi-stable rotor responses are possible, with and without contact. If rotor contact should become persistent, the desirable course of action is to destabilize the rotor response and induce a return to contact-free levitation. In order to achieve this, {{it is appropriate to}} gain an understanding of the rotor dynamic behavior. This is determined from analytical and simulated results to reveal suitable control actions. These may be applied through the magnetic bearing control system, or by activating the <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearing</b> through a separate control loop. The issue is that standard control action for a contact-free rotor state will not be appropriate for a rotor in persistent contact since the basic plants to be controlled are significantly different. The required control action should be activated only when contact is detected. The results demonstrate that appropriately phased synchronous forcing could destabilize synchronous forward rub responses. Alternatively, small whirl motions of a <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearing</b> could also be beneficial without disturbing the main magnetic bearing control loop...|$|E
40|$|The torque-limited <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearing</b> system (TLTBS) is {{a backup}} mechanical-bearing {{system for a}} {{high-speed}} rotary machine in which the rotor shaft is supported by magnetic bearings in steady-state normal operation. The TLTBS provides ball-bearing support to augment or supplant the magnetic bearings during startup, shutdown, {{or failure of the}} magnetic bearings. The TLTBS also provides support in the presence of conditions (in particular, rotational acceleration) that make it difficult or impossible to control the magnetic bearings or in which the magnetic bearings are not strong enough (e. g., when the side load against the rotor exceeds the available lateral magnetic force) ...|$|E
40|$|Glenn Research Center has {{completed}} the redesign of the D 1 flywheel module. The redesign includes a new rotor with a composite rim, motor/generator, <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearings,</b> sensors, and a magnetic actuator. The {{purpose of the}} relatively low cost module upgrade is to enable it to continuously operate throughout its speed range of 0 to 60, 000 RPM. The module {{will be used as}} part of a combined attitude control and bus regulation experiment...|$|R
40|$|Rotors {{supported}} by active magnetic bearings under contact-free levitation have many advantages, such as allowing near frictionless rotation and high rotational speeds. They also provide the designer {{the capability to}} achieve increased machine power density. However, magnetic bearings possess limited load capacity and operate under active control. Under certain operational conditions, the load capacity may be exceeded or a transient fault may occur. <b>Touchdown</b> <b>bearings</b> or bushes are required in such systems, from the operational and design points of view, to prevent contact between the rotor and stator laminations causing damage to the system. Rotor/touchdown bearing contact can occur in fault conditions and under external disturbances, even if the magnetic bearings are fully functional. If the rotor makes contact with the <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearings,</b> the ensuing rotor dynamics may result in transient or sustained contact dynamics. These dynamics involve transmitting a range of stresses under distortional strains. Such stresses occur under different contact modes, can be of very short or long duration, and can affect {{the life span of}} <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearings.</b> <b>Touchdown</b> <b>bearings</b> thus characterise significant safety and reliability aspects of active magnetic bearing systems. Maximisation of the performance and operational life of magnetic bearing systems dictates the need for minimisation of rotor/touchdown bearing contact. Magnetic bearing forces may have the capability to restore contact-free rotor levitation, though this will require appropriate control strategies to be devised. An understanding of the contact dynamics is required, together with the relationship between these and magnetic bearing control forces. In this thesis, rotor/touchdown bearing contact conditions are identified and investigated dynamically. An active magnetic bearing system with a long flexible rotor is considered. A nonlinear system model is employed, and a speed range covering three of the rotor’s critical frequencies is taken into account. Different types of transient and steady-state contact modes are identified, including non-persistent and persistent trapped contact modes of varying contact force levels and time durations. Design methodology is presented for a force measurement system capable of providing rotor/touchdown bearing contact force related data, based on experimental strain measurement. The system is implemented and a calibration method of assessing magnetic bearing forces based on rotor/touchdown bearing contact is demonstrated. The frequency dependent behaviour of the active magnetic bearing system is considered using evaluated force and phase measurements. Force measurements covering one of the rotor’s critical speeds are experimentally validated using an open-loop control strategy, aimed at attenuating rotor vibration in contact cases. Rotor recovery from a persistent rub contact mode through employing synchronous active magnetic bearing forces is demonstrated and discussed. The range of magnetic bearing control forces capable of contact elimination is also explored for different running speeds. The new control method presented provides insight into potential control methods capable of achieving rotor/touchdown bearing contact recovery utilizing experimental force data in contact conditions. This will contribute towards improving safety and reliability aspects of active magnetic bearing systems, which undergo operational conditions leading to rotor/touchdown bearing contact...|$|R

Finally, a matrix of the key technologies versus the various prototype designs is presented to show the current progress of inertial energy storage, and to show the direction of future work...|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{the novel}} {{dynamics}} arising in a nonlinear rotor dynamic system by investigating the discontinuity-induced bifurcations corresponding to collisions with the rotor housing (<b>touchdown</b> <b>bearing</b> surface interactions). The simplified Föppl/Jeffcott rotor with clearance and mass unbalance is modelled by a two {{degree of freedom}} impact–friction oscillator, as appropriate for a rigid rotor levitated by magnetic bearings. Two types of motion observed in experiments are {{of interest in this}} paper: no contact and repeated instantaneous contact. We study how these are affected by damping and stiffness present in the system using analytical and numerical piecewise-smooth dynamical systems methods. By studying the impact map, we show that these types of motion arise at a novel non-smooth Hopf-type bifurcation from a boundary equilibrium bifurcation point for certain parameter values. A local analysis of this bifurcation point allows us a complete understanding of this behaviour in a general setting. The analysis identifies criteria for the existence of such smooth and non-smooth bifurcations, which is an essential step towards achieving reliable and robust controllers that can take compensating action...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} for {{the recovery of}} contact-free levitation of a rotor supported by active magnetic bearings (AMB) is assessed through control strategy design, system modelling and experimental verification. The rotor is considered {{to make contact with}} a <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearing</b> (TDB), which may lead to entrapment in a bi-stable nonlinear response. A linear matrix inequality (LMI) based gain-scheduling H control technique is introduced to recover the rotor to a contact-free state. The controller formulation involves a time-varying effective stiffness parameter, which can be evaluated in terms of forces transmitted through the TDB. Rather than measuring these forces directly, an observer is introduced with a model of the base structure to transform base acceleration signals using polytopic coordinates for controller adjustment. Force transmission to the supporting base structure will occur either through an AMB alone without contact, or through the AMB and TDB with contact and this must be accounted for in the observer design. The controller is verified experimentally in terms of (a) non-contact robust stability and vibration suppression performance; (b) control action for contact-free recovery at typical running speeds with various unbalance and TDB misalignment conditions; and (c) coast-down experimental tests. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the AMB control action whenever it operates within its dynamic load capacity...|$|E
40|$|Design of a {{flywheel}} module, designated the G 2 module, is described. The G 2 flywheel is a 60, 000 RPM, 525 W-hr, 1 kW system {{designed for a}} laboratory environment; {{it will be used}} for component testing and system demonstrations, with the goal of applying flywheels to aerospace energy storage and integrated power and attitude control (IPACS) applications. G 2 has a modular design, which allows for new motors, magnetic bearings, touchdown bearings, and rotors to be installed without a complete redesign of the system. This design process involves several engineering disciplines, and requirements are developed for the speed, energy storage, power level, and operating environment. The G 2 rotor system consists of a multilayer carbon fiber rim with a titanium hub on which the other components mount, and rotordynamics analysis is conducted to ensure rigid and flexible rotor modes are controllable or outside of the operating speed range. Magnetic bearings are sized using 1 -D magnetic circuit analysis and refined using 3 -D finite element analysis. The G 2 magnetic bearing system was designed by Texas A&M and has redundancy which allows derated operation after the loss of some components, and an existing liquid cooled two pole permanent magnet motor/generator is used. The <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearing</b> system is designed with a squeeze film damper system allowing spin down from full operating speed in case of a magnetic bearing failure. The G 2 flywheel will enable module level demonstrations of component technology, and will be a key building block in system level attitude control and IPACS demonstrations...|$|E

The test was conducted using the D 1 flywheel module and the high-speed shaft (HSS) in the High Energy Flywheel Facility (HEFF). Both of these flywheel modules consist of a magnetically levitated rotor with an integral motor/generator, a vacuum housing, and mechanical <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearings.</b> Energy is stored kinetically in the rotor. The motor/generator allows energy {{to be added to}} or withdrawn from the rotor, and magnetic bearings and a vacuum enclosure are used to minimize losses...|$|R
40|$|As the {{actuators}} {{of active}} magnetic bearings (AMB) are open loop unstable a {{feedback control system}} is essential for their successful operation and for ensuring good performance. In addition, when rotor systems utilizing AMBs are operated at high speeds there will be synchronous vibrations due to unavoidable rotor mass unbalances, which generate synchronous disturbance forces. These forces and vibrations can often lead to severe problems in rotating machines including collision with the <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearings</b> at high speed and the possible risk of causing damage to the internal parts of the machines. In this paper, a new ''direct" adaptive feedforward algorithm is proposed for minimizing selected vibration performance measures {{which is based on}} the filtered-x LMS adaptive filter algorithm. This new adaptive algorithm has been used for adjusting the amplitude and phase of a synchronous signal injected at the summing junction of the bearing feedback control loop. The experimental results reported in this work show the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|A rotor {{supported}} on active magnetic bearings (AMBs) is levitated inside an air gap by electromagnets controlled in feedback. In {{the event of}} momentary loss of levitation due to an acute exogenous disturbance or external fault, reestablishing levitation may be prevented by unbalanced forces, contact forces, and the rotor’s dynamics. A novel robust control strategy is proposed for ensuring levitation recovery. The proposed strategy utilizes model-based μ-synthesis to find the requisite AMB control law with unique provisions {{to account for the}} contact forces and to prevent control effort saturation at the large deflections that occur during levitation failure. The proposed strategy is demonstrated experimentally with an AMB test rig. First, rotor drop tests are performed to tune a simple touchdown-bearing model. That model is then used to identify a performance weight, which bounds the contact forces during controller synthesis. Then, levitation recovery trials are conducted at 1000 and 2000 RPM, in which current to the AMB coils is momentarily stopped, representing an external fault. The motor is allowed to drive the rotor on the <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearings</b> until coil current is restored. For both cases, the proposed control strategy shows a marked improvement in relevitation transients...|$|R
40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearings (AMBs) {{are used}} in many high speed machinery applications because of their advantages of no contact, no wear, no need for lubrications and ability to operate in high rotational speeds. AMBs represent an alternative solution to traditional mechanical bearing due to their contactless working principle. Touchdown bearings are needed in AMBs to prevent system damage under certain conditions such as sudden impact or sudden change of unbalance. In these conditions, rotor may make contact with touchdown bearings. AMBs may {{have the capability to}} accommodate sudden impact without contact though this will require novel design of control strategy for thrust and <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearing.</b> The purpose of this work is to provide platform for the robust control design research of flexible rotor-AMB touchdown systems. To this end research work concentrates on the design, construction and simulation of magnetic thrust and touchdown system. The report begins with the identifications of flexible rotor AMB system configuration. In this content accurate rotor system model considering AMB, thrust and touchdown discs was obtained using FEM technique according to Timoshenko beam theory. Design of flexible rotor AMB system requires careful attention towards rotordynamic design aspect such as observability and controllability and it is important that actuator and sensor location are away from the nodal point. Identification of flexible rotor-AMB system model is achieved in a series of steps. Free-free undamped mode shapes were obtained in this work which predicts the dynamic behaviour of the flexible rotor. The plot of the free-free mode shapes and natural frequencies results have shown that the system is controllable and observable. Second, Campbell diagram was generated to see the effect of gyroscopic behaviour on the splitting of natural frequencies into forward and backword modes. Campbell diagram results showed satisfactory behaviour of flexible rotor. The second goal of this work is to acquire technical design, modelling of electromechanical components and control unit. Magnetic actuator design specifications were obtained based on magnetic circuit analysis. Unigraphics software was used to carry out detail design and 3 D modeling/assembly of electromechanical components. In this context purchase cost estimation was identified based on quotations. Purchase of rotor model components were made outside. The third goal of a thesis work is to verify the flexible rotor system model using experimental test. Hammer used as a force transducer was used in the test as excitation of the system and accelerometer used to measure response of the system. The experimental result validates the FEM technique because it is in reasonably good agreement with simulation results. The experimental mode shape results showed rotor will perform well within design speed range...|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} magnetically suspended composite flywheel {{energy storage}} (FES) system is operating at the University of Maryland. This system, designed for spacecraft applications, incorporates recent advances in the technologies of composite materials, magnetic suspension, and permanent magnet brushless motor/generator. The current system {{is referred to as}} an Open Core Composite Flywheel (OCCF) energy storage system. This paper will present design improvements for enhanced and robust performance. Initially, when the OCCF prototype was spun above its first critical frequency of 4, 500 RPM, the rotor movement would exceed the space available in the magnetic suspension gap and touchdown on the backup mechanical bearings would occur. On some occasions it was observed that, after touchdown, the rotor was unable to re-suspend as the speed decreased. Additionally, it was observed that the rotor would exhibit unstable oscillations when the control system was initially turned on. Our analysis suggested that the following problems existed: (1) The linear operating range of the magnetic bearings was limited due to electrical and magnetic saturation; (2) The inductance of the magnetic bearings was affecting the transient response of the system; (3) The flywheel was confined to a small movement because mechanical components could not be held to a tight tolerance; and (4) The location of the <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearing</b> magnifies the motion at the pole faces of the magnetic bearings when the linear range is crucial. In order to correct these problems an improved design of the {{flywheel energy storage}} system was undertaken. The magnetic bearings were re-designed to achieve a large linear operating range and to withstand load disturbances of at least 1 g. The external position transducers were replaced by a unique design which were resistant to magnetic field noise and allowed cancellation of the radial growth of the flywheel at high speeds. A central rod was utilized to ensure the concentricity of the magnetic bearings, the motor/generator, and the mechanical touchdown bearings. In addition, the mechanical touchdown bearings were placed at two ends of the magnetic bearing stack to restrict the motion at pole faces. A composite flywheel was made using a multi-ring interference assembled design for a high specific energy density. To achieve a higher speed and better efficiency, a permanent magnet DC brushless motor was specially designed and fabricated. A vacuum enclosure was constructed to eliminate windage losses for testing at high speeds. With the new improvements the OCCF system was tested to 20, 000 RPM with a total stored energy of 15. 9 WH and an angular momentum of 54. 8 N-m-s (40. 4 lb-ft-s). Motor current limitation, caused by power loss in the magnetic bearings, was identified as causing the limit in upper operating speed...|$|E

This paper describes the use of a contact force measurement system to establish the force relationship. The contact force components measured by the system are calibrated against forces applied by an active magnetic bearing.

40|$|There are machine {{operating}} regimes in which rotor/stator interactions {{may lead to}} problematic rotor dynamic behavior. For example, dynamic heat sources arising from seals, bearings and other rubbing stator components may cause rotor thermal bend instability. In active magnetic bearing (AMB) systems, the rotor may experience forward and backward whirl rubs with <b>touchdown</b> <b>bearings</b> (TDBs). In abnormal cases, rotor transient and bounce interactions with such bearings may involve highly localized and short duration contacts. This paper discusses certain contact phenomena that may occur in passive and active systems. For example, the rub induced spiral behavior arises {{from a combination of}} unbalance and a thermal input that moves slowly around the rotor, typically in passive rotor-bearing systems. However, the instability can be regarded as if arising from a closed-loop feedback system. Hence it is possible to analyze the phenomenon using techniques that have been developed for active control systems. Rotors levitated by AMBs are truly active, but there are fundamental issues that may arise when contact with TDBs occurs. AMB control and contact interactions are discussed together with the benefits for making the TDB an active element. The reason for this lies in the potential ability to control the contact dynamics and associated mechanical and thermal stresses. A prototype system is described...|$|R

40|$|The University of Texas Center for Electromechanics (UT-CEM) in {{association}} with the Texas A&M Vibration Control Lab (TAMU-VCL) has developed an active magnetic bearing control system for use in a 5 MW, 25 MJ, 20, 000 RPM flywheel alternator developed under the Combat Hybrid Power Systems (CHPS) program. The inside-out topology of this flywheel (i. e., the 650 lb (294 kg) flywheel rotor is positioned outside the stator) was dictated by the extreme power density and energy density requirements, and presented unique control challenges seldom encountered in conventional magnetic bearing applications. These challenges resulted from a large number of flexible modes in the rotor and stator, requiring a high-order flexible dynamic model and extensive rotordynamic analysis. A simulation-based design effort was implemented to accomplish the primary control objective: to provide robust, efficient magnetic levitation of the CHPS rotor over a wide range of operating speeds and disturbance inputs, while minimizing the occurrence of backup <b>bearing</b> <b>touchdowns.</b> Additionally, this design effort provided critical specifications for CHPS flywheel design and component selection.

40|$|For rotors {{supported}} by active magnetic bearings (AMBs), clearance bearings {{are commonly used}} to provide backup support under loss of AMB functionality. Test data from real machines shows that rotor vibration during <b>touchdown</b> on backup <b>bearings</b> may involve steady forward whirling at a subsynchronous frequency. This excitation {{is believed to be}} due to friction forces transmitted between the rotor and a bearing endface under axial load. This paper proposes a new analytical approach to model and predict such friction-driven forward whirl behaviors. A set of constraint equations are derived that relate a circular whirl motion of arbitrary orbital speed to the frequency response functions of the rotor-housing structure. This model is coupled with an evaluation of Coulomb friction associated with slip between the rotor and the supporting endface of a thrust bearing. The resulting equations can be used to compute a set of possible whirl motions via a root-finding procedure. A case study is undertaken for a 140 kW energy storage flywheel. Model-based predictions are compared with measured data from spin-down tests and show a good level of agreement. The study confirms the role of friction-related forces in driving forward-whirl response behaviors. It also highlights the key role of housing and machine support characteristics in response behavior. This influence is shown to be complex and not open to simple physical interpretation. Therefore, the proposed analytical method is seen as a useful tool to investigate this influence while avoiding the need for time consuming numerical simulations...|$|R
