5|$|Heritage turkey breeds {{have been}} a focus for the {{organization}} since 1997, when a survey showed only 1,335 breeding stock birds of all breeds. A {{study conducted by the}} Conservancy and Virginia Tech concluded that heritage turkey breeds had stronger immune systems than those breeds typically used by industrial growers, and as such were more likely to survive disease epidemics. This study and other programs increased awareness of heritage turkey breeds and by 2003 the breeding population stood at 4,275 turkeys of all breeds.

5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} in the cheetah is 38, {{the same as}} in most other felids (though for the ocelot and the margay <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> 36). A remarkable feature of the cheetah is its unusually low genetic variability in comparison to other felids. Consequently, individuals show considerable genetic similarity to one another, as illustrated by skin grafts, electrophoretic evidence and reproductive surveys. A prolonged period of inbreeding, following a genetic bottleneck during the last ice age, {{is believed to be the}} reason behind this anomaly. The consequences of such genetic uniformity might include a low sperm count, decreased sperm motility, deformed flagella, difficulty in captive breeding and susceptibility to disease.|$|E

5|$|Though {{molybdenum}} forms compounds {{with various}} organic molecules, including carbohydrates and amino acids, it is transported throughout {{the human body}} as MoO42−. At least 50 molybdenum-containing enzymes were known by 2002, mostly in bacteria, and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> increasing with every year; those enzymes include aldehyde oxidase, sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidase. In some animals, and in humans, the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid, a process of purine catabolism, is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, a molybdenum-containing enzyme. The activity of xanthine oxidase is directly proportional {{to the amount of}} molybdenum in the body. However, an extremely high concentration of molybdenum reverses the trend and can act as an inhibitor in both purine catabolism and other processes. Molybdenum concentration also affects protein synthesis, metabolism, and growth.|$|E

5|$|By {{the eighteenth}} century Catholicism {{had been reduced to}} the fringes of the country, {{particularly}} the Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands and Islands. Numbers probably reduced in the seventeenth century and organisation had deteriorated. Pope Innocent X appointed Thomas Nicolson as the first Vicar Apostolic over the mission in 1694. The country was organised into districts and by 1703 there were thirty-three Catholic clergy. Conditions grew worse for Catholics after the Jacobite rebellions and Catholicism was reduced to little more than a poorly run mission. In 1733 it was divided into two vicariates, one for the Highlands and one for the Lowlands, each under a bishop. There were six attempts to found a seminary in the Highlands between 1732 and 1838, all of which floundered on financial issues. Clergy entered the country secretly and although services were illegal they were maintained. In 1755 it was estimated that there were only 16,500 communicants, mainly in the north and west, although <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> probably an underestimate. By {{the end of the century}} this had probably fallen by a quarter due to emigration. The First Relief Act of 1778, was designed to bring a measure of toleration to Catholics, but a campaign led by Lord George Gordon, that resulted anti-Catholic riots in Scotland, known after him as the Gordon Riots, meant that it was limited to England. The provisions of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791, which allowed freedom of worship for Catholics who took an oath of allegiance, were extended to Scotland in 1793. In 1799 the Lowland District seminary was transferred to Aquhorthies, near Inverurie in Aberdeenshire, so that it could serve the entire country. It was secretly funded by the government, who were concerned at the scale of emigration by Highland Catholics.|$|E
5|$|Essential {{genes are}} {{the set of}} genes thought to be {{critical}} for an organism's survival. This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients {{and the absence of}} environmental stress. Only a small portion of an organism's genes are essential. In bacteria, an estimated 250–400 genes are essential for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of their genes. Half of these genes are orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of essential genes is slightly higher, at 1000 genes (~20% of their genes). Although <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential genes (~10% of their genes). The synthetic organism, Syn 3, has a minimal genome of 473 essential genes and quasi-essential genes (necessary for fast growth), although 149 have unknown function.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{only about}} 4% of {{patients}} with photosensitive disorders are reported to {{have been diagnosed with}} solar urticaria. Internationally, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> slightly larger at 5.3%. Solar urticaria may occur in all races but studies monitoring 135 African Americans and 110 Caucasians with photodermatoses found that 2.2% of the African Americans had SU and 8% of the Caucasians had the disease showing that Caucasians {{have a better chance of}} getting the disease. Globably 3.1 per 100,000 people are affected and females are more likely to be affected than males. The age ranges anywhere from 5–70 years old, but the average age is 35 and cases have been reported with children that are still in infancy. Solar urticaria accounts for less than one percent of the many documented urticaria cases. To put that into a better perspective, since its first documented case in Japan in 1916, over one hundred other instances of the disease have been reported.|$|E
5|$|Since {{there were}} no sitting justices at the {{beginning}} of Washington's term, he had the unique opportunity to fill the entire body of United States federal judges with his selections. Despite this, Washington appointed only 28 judges to the United States district courts, due to the smaller size of the judiciary at the time; there were far fewer states, most states had a single district court, and each district had a single judge assigned to it. Because intermediate federal appellate courts had not yet been established, this, combined with the Supreme Court appointments, constituted the total number of federal judicial appointments made by Washington. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> roughly 10% of the record 376 judges appointed by Ronald Reagan from 1980 to 1988, when the judiciary was much larger, and less than 5% of the number of active federal judges serving as of July 2010. Richard Peters, Jr. served for over 36 years, the longest of Washington's appointments.|$|E
5|$|The Arabs {{prepared}} a massive strike for 737, however, intended {{to end the}} war for good. Marwan apparently went to Damascus in person to persuade Hisham to back this project and was successful: an army 120,000 strong was assembled, comprising regular forces of Syria and the Jazira, as well as volunteers for the jihad, Armenian troops under Ashot Bagratuni, and even armed camp followers and servants. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> clearly an exaggeration, but whatever the real size of Marwan's army, it was a huge force and certainly the largest ever sent against the Khazars. Marwan first secured his rear by subduing the Armenian factions who were hostile to the Arabs and their client Ashot. He then pushed into Iberia, driving its Chosroid ruler to seek refuge in the fortress of Anakopia on the Black Sea coast, in the Byzantine protectorate of Abkhazia. Marwan laid siege to Anakopia itself, but he was forced to retire due to the outbreak of dysentery among his troops.|$|E

The defense gained 26 places in the pass defense category to end the season fourth in the ranking. While the unit also allowed only 225 passing yards per game, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> skewed due to opposing offenses' frequency to run the ball; Bears opponents passed 512, the fourth-least in the NFL. Yardage-wise, the defense allowed an average of 345.1, gaining 16 spots to finish 14th. Statistically, the Bears allowed 7.5 yards per pass and a 62.9 completion percentage, 20th- and 14th-ranked in the league, respectively. The pass defense also allowed a passer rating of 99.2 passer rating (26th), 31 touchdowns (25th), while recording only eight interceptions, the second-least in the NFL. In total, the Bears forced only 17 turnovers (28th-ranked), failing to record one in seven games, and twice in only two games. In the red zone, the Bears allowed 27 touchdowns and 14 field goals on 45 attempts (60 percent), which ranked 21st in the league. Meanwhile, the pass rush recorded 35 sacks (22nd in the NFL), 20 of which occurred in the last seven games of the year, the seventh-most in the league.|$|E
5|$|The hoard {{contains}} about 100 silver and silver-gilt items; <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> imprecise {{because there are}} unmatched broken parts.

The beaker and juglet are decorated with similar leaf and stem patterns, and the juglet has three gilded bands. In contrast, the small bowls and dish are plain, and it is presumed that {{the owners of the}} Hoard had many more such items, probably including the large decorated dishes found in other hoards.
