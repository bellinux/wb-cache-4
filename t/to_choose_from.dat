40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} effects of regulatory focus on alternative search and consideration set formation in consumer decision making. Results from three experiments yield two primary findings. First, promotion-focused consumers tend to search for alternatives at a more global level, whereas prevention-focused consumers tend to search for alternatives at a more local level. Second, promotion-focused consumers tend to have larger consideration sets than do prevention-focused consumers. Building on these two primary findings, it is additionally shown that whereas promotion-focused consumers attach relatively greater value <b>to</b> options <b>chosen</b> <b>from</b> hierarchically structured sets, prevention-focused consumers attach relatively greater value <b>to</b> options <b>chosen</b> <b>from</b> nonhierarchically structured item lists. Finally, whereas promotion-focused consumers attach significantly greater value <b>to</b> options <b>chosen</b> <b>from</b> larger sets than <b>to</b> options <b>chosen</b> <b>from</b> smaller sets, prevention-focused consumers do not attach significantly less value <b>to</b> options <b>chosen</b> <b>from</b> larger sets than <b>to</b> options <b>chosen</b> <b>from</b> smaller sets.

5|$|For his 1896 {{attempt to}} launch the balloon, Andrée had many eager volunteers <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>from.</b> He picked Nils Gustaf Ekholm (1848–1923), an {{experienced}} Arctic meteorological researcher and formerly his boss during an 1882–83 geophysical expedition to Spitsbergen, and Nils Strindberg (1872–97), a brilliant student who was doing original research in physics and chemistry.

This was a team with many useful scientific and technical skills, but lacking any particular physical prowess or training for survival under extreme conditions. All three men were indoor types, and only one, Strindberg, was young. Andrée expected a sedentary voyage in a balloon basket, and strength and survival skills were far down on his list.|$|E
