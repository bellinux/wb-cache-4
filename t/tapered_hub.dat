40|$|Presently, the {{majority}} of podded propulsion systems are of the pulling type, because this type provides better hydrodynamic efficiency than the pushing type. There are several possible explanations for the better overall performance of a puller type podded propulsor. One {{is related to the}} difference in hub shape. Puller and pusher propellers have opposite hub taper angles, hence different hub and blade root shape. These differences cause changes in the flow condition and possibly influence the overall performance. The current study focuses on the variation in performance of pusher and puller propellers with the same blade sections, but different hub taper angles. A hyperboloidal low order sourcedoublet steady/unsteady time domain panel method code was modified and used to evaluate effects of hub taper angle on the open water propulsive performance of some fixed pitch screw propellers used in podded propulsion systems. The modified code was first validated against measurements of two model propellers in terms of average propulsive performance and good agreement was found. Major findings include significant effects of hub taper angle on propulsive performance of <b>tapered</b> <b>hub</b> propellers and noticeable effects of hub taper angle on sectional pressure distributions of <b>tapered</b> <b>hub</b> propeller blades.

Puller and pusher propellers have opposite <b>hub</b> <b>taper</b> angles, hence different hub and blade root shapes. Results are presented here of an experimental study focused on the variation in performance of pusher and puller propellers with the same blade sections, but different <b>hub</b> <b>taper</b> angles, both in cavitating and noncavitating open water conditions. In {{the first phase of the}} study, three model propellers with different <b>hub</b> <b>taper</b> angles were tested in open water conditions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} effects of <b>tapered</b> <b>hub</b> on the propulsive characteristics of puller and pusher podded propulsors in straight course and static azimuthing conditions while operating in open water. The propulsive performance of two model pod units having the same pod-strut shape and propeller blade geometry with different hub shapes were measured using a custom designed pod dynamometer. The dynamometer system consisted of a six-component global dynamometer and a three-component pod dynamometer. The measurements consisted of the forces and moments of the units in the three co-ordinate directions and thrust and torque of the propellers for a range of advance coefficients from 0 to 1. 2 combined with the range of static azimuthing angles from + 300 to 2 ̆ 013300 in 150 increments in pusher and puller configurations. The variations in the propulsive performance due to the change in hub geometry in straight ahead conditions were examined first, followed by a study on the effects in different static azimuthing angles. Comparison {{of the results of the}} two pod units illustrated that in both pusher and puller configurations, the effect of hub taper angle is more significant at lower advance coefficients while the effects increased with increasing azimuthing angle.

40|$|This paper aims {{to predict}} the {{hydrodynamic}} forces on a propeller with different <b>hub</b> <b>taper</b> angles and a podded drive unit in azimuthing conditions. In order to evaluate the propulsive performance of the podded drive system, a Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) solver is employed. The method has been first verified by a single propeller with different <b>hub</b> <b>taper</b> angles. The performance curves of the propellers, obtained by numerical methods, have been compared to and validated with experimental results. In the next step, the method has been extended to the podded drive unit for both puller and pusher configurations. The yaw angles of the podded drives are set to vary from - 300 to + 300 with 50 increments. The propulsive characteristics, including the torque and thrust of the propeller, the axial force, and the side force of the unit are presented as functions of the advance velocity ratio and yaw angle. Computational results are compared to the available experimental data. Finally, it is shown there is good agreement between the experimental measurements {{and the results of}} the present numerical method. 9 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The experiments were conducted in the cavitation tunnel at Institute for Ocean Technology (IOT), NRC Canada. Four model propellers having the same blade sections but different hub geometry were designed and manufactured and tested at different cavitating conditions. The objective {{was to investigate the}} variations of propulsive performance and cavitation characteristics of the propellers because of different hub geometry. Tests were done in various combinations of flow velocity, propeller rotational speed and tunnel pressure. All of the propellers were tested {{in a wide range of}} advance coefficients and cavitation numbers to measure propeller thrust and torque. Reynolds Number effects on performance at design cavitation number, effect of <b>hub</b> <b>taper</b> angle on cavitation inception and comparison of performance under various cavitation conditions were investigated. The study gives a suitable basis for comparison of pusher and puller propellers? performance (propeller only case) under cavitating conditions.

An intermeshing rotor layout was chosen instead of a tail rotor design, following the examples of the 1939 Flettner Fl 265 and the Kellet XR-8 of 1944. Its twin, two blade rotors were driven by shafts which leaned out of the fuselage side-by-side. The rotor blades, which began some way from the <b>hub,</b> <b>tapered</b> strongly. Pitch and roll were adjusted from the control column by altering cyclic pitch via a pair of swashplates and yaw by changing the relative collective pitch of the two rotors with the pedals. Forward tilt of the rotor shafts was automatically linked to forward speed. A single lever controlled both the collective pitch and the throttle through an electrical link. The Abeille was powered by a [...] Renault 12S, an inverted, liquid-cooled V-12 engine.|$|R

An existing time domain panel method code was extended to handle the simulation tasks. The effect of taper angle was examined in terms of shaft thrust coefficient, KT, and torque coefficient, KQ, for different taper angles of - 150 (pull/tractor configuration) and + 150 (push configuration). The predicted pressure distribution was also analyzed to investigate the effect of taper ratio on pressure coefficient, Cp, at the blade root section. The effects of pod-strut geometry on KT and KQ of a propeller with taper angles of 150 and 200 with two pods both in push configuration were examined. A complementary experimental study {{of the effects of}} taper angle on propulsive performance was also conducted for 150 and 200 taper angles in push configuration.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} an experimental study {{of the effects of}} geometric parameters on the propulsive characteristics of puller-podded propulsors in straight course open water conditions. The geometry variations of the pod that encases the motor and shaft of a podded propulsor have been guided primarily by the size of available motors. As motor design becomes more flexible, the relationship of various geometric parameters with respect to performance becomes an important design consideration. There are a number of geometric parameters {{that can be used to}} optimize the design of a pod and five were chosen for the current study (pod diameter, length and taper length, strut distance from the propeller plane, and propeller <b>hub</b> <b>taper</b> angle). Tests with 16 different pod-strut combinations were done using a custom designed pod dynamometer, which consists of a six component global dynamometer and a three-component pod dynamometer. The system was used to measure the thrust and torque of the propellers, and forces and moments on the full unit. The aim was to identify the most significant geometric parameters that affect propeller thrust, torque and efficiency as well as unit thrust and efficiency in the puller configuration.

The numerical tool is an in-house panel method code, PROPELLA. The code is a low order source-doublet, steady/unsteady time domain panel method code having capabilities to predict hydrodynamic performance of screw propellers with various configurations. Under the research program, the code was extended and used to model the propellers, pod-strut combinations and strut-wake impingement model. Amongst the hydrodynamic issues that have been addressed through numerical predictions were questions regarding the effects of <b>hub</b> <b>taper</b> angle (propeller only case and pod-strut-propeller case), pod-strut configuration (push and pull), geometric variations, azimuthing conditions and pod-strut interactions (wake impingement effect) on podded propeller performance. Predictions were made both in pusher and puller configurations for the pods and reasonable agreement was achieved between the predictions and measurements. The code is being modified to study the podded propulsors' performance at static and dynamic azimuthing conditions. The code is also capable of performing simulations with propellers and bodies like ship hull, underwater vehicles with fins. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
