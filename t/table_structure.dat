2500|$|Several {{adjustments}} {{were made}} {{prior to the}} start of the 2010 season as Crljen was relieved [...] from his coaching duties to be replaced by Kreso Grnjto. The team went overseas to recruit several import signings like Ivan Å½gela, and Ante Zurak. Further changes saw the promotion of club secretary Pino Jazbec to the CSL Executive Committee as League Administrator. The CSL administration also restructured the league by combining both the International & National divisions to form the CSL First Division with a single <b>table</b> <b>structure.</b> Meanwhile the regular season was another unremarkable one for Croatia as the team barely qualified for the playoffs after securing the final berth by two points. In the opening round of the postseason Croatia achieved a remarkable result after defeating regular season champions York Region Shooters 3-1 on goals on aggregate. In the semifinals Toronto's season was cut short after a 2-0 defeat to Hamilton Croatia. One personal achievement went to Tihomir Maletic, who won the CSL Golden Boot, and MVP.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the work of}} building a large scale distributed ngram language model using a MapReduce platform named Hadoop and a distributed database called Hbase. We propose a method focusing on the time cost and storage size of the model, exploring different Hbase <b>table</b> <b>structures</b> and compression approaches. The method is applied to build up training and testing processes using Hadoop MapReduce frame-work and Hbase. The experiments evaluate and compare different <b>table</b> <b>structures</b> on training 100 million words for unigram, bigram and trigram models, and the results suggest a table based on half ngram structure {{is a good choice}} for distributed language model. The results of this work can be applied and further developed in machine trans-lation and other large scale distributed language processing areas. i Acknowledgements Many thanks to my supervisor Miles Osborne for the numerous advices, great supports and for inspiring new ideas about this project during our meetings.
