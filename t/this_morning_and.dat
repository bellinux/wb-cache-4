25|$|Daytime {{programming}} is also provided from 11:00a.m. to 3:00p.m. weekdays (with a one-hour break at 12:00p.m. Eastern/Pacific for stations to air newscasts, other locally produced programming such as talk shows, or syndicated programs) featuring the talk/lifestyle shows The View and The Chew and {{the soap opera}} General Hospital. ABC News programming includes Good Morning America from 7:00 to 9:00a.m. weekdays (along with one-hour weekend editions); nightly editions of ABC World News Tonight (whose weekend editions are occasionally subject to abbreviation or preemption due to sports telecasts overrunning into the program's timeslot), the Sunday political talk show This Week, early morning news programs World News Now and America <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>and</b> the late night newsmagazine Nightline.

25|$|When KDFW {{became a}} Fox {{affiliate}} on July 2, 1995, the station sharply expanded {{its emphasis on}} local news programming. It retained a news schedule {{similar to the one}} it had as a CBS affiliate, while increasing its news output from about 25 hours a week to nearly 40 hours (with its weekday news schedule expanding from 3½ hours to seven hours per day). In its early years with Fox, local news programming on the station ran on weekdays from 5:30 to 9:00a.m., 12:00 to 12:30p.m. and 6:00 to 6:30p.m., Saturday mornings, and nightly from 5:00 to 6:00p.m. and 9:00 to 10:30p.m. The weekday morning newscast's expansion from 1½ to three hours – {{with the addition of a}} two-hour extension from 7:00 to 9:00a.m.—and the consolidation of its half-hour weeknight 5:00 and 6:00p.m. newscasts into a single 90-minute block—although both programs were respectively structured as separate one-hour and half-hour broadcasts—filled timeslots vacated by the removals of CBS <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>and</b> the CBS Evening News from its schedule as Fox, unlike CBS, does not have daily national newscasts. Since Fox does not provide a third hour of network programming within its evening schedule, Channel 4 also added an hour-long prime time newscast at 9:00p.m. to lead into its existing 10:00p.m. newscast (KDFW is one of several Fox stations that offer newscasts in both the final hour of prime time and the traditional late news time slot—Fox Television Stations started to push news expansion into the latter in 2006—and one of ten that continued its Big Three-era late-evening newscast after switching to Fox; in contrast, Austin sister station KTBC aired syndicated programming as a lead-in for its existing 10:00p.m. newscast after it switched to Fox before it moved its late newscast to the 9:00p.m. hour in August 2000, that station would restore a late newscast in the former slot in September 2014).|$|E

500|$|Aguilera {{performed}} the song on television four times, {{first on the}} CBS <b>This</b> <b>Morning,</b> <b>and</b> then on the Donny & Marie show; neither of these performances were directed at her demographic of teen viewers. Whilst watching the show on This Morning, Aguilera gained the attention of songwriter Diane Warren, who was astonished by such a young performer being as [...] "polished" [...] as she was. Warren later stated {{that she had seen}} the potential in Aguilera. The singer also performed [...] "Reflection" [...] on MuchMusic's Intimate and Interactive on May 17, 2000. An ABC special in 2000, featuring a performance of the song, was recorded and released in a DVD titled My Reflection.|$|E

The accompanying music video {{was released on}} 31 January 2013. Filmed backstage at the group's DNA Tour and on their tour bus, it shows the group bonding with each other. Met with mixed reviews, critics likened it to Spice Girls' 1997 music video, [...] "Mama". Little Mix have performed [...] "Change Your Life" [...] on television shows Dancing on Ice, The Graham Norton Show and <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>and</b> during their DNA Tour (2013).|$|E

500|$|Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided. Less {{than a month}} later, on 20 June 1837, William IV {{died at the age}} of 71, and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom. In {{her diary}} she wrote, [...] "I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told me the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished to see me. I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my {{dressing}} gown) and alone, and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> consequently that I am Queen." [...] Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria, but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again.|$|E
500|$|Soon after Bannister {{pronounced}} Hendrix dead, {{a hospital}} spokesperson told the press: [...] "We don't know where, how, or why he died, but {{he died of}} an overdose." [...] By that evening, many newspapers in London and New York had printed sensationalized headlines that exploited the death-from-overdose account. Hendrix's public relations manager, Les Perrin, granted an interview on Dutch radio soon after the hospital announcement. He commented: [...] "Well, all I know is that Mr. Hendrix's body was taken to St. Mary Abbots Hospital in Kensington, London, at 11:45 <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> he was certified to be dead on arrival." [...] At 2 p.m., BBC Radio 1 reported: [...] "Jimi Hendrix, regarded by millions {{as one of the}} most talented and original performers in modern rock music, is dead." [...] That evening, The New York Times described him as [...] "a genius black musician, a guitarist, singer and composer of brilliantly dramatic power. He spoke in gestures and big as he could imagine and create." ...|$|E
500|$|McEntee {{took her}} {{seat in the}} Dáil on 16 April 2013, where she {{received}} a standing ovation upon entering the debating chamber, and was welcomed by Taoiseach Kenny, {{as well as other}} political leaders. She described taking up the seat vacated by her father as [...] "a huge honour", and said that it was an [...] "emotional day for all the McEntee family". The Irish Independent later reported that she had [...] "impressed many... manner and choice of words to the media as she arrived at Leinster House. 'I drove down to the graveside <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> had a few words. I think he [...] called into Michael Collins the morning of his first day, so I called into my hero.'" [...] McEntee gave her maiden speech to the Dáil on 8 May 2013, during a debate about that year's fodder shortage caused by cold spring weather, praising Agriculture Minister Simon Coveney's handling of the issue. She was subsequently appointed to the Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications, and the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.|$|E

500|$|Blair {{recorded}} {{a series of}} promotional interviews for radio and television for, among others, the Arabic television network Al Jazeera, the ITV1 daytime magazine programme <b>This</b> <b>Morning,</b> <b>and</b> BBC Two, which aired an hour-long interview with the journalist and political commentator Andrew Marr. He was in Washington, D.C. {{on the day of}} the UK launch to participate in peace talks with Middle East leaders and attend a White House dinner with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Israeli and Palestinian leaders. The British newspaper The Independent reported that Blair's visit to the United States was a coincidence, and not an attempt to be out of the United Kingdom when the book was published. When Blair arrived for his first book signing at a leading bookshop on O'Connell Street, Dublin on 4 September, demonstrators heckled, jeered and threw eggs and shoes at him. One activist posed as a purchaser to attempt a citizen's arrest of Blair for war crimes. Protestors clashed with Irish police and tried to push over a security barrier outside the shop. The demonstrators—anti-war protestors and Irish republicans opposed to the peace process—called queuing customers [...] "traitors" [...] and [...] "West Brits". Four people were arrested during the incident.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} immediately after Johnston finished the Britain's Got Talent live tour over a six-week period in London. The track listing, which contained both religious and popular songs, {{was chosen by}} Cowell; Johnston said [...] "I hadn't sung many of the tracks before. But I knew them all and, anyway, I like a challenge." [...] Johnston described recording the album as [...] "great", and said [...] "All I’ve ever wanted {{to do is go}} into a studio and record an album and it was everything I’ve ever dreamed of." [...] Johnson recorded [...] "Walking in the Air" [...] as a duet with fellow Britain's Got Talent contestant Faryl Smith, and the song was tipped as a potential Christmas number-one. The recording was finished by September 2008, after which Johnston began to make appearances to publicise the release, including appearances on GMTV, Channel 5 News, BBC Breakfast, <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>and</b> Radio 2's Friday Night Is Music Night. In preparation for the album's promotion, Johnston received confidence tutoring. He said that [...] "I've got no confidence and sometimes people get on at me for being moody so I've had some help with that." [...] Johnston also received vocal training from Yvie Burnett, who was, at the time, coaching Leona Lewis and Leon Jackson, and with whom Smith trained during Britain's Got Talent. The album was produced by Nigel Wright.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Lorrainers," [...] as the occupying {{forces were}} dubbed, were popularly loathed. The Viceroy, the Prince de Craon, whom the Electress disliked for his [...] "vulgar" [...] court, allowed the Electress to live {{undisturbed}} {{in her own}} wing of the Pitti, living in virtual seclusion, only on occasion receiving a select-number of guests under a black dais in her silver-clad audience room. She occupied herself financing and overseeing {{the construction of the}} Cappella dei Principi—started in 1604 by Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany—to the tune of 1,000 crowns per week, and she donated much of her fortune to charity: £4,000 per annum. [...] This is equivalent to £ in present-day terms. On 18 February 1743, Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, Dowager Electress Palatine, died of an [...] "oppression on the breast". Sir Horace Mann, 1st Baronet, a British resident in Florence, recalled in a letter that [...] "The common people are convinced she went off in a hurricane of wind; a most violent one began <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> lasted for about two hours, and now the sun shines as bright as ever..." [...] The royal line of the House of Medici became extinct with her death. Her will, having been completed just months before, according to Sir Horace Mann, left £500,000 worth of jewellery to the Grand Duke Francis and her lands in the former Duchy of Urbino to the Marquis Rinuccini, her main executor and a minister under her father, Cosimo III. She was interred in the crypt that she helped to complete in San Lorenzo; although not entirely finished {{at the time of her}} death, her testament stipulated that part of the revenue of her estate should [...] "be used to continue, finish and perfect...the said famous chapel San Lorenzo".|$|E
