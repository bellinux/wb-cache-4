500|$|Motley {{and fellow}} black {{teammate}} Bill Willis contended with racism throughout their careers. Although the color barrier was broken in all major American sports by 1950, the men endured shouted insults {{on the field}} and racial discrimination off of it. [...] "They found out that while they were calling us niggers and alligator bait, I was running for touchdowns and Willis was knocking <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> them," [...] Motley once said. [...] "So they stopped calling us names and started trying to catch up with us." [...] Focused exclusively on winning, Brown did not tolerate racism within the team.|$|E
500|$|Del Toro {{acknowledged}} this message's simplicity, {{but said}} {{he would have liked to}} have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child. The film's ten primary characters all have [...] "little arcs" [...] conducive to this idea; del Toro stated: [...] "I think that's a great message to give kids… 'That guy you were beating <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ten minutes ago? That's the guy you have to work with five minutes later.' That's life… We can only be complete when we work together." [...] The director noted that Hellboy and The Devil's Backbone told the same message, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way.|$|E
500|$|MacFarlane is {{passionate about}} {{his support for}} gay rights. In 2008 he called it [...] "infuriating and idiotic" [...] that two gay {{partners}} [...] "have {{to go through this}} fucking dog and pony act when they stop at a hotel and the guy behind the counter says, 'You want one room or two?'" [...] He went on to say, [...] "I'm incredibly passionate about my support for the gay community and what they're dealing with at this current point in time". MacFarlane continued, [...] "Why is it that Johnny Spaghetti Stain in fucking Georgia can knock a woman up, legally be married to her, and then beat <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her, but these two intelligent, sophisticated writers who have been together for 20 years can't get married?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Eventually, Ortiz pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the match}} by not showing up {{the day of}} the weigh-ins. In 2014, White even stated in an {{interview}} that [...] "I used to beat <b>the</b> living <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Tito Ortiz." ...|$|R
5000|$|The band Caroline's Spine {{released}} a song, called [...] "Good Afternoon", on their 1994 album ...So Good Afternoon, which mentions the beatings by saying: [...] "I think I'll try my look at Flo and Normanie {{and have some}} dude beat <b>the</b> living <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me".|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} {{version of the}} song (directed by Marc Webb) seems to have some added audio. During and onwards the lyrics [...] "They say all {{teenagers}} scare <b>the</b> living <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me", there are piano notes playing in the background {{in the style of}} western music (during live performances, the piano plays along to the music even more so). The album version of the song does not have this piano playing until the coda.|$|R
500|$|Pretty on the Inside {{has had an}} {{influence}} on multiple alternative rock acts, being specifically mentioned by Spinnerette frontwoman Brody Dalle in an interview as a seminal album {{in the development of}} her music. British rock band Nine Black Alps also noted the album as a major influence on their third release, Locked Out from the Inside (2009), and indie singer-songwriter Scout Niblett cited it as a major influence on her: [...] "For me, the thing that I loved about them and her [...] was the anger, and aggressiveness, along with the tender side", said Niblett. [...] "That was something I hadn't seen before in a woman playing music. That was hugely influential and really inspiring. Women up 'til then were kind of one-dimensional, twee, sweet, ethereal, and that annoys <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me." ...|$|E
500|$|Although The Marble Index was {{generally}} unnoticed {{when it was}} released, it was praised by the countercultural East Village Other and International Times; however, most critics found [...] "her desolate soundscapes inaccessible." [...] Anne Marie Micklo of Rolling Stone gave the album a positive review, calling side two [...] "a really worthwhile venture into musical infinity". A cult following emerged around it, which included music journalist Lester Bangs, who wrote in a 1978 article entitled [...] "Your Shadow Is Scared of You: An Attempt Not to Be Frightened by Nico": [...] "The Marble Index is the greatest piece of 'avant-garde classical', 'serious' music of {{the last half of}} the 20th century so far." [...] Although Bangs praised the album, he also wrote that it [...] "scared <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> [...] " [...] and described the listening experience as [...] "self-torture".|$|E
500|$|The period {{following}} Enema of the State saw {{the band}} experience great transition. [...] "We {{had gone from}} playing small clubs and sleeping on people's floors to headlining amphitheaters and staying in five-star hotels," [...] recalled Hoppus in 2013. [...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew who we were, and listened to what we were saying... it scared <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> us." [...] The band was rushed into recording the follow-up, as according to DeLonge, [...] "the president of MCA was penalizing us an obscene amount of money because our record wasn't {{going to be out}} in time for them to make their quarterly revenue statements. [...] And we were saying, 'Hey, we can't do this right now, we need to reorganize ourselves and really think about {{what we want to do}} and write the best record we can.' They didn't agree with us." ...|$|E
50|$|Shitkicker smashes {{open the}} front door of the police station and enters. The rooftop {{survivors}} make their way to the jail, where Hobo attempts to kill them, but literally gets <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> beaten <b>out</b> <b>of</b> him by the biker girls, spreading all over his legs. Greg reveals that Slasher has a lot of used cars that the survivors can use to escape. Shitkicker is accidentally shot in the head by Secrets. The gunshot alerts the monsters, who enter the police station. The group then decides to run to the used car lot.|$|R
5000|$|Thom {{has been}} the subject of {{criticism}} by many artists within the recording world, most notably from Lily Allen, The Fratellis and The Automatic. James Frost and Robin Hawkins from The Automatic stated that [...] "If she was a punk rocker with flowers in her hair she'd get <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> kicked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her by other punk rockers, for having flowers in her hair. ... I haven't found anyone who's told me they like that song and bought it." [...] Charlie Brooker also heavily criticised the intense public relations efforts to make the single popular.|$|R
2500|$|Coleman {{made his}} first UFC Heavyweight Championship title defense at UFC 14, facing kickboxer (and heavy underdog) Maurice Smith. In the pre-fight {{interview}} with Joe Rogan, coleman stated [...] "I'm going to ground him and pound <b>the</b> goddamn <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> him" [...] thus coining the name ground-and-pound. In {{what turned out to}} be a long battle, Coleman lost a decision after 21:00 (regulation plus two overtimes). This was considered to be one of the largest upsets in UFC history at that time, largely because of the way Coleman had dominated his opponents in his previous fights.|$|R
500|$|During {{the song}} [...] "The Electric Co.", Bono left {{the stage and}} climbed up a {{lighting}} rig to display a white flag. In a 2004 interview, the Edge said that Bono [...] "scared <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> [...] " [...] by climbing onto the rig and risking electrocution by the live wires in close proximity. Bono said [...] "good night" [...] to the crowd on nearly {{a half a dozen}} occasions so that the post-production crew would have several choices of songs with which to end the film. Backstage, the band members were disappointed that the crowd did not initially chant [...] "how long to sing this song?" [...] after the band had left the stage following the final song, [...] "40", which had become a tradition. However, tour manager Dennis Sheehan hid underneath the crowd barrier and began singing the refrain into a microphone without being asked. Eventually, the crowd joined in; the film was edited to disguise the fact that the singing was organised.|$|E
500|$|Hordern was a self-confessed [...] "lazy bugger" [...] {{when it came}} to role preparation. He did not regret {{his lack}} of formal acting training, and {{attributed}} his abilities to watching and learning from other actors and directors. He said: [...] "I am bored of the intellectual view of the theatre. Actually, it scares <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me, my view being that an actor should learn the lines without too much cerebral interference." [...] In 1951, he asked Byam Shaw how best to rehearse unfamiliar roles. [...] The director advised him to [...] "never read up on them" [...] before going on to say [...] "read the plays as much as [...] but never read the commentators or critics". It was advice which Hordern adopted for the role of King Lear, {{and for the rest of}} his career. The critic Brian McFarlane, writing for the British Film Institute, said that Hordern, despite his relaxed attitude, [...] "had one of the most productive careers of any 20th century British actor".|$|E
500|$|At age 10, Ryder and {{her family}} moved on again, this time to Petaluma, California. During her first week at Kenilworth Junior High, she was bullied {{by a group of}} her peers who mistook her for an effeminate, scrawny boy. [...] "I was wearing an old Salvation Army shop boy’s suit. As I went to the {{bathroom}} I heard people saying, ‘Hey, faggot’. They slammed my head into a locker. I fell to the ground and they started to kick <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me. I had to have stitches. The school kicked me out, not the bullies... Years later, I went to a coffee shop and I ran into one of the girls who’d kicked me, and she said, ‘Winona, Winona, can I have your autograph?’ And I said, ‘Do you remember me? Remember in seventh grade you beat up that kid?’ And she said, ‘Kind of’. And I said, ‘That was me. Go fuck yourself.’" [...] As a result, Ryder ended up being home-schooled that year.|$|E
2500|$|Regan Starr {{appeared}} in Rough Sex 2. According to her, [...] "I got <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> kicked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me."

[...] "I was being hit and choked". [...] "I was really upset, and they didn't stop". [...] "They kept filming". [...] "You can hear me say, 'Turn the fucking camera off', and they kept going". Director of the Rough Sex series Khan Tusion has commented that Starr [...] "categorically misstates what occurred." ...|$|R
5000|$|From Parts Unknown was {{recorded}} {{over the course}} of a month with Kurt Ballou of Converge at GodCity Studio in Salem, Massachusetts in March 2014. Vocalist Keith Buckley said Ballou [...] "always intimidated <b>the</b> living <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me, so I was overjoyed when the decision was made to record our next record with him". Buckley said that working with Ballou was [...] "stressful in the best way, like when your dad comes to watch you play baseball for the first time and you just want to make him proud". Ballou challenged the band to push themselves to make heavy but catchy songs. Buckley had attracted laryngitis, which had caused him to track the majority of his vocals in one day.|$|R
5000|$|Back in San Francisco, Sunshine {{had been}} leading an acid-jazz band. When it needed a vocalist, {{he took on}} Moonbeam in 1990. ("I didn't want to meet anybody named Moonbeam," [...] Sunshine says. [...] "I had <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> beaten <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me for my name.") Inspired by Ibiza, he tried to {{transform}} his group into a live house-music act. Many of the band members bailed, leaving just Sunshine and Moonbeam {{to go it alone}} as Dubtribe. At first, it was a grind trying to get booked in a DJ-centric world, but the duo's DIY Come Unity events at the Bryant Street pad (the first event was a rent party) were a hit, and soon Dubtribe was making records.|$|R
500|$|In {{their second}} game, the Browns faced the Chicago Rockets at Soldier Field before {{a crowd of}} 51,962 people, an {{attendance}} record for a professional football game in Chicago. It {{was the first of}} many games during which Cleveland's two black players, Marion Motley and Bill Willis, endured racially charged verbal and physical abuse. Some of their white teammates, including Lou Rymkus, retaliated by dealing their own cheap shots. Motley opened the scoring with a 20-yard run for a touchdown, the first in his career. Lou Groza added two field goals in the third quarter, and halfback Don Greenwood ran for a 41-yard touchdown to make the final score 20–6. Chicago's only points came on a touchdown run by Billy Hillenbrand on the first play of the fourth quarter. Motley later said that racism on the field stopped after opponents saw how well he and Willis played: [...] "They found out that while they were calling us niggers and alligator bait, I was running for touchdowns and Willis was knocking <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> them. So they stopped calling us names and started trying to catch up with us." ...|$|E
500|$|On Frohman's arrival, Ravenholm is {{depicted}} as a peaceful, bright, and cheerful place devoid of any Combine elements, but [...] "terrorized" [...] by Father Grigori. After adjusting, Gordon becomes accustomed to the town, but unintentionally discloses the town's location to Dr. Breen, who immediately orders his forces to [...] "bomb <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> them". The town is fired on with headcrabs, killing many and turning others into zombies. Frohman himself is attacked by a headcrab and turns into a zombie too, yet retains his free will; {{and after a while}} his headcrab dies of malnutrition, which is attributed to his lack of intelligence. With Father Grigori's help, Frohman escapes Ravenholm, now the zombie-infested nightmare seen when Freeman visits it in the game, and presses on to Nova Prospekt. After surviving several more hazards, he reaches the coast. Here, after passing the final resistance base and an Antlion-infested beach, Frohman encounters an Antlion Guard, which is killed by a Vortigaunt, an alien race helping the humans in the game. This allows Frohman to retrieve bugbait from the dead creature, with which he can control the Antlions.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was divided, as reviews ranged from largely positive to negative. In the book The End and the Beginning: The Official Guide to The X-Files, Vol. 5, author Andy Meisler {{noted that some}} fans and critics responded positively to [...] "The Beginning," [...] most notably because the episode functioned as [...] "a particularly artful and effective way to launch the series's new season—and era." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, saying [...] "'The Beginning' {{was a pretty good}} premiere episode. I was quite pleased to see how Chris Carter took last season's finale and the movie and tied things together to get Season 6 off to a fresh start." [...] Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave it a B. He praised the performance of Chris Owens, noting that he was [...] "acting <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Spender". Despite this, however he called the episode [...] "lackluster" [...] and noted that it [...] "isn’t a great episode of the show, but it works well enough". VanDerWerff's main issue with the entry was that it chose to close off the events of the fifth season finale, but did little to expand upon the revelations of the series' feature film. VanDerWerff also criticized the fact that Scully was, once again, a skeptic in the paranormal after all she saw.|$|E

Up until then, I was so sick and didn't even know I was sick... I {{realized}} that the alcohol and the drugs were just a symptom. The symptom became a problem, absolutely, {{but it was still}} just a symptom. I had {{to get rid of the}} symptom to get to the real stuff, which is really a spiritual sickness.

5000|$|The first {{recordings}} of the new and improved Turbonegro were the Denim Demon and Bad Mongo singles {{in the spring of}} 1995. That summer, Turbonegro left for their second attempt at a U.S. tour, [...] "Namblin in the 90's". They played only 11 shows. In the words of Happy-Tom, [...] "at least we didn't get <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> kicked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> us like we did the last time we were in the USA". In the fall of 1995, Bingo and Pål left the band, putting Turbonegro on hold. Pål wanted to travel, while Bingo didn't like the new musical direction ("less Slayer, more rock'n'roll.") Happy-Tom, at the same time, was suffering from stress injuries to his arms after the U.S. tour. Therefore, agreements were made to put the band on hold for a while.|$|R
5000|$|Continuing {{to seek a}} {{fighting}} career, Mercer opted to travel to Japan and challenged Musashi in the kickboxing combat sport K-1 on June 6, 2004. Mercer held a reasonable account of himself, but his age and inability to successfully defend kicks was evident as {{he went on to}} lose the bout via unanimous decision. On March 19, 2005, he had one more K-1 bout against Remy Bonjasky, to whom he lost via verbal submission, the first and only strike of the night, a head kick, would land on the square on the head of Mercer. It wasn't your typical fight; Mercer took one head kick and then quit in what {{was one of the most}} bizarre fights of all time as the kick didn't even seem to hurt him.

500|$|American pressmen {{had been}} alerted to an {{upcoming}} Buddhist demonstration {{to coincide with}} Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda {{in the north of}} Saigon. The group, which included Arnett, Browne, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhists filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngô Đình Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around [...] taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying [...] "Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> you!" [...] Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face. The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diệm's regime, with the images of the burning Thích Quảng Đức on the front pages still fresh {{in the minds of the}} public.|$|E

It's been a long, evolutionary process, but I think it's safe to say that we are now a threesome. We've taken on a keyboardist named Lucian, who is really quite a bizarre character.

Carlos went mad and {{attempted}} to attack John but it looked like he was attacking Justin - the gay person he beat up previously. Carlos was then arrested. While discussing the courtroom scene in which Carlos attacks John, Ricardo Antonio Chavira commented: [...] "People can see the full rage that is in my character.
