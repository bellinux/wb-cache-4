Nichiren Shoshu Soka Gakkai was no longer considered a lay group, or hokkekō, of Shōshū, and its leaders, including Ikeda, were expelled.

It is a metaphor for resisting evil, for dispelling darkness and for compassion to others. Diwali is the celebration of this inner light over spiritual darkness, of knowledge over ignorance and right over wrong. It is a festive restatement of the Hindu belief that the good ultimately triumphs over evil.|$|E

After defeating Washington-Lee 44-20, South Lakes 24-13, and Lake Braddock 31-7, Westfield would face South County for the region championship.

500|$|The final movement, [...] "", [...] is a chaconne, a form {{which is}} {{typically}} constructed over a repeated ground bass. Bach uses a ground bass which is possibly a borrowing from Pachelbel. It is the inversion of the chromatic fourth ostinato {{from the opening}} movement. Bach's orchestration includes strumming effects which {{could be seen as}} recalling the origin of the chaconne in Spanish guitar music. From a theological point of view, both the inversion of the lamento bass and the series of modulations in this movement express in baroque musical affect how Christ leads from sorrow <b>to</b> <b>joy.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} anthem of the Copa Libertadores is {{a section}} of Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125 [...] "Choral".

500|$|During {{the late}} 1960s Tippett {{worked on a}} series of {{compositions}} that reflected the influence of his American experiences after 1965: The Shires Suite (1970), The Knot Garden (1970) and the Symphony No. 3 (1972). [...] In The Knot Garden Mellers discerns Tippett's [...] "wonderfully acute" [...] ear only intermittently, otherwise: [...] "thirty years on, the piece still sounds and looks knotty indeed, exhausting alike to participants and audience". The Third Symphony is overtly linked by Tippett to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony through a vocal finale of four blues songs, introduced by a direct quotation from Beethoven's finale. Tippett's intention, explained by the music critic Calum MacDonald, was to explore the contemporary relevance of the grand, universal sentiments in Schiller's Ode <b>to</b> <b>Joy,</b> as set by Beethoven. [...] Tippett's conclusion is that while the need to rejoice remains, the twentieth century has put paid to the Romantic ideals of universality and certainty.|$|E
60|$|It isn't {{often that}} Peter Rabbit is truly envious, but {{sometimes}} in the joyousness of spring he is. He envies the birds because they can pour out in beautiful song the joy that is in them. The only way he can express his feelings is by kicking his long heels, jumping about, and such foolish things. While that gives Peter {{a great deal of}} satisfaction, it doesn't add <b>to</b> the <b>joy</b> of other people as do the songs of the birds, and you know <b>to</b> give <b>joy</b> <b>to</b> others is to add <b>to</b> your own <b>joy.</b> So there are times when Peter wishes he could sing.|$|R

[...] Bill Bowes described how, when he was bowling, he would glare and mutter under his breath; he seemed to be [...] "filled with a devilish energy". He would make sharp or biting comments, particularly if a fielder made a mistake when he was bowling and although often amusing, it could at times hurt the recipients, and his anger made his team-mates wary of him. Yet, he could also express appreciation when a skillful batsmen hit a good shot from his bowling; the result was that his colleagues were never sure what to expect from him, even after playing with him for years. Herbert Sutcliffe said he could be charming when not playing, but his wit could be sharp. Robertson-Glasgow nevertheless described him as [...] "a glorious opponent; a great cricketer; and a companion in a thousand".|$|E

The Guardians official website named them an indie-pop band, stating [...] "they made promising, if unremarkable, Franz Ferdinand-styled pop with cheeky chappy lyrics". In {{an interview with}} BBC London, they cited Talking Heads as a major influence. White Lies' darker sound has been primarily compared <b>to</b> <b>Joy</b> Division, Interpol and Editors, as well as Arcade Fire, The Killers, Echo & the Bunnymen, Tears for Fears and The Teardrop Explodes. McVeigh's singing voice {{has been compared to}} that of Ian Curtis and Julian Cope. When asked about the comparisons in an interview with ITN Music, McVeigh stated that [...] "We weren't alive during that period of music...we've never really been that into Joy Division, especially not the Editors...or even Interpol really", adding [...] "I don't think our music sounds a whole lot like those comparisons, I think we're a lot more euphoric and uplifting". As White Lies, the band have reiterated the influence of Talking Heads, both musically and in songwriting. As well as this, the band have stated that The Secret Machines are one of their main influences. In a commentary on a [...] "Track by Track" [...] interview on Spotify, one band member said that the band was influenced by The Cars, specifically how their guitar riffs on [...] "Be Your Man" [...] from the [...] "Big TV" [...] album was influenced by The Cars song [...] "Just What I Needed".|$|E
