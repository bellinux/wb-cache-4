The review presents objective techniques, subjective techniques along with their physiological background, and a combination of techniques {{as well as a}} new biomechanical approach called modelling of skin. The structure of the paper is as follows: definitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> textiles, including <b>the</b> authors' definition; objective techniques <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> measurement; physiological approach; subjective techniques <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> measurement; combination <b>of</b> objective and subjective techniques; modelling techniques and the biomechanics approach for measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> textiles; division <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> measurement techniques according to the authors.
