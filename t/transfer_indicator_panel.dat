A representative dataset of 112 Dutch small firm owners, who sold their firm in 2005 and 2006, is analyzed. Hierarchical multiple regressions show that specific human capital, like flexibility, social skills and market awareness predict transfer performance better than generic human capital like general education. Results also indicate that succession planning in business transfers is unrelated to the objective <b>transfer</b> performance <b>indicators</b> <b>transfer</b> duration and obtained price.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature by using propensity score matching to test for causal effects of starting to export on firm performance in Croatian manufacturing firm-level data. The results confirm that exporters have characteristics superior to those of non-exporters. In the main sample specification there is pervasive evidence of self-selection into export markets, meaning that firms are successful years before they become exporters. Using multiple firm performance <b>indicators,</b> <b>panel</b> and cross section data models together with various sample specifications there is scant evidence on learning-by-exporting which holds true only in a few cases. On the other hand, higher sales growth is found to be a more conclusive distinguishing characteristic of new exporters.

5000|$|Level 2 is {{a digital}} radio-based system. Movement {{authority}} and other signal aspects {{are displayed in}} the cab for the driver. Apart from a few <b>indicator</b> <b>panels,</b> it is therefore possible to dispense with trackside signalling. However, the train detection and the train integrity supervision still remain {{in place at the}} trackside. Train movements are monitored continually by the radio block centre using this trackside-derived information. The movement authority is transmitted to the vehicle continuously via GSM-R together with speed information and route data. The Eurobalises are used at this level as passive positioning beacons or [...] "electronic milestones". Between two positioning beacons, the train determines its position via sensors (axle transducers, accelerometer and radar). The positioning beacons are used in this case as reference points for correcting distance measurement errors. The on-board computer continuously monitors the transferred data and the maximum permissible speed.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a longitudinal study that measures the public health impact of a multiple intervention rural water and sanitation programme termed the One Million Initiative in Central Mozambique. Data from a 2008 multiple <b>indicator</b> <b>panel</b> survey baseline is compared with results from the 2010 midline using a random selection of 1, 600 households divided over 80 clusters (control and intervention communities). The study reports the impact using two statistical methods: 1) statistical analysis of double differencing; and 2) calculation of DALYs (disability adjusted life years). The results indicate a self-reported reduction from 30 per cent to 14 per cent in cases of waterborne diseases between 2008 and 2010 in the intervention areas. Regression analysis suggests that 3. 1 percentage points of this 16 point decline can be attributed to interventions under the programme.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} learning transfer variables impacting on learning transfer using the Learning Transfer System Inventory (LTSI).

The sample used in this study was a convenience sample of 240 employees working for a Banking group. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and posthoc tests were used to analyse the data. The results show that, while age and gender do not have an impact on the learning transfer factors, level of education, home language and both length of service within the organisation and in the current position do.

40|$|Background. Cardiovascular (CV) {{diseases}} are major causes of morbidity {{and death in}} adults in the world. Major differences {{have been reported in}} the management strategies and the outcome of CV diseases within and between countries. To better understand and address these differences, there is a need for quantitative information on patient management, outcome, and prognosis. Objective. This article describes the development of a set of quality indicators for cardiac care and summarizes work under-taken by the Cardiac Care Panel of the OECD Health Care Quality Indicators Project. Methods. A list of 61 potential indicators was identified through a literature search, review of national measurement systems, and nomination from countries participating in the project. The Cardiac Care Panel then used a modified Delphi process developed originally by RAND to select <b>indicators.</b> <b>Panel</b> members individually rated each indicator on a scale of 1 – 9 for scientific soundness and importance. All indicators receiving scores of 7 or more for both importance and soundness were included in the final set. Results. Seventeen cardiac indicators were selected for the final set of indicators from the following areas: acute coronary syndromes, cardiac interventions, secondary prevention, and congestive heart failure.
