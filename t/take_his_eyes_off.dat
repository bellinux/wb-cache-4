500|$|Another [...] "major {{recurring}} role" [...] debuts in this episode: Eric Bruskotter {{joins the}} cast as Cooter Menkins, [...] "a football recruiter who comes scouting for talent at McKinley, but finds he can’t <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the team’s gruff but big-hearted coach." [...] Other recurring guest stars {{that appear in}} the episode include football coach Shannon Beiste (Jones), the focus of Cooter's eyes, former prom king Dave Karofsky (Adler), exchange student and new glee club member Rory Flanagan (Damian McGinty), and Mike's parents Julia Chang and Mike Chang, Sr. (Tamlyn Tomita and Sim).|$|E
500|$|Sutcliffe {{was fascinated}} by the trio, but {{especially}} Kirchherr, and thought they looked like [...] "real bohemians". Bill Harry later said that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way, and that she always captivated the whole room. Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> her and had tried to talk to Kirchherr during the next break, but she had already left the club. Sutcliffe managed to meet them eventually, and learned that all three had attended the Meisterschule, which was the same type of art college that Lennon and Sutcliffe had attended in Liverpool. (Note: Meisterschule für Mode, Textil, Grafik und Werbung , although it is now called the University of Applied Sciences).|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr, Klaus Voormann, and Jürgen Vollmer were early {{fans of the}} Beatles {{after they}} heard the group play in the Kaiserkeller. Kirchherr, Voormann's girlfriend, was {{initially}} horrified {{at the idea of}} spending any time in such a sordid district, but Voormann, after watching the Beatles several times without her, eventually persuaded her to come too. After having previously only listened to Trad jazz, the Platters, and Nat King Cole, the Rock n' Roll that the Beatles played was totally new to them. The three friends visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr, then 22 years old, later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them." [...] Sutcliffe was fascinated by Kirchherr, and Harry later wrote that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way. Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> her when she had first walked into the club, and tried to talk to her during the next break, but she had already left.|$|E
60|$|The two men shook hands. Kendricks as yet had {{scarcely}} <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> Herr Freudenberg's face.|$|R
60|$|He <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> {{the road}} and glanced down at her curiously. His smile was self-confident, exultant.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{he glanced}} round, and {{perceived}} that the figures he had, as he believed, scarcely <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> were missing.|$|R
500|$|When not {{travelling}} overseas on cricket tours, Harvey {{played baseball}} in the winter for the Fitzroy Baseball Club. He was twice named in the Australian baseball team but the team was named only for the distinction accorded on the players. That is, they never competed. Harvey's fielding abilities were regarded by Wisden as the [...] "finest outfielder in the world" [...] during his career. As a baseball infielder Harvey developed a half round arm throw; its speed and accuracy caused many batsmen to be run out while attempting a run. Ray Robinson said that Harvey's throw was [...] "arrow-like" [...] in accuracy and that [...] "as a versatile fieldsman, this ball-hawk...takes top place". His baseball training also influenced his habit of catching the ball above head height, with which he rarely dropped catches. This {{was based on the}} theory that the fielder need never <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the ball and, if it were to bounce out of his hands, he would have time to attempt to grab the rebound. Harvey also covered ground quickly and possessed and efficient method of picking up and returning the ball. From late 1958 when Norm O'Neill made his Test debut until Harvey's retirement in 1963, the duo formed a formidable pairing in the covers, helping to restrict opposition batsmen from scoring in the region.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, McAleer proved a strong performer. A later {{newspaper}} account {{described him as}} an outstanding outfielder who was [...] "blessed with excellent speed". The article noted that McAleer's skills as a sprinter helped him steal 51 bases in one year and 41 in another. According to some accounts, he was [...] "the first centerfielder to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> a fly ball, run {{to the spot where}} it fell to earth, and catch it". Less proficient as a hitter, McAleer accumulated a lifetime batting average of [...]253. During his career, the league's batting (pitchers removed) average for players with the same home field was [...]284. On April 24, 1894, he assisted in Cleveland's 1–0 victory over Cincinnati with a single in the ninth that drove home Buck Ewing, who had doubled. Along with teammates Cy Young, Jesse Burkett, John Clarkson, and Charles Zimmer, McAleer also participated in the Spiders' victory over the Baltimore Orioles in the 1895 Temple Cup, a post-season series between first and second-place teams of the National League. The Spiders placed second to the Orioles at the close of both the 1895 and 1896 seasons. McAleer's performance came in spite of a serious injury he received during a game held in Philadelphia on August 24, 1895, when he collided with a fence. Furthermore, he balanced his achievements in sports with a foray into politics in his hometown of Youngstown. During the summer of 1895, McAleer was promoted in the local media as a mayoral candidate, first as a Republican, and then as an independent. Further research is required to determine the depth of his involvement in politics.|$|E
60|$|Alec did not <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> George. Walker {{saw what}} was coming {{and looked down at}} the ground.|$|E
6000|$|Pan did {{not answer}} to the suggestion. [...] "Mac, {{what do you say}} to that?" [...] he queried, sharply, but he never <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> Purcell.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{but that}} was neither here nor there. The little green man orated like a--like Cicero. He made us out to be {{magnificent}} fellows. Maximus never <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> our faces.|$|R
60|$|It {{could hardly}} have been as he supposed, for {{although}} he had not <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> companion, and had not seen him move, he sat reclining in his corner as before.|$|R
60|$|Arthur seemed fascinated. He {{could not}} <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the loathsome thing. He watched it slowly heave with even motion.|$|E
60|$|These were Auld Lichts, {{and when}} {{they found that the}} {{minister}} would not <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> them, they obeyed, all save Rob Dow.|$|E
60|$|The warper did not for {{a moment}} <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> a {{contrivance}} with pirns in it that was climbing {{up and down the}} whirring mill.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Miss Harvey," [...] said Mellot, who {{had never}} <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> her face, [...] "I want to turn schoolmaster, and give your {{children}} a drawing lesson. Get your slates, all of you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do now," [...] said Cynthia, {{looking at}} him rather timidly through her lashes. Her face was hot, and she had been, very uncomfortable during Mr. Merrill's remarks. Furthermore, Bob had not <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> me, {{as if he}} had {{suddenly}} seen the meaning behind my words, and was now quite sure of everything he wanted to know. He walked up and down the room, thinking; then he said to me,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] said Mr. Kennedy. Then {{he turned}} to his newspaper, and did not <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> it as long as his wife {{remained}} with him.|$|E
60|$|Breakfast was ordered, {{to which}} the boys did full justice; but Colonel Tempe was still getting on but slowly, for he could not <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> Ralph's face.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless he {{ran back}} to the pile of corn and tried to eat. Somehow he had lost his appetite. He couldn't <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> those two queer things down on the floor.|$|E
60|$|Lingard spun {{round with}} {{aggressive}} mien {{to the light}} touch on his shoulder, {{but as soon as}} he <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> Mr. Travers, <b>his</b> anger fell, seemed to sink without a sound at his feet like a rejected garment.|$|R
60|$|There {{was no need}} to cry out to Syme, who {{had never}} <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> it. He saw the great {{luminous}} globe suddenly stagger in the sky, right itself, and then sink slowly behind the trees like a setting sun.|$|R
50|$|During the off-season, Andolsek {{was working}} in the yard of his Thibodaux home when a {{semi-trailer}} truck ran off the highway {{in front of his house}} and struck and killed him. An investigation found the driver had <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the road.|$|R
60|$|They {{all turned}} up very {{early the next}} arternoon, and Gerty was dressed so nice that George couldn't <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> of her. Besides her there was Mrs. Mitchell and Ted {{and a friend of}} 'is named Charlie Smith.|$|E
60|$|She put {{her hand}} in his. His chest rose. He knew she was seeking to beguile him, {{but he could not}} <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> hers. He was in a worse plight than a woman {{listening}} to the first whisper of love.|$|E
60|$|The tin men {{returned}} this man's stare with interest, {{but they}} did not look away from him because neither of them seemed able to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> this Munchkin, who was remarkable in having one tin arm quite like their own tin arms.|$|E
50|$|Shahryar’s {{interest}} {{and love for}} the arts does not stop with music. His interest in architectural monuments resulted in his degree in architectural design and business from a highly respected university in Miami, Florida.

5000|$|Davy Russell rode 50/1 shot Alfa Beat, {{who fell}} at the Foinavon fence, and said afterward: [...] "I was lucky {{at the first}} because he slithered {{into the back of}} it. At the seventh he just <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> the fence and that was it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Alberto Moravia's 1934, {{the revolutionary}} double-agent, {{faced with the}} girl he is betraying, [...] "was seized by violent desire...he never <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> my bosom...I believe those two dark spots {{at the end of}} my breasts were enough to make him forget tsarism, revolution, {{political}} faith, ideology, and betrayal".|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} that has {{anything}} to do with it." [...] And as he now spoke, John did <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> his book.

60|$|The king, {{on hearing}} this kind invitation, {{instantly}} betook himself to the palace, where he was received in the most hospitable manner. A hundred pages with torches came to meet him, a hundred more waited on him at table, and another hundred waved big fans {{in the air to}} keep the flies from him. Renzolla herself poured out the wine for him, and, so gracefully did she do it, that his Majesty could not <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> her.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked a}} very dainty picture of English rural life, {{and no wonder}} that the {{susceptible}} young Frenchman could scarce <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> her pretty face. The Vicomte de Tournay was scarce nineteen, a beardless boy, on whom terrible tragedies which were being enacted {{in his own country}} had made but little impression. He was elegantly and even foppishly dressed, and once safely landed in England he was evidently ready to forget the horrors of the Revolution in the delights of English life.|$|E
60|$|Philippa {{exchanged}} a general salutation with her guests. She {{was still wearing}} her travelling coat, and her air of fatigue was unmistakable. Griffiths, who had not <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> her since her entrance, wheeled an easy-chair towards the hearth-rug, into which she sank with a murmured word of thanks.|$|R
60|$|He was {{stricken}} speechless with terror, {{but he did}} {{not lose}} the preternatural clearness of his faculties, and he never <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the woman.

60|$|She {{took about}} three-quarters of {{an hour to get}} ready, but when she came down, Ginger felt that it was quite worth it. He couldn't <b>take</b> <b>'is</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> 'er, as the saying goes, and 'e sat by 'er side {{on the top of the}} omnibus like a man in a dream.|$|R
