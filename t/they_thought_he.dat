5|$|Born on July 18, 1913, in Vincennes, Indiana, Richard Skelton was {{the fourth}} and {{youngest}} son of Ida Mae (née Fields) and Joseph Elmer Skelton. Joseph, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; {{he had once been}} a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. During Skelton's lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working at such an early age, Skelton may have claimed he was older than he actually was in order to gain employment. Vincennes neighbors described the Skelton family as being extremely poor; a childhood friend remembered that her parents broke up a youthful romance between her sister and Skelton because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had no future.|$|E
5|$|After the match, an in {{ring segment}} {{took place in}} which The Big Show, entered the ring and asked the crowd whether <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> {{should have been in}} the Championship Scramble for the WWE Championship. SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, who portrays an {{on-screen}} authority figure for the SmackDown brand, then came to the ring and proceeded to insult the Big Show, and demanded that he leave the ring. Druids then came to the ring bringing a casket, and The Undertaker appeared on the TitanTron, telling Guerrero to either get in the casket herself or he would put her in it. Guerrero refused to enter the casket voluntarily, so The Undertaker began to come to ringside. The Big Show held back Guerrero as The Undertaker came to the ring. Once he was in the ring, The Undertaker began to choke Guerrero, but the Big Show turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero. He proceeded to attack The Undertaker, and restrained him to allow Guerrero to slap him and spit in his face.|$|E
5|$|William Rolleston, at {{the time}} Provincial Secretary, {{proposed}} to Mary Brittan in early 1865. He was 34 {{at the time}}, and she was 19. Both Joseph and Sophia Brittan were opposed to this marriage, which is surprising, given that Rolleston was intelligent, well educated, successful, and even of higher social standing. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was too old for their daughter, {{and that she was}} too young to marry. Perhaps Sophia Brittan did not want to lose her daughter, who was in effect running the household and entertaining guests, as she was often too ill to look after these tasks herself. Despite parental objections, an engagement was announced, soon after which Rolleston was offered and accepted the role of Under Secretary for Native Affairs, requiring a move to Wellington. Hence, the wedding went ahead on 24 May 1865 at Avonside Trinity Church, after which the newly-weds moved to the capital.|$|E
60|$|And the courtiers were amazed, {{and some}} of them laughed, for <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> was jesting.|$|R

25|$|For {{eight years}} he {{attended}} Crehana National School, County Waterford {{to which he}} travelled with his older brother, Joe. Fellow pupils recall a boy who retreated into silence because, <b>they</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>he</b> felt intellectually outclassed. His education ended at 13 when he left school to help on the farm after his father went to hospital in Waterford with an ulcer. At 16 he began work as a bricklayer.|$|E
25|$|One {{suggestion}} {{has been}} that Judas expected Jesus to overthrow Roman rule of Judea. In this view, Judas is a disillusioned disciple betraying Jesus {{not so much because}} he loved money, but because he loved his country and thought Jesus had failed it. Another is that Jesus was causing unrest likely to increase tensions with the Roman authorities and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> should be restrained until after the Passover, when everyone had gone back home and the commotion had died down.|$|E

60|$|At first <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> was dead. But the chaplain, Nicholas, {{who was a}} leech, bled him, and he came {{to himself}} again, {{although}} he still wandered in his talk and lay abed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I remember," [...] she said. [...] "It was {{the night}} you left Paris. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> was dead at first, and they {{took him to the}} hospital. I believe that his {{recovery}} was considered almost miraculous." ...|$|R
25|$|Murray The Monster- Murray {{is a human}} {{dressed as}} a monster who once had his own TV show. When Ickis, Oblina and Krumm saw him <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was a real monster betraying them. Tired of making them a {{laughing}} stock, Oblina caused {{him to have a}} nightmare. She, Krumm and Ickis theatened him but he woke up. That's when they scared him for real during a stage show. Murray then retired and started working at a toy store. He also appeared on a talk show in another episode with Simon the monster hunter and two other characters and everyone laughed at him. This character was scrapped after season 1.|$|E
25|$|Terohaute's {{explanation}} was that Hood had been cleaning {{his gun and}} that it had gone off, shooting him through the head. The claim was self-evidently absurd; the rifle was too long for a man to shoot himself with, moreover Hood {{had been shot in the}} back of the head, apparently while reading a book. But with Terohaute stronger than them and armed, there was nothing John Hepburn and Richardson could do for the next three days, as Terohaute refused to let them out of his sight and became more and more aggressive, repeatedly asking to know if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had murdered Hood. Finally, on 23 October, Terohaute left them for a short time to gather lichen. Richardson took the opportunity to load his pistol, and on Terohaute's return, shot him dead.|$|E
25|$|Jiangling was {{initially}} situated on flat lands {{and was a}} very accessible location. However, Lu Kang later ordered Zhang Xian (張咸) to oversee {{the construction of a}} large dyke to block the river flow and direct its waters to flood the flat lands, so as to create a large body of water around the city to serve as a barrier to invaders. When Yang Hu arrived, he planned to make use of this barrier by transporting supplies on boats, but he spread false news that he intended to destroy the dyke to make way for his land army to pass through. When Lu Kang heard that, he saw through Yang Hu's plot and ordered Zhang Xian to destroy the dyke. Lu Kang's officers were shocked and attempted to dissuade him from doing so because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would be doing the enemy a favour, but Lu ignored them. When Yang Hu reached Dangyang (當陽), he was dismayed to hear that the dyke had been destroyed. He {{had no choice but to}} transport his supplies on land, resulting in the wasting of time and effort.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, he {{was badly}} wounded at Talavera, and invalided home. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> {{would not be}} fit for service again, and so {{discharged}} him; and he found his way here, and glad enough I was to have him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Following his {{departure}} from the BBC, Checkland suggested at a Royal Television Society conference that the corporation's governors and the chairman Marmaduke Hussey {{had been out of}} touch: <b>they</b> <b>thought,</b> as <b>he</b> put it, that FM (as in FM radio) [...] "stood for fuzzy monsters!" ...|$|R
60|$|The prince turned home again, {{and told}} the king and the queen what he had met at the cross-roads; but <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> should try again on the {{following}} day, and see whether {{he could not get}} past it, so that he might seek a bride in another kingdom.|$|R
25|$|This {{majority}} {{was furious}} {{with the new}} Governor. Besides despising him for switching parties and supporting the hated abolitionists, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had virtually won {{his office at the}} point of a bayonet. The State House refused to allow Cannon the use of its facilities for his inauguration, and a joint committee of the General Assembly said his inaugural message was not only impertinent, but insolent in the extreme, entirely unbecoming a State Executive, especially one elected by “fraud and violence against the known wish of a majority of the citizens of Delaware.” Then the whole affair was repeated a year later, when federal troops supervised a special election to fill the seat of deceased U.S. Representative William Temple. This time the Democrats boycotted the election, but they were just biding their time. Finally, once again the elections of 1864 were supervised by federal troops, but this time the Democrats voted and swept the election. Without the veto, Cannon was powerless to accomplish anything with the General Assembly. As if to emphasize the point the General Assembly even rejected Cannon’s request to approve the Thirteenth Amendment, prohibiting slavery. This act had been approved by neighboring border state Maryland, but Delaware’s Democrats would refuse to pass this measure for another generation.|$|E

500|$|One of Payton's {{signature}} maneuvers was the [...] "stutter-step", a high-stepping, irregularly paced run. He {{developed this}} {{as a way to}} distract his pursuers during long runs, saying that it startled them into thinking and gave him some advantage over players who were actually faster runners. In his autobiography, he likened the stutter step to a kind of [...] "option play": when he was stutter-stepping, defenders would have to commit to a pursuit angle based upon whether <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would accelerate after the stutter-step, or cut — he would read this angle and do the opposite of what the defender had committed to.|$|E
50|$|He {{died in that}} city. The shahis rulers {{planned to}} murder him after he was deposed because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> could regain the position. His coffin was brought to Bidar. His date of death could not be confirmed. After the death of Kalimullah his son Ilhamullah {{proceeded}} to Mecca and never returned.|$|R
60|$|When {{he arrived}} home {{he found his}} wife and {{daughter}} mourning for him, for <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> had been eaten by lions; but he comforted them, saying that while following a wounded antelope he had missed his way and had wandered {{for a long time before}} he had found the path again.|$|R
60|$|I {{was glad}} to notice that they had {{sufficient}} decency left in them to look very foolish. They explained to him that <b>they</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was some one they knew. They said they hoped he would not deem them capable of so insulting any one except a personal friend of their own.|$|R
500|$|Sutcliffe {{wrote to}} friends {{that he was}} {{infatuated}} with Kirchherr, and asked her friends which colours, films, books and painters she liked, and whom she fancied. Best later commented that {{the beginning of their}} relationship was, [...] "like one of those fairy stories". Kirchherr says that she immediately fell in love with Sutcliffe, and still calls him [...] "the love of my life". Kirchherr and Sutcliffe got engaged in November 1960, and exchanged rings, as is the German custom. Sutcliffe later wrote to his parents that he was engaged to Kirchherr, which they were shocked to learn, as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would give up his career as an artist, although he told Kirchherr {{that he would like to}} be an art teacher in London or Germany in the future. Sutcliffe later borrowed money from Kirchherr for the airfare to fly back to Liverpool in February 1961, returning to Hamburg in March.|$|E

After moving into the Kirchherr family's house, Sutcliffe used to borrow her clothes. He wore her leather pants and jackets, collarless jackets, oversized shirts and long scarves, and also borrowed a corduroy suit with no lapels that he wore on stage, which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him the suit.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "thrash metal" [...] {{was coined}} by Kerrang! {{journalist}} Malcolm Dome {{in reference to}} Anthrax's song [...] "Metal Thrashing Mad" [...] in Kerrang! issue 62, published on February 23, 1984. Prior to this, James Hetfield referred to Metallica's sound as [...] "power metal". In late 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the West Hollywood nightclub Whisky a Go Go, which featured bassist Cliff Burton in a band named Trauma. The two were [...] "blown away" [...] by Burton's use of a wah-wah pedal {{and asked him to}} join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney to leave because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> [...] "didn't contribute anything, he just followed". Although Burton initially declined the offer, {{by the end of the}} year, he had accepted on the condition the band move to El Cerrito in the San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica's first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the Megaforce demo (1983).|$|E
60|$|At first Paul was {{too tired}} to do {{anything}} but sleep, but {{as soon as he was}} rested he started off in search of the three faithless ones, who almost died from fright at the sight of him, for <b>they</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would never come back to reproach them for their wickedness.|$|R
50|$|His {{addiction}} took such {{a physical}} toll {{that in an}} ESPN piece, many of Ungar's friends and fellow competitors said that <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> would not live to see his fortieth birthday.

500|$|In {{his later}} years Henson's lifelong sense of {{loneliness}} was compounded by the growing deafness of his wife, making their conversation difficult. He found some solace in the friendship of her companion, Fearne Booker, who lived with the Hensons for more than thirty years. He occupied a considerable part of his retirement writing a substantial work of autobiography, published in three volumes under the title Retrospect of an Unimportant Life. Both {{at the time and}} subsequently many of his friends and admirers regretted his publishing the work; <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had done his reputation a disservice. Despite what Williams calls the [...] "peculiar interest and vivacity" [...] of the books, his survey of his many campaigns and controversies, seemed to others to be self-justifying and wilfully to deny many changes of stance that he had manifestly made during his career. In Williams's view the posthumous publication of Henson's edited letters were a better legacy: [...] "delightful in both form and content, and, barbed though they often are, they do him fuller justice".|$|E
500|$|But this contradicted O'Neal's {{own account}} of the {{relationship}} in 1995 in Vibe, where she remembered Jackson as [...] "being so shy" [...] and [...] "one of the nicest, most innocent people I've ever met", and, [...] "Once he came into my bedroom, and he wouldn't even sit on my bed." [...] She described the relationship as [...] "a really wonderful friendship" [...] where they would dance and [...] "talk on the phone all the time." [...] She recalled that he found it funny that she could drive at 12 and he couldn't. And that one time they had a [...] "jam session" [...] at her house where he played the drums and her brother played guitar. She said the relationship ended when she was 12, after {{he asked her to}} go to the premiere of The Wiz with him, but her agent disapproved, [...] "maybe because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> wasn't a big enough star yet", and she did what she was told because she was a child. [...] While she claimed they never spoke after that, they were actually shown to be together a number of times after this would have happened.|$|E
500|$|Mike Adams, the {{producer}} of Murder on the Orient Express, was extremely determined to have David Suchet as the voice actor for Poirot, a major character in the game. Nixon thought that Suchet had become so intertwined with the character of Poirot, after his success with the television series Agatha Christie's Poirot, {{that it would be}} hard to imagine someone else doing Poirot's voice without constantly being compared to Suchet. Nixon described the situation as a catch-22, saying that he [...] "worried about someone coming in and doing a Suchet impression instead of a unique rendition of Poirot, yet the more the voice strays from Suchet's version, the more people will wish it was Suchet doing it!" [...] Another reason for the development team's determination to have Suchet aboard was that <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would spur the other voice actors in the game, such as Vanessa Marshall who portrayed Antoinette Marceau, to step up and compete with Suchet's skillful portrayal of Poirot. Fairly late in the game's development, Suchet agreed to do the voice acting. He admitted that one reason for his acceptance of the offer was that he felt possessive of the role of Poirot, considering he had been portraying the character for so long. Adams expressed pride at having succeeded in convincing Suchet to do voice acting for Murder on the Orient Express, and said that his skillful voice acting would bring [...] "tremendous excitement and authenticity" [...] to the game.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the closing}} credits, host Provenza {{would ask the}} child {{audience}} what <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> was unfair. <b>He</b> would ask the audience [...] "Fair or Unfair?", wherein the audience would almost always shout [...] "Unfair!" [...] in unison.|$|R
