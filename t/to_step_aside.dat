5|$|The Flames {{struggled}} {{to begin the}} 2010–11 NHL season, falling to 14th place in the conference at the Christmas break. Consequently, the organization asked Darryl Sutter <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>aside</b> as general manager. The team named assistant Jay Feaster the interim general manager in his place, making it permanent following the season. The team pulled itself back into playoff contention following the change but once again failed {{to qualify for the}} post-season.|$|E
5|$|An all-rounder with a {{moderate}} first class record (averaging 32 with the bat and 40 with the ball), Cowdrey's debut as {{captain in the}} Fourth Test at Headingley was a disaster. He scored 0 and 5 and took no wickets, as England were crushed by 10 wickets, West Indies again winning at a canter. Worse for Cowdrey, he suffered a minor injury in a county match and was persuaded <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>aside</b> for the Fifth Test. He never played for England again.|$|E
5|$|Blaine had {{considered}} {{running for the}} United States House of Representatives from Maine’s 4th district in 1860, but agreed <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>aside</b> when Anson P. Morrill, a former governor, announced {{his interest in the}} seat. Morrill was successful, but after redistricting placed Blaine in the 3rd district for the 1862 elections, he allowed his name to be put forward. Running on a campaign of staunch support for the war effort, Blaine was elected with an ample majority despite Republican losses across the rest of the country.|$|E

These included the Europe Minister Caroline Flint, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, the Minister for Children Beverley Hughes, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Hazel Blears, and Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell, who resigned minutes after the polls for the local and European elections had closed and sent a letter to the Prime Minister calling on him <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>aside.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a victory}} over the Buffalo Sabres after Christmas, and with the team still mired in 14th place in the Western Conference, General Manager and Executive Vice President Darryl Sutter {{announced}} his resignation from both positions on December 28, exactly eight years after {{he was hired by}} the team to become its coach in 2002. The move was not entirely Sutter's decision, as he was asked by the organization <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>aside.</b> The decision came as a shock to many fans, even as it was believed to be inevitable following the team's decline in recent seasons. Jay Feaster assumed control of the team, serving as acting general manager.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{spoke in}} front of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the first sitting U.S. {{president}} to do so. He gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progresses made in education, infrastructure, and economy. He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>aside,</b> discrimination against minorities (LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified democratization and free trade, to significantly {{improve the quality of life}} for Africans. During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to visit Kenya, which is the homeland of his father.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, a clear {{majority of}} the House of Representatives were pledged to Crittenden for the open Senate seat. However, Clay allies pressured Crittenden <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>aside</b> and allow Clay to be the Whig nominee.

Crittenden went on to manage both the unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign of Richard Aylett Buckner and the campaign to help Clay win Kentucky in the 1832 presidential election. After Clay's defeat in 1832, he offered to resign his Senate seat and allow Crittenden to succeed him, but Crittenden refused the offer. Later that year, Crittenden retired from the General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|On November 2, at {{a secret}} conference in Erkwit, Sudan, the royalists and {{republicans}} declared a ceasefire effective at 1:00 PM on Monday, November 8. Tribesmen {{of both sides}} celebrated the decision until that day, and for two days after it went into effect, they fraternized at several places. On November 2 and 3, nine royalists and nine republicans, with a Saudi and an Egyptian observer, worked out the terms. A conference of 168 tribal leaders was planned for November 23. For the royalists, the conference was to become an embryo national assembly that would name a provisional national executive of two royalists, two republicans and one neutral, to administer the country provisionally and to plan a plebiscite. Until that plebiscite, which would decide whether Yemen would be a monarchy or a republic, both Sallal and al-Badr were <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>aside.</b> At {{the end of the}} two days the Egyptians resumed their bombing of royalist positions. The conference planned for November 23 was postponed to the 30th, then indefinitely. The republicans blamed the royalists for not arriving, while the royalists blamed the Egyptian bombings.|$|E

50|$|Muhammad bin Abdulaziz was Crown Prince {{during the}} first few months (November 1964 - March 1965) of the reign of his elder {{half-brother}} King Faisal. He then voluntarily <b>stepped</b> <b>aside</b> from the succession to allow his younger and only full brother, Prince Khalid, to become heir apparent to the Saudi throne. Due to this event, he was called king maker. He is said <b>to</b> have <b>stepped</b> <b>aside</b> in order <b>to</b> comply with a general family agreement. That agreement had been negotiated during the period of internal crisis which saw the abdication, in late 1964, of the profligate King Saud, in favour of another half-brother, King Faisal. Prince Muhammad's renunciation, therefore, helped to defuse that crisis and facilitated the takeover of power by King Faisal.|$|R
5000|$|On January 11, 2007, after {{a two-day}} court hearing, Judge Denis Power of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice issued a {{decision}} confirming that the Party's agreement with Riddell was legally binding, and ordering it to immediately pay Riddell. The Judge ruled that when Riddell had <b>stepped</b> <b>aside</b> for Cutler, {{he had been}} [...] "the preferred choice of the clear majority" [...] and that [...] "the evidence, taken as whole, clearly establishes that an agreement was reached". He concluded that [...] "the crux of the agreement was that Mr. Riddell, the leading contender for the nomination, agreed <b>to</b> voluntarily <b>step</b> <b>aside</b> in favour of Allan Cutler in exchange {{for which he was}} to receive some financial compensation for expenses incurred by him in seeking the nomination".|$|R

50|$|Born in Wisconsin in 1878, Joseph Meyer {{acquired}} a curiosity about plants and nature {{at a young}} age. His father, who was a photographer, often took Meyer out on assignments into forests and fields. From here, he {{learned a great deal}} about various aspects of nature. Complications in Meyer's family and financial life caused him <b>to</b> temporarily <b>step</b> <b>aside</b> from nature and take up a more practical career in printing. Meyer soon found himself in Chicago working for a large printer. Not long after, a strike shut down the printer and Meyer found himself at The Hammond Times.|$|R
60|$|He {{was white}} to the lips. As much by her vehement pretence of sincerity {{as by the}} {{apparently}} irrefragable logic of her arguments, she forced conviction upon him. This brought a loathly fear in its train, and the gates of his heart stood ever wide <b>to</b> fear. He <b>stepped</b> <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> a chair, and sank into it, looking at her with dilating eyes--a fool confronted with the likely fruits of his folly.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{there was a}} growing split in the North Carolina Republican Party between {{supporters}} of James Holshouser and James Gardner for governor in 1972. Rohrer, a Holshouser supporter, was beat out for {{the chairmanship of the}} party by Gardner supporter Frank Rouse. Rohrer then became vice chairman of the party and during 1972 was interim chair when Rouse decided <b>to</b> temporarily <b>step</b> <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> campaign for Gardner. She was instrumental in helping resolve the rift between the two party factions. Her first try for statewide office also came in 1972. That year, Rohrer ran for North Carolina Secretary of State. She would wind up losing to long-time Democratic incumbent Thad A. Eure in the general election, 55.92%-44.08%.|$|R

Quisling, as minister president, later formed a collaborationist government under German control. Up to 15,000 Norwegians volunteered to fight in German units, including the Waffen-SS.|$|E
25|$|In mid-September 1994, with U.S. troops {{prepared}} to enter Haiti by force for Operation Uphold Democracy, President Bill Clinton dispatched a negotiating {{team led by}} former President Jimmy Carter to persuade the authorities <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>aside</b> and allow {{for the return of}} constitutional rule. With intervening troops already airborne, Cédras and other top leaders agreed to step down. In October, Aristide was able to return. The Haitian general election, 1995 in June 1995 saw Aristide's coalition, the Lavalas (Waterfall) Political Organization, gain a sweeping victory, and René Préval, a prominent Aristide political ally, elected President with 88% of the vote. When Aristide's term ended in February 1996, this was Haiti's first ever transition between two democratically elected presidents.|$|E
25|$|In November 1913 the Albanian pro-Ottoman {{forces had}} offered {{the throne of}} Albania to the Ottoman war {{minister}} of Albanian origin, Izzet Pasha. The Ottoman Empire sent agents to encourage a revolt, hoping to restore Ottoman suzerainty over Albania. Izzet Pasha sent major Beqir Grebenali, another ethnic Albanian, {{to be one of}} his chief representatives in Albania. The Provisional Government of Albania under control of Ismail Qemali captured and executed major Beqir Grebenali. Such provocative and damaging display of independence of Qemali's government angered Great Powers and International Commission of Control forced Qemali <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>aside</b> and leave Albania. At that time the Commission was not able to force Essad Pasha to leave Albania, because it did not have enough authority.|$|E

5000|$|Gratidianus had {{an unusual}} second praetorship, {{possibly}} as a [...] "consolation prize" [...] granted him when his faction decided {{to back the}} younger Marius and Gnaeus Papirius Carbo for the consulship of 82. Although his ambitions were known and his qualifications far exceeded those of his cousin, Gratidianus probably never made a formal announcement of his candidacy for the consulship, and is assumed <b>to</b> have <b>stepped</b> <b>aside</b> {{for the sake of}} the unity of the populares. The more likely candidtes from their party would have been Gratidianus and Quintus Sertorius; the political snub evidently contributed to the latter's secession in Spain. The dates for Gratidianus' praetorships are arguable; T.R.S. Broughton gives 86 and 84, but the timing of the currency reform makes 85 a more secure date, with the second term in 84, 83, or 82.|$|R
