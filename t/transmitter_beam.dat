40|$|Abstract—To {{establish}} {{optical communication}} between any two satellites, the transmitter satellite must track the beacon of the receiver satellite and point the information optical beam in its direction. Optical tracking and pointing systems for free space suffer during tracking from high-amplitude vibration because of background radiation from interstellar {{objects such as}} the Sun, Moon, Earth, and stars in the tracking field of view or the mechanical impact from satellite internal and external sources. The vibrations of beam pointing increase the bit error rate and jam communication between the two satellites. One way to overcome this problem {{is the use of}} very small <b>transmitter</b> <b>beam</b> divergence angles of too narrow divergence angle is that the <b>transmitter</b> <b>beam</b> may sometimes miss the receiver satellite, due to pointing vibrations. In this paper we propose the use of genetic algorithm to optimize the BER as function of transmitter optics aperture...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} the outage probability {{and the average}} bit error rate (BER) performance of a dual-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying system, composed of a mixed radio fre-quency (RF) /free-space optical (FSO) link, when simultaneously outdated channel state information (CSI) is assumed at the relay {{and there is a}} misalignment between transmitter and receiver apertures in FSO link. In contrast to the majority of works on CSI-assisted AF relays, in this paper, we assume that the estimated CSI is outdated, when the relay amplifies the transmitted signal. The RF link experiences Rayleigh fading, while the FSO link is under the influence of atmospheric turbulence, modeled by the Gamma-Gamma distribution. Novel analytical expressions for the outage probability and the average BER are derived in a power series form, which in some special cases are simplified to offer engineering insight into the effects of important transceiver and channel parameters on the system performance. Numerical and simulation results show that there is an optimal value of the <b>transmitter</b> <b>beam</b> waist, which minimizes the overall outage prob-ability. This optimal value strongly depends on the pointing errors standard deviation. Furthermore, the outage probability varies for several orders of magnitude depending on the <b>transmitter</b> <b>beam</b> waist.

40|$|Copyright © 2008 IEEEA {{demonstration}} of multiple-input multiple-output over-the-horizon radar is presented. Transmitter signal beam- forming on a multi-element array has been created, not conventionally before transmission at the transmitter facility, but, after radar signal transmission, skywave propagation, target scattering, return signal propagation, and reception using an over-the-horizon radar receiver. Transmitter beam-patterns {{have been created}} simultaneously from the signal received at two widely separated locations. The first is within line-of-sight propagation of the end-point of the one-hop ionospheric transmitter to target path, and the second from the signal received at the end-point of the two-hop ionospheric transmitter to target to receiver propagation path. These beampatterns are shown to be practically identical. They reveal the target radar return signal direction-of-departure at the transmitter.
