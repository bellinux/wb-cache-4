5|$|As {{a result}} of the gift of $1 million, total {{endowment}} credited during <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> was $5.2 million.

5|$|As before, the MPGA {{supported}} and assisted the new fundraising campaign. However, although <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> was initially boosted by a £1,000 donation from Octavia Hill, fundraising was slow, and by October 1898 only £2,000 had been raised.

5|$|The JNA's {{offensive}} operations, directly {{associated with}} <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> {{in the east}} Croatian region of Slavonia, were launched on 20 September. The assault on Croatian positions in Vukovar gradually became the main effort of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> as the JNA was repeatedly unable to capture the city. The fighting in and around Vukovar lasted months and eventually drew in the JNA's main armoured force, which had previously been slated to advance west towards Serb-held areas in western Slavonia. In addition to relieving its Vukovar garrison, the JNA wished to dissipate the Croatian forces in the city {{so that they would}} not pose any threat to its rear in the event that <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> progressed west of Vinkovci.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> {{effectively}} {{started on}} 20 September 1991, even though relatively minor offensive actions {{had already been}} undertaken.

In early October, the original campaign objectives were reduced as Serbian president Slobodan Milošević and his allies gained greater control of the JNA. Subsequently, <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> objectives were redefined to deny the Croatian Government access to parts of Croatia that contained substantial Serb populations and to protect Croatian Serbs. <b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> culminated in late November and early December with the Battle of Vukovar and the Siege of Dubrovnik. A limited Croatian counterattack and the development of the HV led to a stalemate on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> in the Adriatic {{has been}} {{credited}} with having {{a significant effect on}} the wider war through the disruption of French forces in the Balkans. It has been suggested that Napoleon intended to invade the Ottoman Empire following the War of the Fifth Coalition, but was dissuaded in part due to the difficulty of supplying a force in the region without control of the Adriatic, his attention eventually turning to Russia. <b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> also had effects on the morale and effectiveness of the French fleet, which lost some of its best commanders and frigates in <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> and on the Austrian advance on Italy in 1813, when French defence lines were repeatedly out-flanked by British attacks from the sea.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{campaign}} received mixed impressions from reviewers.

Brown stated that while <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> was brief, he felt it had good pacing and there was a decent variety of objectives and scenarios. Stapleton agreed that <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> missions offered enough variety to prevent them from becoming repetitive. However, overall he was unimpressed by <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> missions, which he perceived as unambitious in their design.
