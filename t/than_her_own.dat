5|$|In {{the years}} to follow, public revelations {{on the state of}} Charles and Diana's {{marriage}} continued. Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher {{than at any time in}} living memory, republicanism was still a minority viewpoint, and the Queen herself had high approval ratings. Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the Queen's wider family rather <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> behaviour and actions. In consultation with her husband and the Prime Minister, John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and her private secretary, Robert Fellowes, she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, saying that a divorce was desirable.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} Rahul Khanna (Shah Rukh Khan) {{standing}} in front of the funeral pyre of his wife Tina (Rani Mukerji). Through a series of flashbacks we are shown Rahul and Tina's marriage, their honeymoon, Tina's pregnancy with their daughter and the child's eventual birth. It is revealed that Tina was aware of complications in her pregnancy, during which only mother or child could be saved, but decided not to tell Rahul as she knew how much he wanted a child. During her pregnancy, Tina, who also loved the baby more <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> life, writes eight letters to her daughter (one for each of her first eight birthdays) and gives them to Rahul's mother (Farida Jalal). Before dying, Tina asks Rahul to promise her to name their daughter Anjali.|$|E
25|$|Antonietta Di Martino (born 1 June 1978 in Cava de' Tirreni) is {{a retired}} Italian high jumper. She {{currently}} holds the Italian national women's high jump record at 2.03 metres for outdoor events and 2.04 metres for indoor events. She also currently holds the women's all-time highest jump-differential, meaning she has jumped the highest (0.35 metres) more <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> height.|$|E

25|$|Merkel {{supported}} a substantial reform agenda for Germany's {{economic and social}} system, and was considered more pro-market <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> party (the CDU). She advocated German labour law changes, specifically removing barriers to laying off employees and increasing the allowed number of work hours in a week. She argued that existing laws made the country less competitive, because companies could not easily control labour costs when business is slow.|$|E
25|$|Although her rank {{was more}} a {{reflection}} of Sutherland's status rather <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own,</b> Clark became an assistant to the headquarters commandant, with duties commensurate with her rank, and moved with Advance GHQ to Hollandia. However, her presence there in contravention of MacArthur's agreement with Curtin, and brought down the displeasure of MacArthur, who ordered her {{to be returned to}} Australia, first from Hollandia, and later from the Philippines. That Sutherland defied MacArthur on this matter caused a rift between the two.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the name}} might imply it, a queen bee does not {{directly}} control the hive. Her sole function is {{to serve as the}} reproducer. A well-mated and well-fed queen of quality stock can lay about 1,500 eggs per day during the spring build-up—more <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> body weight in eggs every day. She is continuously surrounded by worker bees who meet her every need, giving her food and disposing of her waste. The attendant workers also collect and then distribute queen mandibular pheromone, a pheromone that inhibits the workers from starting queen cells.|$|E

25|$|Soon after MGR's death, AIADMK {{was split}} between his widow Janaki Ramachandran and Jayalalitha. Although both factions {{had lost the}} elections, Jayalalitha's AIADMK won 27 seats when {{compared}} to just one won by Janaki's party. Following the election defeat, Janaki retired from active politics and the two party factions rejoined. Although a successful film star of yesteryear, according to Professor Sara Dickey, Jayalalitha's popularity in politics comes from MGR rather <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> success on screen. She served three terms as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, including the present term, as of 2011.|$|E
25|$|Family, or lack thereof, remains {{important}} throughout both Hilde's {{childhood and}} adulthood. Hilde's childhood is laden with abuse and patriarchal superiority. This {{is represented by}} her father's harmful actions and her mother's unwillingness to ask her brothers to do housework. In the ideal fascist society the family unit mimicked the hierarchical structure of the state. In Hilde's case, the state was stronger and more stable <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> family unit. This is evident at {{the climax of the}} novel, when she is having an inner struggle about choosing to do what was right by Germany's standards or by Hannes' standards. In the end she chose Germany's — her family life was too weak and dysfunctional {{to stand up to the}} beliefs instilled by the state and the only morals she was aware of were state-taught.|$|E
25|$|The second series, Ben Harper, {{husband and}} father to three {{different}} and often difficult children, has spent his working life as a dentist. Just {{as well as most}} of his life seems rather like pulling teeth. His wife Susan is usually busy showing foreign tourists around London, a place she knows much better <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> kitchen. Ben and Susan have been married happily enough to have three children. However, Ben has the feeling that most of the time his children seem to speak a different language. Nick (20) has persuaded his parents he would benefit from a gap year to see something of the world, but he has hardly seen anything beyond the confines of the sofa. Janey (17) is into boys, fashion labels (expensive ones), and getting her own way. Michael (14) is the brightest of the trio. He is seriously into computers and not so seriously (yet) into girls.|$|E

25|$|A pure SR {{analysis}} {{would be}} as follows: Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip. When she fires her rockets for the turnaround, she experiences a pseudo force which resembles a gravitational force. Figs.2‑6 and 2‑11 illustrate the concept of lines (planes) of simultaneity: Lines parallel to the observer's x-axis (xy-plane) represent sets of events that are simultaneous in the observer frame. In Fig.2‑11, the blue lines connect events on Terence's world line which, from Stella's point of view, are simultaneous with events on her world line. (Terence, in turn, would observe a set of horizontal lines of simultaneity.) Throughout both the outbound and the inbound legs of Stella's journey, she measures Terence's clocks as running slower <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own.</b> But during the turnaround (i.e. between the bold blue lines in the figure), a shift {{takes place in the}} angle of her lines of simultaneity, corresponding to a rapid skip-over of the events in Terence's world line that Stella considers to be simultaneous with her own. Therefore, {{at the end of her}} trip, Stella finds that Terence has aged more than she has.|$|E
500|$|In about 1821, Seacole visited London, {{staying for}} a year, and visited her {{relatives}} in the merchant Henriques family. Although London {{had a number of}} black people, she records that a companion, a West Indian with skin darker <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> [...] "dusky" [...] shades, was taunted by children. Seacole herself was [...] "only a little brown"; she was nearly white according to Ramdin. She returned to London approximately a year later, bringing a [...] "large stock of West Indian pickles and preserves for sale". Her later travels would be as an [...] "unprotected" [...] woman, without a chaperone or sponsor—an unusual practice. Seacole returned to Jamaica in 1825.|$|E
500|$|In January 1798 Godwin {{published}} his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Although Godwin {{felt that he}} was portraying his wife with love, compassion, and sincerity, many readers were shocked that he would reveal Wollstonecraft's illegitimate children, love affairs, and suicide attempts. The Romantic poet Robert Southey accused him of [...] "the want of all feeling in stripping his dead wife naked" [...] and vicious satires such as The Unsex'd Females were published. Godwin's Memoirs portrays Wollstonecraft as a woman deeply invested in feeling who was balanced by his reason and as more of a religious sceptic <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> writings suggest. Godwin's views of Wollstonecraft were perpetuated throughout the nineteenth century and resulted in poems such as [...] "Wollstonecraft and Fuseli" [...] by British poet Robert Browning and that by William Roscoe which includes the lines: ...|$|E

500|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} uses {{cooperative}} breeding {{as a form}} of family insurance. The female regularly transfers her offspring to other females' nests—and likewise grooms and cares for offspring other <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own.</b> While this can have a high physiological cost on a lactating female that is already expending a lot of energy, it can be beneficial overall to insuring survival among closely related groups with high mortality risk. [...] A study that took place over three breeding seasons showed that closely related females form breeding groups mainly when {{there is a shortage of}} suitable roosts; [...] when there is an advantage of a communal nest for defense, or when there are thermoregulatory benefits. In the event of offspring adoption, when a parent dies and a closely related female takes over care, it is believed that this is beneficial to groups with high mortality risk.|$|E
500|$|Even as she {{continued}} to win against fellow Americans in 1982 and 1983, however, she was slumping and falling behind her international competition. [...] She set no new international records, and was increasingly frustrated with her own performances. [...] At the 1982 World Championships in Guayaquil, Ecuador, she finished a distant third in both the 200-meter and 400-meter individual medley events against her East German competition, and failed to place in the third event {{in which she was}} entered. [...] At the 1983 U.S. Long-Course Championships in Fresno, California, she finished five seconds slower <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> American record in the 400-meter individual medley and finished second behind Mary T. Meagher in the 200-meter butterfly. [...] At the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela, held later the same month, she likewise won her two signature events in the 200-meter and 400-meter individual medley, but did not approach her own personal bests.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{commercial}} success of PCD (2005), {{and over the}} course of two years (2005–07), Scherzinger recorded 75-100 songs for Her Name Is Nicole, her planned solo debut album. [...] Her work as lead singer furthered Scherzinger's popularity as she began work on her own music. She stated that she enjoyed collaborating with many different artists, and that although she had been writing songs for over ten years, {{she felt as if she}} was at a different level while working with such A-list writers and producers. Following the moderate success of [...] "Baby Love", the complete lack of success of the singles such as [...] "Whatever U Like" [...] and numerous push backs, Scherzinger decided to put the release of the on hold. She then returned her focus back on the Pussycat Dolls, and recording commenced for their second studio album. Scherzinger cited that she felt as if the songs were more suited as a Pussycat Dolls song <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own.</b>|$|E

500|$|On 5 March 1495, Lisa married Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo, a {{modestly}} successful {{cloth and}} silk merchant, becoming {{his third wife}} at age15. Lisa's dowry was 170florins and the San Silvestro farm near her family's country home, {{a sign that the}} Gherardini family was not wealthy at the time and reason to think she and her husband loved each other. The property lies between Castellina and San Donato in Poggio, near two farms later owned by Michelangelo. Neither poor nor among the most well-to-do in Florence, the couple lived a middle-class life. Lisa's marriage may have increased her social status because her husband's family may have been richer <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own.</b> Francesco is thought to have benefited because Gherardini is an [...] "old name". They lived in shared accommodation until 5March 1503, when Francesco was able to buy a house next door to his family's old home in the Via della Stufa. Leonardo is thought to have begun painting Lisa's portrait the same year.|$|E
500|$|A Herald Sun reviewer, however, {{thought she}} gave the final season of Will & Grace the [...] "send-off it deserved."

[...] Browne, however, thought her appearance was [...] "fun to watch". The Sunday Mail was also positive about Spears' performance, commenting that she [...] "does well, especially when you remember the dismal Crossroads." [...] Trent Vanegas of Pink is the New Blog said that doing the show was a [...] "great move" [...] for Spears. Television researcher Tim Brooks, the co-author of the 1979 book The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, commented that Spears' role was a [...] "very {{good way to get}} her chops into comedy", in part because it is [...] "very out of type. She's not just playing herself as a celebrity." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{completion}} of composing [...] "Fifteen", Swift became very nervous to show Anderson the song, for {{she did not know}} how her friend would respond. [...] "It was a really personal song, especially from her angle of it." [...] However, when Swift performed the song for Anderson and asked whether she was comfortable with the song, Anderson confirmed: [...] "She said, 'Does it bother you that your name is in a song that's so personal?' And it really doesn't just because of the way Taylor and I feel about it. If one girl can kind of learn from it or connect to a song like that, it's totally worth it." [...] With Anderson's consent, Swift recorded [...] "Fifteen" [...] with producer Nathan Chapman, who produced all but one track on Swift's 2006 eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift. Recording the highly personal track caused Swift to cry. Swift attributed the event to {{the fact that she is}} most likely to cry over when her loved ones undergo pain, as she witnesses it, rather <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> experiences. She went to say [...] "Fifteen" [...] usually gets her every time.|$|E
