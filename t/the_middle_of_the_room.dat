5|$|Food Circus: The Food Circus was a {{food court}} in the former armory, later named the Center House, and {{recently}} renamed The Armory (2012) as a remodel of the building continues. Unlike the current arrangement with a stage and a large open space for dancing, events, and temporary booths, many food booths were in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{as well as at}} the edges. There were 52concessionaires in all, nine of them with exhibits in addition to their food for sale. Beginning in 1963, the Food Circus also housed a variety of museums, including Jones' Fantastic Show, the Jules Charbneau World of Miniatures, and the Pullen Klondike Museum.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage {{to look at all}} the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, a monkey, a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts it on her shoulders. During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, she closes her eyes again and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E

25|$|Examples of {{children}} raised under the Kibbutz system of equality are given by Yosef Criden. When an aunt {{from a nearby}} city comes to visit her niece or nephew and brings a box of chocolate as a present for them, the child will excitedly open it up and eat {{a few of the}} chocolates. Then the child will go over {{to the rest of the}} group and give the rest of the chocolates to their peers. This is the ideology instilled in the children, to value the self but also to always think about others. Another example Yosef gives is that when his son, who was born and raised on a kibbutz, went into the army, he and his fellow bunk mates asked their supervising officer for a box. They wanted to keep the box in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and whenever they would get care packages, they would put the items into the box and share them communally. They did not want to be like most of the units of officers from towns and cities, where each officer would hide their packages under their beds.|$|E

500|$|In June 1972, {{the band}} reconvened in Los Angeles {{to begin work}} on their next album at the Record Plant.

The album was originally titled Snowblind after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse.

The album acts as Jackson's response to the media and the public. In 1993, Evan Chandler and his son Jordan Chandler accused Jackson of child sexual abuse. Jackson agreed to a strip search of his body at Neverland Ranch; the strip search was ordered by Thomas W. Sneddon Jr., the district attorney of Santa Barbara County, California. Sneddon {{was in charge of the}} investigation as a whole. The accuser gave a detailed description of what he alleges were Jackson's genitals, also giving details on patches of vitiligo on the singer's body, but eventually the description was proved wrong.

500|$|The video {{takes place}} in a large cathedral-like room, with large winding {{staircases}} on each side. Throughout the video, the scenery changes several times from a cloudy and sunny day, to a glowing sunset. These time shifts are seen through a large carved window in the cathedral. The video begins with Carey's hair in long golden curls, and her wearing a skin-tight black jumper. She sits on the large ledge by the window, staring into the different colors in the sky. As the video progresses, Carey is joined by a small black cat, which accompanies her as she meditates on the large stairwell. After the song's second verse, a large microphone is seen in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> where scenes of Carey singing and standing on the window's ledge interchange.

500|$|In March 1798, Kościuszko {{received}} {{a bundle of}} letters from Europe.

[...] The letter in question contained news that Polish General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski and Polish soldiers were fighting in France under Napoleon and that Kościuszko's sister had sent his two nephews in Kościuszko's name to serve in Napoleon's ranks. Around that time Kościuszko also received news that Talleyrand was seeking Kościuszko's moral and public endorsement for the French fight against one of Poland's partitioners, Prussia. The call of family and country drew Kościuszko back to Europe. He immediately consulted Thomas Jefferson, who procured him a passport under a false name and arranged for his secret departure for France. Kościuszko left no word for either his former comrade-in-arms and fellow St. Petersburg prisoner Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz or for his own servant, only leaving some money for them.|$|E

By the late 19th century the house had been greatly altered, but the original structure was restored by Robert Isham. Isham found and restored the house, which still featured the original posts and beams. The large fireplace remained intact, but was concealed behind a fireboard and closet, that was itself behind a stove. The result was that stone fireplace was completely concealed prior to restoration. Less than a decade later after Isham restored the original part of the house, the whole structure was demolished.|$|E
