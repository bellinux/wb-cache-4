The shortest path in this research means the fastest path between the source and destination. In Recent, dynamic routingalgorithms are currently used and developed by researchers. This research algorithm suggests that the fastest paths between the source and the destination which is based on using the record of the network traffic history. Main subjecton networking is a user, and the pattern of network usage is always corresponding to network history. Users are using the networking and the network traffic is always corresponding to how many users use the networking in specific time. Therefore, network traffic information can be predicted by the network condition which is referring to the history of network <b>traffic</b> <b>record,</b> and then the shortest path can be produced without using RIP too much.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the rapid {{development}} and wide application of information technology and Internet, our society has come into the information explosion era. Meanwhile, it brings in new and severe challenges to the field of network attack behavior detection due to the explosive growth and high complexity of network traffic. Therefore, an effective and efficient detection mechanism that can detect attack behavior from large scale of network traffic plays an important role. In this paper, we focus on how to distinguish the attack traffic from normal data flows in Big Data and propose a novel real-time DDoS attack detection mechanism based on Multivariate Dimensionality Reduction Analysis (MDRA). In this mechanism, we first reduce the dimensionality of multiple characteristic variables in a network <b>traffic</b> <b>record</b> by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Then, we analyze the correlation of the lower dimensional variables. Finally, the attack traffic can be differentiated from the normal traffic by MDRA and Mahalanobis distance (MD). Compared with previous research methods, our experimental results show that higher precision rate is achieved and it approximates to 100 % in True Negative Rate (TNR) for detection; CPU computing time is one-eightieth and memory resource consumption is one-third of the previous detection method based on Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA); computing complexity is constant...|$|E
40|$|There is a disproportional risk {{of motor}} vehicle death and injury among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) {{population}}s in the United States. As home to the nation’s largest population of AI individuals, {{it is vital that}} California develop {{a better understanding of the}} factors contributing to this risk to guide the development and implementation of interventions to improve traffic safety for this population on the nearly 100 Rancherias and reservations in the state. However, there is very little data about the numbers and types of collisions, and driver and environmental factors contributing to the collisions that occur on tribal lands. As a first step toward better understanding the scope of the risk disparity, and the shortcomings in data collection, SafeTREC conducted a literature review and crash analysis using data from the Statewide Integrated <b>Traffic</b> <b>Record</b> System (SWITRS) and tribal area base maps targeting these communities. As a result of presentations and discussions at a California Tribal Safety conference where these analyses were presented, a number of procedural and institutional challenges were identified. Addressing these issues will not only help policymakers identify interventions to improve traffic safety on tribal lands, but it will give tribal jurisdictions tools to compete for scarce safety funding through the use of data documenting the need for safety improvements. Future research efforts should be aimed at refining these and other initiatives to address both the dire conditions of traffic safety on California’s tribal lands, and the limitations of the data...|$|E

A 26 -year-old city man was seriously hurt Saturday when his motorcycle crashed into the rear of a car and exploding gasoline tanks set fire to three automobiles.

40|$|Detection of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks has {{attracted}} researchers since 1990 s. A variety of detection systems {{has been proposed}} to achieve this task. Unlike the existing approaches based on machine learning and statistical analysis, the proposed system treats <b>traffic</b> <b>records</b> as images and detection of DoS attacks as a computer vision problem. A multivariate correlation analysis approach is introduced to accurately depict network <b>traffic</b> <b>records</b> and to convert the records into the respective images. The images of network <b>traffic</b> <b>records</b> are used as the observed objects of our proposed DoS attack detection system, which is developed based on a widely used dissimilarity measure, namely Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD). EMD takes cross-bin matching into account and provides a more accurate evaluation on the dissimilarity between distributions than some other well-known dissimilarity measures, such as Minkowskiform distance Lp and X 2 statistics. These unique merits facilitate our proposed system with effective detection capabilities. To evaluate the proposed EMD-based detection system, ten-fold cross-validations are conducted using KDD Cup 99 data set and ISCX 2012 IDS Evaluation data set. The results presented in the system evaluation section illustrate that our detection system can detect unknown DoS attacks and achieves 99. 95 % detection accuracy on KDD Cup 99 data set and 90. 12 % detection accuracy on ISCX 2012 IDS evaluation data set with processing capability of approximately 59, 000 <b>traffic</b> <b>records</b> per second...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Injuries and {{fatalities}} {{in adult}} drivers 18 – 65 {{years of age}} have decreased in recent years due to safer vehicles, enhanced medical policies, and implementation of injury prevention policies. However, adult drivers over 65 years of age are continuing to suffer from motor vehicle collision-related injuries and fatalities at a more constant rate. A number of physiological factors contribute to the deterioration in visual acuity, slower reaction speeds, and decreased awareness in older drivers. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine injury severity and fatality rates in older drivers compared to their younger counterparts in Orange County, California. Methods: This study used the Statewide Integrated <b>Traffic</b> <b>Record</b> System data for Orange County for the years 1998 – 2007. Drivers were categorized into 4 age groups: 25 – 64, 65 – 74, 75 – 84, and older than 85 years of age. Injury severity was assessed by the investigating officer. Results: Of the 197, 814 drivers involved in motor vehicle collisions, 178, 481 (90. 2 %) were in the 25 – 64 age group; 11, 397 (5. 8 %) were 65 – 74; 6, 592 (3. 3 %) were 75 – 84; and 1, 344 drivers (0. 7 %) were over 85. Those aged 25 – 64 had the lowest fatality rate per 100, 000 people, 2. 5, whereas those 75 – 84 had the highest fatality rate, 4. 9. The percent of crashes involving a left turn increased with age, and the percent that were stopped in the road decreases with age. Change in injury collision involvement ratio in the 3 younger age groups decreased by 26 % to 32 %, but decreased by 18 % among drivers aged 85 years and older. Conclusion: The decrease in collision fatalities was greater in the 25 – 64 -year-old group compared to the older adult population. This disparity highlights the need for further injury prevention efforts for older drivers...|$|E
40|$|Most {{companies}} {{relying on}} an Information Technology (IT) system for their daily operations heavily invest in its maintenance. Tools that monitor network <b>traffic,</b> <b>record</b> anomalies and {{keep track of}} the changes that occur in the system are usually used. Root cause analysis and change impact analysis are two main activities involved in the management of IT systems. Currently, there exists no universal model to guide analysts while performing these activities. Although the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) provides a guide to the or- ganization and structure of the tools and processes used to manage IT systems, it does not provide any models {{that can be used to}} implement the required features. This thesis focuses on providing simple and effective models and processes for root cause analysis and change impact analysis through mining useful artifacts stored in a Confguration Management Database (CMDB). The CMDB contains information about the different components in a system, called Confguration Items (CIs), as well as the relationships between them. Change reports and incident reports are also stored in a CMDB. The result of our work is the Decision support for Root cause Analysis and Change impact Analysis (DRACA) framework which suggests possible root cause(s) of a problem, as well as possible CIs involved in a change set based on di erent proposed models. The contributions of this thesis are as follows: - An exploration of data repositories (CMDBs) that have not been previously attempted in the mining software repositories research community. - A causality model providing decision support for root cause analysis based on this mined data. - A process for mining historical change information to suggest CIs for future change sets based on a ranking model. Support and con dence measures are used to make the suggestions. - Empirical results from applying the proposed change impact analysis process to industrial data. Our results show that the change sets in the CMDB were highly predictive, and that with a confidence threshold of 80 % and a half life of 12 months, an overall recall of 69. 8 % and a precision of 88. 5 % were achieved. - An overview of lessons learned from using a CMDB, and the observations we made while working with the CMDB...|$|E
