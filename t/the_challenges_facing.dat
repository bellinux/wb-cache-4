25|$|Azad's {{education}} had been shaped {{for him to}} become a cleric, but his rebellious nature and affinity for politics turned him towards journalism.

Espousing the ideals of Indian nationalism, Azad's publications were aimed at encouraging young Muslims into fighting for independence and Hindu-Muslim unity. His work helped improve the relationship between Hindus and Muslims in Bengal, which had been soured by the controversy surrounding the partition of Bengal and the issue of separate communal electorates.|$|E
