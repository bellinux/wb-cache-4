Gotye later signed <b>to</b> <b>Creative</b> Vibes as a solo artist and released his debut studio album Boardface in June 2003.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that a key factor in the {{development}} of competitive advantage is the provision of an environment that encourages employees <b>to</b> be <b>creative.</b> Leaders {{play a crucial role in}} cultivating an environment that encourages subordinates <b>to</b> be <b>creative.</b> Based on a survey of 219 managers in privately owned enterprises in China, this study investigates how trust in subordinates in terms of their reliability and their loyalty to the leader is related to leaders encouraging subordinates <b>to</b> be <b>creative.</b> The findings reveal positive relationships between these two types of trust in subordinates and leaders encouraging subordinates <b>to</b> be <b>creative.</b> The findings also reveal that attitude to formalization moderated the relationship between trust in subordinates and encouraging them <b>to</b> be <b>creative...</b>|$|R

5|$|Fish and Shawn McGrath {{collaborated on}} a puzzle game that became Fez. When McGrath left the project due <b>to</b> <b>creative</b> differences, Fish, the game's artist, pursued a {{platform}} game direction with Renaud Bédard, the game's programmer, {{who wrote the}} game's level editor and game engine from scratch. Levels were built in 3D by extruding surfaces with Photoshop-created textures. Bédard and Fish were joined by three different animators and other collaborators. The game was first announced in June 2007 and won an award at the 2008 Independent Games Festival and entered the public spotlight. Fish created a studio, Polytron Corporation, and was later aided by nearby developer-publisher Trapdoor when Polytron ran out of money. Fez won several more prerelease awards, including the 2012 Seumas McNally Grand Prize.|$|E
5|$|In 1896 Synge visited Italy {{to study}} the {{language}} for a time before returning to Paris. Later that year he met W. B.

That year he joined with Yeats, Augusta, Lady Gregory, and George William Russell to form the Irish National Theatre Society, which later established the Abbey Theatre. He also wrote some pieces of literary criticism for Gonne's Irlande Libre and other journals, as well as unpublished poems and prose in a decadent fin de siècle style. (These writings were eventually gathered in the 1960s for his Collected Works.) He also attended lectures at the Sorbonne by the noted Celtic scholar Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville.|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{of the level of}} creative thinking and motivation <b>to</b> learn <b>creative</b> thinking, and the relationship between both of them, in Jordan is still insufficient due to lack of interest and research among researchers and scholars. Therefore, this study examines the relationship between creative thinking and motivation <b>to</b> learn <b>creative</b> thinking among pre-school children in Jordan. A total of 102 students from one kindergarten was examined. Parental consent was obtained before the study was conducted. The result from the analysis posited that there is a medium level of motivation <b>to</b> learn <b>creative</b> thinking (64. 7 %). The means of TCAM scores and its dimensions were: TCAM overall score (M= 68. 24, SD= 14. 615), Fluency (M= 17. 53, SD= 4. 776), Originality (M= 25. 7, SD= 8. 264), and Imagination (M= 25. 01, SD= 3. 793). In addition, there is a positive statistically significant correlation (0. 573) among the total of creative thinking scores and the total of motivation <b>to</b> learn <b>creative</b> thinking. Spearman correlation was used to evaluate the overall relationship between creative thinking and motivation <b>to</b> learn <b>creative</b> thinking. A strong positive correlation was found between creative thinking and motivation <b>to</b> learn <b>creative</b> thinking scores of pre-school children. The present study has also discussed the findings, the limitations and the recommendations...|$|R

5|$|The novel Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk was {{published}} in 1996. Before its publication, a 20th Century Fox book scout sent a galley proof of the novel <b>to</b> <b>creative</b> executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof {{as a candidate for}} a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers Lawrence Bender and Art Linson, who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to Laura Ziskin, head of the division Fox 2000, who listened to the tape and purchased the rights to Fight Club from Palahniuk for $10,000.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{received}} a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, {{and others said}} that the requirement to actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging. Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals. Some reviewers said {{that a lack of}} depth made combat gradually become repetitive; they said that even when combat is funny and engaging, {{by the end of the}} game the battles can become routine. Joystiq stated that defense was more interesting than offense because it relied on time-sensitive reactions <b>to</b> <b>creative</b> enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation. Destructoid said there are too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long. GameSpot found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents. Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in combat, such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured it always felt fun. The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing, and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available. Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>creative</b> differences, Kuntz {{backed out}} of the project, but created an {{adventure}} module that would be published {{at the same time as}} Gygax's first book. Gygax continued to painstakingly put Castle Zagyg together on his own, but even this slow and laborious process came to a complete halt when Gygax suffered a serious stroke in April 2004 and then another one a few weeks later. Although he returned to his keyboard after a seven-month convalescence, his output was reduced from 14-hour work days to only one or two hours per day. Finally in 2005, Castle Zagyg Part I: Yggsburgh, the first book in the six-book series, appeared. Later that year, Troll Lord Games also published Castle Zagyg: Dark Chateau (2005), the adventure module written for the Yggsburgh setting by Rob Kuntz. Jeff Talanian helped with the creation of the dungeon, eventually resulting in publication of the limited edition CZ9: The East Marks Gazetteer (2007).|$|E

In February 2008, director Martin Scorsese announced his intention to produce a documentary movie on Marley. The film was set to be released on 6 February 2010, on {{what would have been}} Marley's 65th birthday. However, Scorsese dropped out due to scheduling problems. He was replaced by Jonathan Demme, who dropped out due <b>to</b> <b>creative</b> differences with producer Steve Bing during the beginning of editing. Kevin Macdonald replaced Demme and the film, Marley, was released on 20 April 2012. In March 2008, The Weinstein Company announced its plans to produce a biopic of Bob Marley, based on the book No Woman No Cry: My Life With Bob Marley by Rita Marley. Rudy Langlais will produce the script by Lizzie Borden and Rita Marley will be executive producer. In 2011, ex-girlfriend and filmmaker Esther Anderson, along with Gian Godoy, made the documentary Bob Marley: The Making of a Legend, which premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival.|$|E
