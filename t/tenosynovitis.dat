5000|$|Tenosynovitis is the inflammation of the fluid-filled sheath (called the synovium) that {{surrounds}} a tendon, typically leading to joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. <b>Tenosynovitis</b> {{can be either}} infectious or noninfectious. Common clinical manifestations of noninfectious <b>tenosynovitis</b> include de Quervain tendinopathy and stenosing <b>tenosynovitis</b> (more commonly known as trigger finger) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} trigger finger is unclear but several causes have been proposed. It {{has also been}} called stenosing <b>tenosynovitis</b> (specifically digital <b>tenosynovitis</b> stenosans), but {{this may be a}} misnomer, as {{inflammation}} is not a predominant feature.|$|E
50|$|The {{mainstay}} {{of treatment for}} <b>tenosynovitis</b> includes symptom alleviation, antibiotic therapy, and surgery. Mild <b>tenosynovitis</b> causing small scale swelling can be treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce inflammation and as an analgesic. Resting the affected tendons is essential for recovery; a brace is often recommended. Physical or occupational therapy may also be beneficial in reducing symptoms.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} manifestation of {{infectious}} <b>tenosynovitis</b> {{is in the}} flexor tendons of the fingers, though infections of other tendon sheaths have been reported as well. The four cardinal signs of infectious flexor <b>tenosynovitis</b> are tenderness to touch along the flexor aspect of the finger, symmetric enlargement of the affected finger, the finger being held in slight flexion at rest, and severe pain with passive extension. Fever may also be present but is uncommon.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tenosynovitis,</b> {{inflammatory}} irritation of the synovial sheath, {{is relatively}} {{common in the}} third compartment after repetitive activities such as drum playing.|$|E

50|$|Stenosing <b>tenosynovitis</b> (also {{known as}} trigger finger or trigger thumb) is a painful {{condition}} {{caused by the}} inflammation (<b>tenosynovitis)</b> and progressive restriction of the superficial and deep flexors fibrous tendon sheath adjacent to the A1 pulley at a metacarpal head. Repetitive forceful compression, tensile stress, and resistive flexion, causes inflammation, swelling, and microtrauma, that results in thickening (commonly a nodular formation) of the tendon distal to the pulley and stenosis of the tendon sheath leading to a painful digital base, limitation of finger movements, triggering, snapping, locking, and deformity progressively.|$|E
50|$|Treatment for {{infectious}} <b>tenosynovitis</b> is {{more effective}} the earlier the condition is identified and treated. Factors that worsen patient outcomes include being older than 43, having diabetes mellitus, and a polymicrobial infection.|$|E
50|$|Finkelstein's test {{is one way}} to {{determine}} if there is <b>tenosynovitis</b> in the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons of the wrist. These two tendons belong to the first dorsal compartment.|$|E

5000|$|Noninfectious <b>tenosynovitis</b> {{can arise}} from overuse or {{secondary}} to other systemic inflammatory {{conditions such as}} arthritis or arthritis. If left untreated, the tendons may undergo stenosis, causing conditions such as de Quervain’s and trigger finger.|$|E

50|$|Flexor <b>tenosynovitis</b> is {{a common}} finding in the {{patients}} with Linburg-Comstock syndrome.

5000|$|Diagnosis of <b>tenosynovitis</b> is {{typically}} made clinically after a thorough patient history. Aspirated fluid {{can also be}} cultured to identify the infectious organism. X-rays are typically unremarkable but can help rule out a broken bone or a foreign body ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tenosynovitis</b> most {{commonly}} {{results from the}} introduction of bacteria into a sheath through a puncture or laceration wound, though bacteria can also be spread from adjacent tissue or via hematogenous spread. The clinical presentation is therefore as acute infection following trauma. The infection can be mono- or polymicrobial and can {{vary depending on the}} nature of the trauma. The most common pathogenic agent is staphylococcus aureus introduced from the skin. Other bacteria linked to infectious <b>tenosynovitis</b> include Pasteurella multocida (associated with animal bites), Eikenella spp. (associated with IV drug use), and Mycobacterium marinum (associated with wounds exposed to fresh or salt water). Additionally, sexually active patients are at risk for hematogenous spread due to Neisseria gonorrhea (see infectious arthritis).|$|E
50|$|The disease {{mechanism}} (pathophysiology) of RS3PE remains unknown. One study {{suggested a}} possible role for vascular endothelial growth factor.

50|$|Any of the dorsal {{compartments}} of {{the wrist}} can develop tenosynovial inflammation.
