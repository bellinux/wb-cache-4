40|$|Avianmeta{{pneumovirus}} (aMPV), {{also known}} as avian pneumovirus or <b>turkey</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> virus, is the causative agent of <b>turkey</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> and is associated with swollen head syndrome in chickens. Since its discovery in the 1970 s, aMPV has been recognized as an economically important pathogen in the poultry industry worldwide. The conserved region VI (CR VI) of the large (L) polymerase proteins of paramyxoviruses catalyzes methyltransferase (MTase) activities that typically methylate viral mRNAs at guanine N- 7 (G-N- 7) and ribose 2 =-O positions. In this study, we generated a panel of recombinant aMPV (raMPV) Colorado strains carrying mutations in the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding site in the CR VI of L protein. These recombi-nant viruses were specifically defective in ribose 2 =-O, but not G-N- 7 methylation and were genetically stable and highly attenu-ated in cell culture and viral replication in {{the upper and lower}} respiratory tracts of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) young turkeys. Importantly, turkeys vaccinated with these MTase-defective raMPVs triggered a high level of neutralizing antibody and were completely protected from challenge with homologous aMPV Colorado strain and heterologous aMPVMinnesota strain. Collec-tively, our results indicate (i) that aMPV lacking 2 =-O methylation is highly attenuated in vitro and in vivo and (ii) that inhibi-tion of mRNA capMTase can serve as a novel target to rationally design live attenuated vaccines for aMPV and perhaps other paramyxoviruses...|$|E

40|$|Avian Pneumovirus (APV) is {{the casual}} agent of <b>Turkey</b> <b>Rhinotracheitis</b> (TRT), and also causes a {{respiratory}} infection in chickens, which {{can result in}} Swollen Head Syndrome. A survey of APV infection in Italian turkey and broiler farms, in a highly populated area of Northern Italy (Verona Province) is reported. Nine turkey farms and 6 broiler farms were sampled. Sixteen birds from each group were doubly swabbed from the choanal cleft for virus isolation on tracheal organ cultures (TOC) and RT nested PCR (A and B type specific) using extracted RNA. At the same time blood samples were collected for a blocking ELISA serological assay. The broiler samples for virological assays were treated with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) antiserum raised against serotypes prevalent in the areas sampled, thus avoiding competitive growth of IBV on TOC. Ciliostasis on TOC was taken as the indicator {{of the presence of}} the virus, and confirmation was by indirect immunofluorescence. APV was isolated and detected by RT-PCR in 19 day-old turkeys, and in 34, 42 and 48 day-old broilers. All APV strains were found to be type B. All turkeys of more than 4 weeks old were APV positive by ELISA.

Sequencing showed these to be unrelated to the previously applied vaccine. Sequencing of the entire genome of a typical later isolate showed numerous SH and G protein gene differences when compared to both a 1987 Italian field isolate and the vaccine in common use. Experimental challenge of vaccinated birds with recent virus showed that protection was inferior to that seen after challenge with the earlier 1987 isolate.

40|$|Abstract: A {{case-control study}} was {{conducted}} to identify risk factors associated with prevalence of swollen head syndrome (SHS) in broiler chickens in Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia (EPSA). A total of 200 birds-originated from 25 broiler flocks- confirmed cases and 200 controls were used in this study.

40|$|Avian Metapneumovirus (aMPV) is {{the casual}} agent of <b>Turkey</b> <b>Rhinotracheitis</b> (TRT), and also causes a {{respiratory}} infection in chickens, which {{can result in}} Swollen Head Syndrome (SHS). The current information on prevalence of aMPV in broiler in Italy is fragmentary and the impact on production remains unknown. In order to draw an epidemiological picture of aMPV in broiler flocks, starting from 2014, a survey has been performed mainly in the highly poultry populated areas in the North of Italy. Swabs collected during one-off and longitudinal studies were tested using A and B subtype specific Real Time RT-PCR. Samples were also tested for Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) using PCRs followed by sequencing. When possible, production data and respiratory diseases were recorded. Results confirmed the high prevalence of aMPV in broiler older than 30 days in absence of field IBV. All viruses detected were of B subtype. To evaluate the genetic variability in Italian aMPV strains, the fusion (F) and attachment (G) gene nucleotide sequences of selected isolates were determined. These were compared with sequences obtained from turkeys sampled {{in the same area}} and in the same period and with previously published aMPV sequences...|$|E
40|$|Avian Metapneumovirus (aMPV), {{also called}} <b>Turkey</b> <b>Rhinotracheitis</b> Virus (TRTV), is an upper {{respiratory}} tract infection of turkeys, chickens and other avian species. Five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were created against the Brazilian isolate (SHS-BR- 121) of aMPV, MAbs 1 A 5 B 8; 1 C 1 C 4; 2 C 2 E 9 and 2 A 4 C 3 of IgG 1 and MAb 1 C 1 F 8 of IgG 2 a. Four Mabs (1 A 5 B 8; 1 C 1 C 4; 2 C 2 E 9 and 2 A 4 C 3) showed neutralizing activity and three (1 A 5 B 8; 1 C 1 C 4 and 2 A 4 C 3) inhibited cellular fusion in vitro. These MAbs were used to investigate antigenic relationship among three strains (SHS-BR- 121, STG 854 / 88 and TRT 1439 / 91) of aMPV subtypes A and B using cross-neutralization test.

40|$|Empirically derived live avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) {{vaccines}} {{developed during}} the late 80 s and early 90 s have generally performed well in controlling <b>turkey</b> <b>rhinotracheitis.</b> Nonetheless, unstable attenuation was previously demonstrated in an AMPV subtype A vaccine.

The publication of the full genome sequence for the VCO 3 vaccine progenitor facilitated a conclusive investigation of two AMPVs isolated from poults on a farm which had been vaccinated with VCO 3 derived vaccine. Full genome sequencing of the isolates and their comparison to sequences of the vaccine and its progenitor, confirmed their vaccine origin. After determining the absence of extraneous infectious agents, one of these virus isolates was inoculated into 1 -day-old turkeys in disease secure isolators and shown to cause disease with a severity similar to that caused by virulent field virus. This suggests that instability in live AMPV vaccines may be generalized and highlights the need for availability of vaccine progenitor sequences for the field assessment of all live viral vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) causes <b>turkey</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> and is {{associated}} with swollen head syndrome in chickens, which is usually accompanied by secondary infections that increase mortality. AMPVs circulating in Brazilian vaccinated and nonvaccinated commercial chicken and turkey farms were detected using a universal reverse transcriptase (RT) -PCR assay that can detect the four recognized subtypes of AMPV. The AMPV status of 228 farms with respiratory and reproductive disturbances was investigated. AMPV was detected in broiler, hen, breeder, and turkey farms from six different geographic regions of Brazil. The detected viruses were subtyped using a nested RT-PCR assay and sequence analysis of the G gene. Only subtypes A and B were detected in both vaccinated and nonvaccinated farms. AMPV-A and AMPV-B were detected in 15 and 23 farms, respectively, while both subtypes were simultaneously found in one hen farm. Both vaccine and field viruses were detected in nonvaccinated farms. In five cases, the detected subtype was different than the vaccine subtype. Field subtype B virus was detected mainly during {{the final years of}} the survey period. These viruses showed high molecular similarity (more than 96 % nucleotide similarity) among themselves and formed a unique phylogenetic group, suggesting that they may have originated from a common strain.

40|$|Since the 1980 s {{a number}} of live {{attenuated}} type A and B Avian Pneumovirus (APV) vaccines have been developed in Europe and these have generally afforded good protection. All have been produced by repeated passages of field virus in a laboratory culture system to achieve various degrees of attenuation.

When tested under experimental conditions, these empirically derived vaccines were shown to be fully protective whilst not causing detectable disease themselves. However, they have not performed as well when used {{in the field and}} unstable attenuation has been considered to be a possible factor. This paper describes the first evidence of reversion of an APV vaccine in the field. First, systematic evidence of extended vaccine virus persistence in the field arose from longitudinal studies performed in the UK in 1995. Secondly, from an outbreak of <b>Turkey</b> <b>Rhinotracheitis</b> (TRT) in an Italian turkey flock previously vaccinated at day old, we isolated an APV which proved to be a vaccine derivative by sequencing.

40|$|In March 1978, {{a number}} of turkeys with severe {{respiratory}} symptoms affecting over 80 % of the flock were investigated for a possible causative agent. With the standard techniques used for the isolation of bacteriae, mycoplasmae and viruses, only Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma meleagridis and Newcastle disease virus were isolated. Tracheal organ cultures were subsequently prepared from 27 - day-old turkey embryos and inoculated with sinus exudate from affected turkeys. After an incubation period of 4 days a virus was isolated with which the typical symptoms, as observed in the field, could be reproduced in susceptible turkeys after 3 - 5 days. Following primary isolation in tracheal organ cultures, the virus grew readily in embryonated eggs and Vero cells. With the electron microscope, virus-like particles, varying in size from 40 nm- 500 nm, were observed, having a pleomorphic shape and studded with fine surface projections.

A total of 210 one-day-old heavy-type Hybrid Converter male turkeys were randomly divided into three different dietary treat-ment groups, each consisting of 7 replicate pens of 10 birds per pen. Until 4 wk of age, all birds were fed a commercial diet formulated to meet nutrient requirements. From 5 to 12 wk of age, diets were composed of wheat (ground-pelleted or whole grain) and protein-fat-mineral-vitamin concentrate. The total wheat concentration in diets was 500 or 600 g/kg in the feeding periods of 5 - 8 and 9 - 12 wk of birds ’ age, respectively. Whole grain wheat had a 0, 50 or 100 % share of the total wheat amount in the daily ration in treatment groups W 0, W 50 or W 100, respectively. Commercial vaccines against ND (Newcastle disease) and TRT (<b>Turkey</b> <b>rhinotracheitis)</b> were administered to turkeys via the drinking water on days 20 and 30, respectively. Over the entire experiment, a significant linear decrease was observed in body weight gains (BWG) with increasing dietary levels of whole grain wheat.

40|$|A serologically {{distinct}} avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) {{was isolated}} in the United States after an outbreak of <b>turkey</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> (TRT) in February 1997. The newly recognized U. S. virus was subsequently demonstrated to be genetically distinct from European subtypes and was designated aMPV serotype C (aMPV/C). We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the cell attachment glycoprotein (G) of aMPV/C (Colorado strain and three Minnesota isolates) and predicted amino acid sequence by sequencing cloned cDNAs synthesized from intracellular RNA of aMPV/C-infected cells. The nucleotide sequence comprised 1, 321 nucleotides with only one predicted open reading frame encoding a protein of 435 amino acids, with a predicted Mr of 48, 840. The structural characteristics of the predicted G protein of aMPV/C {{were similar to those}} of the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) attachment G protein, including two mucin-like regions (heparin-binding domains) flanking both sides of a CX 3 C chemokine motif present in a conserved hydrophobic pocket. Comparison of the deduced G-protein amino acid sequence of aMPV/C with those of aMPV serotypes A, B, and D, as well as hRSV revealed overall predicted amino acid sequence identities ranging from 4 to 16. 5 %, suggesting a distant relationship. However, G-protein sequence identities ranged from 72 to 97 % when aMPV/C was compared to other members within the aMPV/C subtype or 21 % for the recently identified human MPV (hMPV) G protein. Ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide changes were greater than one in the G gene when comparing the more recent Minnesota isolates to the original Colorado isolate. Epidemiologically, this indicates positive selection among U. S. isolates since the first outbreak of TRT in the United States...|$|E
40|$|The {{putative}} attachment protein of the avian pneumovirus {{that causes}} <b>turkey</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> is, by analogy with mammalian pneumoviruses, {{expected to be}} the major antigenic determinant. We report the nucleotide sequence of the attachment (G) protein genes of five different continental European isolates and compare them with the previously published sequence of the G gene for the focal variant of a U. K. isolate. The nucleotide sequences and the predicted amino acid sequences indicate that {{there are at least two}} distinct subgroups, similar to the grouping described for human respiratory syncytial (RS) virus. The U. K. and French isolates form one group and the isolates from Spain, Italy and Hungary form a second. The two subgroups can be easily distinguished on the basis of restriction enzyme digestion of PCR-generated products representing the full-length gene. Within the subgroups the predicted G proteins were highly conserved(98. 5 to 99. 7 % amino acid identity) compared to the levels of identity of RS virus G proteins in the same subgroup (80 to 95 %). Between the avian pneumovirus subgroups described here there was an unexpected degree of divergence, the average amino acid identity between members of the two groups being only 38 %. This compares with the 53 % conservation seen between members of the RS virus subgroups A and B. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences showed that the G proteins of members of the two avian pneumovirus subgroups had similar structural features. All proteins had an amino-terminal membrane anchor and the positions of cysteine residues were highly conserved. The potential importance of the high level of variation between the two subgroups in terms of epidemiology of the disease is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Avian Metapneumovirus (AMPV) is {{the casual}} agent of <b>Turkey</b> <b>Rhinotracheitis</b> (TRT), and also causes a {{respiratory}} infection in chickens, which {{can result in}} Swollen Head Syndrome (SHS). A survey of AMPV infection in 122 turkey and 48 broiler farms, in a highly densely populated area of Northern Italy, performed from January 2011 to February 2013, is reported. Positive AMPV samples were detected using or RT-nested PCR or qRT-PCR both able to detect and differentiate AMPV subtype A and B. All samples but one resulted positive for AMPV subtype B confirming the high prevalence of this subtype in Italy. Only one AMPV subtype A was detected in a turkey farm located in Verona province. The majority of AMPV detections were of field origin, circulating mainly from 9 to 12 weeks of age in turkeys and from 5 to 7 weeks of age in broilers, and associated with respiratory symptoms. Turkeys were all vaccinated at 1 day {{of age in the}} hatchery. The reasons for vaccine failure could be field virus changes in key antigenic regions that allow replication and leading to disease in well vaccinated birds. Our study revealed that VC 03 vaccine strain can be detected in turkeys up to many weeks after vaccination, with a high prevalence in the first weeks after hatch. This confirmed the pattern seen previously for subtype A and B live vaccine which has been shown to persist on farm for 4 - 5 weeks. Uniquely in this study, apparently vaccine derived strains were observed in older turkeys of up to 84 days of age. It is unlikely that a vaccine persists on the same farm for such a long period, so it is likely that as observed in a previous study for AMPV subtype A, a vaccine-derived virus was present in the environment being able to circulate and affect turkey farms...|$|E
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} and deduced {{amino acid}} sequences of three genes of <b>turkey</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> virus (TRTV) {{together with the}} nucleotide sequences of the relevant intergenic regions were determined. The deduced amino acid sequence {{of one of the}} genes shows significant identity (42 %) to that of the 22 K protein of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The TRTV 22 K gene, like that of RSV, has a second open reading frame, although the amino acid sequence deduced from this reading frame does not show any similarity to the equivalent predicted RSV protein. The other two genes and their deduced amino acid sequences do not show any sequence similarity to the genes of other pneumoviruses. However, the hydrophobicity profiles of the predicted proteins do show similarities to those of the small hydrophobic (SH) and attachment protein (G) genes of RSV. The TRTV G gene is 1193 nucleotides in length and encodes a protein of 391 amino acids (M(r) 42 984), which is rather larger than the RSV G protein (predicted M(r) 36000). The TRTV SH gene is 589 nucleotides in length, encoding a protein of 174 amino acids (M(r) 18 797), which is considerably larger than the size of the RSV SH protein (M(r) 7500). The sequences of the intergenic regions derived from clones of polycistronic mRNAs and polymerase chain reaction products obtained with primers from different genes reveal the order on the virus genome to be 3 ' F- 22 K-SH-G 5 '. This differs from the gene order of paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses, which lack a 22 K gene (and in some cases a SH gene), and the pneumoviruses RSV and pneumonia virus of mice, which have the F and 22 K genes located after the G gene...|$|E
40|$|Avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) causes {{an upper}} {{respiratory}} tract infection in turkeys leading to <b>turkey</b> <b>rhinotracheitis.</b> In other avian species, including chickens, it is also involved in the aetiology of multifactorial diseases such as swollen head syndrome. Sensitivity of wild birds to AMPV and their role in maintaining and spreading the virus to poultry is still a matter of debate. Recently the sensitivity of pigeons to AMPV of subtype A or B has been claimed, based on very limited PCR detections from wild or experimentally infected birds. In order to have conclusive evidence regarding the sensitivity of pigeons to AMPV of subtype B {{and its role in}} spreading the virus to turkeys, two experimental trials were planned in secure isolation conditions. In trial 1 two isolators were modified to host turkeys and pigeons in the same environment, separated only by a net. Drinkers were shared between groups. 16 Pigeons were infected with AMPV and housed in one isolator with naïve turkeys. Similarly turkeys were infected and housed with naïve pigeons. Additional turkeys and pigeons were kept in different isolators as uninfected controls. Post-infection clinical signs, virus shedding and immune response were assessed for three weeks. In trial 2, commercial two-weeks old turkeys were divided in two groups of ten and housed in two different isolators. Birds in isolator A were challenged as previously described. Four days post-infection, five 7 weeks old naïve pigeons were introduced in the isolator A and kept with the infected turkeys for 24 hours, then removed, sprayed with 0, 5 % of Wirkon S solution. After 10 minutes, pigeons were rinsed with water, dried, and introduced in the isolator B, where 10 naïve turkeys were housed. Clinical sign were monitored for 10 days. Pigeons were found refractory to AMPV experimental infection and neither able to spread the virus to naïve turkeys. Our paper shows that pigeons are highly unlikely to play any relevant role in the environmental spread of subtype B AMPV.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis identifies some properties of the major polypeptides of pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) and of <b>turkey</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> (TRT) virus. The PVM glycoproteins have been studied in particular detail while the results obtained with TRT virus provide a preliminary description of the polypeptides of this virus. Twelve major PVM specific polypeptides designated L, G 1, G 2, F 1, N, 39 K, 35 K, M, 20 K, 19 K, 16 K and 12 K were identified. In addition PVM specific polypeptides designated 25 K, 24 K, 23 K, 18 K and 17 K were sometimes detected. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the G 1 /G 2, 39 K and M polypeptides were produced. The a ility of a monoclonal antibody to precipitate G 1 and G 2 suggested that these two glycosylated proteins were related and this was confirmed by tryptic peptide mapping. G 2 was shown {{to be derived from}} G 1 in pulse chase experiments and a similar relationship between two higher mobility polypeptides synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin was observed. The G protein may have a precursor since G 1 did not appear immediately following a pulse labelling. The precursor could not however be identified. An additional minor glycosylated polypeptide of 42 K was found {{to be related to the}} G protein. The F 1 protein appeared to be poorly glycosylated and a difference in mobility of the polypeptide synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin did not appear to be directly due to a lack of N-linked oligosaccharides. The polypeptide migrated more slowly under non-reducing conditions but no evidence of a small disulphide bonded polypeptide was found in contrast to the situation with other paramyxoviruses. This polypeptide appeared to be the major PVM protein expressed on the cell surface and was associated with G 1 and G 2 as the major protein in a particulate fraction of the infected cell supernatant. Tentative relationships were suggested between the 39 K, 35 K and 25 K polypeptides, the M and 24 K polypeptides and the 20 K and 19 K polypeptides. This together with the observation that the 12 K polypeptide was not a primary gene product suggested that there may be about 11 PVM polypeptides. The N or 39 K and the 20 K or 19 K polypeptides were observed to be phosphorylated. Twelve possible TRT virus specific polypeptides of 150 K, 129 K, 95 K, 83 K, 57 K, 45 K, 38 K, 35 K, 3 DK, 23 K, 19 K and 15 K were identified. The 150 K, 95 K, 83 K, 57 K, 45 K and 15 K polypeptides were glycosylated with the latter three polypeptides showing a similar relationship to the F 1, 2, F 1 and F 2 polypeptides of paramyxoviruses. A broad glycosylated band designated the 31 K polypeptide was identified that was similar to a smeared band observed on prolonged exposure of immunoprecipitates of PVM polypeptides labelled with [3 H]-glucosamine. The 35 K and 19 K polypeptides were observed to be phosphorylated. PVM may be more closely related to RS virus than TRT virus since anti-PVM serum irnmunoprecipitated the RS virus N polypeptide but not any TRT virus polypeptides. The PVM 39 K polypeptide and the RS virus P protein were recognised by a monoclonal antibody providing further evidence of a relationship between PVM and RS virus. ...|$|E
