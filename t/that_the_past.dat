5|$|Remains of Nesomys narindaensis {{have been}} found at the sites of Antsingiavo, Ambongonambakoa, and Ambatomainty in northwestern Madagascar, which are late Pleistocene (126,000 to 10,000 years ago) and Holocene (less than 10,000 years ago) in age. Nesomys is a rare element of the rodent fauna, which is {{dominated}} by multiple species of Eliurus and Macrotarsomys. Modern Nesomys live {{on the ground in}} eastern (N.audeberti and N.rufus) and western (N.lambertoni) Madagascar. The only surviving western species, N.lambertoni, is restricted to a relict humid karst area; the presence of N.narindaensis and Brachyuromys mahajambaensis suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> environment in northwestern Madagascar was also more humid. Subfossil remains of Nesomys have been recorded from some other localities in northwestern Madagascar, but these have not been described.|$|E
25|$|The B-theory {{of time is}} {{the name}} given {{to one of two}} {{positions}} regarding philosophy of time. B-theorists argue that the flow of time is an illusion, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> present and future are equally real, and that time is tenseless. This would mean that temporal becoming is not an objective feature of reality.|$|E

25|$|Nomological {{determinism}} is {{the most}} common form of causal determinism. It is the notion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. Quantum mechanics and various interpretations thereof pose a serious challenge to this view. Nomological determinism is sometimes illustrated by the thought experiment of Laplace's demon. Nomological determinism is sometimes called 'scientific' determinism, although that is a misnomer. Physical determinism is generally used synonymously with nomological determinism (its opposite being physical indeterminism).|$|E
25|$|Causal {{determinism}} is {{the concept}} that events within a given paradigm are bound by causality {{in such a way}} that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or self-caused. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. Quantum mechanics poses a serious challenge to this view.|$|E
25|$|Tables {{published}} by the government's National Center for Health Statistics show that life expectancy at birth was 47.3 years in 1900, rose to 68.2 by 1950 and reached 77.3 in 2002. The latest annual report of the Social Security Agency (SSA) trustees projects that life expectancy will increase just {{six years in the}} next seven decades, to 83 in 2075. A separate set of projections, by the Census Bureau, shows more rapid growth. The Census Bureau projection is that the longer life spans projected for 2075 by the Social Security Administration will be reached in 2050. Other experts, however, think <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> gains in life expectancy cannot be repeated, and add that the adverse effect on the system's finances may be partly offset if health improvements or reduced retirement benefits induce people to stay in the workforce longer.|$|E

According to him, [...] "The time spent with a father will teach you a certain understanding of live and how to cope and deal with things. The lack of a father being there can also teach you how to deal with life – and that’s what 'Sins Of The Father' is about... That statement was made because that’s something that I felt."

500|$|Producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi {{noted that}} the {{production}} team began working with the game using a PC-based engine. He {{said that this was}} the first PlayStation 3 game developed by Capcom, and that making this transition was a [...] "hard step", particularly because no member of the producing team was familiar with the console's capabilities. As the first Devil May Cry not to be released for PlayStation 2, the team wanted to introduce a new character for newcomers. This allowed them to try new play mechanics that and expand more the series' plot. On September 6, 2006, Japanese video game magazine Famitsu reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> games' main character, Dante, would not be the protagonist in Devil May Cry 4. Instead, a new character named Nero, voiced and motion captured by Johnny Yong Bosch, took the lead.|$|E
500|$|During a {{state visit}} to England in 1866, Abu Bakar was {{commonly}} addressed as the [...] "Maharaja" [...] of Johor {{and led him}} to realise that the Malay title of Temenggong was hardly known to the Western World. He contemplated a change of another title, which led him to send his cousin, Ungku Haji Muhammad and the Dato Bentara, Dato Jaafar to meet the Bugis historian, Raja Ali Haji who was residing in Riau. Raja Ali supported Abu Bakar's cause, after they did a cross examination and concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> office holders had wielded actual control over the affairs of Johor, rather than the Sultans of the Bendahara dynasty. In addition, questions pertaining to Abu Bakar's pursuits to clamour for recognition were also sidelined as {{he was able to}} trace his ancestry to the first Sultan of the Bendahara dynasty, Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah IV by his patrilineal ancestors. The Sultan of Lingga, gave his approval for a formal recognition of Abu Bakar as the Maharaja of Johor, after Ungku Haji and Dato Jaafar travelled to Lingga and presented their claims. Abu Bakar also secured approval from the Governor of the Straits Settlements for his change in title, and was officially proclaimed as the Maharaja of Johor on 30 June 1868.|$|E

500|$|CNN's Henry Hanks {{wrote the}} episode [...] "is {{reason enough to}} bring this series back for another season," [...] and praised Noble's {{performance}} as Emmy-worthy; Hanks also loved the [...] "genius" [...] musical score written by composers Michael Giacchino and Chris Tilton. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded the episode with an A-, explaining that, like the other reviewers, he loved the opening sequence with Peter on the lake, the newest mythology details, {{as well as how}} Walternate discovered the prime universe. Murray also loved the [...] "mood" [...] of the episode, but had minor problems with the plot, as he thought it was now harder to believe Olivia, Peter, and Walter were strangers {{to each other in the}} first season. James Poniewozik of Time magazine concluded that the episode [...] "was not the revelation that 'Peter' was, though a phase-shifting Olivia’s mistaking of Walternate for Walter was one of the series’ most mindblowing moments (and, again, a Lostian bit of disorienting sleight of hand). But it was again an effective detour in which Fringe reminded us that time has parallels just as space does, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> is emotionally overlaid on the present just as its Over There is overlaid on our world." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 30, 2004, {{following}} the island being moved in [...] "There's No Place Like Home", {{the survivors of}} Oceanic Flight 815, the freighter team, and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) begin to erratically jump through time - something Faraday likens to standing on a skipping record - [...] while the Others are unaffected. The first jump takes them {{to the day when}} the Beechcraft carrying Mr. Eko's brother crashes onto the island. John Locke is shot in the leg by Ethan Rom (William Mapother), who has not yet met him and therefore does not recognize him. Meanwhile, James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway), Juliet and the freighter team head to the [...] in order to determine when they are. A second jump brings the group forward in time to after the destruction of the station, while Locke is approached by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who recognizes Locke and treats his wound. He informs Locke that they will be strangers at their next meeting, and explains {{that the only way to}} stop the erratic movements through time is to bring back everyone who has left the island, and to do that Locke will have to die. Another jump brings them to the past, and they find that the Swan station is now intact. Sawyer tries to contact Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), who is inside, but Daniel asserts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> can not be changed, and since Desmond did not know Sawyer already when they first met, Sawyer cannot be successful. No one answers, and everyone heads back to the beach. Daniel stays behind and knocks again, and Desmond emerges dressed in a hazmat suit, thus belying Daniel's original assertion. Daniel tells him that if Desmond's future self and the survivors of 815 make it off the island on the helicopter then he should go to Oxford University and find Daniel's mother, in order to help the survivors. Another jump occurs just before Daniel can give his mother's name.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fact that}} English has words like {{before and after}} that are (currently or archaically) polysemous between 'front/earlier' or 'back/later' may seem to refute the claims {{regarding}} Aymara uniqueness. However, these words relate events to other events and {{are part of the}} moving-events metaphor. In fact, when before means in front of ego, it can mean only future. For instance, our future is laid out before us while our past is behind us. Parallel Aymara examples describe future days as qhipa uru, literally 'back days', and they are sometimes accompanied by gestures to behind the speaker. The same applies to Quechua speakers, whose expression qhipa p'unchaw corresponds directly to Aymara qhipa uru. [...] Possibly, the metaphor is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> is visible to us (in front of our eyes) while the future is not.|$|E
