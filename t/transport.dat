Currently, commuters are charged a second time when they make such transfers. He added that the Public <b>Transport</b> Council (PTC) will review distance-based fare transfer rules to ensure they continue to facilitate “fast, seamless” public <b>transport</b> journeys. The review of distance-based fare rules on MRT lines {{is expected to be}} completed in the first quarter in 2018.|$|E

Although the <b>transport</b> of freight declined slightly year on year between 2004 and 2006, in the decade since 1996 air freight has increased by 31 per cent. During {{the period in which}} government policy was being formulated the number of passengers exceeded 200million, and in 2006 the industry handled over 236million passengers (up 3 per cent from the previous year), with nearly 2.4million air <b>transport</b> movements (up 1.8 per cent).|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a multifunctional <b>transporting</b> system with multiple drivable <b>transporting</b> units (1), {{each of which}} has a coupling device (5) in a front and a rear region, said <b>transporting</b> units (1) being coupleable to one another and/or to a guiding vehicle (6) by means of the coupling device. The <b>transporting</b> units (1) can be removed or decoupled from the <b>transporting</b> system as closed units. For this purpose, the units have at least one handle (8) in addition to the couplings, said units being manually guidable by an operator (7) in the decoupled state by means of the handle such that the mail items to be <b>transported</b> can remain on the <b>transporting</b> unit until delivery without manually transferring or <b>transporting.</b> In particular, the delivery of parcels in the city-center area is implemented in a more efficient manner and thus in a more inexpensive and environmentally-friendly manner using the proposed <b>transporting</b> system...|$|R

In 2004 they still provided some 80% of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world, and some 20% of the world's <b>transport,</b> again mainly in rural areas.

Three coommunication <b>transports</b> are considered: (1) diffusive trans-ports where molecules diffuse via random thermal motion, (2) directional <b>transports</b> where molecules directionally move on pre-defined protein filaments with molecular motors and (3) diffusive-directional hybrid <b>transports</b> where molecules propagate with both diffusive and directional <b>transports.</b> Simulation results demonstrate that SW-ARQ improves latency and reliability in both diffusive and directional <b>transports.</b> Hybridization {{of the two}} <b>transports</b> aids extra improvements in latency and reliability.
