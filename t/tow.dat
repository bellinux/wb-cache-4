5|$|A wooden {{bridge was}} {{built over the}} Kennet at Newbury in 1726, {{replaced}} in stone between 1769 and 1772 by James Clarke, and {{now known as the}} Town Bridge or Water Bridge. As there is no <b>tow</b> path, a line to haul the barge had to be floated under the bridge and then re-attached to the horse where the <b>tow</b> path resumed.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{they were}} ready, the charges were blown and Nuneaton started to <b>tow</b> Likomba out of the harbour. Aboard Duchessa d'Aosta, 11 men had managed to get aboard from Vulcan; while one group planted charges on the anchor chains, another searched below decks {{collecting}} prisoners. Blowing the anchor chains, Vulcan started to <b>tow</b> Duchessa d'Aosta out of the harbour. The explosions had alerted the population of the town, who started to gather on the pier, but no attempts were made to stop the ships from leaving. Several anti-aircraft emplacements opened fire at imaginary targets, believing the explosions to have been caused by an aerial attack, but the six-inch guns protecting the harbour itself remained silent. From entering the harbour to leaving with the ships under <b>tow,</b> the operation had taken 30 minutes, without any losses to the raiding party.|$|E
5|$|Lipsett {{decided to}} <b>tow</b> New Mexico for {{scrapping}} at Newark, New Jersey. The proximity of Newark to rail lines {{made it an}} ideal location for dismantling the ship and hauling away the steel. In early November 1947 New Mexico departed Boston, towed by two tugs. On 12 November, while {{off the coast of}} New York, the tugs pulling the battleship encountered heavy weather and were forced to cut the <b>tow</b> lines. Running lights were kept on aboard New Mexico along with three crewmembers, but the tugs eventually lost sight of the battleship. New Mexico then drifted as a derelict until spotted by a Coast Guard plane the next day, 35 miles off the coast. The two tugs then secured <b>tow</b> lines and continued the journey to the scrapyard.|$|E
50|$|Braked <b>towing</b> {{capacity}} is the <b>towing</b> {{capacity of a}} vehicle if the trailer being <b>towed</b> has its own braking system, typically connected to the vehicle's braking system via the trailer cable. Braked <b>towing</b> {{capacity is}} typically significantly greater than unbraked <b>towing</b> capacity.|$|R
5000|$|The Accident <b>Towing</b> Services Act was {{the first}} {{dedicated}} statute regulating Victoria's <b>towing</b> industry and replaced provisions in the former Transport Act 1983. [...] The Act generally strengthened the scheme of regulation for accident <b>towing</b> activity in Victoria and, at the same time, deregulated trade <b>towing</b> industry controls. In essence, <b>towing</b> vehicles damaged in a road accident and the individuals working in that sector are subject to tight controls while trade <b>towing</b> activities such as breakdown <b>towing</b> have few controls.|$|R

5|$|On August 20, 1985, Israel sent 96 American-made <b>TOW</b> {{missiles}} to Iran through an arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar. Subsequently, on September 14, 1985, 408 more <b>TOW</b> missiles were delivered. On September 15, 1985, following the second delivery, Reverend Benjamin Weir {{was released by}} his captors, the Islamic Jihad Organization.|$|E

5|$|The initial attack hit {{the forward}} {{operating}} base's mortar pit, knocking out the 120mm mortar and detonating the stockpile of mortar ammunition. The insurgents next destroyed the Humvee-mounted <b>TOW</b> missile launcher inside the combat outpost with coordinated fire from unguided RPG rockets. The mortars and <b>TOW</b> launcher which were {{to provide the}} heaviest and most accurate firepower had been quickly taken out by the attackers. The explosion of the mortar shells hurled the anti-tank missiles into the command post.|$|E

For the sake of simplicity, letting a locus of a <b>towing</b> vessel and a locus of a net be concentric, mechanical equations were obtained. A chart which is drawn by numerical calculation of equations was also obtained. A series of experiments were carried out in order to verify these equations, and a simple estimation of the {{horizontal position}} of the net in relation to the <b>towing</b> vessel in a circular <b>towing</b> is possible with these relationships when the angle made by the <b>towing</b> warp and center line of the <b>towing</b> vessel is below 25 °...|$|R
50|$|According to Illinois Commerce Commission Police Commander Craig Baner, Lincoln <b>Towing</b> Service had 2078 {{complaints}} from 2000-2005. However, with {{the volume of}} business the <b>towing</b> service conducts, the complaint rates are comparable with other <b>towing</b> companies in Illinois. During the same period, Lincoln <b>Towing</b> issued 139 full refunds, a percentage which Baner says the <b>towing</b> service compares with other companies.|$|R
5|$|As dawn {{broke and}} {{visibility}} cleared, the sailors on Ceylon, Vénus and Victor realised {{that they were}} within sight of Saint Denis on Île Bourbon, and thus vulnerable to counterattack from Rowley's flagship Boadicea. Despite hasty repairs, neither Ceylon nor Vénus were seaworthy by 07:30, when British lookouts on the island spotted the three ships and sent word to Rowley. Within ten minutes, Rowley was at sea, taking 50 volunteers from Africaine to augment his crew. Hamelin made desperate efforts to limp back to Île de France, ordering Victor to <b>tow</b> Ceylon, but progress was slow and strong winds, which did not help the dismasted Ceylon and Vénus, repeatedly broke the <b>tow</b> rope.|$|E
5|$|By nightfall {{some of the}} {{remaining}} French ships had entered Donegal Bay with Canada, Melampus and Foudroyant still in pursuit. The two forces repeatedly passed {{one another in the}} dark, and Canada almost drove ashore. Back at the battle site, Warren had ordered Robust to <b>tow</b> Hoche into Lough Swilly—this order later came under criticism, as Robust was in a battered state herself and the storms of the previous week had not abated. When a gale struck the pair on 13 October, Hoche lost several masts and broke her <b>tow,</b> only being prevented from foundering by the combined efforts of the British prize crew and their French prisoners. Eventually, on 15 October, Doris appeared and took Hoche in <b>tow,</b> arriving in Lough Swilly without further incident a few days later. Meanwhile, Ethalion saw Bellone safely into port, and Magnanime and Amelia brought in Coquille and Embuscade respectively.|$|E
5|$|For other {{problems}} {{so long as}} power is available for the braking and steering system, the vehicle can be conventionally towed subject to instructions in the owner's manual. Using the car to <b>tow</b> trailers is not recommended.|$|E

50|$|The <b>towing</b> {{industry}} {{is known to}} have substantial potential for abuse, as <b>towing</b> most often occurs in difficult situations, without many options for the consumer to turn to. In addition, in certain situations, <b>towing</b> operators may initiate a <b>towing</b> procedure that is unwarranted, and the consumer may be forced to make a payment to the operator before the vehicle is released. Various consumer citizen protection laws have been enacted by many jurisdictions to protect the consumer for predatory <b>towing</b> or predatory <b>towing</b> charges.|$|R

40|$|The magnitude, the direction, and the {{fluctuation}} of <b>towing</b> forces exerted upon gliders by <b>towing</b> them aloft {{behind an}} automobile, {{by means of a}} winch, and by airplane were measured under a variety of conditions covering a range from gentle to severe types of operation. For these tests the <b>towing</b> forces did not exceed 92 percent of the gross weight of the glider. The results indicate that in pulley and winch <b>towing</b> the <b>towing</b> forces are of about the same magnitude as in automobile <b>towing.</b> Speed increases in the accelerated phases of the <b>towing</b> jerks encountered in airplane <b>towing</b> can readily become critical as speeds in excess of placard speeds can be attained. Passage through the slipstream of the <b>towing</b> airplane can be equivalent to a severe gust that, at high speed, may impose high wing loads and require large control moments...|$|R

5|$|MV New Carissa was a {{freighter}} {{that ran}} aground {{on a beach}} near Coos Bay, Oregon, United States, during a storm in February 1999 and subsequently broke apart. An attempt to <b>tow</b> the bow section of the ship out to sea failed when the <b>tow</b> line broke, and the bow was grounded again. Eventually, the bow was successfully towed out to sea and sunk. The stern section remained on the beach near Coos Bay. Fuel on board the ship was burned off in situ with napalm, but a significant amount was also spilled from the wreckage, causing ecological damage to the coastline.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the shark}} attacks the other kids, hitting {{one of their}} boats, and causing most of them to capsize and crash into {{each other in the}} ensuing panic, {{throwing}} several of them, including Mike and Sean, into the water. The other teens help them out of the water while two of them pull Mike out as the shark goes for him and head back to get help. Sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats. A Coast Guard marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to <b>tow</b> them to shore. Before the pilot can <b>tow</b> them, the shark attacks and sinks the chopper with the pilot at the controls. It then knocks Sean into the water, but Marge sacrifices herself to save him.|$|E

5|$|Refusing to {{surrender}} until all options had been exhausted, Willoughby dispatched boats to Sirius, asking Pym if {{he believed it}} would be practical to send boats to <b>tow</b> Nereide out of range. Pym replied that with the boats engaged in attempting to <b>tow</b> Sirius and Magicienne off the reef {{it was not possible}} to deploy them under fire to <b>tow</b> Nereide. Pym also suggested that Willoughby disembark his men and set fire to his ship in the hope that the flames would spread to the French ships clustered on shore. Willoughby refused this suggestion as it was not practical to disembark the dozens of wounded men aboard Nereide in the growing darkness and refused to personally abandon his men when Pym ordered him to transfer to Sirius. At 11:00 pm, Willoughby ordered a boat to row to Bellone and notify the French commander that he had surrendered. However, Willoughby's boat had been holed by shot and was unable to make the short journey. The message was instead conveyed by French prisoners from Nereide who had dived overboard and reached the shore during the night. Recalling the false flags used on 20 August, Bouvet resolved to wait until morning before accepting the surrender.|$|E
5|$|The club {{made their}} first {{and so far}} only visit to Wembley Stadium on 9 May 1998, by winning through to {{the final of the}} FA Vase, under the {{management}} of Peter Quigley and his assistant Tony Heslop.

In reaching the final, <b>Tow</b> Law, with its population of only 2,200, became the smallest town to ever reach a Wembley final. The team took around 4,000 supporters with them down to London, about twice the population of <b>Tow</b> Law at the time. They were beaten in the final 1–0 by Tiverton Town.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{football}} team operating in <b>Tow</b> Law as early as 1881, when a vicar captained the team. However, the club still playing today was founded as <b>Tow</b> Law in 1890. The club {{became one of the}} founding teams of the Auckland and District League in 1892, and won the Durham Amateur Cup the following year. They then joined the Northern League in 1894. In 1896 they won the Durham Challenge Cup. They left the Northern League, and played in the South Durham Alliance from 1900 to 1905. In 1905 the club changed its name to <b>Tow</b> Law Town which they have stuck with ever since. The club played in the Crook and District League from 1912 until 1914. After the end of World War I in 1918, the club again played in the Auckland and District League until 1920, when they returned to the Northern League where they have played ever since. The club were league winners two seasons in a row, in 1923–24 and 1924–25. They were runners up in 1928–29. In the Second World War they resigned from the Northern League on 20 March 1940 and their record of the season was deleted. They rejoined the league in 1945 on its resumption after the War.|$|E
