5|$|The {{value of}} Marquis' work was {{properly}} recognized only after his death. Liberty and {{others believe that}} it <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> publish much of his work because of his controversial theory on the suicide of Custer's men. Historian Brian Dippie suggests that the Great Depression {{may also have been}} a contributing factor.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} year, Amazing {{contained}} primarily reprinted material. It was proving difficult to attract new, high-quality material, and Gernsback's slowness at paying his authors did not help. Writers such as H.P. Lovecraft, H.G. Wells, and Murray Leinster all avoided Amazing because Gernsback <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> {{pay for the}} stories he printed. The slow payments were probably known {{to many of the}} other active pulp writers, which would have further limited the volume of submissions. New writers did appear, but the quality of their stories was often weak.|$|E

5|$|The last of {{the bronze}} reliefs on the column's {{pedestals}} was not completed until May 1854, and the four lions, although {{part of the original}} design, were only added in 1867. Each lion weighs seven tons. A hoarding remained around the base of Nelson's Column for some years and some of its upper scaffolding remained in place. Landseer, the sculptor, had asked for a lion that had died at the London Zoo to be brought to his studio. He <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> complete sketches that its corpse began to decompose and some parts had to be improvised. The statues have paws that resemble cats more than lions.|$|E
5|$|The Lavochkin La-150 (also {{known as}} the Izdeliye 150 – Aircraft or Article 150, USAF/DOD {{designation}} Type 3), was designed by the Lavochkin design bureau (OKB) {{in response to a}} 1945 order to build a single-seat jet fighter using a single German turbojet. By this time both the Americans and British, as well as the Germans, had already flown jet fighters and the single Soviet jet engine under development (the Lyulka TR-1) was not yet ready for production. The design was completed quickly, but the construction of the five flying prototypes was protracted by the factory's inexperience in building metal aircraft. The aircraft made its first flight in September 1946, but proved to require extensive modifications to meet the Soviet Air Forces' requirements. These <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> make and test that the aircraft was essentially obsolete by the time that they were completed. Even one variant with a much more powerful engine was inferior to other aircraft that the OKB had under development and all work was terminated in 1947.|$|E

25|$|The first {{cases of}} 1p36 {{deletion}} syndrome were {{described in the}} 1980s. However, since many of these individuals also had other chromosomal imbalances, symptoms varied widely. The reason it <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> recognize the condition as a distinct chromosome deletion syndrome is that the deletions causing the disorder {{are too small to}} be detected in a routine chromosomal analysis. FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) and DNA-based technology known as MLPA (multiple ligation probe amplification) used in testing have aided in diagnosing an increasing number of cases since the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Some Irish legends {{involve the}} Oilliphéist, the Caoránach, and the Copóg Phádraig. During his evangelising journey back to Ireland from his parent's home at (perhaps) Birdoswald, he is {{understood}} to have carried with him an ash wood walking stick or staff. He thrust this stick into the ground wherever he was evangelising and at the place now known as Aspatria (ash of Patrick), {{the message of the}} dogma <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> get through to the people there that the stick had taken root {{by the time he was}} ready to move on.|$|E
25|$|In Galveston, Austin was {{at anchor}} while Commodore Moore met with President Houston and Secretary of War and Marine George Washington Hockley {{to make plans}} for the Texan fleet. Moore {{discovered}} that Houston would not release $20,000 in discretionary money recently appropriated by the Texas Congress for the navy, and thus the sailors and officers would not be paid {{for the second consecutive}} year; many sailors deserted. Despite Houston's lack of support for the navy, he did not hesitate to use it when it suited his needs. He ordered a blockade of Mexico in July 1842 and released just over $18,000 for the repair and provisioning of the ships. However, the repairs <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> complete that the blockade never materialized. Then, in September 1842, General Adrian Woll led a large force of Mexican regulars in an invasion of Texas, capturing San Antonio in what has become known as the Woll Invasion.|$|E

25|$|The delayed brigade {{counter-attack}} {{was ordered}} for dawn on 21 January, spearheaded by the 2LR but the 6RNR and 3/16PR were incapable of attacking so soon and the 2LR {{had only just}} arrived; the attack was postponed again but with orders to begin as soon as possible. At 20:00, Arthur Percival (General Officer Commanding Malaya Command) decided that the Japanese capture of the Pelandok defile seriously endangered the Westforce line of communications and ordered Bennett to continue to withdraw south of Labis to a line from Paloh to the Sungei Gerchang bridge {{on the road to}} Labis and to detach a brigade as soon as possible to dig in at the Yong Peng road junction. As the 27th Australian Brigade covered Yong Peng, Percival put all troops on the Muar–Yong Peng road back under the command of Westforce at 12:30. The counter-attack by the 53rd Brigade never occurred; at 10:30 on 21 January, Key visited the brigade and found that half of his orders had not been transmitted, that the brigade had not planned an attack and the 2LR had been sent to dig in at the east end of the causeway. An attack could be arranged for 14:00 but more confusion occurred and the start time was moved to 15:30. The Japanese positions gave a view of the ground east of the ridge, making surprise impossible to achieve and more time was needed to arrange artillery support and concentrate the 2LR. The attack was postponed again to 18:00 and then to the morning of 22 January. The artillery <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> register that ther was another postponement to 09:00 but the 2LR who had assembled under cover of night were spotted by Japanese reconnaissance aircraft and bombed and strafed. With no prospect of surprise and doubtful that the attack could succeed, Duke cancelled the operation and redeployed the three battalions to guard the causeway and the ground from there to the defile.|$|E
25|$|Australia now {{had three}} and a half days to set England an {{unreachable}} target and bowl them out. Ken Archer ran a four off Alec Bedser in the first over and Arthur Morris struck two boundaries off Doug Wright when he replaced John Warr in the sixth over. Archer called Morris for a run off Bedser, but they both hesitated in the middle and Morris was run out for 16 by a left-handed throw from David Sheppard. Lindsay Hassett was almost bowled first ball, but survived and Australia were 34/1 at stumps. Archer (32) and Hassett (31) returned in the morning to take the score along to 95/3, but it was Neil Harvey (68), Keith Miller (99) and debutant Jim Burke (101 not out) who put the match beyond doubt. Harvey and Miller ran the bowling ragged and added 99 for the fourth wicket until Harvey was bowled by Brown (1/14) and Miller chopped a ball from Wright onto his stumps. Doug Wright (2/109) and Roy Tattersall (1/116) were heavily punished and Bedser (0/62) was wicketless. Australia ended the fourth day 384 runs ahead and that evening Freddie Brown and Brigadier Green were hospitalised after a car crash returning from dinner with Sir Willoughby Norrie, the Governor of South Australia. A car had pulled out suddenly from a side street and Brown swerved into a post for holding electric tram lines. Brown left the hospital early in the morning, but was unfit to play and vice-captain Denis Compton became the first professional captain to lead England since Jack Hobbs when Arthur Carr was injured in 1924–25. He was unable to prevent Jim Burke from making a Test century on debut, the ninth Australian to do so (compared to 10 Englishmen at the time). John Warr took his first and only Test wicket when Ian Johnson cut the ball to Evans, who knocked it up on the first attempt then ran forward to catch it on the rebound. Umpire Cocks <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> make a decision that Johnson walked (almost unheard in Australia) to give the long-suffering Warr his first Test wicket and a bowling average of 281.00, the highest by an England bowler. The 12th man Sam Loxton was sent out by Hassett to tell Burke that he could take all the time he wanted over his hundred and the dour stock clerk reached his target after 245minutes at the crease. Hassett then declared at 403/8 to give England {{a day and a half}} to make 503 to win.|$|E

500|$|The studio {{version of}} the song was {{compiled}} from several different takes. It {{was one of several}} songs mixed by Steve Lillywhite in the final months of recording The Joshua Tree.

500|$|All eight capital {{ships of}} the 1909–1910 Naval Programme {{had the same}} {{arrangement}} of masts and funnels; only the two battlecruisers had their foremast and forward funnel positions exchanged at considerable expense. David K. Brown, naval architect and historian, commented on the whole fiasco: [...] "It is amazing that it <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> attain a satisfactory arrangement, which {{was caused by the}} DNO's insistence on sighting hoods in the roofs of turrets and Jellicoe's obsession with boat-handling arrangements. These unsatisfactory layouts reduced firepower, prejudiced torpedo protection and probably added to cost. As DNO and then as Controller, Jellicoe must accept much of the blame for the unsatisfactory layout of the earlier ships." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} Test, Bradman scored another century and England lost the match and series, {{although}} Wyatt played a substantial innings, and Wisden conceded Chapman {{could have made}} little difference except as a fielder. The two men remained friends {{during and after the}} controversy. In comparing circumstances of Chapman's appointment with those of his replacement by Wyatt, Gibson writes: [...] "In 1926, England won: in 1930, England lost. That is why the echoes <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> die down and why the selectors remained villains." [...] He concludes that, even though Wyatt did relatively well, [...] "It does seem, after all these years, an odd decision to have taken." [...] In the series, Chapman scored 259 runs at 43.16. In all first-class cricket, he passed four figures for the final time, reaching 1,027 runs at an average of 29.34.|$|E

500|$|Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that}} the series [...] "created a whole new sort of {{television}} show: One that must support, and change with, the plot twists of its film family ... never before has television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise." [...] She stated that the Captain America: The Winter Soldier crossover [...] "infused S.H.I.E.L.D. with a new energy, and helped explain, perhaps, why the show <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> find its footing—in the writers' room at least ... That Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to succeed as a story both independent and ancillary is all but miraculous." [...] She concluded that the series [...] "is now not only a very good show in its own right, it's part of Marvel's multiplatform city-state. It faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that {{puts it in the}} exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{few things}} {{retained}} from earlier ships was the position of the tripod foremast with its spotting top behind the forward funnel to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the boat-handling derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable at times, but the Board of Admiralty insisted on it for all the ships of the 1909–1910 Programme. David K. Brown, naval architect and historian, commented on the whole fiasco: [...] "It is amazing that it <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> attain a satisfactory arrangement, which was caused by the Director of Naval Ordnance (DNO)'s insistence on sighting hoods in the roofs of turrets and Jellicoe's obsession with boat-handling arrangements.

500|$|Small-scale {{military}} actions, {{which would}} eventually escalate into the Vietnam War, {{started in the}} late 1950s, when South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem instituted an anti-Communist campaign aimed at rooting out [...] "left behind" [...] Viet Minh forces. At that time, North Vietnam was hoping for an election, promised under the Geneva Accords of 1954, that would unite North and South Vietnam. It was also worried about inciting the United States into directly supporting South Vietnam, and had recommended a policy of avoiding battle at all costs. However, Diem's campaign was too successful {{to allow them to}} do nothing, and small-scale actions broke out across the country. North Vietnam remained worried about US involvement and refused any sort of military support, forcing the remaining Viet Minh to retreat into inaccessible areas in the hills and river estuaries. A stalemate of sorts followed, as South Vietnamese forces <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> reach these areas that the guerrilla fighters were able to retreat with little difficulty.|$|E

50|$|In {{an online}} {{interview}} with Tim Simenon in May 2008, it was remarked that Future Chaos would finally {{be released in}} August 2008.
