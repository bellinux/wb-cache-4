40|$|Abstract: The human {{respiratory}} mucosa becomes colonized by a {{wide array}} of bacterial species in early life. Residing microorganisms comprise commensal as well as potentially virulent bacterial species that have adapted to and co-evolved with their host. Because of the specific environmental conditions prevalent in the respiratory tract, colonizing organisms have developed functionally similar components that enable them to thrive on the mucosal surfaces and establish chains of person-to-person spread through droplet <b>transmission.</b> <b>Members</b> of the normal respiratory flora exhibit complex relations ranging from cooperation to mutual interference. This normal flora is maintained under strict control by the integrity of the respiratory epithelium and immunological phenomena, whereas residing bacteria show remarkable antigenic variability that guarantees survival of the species through a constant turnover of colonizing strains. The overall composition of carried organisms can be deeply affected by antibiotic exposure and use of conjugate vaccines. Although bacterial carriage is usually asymptomatic, contributory factors such as young age, primary or acquired immunodeficiencies, viral infections, and emergence of hypervirulent clones, may facilitate the development of mucosal or systemic disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Messages are {{transmitted}} from financial exchanges to update their members {{about changes in}} the market. As UDP packets are used for message <b>transmission,</b> <b>members</b> subscribe to two identical message feeds from the exchange to {{lower the risk of}} message loss or delay. As financial trades can be time sensitive, low latency arbitration between these market data feeds is of particular importance. Members must either provide generic arbitration for all of their financial applications, increasing latency, or arbitrate within each application which wastes resources and scales poorly. We present a reconfigurable accelerated approach for market feed arbitration operating at the network level. Multiple arbitrators can operate within a single FPGA to output customised feeds to downstream financial applications. Application-specific customisations are supported by each core, allowing different market feed messaging proto-cols, windowing operations and message buffering parameters. We model multiple-core arbitration and explore the scalability and performance improvements within and between cores. We demonstrate our design within a Xilinx Virtex- 6 FPGA using the NASDAQ TotalView-ITCH 4. 1 messaging standard. Our im-plementation operates at 16 Gbps throughput, and with resource sharing, supports 12 independent cores, 33 % more than simple core replication. A 56 ns (7 clock cycles) windowing latency is achieved, 2. 6 times lower than a hardware-accelerated CPU approach. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{percentages}} of couples in HIV sero-discordant relationships range from 5 to 31 % {{in the various}} countries of Africa. Given the importance of procreation {{and the lack of}} assisted reproduction to avoid partner <b>transmission,</b> <b>members</b> of these couples are faced with a serious dilemma even after the challenge of disclosing their HIV status to their spouses. Identifying the determinants of the decision to have children among sero-discordant couples will help in setting reproductive intervention priorities in resource-poor countries. Methods We conducted a survey among 114 mutually disclosed sero-discordant couples (228 individuals) receiving HIV care at four centres in Greater Kampala, between June and December 2007. The data we collected was classified according to whether the man or the woman was HIV-positive. We carried out multivariate logistic regression modelling to determine factors (age, gender, and the influences of relatives and of health workers, ART knowledge, and disclosure) that are independently associated with a desire for children. Results The majority, 59 %, of the participants, desired to have children. The belief that their partner wanted children was a major determinant of the desire to have children, irrespective of the HIV sero-status (adjusted odds ratio 24. 0 (95 % CI 9. 15, 105. 4)). Among couples in which the woman was HIV-positive, young age and relatives' expectations for children were significantly associated with increased fertility desire, while among couples in which the man was positive; knowledge of ART effectiveness was associated with increased fertility desire. Availability of information on contraception was associated with decreased fertility desire. Conclusions The gender of the positive partner affects the factors associated with a desire for children. Interventions targeting sero-discordant couples should explore contraceptive choices, the cultural importance of children, and partner communication. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{invention}} comprises a {{torque drive}} mechanism utilizing axially translatable, mutually engageable <b>transmission</b> <b>members</b> having mating crown gears, driven and driving members with a three-element drive train being biased together by resilient means or by a fluid actuator system, the apparatus being operable to transmit a precisely controlled degree of torque to a driven member. The apparatus is applicable {{for use in}} hand tools and {{as a replacement for}} impact torque drivers, torque wrenches, motorized screw drivers, or the like, wherein the applied torque must be precisely controlled or limited. The bevel torque drive includes a drive gear which is axially displaceable and rotatable within cylindrical driver housing, a rotatable intermediate gear, and an output gear. Key rotationally secures displaceable gear with respect to input shaft but permits axial movement therebetween. A thrust bearing is preferably connected to the lower end of shaft for support to reduce play and friction between shaft and a transmission joint disc during rotation of the gear train. Coaxially mounted coiled spring is footed against displaceable gear for biasing the displaceable gear toward and into engagement with the intermediate gear for driving intermediate gear and output gear. Torque control is achieved by the use of straight or spiral beveled gears which are of configurations adapted to withdraw from mutual engagement upon the torque exceeding a predetermined limit. The novel, advantageous features of the invention include the configuration of the mating, crown gear sets and the axially translatable, slidable drive gear. The mechanism is capable of transmitting a high degree of torque within a narrow, compact transmission housing. The compact size and narrow, elongated configuration of the housing is particularly applicable for use in hand tools and in multiple torque driver mechanisms in which it is necessary to drive multiple fasteners which are located in close proximity. Prior torque drivers such as 'click-type' torque wrenches do not actually limit torque application but only provide an audible warning that the limit has been reached...|$|R
