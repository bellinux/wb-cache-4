5|$|Research in {{the field}} of {{addiction}} medicine has also recently turned its focus to LTP, owing to the hypothesis that drug addiction represents a powerful form of learning and memory. Addiction is a complex neurobehavioral phenomenon involving various parts of the brain, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Studies have demonstrated that VTA and NAc synapses are capable of undergoing LTP and that this LTP may be responsible for <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> that characterize addiction.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{equations}} {{of motion}} can be linearized, a bike is a nonlinear system. The variable(s) to be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum of <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> of its descriptors. Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which friction and any flexing is ignored, a bike is a conservative system. Damping, however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy added with a sideways jolt to a bike running straight and upright (demonstrating self-stability) is converted into increased forward speed, not lost, as the oscillations die out.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are social}} insects; {{a large number}} of species are either gregarious or {{inclined}} to aggregate, and a slightly smaller number exhibit parental care. It used to be thought that cockroaches aggregated because they were reacting to environmental cues, but it is now believed that pheromones are involved in these behaviors. Some species secrete these in their feces with gut microbial symbionts being involved, while others use glands located on their mandibles. Pheromones produced by the cuticle may enable cockroaches to distinguish between different populations of cockroach by odor. <b>The</b> <b>behaviors</b> involved have only been studied in a few species, but German cockroaches leave fecal trails with an odor gradient. Other cockroaches follow such trails to discover sources of food and water, and where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, cockroaches have emergent behavior, in which group or swarm behavior emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.|$|E
50|$|Using a {{comparative}} approach to behavior {{allows one to}} evaluate <b>the</b> target <b>behavior</b> from four different, complementary perspectives, developed by Niko Tinbergen. First, one may ask how pervasive <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> is across species (i.e. how common is <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> between animal species?). Second, one may ask how <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> contributes to <b>the</b> lifetime reproductive success of the individuals demonstrating <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> (i.e. does <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> result in animals producing more offspring than animals not displaying <b>the</b> <b>behavior)?</b> Theories addressing <b>the</b> ultimate causes of behavior {{are based on the}} answers to these two questions.|$|R

5|$|In 1924, Einstein {{received}} {{a description of}} a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms {{as well as to the}} proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> of any assembly of bosons. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.|$|E

50|$|Unlike the {{indirect}} methods of FBAs, descriptive functional behavior assessment employs direct observation of behavior.

But the proposed judging algorithm of behavior relativity was feasible only in the case that T-invariant of Petri net model exists, and <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> conformance was also difficult to handle. In the paper, firstly, in order to analyze <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> relativity between <b>the</b> Web services, an algorithm for determining <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> weak soundness of the composite service was presented based on the theory of the service tree. Then, we present an effective analysis method of behavior conformance based on process mining. Finally, we develop plug-ins and test our methods in large benchmarks, and compare our methods with genetic process mining methods. The theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that this method can realize <b>the</b> predictable <b>behavior</b> of software well, and satisfy <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> trustworthiness requirements of software...|$|R

Additional factors that complicate the measurement of job performance include the instability of job performance over time due to forces such as changing performance criteria, the structure of the job itself and the restriction of variation in individual performance by organizational forces. These factors include errors in job measurement techniques, acceptance and the justification of poor performance and lack of importance of individual performance.|$|E
