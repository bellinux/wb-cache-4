40|$|The interdecadal {{variation}} of Pacific thermocline represented by depth anomalies of 25 sigma(theta) isopycnal surface calculated from SODA data set is analyzed. The climatological depth of 25 sigma(theta) gisopycnal surface is {{quite close to}} the depth of 20 degreesC isotherm in the tropical Pacific. The EOF 1 mode of the 25 sigma(theta) isopycnal surface accounts for 26. 4 % {{of the total variance}} and its associated pattern is of east-west direction. The centers of positive and negative extremes are located near 10 degreesS over the southern Pacific and the correlation coefficient with zero-lag between the corresponding EOF 1 <b>time</b> <b>coefficient</b> and PDO index is - 0. 67. This shows that there is very close relation between the southern tropical Pacific and PDO. The wavelet analysis of detrended EOF 1 <b>time</b> <b>coefficient</b> reveals that there are two dominant time scales of about 3 similar to 7 and 30 a respectively. An apparent abruptness of mean value occurred in the late 1970 s. EOF 2 mode accounts for 12. 4 % of the total variance and its pattern is an ENSO-related one. The correlation coefficient between the EOF 2 <b>time</b> <b>coefficient</b> and NINO 3 index is - 0. 68. The wavelet analysis of EOF 2 <b>time</b> <b>coefficient</b> reveals that there are two leading time scales of about 2 similar to 7 and 10 similar to 15 a respectively. On an interdecadal scale, the zonal change is consistent along the equator and is seesaw along 10 degreesS; there is consistent polarity in the tropics along 165 degreesE, but reverse polarity between around equator and other tropical region along 120 degreesW. In all the four profiles mentioned above, the regime shift occurred in the late 1970 s.

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to examine the {{relationship}} between performance in the 400 -meter walking test and mortality. Data are from a population-based sample of 948 Italian men and women[*]≥ 65 years. The main outcome measures that were assessed comprised time to complete the 400 -meter walk, 20 -meter lap <b>time</b> <b>coefficient</b> of variation, need to rest during the test, and ability to complete the walk. All-cause mortality was ascertained over a 6 -year follow-up period. Data were analyzed with proportional hazard logistic and linear regression analyses. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, all 400 -meter walking test variables except need to rest were associated with mortality. After further adjusting for the Mini-Mental State Examination, symptoms of depression, education, smoking, body mass index, being sedentary/minimally active, disease burden, and lower extremity performance (Short Physical Performance Battery score), both time to complete the 400 -meter walk and lap <b>time</b> <b>coefficient</b> of variation were significant independent predictors of mortality.

Then, cross-training policies that pool a set of departments into a single larger department that serves all of the pooled call types according to either a first-come-first-served or non-pre-emptive priority service discipline are examined. The impact of system parameters, such {{as the number of}} servers, mean service times and service <b>time</b> <b>coefficient</b> of variation, on the decision of which departments to pool in order to minimize the expected delay in the system are characterized by comparing the proposed queueing models via standard queueing approximations and numerical analysis.

One of the important aims of the present line of work was in removing or avoiding the divergence difficulty in calculating the electrophoretic and relaxation <b>time</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The present work achieves that aim by calculating {{on the basis of}} computing the axial velocity profiles the position of the center of the ion atmosphere {{as a function of the}} reduced field strength and therewith computing the electrophoretic and relaxation <b>time</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the migrating spherical ion atmosphere at each value of the reduced field strength.

It is also compared with the prediction by Wilson's theory and is found very much improved over the latter. Moreover, the present method is divergence-free unlike Wilson's theory. It therefore not only sheds a new light on the nonequilibrium liquid structure of ionic solutions and the motion of ion atmosphere in an electric field, but also shows how the Onsager [...] Wilson theory of conductance in electrolyte solutions should be applied to account for the Wien effect on ionic conductance.

Here, a new method is provided for the measurement of reduced and total forms of thiols in red blood cells. In order to minimize oxidation of reduced thiols, a water erythrocyte lysis (15 min at 4 ° C) was performed followed by a protein precipitation step with acetonitrile. The supernatant was rapidly derivatized with 5 -iodoacetoamidefluorescein that trapped thiol groups, thus minimizing auto-oxidation. Derivatized samples were separated in a 57 cm x 75 µ m ID capillary by using 5 mmol/L sodium phosphate, 4 mmol/L boric acid as electrolyte solution with 75 mmol/L N -methyl- D -glucamine at pH 11. 0.
