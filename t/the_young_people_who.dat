For the record, it's my least favorite quality and it doesn't lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what {{they thought they were}} going to get. But if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen. I'm telling you, amazing things will happen.|$|E
25|$|The Ashram {{was founded}} by Ralph Templin and Jay Holmes Smith in 1940. It was a religious, pacifist group based on the Gandhian {{philosophy}} of non-violence. In the interest of promoting interracial good will, {{the members of the}} Ashram associated themselves with the members of a predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood in the city. Reynolds and her associates organized games and activities for <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> lived in East Harlem, also known as Spanish Harlem.|$|E
500|$|The cover art by Hugh Syme {{features}} {{an elderly woman}} hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline. According to bassist David Ellefson, the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track, [...] "We've been hung out to dry". He explained that the title track [...] "was probably the strongest representation of how we feel about <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> listen to our music and what their future holds for them. It's {{like you have a}} choice, you can become proactive or you can choose 'Youthanasia'." [...] The title is a combination [...] of the words [...] "youth" [...] and [...] "euthanasia". Mustaine has stated that the idea for the title stems from hearing about Jack Kevorkian, as well as the declining state of well-being of young people, specifically referring to issues like drugs, crime and violence, and a lack of parenting.|$|E
25|$|The end of Salazar's rule in 1968, due to illness, did not prompt {{any change}} in the {{political}} panorama. The radicalization of the opposition movements started with <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> also felt victimized by the continuation of the war.|$|R

50|$|Carmen Parrilla {{assumes that}} San Pedro was {{a grown man}} {{by the end of}} the 15th century, when he wrote Desprecio de la Fortuna, because he apologized for the {{mistakes}} of his youth in this work. Parrilla has found that San Pedro was writing in the 1480s and 1490s for the queen’s entourage. He probably died and went unnoticed by <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were unfamiliar with him.|$|R
2500|$|... “Remembrance” is {{an audio}} work {{dedicated}} to <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{lost their lives}} in the Sichuan earthquake. It expresses thoughts for the passing of innocent lives and indignation for the cover-ups on truths about sub-standard architecture, which led to the large number of schools that collapsed during the earthquake.|$|E
2500|$|The Permissive Label: A {{couple weeks}} after my {{indictment}} , I was accused by Reverend Norman Vincent Peale, a well-known clergyman and author {{who supported the}} Vietnam War, of corrupting an entire generation. In a sermon widely reported in the press, Reverend Peale blamed me for all the lack of patriotism, lack of responsibility, and lack of discipline of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> opposed the war. All these failings, he said, were due to my having told their parents to give them [...] "instant gratification" [...] as babies. I was showered with blame in dozens of editorials and columns from primarily conservative newspapers {{all over the country}} heartily agreeing with Peale's assertions.|$|E
2500|$|The ESR {{criticized the}} {{education}} system's focus on {{preparing students for}} {{the next level of}} academic study and on the completion of rigid qualifying examinations. Also criticized was the government's lack of concern for <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> dropped out before learning marketable skills, a situation that contributed to unemployment. The report stated that, by contrast, [...] "The recommended system would provide a self-contained program at each level that would be terminal for most students." [...] The report was not published until February 1974, which gave time for rumors to generate opposition among students, parents, and the teachers' union to the ESR recommendations. Most resented what they considered the removal of education from its elite position. Many teachers also feared salary reductions. Strikes and widespread disturbances ensued, and the education crisis became a contributing factor in the imperial regime's fall later that year.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, as {{the city}} {{steadily}} grew as a ski town, the Jerome declined. It was closed for several years. When John Gilmore bought it in 1968 and reduced it to 34 rooms, he rented them for a mere $5 ($ in modern dollars) a night. Many of <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were increasingly drawn to Aspen sneaked in to take showers on the third floor. He tried to interest investors in rehabilitating the building, but could not. He was able to add new entrances to the storefronts, however.|$|R
2500|$|For this event, about 2,000 people participate, {{many of them}} {{soldiers}} from the Battle of Puebla reenactment. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> play the couple are chosen each year. This action takes place {{in front of the}} municipal palace, which stands in as the corregidor’s home. One of the generals plays the role of the corregidor. The daughter receives three messages from the bandit. The bandit enters the scene to music, fireworks and musket fire. The daughter is waits for him on the balcony, already dressed in white. The bandit then climbs up to the balcony, subdues the soldiers guarding her and takes her down to his horse. Just before doing so, however, he tosses large amounts of play money to the crowds yelling “Viva la plata” (Long live money (lit. silver)). The couple escapes on his horse as one group of soldiers pursue {{and the rest of the}} soldiers fire at the pursuers. [...] At three pm, a priest marries Lorenzo and the daughter. However, the story does not have a happy ending. At four pm is the “quema del jacal” (burning of the shack). This is the burning of a small shack made of palm fronds at one end of the plaza. It represents the house of the bandit with the couple inside. The legend has been interpreted as the hopes for equality among Mexico’s social classes after its Independence as the daughter is of the elite and the bandit is poor. The shack is also interpreted as the various wars of Mexico from the “flower wars” of the Mesoamerican era up through much of the 19th century.|$|E

50|$|The first {{indications}} that chickenpox and shingles {{were caused by}} the same virus were noticed {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century. Physicians began to report that cases of shingles were often followed by chickenpox in <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> lived with <b>the</b> person with shingles. The idea of an association between the two diseases gained strength when it was shown that lymph from a person with shingles could induce chickenpox in young volunteers. This was finally proved by the first isolation of the virus in cell cultures, by the Nobel laureate Thomas Huckle Weller, in 1953.|$|R

Piles of sandwiches disappeared during the afternoon, and the tea, coffee, and lemonade were pronounced excellent.

60|$|They had the {{privilege}} of making him restless, and on this occasion he walked away, suddenly, with his hands in his pockets, and then came back and leaned against his column.

It is to be supposed that by this time his perception of the mutual relations of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> surrounded him had become more acute; but he still took the matter very seriously, and he was not at all exhilarated.|$|E

They went quite mad with delight: enemies kissed in the streets; and all the parents, without exception, allowed all <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> happened to be in love to be married that very day. Then Prigio brought back all the maidens, one after the other, and Dick last; and he fell at the Inca's feet, and requested leave to marry Jaqueline.|$|E
