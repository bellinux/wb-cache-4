5|$|After Baldwin sanctioned the marriage, Constance and Raynald {{married in}} early 1153. Raynald {{took charge of}} the {{administration}} of the principality. However, he was unpopular because his subjects regarded him as an upstart. His frequent attempts to raise funds brought him into conflict with Patriarch Aimery and Emperor ManuelI during the subsequent years. The emperor forced Raynald to pay homage <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring of 1159. Raynald was captured and imprisoned by Majd al-Din, governor of Aleppo, during a plundering raid in November 1160 or 1161.|$|E

In this debate sponsored by the Des Moines Register, Dodd commented that Education was the most important issue <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> campaign. He also made a statement on why he felt he was the best choice for president and why he should receive the endorsement of the Des Moines Register, which ultimately went to Hillary Clinton.|$|E
5|$|Following a footballing career spent {{exclusively}} with Torpedo, Streltsov, {{a supporter of}} Spartak Moscow, repeatedly complained about his failure to play for his favourite team. After his retirement, Torpedo continued to pay his salary to fund his study of football coaching at the Institute of Physical Culture. Streltsov returned to Torpedo in the capacity of youth team manager following his qualification; he also spent a brief spell as manager of the first team {{before returning to the}} youth team in 1982. He also took part in matches contested by former players before dying in 1990 from throat cancer, which his first wife Alla later claimed had been brought about by irradiated food served <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> camps. Seven years later, Marina Lebedeva, the woman Streltsov had confessed to raping, was seen laying flowers at his grave in Moscow on the day after the anniversary of his death.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, Mugabe {{received}} an honorary knighthood from the British state; this was stripped from {{him at the}} advice of the UK government in 2008. Mugabe holds several honorary degrees and doctorates from international universities, awarded <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s; at least three of these have since been revoked. In June 2007, he became the first international figure ever to be stripped of an honorary degree by a British university, when the University of Edinburgh withdrew the degree awarded to him in 1984. On 12 June 2008, the University of Massachusetts Amherst Board of Trustees voted to revoke the law degree awarded to Mugabe in 1986; {{this is the first time}} one of its honorary degrees has been revoked.|$|E
5|$|Later {{claiming}} {{that she was}} acting under instruction from the Ascended Masters, Fortune and Loveday joined the Christian Mystic Lodge of the Theosophical Society, which was run by Daisy M. Grove. Fortune soon became its president, and under her leadership the group's membership expanded and the readership of its published Transactions also grew. Throughout this period, she foregrounded {{the need for a}} Christian perspective within the Theosophical movement, emphasising the centrality and importance of the 'Master Jesus' in her various articles. She publicly criticised another Theosophical group, the Liberal Catholic Church founded by J. I. Wedgwood and Charles Webster Leadbeater, alleging that it was not concerned with the Master Jesus and was instead preoccupied with the Master Maitreya. One of the prominent figures in the Church, Bishop Piggott, accused her of attributing false claims <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Occult Review.|$|E
5|$|Lichton's death {{cannot be}} {{precisely}} dated. It fell between 11 November (Martinmas) 1440, and 11 January 1441; {{it is probable}} that he died on either 12 or 14 December, because these were the anniversaries given <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 15th century and the 16th century respectively. He was buried in his new chapel, the one dedicated to St John the Evangelist. As a churchman, Lichton could never marry and did not; he did however father a bastard, a daughter named Janet, who appeared in the records receiving papal dispensation to marry in 1432.|$|E

He felt that during this period of time, from 1939 to 1941, he was able to make his greatest contribution to an institution that had been very good <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past.|$|E
5|$|SpongeBob {{receives}} a paddle ball sent <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mail {{and decides to}} play it. He is totally consumed by the challenge and forgets Gary for ten days. Gary feels neglected and runs away from home. SpongeBob is shaken from his infatuation {{with the arrival of}} Patrick, and cannot find Gary. SpongeBob finds a note saying that Gary has left in search of a new owner. Meanwhile, Gary has wandered into a new city, encountering a gang of snails. A kind old lady discovers Gary and mistakes him for one of her pets, Miss Tuftsy. Gary is showered with love and food while SpongeBob goes to work, sad that Gary is still missing. Mr. Krabs encourages SpongeBob to work, but SpongeBob misinterprets him, and he takes the day off to look for Gary. He and Patrick put up posters and signs everywhere in the hope of finding Gary.|$|E
5|$|The first {{organized}} form of Taoism, the Tianshi (Celestial Masters') school (later {{known as}} Zhengyi school), {{developed from the}} Five Pecks of Rice movement {{at the end of}} the 2nd century CE; the latter had been founded by Zhang Daoling, who claimed that Laozi appeared <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year 142. The Tianshi school was officially recognized by ruler Cao Cao in 215, legitimizing Cao Cao's rise to power in return. Laozi received imperial recognition as a divinity in the mid-2nd century BCE.|$|E

5|$|When {{a chance}} arose {{for him to}} escape to a safe country, Edwin chose to remain at Rædwald's court. He was then visited by a {{stranger}} who was aware of Rædwald's deliberations. The source for this story, written at Whitby, stated that the stranger was Paulinus of York, {{a member of the}} Canterbury mission, who offered Edwin the hope of Rædwald's support and held out the prospect that Edwin might someday attain greater royal power than any previous English king. Paulinus was assured by Edwin that he would accept his religious teaching. His vision of Paulinus was afterwards made the means of his decision to embrace Christianity, on the condition that he survived and achieved power. If, as is supposed by some, Paulinus appeared <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flesh, the bishop's presence at Rædwald's court would throw some light on the king's position regarding religion.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of both Yeesha and Esher, the player travels across four Ages, {{collecting}} four slates that unlock the tablet's power. Esher occasionally appears in the Ages to offer his counsel, or reveal the histories of his people and the worlds the player explores. Once all four slates are collected, Esher requests that the player bring the tablet <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> now-unlocked Age of Myst. The player is then returned to K'veer, where they have four possible choices. Travelling to Myst without the tablet will cause Esher to angrily abandon the player with no way out. If Esher is given the tablet, he will explain he wishes to use the tablet for domination, and will also leave the player trapped. If the player gives the tablet to Yeesha, the tablet simply slips through her hands and disappears into the ground; she walks away, disappointed, leaving the player trapped in D'ni. The only good ending involves giving the Bahro the tablet, ending their enslavement. Arriving at Releeshahn, the new home Age of the D'ni, Yeesha and Atrus thank the player and speak of a new chapter for the D'ni people; Esher is {{handed over to the}} Bahro to be punished for his crimes. The game ends on a visit to Releeshahn.|$|E
5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him, and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that seems to be coming from the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E
