5|$|After Byzantium, the Spartans were {{allegedly}} {{eager to}} end their involvement in the war. The Spartans were supposedly of the view that, with the liberation of mainland Greece and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that securing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible. In the aftermath of Mycale, the Spartan king Leotychides had proposed transplanting all the Greeks from Asia Minor to Europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from Persian dominion. Xanthippus, the Athenian commander at Mycale, had furiously rejected this; the Ionian cities were originally Athenian colonies, and the Athenians, if no-one else, would protect the Ionians. This marks {{the point at which}} <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek Alliance effectively passed to the Athenians. With the Spartan withdrawal after Byzantium, <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Athenians became explicit.|$|E
5|$|As a {{proxy for}} his father, Romulus made no {{decisions}} and left no monuments, though coins bearing his name were minted in Rome, Milan, Ravenna, and Gaul.

When Orestes refused, the tribes revolted under <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scirian chieftain Odoacer. Orestes was captured near Piacenza on 28 August 476 and swiftly executed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sixth}} century, exiled-Irishman Colum Cille (died 597) seated himself on Iona, {{from where he}} oversaw the {{foundation}} of numerous daughter-houses in the surrounding islands and mainland. Men of his own choosing, many from his own extended family, were appointed to administrate these dependent houses. In time, a lasting monastic network—an ecclesiastical familia—was centred on the island, and led by his successors. During the ongoing Viking onslaught in the ninth century, <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> familia relocated to Kells. In the twelfth century, Flaithbertach Ua Brolcháin, Abbot of Derry (died 1175), the comarba ("successor") of Colum Cille, relocated from Kells to Derry. In 1164, {{at a time when}} Somairle ruled the entire Kingdom of the Isles, the Annals of Ulster indicates that he attempted to reinstate the monastic familia on Iona under Flaithbertach's leadership. Unfortunately for Somairle, the proposal was met with significant opposition, and with his death in the same year, his intentions of controlling the kingdom, diocese, as well as <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> familia came to nothing.|$|E
