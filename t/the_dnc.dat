5|$|Fisher's {{desire for}} a shallow draught was not merely based {{on the need to}} allow for inshore operations; ships tended to operate closer to deep load than {{anticipated}} and were often found lacking in freeboard, reserve buoyancy and safety against underwater attack. This experience led <b>the</b> <b>DNC</b> to reconsider the proportions of the hull to rectify the problems identified thus far. The Courageous-class ships were the first products of that re-evaluation.|$|E

5|$|By mid 1945, the {{economic}} drain on Britain {{due to her}} sustained war effort was becoming critical, and a new proposal, with an armour arrangement similar to the modernized HMS Renown, christened 'Design X', was submitted by a design committee headed by Admiral Servaes to <b>the</b> <b>DNC.</b> 'Design X', along with the earlier preferred 'B3' variant Battleship design were further refined through October 1945, when further design work was informally suspended on all but the new Mk III 16 inch turret. This work too was finally cancelled by the First Sea Lord in late 1949 and brought a final end to battleship design and construction for the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|Sir Stanley V. Goodall, Director of Naval Construction (DNC), {{proposed}} {{a variety of}} designs, both open and closed hangar. On 8 October 1943, the Board of Admiralty selected a closed-hangar design with an armoured flight deck and five propeller shafts. Reports of American operations in the Pacific convinced the Board to reconsider hangar design; American experience had shown {{that the ability to}} fly off all of a carrier's aircraft in a single airstrike was vital. That required a well-ventilated, open-hangar design, which would reduce the time required to launch the aircraft by allowing them to begin the typical 15-minute engine warm-up while still in the hangar. On 15 May 1944, the Board reversed itself and ordered <b>the</b> <b>DNC</b> to produce an open-hangar design with deck-edge lifts. An unarmoured flight deck was agreed upon in June by the Controller of the Navy and the Fifth Sea Lord.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>DNC</b> {{objected to}} the loss of the {{mainmast}} as he believed that it was needed to support a boat-handling derrick, but was overruled by the Admiralty, which preferred to position the tripod foremast behind the forward funnel with the tripod legs facing forward to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable. The short height of the funnel also bedevilled the bridge with smoke until it was raised in 1912, although this exacerbated the problem for the spotting top. The decision to space the wing turrets more closely together also made the smoke problem worse; because it reduced the space available to the aft boiler room which meant that the forward funnel had to accommodate the exhausts of a dozen boilers compared to the aft funnel's six, further increasing the smoke from the forward funnel.|$|E

25|$|A {{meeting with}} <b>the</b> <b>DNC</b> was convened {{to discuss the}} results. The Fleming craft had few friends in <b>the</b> <b>DNC,</b> though their criticisms were not specific.

Two of the firms were unable to tender, the third, Messrs Thornycroft, had a proposal on the drawing board in forty-eight hours and ISTDC and <b>the</b> <b>DNC</b> agreed that construction of a prototype should be paid for.

40|$|In the ever-growing {{demand for}} drug nanocomplexes (<b>DNCs),</b> <b>the</b> need for smart systems or {{processes}} is indispensable {{to circumvent the}} demerits imposed by the conventional methods for <b>the</b> synthesis of <b>DNCs.</b> <b>The</b> demerits include prolonged hours of the synthesis, minimal loading and poor conjugation. Herein, we proposed a simplistic approach for <b>the</b> synthesis of <b>DNCs</b> through a magnetically active Polydimethylsiloxane micromixer which can render maximal loading in an unprecedented time. The UV-Vis, FTIR, and XRD analysis corroborate the proposed mechanism of conjugation of the drug and nanoparticles. The XPS, contact angle and zeta potential measurements revealed the composition, hydrophilicity and surface charges of <b>the</b> synthesized <b>DNCs,</b> respectively. Further, <b>the</b> microscopy images exemplify the encapsulation of the drug. In the antibacterial activity studies, <b>the</b> <b>DNCs</b> substantially inhibited <b>the</b> growth of the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.
