5|$|In {{recent years}} the IMA has begun to focus on {{developing}} its contemporary art collection, which includes works such as Two White Dots in the Air by Alexander Calder and Light and Space III, a permanent installation by Robert Irwin located in the Pulliam Great Hall. Since 2007 the museum has featured site-specific contemporary installations in the Efroymson Pavilion, rotating the <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> every six months. The Efroymson Pavilion has featured works by artists such as William Lamson, Ball-Nogues Studio, Orly Genger, and Heather Rowe to name a few. Contemporary art is also featured in 100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park, which is unique in its inclusion of commissioned works by emerging mid-career artists. Since 2007, the IMA has committed to building a modern design collection that illustrates the artistic merits of utilitarian objects. The focus on international contemporary design, combined {{with the opening of}} the Miller House in 2011, is expected to reposition the museum as an authority on design.|$|E

Because of the nature of the position, Harrison did not order <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> to be created around the position, as was ordinarily done by encamped armies. The Yellow Jacket company, with Captain Spier Spencer in command, was posted on the {{southern}} end of the camp perimeter. The rest of the militia formed a rectangular formation along the edges of the bluff surrounding the camp. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Bartholomew commanded the Indiana militia units guarding the steep bluff on the eastern side of the formation. The regulars, commanded by Major Floyd, and the dragoons, commanded by Maj. Joseph Daveiss and former congressman Capt. Benjamin Parke, were kept behind the main line in reserve.|$|E

60|$|The {{spot where}} Maxwell wrought {{was at the}} extreme end of the {{unfinished}} part of the breakwater. He was busily engaged {{at the time in}} laying a large stone which hung suspended to a travelling-crane connected with the <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> overhead. Joe refrained from interrupting him. Another man assisted him. In the diver fraternity, there are men who thoroughly understand all sorts of handicrafts--there are blacksmiths, carpenters, stone-masons, etcetera. Maxwell was a skilled mechanic, and could do his work as well under water as many a man does above it-- perhaps better than some! The bed for the stone had been carefully prepared on a mass of solid masonry which had been already laid. By means of the signal-line Maxwell directed the men in charge of the crane to move it forward, backward, to the right or to the left, as required. At last it hung precisely over the required spot, and was lowered into its final resting-place.|$|E
60|$|Alarmed at {{rumors of}} this {{impending}} danger, the Astorians suspended their regular labor, {{and set to}} work, with all haste, to throw up <b>temporary</b> <b>works</b> for refuge and defense. In {{the course of a}} few days they surrounded their dwelling-house and magazines with a picket fence ninety feet square, flanked by two bastions, on which were mounted four four-pounders. Every day they exercised themselves in the use of their weapons, so as to qualify themselves for military duty, and at night ensconced themselves in their fortress and posted sentinels, to guard against surprise. In this way they hoped, even in case of attack, to be able to hold out until the arrival of the party to be conducted by Mr. Hunt across the Rocky Mountains, or until the return of the Tonquin. The latter dependence, however, was doomed soon to be destroyed. Early in August, a wandering band of savages from the Strait of Juan de Fuca made their appearance {{at the mouth of the}} Columbia, where they came to fish for sturgeon. They brought disastrous accounts of the Tonquin, which were at first treated as fables, but which were too sadly confirmed by a different tribe that arrived a few days subsequently. We shall relate the circumstances of this melancholy affair as correctly as the casual discrepancies in the statements that have reached us will permit.|$|E
40|$|<b>Temporary</b> <b>work</b> {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing {{branches}} in Germany. This development in a sustained manner influences the whole German labour market. The special organization of this sort of employment for various reasons makes it very attractive to employers and employees as well. Nevertheless, the reputation of this branch is rather poor. <b>Temporary</b> <b>work</b> is characterized as precarious and as an unsafe type of employment. Compared to regular employment, <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> is often considered as a bridging function into regular employment. Based on the official statistics of <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> released by the Federal Work Agency as well as on data from the German Socio-economic Panel (SOEP) for 2007, the paper presents the current situation and important characteristics of <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> and performs an international comparison. The number of employees in <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> agencies is still a marginal share of total employment. The future development of this branch depends on different factors leading to possible contradicting directions. One important aspect influencing <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> in the future is the degree of flexibility of regular employment opportunities on the one hand and the possibilities of <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> agencies to adapt to future working conditions on the other hand. Looking at other European countries, one can see that some degree of saturation in different temporary job opportunities has already been achieved, whereas new perspectives are opened for other jobs, either newly created or transformed from regular employment schemes. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Temporary</b> <b>work</b> has {{expanded}} {{in the last}} three decades with adverse implications for inequalities. Because temporary workers are a constituency that is unlikely to impose political costs, governments often choose to reduce <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> regulations. While most European countries have indeed implemented such reforms, France went in the opposite direction, despite having both rigid labor markets and high unemployment. My argument to solve this puzzle is that where replaceability is high, workers in permanent and temporary contracts have overlapping interests, and governments choose to regulate <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> to protect permanent workers. In turn, replaceability is higher where permanent workers’ skills are general and wage coordination is low. Logistic regression analysis of the determinants of replaceability—and how this affects governments’ reforms of <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> regulations—supports my argument. Process tracing of French reforms also confirm that the left has tightened <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> regulations to compensate for the high replaceability...|$|R

40|$|Changes in the {{structure}} and regulation of employment in Japan differentially impact men and women. The labor force participation of Japanese women is increasing, but women’s employment is concentrated in relatively deregulated and flexible forms of non-standard and precarious employment. Women and men have relatively equal levels of unemployment at present, but the flexibility which characterizes part-time and <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> lands women {{into the ranks of}} the unemployed throughout their life course, while men are more likely to experience unemployment at the entry and exit points to the labor market. Unemployment measures are directed mainly at alleviating the sources of male unemployment. Employment deregulation in Japan embodies varying degrees of re-regulation depending on the gender composition of work types. Part-time work is undertaken primarily by women, and remains relatively deregulated and unprotected. <b>Temporary</b> <b>work</b> regulations vary according to whether the occupations are typically performed by women (deregulated <b>temporary</b> <b>work)</b> or men (tightly regulated <b>temporary</b> <b>work).</b> Working hours have been deregulated for both men and women, but coupled with the deregulation of <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> in female-dominated occupations, the change poses a greater disadvantage for women.

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{government}} policy on the incidence of <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> by analysing the case of British Columbia (BC), Canada. The analysis is based upon the Canadian Labour Force Survey 1997 – 2004; <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> is defined as work that is not expected to last for more than 6 months and includes seasonal, fixed‐term, casual, and <b>temporary</b> help agency <b>work.</b> A case study of BC provides a valuable opportunity to assess the impacts of neoliberal government policy, designed to increase labour market flexibility, on the extent of <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> because we are able to compare labour market trends in BC {{both before and after the}} reforms introduced in 2001 and to compare BC with other provinces in Canada that were not subject to such large changes in their policy environments. We find that the shift to neoliberal policies in BC led to significant increases in the likelihood of workers finding themselves in temporary employment. We also find that the likelihood of being a temporary worker in BC in the post‐policy change period increases relative to all other provinces over the same period. Taken together, these results indicate that government policy is a key determinant of the level of <b>temporary</b> <b>work.</b> As such, the level of <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> should be seen as a policy‐sensitive variable, rather than as a phenomenon determined solely by the exogenous forces of globalization and technological change. <b>temporary</b> <b>work,</b> flexibility, labour markets, neoliberalism, government policy, J 21, J 48, J 81, O 51,...|$|R
