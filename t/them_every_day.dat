25|$|In 1888 his mother, Pilar Defilló de Casals, who {{was born}} in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico of Catalan ancestry, took him to Barcelona, where he {{enrolled}} in the Escola Municipal de Música. There he studied cello, theory, and piano. In 1890, when he was 13, he found in a second-hand sheet music store in Barcelona a tattered copy of Bach's six cello suites. He spent the next 13 years practicing <b>them</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> before he would perform them in public for the first time. Casals would later make his own version of the six suites.|$|E
25|$|On 16 July, the Ottoman Army, having {{concentrated}} more forces {{than the}} Russians, thwarted a planned Russian offensive {{and pushed the}} Russian Army back at the Battle of Manzikert (10–26 July 1915), capturing the city. There then followed the Battle of Kara Killisse which saw the Russian recapture of Manzikert. As {{a result of these}} operations to the north of Lake Van, the Russians evacuated their remaining combat forces from the city of Van. Armen Garo, and his assistant, Khetcho asked General Abatzieff to permit the Armenian inhabitants in the Van area to move with the Russian army toward Igdir. This request was rejected {{on the grounds that the}} movement of vital Russian army transports could not done promptly if hampered by refugees. For eight consecutive days during July, General Nikolaeff kept the Armenian leaders idle. The Russian General told <b>them</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> that he would not retreat under any circumstances, and that therefore it was entirely needless to remove the people.|$|E
500|$|Pileggi had {{to endure}} long bouts of make-up application. To create the {{principal}} illusion of monstrous veins, long black faux-veins were glued onto his face, arms, and torso. Pileggi, who had {{had to endure}} little to no make-up during the early seasons, noted that, [...] "They did a beautiful job and [...] looked awesome, but man, I hated it! I really don't know how those guys on Star Trek or Babylon 5 can stand having that done to <b>them</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> I just wouldn't work if that's what it took". To show the nanobot infection progressing, special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich used two different make-up sets. The two sets were then mixed together electronically in post-production to give the effect of disease progression. The nanobots in the blood sample were designed on a computer and then cloned with an animation program. Composer Mark Snow's score for the episode was inspired by Daniel Sackheim's [...] "big-time feature-like action".|$|E

60|$|For common extasies, he had <b>them</b> almost <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> {{especially}} at the altar, and after the sacrifice of the mass: insomuch, that many times they could not bring him to himself, with pulling him by the robe, and violently shaking him.|$|R
5000|$|Al-Biruni, the Persian historian, {{who visited}} {{and lived in}} India for 16 years from about 1017, {{mentions}} the practice of charity and almsgiving among Hindus as he observed during his stay.

2500|$|On 23 August 2014, EU justice {{commissioner}} Martine Reicherts {{emphasized that}} the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact [...] "of Nazi Germany under Hitler and the Soviet Union under Stalin would {{pave the way for}} the most brutal war to this day, leading to many years of fear, horror and pain for the victims of these regimes," [...] stating that the Europe-wide Day of Remembrance for the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes is a reminder that we must not take [...] "dignity, freedom, democracy, {{the rule of law and}} human rights" [...] for granted, and that [...] "peace, democracy and fundamental rights are not a given. We have to defend <b>them,</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> of the year." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Mary was three, Godwin {{left his}} daughters {{in the care}} of James Marshall while he {{travelled}} to Ireland. Godwin's tone in his letters demonstrates how much he cared about them. [...] His letters show the stress he placed on giving his two daughters a sense of security. [...] "And now what shall I say for my poor little girls? I hope they have not forgot me. I think of <b>them</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> and should be glad, if the wind was more favourable, to blow them a kiss a-piece from Dublin to the Polygon.. but I have seen none that I love so well or think half so good as my own." ...|$|E
2500|$|Glover and Stanning {{retained}} their World {{title at}} the 2015 World Rowing Championships in Lac d'Aiguebelette, France, on 5 September. They won their heat in 7:04 minutes and qualified directly for the semi-final which they won in 07:06 minutes. They lead the final {{from the start}} and finished in 6:52.99, 2 seconds outside their own world record, defeating the New Zealand silver medalists, Grace Prendergast and Kerri Gowler, by 3.8 seconds. Multiple Olympic gold medalist Sir Steve Redgrave said [...] "Glover and Stanning dominate any combination that is put up against them.", whilst their coach Robin Williams said “The coach shouldn’t be that impressed I suppose, since I see <b>them</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> but I’m just lost for words, quite stunning.”. Sir David Tanner, Britain’s rowing chief, declared it “one of the best GB performances of all-time … utterly exceptional,”.|$|E

60|$|Captain Kendall, who, {{because he}} has made two voyages to the Indies, {{believes}} himself a wondrously wise man, says that he who eats sweet potatoes at least once each day will not live above seven years, and he who eats <b>them</b> twice <b>every</b> <b>day</b> will become blind, after which all his teeth will drop out.|$|R

25|$|People {{escape from}} {{ordinary}} life partly through the alcohol many consume in their festive quest, but more so through the roles they portray in costume.

6000|$|... "Wholly. Religion is {{an effort}} of {{imagination}} and, therefore, {{is more or less}} a matter of disposition. That is one of its chief absurdities. Women and sensitive boys are easiest affected by it.

60|$|CRAMPTON. I've always cracked nuts with them: {{what else}} are they for? (Dogmatically.) The proper way to keep teeth good is to give them plenty of use on bones and nuts, and wash <b>them</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> with soap--- plain yellow soap.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] I said; [...] "you {{could not}} get them up to me. But, leaning against the hotel wall, on this side, in the corner, just inside of the garden gate, are some fishing-poles.

5000|$|In an interview, Denis said, [...] "One of {{the cast}} had {{actually}} been in the Legion, so we took all their real exercises and did <b>them</b> together <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> to concentrate the actors as a group.

60|$|It was queer, she thought, {{how much}} of the wrappings of civilization had slipped from <b>them</b> already. <b>Every</b> <b>day</b> of the journey from London had {{released}} them or deprived them--she hardly knew which--of a multitude of petty comforts and easy accessibilities. The afternoon toil uphill intensified the effect of having clambered up out of things--to this loneliness, this twilight openness, this simplicity.|$|R
6000|$|... "I told you, Louis," [...] I answered, [...] "that {{my mission}} in Paris {{is of the}} nature of a search.
