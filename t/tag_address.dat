The bootloader locates the DTB in the boot image {{based on an}} offset at a specific address in the boot image’s kernel image. We modified the BMA at that address with an offset that points straight after the BMA. This allowed us to append a minimal DTB to the BMA, which the bootloader accepts. The bootloader relocates the DTB to the <b>tags</b> <b>address.</b> We do not overwrite crucial data, because at that location, former constant valued DTBs can be found. The bootloader required no ramdisk or second stage bootloader. To flash the boot image to the device, we used the tool Fastboot [36]. The connection to the UART interface is established via the device’s headphone socket. Therefore, we crafted a 3.3 V USB to serial cable that we soldered onto a headphone jack.|$|R

40|$|Chemical <b>address</b> <b>tags</b> can {{be defined}} as {{specific}} structural features shared by a set of bioimaging probes having a predictable influence on cell-associated visual signals obtained from these probes. Here, using a large image dataset acquired with a high content screening instrument, machine vision and cheminformatics analysis have been applied to reveal chemical <b>address</b> <b>tags.</b> With a combinatorial library of fluorescent molecules, fluorescence signal intensity, spectral, and spatial features characterizing each one of the probes' visual signals were extracted from images acquired with the three different excitation and emission channels of the imaging instrument. With multivariate regression, the additive contribution from each one of the different building blocks of the bioimaging probes toward each measured, cell-associated image-based feature was calculated. In this manner, variations in the chemical features of the molecules were associated with the resulting staining patterns, facilitating quantitative, objective analysis of chemical <b>address</b> <b>tags.</b> Hierarchical clustering and paired image-cheminformatics analysis revealed key structure–property relationships amongst many building blocks of the fluorescent molecules. The results point to different chemical modifications of the bioimaging probes that can exert similar (or different) effects on the probes' visual signals. Inspection of the clustered structures suggests intramolecular charge migration or partial charge distribution as potential mechanistic determinants of chemical <b>address</b> <b>tag</b> behavior. © 2010 International Society for Advancement of Cytometr...|$|R

50|$|Constraint Grammar (CG) is a methodological {{paradigm}} for {{natural language processing}} (NLP). Linguist-written, context dependent rules are compiled into a grammar that assigns grammatical tags ("readings") to words or other tokens in running text. Typical <b>tags</b> <b>address</b> lemmatisation (lexeme or base form), inflexion, derivation, syntactic function, dependency, valency, case roles, semantic type etc. Each rule either adds, removes, selects or replaces a tag or a set of grammatical tags in a given sentence context. Context conditions {{can be linked to}} any tag or tag set of any word anywhere in the sentence, either locally (defined distances) or globally (undefined distances). Context conditions in the same rule may be linked, i.e. conditioned upon each other, negated, or blocked by interfering words or tags. Typical CGs consist of thousands of rules, that are applied set-wise in progressive steps, covering ever more advanced levels of analysis. Within each level, safe rules are used before heuristic rules, and no rule is allowed to remove the last reading of a given kind, thus providing a high degree of robustness.|$|R

Proteins that are transported by the endoplasmic reticulum throughout the cell are marked with an <b>address</b> <b>tag</b> called a signal sequence. The N-terminus (one end) of a polypeptide chain (i.e., a protein) contains a few amino acids that work as an <b>address</b> <b>tag,</b> which are removed when the polypeptide reaches its destination. Nascent peptides reach the ER via the translocon, a membrane-embedded multiprotein complex. Proteins that are destined for places outside the endoplasmic reticulum are packed into transport vesicles and moved along the cytoskeleton toward their destination. In human fibroblasts, the ER is always co-distributed with microtubules and the depolymerisation of the latter cause its co-aggregation with mitochondria, which are also associated with the ER.|$|R

Such protein microarrays (''protein chips'') can be used very efficiently to analyze all kind of protein interactions en masse. Although {{a variety of methods}} are available for attaching proteins on solid surfaces. Most of them rely on non-specific adsorption methods or on the reaction of chemical groups within proteins (mainly, amino and carboxylic acid groups) with complementary reactive groups. In both cases the protein is attached to the surface in random orientations. The use of recombinant affinity <b>tags</b> <b>addresses</b> the orientation issue, however in most of the cases the interaction of the tags are reversible (e. g., glutathione S-transferase, maltose binding protein and poly-His) and, hence, are not stable over the course of subsequent assays or require large mediator proteins (e. g., biotin-avidin and antigen antibody). The key for the covalent attachment of a protein to a solid support with a total control over the orientation is to introduce two unique and mutually reactive groups on both the protein and the surface. The reaction between these two groups should be highly selective thus behaving like a molecular ''velcro''...|$|R

This feature, added to the native radio energy-harvesting capability and the extremely low power consumption, has attracted the interest of research and industrial communities and pushed them to include the RFID technology into a global network of interconnected objects, as envisaged by the Internet of Things paradigm. In the last few years, standardization bodies have made significant efforts to design lightweight approaches, such as CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol), to efficiently manage resource-constrained nodes by using traditional web interfaces; nevertheless, RFID integration is not addressed yet.
