5|$|In 1953, after {{returning}} from military service in Germany, Banks married his first wife Mollye Ector. He proposed {{to her in a}} letter from Germany. Although he filed for divorce two years later, the couple briefly reconciled in early 1959. By that summer, they agreed on a divorce settlement that would pay $65,000 to Ector in lieu of alimony. Shortly thereafter, Banks eloped with Eloyce Johnson. The couple had twin sons within a year and a daughter four years after that. Ector filed suit against Banks in 1963 for failure <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>payments</b> on a life insurance policy agreed upon in their divorce settlement.|$|E

DiSuvero was a {{native-born}} Italian {{who grew up in}} Tientsin, China, and had been successful with a jade mine in California. DiSuvero's expertise was in marketing: he formed a company called Sapphire Trading to cut and market the Yogos. He had novel marketing ideas but was not knowledgeable about the mining side of the business. Unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>payments,</b> his venture folded in late 1979.|$|E
5|$|Libia {{marked a}} major {{advancement}} over earlier designs, owing {{in large part}} {{due to the fact that}} the ship was originally ordered by the Ottoman Navy. Based on the British-built , the ship was to have been named Drama, but the Ottoman government failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>payments</b> so construction stopped, and she was seized after the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War and completed for the Regia Marina. She was significantly larger, faster, and more heavily armored than the other Italian protected cruisers, but she carried a weaker main battery.|$|E

5|$|Cohen had {{acquired}} reprint {{rights to the}} magazines' back issues, although Wrzos did get Cohen to agree to print one new story every issue. Cohen was also producing reprint magazines such as Great Science Fiction and Science Fiction Classics, but no payment was made to authors {{for any of these}} reprints. This brought Cohen into conflict with the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA), a professional writers' organization formed in 1965. Soon SFWA called for a boycott of Ultimate's magazines until Cohen agreed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>payments.</b> Cohen agreed to pay a flat fee for all stories, and then in August 1967 this was changed to a graduated rate, depending on the length of the story. Harry Harrison had acted as an intermediary in Cohen's negotiations with SFWA, and when Wrzos left in 1967, Cohen asked Harrison to take over. SF Impulse, which Harrison had been editing, had folded in February 1967, so Harrison was available. He secured Cohen's agreement that the policy of printing almost nothing but reprinted stories would be phased out {{by the end of the}} year, and took over as editor with the September 1967 issue.|$|E
