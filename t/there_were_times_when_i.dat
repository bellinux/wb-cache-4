500|$|While some {{commentators}} claimed Mercury hid his sexual orientation from the public, others {{claimed he was}} [...] "openly gay". In December 1974, when asked directly, [...] "So how about being bent?" [...] by the New Musical Express, Mercury replied, [...] "You're a crafty cow. Let's put it this way: <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was young and green. It's a thing schoolboys go through. I've had my share of schoolboy pranks. I'm not going to elaborate further." [...] Homosexual acts between adult males {{over the age of}} 21 had been decriminalised in the United Kingdom in 1967, only seven years earlier. In the 1980s, he would often distance himself from his partner, Jim Hutton, during public events. In October 1986, The Sun claimed Mercury had [...] "confessed to a string of one-night gay sex affairs".|$|E

I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E

I had Godric narrate his own life, and despite the problem of {{developing}} a language that sounded authentic on his lips without becoming impenetrably archaic, and despite the difficulties of trying to recapture {{a time and place}} so unlike my own, the book, like Lion Country before it, came so quickly and with such comparative ease that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> suspected that maybe the old saint himself was not entirely uninvolved in the process, as, were I a saint and were somebody writing a book about me, I would not be entirely uninvolved in the process either." ...|$|E

2500|$|During her Janet World Tour, Jackson {{experienced}} an emotional breakdown, stemming from self-hatred, childhood humiliation, self-harm, and distorted body image. She stated, [...] "I was very, very sad. Very down. I couldn't get up sometimes. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> felt very hopeless and helpless, and I felt like walls {{were kind of}} closing in on me...like you can't escape". She questioned her career path, feeling pressured by {{the demands of the}} entertainment industry, saying, [...] "People look at you differently, as if you're not human." [...] Abbie Kearse of MTV responded, [...] "You're creating a person who might not really be you, but you've created this fantasy woman, so when it's time to get back to business, it's like 'I've {{got to go back to}} that world'". Jackson expressed concern for how she could portray an object of fantasy, feeling as if she could no longer fulfill her own desires.|$|E

6000|$|... "I love you," [...] he said; [...] "I {{have known}} it since I have known you, but you must see why I could not tell you so. It was very hard, for <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> led myself {{to believe that you}} might come to love me. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> should have gone away if I hadn't made a promise to stay in Ripton.

I cannot give you that to which you have been {{accustomed}} all your life, that which you have here at Fairview, but I shouldn't say this to you if I believed that you cared for them above--other things." ...|$|E
60|$|As for Edith Croyden, I {{can only}} say that as she stood beside me on the beach in her suit of black {{goatskin}} (she had chosen the black spots) <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> felt like seizing her in the frenzy of my passion and hurling her into the sea.

60|$|Odd, {{the poor}} opinion a man always has--when {{he is in}} love--of his {{personal}} attractions. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> thought of Grace Bates, Heloise Miller, and Clarice Wembley, when I felt {{like one of the}} beasts that perish.

50|$|This treaty {{proved that}} a {{stalemate}} between Ottoman Empire and Safavid Persia {{had been reached}} and neither side might gain substantial territories in the long run. In the following decades <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> the Ottomans succeeded to storm Tabriz, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> the Persians successfully captured Baghdad.

60|$|But while <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> rejoiced in {{the idea}} that my sufferings were to be endless, I could not bear them to be without meaning.

That something hidden away in my nature, like a treasure in a field, is Humility.|$|E
60|$|Somehow, {{her stories}} began to affect me {{in spite of}} myself. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> felt very dreary. Perhaps Aunt Philippa was right. Perhaps men possessed neither truth nor constancy. Certainly Mark had {{forgotten}} me. I was ashamed of myself because this hurt me so much, but I could not help it. I grew pale and listless. Aunt Philippa sometimes peered at me sharply, but she held her peace. I was grateful for this.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{generally}} {{there was}} little excitement. I did not, as you can suppose, take the sensation line; spoke very rapidly, for I {{had no time to}} spare--but clearly and quietly, sometimes gravely, sometimes with exceeding earnestness, and exposed sophistries and fallacies and errors about the incapacity of the black races, &c. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> lost all sense of nervousness and self, and only wished that 10,000 people had been present, for I felt that I was speaking out, face to face, plain simple words of truth.|$|E

I set my teeth, though my skin was presently afire, all my body afire; but I lay there like grim death. I understood now how it was the cat had howled until I chloroformed it.
