5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1838 of another fighter, William Phelps, {{also known as}} Brighton Bill, in a match against Owen Swift, the London Prize Ring Rules were {{introduced}} by the Pugilists's Protective Association to more clearly define the range of fouls and to introduce certain safety measures. Butting, gouging, biting, scratching, kicking were all forbidden as {{was the use of}} stones or any hard object in the hand. Thirty-second breaks were introduced between rounds, {{at the end of which}} each fighter had <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scratch unaided within 8seconds. The wearing of spiked boots was prohibited, and boxers who went to ground without being hit were disqualified. These rules still form the basis for the modern sport of boxing.|$|E
5|$|Harrison allowed Secretary of State-designate Daniel Webster to edit {{his inauguration}} speech, but he {{nevertheless}} spoke {{for an hour}} and 45 minutes, setting a record for verbosity that still stands. As the public was not excluded from the White House, there was no relief from the swarms of office seekers even after March 4, and relations with Clay broke down {{to such an extent that}} President Harrison banned him from the White House. Clay left town, never to see the President again. Harrison, despite the office seekers, liked <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> market each morning but on March 24 got caught in the rain and soon fell ill. The primitive treatment he received, possibly influenced by his own medical training a half-century old, did nothing to improve his condition, and he died in the early morning hours of April 4. Vice President Tyler had returned to his home in Virginia once the Senate adjourned, and Secretary of State Webster sent his son Fletcher to inform Tyler of Harrison's death.|$|E

5|$|Players {{can either}} choose {{to play a}} ranked Deathmatch or DarkOps, {{where they will be}} matched with other players using a system called TrueSkill Matchmaking, or they may choose a player match where they can choose their game from a list of player hosted games. Like the {{original}} Perfect Dark, these games can be highly customized and can also include computer game bots. Features such as their difficulty and behavior can be changed to match player preference. For example, the Judge bot always attacks leading players with the highest kills score. Players can also issue commands to them {{as long as they are}} on their respective team, such as follow or hold position, and set waypoints for them <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to.</b> <b>The</b> game includes by default six different maps and each has two variants; the only change is the placement of the bases. Most of the maps are large ones, ideal for 32 players at once, with small variants for 4-16 player games.|$|E
5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher {{attend a}} museum, where they {{discover}} a broken time machine {{built in the}} 1880s on display. Endeavoring to travel through time themselves, they begin fixing it to work properly. This catches the attention of their sister, Candace, who desires to inform their mother of their activities to get in trouble. When she finally gets their mother Linda to follow her and view the machine, Linda becomes distracted while Candace continues <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boys, just as their time machine activates. The three are {{sent back to the}} Late Cretaceous Period (erroneously stated to be in 300 million B.C.), where a Tyrannosaurus rex immediately destroys the time machine. Now stranded, the three are forced to flee from the T. rex and are eventually saved by a herd of Alamosaurus lounging in a large pond.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry and hot weather. Michael Schumacher clinched his ninth pole position of the season, his second at the circuit, with a time of 1:37.397. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Häkkinen who recorded a lap time 0.463 seconds slower than the pole sitter. Coulthard qualified third and suffered a worrying moment when a fire on his McLaren caused petrol to seep into his eye and admitted the incident could have escalated if not dealt with quickly. Barrichello, who was still suffering from flu, qualified fourth having been pushed from second position in the closing seconds of the session. Wurz qualified fifth, in his best qualifying performance of the season. Villeneuve secured the sixth fastest time despite having <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pit lane when his BAR's engine was turned off on his final run. Irvine made changes to his set-up and secured seventh although he believed he could have been quicker as he backed off through turn 15. Ralf Schumacher lost four-tenths of a second on his fastest lap and managed eighth. Trulli and Frentzen rounded out the top ten qualifying positions for Jordan. Zonta missed qualifying in the top ten by two-tenths of a second and lost time with a braking issue. Herbert, in his final Formula One race, qualified twelfth and struggled with understeer following an engine change. He was ahead of Fisichella, de la Rosa and Verstappen. Jenson Button qualified 16th and encountered traffic during the session which prevented him from setting a faster lap time. The Sauber, Prost and Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid, covering positions 17 to 22.|$|E

There {{appears to be a}} good relationship between the school and the village, and the students get on well with the locals. Favourite places in Hogsmeade include Honeydukes Sweetshop, Zonko's Joke Shop, clothing stores such as Gladrags Wizardwear, the Shrieking Shack (regarded as the most haunted building in Britain), the pubs The Three Broomsticks and The Hog's Head, and Madam Puddifoot's coffee shop.|$|E
25|$|Under the Zaydi rule, the Jews were {{considered}} to be impure, and therefore forbidden to touch a Muslim or a Muslim's food. They were obligated to humble themselves before a Muslim, <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left side, and greet him first. They could not build houses higher than a Muslim's or ride a camel or horse, and when riding on a mule or a donkey, they had to sit sideways. Upon entering the Muslim quarter a Jew had to take off his foot-gear and walk barefoot. If attacked with stones or fists by youth, a Jew was not allowed to fight them. In such situations he had the option of fleeing or seeking intervention by a merciful Muslim passerby.|$|E

25|$|As the {{dry season}} takes effect, the islets on the crest become wider and more numerous, and in September to January {{up to half of}} the rocky face of the falls may become dry and the bottom of the First Gorge can be seen along most of its length. At this time it becomes {{possible}} (though not necessarily safe) to walk across some stretches of the river at the crest. It is also possible <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the First Gorge at the Zimbabwean side. The minimum flow, which occurs in November, is around a tenth of the April figure; this variation in flow is greater than that of other major falls, and causes Victoria Falls' annual average flow rate to be lower than might be expected based on the maximum flow.|$|E
25|$|Southdown Motors {{operated}} three bus {{services at}} the time: no. 19 between Newick and Lewes via Barcombe Cross, and nos. 119 and 122 between Lewes and Uckfield via the A26 with a stop at Barcombe Lane. As a condition of the Minister's consent to closure, additional bus services were laid on from August 1968. No. 122 additionally called at Isfield Station and provided an hourly service to and from Uckfield, but no. 119 departed Uckfield two minutes before the incoming rail service arrived. Barcombe Mills and Isfield stations remained open to sell tickets. However, as the buses were unable to negotiate the narrow winding road to Barcombe Mills, they stopped one mile short of the station: BRB laid on taxis to ferry passengers to the bus stop, but passengers first had <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station to buy their tickets.|$|E
25|$|The Bhagavata Purana also narrates: Krishna's {{elder brother}} Balarama was staying in Ambadi on Yamuna's banks {{for a few}} months. Once, he was frolicking with the gopis on the river banks and desired {{to play in the}} waters. Intoxicated with liquor and {{experiencing}} heat of the alcohol, Balarama felt to take a bath in the river. However, he refused <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waters and called upon the river to come near him, but the chaste Yamuna refused despite repeated orders from Balarama. An angry Balarama dragged the river by his weapon – the plough and changed its course, hurting the river goddess. Terrified, the river assumed her form as a goddess and bowed to Balarama and asked his forgiveness. A calmed Balarama ordered the river to flood the forest so he could bathe and play in her waters, and the river complied.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, mine {{officials}} disliked by {{union members}} were {{driven out of}} the area under death threats. In January 1894, the manager of the Isabella mine at Cripple Creek, Mr. Locke, was captured by a large body of armed men, and made to swear that he would leave and never return without permission of the miners, and that he would not identify those who forced him to leave. Once he gave assurances, he was allowed to get on a horse and leave the district.p.22 In July 1894, a group of about 20 to 40 armed men came to the Gem mine in the Coeur D’Alene district in Idaho, searching for men who had been ordered by union miners to leave the country. They found one, John Kneebone, and shot and killed him. They then forced the mine superintendent and some other mine officials <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Montana state line, and made them promise never to return.|$|E
