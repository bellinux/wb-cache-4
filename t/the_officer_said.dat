The Australian government initiated an investigation. The newspaper said the officer's account was the reason that the government had settled with Habib in December 2010. <b>The</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said</b> there were videotapes of interrogations of Habib.|$|E

He also claimed that he was assisting Ningbo's PSB during his time there, and had never heard of the Central Investigation Team. Sing Tao Daily published a retort by a case officer in Ningbo, saying that Lam and his girlfriend had signed confessions to having been engaged in [...] "illegal business operations" [...] and agreements not to hire lawyers nor see their families. <b>The</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said</b> Lam was on bail, and was allowed to return to Hong Kong to attend to personal matters.|$|E
500|$|The group {{expressed}} its {{belief that}} the faster that they accomplish independence, the faster that they can begin associating with other Latin American nations and consolidate efforts with its counterparts. Believing that the local and federal governments had [...] "extreme repressive and oppressive economic measures against the people" [...] to unprecedented levels, Guasábara warned that privatization of services would bring [...] "a raise in costs" [...] and [...] "meager salaries", also citing that constitutional rights were being violated by the Fortuño administration noting that under Rivera Schatz the general public {{was not allowed to}} openly protest at the Senate of Puerto Rico. The EPB derided the government's raise of the UPR's tuition and the withdrawal of funds for cultural organizations. It also expressed support to those opposing the Via Verde project, stating that it would [...] "destroy the environment [...] endanger human life and property". All of these conditions convinced the Macheteros that the conditions for a public revolt were being formed, citing that they would [...] "do everything in their power to convince the people {{that there is a need}} to defend themselves". Guasábara admitted that the organization was receiving information concerning military and political strategies that the United States intended to enact in Puerto Rico and that they employ it to remain elusive and to prepare counter measures, only making a portion of it public, but refused to reveal their sources. When questioned about the possibility of reopening a line of inquiry with the Catholic Church (an initiative abandoned in 2005 after the death of Ojeda Ríos), <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said</b> that the EPB is open [...] "to chat [...] exchange ideas", but that they would not abandon armed resistance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lawsuit was}} settled for $25,000 and the {{attorney}} for <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> of <b>the</b> officers,"They don’t want to be embroiled in this whole messaging scandal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{an unusual}} strategist," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said.</b> He traced <b>the</b> line. [...] "It's an ancient maneuver, an old Prussian device, but it worked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have asked}} the prisoners," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "and they tell an {{extraordinary}} story, that the devil has just thrown him into the fire!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In November 2007, {{allegations}} from {{an anonymous}} U.S. military officer, that a high-level political agreement {{had occurred in}} the Hicks case, were reported. <b>The</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "one of our staffers was present when Vice-President Cheney interfered directly to get Hicks's plea bargain deal. He did it apparently, {{as part of a}} deal cut with Howard". Australian Prime Minister John Howard denied any involvement in Hicks's plea bargain.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2008, a New York Times article claimed, citing unnamed CIA officers, that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed {{was held}} in a secret {{facility}} in Poland near Szymany Airport, about [...] north of Warsaw {{and it was there}} where he was interrogated and the waterboarding was applied. It is claimed that waterboarding was used about 100 times over a period of two weeks before Khalid Sheikh Mohammed began to cooperate. In September 2008, two anonymous Polish intelligence officers made the claims about facilities being located in Poland in the Polish daily newspaper Dziennik. One of them stated that between 2002 and 2005 the CIA held terror suspects inside a military intelligence training base in Stare Kiejkuty in north-eastern Poland. <b>The</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said</b> only the CIA had access to the isolated zone, which was used because it was a secure site far from major towns and was close to a former military airport. Both Prime Minister Leszek Miller and President Aleksander Kwasniewski knew about the base, the newspaper reported. However, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said</b> it was unlikely either man knew if the prisoners were being tortured because the Poles had no control over the Americans' activities. On January 23, 2009, The Guardian reported that the CIA had run black sites at Szymany Airport in Poland, Camp Eagle in Bosnia and Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo. The United States has refused to cooperate with a Polish investigation into the matter, according to the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, {{the renewal}} of the {{concession}} for the U.S. military base in Manta, Ecuador was met by considerable criticism, derision, and even doubt by the supporters of such an expansion. The near-war sparked by the 2008 Andean diplomatic crisis was expressed by a high-level Ecuadorean military officer as being carried under American auspices. <b>The</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said</b> [...] "a large proportion of senior officers," [...] share [...] "the conviction that the United States was an accomplice in the attack" [...] (launched on by the Colombian military on a FARC camp in Ecuador, near the Colombian border). The Ecuadorean military retaliated by stating the 10-year lease on the base, which expired in November 2009, would not be renewed and that the U.S. military presence {{was expected to be}} scaled down starting three months before the expiration date.|$|E

6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place, Lindsay," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "we {{take it that}} you have come on a mission from the rajah. Does he mean to surrender?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is just as}} {{well that}} you did not," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "for Monsieur le Marquis de Pignerolles is {{probably}} the best swordsman in our army." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ritter {{was arrested}} again in November 2009 over {{communications}} with a police decoy he met on an Internet chat site. [...] Police {{said that he}} exposed himself via a web camera after <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said</b> she was a 15-year-old girl; Ritter {{said he was not}} made aware of the ostensible age of his correspondent until after the act. The next month, Ritter waived his right to a preliminary hearing and was released on a $25,000 unsecured bail. Charges included [...] "unlawful contact with a minor, criminal use of a communications facility, corruption of minors, indecent exposure, possessing instruments of crime, criminal attempt and criminal solicitation". Ritter rejected a plea bargain, testified in his trial and was found guilty of all but the criminal attempt count in a Monroe County, Pennsylvania courtroom on April 14, 2011. In October 2011 he received a sentence of one and a half to {{five and a half years}} in prison. [...] He was paroled in September 2014.|$|E
2500|$|The {{events that}} {{occurred}} immediately following the shooting were streamed live in a 10-minute video by Reynolds via Facebook. The recording appears to begin seconds after Castile was shot, just after 9:00p.m. CDT. The video depicts Castile slumped over, moaning and moving slightly, with a bloodied left arm and side. In the video, Reynolds is speaking with Yanez and explaining what happened. Reynolds stated on the video that Yanez [...] "asked him for license and registration. He {{told him that it}} was in his wallet, but he had a pistol on him because he's licensed to carry." [...] Castile did have a license to carry a gun. Reynolds further narrated that <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Don't move" [...] and as Castile was putting his hands back up, the officer shot him in the arm four or five times. Reynolds told the officer, [...] "You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir." [...] Reynolds also said [...] "Please don't tell me he's dead," [...] while Yanez exclaims: [...] "I told him not to reach for it! I told him to get his hand open!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Early {{on during}} the coup, while the special forces were still {{fighting}} before the generals forced Tung to order them to capitulate, one of his subordinates was in Gia Long Palace made a proposal to Diệm. According to the diary of one of Diệm's aides, the special forces officer drew up and proposed a surprise counter-attack on the rebel headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt using loyalist infantry and tanks. Tân Sơn Nhứt was located on the northwestern edge of the city, and <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said</b> {{that it was only}} protected by trainee soldiers. He told Diệm there was no chance that the new recruits could resist a loyalist attack and therefore the generals would be easily captured and the leadership of the coup would break down. The aide reported that Diệm turned down the proposal, saying [...] "The brigade should conserve its forces to fight the communists and avoid bloodshed. In the meantime, it should protect Gia Long Palace, the post office and the treasury." [...] Another aide believed that Diệm did not want to attack the headquarters of the JGS because [...] "it represented the authority of the armed forces" [...] and to avoid [...] "more harm, more death, more suffering for the soldiers". According to this account, Diệm [...] "was confident that his forbearance would make the coup forces realize that he was a president who always stood {{on the side of the}} masses of the population".|$|E
6000|$|... "What can be {{the matter}} now?" [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "It must be {{something}} of importance or the colonel would never hare called Hallowes out in that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{that you}} have done your supper," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I suppose {{the next thing you}} want is some clothes. The {{question}} is how to get them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's it like?" [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said,</b> laughing. [...] "Spirits, I will bet a dollar, in some {{shape or}} other. Pour me out a glass. I will try it anyhow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Form the men up, and {{let them}} answer to their names," [...] <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said.</b> The men formed in line and the officer read out the names; Harry {{answering}} for Andre Leboeuf. [...] "That is all right, so far," [...] <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Now, sir, I must, according to my orders, search your vessel to see {{that no one is}} concealed there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{can save}} him," [...] <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said,</b> shaking his head. Ronald looked round; {{there was no}} rope lying {{anywhere}} on the shore.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, that {{accounts}} for the terrible blows that these fellows received," [...] <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "And your friend; was he a strong man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{will be when}} we {{come back}} from the woods," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said,</b> as he read the {{telegram}} which Jet handed him. [...] "You had better lie down an hour or so, and then we'll start." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, {{the trial}} of those fellows comes on next week," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> when <b>the</b> {{laughter}} subsided; [...] "so if the transports don't come in {{you will be able}} to see the last of them, O'Connor." ...|$|R
25|$|Six {{days after}} <b>the</b> bombing, RUC <b>officers</b> shot dead INLA members Seamus Grew and Roddie Carroll near a vehicle {{checkpoint}} in Armagh. <b>The</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> {{they believed that}} the two men were ferrying McGlinchey into Northern Ireland. Neither was armed, nor was McGlinchey in their car.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall not}} be disturbed," [...] <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said</b> respectfully, and Stanley heard a {{movement}} of feet, and then {{the closing of the}} door.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{very good}} idea," [...] <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "but {{somewhat}} dangerous; for if they caught you they would assuredly shoot you as spies." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the police}} station Jet was led {{in front of a}} high desk, and <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said</b> in reply to a {{question}} from the sergeant: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{attorney}} for <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> [...] "The mayor {{has been exposed}} and I may want more money for my clients now," [...] after it was revealed through text messages that Kilpatrick and Beatty {{were involved in a}} sexual relationship that both denied under oath.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{recognize}} the young fellow," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "He rushed out, {{half out of}} his mind with joy, as I rode past {{at the head of the}} column. Well, go on, lad. Tell us what you have got to say." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{arrival of}} {{those from the}} depot, and what the tramp had to tell, put a new face on the matter. One of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> {{he had seen the}} two strangers with the tool-bag, but had put them down for {{traveling}} salesmen visiting Crumville on business.|$|R
6000|$|... "The French general {{would hardly}} venture to do that," [...] <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said,</b> disdainfully, [...] "when {{there will be}} 50,000 Portuguese to bar his way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{important}} news indeed," [...] <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "and your conduct {{has been in}} every way most gallant. What is your name, lad?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>said,</b> passionately, [...] "you {{introduce}} them to me, not me to them. The inferior rank is introduced to the superior." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excellent," [...] <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "It {{might be}} as well," [...] one suggested, [...] "that each of the party should have a light rope wound round him, so that if one, two, or even three could not slip away, the fourth could still carry out the plan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{received}} {{a great deal of}} misplaced commiseration," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "We have all thought of you as having been tortured to death, either by Holkar or Ameer Khan; and now we find you have been better housed and better fed than we have.|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{specially}} admire," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>said,</b> laughing, [...] "is {{that any}} man should have run all this risk, on purpose, to prevent himself from coming into an earldom. You {{had only to}} leave the matter alone, and there you were--heir to title and estates." ...|$|R
