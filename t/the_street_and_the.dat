5|$|In {{overhauling}} {{the structure}} of the premises, the National Trust restored its medieval character by recreating on the ground floor the appearance of arcaded stalls opening onto <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sixteenth-century decoration of the upstairs windows, although this caused a dilemma as it required the removal of fine 18th-century windows.|$|E
5|$|As constructed, {{the main}} {{facade of the}} station faced Glenwood Avenue. The two-story {{entrance}} loggia consisted of seven arched bays, with a three-bay wing to the northeast and a two-bay wing to the southwest, and acted as a transition point between <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> station interior. The first floor (at track level) featured a large waiting room occupying the entire center block, with vault lights providing natural illumination and a fountain set into the western wall. Restrooms, a kitchen, and a cafe occupied the wings.|$|E

5|$|North Michigan Avenue is a six-lane {{two-way street}} that is {{serviced}} by Chicago Transit Authority public buses along the Magnificent Mile that connect {{the area to}} the entire Chicago metropolitan area. It is also serviced by seasonal trolley service along <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> foot of the Magnificent Mile is serviced by seasonal water transit services. Two blocks west along State Street, the Chicago 'L' rapid transit services the street via its Red Line. Pedestrian traffic abounds along the broad sidewalks that are shielded by extensive, mature greenery that provides much of the friendly atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side of London, the rebels {{approached}} Smithfield and Clerkenwell Priory, the headquarters of the Knights Hospitaller which was headed by Hales. The priory was destroyed, along with the nearby manor. Heading west along Fleet Street, the rebels attacked the Temple, a complex of legal buildings and offices owned by the Hospitallers. The contents, books and paperwork were brought out and burned in <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> buildings systematically demolished. Meanwhile, John Fordham, the Keeper of the Privy Seal and one of the men on the rebels' execution list, narrowly escaped when the crowds ransacked his accommodation but failed to notice he was still in the building.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, 1955, deHavilland married Pierre Galante, an {{executive}} {{editor for the}} French journal Paris Match. Her marriage to Galante prompted her relocation to Paris. The couple separated in 1962, but continued {{to live in the}} same house for another six years to raise their daughter together. Galante moved across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two remained close, even after the finalization of the divorce in 1979. She looked after him during his final bout with lung cancer prior to his death in 1998. They had one child, Gisèle Galante, who was born on July 18, 1956. After studying law at the Université de Droit de Nanterre School of Law, she worked as a journalist in France and the United States. Since 1956, deHavilland has lived in the same three-story house near Bois de Boulogne park in the Rive Droite section of Paris.|$|E

25|$|Until the 1640s, {{the width}} of the street varied from 10 to 20 ells (5.9-11.9 metres), but as the {{northern}} settlements were incorporated with the city in 1635, so was Helgeandsholmen, and the standard street width was regulated. Over-Governor Klas Fleming (1592–1644) had Norrbro straightened out, in line with his own site on <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> width set to 24 ells (14.3 metres).|$|E

On February 15, 1995, the space frames were brought in and the roof began to take shape. The last piece was installed in July 1995.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Chicago {{was ranked}} the sixth-most {{walkable}} large {{city in the}} United States. Many of the city's residential streets have a wide patch of grass and/or trees between <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sidewalk itself. This helps to keep pedestrians on the sidewalk further away from the street traffic. Chicago's Western Avenue is the longest continuous urban street in the world. Other famous streets include Michigan Avenue, State Street, Clark Street, and Belmont Avenue. The City Beautiful movement inspired Chicago's boulevards and parkways.|$|E

25|$|The main façade of {{the church}} faces onto the Via del Quirinale (formerly the Via Pia), as does Borromini's San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane further down the road. Unlike San Carlo, Sant’Andrea is set back from <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> space outside the church is {{enclosed}} by low curved quadrant walls. An oval cylinder encases the dome, and large volutes transfer the lateral thrust. The main façade to the street has an aedicular pedimented frame {{at the center of}} which a semicircular porch with two Ionic columns marks the main entrance. Above the porch entablature is the heraldic coat of arms of the Pamphili patron.|$|E
25|$|On July 15, 1801, Napoleon {{signed a}} Concordat with the Pope, which allowed the thirty-five {{surviving}} parish churches and two hundred chapels {{and other religious}} institutions of Paris to reopen. The 289 priests remaining in Paris were again allowed to wear their clerical costumes in <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> church bells of Paris (those which had not been melted down) rang again {{for the first time}} since the Revolution. However, the buildings and property which had been seized from the church was not returned, and the Parisian clergy were kept under the close supervision of the government; the bishop of Paris was nominated by the Emperor, and confirmed by the Pope.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, in 1882, an {{organization}} called the National Christian Association Opposed to Secret Societies called attention to William Morgan, a Batavia resident who, after a failed bid to join the local Masonic Lodge, began speaking and writing against the order and its alleged hidden influence on society and politics. His 1826 disappearance, supposedly after an abduction, helped catalyze {{the formation of an}} Anti-Masonic Party. The Association shared his sentiments, and proposed that a memorial be built to him. With $20,000 ($ in contemporary funds) raised from supporters all over the United States and Canada, the monument was built in 1882. It was placed near <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> New York Central main line to maximize its public visibility.|$|E

25|$|The {{good state}} of {{preservation}} of these buildings and their frescoes was due to their location, close to the main city wall facing west, and the military necessity to strengthen the wall. The Sassanid Persians had become adept at tunneling under such walls in order to undermine them and create breaches. As a countermeasure the Roman garrison decided to sacrifice <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> buildings along the wall by filling them with rubble to bolster the wall {{in case of a}} Persian mining operation, so the Christian chapel, the synagogue, the Mithraeum and many other buildings were entombed. They also buttressed the walls from the outside with an earthen mound forming a glacis and sealed it with a casing of mud brick to prevent erosion.|$|E
25|$|Portobello Road's {{distinctiveness}} {{does not}} rely only on its market. A range of communities inhabiting <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> district {{contributes to a}} cosmopolitan and energetic atmosphere, as do the many restaurants and pubs. The architecture plays a part too, as the road meanders and curves gracefully along most of its length, unlike the more formally planned layout {{of most of the}} nearby area. Mid- to late-Victorian terrace houses and shops predominate, squeezed tightly into the available space, adding intimacy and a pleasing scale to the streetscape. The Friends of Portobello campaign seeks to preserve the street's unique dynamic, as the potential arrival of big-brand chain stores threatens the locals. Portobello Road is also home to the Grade II* Electric Cinema, one of Britain's oldest cinemas.|$|E
25|$|Tram-trains are railcars or trains which {{run like}} trams (streetcars) in city streets, and on heavy rail tracks {{out to the}} suburbs or between the cities. Usually, this {{requires}} two current systems (German Zweisystemstadtbahn, Stadtbahn with two systems), both the tram voltage (600 or 750 V DC) and the heavy rail high voltage (in Germany, 15 kV AC). The vehicles must also be adapted to the heavy rail’s signalling system. This transit mode combines the tram’s availability with stops in <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> heavy rail’s higher speed. They are often faster than most rapid transit (metro) systems. The first system was opened in Karlsruhe in 1992. Their top speed is often 100km/h, in Kassel as much as 114km/h. Most of the tram-trains fit the definition of an interurban; in reality, this transit mode is a rebirth of the interurban.|$|E
