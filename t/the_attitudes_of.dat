5|$|As the {{demographics}} of the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were more or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> the times, tended to be villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for the homosexual was as a 'decadent slaveholding lordling' whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown by the young male heterosexual hero. During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villains.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Arab Revolt and its aftermath, Aleppo's {{political}} elite was divided between those who embraced the Arab nationalist movement led by Faisal and those who sought political autonomy for Aleppo and its hinterland within the Ottoman state. A number of factors distinguished <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> Aleppo's elite and populace from those of Damascus. For one, the economic well-being of Aleppo's inhabitants was dependent on open, commercial access to Aleppo's Anatolian hinterland, which was predominantly populated by Turks; southwestern Anatolia was the principal market for Aleppo's goods and the principal supplier of its food and raw materials.|$|E

Kennedy and Cooper had served together on the Senate Labor Committee and maintained a social friendship. On the mission, Cooper discovered that the Soviets disliked Kennedy and Nixon equally. Cooper concluded in his report to Kennedy {{that there was little}} potential for harmonious relations with the Soviets. After meeting with Secretary Khruschev, Kennedy confirmed to Cooper that his report had been correct and confessed that he should have taken it even more seriously. Cooper supported Kennedy's decision to resume nuclear weapons testing after the Soviets resumed their testing in March 1962, but he urged Kennedy to negotiate an agreement with the Soviets if possible.|$|E
5|$|The Capcom Five {{announcement}} {{came at a}} {{time when}} Nintendo had been struggling with its new console, with the apparent goal of supporting the fledgling system. However, each successive game's release reinforced Capcom's view that the GameCube was unprofitable; they ported the games one-by-one to Sony's PlayStation 2. These ports were generally inferior in quality: many reviewers noted slowdown issues and lower resolution graphics. Ultimately, four games were released and only one remained exclusive to GameCube. This lone GameCube exclusive was P.N.03 and not Resident Evil 4, as Capcom had repeatedly emphasized in press releases. GameCube owners and Nintendo fans were disappointed by the Capcom Five's failure to improve the GameCube's reputation and sales. Luke Plunkett of Kotaku noted that despite best intentions, Capcom's five even at their full potential could not have made up for the GameCube's failings in that generation's console wars. The dramatic reversal of the five is representative of <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> third-party developers toward Nintendo's platform.|$|E
40|$|Background: Internship is an {{important}} phase in medical students' training, which can have a bearing on <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> they develop towards various specialties and illnesses. Very few studies have tried to assess the effect of clinical rotation on <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> interns towards Psychiatry. This study was planned to assess the same before and after a 2 week posting in Psychiatry. Aims: To study the change in <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> interns towards psychiatry before and after clinical rotation in Psychiatry. Methods: The study sample comprised of 60 interns in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Medical Condition Regard Scale (MCRS) {{was used to assess}} <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> interns towards Psychiatry before and after a 2 week Psychiatry rotation. Non-parametric tests were used to analyze the data obtained. Results: Many individual items and the overall scores of MCRS showed significant improvement for both psychiatric illness and alcohol and drug dependence after the 2 week Psychiatry rotation. Increase in MCRS score indicates improvement in <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> towards Psychiatry. Conclusions: <b>The</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> interns towards Psychiatry improved following a 2 week clinical rotation in Psychiatry. Further studies are needed to better understand the factors that may influence <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> interns...|$|R

5|$|The way demons behave {{is based}} on their and the protagonist's {{respective}} alignments. Alignments come in two types, Light-Neutral-Dark, and Law-Neutral-Chaos. A demon's alignment can range across both alignments, resulting in nine possible stances that affect how they behave and what actions in battle or story progression pleases them. The protagonist's alignment changes depending on choices made during the story, and in response <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> people and demons change; for instance, demons who are law-aligned will refuse to form an alliance with chaos-aligned players. Additionally, depending on their alignment, players will not be let into certain areas; for instance, the Order of Messiah will not let chaos-aligned players into their churches.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} {{effect of the}} war was a psychological one. The heavy losses deeply affected many directly, and war memorials were built all over the country as people sought to remember those that had been killed. However, despite the size of Australia's contribution to the fighting, there were many Australians who had had no actual experience of it. Realising this, and having witnessed the impact of the war first hand, Charles Bean, who was instrumental in editing and writing the official history of Australia's involvement in the war, advocated the need for a national memorial {{and was one of the}} main architects in establishing the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. The experience of the war also perpetuated many notions about the Australian character and national identity that endure to this day. For many Australians the performance of their soldiers—particularly during the failed Gallipoli campaign—served to highlight the nation's emergence as a member of the international community, while bringing to the fore a belief in Australians' natural ability as soldiers. <b>The</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> many Australians towards war itself were also greatly affected. There was a widespread revulsion at the large-scale destruction and loss of life that had occurred and a desire that it should never occur again. In many regards this led to a general complacency towards defence and military matters after the war and arguably led to the nation's lack of preparedness for the next major conflict, while it may still be evident in Australian strategic behaviour to this day.|$|E
