5|$|According to Oswald Spengler, the {{characteristic}} mistake of the Gracchan age was {{to believe in}} the possibility of the reversibility of history – a form of idealism which according to Spengler was at that time shared by both sides of the political spectrum – Cato had sought <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> clock to the time of Cincinnatus, and restore virtue by returning to austerity.|$|E
5|$|In practice, {{the huge}} Valdez glacier that stood between the port and the Alaskan {{interior}} proved almost insurmountable and only 200 managed to climb it; by 1899, {{the cold and}} scurvy was causing many deaths amongst the rest. Other prospectors attempted an alternative route across the Malaspina Glacier just to the east, suffering even greater hardships. Those who did manage to cross it found themselves having to negotiate miles of wilderness before they could reach Dawson. Their expedition was forced <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> same way they had come with only four men surviving.|$|E
5|$|After spring thaw in 1852, {{the elderly}} Buffalo, Oshaga, Armstrong, and four others {{set out from}} La Pointe for Washington, D.C. by birch bark canoe. Along the way, they stopped in towns and mining camps along the Michigan shore of Lake Superior, {{securing}} hundreds of signatures in support of their cause. At Sault Ste. Marie, they were held by the US Indian agent, who told them that no unauthorized Ojibwa delegations could go to Washington and they had <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back.</b> <b>The</b> men pleaded the urgency of their case and traveled to Detroit by steamship. There another Indian agent tried to stop them. Once allowed to proceed, they sailed through Lake Erie to Buffalo, New York {{and then on to}} Albany and New York City.|$|E
25|$|Thus began Australia's {{involvement}} in the six-year global conflict. Australians were to fight in an extraordinary variety of locations, from withstanding the advance of Hitler's Panzers in the Siege of Tobruk; <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> advance of the Imperial Japanese Army in the New Guinea Campaign. From bomber missions over Europe and Mediterranean naval engagements, to facing Japanese mini-sub raids on Sydney Harbour and devastating air raids on the city of Darwin.|$|R

5|$|In {{the poem}} Gawain, when the Knight is beheaded, he tells Gawain {{to meet him}} at the Green Chapel, saying that all nearby know where it is. Indeed, the guide which is to bring Gawain there from Bertilak's castle grows very fearful as they near it and begs Gawain <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back.</b> <b>The</b> final meeting at the Green Chapel has caused many {{scholars}} to draw religious connections, with the Knight fulfilling a priestly role with Gawain as a penitent. The Green Knight ultimately, in this interpretation, judges Gawain to be a worthy knight, and lets him live, playing a priest, God, and judge all at once.|$|E
5|$|By dawn of 26 August, {{advancing}} west {{along the}} coast with armoured support, the Japanese had reached the main position manned by troops from B Company, 61st Infantry Battalion, around KB Mission. The Japanese force moved through the jungle {{at the edge of}} the coastal track, and was headed by two light tanks. Although they lacked anti-armour weapons, the Australians were able <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> Japanese attack. At this stage, the Japanese suffered a serious setback when their base area was heavily attacked at daylight by RAAF Kittyhawks and a Hudson aircraft, along with B-25s, B-26s and B-17s from the US Fifth Air Force. As a result of the attack, a number of Japanese troops were killed, while a large quantity of supplies was destroyed, as were a number of the landing barges which were beached near the KB Mission. Aside from severely hampering the Japanese supply system, the destruction of the landing barges also prevented their use to outflank the Australian battalions. The Japanese did not have any air cover as the fighters based at Buna which were to patrol over Milne Bay were shot down by Allied fighters shortly after they took off and other aircraft based at Rabaul were forced to turn back due to bad weather.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} to Singapore the 8th Division was deployed {{to defend the}} island's north-west coast. Due to the casualties suffered in Johore most of the division's units were at half-strength. The commander of the Singapore fortress, Lieutenant General Arthur Ernest Percival, believed that the Japanese would land on the north-east coast of the island and deployed the near full-strength British 18th Division to defend this sector. The Japanese landing on 8 February {{took part in the}} Australian sector, however, and the 8th Division was forced from its positions after just two days of heavy fighting. The division was also unable <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> Japanese landing at Kranji and withdrew to the centre of the island. After further fighting in which the Commonwealth forces were pushed into a narrow perimeter around the urban area of Singapore, Percival surrendered his forces on 15 February. Following the surrender 14,972Australians were taken prisoner, though some escaped on ships. These escapees included Major General Bennett, who was found by two post-war inquiries to have been unjustified in leaving his command. The loss of almost a quarter of Australia's overseas soldiers, and the failure of the Singapore Strategy that had permitted it to accept the sending of the AIF to aid Britain, stunned the country.|$|E

Despite enemy rifle fire which cut up the gun carriage and severed the rammer, Laffey bravely stood by his gun and contributed greatly <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> fierce Confederate assault. Seaman Laffey received the Medal of Honor for his actions. Two of his shipmates, Seaman James Stoddard and Seaman William J. Franks, were also awarded the medal for being on the gun crew.|$|R
5|$|Hulagu died in 1265, and was {{succeeded by}} Abaqa (1234–1282), who further pursued Western cooperation. Though a Buddhist, upon his {{succession}} he married Maria Palaiologina, an Orthodox Christian and the illegitimate {{daughter of the}} Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos. Abaqa corresponded with Pope Clement IV through 1267 and 1268, sending envoys to both Clement and King James I of Aragon. In a 1268 message to Clement, Abaqa promised to send troops to aid the Christians. It is unclear if this was what led to James's unsuccessful expedition to Acre in 1269. James initiated a small crusade, but a storm descended on his fleet as they attempted their crossing, forcing most of the ships <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back.</b> <b>The</b> crusade was ultimately handled by James's two sons Fernando Sanchez and Pedro Fernandez, who arrived in Acre in December 1269. Abaqa, despite his earlier promises of assistance, {{was in the process}} of facing another threat, an invasion in Khorasan by Mongols from Turkestan, and so could only commit a small force for the Holy Land, which did little but brandish the threat of an invasion along the Syrian frontier in October 1269. He raided as far as Harim and Afamiyaa in October, but retreated as soon as Baibars' forces advanced.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 25/26 August 1942 about 2,000 Japanese marines with tank support carried out an amphibious landing north of Milne Bay. As the Japanese {{advanced}} towards the 7th Brigade's main defensive position from their beachhead around Waga Waga, the 61st Battalion bore {{the brunt of the}} initial assault and temporarily halted the Japanese advance with an ambush before launching a counterattack against them. The following morning, however, after the 2/10th Battalion had come under attack from Japanese armour, the 61st Battalion was also forced back towards the No. 3 airstrip, where they formed a defensive line against the main Japanese thrust which came on 31 August. With strong artillery support, the 61st and 25th Battalions managed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> Japanese attack, inflicting heavy casualties and in the process seizing the initiative. Following this, elements of the 18th Brigade advanced towards the Japanese beachhead, which they subsequently captured on 6 September, inflicting upon the Japanese their first defeat in a major battle on land during the war.|$|E
5|$|While General Ngô Quang Trưởng {{was still}} busy reorganising South Vietnamese units in I Corps, on March 20 the Tri Thien Command {{finalised}} their plan to capture Huế, {{with the objective}} of preventing South Vietnamese forces from regrouping there. At 2:30pm on the same day, President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu phoned the ARVN 1st Brigade Headquarters, and ordered General Trưởng to defend only Da Nang {{due to the lack of}} resources. Beginning at 5:40am on March 21, the VPA 325th and 324th Divisions attacked South Vietnamese units positioned astride Highway 1. At the same time, elements of the K5 Special Forces Battalion destroyed Thua Luu Bridge, which connected a stretch of road on Highway 1 between Huế and Da Nang, forcing thousands of South Vietnamese civilian and military vehicles heading towards Da Nang <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back.</b> <b>The</b> ARVN 20th Tank Squadron was then sent out to reopen Highway 1, but was defeated by the VPA 203rd Armoured Regiment.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{invasions of}} the Balkans, {{a large part}} of the Eighth Army was {{deployed}} to Greece in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> German advance. Layforce was not sent, although its three infantry assault ships brought with them from the United Kingdom and which were invaluable in carrying out amphibious operations, were taken from them due to a lack of resources in the theatre. This robbed the commandos of one of their most important capabilities and although later the Glengyle was released to Laycock's force, the other two ships were not, which severely constrained the forces that he could deploy. The British loss of air superiority severely hampered their ability to carry out landing operations, while the deployment of forces to Greece meant that the commandos became the only troops in general reserve and as the strategic situation worsened it became increasingly difficult to employ them in the manner for which it had been intended as they were called upon to reinforce the rest of the army elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1916 the {{decision}} was made to transfer elements of the AIF to Europe to take part in the fighting in the trenches along the Western Front. Following their arrival in France in July, the 14th Battalion's first major engagement came in August 1916 when they were committed to the fighting around at Pozières. Over the course of next two and a half years, it was involved in a number of other battles. During April 1917, it took part in the fighting around Bullecourt. In early 1918, they undertook a defensive role, helping <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> German Spring Offensive before taking part in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, which was launched around Amiens on 8 August 1918. At Amiens, the battalion advanced in the centre of the brigade along the Hamel–Cerisy road amid a blanket of fog, and seized the village of Morcourt in the second phase of the attack along the Australian front. Following the initial attack, the battalion continued further operations as part of the Allied advance. Its final engagement came in late September and early the following month, the units of the Australian Corps were withdrawn from the line and were subsequently in the rear when the Armistice occurred on 11 November 1918.|$|E

25|$|The KKK was {{a secret}} organization; apart from a few top leaders, most members never {{identified}} as such and wore masks in public. Investigators in the 1920s used KKK publicity, court cases, exposés by disgruntled Klansman, newspaper reports, and speculation to write stories about what the Klan was doing. Almost all the major national newspapers and magazines were hostile to its activities. The historian Thomas R. Pegram says that published accounts exaggerated the official viewpoint of the Klan leadership, and repeated the interpretations of hostile newspapers and the Klan's enemies. There was almost no evidence in that time regarding the behavior or beliefs of individual Klansmen. According to Pegram, the resulting popular and scholarly interpretation of the Klan from the 1920s into the mid-20th century, emphasized its Southern roots and the violent vigilante-style actions of the Klan in its efforts <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> clock of modernity. Scholars compared it to fascism, which in the 1920s rose as a movement in Italy and in the 1930s in Germany. In the years before the Second World War, the German American Bund, an organization of Americans of German ancestry which sympathized with and propagandized for Nazi Germany in the United States, held a joint rally with the Ku Klux Klan at Camp Nordland in New Jersey on 18 August 1940, with the rally being organized by Alton Milford Young and Arthur Hornbui Bell. Camp Nordland was a 204-acre resort facility in Andover Township, New Jersey, owned and operated from 1937 to 1941 by the German American Bund.|$|E
