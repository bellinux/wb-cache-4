5|$|Although {{his career}} was over, Rotheram {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>request</b> sea service and honours from the Admiralty, becoming increasingly irate and intemperate in his demands. At the reorganising of the knightly orders in 1815, a number of senior naval officers were given knighthoods, but Rotheram was only made a Companion of the Order of the Bath, a step below knighthood. He retired to Bildeston in Suffolk and from there continued <b>to</b> <b>request</b> appointments, finally being made one of the captains of the Greenwich Naval Hospital in 1828. Rotheram died at Bildeston in 1830 and {{was buried in the}} churchyard of St Mary Magdelene just outside the village, where his grave and a memorial plaque are still legible today. Rotheram was never awarded any further honours or promoted to admiral, having lost his seniority in the court martial of 1808.|$|E
