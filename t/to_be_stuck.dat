5|$|Following the war, one {{important}} research avenue {{was trying to}} increase the design bandwidth of wide-band filters. The approach used at the time (and still in use today) was {{to start with a}} lumped element prototype filter and through various transformations arrive at the desired filter in a distributed element form. This approach appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> at a minimum Q of five (see Band-pass filters below for an explanation of Q). In 1957, Leo Young at Stanford Research Institute published a method for designing filters which started with a distributed element prototype. This prototype was based on quarter wave impedance transformers and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an octave, corresponding to a Q of about 1.3. Some of Young's procedures in that paper were empirical, but later, exact solutions were published. Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators, but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types, such as those found in modern planar technologies and illustrated in this article. The capacitive gap filter (figure 8) and the parallel-coupled lines filter (figure 9) are examples of directly coupled resonators.|$|E

In the past, Marek and his team are thrust into a world that is one large battlefield between the French and the English. The French are not happy that the English are continuously attempting to conquer their lands. For this reason, {{there is a great deal}} of fighting between the two sides. Of particular interest in this novel is the greed of Sir Oliver in taking Castelgard and La Roque, and Arnaut’s greed in wanting to take it back. This causes Marek and his team <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> in the middle of two battling hotheads.|$|E

25|$|Analysis of {{the engines}} found that their fuel systems were {{contaminated}} with spherical particles. The particles had caused the Fuel Metering Units' Main Metering Valves (MMVs) to seize; the MMVs were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> in positions corresponding to the recorded thrust output of each engine as it approached Hong Kong. Other engine components {{were found to be}} contaminated with the particles as well, and No. 2 engine's Variable Stator Vane Controller was also found to be seized; the entire fuel system including the aircraft's fuel tanks was found to be contaminated with the spherical particles. As part of the investigation, fuel samples had been collected at Juanda International Airport. Investigators found that the contaminant particles were present in the fuel samples. The fuel supply pipeline system used to refuel aircraft at Juanda International Airport had been extended prior to B-HLL being refuelled there, as part of the construction of new aircraft parking bays. The investigation discovered that not all procedures were followed when the fuel pipeline system was brought back into service.|$|E

Ray Richmond of the Los Angeles Daily News praised NBC for giving Homicide a second chance, comparing it to the days when NBC stuck with the comedy series Cheers even though it ranked last in the ratings during its first season. Richmond said of Homicide: [...] "This {{is also one of the}} final opportunities to see a television network stick with a struggling show for no better reason than it deserves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> with.

500|$|According to Pokémon co-creator Ryan Long, {{the games}} were {{designed}} with the DS's unique features in mind, such as the Wi-Fi capabilities and slot for Game Boy Advance cartridges. The command buttons in the battle screen are large and color-coded; according to Masuda, this feature would facilitate gameplay for players unable to read. Also, the touchscreen interface was designed to encourage players to use their fingers rather than the stylus to manipulate the screen. Though most of the graphics in Diamond and Pearl are 2D, some of the background elements are 3D. The decision to retain 2D graphics in Diamond and Pearl drew criticism; in response, Tsunekazu Ishihara said that [...] "we wanted to maintain the original idea of Pokémon being a game that you played on this big map" [...] and explained that physically, {{the games were}} in three dimensions but was designed to [...] "maintain the original feel of the game". Responding to criticism {{over the use of}} Friend Codes in the games, Ishihara explained that it was a security measure taken to ensure that players {{would not be able to}} chat with strangers over the Wi-Fi connection.

Shawn Kitchener of Entertainment Wise described the song as [...] "the kind of sweet-as-candy R fodder" [...] that could have been featured on the High School Musical soundtrack. Meena Rupani of DesiHits noted that the song's lyrical theme is similar to [...] "It Girl", and that Derulo's [...] "vocals are enough to put any girl into a trance". However, [...] "Fight for You" [...] also received unfavorable reviews from critics because of its lack of originality. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song a three out of five star rating, calling Derulo [...] "extremely lazy" [...] for sampling [...] "Africa". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian described the song as [...] "languid", while writing that the sample gives it [...] "a bit of bounce". Although Jess Holton of The Music Network described [...] "Fight for You" [...] as a [...] "touching ballad", she added that sampling [...] "Africa" [...] does not do the latter [...] "any form of justice". In an album review of Future History, Michael Cragg of BBC Music noted that the songs [...] "revolve around the joys of being in a relationship or the pain of not being in one", however disapproved of the lyrical content and sample in [...] "Fight for You", calling it [...] "perhaps the worst offender" [...] on the album.|$|E

Chris Colfer has been in the running for performance awards for good reason. Darren Criss will not be.
