Upon checking out, the deposit is automatically refunded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> <b>with</b> {{the price of the}} journey deducted. The journey price consists of a basic fare and a fare-per-kilometer. The basic fare is only calculated once per journey, which means that only the per-kilometer fare is calculated after transferring to another vehicle (provided that no more than 35 minutes have passed between checking out and in). Journey fares vary regionally and are determined periodically by regional transport boards.|$|E
50|$|The {{main event}} saw Shane McMahon as the ring announcer, announcing more changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> <b>with</b> Pat Patterson as the guest time keeper, Gerald Brisco as the special guest referee and Big Boss Man changed to {{enforcer}} alongside Vinnie Jones. After a brawl {{between the two}} enforcers, Brisco gave Jones a red card and had him ejected. The four-way match began prematurely with Mankind and Kane brawling before The Undertaker arrived, who chokeslammed Mankind and threw him outside before throwing Kane out too. Steve Austin then made his entrance but was met on the walkway by Undertaker while Mankind and Kane continued {{to fight in the}} middle of the ring, Mankind being taken down with a flying lariat. After dealing with Undertaker, Austin then took Mankind around the ring smashing head into the announce table and crowd barrier. Austin and Undertaker continued to fight inside the ring, Austin using his vest to choke his opponent but was taken down with a flying clothesline and leg drop. Kane, meanwhile, was being beaten by Mankind outside the ring and had his head thrown into a television monitor. In the ring Austin recovered from Undertaker's dominance with a Lou Thesz Press but Kane broke up the pin count. Kane then fought Austin as Undertaker dealt with Mankind. Undertaker used some cable to choke Mankind, then Kane came up behind and choked Undertaker with cable before finally Austin used some cable to choke Kane as Mankind escaped and used a microphone to the head of Undertaker and Kane. Eventually the four wrestlers came back into the ring with Kane choking Undertaker into the corner until Austin turned his attention to Kane. Undertaker did not thank him for it, though, instead trying to walk the rope for Old School but his balance was thrown when Mankind threw Kane against the ropes. Austin and Mankind briefly teamed up against Kane, then Mankind offered his hand in alliance but Austin replied with a finger. Mankind replied with a mandible claw until Undertaker pulled him off his feet and wedged his crotch into the ring post from outside the ring. Kane and Undertaker then teamed up on Austin but while nobody was looking Mankind donned Mr Socko, kicking Austin and then high-fiving the referee. Mankind then brought a steel chair into the ring, hitting Kane but receiving a shot by Undertaker. As Undertaker tried to pin him, Austin hit him on the back with a chairshot and was met with a slow count from Brisco. With the ring cleared, Kane tried to chokeslam Austin but was kicked in the crotch and received a stunner. Again Brisco tried to avoid the count by checking the time on the outside. An enraged Austin kicked Brisco out of the ring meaning Earl Hebner had to run to ringside when Undertaker chokeslammed both Kane and Austin. When the count was broken up by Mankind, Undertaker fought with him on the outside of the ring during which time Austin stunnered Kane and covered him to win the match. When Brisco attacked Hebner, Austin also gave him a stunner. Vinnie Jones then came down to the ring and kicked Boss Man to allow Austin to deliver another stunner before Hebner kicked him out of the ring, using an Austin like taunt.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 42) A {{speech synthesizer}} {{was designed and}} programmed {{to be used in}} conjunction with an APPLE II computer. Speech was made possible with a Voice Synthesis Processor (VSP) integrated circuit from Texas Instruments. The circuit reduces the sound of a spoken word to a block of coded data using a technique called ???linear predictive coding. ??? The sound of a word was generated by transferring the data to the VSP, which decodes the data and provides an analog speech output. The circuit was built on a card which plugs into any of the peripheral connector slots l through 7 inside the APPLE chassis. An 8 -ohm speaker was used to reproduce the sound of spoken words, and connects <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> <b>with</b> a two-wire cable. Synthesized speech adds a new dimension to human-interactive computer programs. The intent of the project was to make it easy to incorporate speech into existing or new BASIC programs. The speech data is loaded into the top of RAM memory, {{out of the way of}} user programs. The assembly language program which controls the VSP is located in an EPROM on the speech card. All the user has to add to a BASIC program are two short subroutines that provide the transition to the assembly program...|$|E
