25|$|One day for {{the march}} I {{received}} this heavy old gun. A gun? And during a war? Never, I thought <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> <b>And</b> leaned it against a hut. And walked away. But that stood out even in our group at that time. I don't know now how I got away with it, but somehow it worked. And so I got by unarmed.|$|E
25|$|But {{perhaps my}} finest memory of this lordly Frenchman came in 1966 at the Nürburgring, where a German {{official}} had been particularly rude <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> other English journalists about going through one gate (the exit) {{to the press}} room instead of another 100 yards away (the entrance). We sat in delight, Sid Saltmarsh, Bill Long and me, not 20 yards from that 'Exit' gate, and watched as Jacques pulled up in his Ford Mustang, and proceeded to unload his bike {{from the back of}} the car. Yes, he did, not leaving it to mechanics. German official railed and cried, but all in vain. The seigniorial aspect came out oh so clearly, and Jacques did not merely ignore him, it was palpably as if the German did not exist at all. He left the car there, walked over to the riders' quarters pushing the gate open and the German with it. It has probably the finest comeuppance I shall ever see, and for that I shall remember Jacques for a long time.|$|E

500|$|... "I'm Eighteen" [...] comes {{between two}} {{straight-ahead}} rockers: [...] "Long Way to Go" [...] and album opener [...] "Caught in a Dream". [...] Both follow simple hard-rock , trading heavy riffing with guitar fills and solos. [...] The album title derives from lyrics in [...] "Long Way to Go". [...] "Caught in a Dream" [...] was the album's second single and features irreverent, tongue-in-cheek lyrics such as [...] "I need everything the world owes me/ I tell that <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> I agree". [...] The first side closes with [...] "Black Juju" [...] by bassist Dunaway, a lengthy {{track in the}} vein of The Doors, and Pink Floyd's [...] "Interstellar Overdrive"—both bands Alice Cooper earlier had opened for—with an organ part derived from Pink Floyd's [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun".

500|$|In March 2009, {{speculation}} arose that Walton {{had taken}} a medical leave; however, Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada reported {{that she had been}} asked to accept a salary cut and had decided to leave. The soap opera issued a casting call for Jill, describing her as [...] "late '50s, Caucasian, female. This [...] woman is a smart and confident CEO of a successful company. She is a mother and grandmother who wants what is best for her family." [...] However, soon after, Walton was able to sign a new contract to continue her portrayal of Jill. She later clarified her departure as having to do with [...] "family and this economy". She stated: [...] "I felt so bad that so many people have lost their jobs, that, all of a sudden, I thought: 'This is really silly. I have a wonderful job and I really think I owe it <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> my family to continue on.'" [...] In February 2012, Walton signed a new contract with the soap opera, which would continue her portrayal of the role for an unspecified amount of time. The actress was then announced to be taking a leave of absence beginning that April, slated to last six months. [...] She made her return on November 2, 2012. After her return, Walton confirmed in an interview with Soap Opera Digest that she had voluntarily dropped to recurring status to allow for more time with her family.|$|E

Mervyn Watson, former executive producer of Casualty, has commented on the origins of the idea to fully cross the two shows over for the first time: [...] "I think the idea came from somebody in the comedy department, who casually said to the Controller of Drama 'Wouldn't it be a good idea if...'

He had always shown a great fondness for music, but had never received any technical training in the art. Entirely self-taught, his knowledge was acquired solely by 'picking up' information. [...] "I wish it to be distinctly understood," [...] he said, [...] "that I {{have always been a}} mere amateur in music.

Laura talks of her own struggle to come out; [...] "I came out to my family I would say early to mid 90s.

2500|$|In October 1988, after {{completing}} {{most of the}} recording, Kravitz approached friend Stephen Elvis Smith who had served as the Music Supervisor on Lisa Bonet's spin-off of The Cosby Show, A Different World. Smith had also worked with Kravitz' mother Roxie Roker, on the hit sitcom The Jeffersons. Kravitz urged Smith to manage his career and assist him in finding a record deal. In {{less than a month}} of shopping the recordings, five labels (Warner Bros, Elektra, Geffen, Capitol and Virgin) were in a bidding war for Kravitz. Eventually a deal was made with Virgin Records in January 1989, and signed by Virgin A executive Nancy Jeffries. The label was excited about the music he was making, music inspired by his relationship with wife Bonet and their new daughter, Zoe. On Smith's urging, Kravitz dropped the name Romeo Blue and reclaimed the Lenny Kravitz moniker. About his time as Romeo Blue, Kravitz said, [...] "Ultimately, it got me back <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> <b>And</b> when I finally did accept myself for myself, music started flowing out of me." ...|$|E
