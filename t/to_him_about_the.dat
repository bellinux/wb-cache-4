5|$|Silvestre de Sacy {{eventually}} gave up {{work on the}} stone, but he was to {{make another}} contribution. In 1811, prompted by discussions with a Chinese student about Chinese script, Silvestre de Sacy considered a suggestion made by Georg Zoëga in 1797 that the foreign names in Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions might be written phonetically; he also recalled that as early as 1761, Jean-Jacques Barthélemy had suggested that the characters enclosed in cartouches in hieroglyphic inscriptions were proper names. Thus, when Thomas Young, foreign secretary of the Royal Society of London, wrote <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> stone in 1814, Silvestre de Sacy suggested in reply that in attempting to read the hieroglyphic text, Young might look for cartouches that ought to contain Greek names and try to identify phonetic characters in them.|$|E
25|$|Francis Billingsley {{seems to}} have brought a measure of professionalism to the defence of Bridgnorth. Wolryche, however, seems never to have fully {{reconciled}} himself {{to the demands of}} war. In June he wrote to Capell to denounce a constable of Halesowen, then in Shropshire, who had been insufficiently vigorous in levying taxation, requisitioning and conscripting for the king. Nevertheless, when a relative, Gilbert Warley, protested <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> exactions of a royalist foraging party on his neighbours, Wolryche was quick to write to Ottley, asking for his help in recovering horses stolen in the incident.|$|E

On the way down the mountain, Maruyama accidentally slips and falls off. Paifu makes a daring rescue by learning flight at the last minute and saves Maruyama and himself from immediate death. On the way back, Maruyama talks of how he is going to buy a boat with the money he makes forcing Paifu to reveal that he had lied <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> payment of 1,000,000 yen. Maruyama admits that he is disappointed, but not infuriated as Paifu saved his life. The four are praised as they returned to the village. One month later, Paifu, Jose and everyone else from the village meet Maruyama out at sea with a ghost boat that all fixed up together.|$|E

Jake shot Vic at Jake's home and brought his body to the party, where everyone assumed he was just passed out. Jake paid Bouclier to remain quiet, which is why Bouclier had to kill Professor Jones. Bouclier, Faronea's accomplice, killed Faronea after Tony spoke <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> kidnapping plot. [...] Jake then shot Bouclier.

500|$|Several {{actors were}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Robert Modell, even Lance Henriksen, who went on to play the lead role in Millennium. Initially, Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell, but Robert Wisden read the script and [...] "blew us away". Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden's performance and said, [...] "I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher. He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own. It took me about {{a day and a half}} to get him into it, and then I never had to speak to him again, because he had that look in his eyes.

He showed scant interest at first, but after his brother Reginald wrote in 1948, [...] "Malcolm, don't eat any more pork and don't smoke any more cigarettes. I'll show you {{how to get out of}} prison", he quit smoking and began to refuse pork. After a visit in which Reginald described the group's teachings, including the belief that white people are devils, Little concluded that every relationship he'd had with whites had been tainted by dishonesty, injustice, greed, and hatred. Little, whose hostility to religion had earned him the prison nickname [...] "Satan", became receptive to the message of the Nation of Islam.|$|E

Meanwhile, Behr {{and a friend}} attended a memorabilia show at the Beverly Garland Hotel in North Hollywood, where James Darren was signing autographs. Darren had not wanted to attend the event, but had been convinced otherwise. Behr thought he was so charming {{that he wanted to}} talk <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> role on the spot, but his friend talked him out of it as he felt that Darren would think he was insane. Surma got in touch with Darren at Behr's prompting. Darren initially rejected the role, having heard that the part was a singer. Darren's agent went back to him three times and eventually convinced him to read the script, which is when {{he fell in love with}} the character. He later called it a [...] "dream come true".|$|E
500|$|The role of Frank, the suicidal Proust scholar, was {{originally}} written for Bill Murray, {{and there was}} also studio pressure for Robin Williams. The directing duo chose Steve Carell for the role a few months before filming began, and in an interview revealed: [...] "When we met with Steve Carell, we didn't know he could do this based upon what he had done. But when we met with him and talked <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> character, the tone of the movie and the way we were approaching it, he was right on the same page with us". Although known to Comedy Central viewers for many years as a correspondent on the highly rated satirical news program The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, at the time Carell was cast for Little Miss Sunshine, he was relatively unknown in Hollywood. Producers of the film were worried that he was not a big enough star and did not have much acting experience.|$|E
500|$|The East German {{government}} {{sought to}} defuse the situation by relaxing the country's border controls with effect from 10November 1989; the announcement was made {{on the evening of}} 9November 1989 by Politbüro member Günter Schabowski at a somewhat chaotic press conference in East Berlin, who proclaimed the new control regime as liberating the people from a situation of psychological pressure by legalising and simplifying migration. Misunderstanding the note passed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> decision to open the border, he announced the border would be opened [...] "immediately, without delay", rather than from the following day as the government had intended. Crucially, it was neither meant to be an uncontrolled opening nor to apply to East Germans wishing to visit the West as tourists. At an interview in English after the press conference, Schabowski told the NBC reporter Tom Brokaw that [...] "it is no question of tourism. It is a permission of leaving the GDR [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Indeed, at times, his sarcasm was {{directed}} even at his superiors, with Nansouty clashing {{with the more}} senior Grouchy at the Battle of Friedland. Nevertheless, Grouchy later recognised that the actions of Nansouty's division throughout the battle were [...] "glorious". In 1809, Nansouty famously responded to Napoleon's criticism after the Battle of Wagram by saying: [...] "It is not Your Majesty at any rate who can {{teach me how to}} handle cavalry." [...] Three years later, during the campaign in Russia, when Murat, King of Naples complained <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lack of resistance of the horses, Nansouty retorted: [...] "Oh yes, Sire, this is because they lack patriotism." [...] At the Battle of Craonne, in 1814, one day before resigning, he was recorded to have refused to execute Napoleon's order to assault a redoubt, a move which he saw as a death sentence to his men. Instead, Nansouty told the Emperor: [...] "I am going alone. There is nothing but death there and I will not lead these brave soldiers to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Sestak {{insisted he}} would not make a final {{decision}} for several months. On May 4, he met with Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, which fueled speculation that he was seeking labor support for a campaign. Meanwhile, Joe Torsella, {{the former president of}} the National Constitution Center, had planned on running for the Democratic nomination and initially announced Specter's party change would not affect his decision to run. However, Torsella announced on May 14 he was dropping out of the race because Specter's decision changed the political landscape, and he wanted to avoid a campaign that [...] "would probably be negative, personal, and more about Senator Specter's past than our common future". It had been reported that Governor Rendell, for whom Torsella previously worked as an aide, pushed for Torsella to step aside so Specter could run unopposed, but Torsella's staff denied those claims. Despite Torsella's departure, Sestak continued to consider entering the race and began gaining support from the Democratic party's more liberal factions like the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which began a [...] "Draft Sestak" [...] campaign fund. Sestak became further encouraged to run after taking a tour of all 67 Pennsylvania counties to meet with party leaders and discuss such issues as jobs, the economy and health care. Sestak said that the leaders voiced serious concerns <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> direction of the country and, although his lack of name recognition was a problem, Sestak said many of the people he encountered voiced support for him.|$|E
500|$|After Hershiser reached 49 {{consecutive}} innings {{because of}} what some sources describe as an umpire's favorable interference ruling on a double play, the sports media compared him to Drysdale, who had a similar incident occur during his streak. The Houston Chronicle noted that both beneficial calls were in Dodgers–Giants games. However, the press also noted that Hershiser needed another complete game shutout to tie Drysdale and pass Johnson on the all-time consecutive scoreless innings list. In addition to covering the record pursuit, some sportswriters perceived that Hershiser had taken a commanding lead in the Cy Young Award race. Despite the official ruling by MLB statistician Seymour Siwoff that only full innings of starting pitchers count toward the record, some of the press continued {{to refer to the}} record as [...] innings. The pennant race also continued to draw attention as the Dodgers closed in on the NL West division title. An Associated Press article noted that it was Hershiser's eighth consecutive complete game and fifteenth of the season and Hershiser's fifth consecutive complete game shutout. As Hershiser's last remaining start approached, the media mentioned that he needed one more complete game shutout to tie the all-time record. When the total reached 49, Hershiser first began to feel that the record was within reach. Not only were his teammates too superstitious to talk <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> streak, Dodgers announcer Drysdale also avoided the subject when talking to Hershiser for fear of jinxing him. Hershiser was not superstitious about the record, saying, [...] "I'm pretty loosey-goosey about it... I talk about it all the time. I'm not superstitious." ...|$|E

500|$|Tenar, from whose {{perspective}} The Tombs of Atuan is told, is {{born on the}} Kargish {{island of}} Atuan before being taken away to serve the Nameless Ones as their high priestess. She is told {{that she is the}} reincarnation of the high priestess, and has lived at the tombs since time immemorial; though she believes this early in her life, she begins to question the idea later in the novel. For much of the book she is known only as Arha, or the [...] "Eaten one"; her identity as an individual is gradually erased. Though she is depicted as a person of strength and imagination, her development is stunted by the priestesses; her feelings are repressed, and her mind has no place to wander except the labyrinth. After trapping Ged, she talks <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> rest of Earthsea, and begins to desire a life outside the barrenness of the Tombs. It is only after her escape that she seems to regain her name, crying [...] "I have my name back. I am Tenar!" [...] Tehanu, the fourth Earthsea novel, is narrated from Tenar's point of view; it depicts her life on Gont and her reunion and relationship with Ged. She reappears in The Other Wind, the sixth Earthsea book. Tenar plays the role of a heroine in The Tombs of Atuan, in which she is somewhat stereotypically cast as a [...] "side-kick" [...] to Ged, but later breaks out of this role to become a central character in her own right in Tehanu. Tenar is part of multiple pairs of characters that develop together; both Ged, in The Tombs of Atuan, and later Tehanu in her eponymous novel, are shown as being dependent on her.|$|E
