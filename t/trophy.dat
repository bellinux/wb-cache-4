5|$|After Frank Boucher of the New York Rangers won {{the award}} seven times within eight years, Lady Byng was so {{impressed}} that {{she gave him the}} original <b>trophy</b> to keep. Lady Byng then donated a second <b>trophy</b> in 1935–36. When Lady Byng died in 1949, the NHL presented another <b>trophy</b> and changed the official name to the Lady Byng Memorial <b>Trophy.</b> In 1962, the original <b>trophy</b> was destroyed in a fire at Boucher's home.|$|E
5|$|Although the Larry O'Brien <b>Trophy</b> {{has been}} {{compared}} with the National Hockey League's (NHL) Stanley Cup, {{it has never been}} as prominent as the NHL <b>trophy.</b> To reduce this discrepancy, the NBA has been actively promoting the O'Brien <b>Trophy</b> in recent years to generate more recognition and an iconic status for the <b>trophy.</b> After the Detroit Pistons won the NBA Finals in 2004, the <b>trophy</b> was toured around the state of Michigan, marking the first time the <b>trophy</b> toured around the state of the winning team. In 2005, the NBA Legends Tour was launched in New York City. As part of the tour, the O’Brien <b>Trophy</b> was showcased in various cities—including those that were hosting the playoffs—for fans' autograph and photo sessions. It was escorted by many former players, including Julius Erving, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell. In May 2007, the NBA unveiled the NBA Headquarters on Second Life, an Internet-based virtual reality environment. With this launch, fans could take pictures with the championship <b>trophy</b> in the virtual Toyota Larry O'Brien <b>Trophy</b> Room. In August, the <b>trophy</b> traveled to Hong Kong {{for the first time as}} part of the NBA Madness Asia Tour.|$|E
5|$|India {{has also}} {{played a major role}} in popularising cricket. Thus, cricket is, by far, the most popular sport in India.

5|$|The William Harridge <b>Trophy</b> is the American League's {{counterpart}} to the Giles <b>Trophy,</b> and is presented {{each year to}} the American League champion by honorary league president Frank Robinson.

5|$|A minor {{controversy}} about the <b>trophy</b> occurred in 1984, when Donald Wandrei refused his Life Achievement award {{as he felt}} the award bust was a demeaning caricature of Lovecraft, whom he had known personally.

5|$|A new Commissioner's <b>Trophy</b> {{is created}} each year, {{much like the}} Lombardi <b>Trophy</b> and the O'Brien <b>Trophy.</b> In contrast, hockey's Stanley Cup is passed from {{champion}} to champion. Before 1997, the <b>trophy</b> was presented in the winners locker room. Since then the presentation occurs on the field if the champion clinches the title in their home stadium. Since its inception, the only year that the Commissioner's <b>Trophy</b> has not been awarded was 1994, when the players' strike ended the season on August 11, resulting in the cancellation of the entire post-season. The New York Yankees have won the most Commissioner's Trophies, winning seven World Series since 1967. The St. Louis Cardinals have won four trophies, a National League record.|$|E
5|$|A new <b>trophy</b> {{design was}} created for the 1977 NBA Finals, {{although}} it retained the Walter A. Brown title. Unlike the original championship <b>trophy,</b> the new <b>trophy</b> was given permanently to the winning team and a new one was made every year.|$|E
5|$|A superstition that is {{prevalent}} among many of today's NHL players {{is that no}} player should either touch or hoist the Wales (Eastern Conference champion) or Clarence S. Campbell (Western Conference champion) Trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; these players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship <b>trophy</b> and thus {{it should be the}} only <b>trophy</b> that they should be hoisting. Instead of touching the conference <b>trophy,</b> the captain of the winning team merely poses (usually looking solemn) with the <b>trophy,</b> and sometimes, the entire team poses as well. However, there have been other teams who have ignored the superstition and hoisted the conference trophies, sometimes going on to win the Cup anyway.|$|E

The remaining 3 series were drawn, with West Indies retaining the Wisden <b>Trophy</b> on each occasion (1973–74, 1991 and 1995). In the series' 44-year history the Wisden <b>Trophy</b> has changed hands on five occasions (1968, 1973, 2000 and twice in 2009) with England regaining the <b>trophy</b> in 1968, 2000 and May 2009, while the West Indies regained it in 1973 and April 2009.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} superstition that is {{prevalent among}} many of today's NHL players {{is that no}} player should either touch or hoist the Campbell (Western Conference champion) or Prince of Wales (Eastern Conference champion) trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; these players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship <b>trophy</b> and thus {{it should be the}} only <b>trophy</b> that they should be hoisting.

5|$|As a {{security}} measure, The Football Association secretly manufactured {{a replica of}} the <b>trophy</b> for use in exhibitions rather than the original. This replica was used on subsequent occasions up until 1970 when the original <b>trophy</b> had to be handed back to FIFA. Since FIFA had explicitly denied the FA permission to create a replica, the replica also had to disappear from public view and was for many years kept under its creator's bed. This replica was eventually sold at an auction in 1997 for £254,500, when it was purchased by FIFA. The high auction price, ten times the reserve price of £20,000–£30,000, was led by speculation that the auctioned <b>trophy</b> was not the replica <b>trophy</b> but the original itself. Subsequent testing by FIFA, however, confirmed the auctioned <b>trophy</b> was indeed a replica and FIFA soon afterwards arranged for the replica to be lent for display at the English National Football Museum, which was then based in Preston but is now in Manchester.|$|E
