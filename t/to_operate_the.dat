5|$|For {{security}} reasons, Groves wanted H. K.

Operating personnel for the new plant were initially trained at the Philadelphia pilot plant. In August 1944, Groves, Conant and Fox asked ten enlisted men of the Special Engineer Detachment (SED) at Oak Ridge for volunteers, warning that the job would be dangerous. All ten volunteered. Along with four Fercleve employees, they were sent to Philadelphia to learn about the plant's operation.|$|E

5|$|The {{advance to}} the Blackett design {{was the way the}} {{sighting}} head was aimed. Instead of dialling the parameters into the sight directly as in the CSBS, these inputs were dialled into a separate console. The console was equipped with repeaters for each of the aircraft instruments needed <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>the</b> sight, like altitude and airspeed. The operator simply turned the dials on the console so their indicator arrows matched the readings on the instruments displayed in the same location, known as laying needle on needle. This eliminated the possibility that the numbers would not be changed as the bomber manoeuvred, but required so much manual working that a new crew member was introduced <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>the</b> console, the bomb-aimer's mate.|$|E
5|$|The twin {{areas are}} located at Storhamar, a {{residential}} area {{west of the}} town center of Hamar.

The venue {{is owned by the}} municipally owned entity called Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, which also owns and operates Vikingskipet. The operating deficits are covered by a post-Olympic capital fund, which {{in the case of the}} two Hamar venues was NOK60 million. Only the interest of these funds is used <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>the</b> facilities, unlike Lillehammer and Gjøvik which also derive fundings from their base capital.
