Maize, mixed beans, rice, sorghum, soya beans, sunflower, sweet potatoes and wheat were the major crops in the provinces. Among all provinces, Central had <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>area,</b> , constituting 20.64 per cent, while Luapula had the smallest area at 3.06 per cent of the total area. Maize production was maximum in Eastern (22.5%), mixed beans (51.66%) in Northern, sorghum in Southern (40.62%), sunflower in Eastern (70.2%), soya beans (45.06%), sweet potatoes (28.5%) and wheat (49.51%) in Central Province.|$|E

2500|$|Matthew Stout gives many {{examples}} of why the people who built these structures chose a circular formation. [...] First of all, they had strategic advantages. Circular sites allowed for a broad perspective of the surrounding area and allowed <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>area</b> to be enclosed relative to the bank constructed. He also comes up with some much more metaphysical theories. He suggests that a circular formation linked the site and its occupants with the circular burial mounds of their ancestors. About {{a third of all}} Irish hillforts have mounds or cairns within them. [...] The Aileach is no exception. He also puts forward the idea that a circular form was favoured because corners could act as a dwelling-place of evil spirits. He bases these claims on ethnographic comparisons.|$|E

And taking this assumption as sound, we can state precisely <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>area</b> of various types of town. A pedestrian agglomeration such as we find in China, and such as most of the European towns probably were before the nineteenth century, would be swept entirely by a radius of four miles about the business quarter and industrial centre; and, under these circumstances, where the area of the feeding regions has been very large the massing of human beings has probably reached its extreme limit.[16] Of course, {{in the case of a}} navigable river, for example, the commercial centre might be elongated into a line and the circle of the city modified into an ellipse with a long diameter considerably exceeding eight miles, as, for example, in the case of Hankow.|$|E
