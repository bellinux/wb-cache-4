Charles Abramson's group at Oklahoma State University has put inebriated bees on running wheels, where they exhibit locomotion difficulties. They also put honey bees in shuttle-boxes that used a stimulus to encourage the bees to move, and found that they were less mobile as they became more intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|After the {{six years}} of absolutism that {{followed}} Ferdinand's return to the throne on 1 January 1820, Rafael del Riego initiated an army revolt {{with the intent of}} restoring the 1812 Constitution. By March, the king was forced to agree, but by September 1823, after an unstable period, a French invasion supported by an alliance of the major powers had removed the constitutional government. The last prints were probably not completed until after the Constitution was restored, though certainly before Goya left Spain in May 1824. <b>Their</b> <b>balance</b> of optimism and cynicism makes it difficult to relate them directly to particular moments in these rapidly moving events.|$|E
5|$|For many net oil {{importing}} {{countries the}} 2000s energy crisis brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis. For the United States, the other developed countries and emerging countries {{their dependence on}} foreign oil has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price shocks and supply disruption. Also, there have been concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the higher cost of extracting unconventional oil. A third issue that has been raised is the threat to national security because most proven oil reserves are concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests. In addition, for many developing countries, and particularly for the poorest African countries, high oil prices have an adverse impact on the government budget and deteriorate their terms of trade thus jeopardizing <b>their</b> <b>balance</b> of payments, all leading to lower economic growth.|$|E

25|$|For example, suppose someone {{deposits}} $100 with a {{bank for}} 1 year, and they receive interest of $10 (before tax), {{so at the}} end of the year, <b>their</b> <b>balance</b> is $110 (before tax).

25|$|Thus, one {{incentive}} for banks to create securitized assets {{is to remove}} risky assets from <b>their</b> <b>balance</b> sheet by having another institution assume the credit risk, so that they (the banks) receive cash in return.

25|$|The cursorial {{theory of}} the origin of flight was first {{proposed}} by Samuel Wendell Williston, and elaborated upon by Baron Nopcsa. This hypothesis proposes that some fast-running animals with long tails used their arms to keep <b>their</b> <b>balance</b> while running. Modern versions of this theory differ in many details from the Williston-Nopcsa version, mainly as a result of discoveries since Nopcsa's time.|$|E
25|$|The Duncan-class battleships {{were ordered}} in {{response}} to large French and Russian building programmes, including an emphasis on fast battleships in the Russian programme; they were designed as smaller, more lightly armoured, and faster versions of the preceding Formidable class. As it turned out, the Russian ships were not as heavily armed as initially feared, and the Duncans proved to be quite superior in <b>their</b> <b>balance</b> of speed, firepower, and protection. Although they were designed before the ships of the London subclass of the Formidable class, the first two Londons were laid down before the first Duncan.|$|E

25|$|Nopcsa {{theorized that}} {{increasing}} {{the surface area}} of the outstretched arms could have helped small cursorial predators keep <b>their</b> <b>balance,</b> and that the scales of the forearms elongated, evolving into feathers. The feathers could also {{have been used to}} trap insects or other prey. Progressively, the animals leapt for longer distances, helped by their evolving wings. Nopcsa also proposed three stages in the evolution of flight. First, animals developed passive flight, in which developing wing structures served as a sort of parachute. Second, they achieved active flight by flapping the wings. He used Archaeopteryx as an example of this second stage. Finally, birds gained the ability to soar.|$|E
25|$|Snow leopards show several adaptations {{for living}} in a cold, mountainous environment. Their bodies are stocky, their fur is thick, and their ears are small and rounded, all of which help to {{minimize}} heat loss. Their paws are wide, which distributes their weight better for walking on snow, and have fur on their undersides to increase their grip on steep and unstable surfaces; it also helps to minimize heat loss. Snow leopards' tails are long and flexible, helping them to maintain <b>their</b> <b>balance,</b> which {{is very important in}} the rocky terrain they inhabit. Their tails are also very thick due to fat storage and are very thickly covered with fur, which allows them to be used like a blanket to protect their faces when asleep.|$|E
25|$|When falling, skiers in {{this class}} with above the knee amputations are taught {{to try to prevent}} the stump of their leg from hitting the snow as it can cause more damage to that leg than the one that is not {{partially}} missing. When working on side stepping, the skier is supported to keep the stump of their leg on the uphill side. Elite skiers are taught to avoid using outriggers as crutches. Skiers are taught to turn using their leg instead of their ski poles. Skiers {{in this class}} can use the outrigger to assist in maintaining <b>their</b> <b>balance</b> as they turn on the hill. A skier with an above the knee amputation may have a better ability to complete turns on the opposite of their amputation. In getting on ski lifts, skiers with above the knee amputations in this classification should lift their outriggers off the ground and point them forward.|$|E

25|$|In {{an angry}} {{response}} to Smoot–Hawley, Canada welcomed the British introduction of trade protectionism {{and a system}} of Commonwealth preference {{during the winter of}} 1931-32. It helped Canada avoid external default on their public debt during the Great Depression. Canada had a high degree of exposure to the international economy, which left Canada susceptible to any international economic downturn. The onset of the depression created critical balance of payment deficits, and it was largely the extension of imperial protection by Britain that gave Canada the opportunity to increase their exports to the British market. By 1938 Britain was importing more than twice the 1929 volume of products from Australia, while the value of products shipped from Canada more than doubled, despite the dramatic drop in prices. Thus, the British market played a vital role in helping Canada and Australia stabilize <b>their</b> <b>balance</b> of payments in the immensely difficult economic conditions of the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that people who commit sins go to Hell {{and have to go}} through punishments in accordance with the sins they committed. The god Yamarāja, who is also the god of death, presides over Hell. Detailed accounts of all the sins committed by an individual are kept by Chitragupta, who is the record keeper in Yama's court. Chitragupta reads out the sins committed and Yama orders appropriate punishments to be given to individuals. These punishments include dipping in boiling oil, burning in fire, torture using various weapons, etc. in various Hells. Individuals who finish their quota of the punishments are reborn in accordance with <b>their</b> <b>balance</b> of karma. All created beings are imperfect and thus have at least one sin to their record; but if one has generally led a pious life, one ascends to svarga, a temporary realm of enjoyment similar to Paradise, after a brief period of expiation in Hell and before the next reincarnation, according to the law of karma.|$|E
