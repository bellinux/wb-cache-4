40|$|Abstract—Moving object {{extraction}} plays a {{key role}} in applications such as object-based videoconference, surveillance, and so on. The difficulties of moving object segmentation lie in the fact that physical objects are normally not homogeneous with respect to low-level features and it’s usually <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> segment <b>them</b> accurately and efficiently. Object segmentation based on prestored background information has proved to be effective and efficient in several applications such as videophone, video conferencing, and surveillance, etc. The previous works, however, were mainly concentrated on object segmentation with a static camera and in a stationary background. In this paper, we propose a robust and fast segmentation algorithm and a reliable tracking strategy without knowing the shape of the object in advance. The proposed system can real-time extract the foreground from the background and track the moving object with an active (pan-tilt) camera such that the moving object always stays around the center of images. Keywords—object segmentation; object tracking; image mosaics; virtual meeting I...|$|R

5000|$|Usually, {{right-handed}} batters hit better against left-handed {{pitchers and}} vice versa. Most curveballs {{break away from}} batters hitting from the same side as the opposing pitcher, making <b>them</b> harder <b>to</b> hit with the barrel (or [...] "sweet spot") of the bat. Additionally, the pitcher's release is farther from the batter's center of vision. In switch-pitcher Pat Venditte's words, [...] "If I'm pitching right-handed and they're hitting right-handed, it's <b>tougher</b> for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> see.

[...] It was challenging to cast Yiddish-speaking actors in Montreal, but in New York several people pointed Giroux to Luzer Twersky, who they said would be interested.The producers recommended Hadas Yaron, but as she did not speak French or Yiddish, she had to study both languages, working on Yiddish with Twesky and French in Israel.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{after the}} 1989 logging ban many mahouts were also left without jobs, many also {{contribute}} their elephants to {{the tourism industry}} by using <b>them</b> <b>to</b> beg in the cities.

This results in a minimum of 15 elephants being injured in traffic accidents per month. Since many of these elephants are separated from their mothers too young, their skin is not <b>tough</b> enough <b>to</b> protect <b>them</b> from the sun, their feet are not developed enough to work all day, and they {{do not have access to}} their mother's milk and are therefore malnourished. Furthermore, since they are exposed to gas from traffic for around 12 hours a day, they develop damage to their respiratory systems. The noise from this traffic can also damage their hearing.|$|R

We developed a more realistic vegetation growth model and studied the relationship between consumption and growth.

(They were 2-1 in games decided by eight points, but in 1991 that didn't count as a touchdown or less {{because there was no}} two-point conversion.) They didn't have particularly bad luck on fumbles, and their schedule was ninth difficult in the league, so it wasn't all about opponent strength. They just kept losing close games. Part of San Diego's problem was a significantly unbalanced offense, which ranked second in rushing efficiency and 19th in passing efficiency. That made it <b>tough</b> for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> come back from a deficit, and they just happened to end up with more fourth-quarter deficits that needed erasing than fourth-quarter leads that needed protecting." ...|$|R
