25|$|The Windsor Report was criticised by liberals (for example, in The Windsor Report: A Liberal Response) for seeming <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> {{that the}} actions of New Hampshire and New Westminster—and {{homosexuality}} in general—were wrong. For example, while it calls for both conservatives and liberals to apologise for disunity, it acknowledges that the conservatives may have acted {{out of a sense}} of duty. However, it concedes no such acknowledgement to New Westminster and New Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|To {{believe in}} God means to accept {{life on the}} {{assumption}} that it harbors conditions in the outer world and drives in the human spirit which together impel man to transcend himself. To believe in God means <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society. In brief, God is the Power in the cosmos that gives human life the direction that enables the human being to reflect the image of God.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary with Hume, but {{critical}} of Hume's scepticism, a so-called Scottish school of Common Sense formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:If {{there are certain}} principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> in the common concerns of life, {{without being able to}} give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.|$|E

25|$|Howard Robinson is {{a philosopher}} who has {{concentrated}} his research within {{the philosophy of}} mind. Taking what has been through {{the latter part of}} the last century an unfashionable stance, he has consistently argued against those explanations of sensory experience that would reduce them to physical origins. He has never regarded the theory of sense-data as refuted, but has set out to refute in turn the objections which so many have considered to be conclusive. The version of the theory of sense-data he defends takes what is before consciousness in perception to be qualia as mental presentations that are causally linked to external entities, but which are not physical in themselves. Unlike the philosophers so far mentioned, he is therefore a dualist, one who takes both matter and mind to have real and metaphysically distinct natures. His books (particularly Matter and Sense and Perception) are characterized by the thoroughness with which he deals with the arguments of opposing philosophers, thus setting a professional example that it would be well for his opponents to follow (for there has been a tendency <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that the theory of sense-data is wholly obsolescent). In one of his most recent articles he takes the physicalist to task for ignoring the fact that sensory experience can be entirely free of representational character. He cites phosphenes as a stubborn example (phosphenes are flashes of neural light that result either from sudden pressure in the brain—as induced, for example, by intense coughing, or through direct physical pressure on the retina), and points out that it is grossly counter-intuitive to argue that these are not visual experiences on a par with open-eye seeing.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} used to teach {{literary}} theory at universities beginning not long after publication and remained dominant into the mid-1960s, at which time an increasingly heterogeneous academia questioned the universal value of literature; literary theorist Terry Eagleton finds that, after the 1960s, [...] "it was no longer possible <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> what what literature was, how to read it, or what social functions it might serve". Steven Mailloux describes Theory of Literature as crystallizing an American movement towards intrinsic literary criticism, as dominated by New Criticism, while van Rees credits the book with popularizing a text-oriented interpretation. Grabowicz writes that its importance for both American and general literary studies is [...] "indisputable". Writing in 1987, Jeremy Hawthorn described the book as an [...] "excellent introductory study", despite extrinsic studies having become more dominant in literary criticism, while Holquist found that the book could still [...] "be usefully invoked" [...] in literary debates of the early 21stcentury. In an obituary of Wellek, Robert Thomas Jr. credited Theory of Literature with [...] "introduc European scholarship to the United States" [...] and establishing a framework for comparative literature studies in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Reconstructionist Judaism is an American {{denomination}} {{that has}} a naturalist theology as developed by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan. [...] This theology is {{a variant of the}} naturalism of John Dewey, which combined atheistic beliefs with religious terminology in order to construct a religiously satisfying philosophy for those who had lost faith in traditional religion. [...] Reconstructionism denies that God is either personal or supernatural. [...] Rather, God {{is said to be the}} sum of all natural processes that allow man to become self-fulfilled.

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{controversial}} form of Jewish philosophy that developed in the early 20th century was the religious naturalism of Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan. [...] His theology was a variant of John Dewey's pragmatist philosophy. [...] Dewey's naturalism combined atheist beliefs with religious terminology in order to construct a philosophy {{for those who had}} lost faith in traditional Judaism. [...] In agreement with the classical medieval Jewish thinkers, Kaplan affirmed that haShem is not personal, and that all anthropomorphic descriptions of haShem are, at best, imperfect metaphors. [...] Kaplan's theology went beyond this to claim that haShem is the sum of all natural processes that allow man to become self-fulfilled. [...] Kaplan wrote that [...] "to believe in haShem means <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society." ...|$|E
