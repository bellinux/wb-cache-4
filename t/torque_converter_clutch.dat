All other engines including the Buick 231 V6 and Oldsmobile 260 and 307 Rocket V8s were continued. All gasoline engines received GM's new Computer Command Control engine management system. This system was the forerunner, and surprisingly similar to today's OBDII which is standard on all cars sold in the United States. The system read various parameters such as vehicle speed, throttle position, engine RPM's, coolant temperature, and the oxygen content of the exhaust to provide the correct air/fuel mixture for any given driving condition. Also new for 1981 was GM's Turbo-Hydramatic 200-4R transmission, which added an overdrive gear and <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> <b>clutch</b> (TCC) to contribute to fuel economy and engine longevity.

50|$|Known as {{an input}} speed sensor (ISS).

[...] "Live-drive" [...] meaning the PTO is directly connected to the engines crankshaft, whereas the GM's Allison 1000 transmission and Ram's Aisin use a <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> or <b>clutch</b> (depending on being an automatic or manual, respectively).|$|R
50|$|The SKYACTIV-Drive is {{a family}} of {{automatic}} transmissions, named SKY-Drive.Mazda rejected dual-clutch technology in automatic transmissions, because the dual-clutch behavior in certain situations was sub-optimal. Instead, Mazda chose to re-design the conventional automatic transmission, making the <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> take less duty while a multi-plate <b>clutch</b> disengages the <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> most of the time. The new SkyActiv automatic transmission was designed to have six gears forward, one reverse gear, a short <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> and a <b>clutch</b> integrated with the <b>torque</b> <b>converter.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{electronically}} controlled {{transmission is}} designed around a fully articulated Ravigneaux gearset that {{is controlled by}} electronically timed application of several range-specific hydraulic clutches, in combination with mechanical one-way sprag clutches. The 5L40E unit's centerpiece is an automatic overdrive which supersedes the French-made 4L30E four-speed automatic light-duty gearboxes, and like them features a <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> <b>clutch</b> to eliminate slipping losses in select forward ranges.

5000|$|Along {{with the}} name change, came other major {{improvements}} and tweaks for the final model year of the conventional cab pickups. Single-point electronic throttle-body fuel injection (TBI) was introduced on GM's full-size pickups, with new electric fuel pumps and high-pressure fuel lines. In addition, a [...] "smart" [...] powertrain control module (PCM) was also introduced, which controlled the fuel injection system, fuel-to-air burn ratio, engine ignition timing, and (if equipped with an automatic transmission) the Turbo Hydra-Matic's turbine <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> <b>clutch.</b> The 5.7 L 350 cubic inch pushrod V-8 {{was introduced to the}} order books for R-Series and V-Series half-ton class pickups, with the new TBI fuel injection system.

50|$|Only minor grille and {{taillight}} lens revisions {{highlighted the}} 1981 Delta 88s. The gasoline 350 Rocket V8 was {{dropped from the}} option list, leaving only the diesel version available.

50|$|Depending on the implementation, some {{computer-controlled}} electrohydraulic manual transmissions {{will automatically}} shift gears {{at the right}} points (like an automatic transmission), while others require the driver to manually select the gear even when the engine is at the redline. Despite superficial similarity, clutchless manual transmission differ significantly in internal operation and driver's 'feel' from manumatics, the latter of which is an automatic transmission (automatics use a <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> instead of <b>clutch</b> to manage {{the link between the}} engine and the transmission) with ability to signal shifts manually.|$|R
5000|$|A new 3-speed {{semi-automatic}} {{gear box}} with <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> and vacuum-operated <b>clutch</b> became available mid-production year. The semi-automatic models received a vastly improved semi-trailing-arm rear suspension (also known as [...] "independent rear suspension" [...] although the earlier swing axle Beetles were also independent) and eliminated {{the need for}} the equalizing torsion spring. This new rear suspension layout would eventually become an option on later models. Beetles equipped with the automatic were identified with a [...] "VW Automatic" [...] badge on the engine lid and a matching decal in the rear window. In North America, the badging and decal were later revised to read, [...] "Automatic Stick Shift".|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{superficial}} {{similarity to}} other automated transmissions, semi-automatic transmissions differ significantly in internal operation and driver's [...] "feel" [...] from manumatics and CVTs. A manumatic, like a standard automatic transmission, uses a <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> instead of <b>clutch</b> {{to manage the}} link between the transmission and the engine, while a CVT uses a belt instead of a fixed number of gears. A semi-automatic transmission offers a more direct connection between the engine and wheels than a manumatic and this responsiveness is preferred in high performance driving applications, while a manumatic is better for street use because its fluid coupling makes it easier for the transmission to consistently perform smooth shifts, and CVTs are generally found in gasoline-electric hybrid engine applications.|$|R
50|$|This was a later {{model of}} the 125 that debuted for 1982 and {{included}} a <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> <b>clutch</b> or TCC. The TCC acts similar to a clutch in a manual transmission vehicle, in that at speeds above 50 MPH a combination of engine vacuum- and temperature-sensing valves, and a dedicated brake switch - and in later models an ECU - activated a solenoid which engaged a clutch physically locking the impeller and turbine inside the torque converter together causing engine power to be transferred directly to the transaxle. The C in Turbo-Hydramatic 125 C denoted {{the use of a}} TCC. The solenoid that controls this is notorious for failure due to overheated plastic componentry, and problems indicated by an engine stall when stopping from speeds greater than 55 MPH. This occurs because the clutch does not disengage, and as the affected vehicle's speed nears zero miles per hour, the engine is forced to decelerate to zero rpm.|$|E
50|$|Through {{the late}} 1970s, Ford {{transmissions}} were factory {{filled with a}} fluid identified as ESW M2C33-F. To provide a fluid that {{would be available to}} the general public for service fill, oil companies and other than factory fill suppliers were allowed to develop fluids meeting the ESW M2C33-F specification and market these fluids under their own brand names but identified as Type F. A second generation of transmission fluid was released in 1974 as the factory fill specification, ESW M2C138-CJ. This fluid was developed to modify the vehicle shifting characteristics and to provide considerable improvement in the oxidation resistance and anti-wear performance. No service fluids were developed and for a short time, DEXRON fluids approved by General Motors were considered acceptable.With continuing changes and improvements in transmission design, a centrifugal lock-up <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> <b>clutch</b> was introduced into the C5 transmission to smooth engine vibrations sensed by the occupant of the vehicle. An associated shudder problem forced the introduction of the factory fill specification ESP M2C166-H. Servicing transmissions with DEXRON fluids was unacceptable since not all DEXRON fluids were capable of eliminating the shudder phenomenon. The fluids that could be used were a subset of the DEXRON fluids.The advent of Type H as factory fill necessitated the development of a service fluid specification to match the performance expected from Type H. This resulted in the release of the MERCON specification in 1987.|$|E
50|$|Pontiac sub-contracted {{the job of}} {{engineering}} the TTA engine modifications to PAS. The narrow engine bay of the Trans Am required the use of different cylinder heads, which happened to have better flow characteristics than the old Buick heads. Special stainless steel headers were made specifically for the project as well. The heads, headers, along with more refined tuning of the boost and fuel curves, all added up to a more powerful package than the older Buicks. PAS was also in charge of testing and assembling the engines. Most TTA's came with T-tops and leather interior, {{but there were also}} hardtops and cloth-interior cars. And every TTA had an automatic transmission - the TH200-4R, equipped with overdrive and a <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> <b>clutch.</b> The three actual pace cars were randomly selected from the production run, and sent to Indianapolis to pace the race. Thus, the pace car replicas were closer to the actual pace cars than any replica previously offered; the only difference between the replicas and the three actual pace cars was the addition of strobe lights and safety equipment to the latter. In addition, the TTA was relatively economical to drive; it returned 24 mpg on the highway, while the only cars (besides the Lotus Esprit Turbo SE) that could approach its performance at the time (Ferraris, Lamborghinis, etc.) were far more costly, and providing only around 10 to 12 mpg. As has been proven to be the case in subsequent years, relying on a small engine for cruising, and a turbocharger for power, provides an exciting driving experience while returning impressive fuel mileage.|$|E
50|$|The C {{series was}} {{introduced}} in August 1969 with an enlarged 2.2-litre engine (84 mm bore x 66 mm stroke). The wheelbase for all 911 and 912 models was increased from 2211 to(-) 2268 mm, to help remedy to the cars' nervous handling at the limit. The overall length of the car did not change, but the rear wheels were relocated further back. Fuel injection arrived for the 911S (901/10 engine) and for a new middle model, 911E (901/09 engine). A semi-automatic Sportomatic model, composed of a <b>torque</b> <b>converter,</b> an automatic <b>clutch,</b> and the four-speed transmission was added. It was canceled after the 1980 model year {{partly because of the}} elimination of a forward gear to make it a three-speed.|$|R
50|$|The {{shift from}} third to fourth gear locked the forward gear assembly, {{producing}} 1.00:1 transmission. The fluid coupling now only handled about 25 {{percent of the}} engine torque, reducing slippage to a negligible amount. The result was a remarkably efficient level of power transfer at highway speeds, something that <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> equipped automatics could not achieve {{without the benefit of}} a <b>converter</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{domestic}} {{automotive industry}} {{the need for}} transition from transmission with manual control to automatic gearboxes (GB) emerged long ago. Regarding the leading foreign manufacturers (Allison, ZF, Eaton, etc.), an experience in design of automatic transmissions {{and the level of}} technological development is incomparably small. Thus, to have an informed choice of the gearbox structure types and control system is a relevant problem. Application efficiency of this or other gearbox depends both on its adaptability to the actual operating conditions and on the quality of transition refinement. This paper analyzes the special features of the gear change process in the most common types of automatic gearboxes. Constructive feasibilities of an "ideal" gear change (without power loss) and strategies for gear shifting are compared. The paper offers an overview of common problems when achieving these goals and the ways to solve them. An automatic transmission of the particular type used in the wheeled vehicles under off-road conditions determines the probability of maintaining their mobility. This is due to the phenomenon of wheel`s breakdown to slipping caused by sharp increase of torque on the wheel. Planetary hydromechanical transmissions (AT) provide continuous input torque to the wheels, but they are expensive and difficult to manufacture and use. Besides, to provide a high number of density ratios in them is more complicated than in the automated and manual transmissions (AMT). This is important when moving long in the lower gears under difficult conditions. Compared with AT dual clutch transmissions due to design features require even more precise and fast control system of actuators and engine. Automation of constant-mesh or synchromesh transmissions provides a significant reduction in the duration of interruption in torque delivery. If {{it is not enough to}} increase mobility in the harsh conditions, a rational choice is to use a transmission type of TCCT (<b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> – <b>clutch</b> – (constant-mesh or synchromesh) transmission). Adding the <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> to AMT increases the durability of clutch and synchronizers. It reduces the amount of gear changes and duration of interruption in torque delivery. Thus, the cost and repair complexity of such a transmission is much lower than those of AT. For almost 15 years there were no domestic scientific publications about economically perspective TCCT transmission. The fully automatic TCCT has been never investigated in domestic science...|$|R
