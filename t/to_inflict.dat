5|$|A spine is a sharp, {{needle-like}} structure used <b>to</b> <b>inflict</b> pain on predators. An {{example of}} this seen in nature is in the Sohal surgeonfish. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine {{on the front of}} each of their tail fins, able <b>to</b> <b>inflict</b> deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish. Defensive spines may be detachable, barbed or poisonous. Porcupine spines are long, stiff, break at the tip, and are barbed to stick into a would-be predator. In contrast, the hedgehog's short spines, which are modified hairs, readily bend, and are barbed into the body, so they are not easily lost; they may be jabbed at an attacker.|$|E

5|$|Austrian losses {{amounted}} to 12 {{percent of total}} forces engaged, high for an eighteenth-century siege; the losses were due to sorties in which the French were able <b>to</b> <b>inflict</b> heavy damages. Gaston Bodart estimated that of the 40,000 men who participated on the Coalition side, 4,800 were lost. Based on Moreau's Memoirs, John Philippart estimated that the Austrian losses were lower: 3,000 troops killed or wounded and 1,000 taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} 19th-century warfare, {{historian}} James Reid posits that Anderson suffered from delusional paranoia, which exacerbated his aggressive, sadistic personality. He sees Anderson as obsessed with, and greatly enjoying, the ability <b>to</b> <b>inflict</b> fear and suffering in his victims, and suggests he suffered from the most severe type of sadistic personality disorder. Reid draws a parallel between the bashi-bazouks and Anderson's group, arguing that they behaved similarly.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Pyongtaek was {{the second}} {{engagement}} between United States and North Korean forces during the Korean War, occurring on July 6, 1950 {{in the village of}} Pyongtaek in western South Korea.

5|$|Aided by air strikes, U.S. Army {{units were}} able <b>to</b> <b>inflict</b> {{substantial}} {{damage on the}} North Korean armor and other vehicles, but were overwhelmed by North Korean infantry. The two understrength U.S. battalions fought in several engagements over the three-day period and suffered massive losses in personnel and equipment, but were able to delay the North Korean forces for several days, allowing {{the remainder of the}} 24th Infantry Division to set up blocking positions along the Kum River near the city of Taejon.|$|E
5|$|American {{intelligence}} analysts were quite baffled by {{this series of}} enemy actions. For them {{there appeared to be}} no logic behind the sustained NVA/NLF offensives, other than <b>to</b> <b>inflict</b> casualties on the allied forces. This they accomplished, but the casualties absorbed by the North Vietnamese seemed to negate any direct gains they might have obtained. The border battles did, however, have two significant consequences that were unappreciated at the time—they fixed the attention of the American command on the border regions and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.|$|E

Macartney's return to form was interrupted by an illness, which caused him to miss the following three Test matches. After a two-month layoff, Macartney struck 130 in a match for his state against England.|$|E

5000|$|To {{put things}} in perspective, most anti-personnel blast mines (e.g. the VS-50) contain around 50 grams of explosive, which is enough to destroy {{all or part of}} a victim's foot. In marked contrast, the 300 gram charge inside a Gyata-64 mine can easily destroy a victim's entire leg (often {{requiring}} amputation high above the knee) in addition <b>to</b> <b>inflicting</b> severe injuries on the adjacent limb, which may also require some form of amputation.|$|R

5|$|In {{the course}} of four hours, a series of blunders in {{planning}} and communication had caused Lee's forces to launch three failed frontal infantry assaults across hundreds of yards of open ground, unsupported by Confederate artillery, charging toward firmly entrenched Union infantry and artillery defenses. These errors provided Union forces with an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>inflict</b> heavy casualties. In {{the aftermath of the}} battle, however, the Confederate press heralded Lee as the savior of Richmond. In stark contrast, McClellan was accused of being absent from the battlefield, a harsh criticism that haunted him when he ran for president in 1864.|$|E
5|$|In the {{folklore}} of Croats of Ravni Kotari, {{a region}} in northern Dalmatia, there were men called vidogoja. They {{were believed to}} know past and future things.

50|$|Similarly, {{by the end}} of the War of Independence the National Army of Liberation {{numbered}} nearly 50,000 {{of which}} only about 25,000 were armed. The leaders, having learnt from previous mistakes, had organized the army into “6 corps with 14 divisions, 34 brigades, 50 regiments of infantry and 34 cavalry.” Even though, once again, they were limited on resources, their bravery and cunning made it possible <b>to</b> <b>inflicting</b> 71,000 casualties* out of the 250,000 Spanish troops sent to the island.|$|R
