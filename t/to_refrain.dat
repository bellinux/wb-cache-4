5|$|Al-Azhar {{also served}} as a focal point for protests against the Ottoman {{occupation}} of Egypt, both from within the ulema and from among the general public. Student protests at al-Azhar were common, and shops {{in the vicinity of the}} mosque would often close out of solidarity with the students. The ulema was also on occasion able to defy the government. In one instance, in 1730–31, Ottoman aghas harassed the residents living near al-Azhar while pursuing three fugitives. The gates at al-Azhar were closed in protest and the Ottoman governor, fearing a larger uprising, ordered the aghas <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> from going near al-Azhar. Another disturbance occurred in 1791 in which the wāli harassed the people near the al-Hussein Mosque, who then went to al-Azhar to demonstrate. The wāli was subsequently dismissed from his post.|$|E

Joining them on the sidelines were two more prominent drivers: both Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa suffered from problems with their power units, finishing 16th and 17th respectively.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to collect information about the behaviors expected of nurses in their 4 th or 5 th year of hospital services. A total of 903 behaviors were recorded. Ail these behaviors were perceived as important by the nurses concerned. This paper will report our analysis of 260 items, excluding behaviors of nurses relative to their families, superiors or subordinates. We found {{that many of these}} behaviors pertained <b>to</b> <b>refraining</b> from taking leadership in a way which might have a negative effect. The respondents attached more importance to performing desired behaviors and less importance <b>to</b> <b>refraining</b> from performing undesired behaviors. The patterns of activity varied, depending on the situation in the given hospital or the particular nurse concerned. Even behaviors of less importance were given high priority, depending on conditions at the particular hospital or ward, or the particular nurse involved. We {{think it is important to}} summarize these behaviors, to create a list of the behaviors expected of nurses in their 4 th or 5 th year of hospital service...|$|R

Sabah, where all tabloids but one are independent of government control, has the freest press in Malaysia. Laws such as the Printing Presses and Publications Act have also been cited as curtailing freedom of expression.|$|E

The following day, Hasan's fleet fired roughly 7,000 shells against Acre without returning {{fire from the}} city's artillerymen; al-Dinkizli had called on his Maghrebi forces <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> from returning fire because as Muslims they were forbidden from attacking the sultan's military. Realizing his long-time deputy commander's betrayal, he attempted to flee Acre on 21 August or 22 August. As he departed its gates, he was fired on by Ottoman troops, with a bullet striking his neck and causing him to fall off his horse. A Maghrebi soldier then decapitated him. Zahir's severed head was subsequently delivered to Istanbul.|$|E

He also sent an auxiliary troop to his father-in-law, who was waging a war against the Holy See and Venice. The 1482 truce between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire was prolonged for two years in 1488. On this occasion, it was stipulated that the Ottomans were <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> from invading Wallachia and Moldavia.

Whatever the case, Karađorđe entertained senior rebel leaders in his home while his brother's lifeless body dangled from the front gate—a warning to others <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> from the behaviour in which Marinko had been engaging.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{sought to}} expand {{the power of the}} priests, as from the {{beginning}} of their empire, priests had accompanied Portuguese delegations on diplomatic missions and on occasion were the principal negotiatiors. Treaties they signed with the Keladi Nayakas progressively incorporated clauses which increased the authority of the priests over the local Catholic population, making them obedient to the priests in matters of Christian laws as well as granting priests the authority to punish violations. The Portuguese promised <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> from slaughtering cows and to halt forcible conversions in their factories. The terms of these treaties were not always honoured by the Portuguese, with the result that whenever hostilities broke out between the Keladis and the Portuguese, the Catholic settlers were often harassed or arrested by the Nayakas.|$|E
