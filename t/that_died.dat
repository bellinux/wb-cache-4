5|$|Historians {{are divided}} on Hugh Bardulf's ancestry. Katharine Keats-Rohan {{says that he}} was the son of Hamelin Bardulf, a tenant of Hugh Bigod, who held land in Suffolk. Ralph V. Turner, {{revising}} John Horace Round's entry in the Dictionary of National Biography for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography says that Hugh was the son of a Hugh Bardulf <b>that</b> <b>died</b> around 1176. According to Turner and Round, the younger Hugh's mother was Isabel, who may have been a member of the Twist family from Lincolnshire. The younger Hugh acquired land at Waddington, Lincolnshire as a tenant of Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester, sometime in the middle 1140s.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found that plants {{can be a}} vector for prions. When researchers fed hamsters grass that grew on ground where a deer <b>that</b> <b>died</b> with chronic wasting disease (CWD) was buried, the hamsters became ill with CWD, suggesting that prions can bind to plants, which then take them up into the leaf and stem structure, {{where they can be}} eaten by herbivores, thus completing the cycle. It is thus possible that there is a progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment.|$|E

5|$|The bishop's {{violent death}} itself was nothing {{exceptional}} and {{could well have}} happened. Many bishops were murdered during the turmoils of the 12th and 13th centuries, although most were not elevated to sainthood. Saxo Grammaticus said of the Battle of Fotevik in 1134 that never had so many bishops been killed at the same time. Notable bishops <b>that</b> <b>died</b> violently included the Archbishop of Uppsala in 1187, Bishop of Estonia in 1219 and Bishop of Linköping in 1220.|$|E
5|$|The killer whale's intelligence, trainability, {{striking}} appearance, playfulness {{in captivity}} and sheer size {{have made it}} a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales {{were taken from the}} wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals <b>that</b> <b>died</b> during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.|$|E
5|$|While {{the events}} in this episode mostly follow the book, {{differences}} in the screen adaptation include not introducing the council's delegation with Ser Barristan and Lord Renly and the conversation between Robert and Eddard taking place during breakfast instead of on horseback. Some scenes were also created for the series, most notably a conversation between Catelyn and Cersei at Bran's bedside remembering the Queen's first child by Robert <b>that</b> <b>died</b> early of sickness (in the novel, when Ned confronts Cersei about Jaime fathering her children, she hinted that her first pregnancy, which was by Robert, she had aborted), and a confrontation between Jaime and Jon before Jon leaves for the Wall.|$|E

A bacterium <b>that</b> <b>dies</b> when exposed to room temperature (thermophilic) requires a pre-warmed transport container, and a microbe <b>that</b> dries and <b>dies</b> when carried on a cotton swab will need a viral transport medium before it can be cultured successfully.|$|R
5|$|A {{different}} {{school of}} thought developed {{almost half a century}} later, with palaeontologist David Weishampel suggesting that the skeletons from the lower layers stemmed from a herd <b>that</b> <b>died</b> catastrophically in a mudflow, while those in the upper layers accumulated over time. Weishampel explained the curious monospecific assemblage by theorizing that Plateosaurus were common during this period. This theory was erroneously attributed to Seemann in a popular account of the plateosaurs {{in the collection of the}} Institute and Museum for Geology and Palaeontology, University of Tübingen, and has since become the standard explanation on most internet sites and in popular books on dinosaurs. Rieber proposed a more elaborate scenario, which included the animals dying of thirst or starvation, and being concentrated by mudflows.|$|E
5|$|Bhimsen Thapa {{was born}} in August 1775 at Pipal Thok village of Gorkha district, to father Amar Singh Thapa (Sardar)(sanu) and mother Satyarupa Maya. His {{ancestors}} were members of Bagale Thapa clan from Jumla who migrated eastwards. His grandfather was Bir Bhadra Thapa, a courtier in Prithvi Narayan Shah's army. Bhimsen Thapa had four brothers—Nain Singh Thapa, Bhaktabar Singh Thapa, Amrit Singh Thapa, and Ranabir Singh Thapa. From his step-mother, he had two brothers—Ranbam and Ranzawar. While it is not certain when Bhimsen got married, he had three wives with whom he begot one son, <b>that</b> <b>died</b> {{at an early age}} in 1796, and three daughters – Lalita Devi, Janak Kumari and Dirgha Kumari. Lack of a son caused him to adopt Sher Jung Thapa, son of his brother Nain Singh Thapa.|$|E
5|$|Both {{inside and}} outside battle, characters' {{relationships}} can be developed through interactions {{on and off the}} battlefield. As the strength of their relationships grow, certain abilities in battle are also strengthened. A feature introduced in Genealogy of the Holy War and used in later titles was an aspect of relationships. A man and woman who fall in love will have a child, and that child will inherit certain skills and stats from them. One of the recurring features in the series is permanent death, a function in which units defeated in battle are permanently removed {{from the rest of the}} game with very few exceptions (the main character, a character pivotal to the main story). Up until Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem: Heroes of Light and Shadow, there was no option to disable permanent death. In New Mystery of the Emblem, a new Casual Mode was added, in which characters <b>that</b> <b>died</b> were revived at the end of a battle. Fates also added Phoenix Mode, in which characters slain during one turn are revived on the player's next turn. Another inclusion from Fates includes 'My Castle', a customisable castle that serves as the player's base of operations throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|Godwin's books {{begin to}} {{incorporate}} religious themes starting with Father Melancholy's Daughter (1991). The novel is told {{from the perspective}} of multiple characters, each of whom have a different perspective on religion. Father Melancholy's Daughter was followed by several books that centered on the Episcopal church and Christian practices. In these novels female and male characters have a more equal influence on the events and plot than in prior novels. Godwin's books neither evangelize nor mock the practices of the Episcopal Church, but rather treat it as a routine aspect of life, or as a subject of intellectual interest. During these years Godwin's books continued to show father figures who have died or are absent. By 1996 two of her books had fathers <b>that</b> <b>died</b> and five had stepfathers that are depicted as intruding on the mother-daughter relationship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s Credit Suisse began {{catering}} to consumers and the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts. The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel. The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts. During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts. After World War II, {{a substantial portion}} of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts. Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives <b>that</b> <b>died</b> in concentration camps without death certificates. This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996 that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion. The Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise of Due Diligence was created in the 1970s, after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, the Aggies {{upset the}} Texas Longhorns, winning 20–16 {{in the annual}} rivalry game. The game began with a flyover of F-16 jets, all piloted by former A students, in the missing man formation. This flyover was donated by Senator Phil Gramm who, as an elected official, had {{the title of a}} fly-over reserved for his death and asked that the fly-over be given instead in the honor of the 12 Aggies <b>that</b> <b>died.</b> At halftime, the Texas Longhorn Band dedicated their performance to the students lost and injured in the collapse, and ended by playing Amazing Grace and Taps, then removing their white hats in a show of respect as they walked off the field. The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band also played a tribute to the fallen and, contrary to the usual tradition, marched off the field in a silent cadence. Aggie students, who normally sit only when the opposing band plays, stood throughout both performances and gave both standing ovations.|$|E

5|$|Like modern elephants, Columbian mammoths were {{probably}} social {{and lived in}} matriarchal (female-led) family groups; most of their other social behavior was also {{similar to that of}} modern elephants. This is supported by fossil assemblages such as the Dent Site in Colorado and the Waco Mammoth National Monument in Waco, Texas, where groups consisting entirely of female and juvenile Columbian mammoths have been found (implying female-led family groups). The latter assemblage includes 22 skeletons, with 15 individuals representing a herd of females and juveniles <b>that</b> <b>died</b> in a single event. It was originally proposed that the herd was killed by a flash flood, and that the arrangement of some of the skeletons suggests that the females may have formed a defensive ring around the juveniles. In 2016, it was instead suggested that the herd had died by drought near a diminishing watering hole; scavenging traces on the bones contradicts rapid burial, and the absence of calves and large diversity of other animal species found gathered at the site support this scenario. Another group, consisting of a bull and six females, is found at the same site; although both groups died between 64,000 and 73,000 years ago, whether they died in the same event is unknown. At the Murray Springs Clovis Site in Arizona, where several Columbian mammoth skeletons have been excavated, a trackway similar to that left by modern elephants leads to one of the skeletons. The mammoth may have made the trackway before it died, or another individual may have approached the dead or dying animal—similar to the way modern elephants guard dead relatives for several days.|$|E
5|$|Rupture of the trachea or {{bronchus}} is {{the most}} common type of blunt injury to the airway. It is difficult to determine the incidence of TBI: in as many as 30–80% of cases, death occurs before the person reaches a hospital, and these people may not be included in studies. On the other hand, some TBI are so small that they do not cause significant symptoms and are therefore never noticed. In addition, the injury sometimes is not associated with symptoms until complications develop later, further hindering estimation of the true incidence. However, autopsy studies have revealed TBI in 2.5–3.2% of people who died after trauma. Of all neck and chest traumas, including people <b>that</b> <b>died</b> immediately, TBI is estimated to occur in 0.5–2%. An estimated 0.5% of polytrauma patients treated in trauma centers have TBI. The incidence is estimated at 2% in blunt chest and neck trauma and 1–2% in penetrating chest trauma. Laryngotracheal injuries occur in 8% of patients with penetrating injury to the neck, and TBI occurs in 2.8% of blunt chest trauma deaths. In people with blunt trauma who do reach a hospital alive, reports have found incidences of 2.1% and 5.3%. Another study of blunt chest trauma revealed an incidence of only 0.3%, but a mortality rate of 67% (possibly due in part to associated injuries). The incidence of iatrogenic TBI (that caused by medical procedures) is rising, and the risk may be higher for women and the elderly. TBI results about once every 20,000 times someone is intubated through the mouth, but when intubation is performed emergently, the incidence may be as high as 15%.|$|E
