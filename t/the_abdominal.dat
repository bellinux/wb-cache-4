5|$|Abdominal {{segments}} 3–6 and 10 each bear {{a pair of}} {{legs that}} are more fleshy. The thoracic legs are known as true legs and <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> legs are called prolegs. The true legs vary little in the Lepidoptera except for reduction in certain leaf-miners and elongation in the family Notodontidae. The prolegs contain {{a number of small}} hooks on the tip, which are known as crochets. The families of Lepidoptera differ in the number and positioning of their prolegs. Some larvae such as inchworms (Geometridae) and loopers (Plusiinae) have five pairs of prolegs or less, while others like Lycaenidae and slug caterpillars (Limacodidae) lack prolegs altogether. In some leaf-mining caterpillars there are crochets present on <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> wall which are reduced prolegs, while other leaf-mining species lack the crochets entirely. <b>The</b> <b>abdominal</b> spiracles are located {{on each side of the}} body on the first eight abdominal segments.|$|E
5|$|Particular fats (chelev): {{particular}} {{parts of}} <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> fat of cattle, goats and sheep {{must be removed}} by a process called nikkur.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{are mostly}} white, but the front {{half of the}} rostrum, and {{the sides of the}} abdomen, are pink. Bright red bands extend across the base of the rostrum, the {{posterior}} edge of the carapace, the chelipeds, and each of <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> segments. The dorsal parts of the abdomen are brown, and there are two brown saddles on the dorsal carapace.|$|E

50|$|This pose {{has many}} benefits: it {{increases}} spinal flexibility, stimulates the internal organs, stretches <b>the</b> <b>abdominals,</b> <b>the</b> chest {{and the front}} of the shoulders. Practitioners discourage those knee or spinal injuries from performing the pose.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{transverse}} <b>abdominal</b> {{helps to}} compress the ribs and viscera, providing thoracic and pelvic stability. This is explained further here. <b>The</b> transverse <b>abdominal</b> also helps {{a pregnant woman}} to deliver her child.|$|R
5|$|In 2013, a well-preserved carcass {{was found}} on Maly Lyakhovsky Island, one of the islands in the New Siberian Islands archipelago, a female between 50 and 60 {{years old at the}} time of death. The carcass {{contained}} well-preserved muscular tissue. When it was extracted from the ice, liquid blood spilled from <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> cavity. The finders interpreted this as indicating woolly mammoth blood possessed anti-freezing properties.|$|E
5|$|Superior {{mesenteric}} artery syndrome (SMA) is {{an extremely}} rare life-threatening condition that can either be congenital and chronic, or induced and acute. SMA Syndrome is characterised by compression of the duodenum between <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> aorta and the superior mesenteric artery, and maywhen congenitalresult from a short suspensory muscle. One surgical treatment is Strong's operation, which involves cutting the suspensory muscle, though this is not often carried out.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E
40|$|Herniated gravid uterus in an incisional hernia of <b>the</b> {{anterior}} <b>abdominal</b> wall {{is relatively}} rare. A 30 -year-old house wife {{presented with a}} six month gravid uterus that had herniated through an incisional hernia of <b>the</b> anterior <b>abdominal</b> wall. She had non-operative management till term, when she then had elective lower caesarian section. Physiotherapy of <b>the</b> anterior <b>abdominal</b> wall muscles to improve their tone was done. She subsequently had keel&#x 2032;s repair of the hernia. Aggressive physiotherapy of <b>the</b> anterior <b>abdominal</b> wall muscles followed by keel&#x 2032;s repair may be an alternative surgical technique in patients with a moderate defect of incisional hernia...|$|R
30|$|The {{anatomical}} {{relations of}} <b>the</b> anterior <b>abdominal</b> wall may be variable and different under pneumoperitoneum. The insufflation of the abdomen will stretch <b>the</b> anterior <b>abdominal</b> wall {{and change the}} standard anatomical landmarks and measurements.|$|R
5000|$|During {{breathing}} the diaphragm contracts and flattens, displacing the viscera and producing an outward movement of <b>the</b> upper <b>abdominal</b> wall (epigastric region). It is {{a convergence of}} the diaphragm and <b>the</b> <b>abdominals,</b> so that [...] "when both sets of muscles (diaphragm and <b>abdominals)</b> tense, <b>the</b> epigastrium pushes forward". [...] Therefore, the epigastric region is not a muscle nor is it an organ, {{but it is a}} zone of activity where the actions of the rectus abdominus and the diaphragm produce an outward bulging of <b>the</b> upper <b>abdominal</b> wall. It is also the spot where the Heimlich Maneuver is able to produce a rapid and forceful exhalation of breath.|$|R
5|$|The opisthosoma {{consists}} of twelve or fewer segments that originally formed two groups, a mesosoma of seven segments and a metasoma of five, terminating with a telson or spike. <b>The</b> <b>abdominal</b> appendages of modern chelicerates are missing or heavily modified – {{for example in}} spiders the remaining appendages form spinnerets that extrude silk, while those of horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura) form gills.|$|E
5|$|Analgesics may {{be needed}} for <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> and joint pains. It is {{uncertain}} as to whether HSP needs treatment beyond controlling the symptoms. Most patients do not receive therapy {{because of the high}} spontaneous recovery rate. Steroids are generally avoided. However, if they are given early in the disease episode, the duration of symptoms may be shortened, and abdominal pain can improve significantly. Moreover, the chance of severe kidney problems may be reduced. A systematic review of randomized clinical trials did not find any evidence that steroid treatment (prednisone) is effective at decreasing the likelihood of developing long-term kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Ants are {{distinct}} in their morphology from other insects in having elbowed antennae, metapleural glands, {{and a strong}} constriction of their second abdominal segment into a node-like petiole. The head, mesosoma, and metasoma are the three distinct body segments. The petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma (thorax plus the first abdominal segment, which is fused to it) and gaster (abdomen less <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> segments in the petiole). The petiole may be formed by one or two nodes (the second alone, or {{the second and third}} abdominal segments).|$|E
50|$|The quadratus lumborum is {{a muscle}} of <b>the</b> {{posterior}} <b>abdominal</b> wall. It is <b>the</b> deepest <b>abdominal</b> muscle and {{commonly referred to}} as a back muscle. It is irregular and quadrilateral in shape and broader below than above.|$|R
5000|$|The {{superficial}} perineal pouch {{is an open}} compartment, due to {{the fact}} that anteriorly, the space communicates freely with the potential space lying between the superficial fascia of <b>the</b> anterior <b>abdominal</b> wall and <b>the</b> anterior <b>abdominal</b> muscles: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{activity}} of <b>the</b> oblique <b>abdominal</b> muscles was investigated with the trunk in unconstrained, symmetrical and static postures. Electromyographic recordings in six healthy subjects revealed {{that in all}} subjects the {{activity of}} both the internal and the external obliques is significantly higher in unconstrained standing than in supine posture. Activity of the internal oblique was {{higher than that of}} <b>the</b> external oblique <b>abdominal.</b> <b>The</b> sacrospinal, gluteus maximus and biceps femoris muscles showed practically no activity in unconstrained erect posture. During unconstrained sitting both oblique abdominals are active. In most subjects the activity of <b>the</b> oblique <b>abdominals</b> was significantly smaller when sitting on a soft car seat than when sitting on an office chair with a hard seat. The possibility is discussed that contraction of <b>the</b> oblique <b>abdominals</b> in unconstrained standing and sitting may help in stabilizing the basis of the spine and particularly the sacroiliac joints. During standing and sitting <b>the</b> oblique <b>abdominal</b> muscles apparently have a significant role in sustaining gravity loads...|$|R
5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Dr. Don Gregorio Chil y Naranjo {{discovered}} several incisions in some mummies that he speculated {{may have}} been used to remove the internal organs. Don Brothwell's work in 1969 confirmed that evisceration was a method used by the Guanche. Along with a team of other scientists, Brothwell conducted a pathological examination of a Guanche mummy. The examination revealed that the body had been eviscerated, then <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> and thoracic cavities had been packed with a mud-like substance that contained the bark of a pine tree. Some sort of packing was also applied subcutaneously, but the exact make-up of this particular embalming substance is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In {{patients}} of normal intelligence, rumination {{is not an}} intentional behavior and is habitually reversed using diaphragmatic breathing to counter the urge to regurgitate. Alongside reassurance, explanation and habit reversal, patients are shown how to breathe using their diaphragms prior to and during the normal rumination period. A similar breathing pattern {{can be used to}} prevent normal vomiting. Breathing in this method works by physically preventing <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> contractions required to expel stomach contents.|$|E
50|$|The second color {{variation}} is found along the central coast in California. It has yellow {{hair on the}} sides of <b>the</b> second <b>abdominal</b> segment and all of <b>the</b> third <b>abdominal</b> segment and a reddish-brown hair on fifth abdominal segment.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the sit-up, in {{a proper}} crunch, the lower back stays on the floor. This is said by {{scientific}} literature to eliminate any involvement by the hip flexors, and make the crunch an effective isolation exercise for <b>the</b> <b>abdominals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Like all Apocrita, gall wasps have a {{distinctive}} body shape, the so-called wasp waist. <b>The</b> first <b>abdominal</b> tergum (<b>the</b> propodeum) is conjoined with the thorax, while <b>the</b> second <b>abdominal</b> segment forms {{a sort of}} shaft, the petiole. The petiole connects with the gaster, which is the functional abdomen in apocritan wasps, starting with <b>the</b> third <b>abdominal</b> segment proper. Together, the petiole and the gaster form the metasoma, while the thorax and the propodeum make up the mesosoma.|$|R
5|$|In the 1960s, the Duke's health deteriorated. In December 1964, he was {{operated}} on by Michael E. DeBakey in Houston for an aneurysm of <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> aorta, and in February 1965 a detached retina {{in his left}} eye was treated by Sir Stewart Duke-Elder. In late 1971, the Duke, who was a smoker from an early age, was diagnosed with throat cancer and underwent cobalt therapy. On 18 May 1972, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Windsors while on a state visit to France; she spoke with the Duke for fifteen minutes but only the Duchess appeared with the royal party for a photocall as the Duke was too ill.|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction, the {{tightening of}} small {{blood vessels in}} the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension), which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle, the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right ventricle undergoes remodeling, becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins. When this is the case, raised hydrostatic pressure leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> cavity.|$|E
5|$|M.challengeri is {{considered}} {{to have the most}} primitive morphology of any species of Metanephrops, having even fewer novelties than the oldest known fossil species, M.rossensis. Its rostrum is longer than that of other species in the thomsoni species group, and the ridge along the midline of the carapace only has two small spines. Unlike some other species of Metanephrops, the carapace is smooth, as are <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> tergae, and the chelipeds are covered in fine granules.|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} erect and supine {{abdominal}} radiographs and erect chest radiographs was analysed prospectively in 102 consecutive patients admitted to hospital with acute <b>abdominal</b> symptoms. <b>The</b> radiographs were reported on initially by junior surgeons of the admitting team, special note being {{made of the}} value of <b>the</b> erect <b>abdominal</b> radiograph over <b>the</b> combination of <b>the</b> supine <b>abdominal</b> radiograph and erect chest radiograph. On the basis of information obtained from <b>the</b> erect <b>abdominal</b> radiograph alone no changes in patient management were recorded. A consultant radiologist reported on the same radiographs at a later date. In five cases <b>the</b> erect <b>abdominal</b> radiograph was thought to have contributed useful or additional information, although in four of these cases abnormal features were visible in the supine film. In three of the five cases important but subtle information was missed by junior surgeons. In five of the 102 patients information obtained from <b>the</b> erect <b>abdominal</b> radiograph was potentially misleading. The small yield of positive information, potentially misleading features, and lack of effect on surgical management suggest that the routine use of <b>the</b> erect <b>abdominal</b> radiograph in <b>the</b> acute abdomen should be abandoned...|$|R

5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the sole of the foot venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurs had {{self-sharpening}} {{teeth that}} would have been useful for cropping and slicing tough plant material. Unlike later ceratopsians, they did not have teeth suitable for grinding or chewing their food. Instead, they used gastroliths—stones swallowed to wear down food as it passed through the digestive system. Sometimes numbering more than fifty, these stones are occasionally found in <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> cavities of psittacosaurs, and may have been stored in a gizzard, as in modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Soft tissue was {{apparently}} preserved with the specimen, but was subsequently removed during preparation. Covering the limbs {{and the rest}} of the body was a layer of smooth, multilayered calcite, which was originally interpreted as preservation of decaying skin. Additionally, an accumulation of sediment in <b>the</b> <b>abdominal</b> region may have represented gut contents, with both gastroliths and digested bones. However, since both samples of the alleged soft tissue are no longer available, it is impossible to verify these interpretations.|$|E

40|$|Thirty-eight field force {{soldiers}} were studied {{to investigate the}} influence of training with repetitive dynamic curl-ups on the static holding capacity of abdominals for lumbopelvic control when load was progressively applied via lower limb movements. Results indicated that when high numbers of curl-ups (> 51) were able to be performed continuously, the static capacity of <b>the</b> <b>abdominals</b> was higher (p < 0. 01). However, the ability to statically hold {{was found to be}} even more dependent on the speed at which the curl-up was performed (p < 0. 0001). Those regularly performing the curl-up at a rapid rate demonstrated decreased static <b>abdominal</b> function. <b>The</b> results suggest that when training <b>the</b> <b>abdominals</b> for a stability function, curl-up exercises should be performed at a slow controlled rate...|$|R
