25|$|In 1931 Erich Gaichen invented {{and drove}} from Altenburg to Berlin a 1/2 {{horsepower}} electric car containing features later incorporated into hybrid cars. Its maximum speed was , {{but it was}} licensed by the Motor Transport Office, taxed by the German Revenue Department and patented by the German Reichs-Patent Amt. The car battery was re-charged by the motor when the car went downhill. Additional power <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> was provided by a cylinder of compressed air which was re-charged by small air pumps activated by vibrations of the chassis and the brakes and by igniting oxyhydrogen gas. No production beyond the prototype was reported.|$|E
25|$|The i3 {{allows the}} owner <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> from a {{conventional}} socket. The BMW i3 {{has a number}} of charging functions. AC fast charging can take less than 3 hours {{with the use of the}} BMW i Wallbox Pure or any 3rd party charging equipment (EVSE) supporting 32A, when charging from 0 to 80%. The i3 also has a rapid charging option suitable for public DC charging stations and can take less than 30 minutes to charge from 0% to 80%. In the US, it can also be charged from any public charging station with an SAE J1772 connector. In 2016, BMW and the PG utility in California expanded an experiment of delaying charge-up during peak demand and compensating i3 owners for the delay.|$|E
2500|$|Reports {{emerged in}} late July 2013 of a {{significant}} conflict between the companies responsible for {{the two types of}} charging plugs. The Japanese-developed CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Toyota, while the Society of Automotive Engineers’ (SAE) International J1772 Combo standard is backed by FCA, GM, Ford, Volkswagen, and BMW. Both are direct-current quick-charging systems designed <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> of an electric vehicle to 80 percent in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are completely incompatible. In light of an ongoing feud between the two groups, experts in the field warned that the momentum of the electric vehicle market will be severely affected. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1896, the Armstrong Phaeton was {{developed}} by Harry E. Dey and built by the Armstrong Company of Bridgeport, CT for the Roger Mechanical Carriage Company. Though there were steam, electric, and internal combustion vehicles introduced in the early days, the Armstrong Phaeton was innovative with many firsts. Not only did it have a gasoline powered 6.5-liter, two-cylinder engine, but also a dynamo flywheel connected to an onboard battery. [...] The dynamo and regenerative braking were used <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery.</b> Its electric starter was used 16 years before Cadillac's. The dynamo also provided ignition spark and powered the electric lamps. The Phaeton also had the first semi-automatic transmission (no manual clutch). The exhaust system was an integrated structural component of the vehicle. [...] The Armstrong Phaeton's motor was too powerful; the torque damaged the carriage wheels repeatedly.|$|E
2500|$|Modern HEVs {{make use}} of efficiency-improving {{technologies}} such as regenerative brakes which convert the vehicle's kinetic energy to electric energy <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery.</b> Some varieties of HEV use their internal combustion engine to generate electricity by spinning an electrical generator to either recharge their batteries or to directly power the electric drive motors; this combination {{is known as a}} motor–generator. Many HEVs reduce idle emissions by shutting down the ICE at idle and restarting it when needed; this is known as a start-stop system. A hybrid-electric produces less emissions from its ICE than a comparably sized gasoline car, since an HEV's gasoline engine is usually smaller than a comparably sized, pure gasoline-burning, vehicle and if not used to directly drive the car, can be geared to run at maximum efficiency, further improving fuel economy. (Natural gas and propane fuels produce fewer emissions.) ...|$|E
60|$|Although he {{saw that}} <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> {{with a handful of}} cavalry was to ride to almost certain death, Weissen gallantly led his men forward. The {{infantry}} followed for a short distance but, being taken in flank by a volley from a party of Vendeans, they broke and fled. The cavalry were almost annihilated, and Weissen was desperately wounded, two or three of his men alone riding back.|$|E

25|$|An {{inventor}} from Michigan, USA built {{a street}} legal, licensed, insured, solar charged electric scooter in 2005. It had {{a top speed}} controlled at a bit over 30mph, and used fold-out solar panels <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>the</b> <b>batteries</b> while parked.|$|R
50|$|The {{output from}} the solar cells is not {{sufficient}} to sustain flight.

50|$|A {{vehicle with}} a flat battery can be jump started by the battery of another vehicle or by a {{portable}} battery booster, after which a running engine (but running faster than idle speed) will continue <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery.</b>|$|E
50|$|After this, Nolan finds a {{stray dog}} {{hiding in the}} {{hospital}} and takes care of it. He names the dog Sherlock while also having illusions of talking with his late wife. Nolan goes to the rooftop to find helicopters flying around the building. When he tries to signal one, criminals distract it by shooting at it, demanding to be rescued first. This leaves Nolan furious, but he has to return to his daughter <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> before he can do more. Nolan manages to also find an ambulance on a flooded street outside. He calls for help using the ambulance's radio, but can't wait for a reply when he has to return to the room <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery.</b>|$|E
30|$|Electric Vehicles and Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles/Extended Range Electric Vehicles, when {{operated}} purely on battery power, are locally Zero Emission Vehicles.

50|$|Hybrid {{electric}} buses {{use a combination}} of an electric battery pack and a diesel engine to provide power, and produce around 40% less carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions than traditional diesel engined buses.

50|$|The SeaBubble {{is powered}} by two {{electrically}} driven propellers attached to the rear skids.

50|$|Nolan {{attempts}} to find a spare battery, but has no luck. After running back upstairs and charging the battery, he returns and finds a generator in a flooded basement room, but it is ruined from water, and almost electrocutes him. Nolan barely returns to the room in time <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> again. Despite being awake for over 36 hours without power and running low on food, (his hand cut from cranking the generator), Nolan continues {{to come up with}} more clever ways <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> (i.e. using his foot and later a rod). He also plays games with Sherlock, like playing fetch with him and sharing his lunch meat given to him by one of the hospital cooks.|$|E
50|$|In the K0, K1, and K2 models {{the entire}} {{lighting}} {{system and the}} ignition system were DC-powered. These models require a charged battery to start and run.
