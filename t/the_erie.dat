5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Erie</b> Art Museum is the city's main art gallery, {{located in}} the Old Customshouse on State Street. Its {{collection}} has an emphasis on folk art and modern art and it hosts a popular blues and jazz concert series. <b>The</b> <b>Erie</b> Art Museum also works on public art projects {{in an effort to}} revitalize and improve the city. In 2000, <b>the</b> <b>Erie</b> Art Museum created a project entitled GoFish, similar to CowParade. 95 fiberglass fish were decorated by Erie artists and placed throughout the city. Patrons paid $3,000 for a fish and the proceeds went to Gannon University's Scholarship Fund and <b>the</b> <b>Erie</b> Public Art Endowment Fund. <b>The</b> <b>Erie</b> Art Museum created a similar public art project in 2004 that involved frogs rather than fish. In 2012, <b>the</b> <b>Erie</b> Art Museum began a project to create forty artistic and functional bike racks, designed and created by local artists. The museum's intentions are to add color and interest to downtown Erie and to promote bicycling, encouraging healthy lifestyles and environmental awareness.|$|E

50|$|Even {{before the}} formal merger, {{it led to}} the {{abandonment}} of most of the Lackawanna's mainline trackage between Binghamton and Buffalo. In 1958, the main line of the DL&W from Binghamton west to near Corning, which closely paralleled <b>the</b> <b>Erie's</b> main line, was abandoned in favor of joint operations, while the Lackawanna Cut-Off in New Jersey was single-tracked in anticipation of the upcoming merger. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>Erie's</b> Buffalo, New York and Erie Railroad was dropped from Corning to Livonia in favor of the DL&W's main line. Most passenger service was routed onto the DL&W east of Binghamton, with the DL&W's Hoboken Terminal serving all E-L passenger trains. In addition, a short segment of the Boonton Branch by Garret Mountain in Paterson, New Jersey, was sold off to the state of New Jersey to build Interstate 80. Ultimately, the west end of the Boonton Branch was combined with <b>the</b> <b>Erie's</b> Greenwood Lake Branch, while the eastern end was combined with <b>the</b> <b>Erie's</b> main line, which was abandoned through Passaic, New Jersey. Sacrificed was the Boonton Branch: a high-speed freight line thought to be redundant with <b>the</b> <b>Erie's</b> mainline. This would haunt E-L management less than a decade later (and Conrail management a decade after that).|$|R

5|$|The public {{libraries}} in Erie {{are part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Erie</b> County library system. The Raymond M. Blasco, M. D. Memorial Library, named for its benefactor, opened in 1996.

5|$|During the 1840s and 1850s, {{a flurry}} of railroad-building {{activity}} led to the completion of four separate railroads converging in Erie. A break of gauge between the <b>the</b> <b>Erie</b> and North East Railroad and the Franklin Canal Companyensured that the citizens of Erie profited from the delays necessary to transfer cargo between the lines. When it was proposed in 1853 to standardize the track gauge to allow through traffic, a conflict that became known as <b>the</b> <b>Erie</b> Gauge War ensued. The residents of Erie, who saw it as an affront to their desire that the city become a major lake port, dismantled railroad bridges and tore up railroad tracks in the city {{in an effort to}} prevent the impending standardization. As part of the dispute's settlement, both railroads provided financial support for the construction of <b>the</b> <b>Erie</b> and Pittsburgh and Sunbury and Erie railroads. The Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad acquired the Franklin Canal Company in 1854, and <b>the</b> <b>Erie</b> and North East was merged with the Buffalo and State Line to form the Buffalo and Erie Railroad a few years later. The Sunbury and Erie was renamed the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in 1861. The Pennsylvania Railroad soon acquired the Sunbury and Erie through a 999-year lease and funded completion of the line by 1864.|$|E
5|$|Erie is home {{to several}} {{professional}} and amateur performing-arts groups. The most significant is <b>the</b> <b>Erie</b> Philharmonic, in continuous existence since 1913 (with the exception of an interregnum during World War II).

Combining visual inspections of nine vineyard sites to determine damage levels with GIS mapping of <b>the</b> Lake <b>Erie</b> vineyards to identify sites with similar soil and elevation characteristics allowed <b>the</b> Lake <b>Erie</b> Regional Grape Program to quickly develop and update maps showing potential damage levels by sub-regions in Chautauqua, Cattaraugus and Niagara Counties in New York and Erie County in Pennsylvania...|$|R

5|$|In {{the eastern}} portion of Brighton, NY31 meets I-590 {{by way of}} an {{interchange}} and intersects NY65. From NY65, NY31 continues southeast into the town of Pittsford, passing along the southern fringe of Oak Hill Country Club and paralleling the former right-of-way of the Auburn Road railroad line {{to the village of}} Pittsford. Just inside the village limits, NY31 crosses <b>the</b> <b>Erie</b> Canal once more and intersects the West Shore Subdivision at-grade. In the village center, NY31 intersects NY96. East of NY96, the route crosses over <b>the</b> <b>Erie</b> Canal once again and exits the village. Outside of the village, NY31 parallels I-490 for a short distance across slightly open areas before connecting to the freeway near the Perinton town line at exit26. The route continues east into Perinton, where it traverses <b>the</b> <b>Erie</b> Canal for one final time within the county and crosses NY250 near Perinton Square Mall.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the ensuing}} decades, <b>the</b> <b>Erie</b> Railroad fell into debt {{along with its}} competitor, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. On September 16, 1960, the Interstate Commerce Commission {{approved}} the railroads {{to go forward with}} a merger, creating the new Erie-Lackawanna Railroad on October 15, 1960. The new railroad lasted only 16 years. In 1976, <b>the</b> <b>Erie</b> Lackawanna and several other large railroad companies were merged into the newly formed federal Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). At this point, stations had to fight for survival. The station depot at Harriman has been closed and boarded up since at least 1970. Passenger train service, however, remained intact through the early 1980s.|$|E
