5|$|A {{subsequent}} caldera-forming eruption occurred about 160,000 years ago. It {{formed the}} relatively small caldera that contains the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake. Since the last supereruption, a series of smaller eruptive cycles between 640,000 and 70,000years ago, has nearly filled in <b>the</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> Caldera with 80 different eruptions of rhyolitic lavas {{such as those that}} can be seen at Obsidian Cliffs and basaltic lavas which can be viewed at Sheepeater Cliff. Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of <b>the</b> <b>Yellowstone,</b> where <b>the</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic V-shaped valley, indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by glaciation.|$|E

5|$|Eighteen {{species of}} fish live in Yellowstone, {{including}} the core range of <b>the</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> cutthroat trout—a fish highly sought by anglers. <b>The</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> cutthroat trout has faced several threats since the 1980s, including the suspected illegal introduction into Yellowstone Lake of lake trout, an invasive species which consume the smaller cutthroat trout. Although lake trout were established in Shoshone and Lewis lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. Government stocking operations in 1890, it was never officially introduced into <b>the</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> River drainage. The cutthroat trout has also faced an ongoing drought, {{as well as the}} accidental introduction of a parasite—whirling disease—which causes a terminal nervous system disease in younger fish. Since 2001, all native sport fish species caught in Yellowstone waterways are subject to a catch and release law. Yellowstone is also home to six species of reptiles, such as the painted turtle and Prairie rattlesnake, and four species of amphibians, including the Boreal Chorus Frog.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, {{following}} {{what other}} states did, New York began to assign route numbers to its main thoroughfares. The Albany to Buffalo portion of <b>the</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> Trail, which {{ran through the}} cities of Syracuse and Utica, was assigned the number NY5A. The portion of <b>the</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> Trail southwest of Buffalo and east of Albany became part of NY5, which bypassed Syracuse and Utica to the south. The Buffalo to Albany portion of NY5's original alignment used a new road, Broadway Road, from Buffalo to Avon and the old Cherry Valley Turnpike alignment from Skaneateles to Albany. In between Avon and Skaneateles, NY5 and NY5A overlapped.|$|E
5|$|The Continental Divide of North America runs diagonally {{through the}} southwestern {{part of the}} park.

Other bacteria in <b>the</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. In 2016, researchers from Uppsala University reported the discovery of a class of thermophiles, Hadesarchaea, in Yellowstone's Culex Basin. These organisms are capable of converting carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and oxygen.|$|E

5|$|For {{three months}} in 1985, 3,000 minor {{earthquakes}} were detected in the northwestern section of the park, during what {{has been referred to}} as an earthquake swarm, and has been attributed to minor subsidence of <b>the</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> caldera. Beginning on April 30, 2007, 16 small earthquakes with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in <b>the</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> Caldera for several days. These swarms of earthquakes are common, and there have been 70 such swarms between 1983 and 2008. In December 2008, over 250 earthquakes were measured over a four-day span under Yellowstone Lake, the largest measuring a magnitude of 3.9. In January 2010, more than 250 earthquakes were detected over a two-day period. Seismic activity in Yellowstone National Park continues and is reported hourly by the Earthquake Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey.|$|E
5|$|The Mink {{fire started}} in Bridger-Teton National Forest from {{lightning}} on July 11, and burned north following <b>the</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> River valley, after firefighters forced the fire away from private lands.

5|$|Travels by fur trappers and adventurers, such as Manuel Lisa and Jim Bridger from 1807 to 1840, {{completed}} {{the exploration of}} the region. With the decline of the fur trade in the late 1840s and much of the prized beaver long since made scarce by over-trapping, few white explorers entered the forest over the next few decades. The first federally financed expedition which passed through portions of Shoshone National Forest was the Raynolds Expedition of 1860, led by topographical engineer Captain William F. Raynolds. The expedition included geologist and naturalist Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden and was guided by mountain man Jim Bridger. Though the Raynolds Expedition was focused on exploration of <b>the</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> region, several efforts to enter what later became Yellowstone National Park were impeded by heavy snows across the mountain passes such as Two Ocean Pass. The expedition finally crossed the northern Wind River Range at a pass they named Union Pass and entered Jackson Hole valley to the south of Yellowstone. Hayden led another expedition through the region in 1871. Hayden was primarily interested in documenting <b>the</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> country west of the forest, but his expedition also established that the forest was a prime resource that merited protection. Travels in the forest in the 1880s by later U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who was also a strong advocate of land conservation, as well as by General Philip Sheridan, provided the impetus that subsequently established <b>the</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> Timberland Reserve in 1891, creating the first national forest in the U.S.|$|E

5|$|Large fruitings of {{the fungus}} are often {{associated}} with damage to the host tree, such as that which occurs with burning. A field study conducted in Norway demonstrated that fruit bodies {{were more likely to}} be found in areas that were heavily burned, compared to locations with light to moderate burning where the trees remained viable, or in clearcut areas. Fruiting was much denser in spruce forests—with up to 700–1000 fruitbodies per square meter—than in pine forests, where fruitbodies were sporadic. Fruitbodies grew by the millions in the year following <b>the</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> fires of 1988.|$|E
5|$|One {{large group}} of fires {{was known as the}} Snake River Complex. These fires were in the {{southern}} section of the park, in the headwaters region of <b>the</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> and Snake Rivers. The largest fire in the group was the Shoshone fire which was started by lightning on June 23. The prescribed natural burn policy was still in effect, and at first no efforts were made to suppress this fire. It smoldered with little movement for several weeks, then rapidly started expanding towards the northeast on July 20.|$|E

40|$|Greater Yellowstone {{provides}} a compelling test {{case for the}} emerging concept of ecosystem management on public lands. Containing charismatic natural resources as well as diverse local communities, <b>the</b> Greater <b>Yellowstone</b> region-now {{commonly referred to as}} <b>the</b> Greater <b>Yellowstone</b> Ecosystem-suffers from ecological fragmentation and accelerating development pressures. In 1987 the U. S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service and the U. S. Department of the Interior National Park Service, acting through <b>the</b> Greater <b>Yellowstone</b> Coordinating Committee (GYCC), jointly undertook a widely heralded interagency coordination process, which offered an opportunity to define and institutionalize ecosystem management principles on a regional scale. Confronted with conflicting national and local interests, the GYCC ultimately failed to adopt meaningful ecosystem management goals, leaving the region 2 ̆ 7 s immediate future shrouded in uncertainty. Nonetheless, <b>the</b> Greater <b>Yellowstone</b> experience has helped to refine the concept of ecosystem management and has provided important lessons about the pitfalls of interagency coordination.
