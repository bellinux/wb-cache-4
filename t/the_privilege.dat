5|$|<b>The</b> <b>privilege</b> of peerage {{extends to}} all {{temporal}} peers and peeresses {{regardless of their}} position {{in relation to the}} House of Lords. The right to sit in the House is separate from <b>the</b> <b>privilege,</b> and is held by only some peers (see History of reform of the House of Lords). Scottish peers from the Acts of Union 1707 and Irish peers from the Act of Union 1800, therefore, have <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> of peerage. From 1800, Irish peers have had the right to stand for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons but they lose <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> of peerage for the duration of their service in the lower House. Since 1999, hereditary peers of England, Scotland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom who are not members of the House of Lords may stand for election to the House of Commons. Their privilege of peerage is not explicitly lost by service in the lower House. Any peer issuing a disclaimer under the provisions of the Peerage Act 1963 loses all privileges of peerage. <b>The</b> <b>privilege</b> of peerage also extends to wives and widows of peers. A peeress by marriage loses <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> upon marrying a commoner, but a peeress suo jure does not. Individuals who hold courtesy titles, however, do not have such privileges by virtue of those titles. Lords Spiritual (the 26 Archbishops and Bishops who sit in the House of Lords) do not have <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> of peerage as, at least since 1621, they have been Lords of Parliament, and not peers.|$|E

50|$|Because the Court {{limited the}} {{application}} of <b>the</b> <b>Privileges</b> and Immunities Clause of the Constitution to <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> of non-citizens in foreign United States states and because the Court extremely limited <b>the</b> <b>Privileges</b> or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in the Slaughterhouse Cases, subsequent parties alleging discrimination turned to the Equal Protection Clause.|$|R
2500|$|Rehnquist {{distinguished}} <b>the</b> <b>Privileges</b> and Immunities {{from the}} Dormant Commerce Clause by explaining {{that while the}} Dormant Commerce Clause is a judicially created doctrine to prevent economic protectionism, <b>the</b> <b>Privileges</b> & Immunities Clause is an actual Constitutional text to protect people’s rights. Thus, since the clauses have two distinct purposes, the “market participant” exception {{did not apply to}} <b>the</b> <b>Privileges</b> and Immunities analysis. [...] Camden could pressure public works contractors to hire city residents without running afoul of the Dormant Commerce Clause, but this did not allow the city to escape scrutiny under <b>the</b> <b>Privileges</b> and Immunities Clause. [...] However, Rehnquist went on to explain that <b>the</b> <b>Privileges</b> and Immunities Clause did not bar all potentially discriminatory acts by a state or political subdivision.|$|R

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Privileges</b> and Immunities Clause {{says that}} a citizen of one state is {{entitled}} to <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> in another state, from which a right to travel to that other state may be inferred. Indeed, in the 1982 case of Zobel v Williams, {{a majority of the}} U.S. Supreme Court agreed that <b>the</b> <b>Privileges</b> and Immunities Clause plausibly includes a right of interstate travel.

5|$|Despite such inaccuracies, {{the tale}} has been {{frequently}} repeated. Individual privileges that did exist {{have fallen into}} disuse—for example the Lord of the Manor of Worksop (which is not a peerage) was extended <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> and duty of attending the coronation of the British monarch until 1937, but the right was not exercised at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 as the manor was under corporate ownership at the time.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh was {{formally}} {{established as a}} royal burgh by King David I of Scotland around 1125.

It is probable, therefore, that some form of boundary was constructed around this time, although {{it may have been a}} timber palisade or ditch, rather than a stone wall.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court {{extended}} the standard from Berghuis v. Thompkins in Salinas v. Texas, 570 U.S. ___ (2013), on June 17, 2013, holding that a suspect's silence {{in response to}} a specific question posed during an interview with police when the suspect was not in custody and the suspect had been voluntarily answering other questions during that interview could be used against him in court where he did not explicitly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence in response to the specific question. Of the five justices who concluded that the suspect's silence could be used against him in these circumstances, Justices Alito, Roberts and Kennedy concluded that the defendant's Fifth Amendment claim failed because he did not expressly invoke <b>the</b> <b>privilege.</b> The other two Justices, Thomas and Scalia, concluded that the defendant's claim would fail even if he had invoked <b>the</b> <b>privilege,</b> on the theory that the prosecutor's comment at the trial—regarding the defendant's silence {{in response to a}} question during the police interview—did not compel the defendant to give self-incriminating testimony.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>privilege</b> {{of trial}} by peers was still ill-defined, and the statute did not cover peeresses. In 1442, after an ecclesiastical court (which {{included}} King Henry VI of England, Henry Beaufort and John Kemp) found Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester, guilty of witchcraft and banished {{her to the}} Isle of Man, a statute was enacted granting peeresses the right of trial by peers.|$|E

25|$|In the 1833 case of Barron v. Baltimore, the Supreme Court of the United States {{held that}} the Bill of Rights {{did not apply to}} state governments; such protections were instead {{provided}} by the constitutions of each state. After the Civil War, Congress and the states ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, which included the Due Process Clause and <b>the</b> <b>Privileges</b> or Immunities Clause. While the Fifth Amendment had included a due process clause, the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment crucially differed from the Fifth Amendment in that it explicitly applied to <b>the</b> states. <b>The</b> <b>Privileges</b> or Immunities Clause also explicitly applied to the states, unlike <b>the</b> <b>Privileges</b> and Immunities Clause of Article IV of the Constitution. In the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), the Supreme Court ruled that <b>the</b> <b>Privileges</b> or Immunities Clause was not designed to protected individuals from the actions of state governments. In Twining v. New Jersey (1908), the Supreme Court acknowledged that the Due Process Clause might incorporate some of the Bill of Rights, but continued to reject any incorporation under <b>the</b> <b>Privileges</b> or Immunities Clause.|$|R
5|$|Trade on the {{navigation}} was adequate, {{but the company}} was hampered by the overrun {{in the cost of}} construction. Dividends were paid to shareholders in 1795, 1817, 1818 and 1824, but profits had improved by 1826, and regular dividends were then paid. Between 1836 and 1856, they ranged from five per cent to eight per cent. Rather than the proprietors collecting the tolls, they were let to toll collectors. In 1816, John Keyworth paid £1,010 for <b>the</b> <b>privilege,</b> while by 1839, Joshua Bower had to pay £1,590. This practice ceased in 1851, as receipts fell.|$|E
5|$|While the Self-Incrimination Clause {{primarily}} implicates the law {{of criminal}} investigations, the Clause also protects against self-incrimination that may occur at trial. Plainly, the Clause prevents the government from compelling the defendant to testify against himself or herself at trial. Further, if the defendant chooses to testify, the Clause prevents the state from requiring her to testify first. But, if the defendant testifies, she cannot claim <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination {{within the scope of}} the direct examination.|$|E

In the pact of 1374 (<b>the</b> <b>Privilege</b> of Koszyce), the Polish nobility was granted {{extensive}} concessions and agreed to extend the Anjou succession to Louis's daughters, as Louis had no sons. Louis's neglect of Polish affairs resulted {{in the loss of}} Casimir's territorial gains, including Halych Rus', which was recovered by Queen Jadwiga in 1387. In 1396, Jadwiga and her husband Jagiełło (Jogaila) forcefully annexed the central Polish lands separating Lesser Poland from Greater Poland, previously granted by King Louis to his Silesian Piast ally Duke Władysław of Opole.|$|E
