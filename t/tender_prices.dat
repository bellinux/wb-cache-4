The firm of Hodgen & Hodgen was once again asked to prepare plans, [...] The proposed scheme was for the 1930-31 hall to be replaced with a larger, two-storeyed building with partial basement and roof garden - the basement to contain kitchen and supper room; the ground floor to contain the dance floor; and the upper floor to contain a cafeteria and bar. <b>Tender</b> <b>prices</b> proved prohibitive, so the extensions were modified to contain only a single-storeyed dance hall with basement kitchen and supper room, omitting any new facilities for RSL members. In negotiations with the Toowoomba City Council on this matter in March 1956, Dr Furness, President of the Toowoomba Sub-branch of the RSL, explained that the modified plan was intended for the citizens of Toowoomba, to provide a centrally located dance floor {{which could be used}} for a variety of public functions.

40|$|Construction project risks affect contractors' tender price. A host {{of factors}} {{influencing}} <b>tender</b> <b>prices</b> {{were identified and}} the importance of these factors evaluated by making use of the data collected in a postal questionnaire survey conducted to the ‘Buildings’ contractors in Hong Kong. Out of 60 factors identified, the availability of required cash, uncertainty in costs estimates, urgent need for work, past experience in similar projects and contract size are considered most important. The need for work and the amount of experience are similar to those factors affecting bidding decisions of top UK contractors. The findings suggest that in the upward adjustment of <b>tender</b> <b>prices,</b> the large‐size contractors are more concerned with the uncertainty in costs estimates while the medium‐ and small‐size contractors care more about no past experience. In the downward adjustment of prices, the large size of the contract is the main factor affecting the pricing of the large‐ and medium‐size contractors while the urgent need for work is the main drive for the small‐size ones. There are significant differences between the contractors' perceptions {{of the importance of the}} risk factors. This is consistent with differing attitudes towards bid mark‐up decisions of the large‐ and medium‐size contractors in Singapore. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to establish an econometric model for accurately predicting the <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> movements based on a group of associated financial and macroeconomic variables. Applying Johansen’s method for multivariate cointegration analysis, the <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> was found to be cointegrated with the gross domestic product, construction output and building cost. A vector error correction (VEC) model imposing the cointegration restriction was then developed for the purpose of forecasting. The model was verified against various diagnostic statistical criteria and compared with the Box‐Jenkins and regression models. With a mean absolute percentage error for a three‐year ahead forecast at 2. 9 % level, the developed VEC model outperforms the Box‐Jenkins and regression models, and is proven to be efficient and reliable in forecasting the short‐ to medium‐term <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> movements. The model can assist estimators to predict the TPI pattern in advance, and it can also help the public sector in planning for the construction workload to improve the stability of the construction market. Although the VEC model developed focuses on the Hong Kong construction market, the econometric technique can be applied to modelling other economic variables.

We will analyze a small enterprise in stonecutting industry and one of their projects. We presume that only financially successful companies can survive on the long term. In order to achieve that, companies {{need to have a}} good understanding and overview of their operational costs, good knowledge of preparing calculations and comparing estimated to actual costs. Only in this case, it is possible to have a good overview of the financial performance. Small enterprises face an issue as calculations and costs are often neglected and employees do not have enough skills in this field. The entrepreneur is not specialized in preparing calculations which are often compiled on the basis of experience instead of actual computations. Additionally, small businesses do not have enough funds to purchase the specialized software for computing the calculations and therefore later are mostly carried out by using more general tools such as Microsoft Excel.

In this paper, we address this question by formulating a nonstandard model of takeovers of diffusely held firms. It is demonstrated that, even when individual shareholdings are infinitesimal relative to firm size, takeovers succeed with positive probability and equilibria exist in which the raider earns substantial per share profits. Further, the Nash equilibria of the game are characterized with regard to raider profit, the aggregate fraction of shares tendered, and the relation between raider profit and the degree of randomization exhibited by shareholder tendering strategies.

40|$|Abstract: An {{important}} {{process in}} the procurement of infrastructure is tendering. Tendering involves invitation to submit tender by clients or their representative, submission of required documents by contractors and selection of appropriate contractors to execute the project. This study examines important constituents of <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> submitted by a contractor and factors affecting their <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> in Nigeria {{with a view to}} improving their competitiveness and success rate locally and internationally. Using quantitative design approach, data were obtained through questionnaires administered on registered construction professionals and contracting firms with adequate practicing experience. Prior to the study, pilot study was carried out to ensure proper validity and reliability of the instrument. From the final survey, there is no significance difference in the significance, importance and level of contractors' awareness of constituents of <b>tender</b> <b>price.</b> This implies that contractors are conversant of important elements of their <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> but the major factors affecting this price are related to incorrect/incomplete design as well as buildability and technicality associated the project.

40|$|Construction {{activity}} in Kenya fluctuates excessively and grows very slowly. This feature causes {{adverse effects on}} the construction industry. When a drastic fall in construction activity occurs, the industry loses its production capacity; manpower moves to other industries {{in the country and}} abroad and many construction firms go bankrupt. During recovery, the shortage of contractors leads to increase in <b>tender</b> <b>prices</b> and sometimes poor quality work. These problems are best understood by modelling the construction industry as a system, because the systems approach to problem resolution involves an overarching study of the forces that give rise to the problems while simultaneously avoiding the distractions arising from excessive scrutiny of the problems themselves. In this paper, a system dynamics study of the construction industry of Kenya is presented. The system archetypes underlying the problematic behaviour of the industry are observed to be the balancing process with a delay phenomenon, coupled with the limits to growth phenomenon. It is recommended that (1) regulation of the response of the industry to changes in demand for its services; and (2) expansion of the construction market, could minimize fluctuations in construction activity and foster continual growth of the {{activity in}} Keny...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of transparency and openness to competition in public procurement in the Czech Republic. The problems of the Czech procurement market have been demonstrated on the analysis of a sample of contracts awarded by local government entities. From among a set of factors influencing the efficiency of public procurement, we closely analyse transparency, resilience against corruption, openness, effective administrative award procedure, and formulation of appropriate evaluation criteria for selecting the most suitable bid. Some assumptions were confirmed, including a positive effect of open procedures {{on the level of}} competition on the supply side as well as the dominant use of price criteria only. The latter case is probably often caused by low skills of workers at the contracting entities, as well as the lack of resources in public budgets. However, we have to reject the persistent legend of “undershooting” <b>tender</b> <b>prices</b> and subsequently increasing the final prices of public contracts. Increases of final prices are very limited. Based on the results of the analyses presented, we argue that the main problem of the Czech public procurement market lies in a rather low competence of administrators who are not able to use non-price criteria more often...|$|E

40|$|The {{focal point}} {{of this study was}} to assess the {{perspectives}} of construction professionals on factors influencing <b>tender</b> <b>prices</b> of construction works and the contribution of the factors to the success rate of contractors. Using literature review and questionnaire survey, 15 factors were identified in respect to contractors' tender price and success rate in Nigeria. The findings of this study based on the results of statistical analyses (mean score and chi-square) reveal that all the construction professionals (architects, builders, engineers and quantity surveyors) are of the opinion that material availability, labour productivity and level of profit are the most significant factors that highly influence tender price of construction works and consequently affect the success rate of contractors in competitive bidding. Project definition and construction plan have least influence on contractors' tender price. Also, it was found that government policy does not have significant effect on contractors' success rate in competitive bidding in Nigeria. It is hoped that the information presented in this paper will be of interest to all parties concerned, including Nigerian construction companies and foreign companies planning to enter the Nigerian construction market.
