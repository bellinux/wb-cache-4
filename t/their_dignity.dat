5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain <b>their</b> <b>dignity</b> and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{the great}} {{majority}} of the cardinals are archbishops of the main metropolitan dioceses of the world and reside in their countries. Apart from the exclusive right of the election of the new pope, <b>their</b> <b>dignity</b> is purely honorific. However, originally the College of Cardinals was simply a college of the clergy of the City of Rome, constituted of the bishops of the seven dioceses (called suburbicarian sees) bordering the diocese of Rome (cardinal-bishops), priests of the parochial churches of Rome (cardinal-priests) and deacons heading the ecclesiastical regions of the city of Rome (cardinal-deacons). Unlike today, the cardinals had real jurisdiction over the dioceses, parochial churches (called tituli) or deaconries to which they were attached. The phenomenon of the external cardinalate in the late Middle Ages constituted the first exception to the rule, that cardinals – members of the clergy of the diocese of Rome – cannot serve simultaneously in another, external church, which is now common practice.|$|E

500|$|As {{the nature}} of the new [...] "factory system" [...] became clear, however, many women joined the broader American labor movement, to protest the {{dramatic}} social changes being brought by the Industrial Revolution. While they decried the deteriorating factory conditions, worker unrest in the 1840s was directed mainly against the loss of control over economic life. This loss of control, which came with the dependence on the corporations for a wage, was experienced as an attack on <b>their</b> <b>dignity</b> and independence. In 1845, after a number of protests and strikes, many operatives came together to form the first union of working women in the United States, the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association. The Association adopted a newspaper called the Voice of Industry, in which workers published sharp critiques of the new industrialism. The Voice stood in sharp contrast to other literary magazines published by female operatives, such as the Lowell Offering, which painted a sanguine picture of life in the mills.|$|E

500|$|The {{policy which}} would, some 30years later, {{come to be}} called the [...] "Monroe Doctrine" [...] was {{contained}} in the President's annual message to Congress on December2, 1823. [...] It warned European nations against new colonial ventures in the Americas, and against interference with Western Hemisphere governments. [...] The doctrine had little practical effect at the time, as the United States lacked the ability to enforce it militarily and most European powers ignored it, considering it beneath <b>their</b> <b>dignity</b> even to respond. [...] When Britain and other powers seized additional land in the Guianas in the 1830s, the United States did not issue a formal protest. [...] The Mexican–American War of 1846–1848 increased Latin American suspicions over the doctrine, as many south of the border felt that the American purpose in warning European powers to keep out was to reserve the land for itself. [...] Nevertheless, the Monroe Doctrine became an important part of United States foreign policy {{in the second half of}} the 19th and into the 20thcentury.|$|E

By the mid-1990s, however, 75% of women aged 18-24 had experienced cunnilingus. Music videos by female artists have contributed to the trend, with both Mary J. Blige and Janet Jackson heavily implying male-on-female oral sex in music videos by pushing down on a man's head until he's in exactly the right position." [...] Similarly, Paula Kamen in Her Way: Young Women Remake the Sexual Revolution (2000) states that [...] "n the early to mid-1990s, oral sex even reached mainstream music as politically charged demand of truly liberated women," [...] citing TLC, Mary J. Blige and Janet Jackson as examples of female artists simulating cunnilingus in their videos. Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "she celebrated becoming an erotic being... young women a way to have their sexual freedom and <b>their</b> <b>dignity,</b> to have their cake and eat it too." [...] She was named Best Female Singer and Female Sex Symbol by Rolling Stone for the year 1993 in pop music. Goren adds that later pop stars such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Pink would rely on image, sex appeal and choreography as much as musical talent.|$|E

500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{said of the}} Pink Panther films, [...] "I'm {{not sure}} why Mr. Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team, {{though it may be}} because each is a fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all-consuming, epic {{self-absorption}} that makes slapstick farce initially acceptable—instead of alarming—and finally so funny." [...] Film critic Elvis Mitchell has said that Sellers {{was one of the few}} comic geniuses who was able to truly hide behind his characters, giving the audience no sense of what he was really like in real life. A feature of the characterisations undertaken by Sellers is that, regardless of how clumsy or idiotic they are, he ensured that they always retain <b>their</b> <b>dignity.</b> On his playing of Clouseau, Sellers said: [...] "I set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because I feel that he thinks he is probably one of the greatest detectives in the world. The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot. I thought a forgivable vanity would humanise him and make him kind of touching." [...] His biographer, Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, Sellers is [...] "the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they are." [...] Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers's performances in the Pink Panther films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment. Wesson considers that [...] "As 'low' and 'high' comedy rolled into one, it's the performative counterpoint to Edwardian sophisticated naturalism". This combination of [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low", exemplified by Clouseau's attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within the film Clouseau was [...] "the sole representative of humanity". Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that Sellers had a [...] "balance between character and absurdity". Richard Attenborough also thought that because of his sympathy, Sellers could [...] "inject into his characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being".|$|E
