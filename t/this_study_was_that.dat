2500|$|A {{high-throughput}} study, which denotes {{technology that}} looks at extensive genetic markers, focused on epigenetic differences between monozygotic twins to compare global and locus-specific changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications {{in a sample of}} 40 monozygotic twin pairs. In this case, only healthy twin pairs were studied, but a wide range of ages was represented, between 3 and 74 years. One of the major conclusions from <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there is an age-dependent accumulation of epigenetic differences between the two siblings of twin pairs. This accumulation suggests the existence of epigenetic “drift”. Epigenetic drift is the term given to epigenetic modifications as they occur as a direct function with age. While age is a known risk factor for many diseases, age-related methylation ...|$|E

2500|$|Jonathan Potter, the {{director}} of the Clinical Effectiveness and Evaluation Unit of the Royal College of Physicians stated in 2009 that their audits showed that [...] "where the Liverpool Care Pathway for the dying patient (LCP) is used, people are receiving high quality clinical care in the last hours and days of life". The 2009 audit looked at end-of-life care in 155 hospitals, and examined the records of about 4,000 patients. A major criticism of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> each of the participating hospitals was only asked to submit datasets from 30 patients: arguably, the study was heavily biased by the ability to [...] "cherry-pick" [...] the most favourable datasets, and the lack of availability of all data for independent scrutiny and objective assessment.|$|E

50|$|A {{separate}} randomized placebo-controlled {{study published}} in May 2010 found {{that the difference between}} high-density ion therapy and placebo (dim red light and low-density ions) was not statistically significant.

50|$|During {{his tenure}} as manager, his group {{conducted}} a study of iTunes use, and the zeroconf discovery protocols it relies on, in the workplace whose results were reported in The Washington Post, the San Francisco Chronicle, and other major news agencies.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the provincial {{government}} began to examine duplication of municipal services in Nova Scotia. One of the recommendations arising from <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> all of Cape Breton County be amalgamated.

40|$|Critical theory, social constructivism and {{transformative}} learning {{were used}} to examine how and in what ways mid-career workers who experience job loss learn how to acquire new passion for life through their work. Findings of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> participants who lost their jobs found new passion in life through work because {{they were able to}} construct their identities independent of the hegemonic influences of corporate managers. The implication of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> adult education can be used to help people redefine their self-concepts and social concepts, following job loss, and that both of these can lead to positive social change...|$|R

30|$|An {{important}} {{achievement of}} the algorithms developed and tuned for <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they can solve a nonlinearly constrained problem in less than 2  s (e.g., ABC, GA and HS in Case 1).|$|R
50|$|A 2006 study {{revealed}} the intentional breakage and cutting of various human elements, particularly skulls. Bones were broken with stone tools in a peri-mortem state, {{as is evident}} by the fragmentation patterns on the bones, which differ between fresh and dry (old) conditions. The conclusion reached from <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the site of Herxheim was a ritual mortuary center - a necropolis - where {{the remains of the}} dead were not just buried, but for reasons unknown, destroyed.|$|E
50|$|In a study {{conducted}} in Tamil Nadu, 29% of women and 58% of men attending an outpatient clinic were aware of AIDS/STDs, however only 12% of women and 26% of men attending an STD clinic were aware of AIDS. The conclusion from <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> mass media had been more effective at disseminating information about HIV/AIDS than the radio. However, this study also showed that mothers were not knowledgable about Mother-to-Infant transmission because the information hadn't filtered down to them.|$|E
50|$|Burt Rutan {{then started}} a {{two-phase}} program. The first phase was the preliminary design of LCBAA, {{while in the}} second phase the Long EZ aircraft was developed to serve as a technology demonstrator. The original layout suggested by <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of a low wing, cantilever configuration, aircraft powered by a pusher turboprop, and also suggested the aircraft be built around a 30 mm Gatling gun capable of destroying most light armored vehicles. It was decided that as much military hardware as possible would be used in the design.|$|E
30|$|The main {{limitation}} of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we <b>were</b> {{not able to}} generate substantial interaction between participants and development team representatives.

Their conclusion was that [...] "the clear result of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the McMinnville UFO was a model hanging from a thread." ...|$|E
50|$|He {{used the}} {{corrective}} campaign by the FTC as {{the attack on}} the positive attitude toward Chevron. The results indicated that a supportive treatment offered less resistance than a refutational treatment. The other discovery was that when an inoculative treatment is received, but no attack is followed there is a drop in attitude. One of the major limitations in <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Hunt did not allow a time elapse between the treatment and the attack. Which is a major element from McGuire’s original theory. (McGuire, 1961) Since this publication, there has been more research conducted in marketing and advertising as well. The future applications in marketing are far more promising than they were in 1987.|$|E
50|$|There is data {{to support}} that some genes {{contribute}} to substance dependence. Some {{studies have focused on}} finding genes that predispose the person to be dependent on marijuana, cocaine, or heroin by studying genes that control a person's dopamine and opioid receptors, but no conclusive findings were reported. Other researchers found a connection between dopamine receptor genes and dependency on a substance. A potential problem with <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> alcohol is commonly used with another substance, so {{the results of the study}} may not have been caused by dependency on a single substance. This means that multiple substances may have been contributing to the results, but the researchers suggested that further research should be done.|$|E
30|$|The null {{hypotheses}} for <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> (1) there <b>is</b> {{no significant}} difference about occurrence of canine displacement in subjects with dental agenesis compared with a control group and (2) hypodontia {{does not have a}} role in maxillary canine impaction.|$|R
40|$|Background: The main {{hypothesis}} of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> oral heme iron polypeptide (HIP; Proferrin (R) ES) administration will more effectively augment iron stores in erythropoietic stimulatory agent (ESA) -treated peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients than conventional oral iron supplementation (Ferrogradumet (R)) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{being tested}} in <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> different placement locations and forces applied on the novel N 2 mini-implants can translate into different types of maxillary protraction.
