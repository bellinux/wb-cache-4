5|$|The local nurses' {{union for}} the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital is on strike. Jeff, {{the husband of}} Deb (Chad Morgan), one of the nurses, collapses while walking the picket line. At the {{emergency}} room, House suspects Jeff's extreme niceness and inability to get angry is a major symptom of an underlying condition. After various tests, the team suspects his niceness is a personality change resulting from syphilis. Kutner (Kal Penn) asks the couple if either of them had an affair, {{which could lead to}} syphilis. Deb denies it, stating <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the way her husband behaves and that it is impossible for her to not love him.|$|E
5|$|Lana {{attempts}} to convince everyone <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a rumour by dating Brendan Bond (Michael Wahr). When Sky {{finds out that}} Lana is planning {{to have sex with}} Brendan during a party, Sky tries to stop her. Lana tells Sky to leave, but then decides to tell Brendan that she cannot have sex with him because she likes girls. Lana receives anonymous notes in her locker praising her for being brave. However, she is also targeted by a gang of girls who threaten to cut her hair off. Susan decides to get the school involved in a tolerance campaign, but many of the parents protest about it. Sky and Lana begin drawing a cartoon strip together called Freak Girl and The Enigma and Buffy Only (Laura Gordon), the editor of a gay magazine, becomes interested in publishing it. Buffy later asks Lana out on a date, but comes to realise that they are not right for each other.|$|E
5|$|The Minister can declare any fence or barrier {{surrounding}} {{a part of}} a security area to be a perimeter fence. The Commissioner of Police is permitted to take steps to prevent people from crossing the fence or passing articles over, through or under the fence, including defensive measures that involve or may involve danger to life. If the measures are taken in a place other than on, under or within the perimeter fence, the Commissioner must take precautions – including displaying prominent warning signs – to ensure that people do not accidentally enter the area. If anyone is injured or dies {{as a result of a}} defensive measure, no compensation is payable unless the Minister certifies <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> and equitable for such compensation to be paid. It is an offence to cross or attempt to cross, or pass or attempt to pass any article over, though or under a perimeter fence except at an authorized entry point; and to damage, attempt to damage or tamper with any fence or any gate or movable barrier at an entry point.|$|E

25|$|Currently, the {{controversy}} with the scheme {{has to do}} with the proposed one-time premium payment. This idea was included in the ruling party's manifesto. The promise has so far not come into fruition as the date for its implementation is constantly postponed. Many critics of the proposal claim <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> not possible to support the scheme with a one-time premium since the sustainability of the scheme would not be possible if premiums were not paid yearly.|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} little known in cultivation. Tony Cavanagh and Margaret Pieroni rate its foliage as {{attractive}} and its flowers as showy, and state <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as attractive {{as many other}} large shrubs in its series. The species prefer heavy soils with good drainiage, and tolerates full sun or light shade. It has good tolerance for both drought and frost. Germination of seed {{appears to have a}} success rate of only about 50%; germination is rapid, often taking less than four weeks.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, indeed! Why should he? He <b>just</b> said <b>it</b> {{probably}} <b>was</b> a lioness, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{as well to}} let her alone. He knows I'm no chicken." ...|$|R
25|$|In the 1970s, Helen Singer Kaplan {{added the}} {{category}} of desire to the cycle, which she argued precedes sexual excitation. She stated that emotions of anxiety, defensiveness {{and the failure of}} communication can interfere with desire and orgasm. In the late 1980s and after, Rosemary Basson proposed a more cyclical alternative to what had largely been viewed as linear progression. In her model, desire feeds arousal and orgasm, and is in turn fueled {{by the rest of the}} orgasmic cycle. Rather than orgasm being the peak of the sexual experience, she suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> one point in the circle and that people could feel sexually satisfied at any stage, reducing the focus on climax as an end-goal of all sexual activity.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Susan became {{involved}} with Tom Scully (Andrew Larkins), a Priest. Susan and Tom caused a scandal when they began a relationship. Television critic Andrew Mercado said that 2004 went down as [...] "a watershed year for controversy" [...] after Susan had sex with Tom. Woodburne told Jackie Brygel from TV Week {{that it was a}} [...] "very hot affair". Tom left the priesthood for Susan and she confessed her love for him. However, the relationship soon ended. Woodburne commented [...] "It becomes apparent to both of them <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> not meant to be. They both reach a period in their life when they are feeling low and lonely and aren't feeling very good about themselves. They just realise that there is no future." [...] Tom returned in 2007 and he became Principal of Erinsborough High. He told Susan that he never stopped loving her and wanted her back. However, by then she was back with Karl.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{begins with}} the Simpson family {{watching}} a news broadcast in which the news anchor Kent Brockman calls the United States Army a [...] "kill-bot factory". Mirkin {{said this was a}} joke the staff [...] "particularly loved to do" [...] because it pointed out how negative and mean-spirited news broadcasts can be, and how they are seemingly [...] "always trying to scare everybody" [...] by creating panic and depression. In one scene in the episode, Marge begins hallucinating after drinking from Springfield's water supply, which has been spiked with LSD by Springfield's rival town, Shelbyville. The Fox network's censors wanted the scene to be cut from the episode because they did not like the idea of Marge [...] "getting high" [...] on LSD. Mirkin, however, defended the scene and argued Marge was not [...] "doing it on purpose", so the censors ultimately allowed the scene to remain in the episode. In another scene, Homer becomes frustrated at God for not getting the tickets to the game, so yells at a waffle stuck to the ceiling that he believes is God. Marge points out to him, however, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a waffle that Bart threw up there. This scene, inspired by some melted caramel stuck to the ceiling of the Simpsons writers' room, is one of Mirkin's and Richardson's [...] "all time favorite" [...] jokes.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's a great scheme," [...] he said hesitatingly. [...] "I suppose {{last night}} it {{occurred}} to you <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a trifle--eh?--just a trifle vulgar?" [...] he asked tentatively.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{heard the}} stableman tell him. Couldn't you say I {{came here with}} you; that we <b>were</b> here together; <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a little freak of ours? Oh, do!" ...|$|R
500|$|The EarthBound fan {{community}} at Starmen.net coalesced {{with the intent}} to have Nintendo of America acknowledge the Mother series. 1UP.com described their intent as reasonable given the company's [...] "frequent dismissal" [...] of the series alongside the community's [...] "monumental efforts to increase American EarthBound awareness". Young felt that their [...] "underdog status" [...] kept Starmen.net vigilant. He also said that he views the community as [...] "a big group of friends having fun together" [...] and sometimes thinks <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> happenstance that EarthBound was what brought them together, as opposed to another franchise like Pokémon. As the site started in 1999, the community started a petition to have Nintendo release Mother for the Game Boy Color, and collected 1850 physical signatures to this end and bound it in a book for Nintendo. The final word from Nintendo was that the package was received. Other petitions include the 2000 10,000-person petition for a North American Mother 3 release on the Nintendo 64, the 2003 31,000-person petition for a North American Mother 1+2 Game Boy Advance release, and letter and phone campaigns. A source internal to Nintendo later told them that the 2003 campaign was almost successful, but fell out of consideration as the phone campaign ended after a week. The community resolved to never let up again.|$|E
500|$|Lisa visits Smithers, {{owner of}} the world's largest Malibu Stacy collection, and asks for help in finding Lovell, who was ousted from the Malibu Stacy company in 1974. Lisa bikes to Lovell's house and plays one of the doll's phrases over the intercom. The gate {{immediately}} opens. Lisa and Lovell decide {{to create a new}} talking doll, Lisa Lionheart, voiced by Lisa herself. The doll is quietly released, but the executives of Malibu Stacy have a meeting in which they agree that Lisa's doll is a real threat because it might hurt the sales of their doll. Meanwhile, Grampa struggles with his new job at Krusty Burger, suffering a war flashback at the drive-in and losing his false teeth making burgers. He soon becomes angry at the way seniors are treated, and quits. After a slow initial release, Lisa Lionheart suddenly gains popularity among the fans of Malibu Stacy after being featured in Kent Brockman's news show. At the mall, as kids, and Smithers, rush out to buy Lisa Lionheart, a cart of Malibu Stacy dolls with new hats is wheeled right into the path of the group running for the Lionheart display. Lisa appeals to them <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the same doll with a [...] "stupid, cheap" [...] hat, but they all prefer to stick with Malibu Stacy, largely due to the encouragement of Smithers, except for one little girl, who leaves with a Lisa Lionheart doll. Despite the fact that the doll is a failure, Lisa takes heart that her message was able to get through to at least one little girl.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with many}} other aspects of yagura and their history, the {{etymology}} of the name is unclear.

2500|$|After reading {{too many}} manuscripts about occult {{conspiracy}} theories, three vanity publisher employees (Belbo, Diotallevi and Casaubon) invent their own conspiracy for fun. They call this satirical intellectual game [...] "The Plan". The three become increasingly obsessed with The Plan, and sometimes forget <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a game. Worse still, other conspiracy theorists learn about The Plan, {{and take it}} seriously. Belbo finds himself {{the target of a}} real secret society that believes he possesses the key to the lost treasure of the Knights Templar.|$|E

2500|$|.....people address {{themselves}} {{to this story}} {{in one or more}} [...] interpretations. They then accept or reject them. Now they can feel happy; they have arrived at an opinion about the matter. According to their conditioning they produce the answer. Now look at their answers.

Others <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a tale copied by Rumi from Sanai – and so on.|$|E
2500|$|Compensation under NZBORA is {{discretionary}} and the Supreme Court of New Zealand has emphasised <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> one of {{many public}} law remedies and that non-monetary remedies will often be more appropriate. Indeed, there are relatively few examples of where compensation for violations of NZBORA have been awarded. In Udompun v Attorney General, Glazebrook J of the Court of Appeal stated that monetary compensation will not be awarded where a more suitable remedy exists. Most significantly, in Taunoa v Attorney-General the Supreme Court of New Zealand awarded compensatory damages for breaches of NZBORA by the Department of Corrections’ Behaviour Management Regime.|$|E
