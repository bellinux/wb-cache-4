500|$|It was Scalia's {{view that}} clear lines of {{separation}} among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches follow {{directly from the}} Constitution, with no branch allowed <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>powers</b> granted to another branch. In his early days on the Court, he authored a powerful—and solitary—dissent in 1988's Morrison v. Olson, in which the Court's majority upheld the Independent Counsel law. Scalia's thirty-page draft dissent surprised Justice Harry Blackmun for its emotional content; Blackmun felt [...] "it could be cut down to ten pages if Scalia omitted the screaming". Scalia indicated that the law was an unwarranted encroachment on the executive branch by the legislative. He warned, [...] "Frequently an issue of this sort will come before the Court clad, so to speak, in sheep's clothing... But this wolf comes as a wolf".|$|E

2500|$|The resolutions {{opposed the}} federal Alien and Sedition Acts, which {{extended}} {{the powers of}} the federal government.

Therefore, the federal government had no right <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>powers</b> not specifically delegated to it. If the federal government assumed such powers, its acts could be declared unconstitutional by the states. So, states could decide the constitutionality of laws passed by Congress.

2500|$|During the Adams presidency, the Federalists {{rebuilt the}} military, levied new taxes, and enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson {{believed}} that these laws {{were intended to}} suppress Democratic-Republicans, rather than prosecute enemy aliens, and considered them unconstitutional. To rally opposition, he and James Madison anonymously wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, declaring {{that the federal government}} had no right <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>powers</b> not specifically delegated to it by the states. The resolutions followed the [...] "interposition" [...] approach of Madison, in which states may shield their citizens from federal laws that they deem unconstitutional. Jefferson advocated nullification, allowing states to invalidate federal laws altogether. Jefferson warned that, [...] "unless arrested at the threshold", the Alien and Sedition Acts would [...] "necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the period}} between the American Revolution and the {{ratification}} of the United States Constitution, the states had united under a much weaker federal government and a much stronger state and local government, pursuant to the Articles of Confederation. The Articles gave the central government very little, if any, authority to overrule individual state actions. The Constitution subsequently strengthened the central government, authorizing it <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>powers</b> deemed necessary to exercise its authority, with an ambiguous boundary between the two co-existing levels of government. In the event of any conflict between state and federal law, the Constitution resolved the conflict via the Supremacy Clause of Article VI {{in favor of the}} federal government, which declares federal law the [...] "supreme Law of the Land" [...] and provides that [...] "the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding." [...] However, the Supremacy Clause only applies if the federal government is acting in pursuit of its constitutionally authorized powers, as noted by the phrase [...] "in pursuance thereof" [...] in the actual text of the Supremacy Clause itself (see above).|$|E
2500|$|Since {{these changes}} {{gave him an}} {{unprecedented}} ability to coerce citizens, he risked damaging his popularity. To compensate for this risk, he had his tribunician powers (potestas tribunicia) modified. The Tribunate was a natural fit for an autocrat who sought to maintain popularity with the people. The Tribunate was a popular office, {{because it had been}} the principal vehicle through which plebeians gained political power and through which they had been protected against the abuses of the state. The [...] "Plebeian Tribunes" [...] had strong positive powers, such as the right to convene the Plebeian Council, and strong negative powers, such as the right to veto an act of the senate. In addition, by history and precedent, the Tribunate, unlike the Consulship, was radical by nature. Augustus' modifications didn't change the actual powers associated with the office, but instead, Augustus simply displayed his tribunician status more vividly. While he had held tribunician powers since 36 BC, these powers were never renewed. After 23 BC, however, he had these powers renewed every year. In official documents, he indicated the number of years that had elapsed since he first held tribunician power. After these reforms had been instituted, Augustus never again altered his constitution. At various points, the people demanded that he take more powers, but he refused. In a few instances, he had <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>powers</b> that he did not legally have, but he usually acquired these powers by securing the passage of temporary legislation.|$|E

That {{the said}} Hastings did highly {{aggravate}} his offence in discountenancing and discouraging the reëstablishment of magistracy, law, and order, {{in the country}} of Oude, inasmuch as he did in the eighth article of his instructions to the Resident order him <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>powers</b> which ought to have been exercised by lawful magistrates, and in a manner agreeable to law. And in the said article he did state the prevalence of rebellion in the said country of Oude,--as if rebellion could exist in a country in which there was no magistracy, and no protection for life or property, and in which the native authority had no force whatever, and in which he himself states the exercise of British authority to be an absolute usurpation; and he did accordingly direct a rigorous prosecution against the offence of rebellion under such circumstances, but [...] "with a fair and impartial inquiry," [...] when he did not permit the establishment of those courts of justice and magistracy by which alone rebellion could be prevented, or a fair and impartial inquiry relative to the same could be had; and particularly he did instruct the said Resident to obtain the Nabob's order for employing some sure means for apprehending certain zemindars, and particularly three, in the instruction named, whom he, the said Hastings, did cause to be apprehended upon what he calls good information, founded upon some facts to which he asserts he has the testimony of several witnesses, [...] "that they had the destruction of Colonel Hannay and the officers under his command as their immediate object, and ultimately the extirpation of the English influence and power throughout all the Nabob's dominions," [...] and that they did still persevere in their rebellious conduct without deviation, [...] "though the Nabob's, and not our government, was then the object of it"; and he did direct the said Resident, if it should appear, [...] "on a fair and regular inquiry, that their conduct towards the Nabob had been such as it had been reported to be, to insist upon the Nabob's punishing them with death, and to treat with the same rigor every zemindar and every subject who shall be the leader in a rebellion against his authority." ...|$|E

6000|$|Of this, however, he took no care; {{but he was}} not so inattentive to the {{satisfaction}} of the sufferers, either in point of honor or of interest. This was most strongly marked in the case of Mr. Fowke. His reparation to that gentleman, in point of honor, is as full as possible. Mr. Hastings [...] "declared, that he approved his character and his conduct in office, and believed that he might depend upon his exact and literal obedience and fidelity in the execution of the functions annexed to it." [...] Such is the character of the man whom Mr. Hastings a second time removed from the office to which he told the Court of Directors, in his letter of the 3rd of March, 1780, he had appointed him in conformity to their orders. On the 14th of January, 1781, he again finds it an indispensable obligation in him <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>powers</b> [...] "inherent in the constitution of his government." [...] On this principle he claimed [...] "the right of nominating the agent of his own choice to the Residence of Benares; that it is a representative situation: that, speaking for myself alone, it may be sufficient to say, that Mr. Francis Fowke is not my agent; that I cannot give him my confidence; that, while he continues at Benares, he stands as a screen between the Rajah and this government, instead of an instrument of control; that the Rajah himself, and every chief in Hindostan, will regard it as the pledge and foundation of his independence." [...] Here Mr. Hastings has got back to his old principles, where he takes post as on strong ground. This he declares [...] "to be his objection to Mr. Fowke, and that it is insuperable." [...] The very line before this paragraph he writes of this person, to whom he could not give his confidence, that [...] "he believed he might depend upon his fidelity, and his exact and literal obedience." [...] Mr. Scott, who is authorized to defend Mr. Hastings, supported the same principles before your Committee by a comparison that avowedly reduces the Court of Directors to the state of a party against their servants. He declared, that, in his opinion, [...] "it would be just as absurd to deprive him of the power of nominating his ambassador at Benares as it would be to force on the ministry of this country an ambassador from the opposition." [...] Such is the opinion entertained in Bengal, and that but too effectually realized, of the relation between the principal servants of the Company and the Court of Directors.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} focus on civil society {{organizations}} (CSOs) and their capacity <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>power</b> in the employment relationship. In particular, the paper is concerned with identifying the sources of power, how it is exercised and whether CSOs can exert pressure on other employment actors despite their apparent lack of resources possessed by more established representative structures. Design/methodology/approach – Findings are based on 139 completed postal questionnaires and 47 interviews, primarily face-to-face, across 34 different CSOs. Findings – Adopting a resource dependence framework suggests that CSOs have the capacity <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>power</b> and influence key employment actors. However, the power of CSOs is undermined {{by the absence of}} an internal organizational presence, making it difficult to mobilize workers. Research limitations/implications – The research highlights the role of an often-ignored employment actor. To provide further insights {{further research is needed to}} garner the views of other employment participants. Originality/value – In employee relations discussions of workplace power have typically focused on the power of the state, employers and trade unions. This paper adopts a novel angle by exploring the role of CSOs and their ability <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>power...</b>|$|R
