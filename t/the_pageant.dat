Penny arrives at <b>the</b> <b>pageant</b> with Edna, while Wilbur, Seaweed, and the Negro Day kids help Tracy infiltrate the studio. Link breaks away from Amber to dance with Tracy; later, he pulls Seaweed's sister, Little Inez, to the stage to dance in <b>the</b> <b>pageant.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1925, {{runway lights}} were {{installed}} at Penshurst. In 1926, a telephone was again {{made available to}} airmen at Penshurst. On 27 August 1927, Tunbridge Wells Air Pageant was held. The site originally chosen, a field about a mile outside Tunbridge Wells was deemed unsuitable as there were obstacles surrounding it. It was decided to continue <b>the</b> <b>pageant</b> at Penshurst. Five civil de Havilland Moths and three Armstrong Whitworth Siskins from No. 56 Squadron RAF, based at nearby RAF Biggin Hill attended. <b>The</b> <b>pageant</b> was to promote the proposed Tunbridge Wells Flying Club, whose President was to be Sir Robert Gower. It was reported that part of Penshurst Airfield had been rented by the club. Sir Robert entertained Sir Sefton Brancker at Penshurst on 5 December 1927 when Brancker called in {{on his way to}} Lympne Aerodrome where he was to visit the East Kent Flying Club.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, Eric Morley {{organized}} the Festival Bikini Contest, a beauty contest and swimwear advertising opportunity at that year's Festival of Britain. The press, welcoming the spectacle, {{referred to it}} as Miss World, a name Morley registered as a trademark. The winner was Kiki Håkansson of Sweden, who was crowned in a bikini. After the crowning, Håkansson was condemned by Pope Pius XII, while Spain and Ireland threatened to withdraw from <b>the</b> <b>pageant.</b> In 1952, bikinis were banned from <b>the</b> <b>pageant</b> and replaced by evening gowns. As a result of the controversy, the bikini was explicitly banned from many other beauty pageants worldwide. Though some regarded the bikini and beauty contests as bringing freedom to women, they were opposed by some feminists as well as religious and cultural groups who objected to the degree of exposure of the female body.|$|E
5|$|In the {{entertainment}} sector various ploys {{were used to}} attract tourists. In 1920 an annual beauty contest, named <b>the</b> <b>Pageant</b> of Pulchritude (also known as the Miss Universe contest) in 1926, was started in Galveston by C.E. Barfield, manager of a local amusement park owned by the Maceos. The contest was part of Splash Day, the kick-off of the summer tourist season each year, {{and became the first}} international beauty contest, attracting participants from England, Russia, Turkey, and many other nations until its demise in 1932. This contest is said to have served {{as a model for the}} modern Miss America pageant and others. At its height <b>the</b> <b>pageant</b> tripled the island's population the weekend it ran. Even after the international contest's closing, Splash Day was revived in various forms and continued to attract tourists. Other annual events included an extravagant Mardi Gras celebration in spring. The grand Buccaneer Hotel was constructed in 1929 creating an additional hotel landmark to compete with the Galvez (in addition to many other smaller hotel venues).|$|E
5|$|The Miss Gay America is a {{national}} pageant for female impersonators. Established in 1972, <b>the</b> <b>pageant</b> {{is based on the}} Miss America contest and follows a similar format. Owners Michael Dutzer and Rob Mansman presented Gaga with her very own crown and a $5000 check to the Born This Way Foundation for her hard work championing for LGBT rights.|$|E

5|$|The Stretford Pageant is {{an annual}} Rose Queen festival {{held on the}} last Saturday of June; the inaugural pageant was staged in 1919. There is a {{procession}} of decorated floats through the streets, collecting money for local charities and ending at Longford Park, where the Rose Queen is crowned. The tradition of the Rose Queen derives from an earlier event organised by St Peter's Church from 1909 until <b>the</b> <b>pageant</b> began in 1919. Various other entertainments are provided in the park {{on the day of}} <b>the</b> <b>pageant,</b> such as a fun fair and a car boot sale. Stretford Pageant, along with similar events in other parts of Trafford, is under threat because of the council's proposals to reduce funding and support for such events in the future.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), a former NBC page, {{is back at}} NBC and wants to reapply to the page program, but notes {{that it has become}} a pageant. When Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) hears of this, she volunteers to help him win <b>the</b> <b>pageant</b> using her own pageant experience. Jenna treats Kenneth as her mother Verna (Jan Hooks) treated her during her pageant years. After a failed, {{over-the-top}} performance in front of Human resources mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane), Jenna vows to get Kenneth his job back. She goes to Jack to ask him for his help, and Jack orders Jeffrey to hire Kenneth back.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the 2013 Miss America competition, she was a Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) student, where she studied advertising, {{marketing}} and communications with aspirations of a profession related to cosmetic and fragrance marketing. At FIT, she {{was a part of the}} Presidential Honors Program. Her three placements in the Miss New York competition provided her with sufficient scholarship monies to pay for her entire FIT tuition. She trained several different methods to prepare for <b>the</b> <b>pageant.</b> Her trainers included Richard Talens of social fitness network Fitocracy, Sohee Lee, and Mark Fisher of Mark Fisher Fitness. One of her training elements was also CrossFit exercise programs.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, {{businessmen}} in the Washington, D.C. area became involved and greatly expanded {{the program with}} the Christmas Pageant of Peace. <b>The</b> <b>Pageant</b> centered around the lighting of the Christmas tree, and included various elements such as a life-sized reproduction of the nativity scene. Every year from 1954 to 1972, a tree was cut and brought to the White House from a different US state and installed at the Ellipse. The ceremony of the tree lighting was then followed by Christmas presentations through the holiday season.|$|E
5|$|The climax {{takes place}} at the beauty pageant. After a frantic race against the clock the family arrives at the hotel, and are curtly told by a pageant {{organizer}} that they are a couple minutes past the deadline. A sympathetic hired hand instead offers to register Olive on his own time. As Olive prepares for <b>the</b> <b>pageant,</b> the family sees Olive's competition: slim, hypersexualized pre-teen girls with teased hair and capped teeth. They wear lip gloss, adult-like swimsuits, and glamorous evening wear while performing highly elaborate dance numbers with great panache. It quickly becomes apparent that Olive (plain, chubby, wearing large eyeglasses, and untrained in beauty pageant conventions) is a mere amateur by comparison.|$|E
5|$|The seven-minute long video depicts Beyoncé {{playing a}} beauty pageant contest {{representing}} Third Ward, Houston, {{the area in}} which she grew up. It opens with the sound of a poignant piano and shots of Beyoncé sporting short hair, looking at herself in the mirror. It transitions to a segment of her fellow contestants preparing for <b>the</b> <b>pageant</b> backstage, combing their hair, fitting their dresses and analyzing their bodies; one scene during the preparations shows Beyoncé arguing with another contestant over a hair dryer. Multiple shots of the singer follow, of which depict her sitting on a floor and leaving a bathroom after vomiting. The clip then sees contestants looking tired and distressed backstage.|$|E
50|$|Initially, <b>the</b> <b>pageant's</b> winners held <b>the</b> {{title for}} a {{biennial}} period; Yolanda Emiliani Roman, Miss Colombia 1934, held her {{title for the}} longest reign in <b>the</b> <b>pageant's</b> history. <b>The</b> winner of Senorita Colombia represents her country at Miss Universe.

50|$|The {{most obvious}} of these {{characteristics}} is that several of <b>the</b> <b>pageants</b> use a distinctive stanza, sometimes called the Wakefield Stanza (see below). <b>The</b> <b>pageants</b> that manifest <b>the</b> Wakefield Stanza are noted for comedy, social satire, and intense psychological realism. These qualities also show up throughout the Towneley Cycle, most often where it seems to depart from its presumed sources.|$|R
5|$|When the 20-year-old Sue Ellen Shepard {{wins the}} title of Miss Texas in 1967, she meets her future husband, J.R. Ewing, who is a judge for <b>the</b> <b>pageant.</b> After a courtship, they marry on February 15, 1970, but after several years, their {{marriage}} deteriorates, {{due in large part}} to J.R.'s numerous extramarital affairs and his disinterest in her. In 1978, a lonely Sue Ellen begins an affair with J.R.'s nemesis, Cliff Barnes. Shortly thereafter, Sue Ellen finds herself pregnant and believes that Cliff is the father because she and J.R. had been married for years without conceiving, and by this point, they barely had marital relations. Sue Ellen believes she loves Cliff, but is unable to leave J.R. To console herself, she starts drinking heavily during her pregnancy. Worried about the safety of her unborn child, J.R. has Sue Ellen committed to a sanitarium in 1979, to gain sobriety. However, Sue Ellen manages to continue drinking and escapes from the sanitarium drunk and crashes a car. While in the hospital, she gives birth to a son, John Ross Ewing III. After her son's birth, Sue Ellen becomes severely depressed and shows no interest in the child.|$|E
25|$|But {{few other}} {{changes were made}} during {{the latter half of}} the 1990s. In 1995, the National Christmas Tree was lit by solar power for the first time at night, using energy stored during the day. The United States federal {{government}} shutdown of 1995 and 1996 forced the cancellation of <b>the</b> <b>Pageant</b> of Peace beginning December 16, although the National Park Service had enough funds to keep the tree lit through January 1, 1996. The park service also decided to discontinue the display of live deer during <b>the</b> <b>pageant.</b> In 1996, the Office of Surface Mining declined to donate trees for <b>the</b> <b>Pageant</b> of Peace (as it had done for many years). This forced <b>the</b> <b>pageant</b> organizers to purchase cut trees. Pageant organizers also sold 1,950 limited-edition prints and 250 artist's proofs by local artist G. Harvey to raise money for <b>the</b> <b>pageant.</b> Finally, the President's Park unit of the National Park Service began administering the music portion of <b>the</b> <b>pageant.</b>|$|E
