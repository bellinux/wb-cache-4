5|$|It was {{reported}} following Hard Justice that Shane Douglas was originally supposed to handle interview duties for the show, but {{came down with}} the stomach flu {{and was replaced by}} Terry Taylor. Also, that Jeff Hardy missed multiple flights causing him to arrive after the conclusion of the show. Hardy was subsequently suspended for this and past instances of no-showing events. Abyss and Ron Killings were the only ones to receive injuries at Hard Justice. Abyss was given a fairly deep cut on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> from being bashed with a steel chair by Killings that required stitches. Meanwhile, Killings cracked his front teeth after falling face-first onto a steel chair.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1943 Hughes spent nearly a month in Las Vegas, test flying his Sikorsky S-43 {{amphibian}} aircraft, practicing touch-and-go landings on Lake Mead in preparation for flying the H-4 Hercules. The weather conditions at the lake during the day were ideal and he enjoyed Las Vegas at night. On May 17, 1943, Hughes flew the Sikorsky from California carrying two CAA aviation inspectors, two of his employees, and actress Ava Gardner. Hughes dropped Gardner off in Las Vegas and proceeded to Lake Mead to conduct qualifying tests in the S-43. The test flight did not go well. The Sikorsky crashed into Lake Mead, killing CAA inspector Ceco Cline and Hughes employee Richard Felt. Hughes suffered a severe gash on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> when he hit the upper control panel {{and had to be}} rescued by one of the others on board. Hughes paid divers $100,000 to raise the aircraft and later spent more than $500,000 restoring it.|$|E
500|$|He {{was wearing}} a pink t-shirt, {{stonewashed}} jeans, he had a mullet haircut, and he was driving a 280Z, and had yellow drums.

500|$|When {{portrayed as}} a secret agent, Povenmire starts with a similar bread loaf square design, but draws it {{standing}} up vertically and places a fedora on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> which is combined with the square torso. In contrast to his mindless and wild-eyed expression as a pet, the secret agent version of Perry is detailed with eyes [...] "full of steely blue resolve." [...] Povenmire proceeds by drawing his arms, with bare hands that are open and prepared for fighting or any danger. His legs are bent, as well prepared for an act of danger or action needed. Povenmire finishes the design by adding his beaver tail and color.|$|E
500|$|All {{characters}} in Phineas and Ferb were drawn in a design borrowed from Tex Avery's style, with geometric shapes being included in their structure; Phineas {{in particular is}} that of a triangle. The triangle face has been stated in the series as being just his nose that covers the entire head. The goal while drawing characters was to make them simple enough to be drawn by child viewers and be recognized by silhouette. Phineas's eyes lie on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and are of oval shape. For his hair, three [...] "tufts" [...] are put in the back and front, while three freckles lie underneath. For the ear, a small 3 is used to represent the ear lobe. Povenmire uses thin, spindly arms for every character as a simple reason to add fun.|$|E
500|$|There {{were two}} wounds {{to his right}} side, and two to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> which would {{probably}} have resulted in unconsciousness. The {{left side of his}} lip was wounded, his jaw was fractured, and his teeth, neck and larynx were damaged. The pathologist said he [...] "would {{not have been able to}} engage in purposeful talk", according to the Court of Appeal. There were gunshot wounds to his left shoulder and left elbow. The court heard that he had [...] "black eyes and a broken nose, linear bruising to the cheeks, lacerations to the head, linear type bruising to the right forearm, bruising to the left wrist and forearm and three circular burn type marks to the back. The linear marks were consistent with Mr Bamber having been struck with a long blunt object, possibly a gun." [...] One of the pillars of the prosecution case was that Sheila would not have been strong enough to inflict this beating on Nevill, who was 6ft 4in (1.93 m) tall and by all accounts in good health.|$|E

500|$|Many {{aspects of}} Guevara's {{personality}} and beliefs affected the filming process. For instance, close-ups of Del Toro were avoided due to Guevara's belief in collectivism, with Soderbergh remarking, [...] "You can't {{make a movie}} {{about a guy who}} has these hard-core sort of egalitarian socialist principles and then isolate him with close-ups." [...] According to Edgar Ramirez, who portrays Ciro Redondo, the cast [...] "were improvising a lot" [...] while making The Argentine, and he describes the project as a [...] "very contemplative movie", shot chronologically. While filming outdoors, Soderbergh used natural light as much as possible. Del Toro, who speaks Puerto Rican Spanish, tried to speak the best Argentinean Spanish (Rioplatense Spanish) he could without sounding [...] "stiff". Prior to shooting the film's final scenes that depict Guevara's time in Bolivia {{at the end of his}} life, Del Toro shed 35 pounds to show how ill Guevara had become. The actor shaved <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> rather than wear a bald cap for the scenes depicting Guevara's arrival in Bolivia in disguise.|$|E
500|$|The basic {{rectangular}} {{shape of}} Bart's head {{is described by}} director Mark Kirkland as a coffee can. Homer's head is also rectangular (with a dome on top), while spheres are used for Marge, Lisa, and Maggie. Different animators have different methods of drawing Bart. Former director Jeffrey Lynch starts off with a box, then adds the eyes, then the mouth, then the hair spikes, ear, {{and then the rest}} of the body. Matt Groening normally starts with the eyes, then the nose, {{and the rest of the}} outline of Bart's head. Many of the animators have trouble drawing Bart's spikes evenly; one trick they use is to draw one on the right, one on the left, one in the middle, then continue to add one in the middle of the blank space until there are nine. Originally, whenever Bart was to be drawn from an angle looking down so <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> was seen, Groening wanted there to be spikes along the outline of his head, and in the middle as well. Instead, Wes Archer and David Silverman drew him so that there was an outline of the spikes, then just a smooth patch in the middle because [...] "it worked graphically." [...] In [...] "The Blue and the Gray", Bart (along with Lisa and Maggie) finally questions why his hair has no visible border to separate head from hair.|$|E
500|$|Salvatore created Drizzt on {{the spur}} of the moment. He was under {{pressure}} to create a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale series. Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could spell it, and he said [...] "not a chance". Recalling Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said, [...] "I don't know where it came from. I guess that Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in the back of my head. Thank God!" [...] Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many Dungeons & Dragons role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. [...] "I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from Darkwalker on Moonshae and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings." [...] Salvatore calls Drizzt [...] "the classic romantic hero—misunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even when the going gets tough, and getting no appreciation for it most of the time." ...|$|E
