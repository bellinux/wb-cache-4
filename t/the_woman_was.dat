5|$|In 1726, anatomist Nathaniel St André {{claimed to}} have {{delivered}} rabbits from Mary Toft, a woman who lived at No.27 Leicester Square. The event was widely reported around London, attracting interest from King George I and Royal Society president Hans Sloane.

5|$|In {{front of}} a jury, the city's art censor Jeremiah O'Connor testified that September Morn was lewd {{and should not be}} {{displayed}} in public, but rather only in a museum exhibition. W.W.Hallam of the Chicago Vice Committee agreed, arguing that, as <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> committing the illegal act of bathing in public, September Morn had to be banned. Other witnesses for the prosecution included censors, educators, and clergy, such as the superintendent Ella Flagg Young {{and the head of the}} Juvenile Protective Association Gertrude Howe Britton.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Agent Leyla Harrison (Jolie Jenkins) tells Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) about a {{woman who}} stabbed herself repeatedly. Harrison insists that the case is an X-File and that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> killed by monsters that her son Tommy saw. She also {{believes}} that the monster killed the family cat, Spanky. Although Scully dismisses Harrison's claims, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) decide to investigate.|$|E
5|$|Beshear and Abramson easily {{defeated}} Farmer and Williams, carrying 90 of Kentucky's 120 counties. Days later, the Lexington Herald-Leader {{reported that}} Farmer had placed his girlfriend in a non-merit agriculture department job on October 31, 2011. Williams confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> Farmer's girlfriend, but denied knowledge {{that she had}} been put on the state payroll. Farmer defended the hiring, saying his girlfriend was qualified for the job, which involved administrative and clerical tasks, and that his legal team had assured him that he had followed all appropriate hiring regulations. Farmer's successor, Republican James Comer, fired Farmer's girlfriend a day after being sworn into office.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{had begun}} his law {{practice}} dealing primarily with commercial issues but won greater prominence in Cincinnati {{as a criminal}} defense attorney, defending several people accused of murder. In one case, he used a form of the insanity defense that saved the accused from the gallows; <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> instead confined to a mental institution. Hayes also defended slaves who had escaped and were accused under the recently enacted Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. As Cincinnati was just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state, it was a destination for escaping slaves and many such cases were tried in its courts. A staunch abolitionist, Hayes found his {{work on behalf of}} fugitive slaves personally gratifying as well as politically useful, as it raised his profile in the newly formed Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, Miranda Aldhouse-Green of Cardiff University, and the Department of Forensic Science at the University of Århus {{performed}} a re-examination of the Haraldskær Woman. Forensic analysis revealed stomach contents of unhusked millet and blackberries. Her neck had a faint groove {{as if someone}} applied a rope for torture or strangulation. The scientists concluded bog acids caused the swelling of the knee joint and that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> probably already dead before the branches pinned her down. Because of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the examiners guess the Haraldskær Woman {{was a victim of}} ritual sacrifice.|$|E

Behan, who had been resident in Arcidosso for part of the year since 2006, was arrested after seeking treatment twice at a hospital near Arcidosso for a cut on his thigh. In an interview with The Irish Times, he claimed he had first gone to the hospital on 10 July after cutting himself in the thigh while unpacking furniture and other objects delivered from the USA. However, hospital staff had mistakenly decided he had been acting suspiciously due to his poor spoken Italian, {{and the fact that he}} had expressed annoyance at how the hospital was managed and its bad signage.|$|E

5|$|Before Maria's arrival, {{tropical}} storm watches were issued {{for most of}} the Lesser Antilles on September8; the watches were upgraded to {{tropical storm}} warnings at 2230UTC. On the following day, Puerto Rico and many of the U.S. Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands were placed under a tropical storm watch. The watches and warnings for the islands were discontinued around 1500UTC on September10, after the strong thunderstorms diminished from Maria's center. The storm's effects on the island of Puerto Rico were primarily in the form of heavy rainfall. Flood waters near Patillas, Puerto Rico, destroyed several homes and bridges, causing $1.3 million (2011 USD) in damage. In the surrounding city of Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, heavy rainfall flooded and damaged around 150 homes. Many people were forced to relocate after rainfall and mud filled their homes. Near the city of Naguabo, Puerto Rico, the car of a 60-year-old woman was swept away by flood waters on a road. After becoming tangled in bushes, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> {{able to get out of}} her car and pulled to safety. Nearly a month after the storm, U.S. president Barack Obama announced that federal disaster aid would be available to the island due to Maria.|$|E
5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire (and {{elsewhere}} in Central/Eastern Europe), women who killed their newborn could be {{liable to be}} placed in an open grave, and have a stake hammered into their heart. A detailed description of an execution in this manner comes from 17th century Košice (then in Hungary, now in eastern Slovakia). A woman to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants to help him. First, a grave some one-and-a-half ell deep was dug. <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> placed within it, her hands and feet secured by driving nails through them. The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden stave at her heart to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth on the woman, keeping her head free of earth {{at the behest of the}} clerics, however, as to do otherwise would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, the executioner grabbed with a pair of tongs a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden stave, and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in, the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman's head. It is said that a scream was heard, and that the earth actually moved upwards for a moment, before all was over.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Plains Aborigines were matrilineal/matrifocal societies. A man {{married into}} a woman's family after a {{courtship}} {{period during which}} <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> free to reject as many men as she wished. In the age-grade communities, couples entered into marriage in their mid-30s when a man {{would no longer be}} required to perform military service or hunt heads on the battle-field. In the matriarchal system of the Siraya, it was also necessary for couples to abstain from marriage until their mid-30s, when the bride's father would be in his declining years and would not pose a challenge to the new male member of the household. It was not until the arrival of the Dutch Reformed Church in the 17th century that the marriage and child-birth taboos were abolished. There is some indication that many of the younger members of Sirayan society embraced the Dutch marriage customs as a means to circumvent the age-grade system in a push for greater village power. Almost all indigenous peoples in Taiwan have traditionally had a custom of sexual division of labor. Women did the sewing, cooking and farming, while the men hunted and prepared for military activity and securing enemy heads in headhunting raids, which was a common practice in early Taiwan. Women were also often found in the office of priestesses or mediums to the gods.|$|E

5|$|Screen Gems backed Roddenberry's {{first attempt}} at {{creating}} a pilot. His series, The Wild Blue, went to pilot, but was not picked up. The three main characters had names that later appeared in the Star Trek franchise: Philip Pike, Edward Jellicoe, and James T. Irvine. While working at Screen Gems, an actress, new to Hollywood, wrote to him asking for a meeting. They quickly became friends and met every few months; <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> Majel Leigh Hudec, later known as Majel Barrett. He created a second pilot called 333 Montgomery about a lawyer, played by DeForest Kelley. It was not {{picked up by the}} network, but was later rewritten as a new series called Defiance County. His career with Screen Gems ended in late 1961, and shortly afterward, he had issues with his old friend Erle Stanley Gardner. The Perry Mason creator claimed that Defiance County had infringed his character Doug Selby. The two writers fell out via correspondence and stopped contacting one another, though Defiance County never proceeded past the pilot stage.|$|E
5|$|Thalaba {{travels to}} the land of Aloadin, who owns a great garden paradise, and he is invited to feast with the people, but he is unwilling to imbibe alcohol or be taken in by the dancing women that seek to entice him. The temptations {{overwhelm}} him {{to the point where he}} can no longer tolerate them and he flees. Shortly after leaving, he discovers one of the women being attacked by a man wanting to have his way with her. It is revealed that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> Oneiza, who was captured, and that Aloadin was a sorcerer. After saving Oneiza, Thalaba is determined to stop the sorcerer and he ends up killing him. Following this, they are praised by a Sultan that Aloadin wanted to kill, and Thalaba decides to marry Oneiza. Before they can finish their marriage, she dies and Thalaba is left to mourn over her grave. While mourning, a spirit that appears to be Oneiza begins to haunt Thalaba and claim that God disapproves of the young warrior. However, Moath comes and is able to recognise the spirit as a vampire. After killing the vampire, the real Oneiza comes to guide Thalaba onwards.|$|E
5|$|Three Egyptian swimmers, {{one female}} and two males, {{qualified}} for the Olympics. American-born Farida Osman, <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>was</b> {{the youngest member of}} the 2012 national delegation and {{qualified for the}} Games based on having made the Olympic Standard Time in the 50-metre freestyle. In the lead up to the Olympics, she won seven gold medals at the 2011 Pan Arab Games, as well as the 50-metre butterfly title at that year's All-Africa Games and World Junior Championships. In London she was sixth in her heat in the 50-metre freestyle and was eliminated from the tournament, ranking 42nd overall. On the men's side, Shehab Younis qualified for the 50-metre freestyle by meeting the Olympic Selection Time of 22.88 at an international meet in Eindhoven, Netherlands, with a result of 22.85. Prior to the Olympics he had won a bronze medal in the event at the 2011 Pan Arab Games. In London he was third in his heat and 34th overall, failing to advance to the semifinals. Mazen Metwaly, a Saudi-born Egyptian training and studying at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, made the team at an Olympic qualifier in Setúbal, Portugal in June 2012, the second of his two opportunities (his first having been the 2011 World Championships). At the Games, in the marathon 10 kilometre, he was 24th out of 25 competitors.|$|E
