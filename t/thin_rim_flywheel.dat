Bending stresses in <b>thin</b> <b>rim</b> spur gear tooth fillets and root areas {{differ from the}} stresses in solid gears due to rim deformations. Rim thickness is a significant design parameter for these gears. To study this parameter, a finite element analysis was conducted on a segment of a <b>thin</b> <b>rim</b> gear.

40|$|Several young {{supernova}} remnants exhibit <b>thin</b> X-ray bright <b>rims</b> of {{synchrotron radiation}} at their forward shocks. <b>Thin</b> <b>rims</b> require strong magnetic field amplification beyond simple shock compression if rim widths are only limited by electron energy losses. But, magnetic field damping behind the shock could produce similarly <b>thin</b> <b>rims</b> with less extreme field amplification. Variation of rim width with energy may thus discriminate between competing influences on rim widths. We measured rim widths around Tycho's supernova remnant in 5 energy bands using an archival 750 ks Chandra observation. Rims narrow with increasing energy and are well described by either loss-limited or damped scenarios, so X-ray rim width-energy dependence does not uniquely specify a model. But, radio counterparts to <b>thin</b> <b>rims</b> are not loss-limited and better reflect magnetic field structure.

40|$|Two {{groups of}} chondrules in the Murchison CM chondrite, which have {{previously}} been identified {{on the basis}} of FeO in the chondrule grains, are readily identified from cathodoluminescence (CL) and belong to those of the ordinary chondrite group A and B chondrules of Sears et al. (1992 a). All chondrules are surrounded by fine-grained rims containing forsterite with bright red CL, but on group A chondrules an outer <b>thin</b> <b>rim</b> grades into a much thicker rim, with a lower density of forsterite grains, which in turn grades into the central chondrule. Group B chondrules have only the <b>thin</b> outer <b>rim</b> with a high density of small forsterite grains. This is the first time an unequivocal correlation has been observed between chondrule rim thickness and the composition of the object on which the rim is located. We suggest that while all objects in the meteorite (group B chondrules, refractory inclusions, mineral and chondrule fragments, clasts) acquired a very <b>thin</b> <b>rim</b> during processing in a wet regolith, the thick rims on group A chondrules were formed by aqueous alteration of precursor metal- and sulfide-rich rims which are a characteristic of group A chondrules in ordinary chondrites...|$|R

The methodology of checking calculation was suggested for gears {{which are not}} possible to check only by using standard ČSN 01 4686.

The main part of this work is devoted to fatigue crack propagation study in gears with <b>thin</b> <b>rim.</b> Aiding T-stress the influence of constraint and stress multiaxiality on crack propagation was taking into account.

As well as these, mature microglia could be recognized from birth. In semithin, toluidine blue stained sections early glioblasts had large, fair to moderately stained nuclei, and a <b>thin</b> <b>rim</b> of pale cytoplasm; small glioblasts had small, dark nuclei and a rim of darkly stained cytoplasm; large glioblasts had moderately unevenly stained nuclei and a <b>thin</b> <b>rim</b> of moderately stained cytoplasm; and young astrocytes had fairly small nuclei, moderately stained cytoplasm, and one or more processes, which could usually be seen extending for 5 mum or more from the perikaryon. Differential glial counts using the criteria described above, in conjunction with electron microscopic analysis, suggested that early glioblasts gave rise to small glioblasts and large glioblasts; that small glioblasts gave rise directly to astrocytes, large glioblasts, oligodendrocytes and possibly microglia; that large glioblasts formed oligodendrocytes only, and might be immature light oligodendrocytes; and {{that part of the}} microglial population might arise from vascular pericytes...|$|R

40|$|Several young {{supernova}} remnants (SNRs), including SN 1006, emit synchrotron X-rays in narrow filaments, hereafter <b>thin</b> <b>rims,</b> {{along their}} periphery. The widths of these rims imply 50 to 100 μG {{fields in the}} region immediately behind the shock, far larger than expected for the interstellar medium compressed by unmodified shocks, assuming electron radiative losses limit rim widths. However, magnetic-field damping could also produce <b>thin</b> <b>rims.</b> Here we review the literature on rim width calculations, summarizing the case for magnetic-field amplification. We extend these calculations to include an arbitrary power-law dependence of the diffusion coefficient on energy, D ∝ E^μ. Loss-limited rim widths should shrink with increasing photon energy, while magnetic-damping models predict widths almost independent of photon energy. We use these results to analyze Chandra observations of SN 1006, in particular the southwest limb. We parameterize the full widths at half maximum (FWHM) in terms of energy as FWHM ∝ E^m_E_γ. Filament widths in SN 1006 decrease with energy; m_E ∼ - 0. 3 to - 0. 8, implying magnetic field amplification by factors of 10 to 50, above the factor of 4 expected in strong unmodified shocks. For SN 1006, the rapid shrinkage rules out magnetic damping models. It also favors short mean free paths (small diffusion coefficients) and strong dependence of D on energy (μ> 1).

40|$|Results {{of using}} vibration-based methods to detect gear tooth fatigue cracks are presented. An {{experimental}} test rig {{was used to}} fail a number of spur gear specimens through bending fatigue. The gear tooth fatigue crack in each test was initiated through a small notch in the fillet area of a tooth on the gear. The primary purpose of these tests was to verify analytical predictions of fatigue crack propagation direction and rate {{as a function of}} gear rim thickness. The vibration signal from a total of three tests was monitored and recorded for gear fault detection research. The damage consisted of complete rim fracture on the two <b>thin</b> <b>rim</b> gears and single tooth fracture on the standard full rim test gear. Vibration-based fault detection methods were applied to the vibration signal both on-line and after the tests were completed. The objectives of this effort were to identify methods capable of detecting the fatigue crack and to determine how far in advance of total failure positive detection was given. Results show that the fault detection methods failed to respond to the fatigue crack prior to complete rim fracture in the <b>thin</b> <b>rim</b> gear tests.
