50|$|Introduction - Magnetic {{particle}} clutches {{are unique}} in their design, from other electro-mechanical clutches {{because of the}} wide operating torque range available. Like a standard, single face clutch, torque to voltage is almost linear. However, in a magnetic particle clutch torque can be controlled very accurately. This makes these units ideally suited for <b>tension</b> <b>control</b> applications, such as wire winding, foil, film, and tape <b>tension</b> <b>control.</b> Because of their fast response, {{they can also be}} used in high cycle application, such as card readers, sorting machines, and labeling equipment.|$|E
50|$|In an {{electric}} winch system, the wave movement is compensated by automatically driving the winch {{in the opposite}} direction at the same speed. The hook of the winch will thus keep its position relative to the seabed. AHC winches are used in ROV-systems and for lifting equipment that is to operate near or at the seabed. Active compensation can include <b>tension</b> <b>control,</b> aiming to keep wire tension at a certain level while operating in waves. Guide-wires, used to guide a load to an underwater position, may use AHC and <b>tension</b> <b>control</b> in combination.|$|E

50|$|Magnetic {{particle}} brakes {{are unique}} in their design from other electro-mechanical brakes {{because of the}} wide operating torque range available. Like an electro-mechanical brake, torque to voltage is almost linear; however, in a magnetic particle brake, torque can be controlled very accurately (within the operating RPM range of the unit). This makes these units ideally suited for <b>tension</b> <b>control</b> applications, such as wire winding, foil, film, and tape <b>tension</b> <b>control.</b> Because of their fast response, {{they can also be}} used in high cycle applications, such as magnetic card readers, sorting machines and labeling equipment.|$|E
50|$|The {{most basic}} ballheads offer a single control, a <b>tension</b> <b>control,</b> {{which is used}} to tighten or loosen the joint and prevent or allow {{movement}} of the attached device. Higher end heads may offer additional controls. Some have independent panning control, which allow the entire joint mechanism to be rotated horizontally 360Â°, while maintaining the orientation of the ball joint. Other ballheads include an additional control on the joint, called a drag control. This allows the user to set a secondary tension level on the ball, based on the current load, to hold the attached device in place when the <b>tension</b> <b>control</b> is disengaged, while still allowing explicit movements.|$|E
50|$|A <b>tension</b> <b>control</b> bolt (TC bolt) is a {{heavy duty}} bolt used in steel frame construction. The head is usually domed and is not {{designed}} to be driven. The end of the shank has a spline on it which is engaged by a special power wrench which prevents the bolt from turning while the nut is tightened. When the appropriate torque is reached the spline shears off.|$|E

In this paper, we proposed an advanced model predictive control strategy to solving filament winding system time-delay problem. The application of controlled auto-regressive integrated moving-average (CARIMA) model was described the dynamic time-varying character. The parameters of CARIMA model were solved by recursive least squares parameter estimation method through input-output data.

They have thin 0.5 mm (0.02")-thick secondary mirror supports, <b>tension</b> <b>control</b> handles, and the 10" [...] - 12" [...] version {{is made from}} Pyrex glass. They have long, medium, and short focal ratios respectively, in order of increasing aperture. They have white-colored tubes.|$|E
50|$|The {{total weight}} (all-up weight) of the {{installation}} machine comprises: the cable drum and cable; the wrapping mechanism; the motive power unit; the <b>tension</b> <b>control</b> mechanism and the counterweight system. All of these individual components are necessary, but some components {{may be combined}} {{to increase the efficiency}} of the design. For example, those designs using electric motors tend to use the battery pack as part of the counterweight system. Counterweights are required for two separate purposes: to counter the turning moment of the wrapping machine and to balance the cable drum payload.|$|E
50|$|The rewind section {{also has}} options. The main type is centre winding using {{differential}} rewind shafts. These shafts are becoming universal on most slitting machines. The differential shafts ensure an even tension across the full {{width of the}} material. Closed-loop control of the winding tension using feedback from load cells provides the total tension-control system required for running tension-sensitive materials. Precise and accurate <b>tension</b> <b>control</b> {{is the key to}} good roll slitting. Modern machines use AC vector drives with closed-loop feedback from AC motors. When used with the correct control algorithms, they produce excellent results with the minimum of maintenance.|$|E

A two-string bowed lute consisting of a wooden body, traditionally though now rarely a single coconut shell, covered with very fine stretched skin. Two brass strings are tuned a fifth apart and the horse hair bow is tied loosely (unlike modern Western stringed instruments) with the proper <b>tension</b> <b>controlled</b> by the players bow hand, contributing to the difficult technique. There are typically two per ensemble, one for pelog and one for slendro, never played together.|$|R
5000|$|A {{permanent}} backstay {{is attached}} {{at the top}} of the mast and may or may not be readily adjustable. In a masthead rig, tensioning the permanent backstay will directly tension the forestay. This control is used to adjust the amount of [...] "sag" [...] in the headsail. In a fractional rig, tensioning the permanent backstay will have two effects: First, the forestay is <b>tensioned</b> (<b>controls</b> sag in headsail) and second, the mast bend is increased, particularly in the upper one-half to one-third of the mast. Increased mast bend tends to reduce the draft (camber) of the mainsail.|$|R
40|$|Haemophilus influenzae type b is a Gram-negative {{bacterium}} {{that causes}} meningitis infections in infants {{less than five}} years old [...] The capsular polysaccharide of H. influenzae type b has been purified and conjugated to a protein to produce a very effective vaccine in children. The price of this vaccine is high because there are many steps of production involved: production and purification of polysaccharide and protein (in general diphtheria or tetanus toxin), chemical conjugation of polysaccharide and protein and finally purification of the conjugated vaccine. Improvement in any of these phases of production will reduce the final price. Our laboratory studied culture conditions in order to achieve high volumetric production of this polysaccharide allowing, in near future, its introduction in the National Immunization Program with Brazilian technology. We tested three types of batch 1) overlay aeration without pH control; 2) air-sparged with dissolved oxygen <b>tension</b> <b>controlled</b> at 30 % without pH control (DOT 30 % w/o pH); 3) air-sparged aeration with dissolved oxygen <b>tension</b> <b>controlled</b> at 30 % with pH control (DOT 30 % +pH). The biomass and maximum specific growth rate are very similar in the three cases. The cultivations with DOT 30 % without pH control pH showed an average CPS-b production of 574. 3 mg/L and the DOT 30 % with pH control 943. 3 mg/L, accounting for and increase of 36 % and 124 % over the traditional polysaccharide production with overlay aeration of 420. 8 mg/L...|$|R
50|$|Tension {{adjustment}} is necessary due to several mechanical factors: oscillations caused by mechanical misalignments, differing inertial response (lag) of mechanical elements during web acceleration, out-of-round unwind and tension rolls, slipping through nip rolls, and over-aggressive web-guide correction. Several technical process and control issues also affect tension: tension setpoint changes, phase offset on driven rolls, tension bleed from one zone to another, and thermal effect (contraction/expansion) as the substrate passes through various processes. It {{is impossible to}} eliminate all factors requiring tension adjustment. Variance in any one factor in a zone necessitates changes in <b>tension</b> <b>control</b> and web speed. Consequently, with coupled tension zone control, jitter is inevitable in a continuous web where the controllers cause a feedback loop.|$|E
5000|$|In a slip-critical connection, loads are {{transferred}} from one element to another through friction forces developed between the faying {{surfaces of the}} connection. These friction forces are generated by the extreme tightness of the structural bolts holding the connection together. These bolts, usually <b>tension</b> <b>control</b> bolts or compressible washer tension indicating type bolts, are tensioned to a minimum required amount to generate large enough friction forces between the faying surfaces such that the shear (or tension) load is transferred by the structural members and not by the bolts(in shear) and the connection plates(in bearing). The [...] "turn of the nut" [...] method is also widely used to achieve that state of friction.|$|E
5000|$|Auxiliary {{devices have}} been invented {{and used for}} {{controlling}} single-line kites. Devices on board the kite's wing can react to the kite-line's tension or to the kite's angle of attack with the ambient stream in which the kite is flying. Special reel devices allow kite-line length and <b>tension</b> <b>control.</b> Moving the kite's line lower end left or right or windward or anti-windward forms part of the control system of single-line kites. Devices at the kite's bridle can be set to alter the relative lengths of sub-bridle lines in order to set {{the attitude of the}} kite so that the kite flies at a certain position of the potential positions; this can be done for one setting while the kite is readied for flight; but Kenneth C. Howard invited a device that can be operated on single-line kites during the flight session for variable settings: [...] This may be done by rapidly and repeatedly slackening the string 19. In the first described form of the invention the resulting tilting movement of the control arm 14, and the action of the pawl 22 on the teeth II, causes 15 the arm to progressively rotate around the plate 10. Thus, any desired rotated position of the arm 14 may be attained for making the kite 29 climb, dive, or fly to the right or left.|$|E

Molecular motors are a class of enzymes that exquisitely couple ATPase activity and precise changes in protein conformation. Because these mechanical changes are linked to the binding of the motor to its protein track (Figure 1, top left), the net result is directed motion.
