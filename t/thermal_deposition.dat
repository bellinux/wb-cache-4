5000|$|There are {{important}} {{differences between the}} processing of small molecule organic semiconductors and semiconducting polymers. Small molecule semiconductors are quite often insoluble and typically require deposition via vacuum sublimation. While usually thin films of soluble conjugated polymers. Devices based on conductive polymers can be prepared by solution processing methods. Both solution processing and vacuum based methods produce amorphous and polycrystalline films with variable degree of disorder. [...] "Wet" [...] coating techniques require polymers to be dissolved in a volatile solvent, filtered and deposited onto a substrate. Common examples of solvent-based coating techniques include drop casting, spin-coating, doctor-blading, inkjet printing and screen printing. Spin-coating is a widely used technique for small area thin film production. It {{may result in a}} high degree of material loss. The doctor-blade technique results in a minimal material loss and was primarily developed for large area thin film production. Vacuum based <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition</b> of small molecules requires evaporation of molecules from a hot source. The molecules are then transported through vacuum onto a substrate. The process of condensing these molecules on the substrate surface results in thin film formation. Wet coating techniques can in some cases be applied to small molecules depending on their solubility.|$|E

In this paper, a <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition</b> technique is utilized as a method to fabricate antenna structures on substrates. Thin-film deposition is achieved by evaporating a source material (metals in our case) in a vacuum which allows vapor particles to travel directly to the target substrate which is encased with a mask that outlines the desired structure. The material then condenses back to solid state. This method is used in comparison to screen printing, chemical etching, and ink jet printing to indicate advantages and disadvantages to the method. The antenna created undergoes various testing of frequency ranges, conductivity, {{and a series of}} flexing to indicate the effectiveness of the <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition</b> technique.

The success of this therapy is strongly dependent on the precision and control of <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition.</b> Hyperthermia based on induction heating, with thermally self-regulating thermoseeds inserted into the tumorous mass, is used for interstitial treatment. The technique was the subject of the numerical study presented in the paper. The analysis was carried out using coupled electromagnetic heating and thermo-fluid dynamic FEM simulations. During <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition</b> by induction heating of inserted seeds, the simulations estimated the thermal field inside and outside the tumour, as well as the sensitivity of the thermal field to variations regarding seed temperature, configuration and proximity to vessels. The method, for which accurate anatomical patient's information is essential, is suitable for providing useful qualitative and quantitative information about thermal transients and power density distribution for hyperthermic treatment. Several grid steps were analysed and compared. A 1 cm seed grid was resulted in good homogeneity and effectiveness of the <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition.</b> The cold spot effect caused by large vessels was demonstrated and quantified. Simulations of the heating of a tumorous mass in the liver showed that an indcutor generator operating at 200 kHz frequency and 500 A current, producing a pulsating magnetic field of H = 60 A cm(- 1), was adequate for the treatment.

The studies of the magnetic hysteresis for S 1, S 2, S 3 and S 4 showed that all of the samples have hysteresis loops but with dissimilar values of the saturation magnetization Ms, remanence MR, and coercivity HC. Furthermore, the hysteresis loops of all four samples showed different behaviors as the nanorods of the samples change the orientation with respect to the magnetic field. In addition to that fact, the hysteresis loop demonstrated that samples that have similar morphology have like behavior of the hysteresis loop. Also, it has found that S 2 has the largest hysteresis loop of all hematite samples and it has large hysteresis loop in the perpendicular and parallel directions with the field as well. However, the magnetite hysteresis loops are significant larger than the ones of the hematite. Likewise, the studies of the temperature dependence magnetic properties of S 2 and S 4 showed that the ZFC and FC M-T curves of S 1 and S 4 behaved differently when the direction of the nanorods changed from perpendicular to parallel with the field.
