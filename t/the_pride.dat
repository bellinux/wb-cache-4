5|$|Both {{males and}} females can defend <b>the</b> <b>pride</b> against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more {{powerful}} build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in <b>the</b> <b>pride.</b> Those lagging behind may provide other valuable services to the group. An alternative hypothesis {{is that there is}} some reward associated with being a leader who fends off intruders, and the rank of lionesses in <b>the</b> <b>pride</b> is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with <b>the</b> <b>pride</b> must defend their relationship to <b>the</b> <b>pride</b> from outside males who attempt to take over their relationship with <b>the</b> <b>pride.</b>|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{it is not}} only males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, {{although}} most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when <b>the</b> <b>pride</b> becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over <b>the</b> <b>pride,</b> adolescent lions, both male and female, may be evicted.|$|E

5|$|When first {{introduced}} {{to the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>pride,</b> the cubs initially lack confidence when confronted with adult lions other than their mother. They soon begin to immerse themselves in <b>the</b> <b>pride</b> life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own {{are more likely to be}} tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. The tolerance of the male lions toward the cubs varies – sometimes, a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away.|$|E
5|$|Years go by as Scar squanders the kingdom's {{resources}} and allows his army of hyenas to wreak havoc upon <b>the</b> <b>Pride</b> Lands, which turn barren. Meanwhile, an alive and adult Simba is visited by Mufasa's ghost, who encourages {{him to return}} to <b>the</b> <b>Pride</b> Lands and take his rightful place as king. Aided by his friends Nala, Timon and Pumbaa, Simba arrives at Pride Rock and witnesses Scar striking his mother Sarabi and confronts Scar, who demands that Simba admit to <b>the</b> <b>pride</b> that he killed Mufasa. As he prepares to throw Simba off Pride Rock and have him meet a similar fate to that of his father, Scar whispers that {{he was the one who}} killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba tackles Scar and forces his uncle to admit the truth to <b>the</b> <b>pride,</b> initiating a ferocious battle between <b>the</b> <b>pride,</b> Timon, Pumbaa, Zazu, Rafiki and Scar's hyenas. Scar tries to escape, but is cornered by Simba on the top of Pride Rock; Scar begs for mercy and even attempts to blame his crimes on the hyenas, unaware that they are listening nearby. Simba ignores Scar and gives him one last chance to run away and never return. When Simba's back is turned, Scar attacks him and they fight. Simba bests Scar in combat and throws him over the cliff edge and into a pit. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the vengeful hyenas.|$|E
