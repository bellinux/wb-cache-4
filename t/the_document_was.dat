5|$|The {{originality}} of {{this document}} remains {{a matter of}} debate. Hans K. Schulze and Hans Goetting believe that <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> presented by Otto II at their wedding feast, and then given to Theophanu. Interpreter Walter Deeters says that the separations in the text act as reading aids, showing that <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> intended to be read. Diplomats Theodor von Sickel and Carlrichard Brühl believe that the document is not the original as it lacks a seal and the lines are unusually shaped.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that Theophanu kept the {{document}} until October 989, when she left for her journey to Italy and Rome, at which time it is believed she placed it in Gandersheim Abbey to preserve the document. It was discovered and published in 1700 by writer and historian Johann Georg Leuckfeld. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz {{was among the first}} to recognise the historical significance of this document, and reports on it in History of Welf. After the secularisation of Gandersheim Abbey in 1811, <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> transferred to the Göttingen State and University Library. On 4 May 1820, the archives from the abbey were delivered to the treasury of the duchy of Brunswick. In 1835, <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> transferred to the State Archives of Wolfenbüttel, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|On the 17th, {{members of}} the twelve {{delegations}} then present in Philadelphia signed the constitution, except for the three men who had stated they would not. As <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> sent to the Articles of Confederation's Congress in New York, Mason sent {{a copy of his}} objections to Richard Henry Lee, a member of the Congress.|$|E
50|$|A {{document}} (or information object) {{has high}} retrievability {{if there are}} many queries which retrieve <b>the</b> <b>document</b> via <b>the</b> search engine, and <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>is</b> ranked sufficiently high that a user would encounter <b>the</b> <b>document.</b> Conversely, if there are few queries that retrieve <b>the</b> <b>document,</b> or when <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>is</b> retrieved <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> <b>are</b> not high enough in the ranked list, then <b>the</b> <b>document</b> has low retrievability.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Document</b> mosaicing <b>is</b> {{a process}} that {{stitches}} multiple, overlapping [...] images of a document together {{in order to produce}} one large, high resolution composite. <b>The</b> <b>document</b> <b>is</b> slid under a stationary, over-the-desk camera by hand until all parts of <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>are</b> snapshotted by <b>the</b> camera’s field of view. As <b>the</b> <b>document</b> slid under <b>the</b> camera, all motion of <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>is</b> coarsely tracked by the vision system. <b>The</b> <b>document</b> <b>is</b> periodically snapshotted such that the successive snapshots are overlap by about 50%. The system then finds the overlapped pairs and stitches them together repeatedly until all pairs are stitched together as one piece of document.|$|R
50|$|In Asia, if {{repayment}} is {{secured by}} a charge over land, <b>the</b> loan <b>document</b> <b>is</b> called a mortgage; where repayment is secured by a charge against other assets of <b>the</b> company, <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>is</b> called a debenture; and where no security <b>is</b> involved, <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>is</b> called a note or 'unsecured deposit note'.|$|R
5|$|The Marriage Charter of Empress Theophanu (State Archives of Wolfenbüttel, 6 Urk 11) is the dower {{document}} for the Byzantine princess Theophanu. Written in Latin, <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> {{created in}} the Early Middle Ages after the marriage of Theophanu to Emperor Otto II in 972, which made her the Holy Roman Empress. <b>The</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> prepared by Otto II and exemplifies an instance of political and cultural contact between the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire. It serves {{as an example of}} Ottonian Renaissance art, and the calligraphy of the manuscript has led it to be {{regarded as one of the}} most beautiful diplomatic documents of the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the negotiations, Adams {{successfully}} {{demanded that}} {{the right of the}} United States to the fisheries along the Atlantic coast be recognized. The American negotiators were able to secure a favorable treaty securing most lands east of the Mississippi, and <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> signed on September 3, 1783.|$|E
5|$|After Congress {{approved}} the final {{wording of the}} Declaration on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent {{a few blocks away}} to the printing shop of John Dunlap. Through the night, Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides for distribution. Before long, the Declaration was read to audiences and reprinted in newspapers throughout the thirteen states. The first official public reading of <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8; public readings also took place on that day in Trenton, New Jersey and Easton, Pennsylvania. A German translation of the Declaration was published in Philadelphia by July 9.|$|E

5|$|Dugdale both {{transcribed}} the Boulogne {{agreement and}} made a reference to it, in a footnote in his 1675 Baronage of England. After this <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> absent from history writing for almost three centuries. Dugdale's footnote was mentioned by certain historians, {{but it was not}} until 1965 that the document itself was again used as a source, when Noël Denholm-Young quoted a few lines from it in his History and Heraldry: 12541310. In 1972, J. R. S. Phillips printed a complete transcription of the Boulogne agreement in his book Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke 13071324.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Clarke {{spent some}} time writing war histories. Until his {{retirement}} from the army in 1947, with the rank of brigadier, he recorded the history of 'A' Force. <b>The</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> never published and remained classified till the 1970s. His first complete book was published in 1948. Seven Assignments recorded Clarke's activities during the early wartime period of 1939 and 1940 (before the Middle East posting). It was not his first attempt at a book. In 1925 Clarke had found a publisher for his coverage for the Rif rebellion, but the work was never finished.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, Alabama Territory {{was formed}} from part of Mississippi Territory. When {{the state of}} Alabama was created from part of the Tombigbee District in 1819, Toulmin was chosen to {{represent}} Baldwin County at the state's constitutional convention in July 1819. He served on the Committee of Fifteen that drafted the first Constitution of Alabama. <b>The</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> influenced by the Kentucky Constitution of 1800, which contained more democratic provisions {{than some of the}} older state constitutions.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> {{presented}} to the British Museum in 1924 by Walter Rothschild; today it is held in the British Library, which separated from the British Museum in 1973, as Additional Manuscripts number 41178. From October 1987 to May 1988 it was lent outside the UK for display in Israel's Knesset. The Israeli government are currently in negotiations to arrange a second loan in 2018, with plans to display the document at Independence Hall in Tel Aviv.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> then {{deposited}} in the temple that housed the Treasury (the aerarium). While a senatus auctoritas (vetoed Senate motion) had no legal value, it did serve to show {{the opinion of the}} Senate. If a senatus consultum conflicted with a law (lex) that was passed by a Roman Assembly, the law overrode the senatus consultum, because the senatus consultum had its authority based in precedent, and not in law. A senatus consultum, however, could serve to interpret a law.|$|E

5|$|These {{instructions}} {{stated that}} {{the objectives of the}} Partisans meant that there could be no cooperation between them and the Chetniks. They also appointed Đurišić as a Chetnik vojvoda. Some historians have challenged the authenticity of these instructions; they say <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> a forgery made by Đurišić after he failed to reach Mihailović. Other historians either do not mention any controversy about the provenance of the instructions, mention evidence supporting their authenticity, or explicitly state they consider them to be authentic.|$|E
5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, he or she is deemed to have known the contents of the document and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the contents {{and the nature of the}} contents of the document, and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay. Failure to do so without police authorization, or communicating the contents of such a document to others or publishing them is an offence.|$|E
5|$|An {{original}} typescript of {{the laws}} signed by Hitler was found by the US Army's Counter-Intelligence Corps in 1945. It {{ended up in the}} possession of General George S. Patton, who kept it, in violation of orders that such finds should {{be turned over to the}} government. During a visit to Los Angeles in 1945, he handed it over to the Huntington Library, where it was stored in a bomb-proof vault. The library revealed the existence of the document in 1999, and sent it on permanent loan to the Skirball Cultural Center, which placed it on public display. <b>The</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington in August 2010.|$|E

5|$|At 05:00 on 15 May a German {{messenger}} reached The Hague, inviting Winkelman to Rijsoord for {{a meeting}} with von Küchler to negotiate the articles of a written capitulation document. Both quickly agreed on most conditions, Winkelman declaring to have surrendered army, naval and air forces. When von Küchler demanded that pilots still fighting for the allies should be treated as francs-tireurs—seen by the Germans as guerilla fighters outside the laws of war—Winkelman's refusal made it clear to the Germans that only the armed forces in the homeland, with the exception of Zealand, would capitulate, not the country itself. On other points a swift agreement was reached and <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> signed at 10:15.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, the Great War {{had been}} ongoing {{for almost two}} years, during which anarchists had taken part in anti-war {{movements}} across Europe, issuing numerous anti-war statements in anarchist and leftist publications. In February 1915, a statement was issued by an assembly of anarchists from various regions, including England, Switzerland, Italy, the United States, Russia, France, and the Netherlands. <b>The</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> signed by such figures as Domela Nieuwenhuis, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Luigi Bertoni, Saul Yanovsky, Harry Kelly, Thomas Keell, Lilian Wolfe, Rudolf Rocker, and George Barrett. It was also endorsed by Errico Malatesta and Alexander Schapiro, two of three secretaries elected to their position at the Anarchist International of 1907. It set out several viewpoints, including that all wars {{were the result of}} the current system of society, and therefore not the blame of any particular government; did not regard a defensive and offensive war as being fundamentally distinctly different; and encouraged all anarchists to support only class conflict and the liberation of oppressed populaces as a means by which to resolve wars between nation-states.|$|E
5|$|English Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson cast strong doubts {{upon the}} {{authenticity}} of the Grolier Codex in his 1975 article The Grolier Codex, published in volume 27 of the Contributions of the University of California. Thompson argued that the codex was a modern forgery and that the unusual mix of styles in <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>was</b> not due to the mixing of cultures but rather due to the hand of a forger. Thompson queried the illustration of all four stations of Venus in the codex, noting that other Mesoamerican codices only illustrated the more spectacular appearance of Venus as morning star. This claim has been refuted more recently, with evidence presented from the Codex Telleriano-Remensis that the god of the morning star also presided over the evening star. The contents of the document have not been copied directly from any of the generally accepted Maya codices, although they do resemble pages 46 to 50 of the Dresden Codex.|$|E
