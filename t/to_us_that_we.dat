500|$|The {{following}} April, the Dean William Sancroft {{wrote to}} him that he had been right in his judgement: [...] "Our work at the west end," [...] he wrote, [...] "has fallen about our ears." [...] Two pillars had collapsed, and the rest was so unsafe that men were afraid to go near, even to pull it down. He added, [...] "You are so absolutely necessary <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can do nothing, resolve on nothing without you." ...|$|E
500|$|Now sitting upright, {{the robot}} {{looks up to}} see another robotic Björk as the {{machines}} stop the assembly. It smiles and extends its hand to the sitting robot, joining in the song. In the climax of the video, the robots passionately kiss and embrace while the machines assemble their backs and light comes and goes. The images of the kissing robots are interposed with shots of white fluid washing over robotic parts and the mechanical arms assembling them. According to the Institute for the Unstable Media, [...] "as the music fades and the pulsating beat becomes more dominant, we are once again drawn in the womb-like dark space, making it clear <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> sampled a glimpse of a black-boxed kingdom".|$|E
500|$|By 1792, Lady Charlotte Finch {{had become}} ill and deaf. Princess Sophia remarked that autumn, [...] "I am grieved to death about her, she is if {{possible}} more kind {{to us than}} ever. Indeed, both [...] and her are so good <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should not be deserving of having such treasures about us, {{if we did not}} feel their kindness in the highest degree". Finch resigned from her role in November 1792 and retired on 5 January 1793, though she continued to correspond with {{members of the royal family}} and receive gifts from them, particularly the Prince of Wales, the future George IV. She received £600 in yearly payment, supplemented by income from the South Sea Company, until her death on 11 July 1813 at St James's Palace.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding {{the purpose}} of art, O'Grady has observed: [...] "I think art’s first goal is <b>to</b> remind <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are human, {{whatever}} that is. I suppose the politics in my art could be <b>to</b> remind <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are all human." ...|$|R

500|$|In 1982, Gittings remembered, [...] "I {{joined the}} {{movement}} in 1958, when the subject of homosexuality was still shrouded in complete silence. There were no radio talk shows or TV documentaries. In all the United States, there were maybe a half dozen groups, two hundred people active in all." [...] The Daughters of Bilitis served as a social alternative to bars for lesbians, but took great care to deny that they were [...] "arranging for 'immoral contacts'." [...] While president of the DOB in New York, attending members numbered between ten and forty per meeting. They met twice a month and often invited doctors, psychiatrists, ministers and attorneys to address their meetings, even if the message was clearly disparaging to lesbians. Gittings recalled, [...] "At first we were so grateful just to have people— anybody— pay attention <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> listened to and accepted everything they said, {{no matter how bad}} it was...anything that helped to break the silence, no matter how silly or foolish it may look to us today, was important." ...|$|E
500|$|Mikengreg first {{announced}} {{the game on}} March 1, 2012, and it was later released for iPad on August 9, 2012. Mikengreg decided to release the game as free-to-play for the base game with in-app purchases for the extended content. Wohlwend saw that {{a quarter of the}} top grossing games on iOS used in-app purchases (albeit with predatory practices) and felt that they could follow the model with a more ethical strategy: free to play, but pay once to unlock forever. Wohlwend later remarked that, [...] "So far, humanity is proving <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can't have it both ways." [...] They were told by friends that the purchase function was too hidden, which they later fixed. Journalists had noted the difficulty in purchasing the full version as well. Gasketball had been downloaded 200,000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked near the top of an iTunes top downloads ranking, though it did not break the top 200 grossing chart. The game's conversion rate from its free-to-play base package to the paid version was 0.67%—lower than their goal of at least 2% of an estimated five million downloads. The paid addition includes 100 additional levels and 10 new objects.|$|E
2500|$|Part the Second {{is divided}} into four sections: [...] "To Lovers", [...] "To the Wife", [...] "To the Friend" [...] and [...] "To your Good Sort of People; being an {{appendage}} to the foregoing chapter". To wives, she tells them to [...] "Be out of humour when your husband brings company home: be angry, if he goes abroad without you; and troublesome, if he takes you with him." [...] When speaking to friends, she argues that [...] "injuries go nearest <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> neither deserve nor expect".|$|E

2500|$|.....Let it {{be known}} to you that from the time Arminius {{returned}} to us from Basel, his life and learning both have so approved themselves <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> hope the best of him in every respect, if he steadily persists in the same course, which, by the blessing of God, we doubt not he will; for, among other endowments, God has gifted him with an apt intellect both as respects the apprehension and the discrimination of things. If this henceforward be regulated by piety, which he appears assiduously to cultivate, it cannot but happen that this power of intellect, when consolidated by mature age and experience, will be productive of the richest fruits. Such is our opinion of Arminius ---a young man, unquestionably, {{so far as we}} are able to judge, most worthy of your kindness and liberality" [...] (Letter of June 3, 1585, from Beza to Amsterdam).|$|E
2500|$|In a 1980 {{fan club}} interview, Holder {{spoke of the}} album. [...] "Over {{the last couple of}} years me and Jim have been writing a lot of songs, but we haven't known which way to {{approach}} them really. With Return to Base we were really pleased with the album, we thought that it turned out really well, but it didn't sell. Everyone around the band was saying <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> weren't coming up with as good songs as we used to, but me and Jim knew that we were, we knew that we were coming up with strong songs. Some of the songs on Return to Base we thought were some of the best songs that we'd ever written. There only seemed to be me and Jim that had confidence in the songs; people like Chas, Dave and Don said that they didn't think our songs were as strong, some of them they did but some of them they didn't. But we ourselves thought that they were. Thus it was a case of getting the album down; and in our minds it turned out to be a great album." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, the University of Oregon [...] "came under – and {{resisted}} – {{pressure from}} the Chinese consul general in San Francisco" [...] to cancel a lecture by Peng Ming-Min (see above). Glenn Anthony May, a UO history professor wrote an article expressing concerns that Confucius Institutes [...] "come with visible strings attached." [...] For instance, host institutions must sign a memorandum of understanding to support the One-China policy. [...] "At universities, we normally {{have an opportunity to}} debate issues like that, allowing professors like me and students to take issue publicly with our government's policy. Hanban, for obvious reasons, wants no such discussion to occur." [...] Meiru Liu, director of the Confucius Institute at Portland State University, rejects May's criticisms CIs hinder open discussions of issues such as the treatment of political activist Liu Xiaobo. Meiru Liu explained that while Falun Gong, dissidents and 1989 Tiananmen Square protests are not topics the Confucius Institute headquarters would like to see organized by the institutes, they are [...] "not major interest and concerns now by general public at large here in the US." [...] Fellow UO professor and CI director Bryna Goodman countered May, noting the local Confucius Institute hosted forums on sensitive topics such as China's internet censorship and economic regulations, and [...] "We haven't gotten any topic that has been proposed <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have considered out of bounds." ...|$|E
