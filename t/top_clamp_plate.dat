40|$|The figure {{depicts a}} {{miniature}} cantilever-type anemometer {{that has been}} developed as a prototype of compact, relatively nonintrusive anemometers that can function at temperatures up to 600 C {{and that can be}} expected to be commercially mass-producible at low cost. The design of this anemometer, and especially the packaging aspect of the design, is intended to enable measurement of turbulence in the high-temperature, high-vibration environment of a turbine engine or in any similar environment. The main structural components of the anemometer include a single-crystal SiC cantilever and two polycrystalline SiC clamping plates, all made from chemical-vapor-deposited silicon carbide. Fabrication of these components from the same basic material eliminates thermal-expansion mismatch, which has introduced spurious thermomechanical stresses in cantilever-type anemometers of prior design. The clamping plates are heavily oxidized to improve electrical insulation at high temperature. A cavity that serves as a receptacle for the clamped end of the cantilever is etched into one end of one clamping plate. Trenches that collectively constitute a socket for a multipin electrical plug (for connection to external electronic circuitry) are etched into the opposite end of this clamping plate. Metal strips for electrical contact are deposited on one face of the other clamping plate. Piezoresistive single-crystal SiC thin-film strain gauges are etched in the n-type SiC epilayer in a Wheatstone-bridge configuration. Metal contact pads on the cantilever that extend into the clamping-receptacle area, are obtained by deposition and patterning using standard semiconductor photolithography and etching methods. The cantilever and the two clamping plates are assembled into a sandwich structure that is then clamped in a stainless-steel housing. The Wheatstone- bridge carrying SiC cantilever with the metal contact pads on the piezoresistors is slid into the receptacle in the bottom clamping plate. The top clamping plate is brought into contact with the bottom plate so that the narrow section of the metal strips on the <b>top</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>plate</b> aligns with the metal contact pads on the cantilever. When the parts are clamped together, the metal strips provide electrical connections between the Wheatstone-bridge contact points and the sides the trenches that constitute the socket for the multipin electrical plug. Hence, to connect the Wheatstone bridge to external circuitry for processing of the anemometer readout, one need only insert the plug in the socket. In operation, the cantilever end of the stainless-steel housing is mounted flush with an engine wall and the unclamped portion of the cantilever is exposed into the flow. The cantilever is deflected in direct proportion to the force induced by component of flow parallel to the engine wall and perpendicular to the broad exposed face of the cantilever. The maximum strain on the cantilever occurs at the clamped edge and is measured by the piezoresistors, which are located there. The corresponding changes in resistance manifest themselves in the output of the Wheatstone bridge...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{investigate}} universal inequalities for eigenvalues of a <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem on a bounded domain in an n-dimensional hyper-bolic space. It {{is well known}} that, for a bounded domain in the n-dimensional Euclidean space, Payne, Pólya and Weinberger (1955), Hook (1990) and Chen and Qian (1990) studied universal inequalities for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem. Recently, Cheng and Yang (2006) have derived the Yang-type universal inequality for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem on a bounded domain in the n-dimensional Euclidean space, which is sharper than the other ones. For a domain in a unit sphere, Wang and Xia (2007) have also given a universal inequality for eigenvalues. For a bounded domain in the n-dimensional hyperbolic space, although many mathematicians want to obtain a universal inequality for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem, there are no results on universal inequalities for eigenvalues. The main reason that one could not derive a universal inequality is that one cannot find appropriate trial functions. In this paper, by constructing “nice ” trial functions, we obtain a universal inequality for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem on a bounded domain in the hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we can prove that if the first eigenvalue of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem tends to (n− 1) 4 16 when the domain tends to the hyperbolic space, then all of the eigenvalues tend t...|$|R

The {{effectiveness}} of four different carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) hybridized methods to retrofit the high strength concrete columns with shear capacity deficiency {{for improving the}} shear behavior is described in this paper.

Short title: Isoperimetric and Universal Inequalities This paper reviews many of {{the known}} inequalities for the eigenvalues of the Laplacian and bi-Laplacian on bounded domains in Euclidean space.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Piezoelectric {{actuators}} and sensors {{are increasingly}} being used in applications involving vibration/position/shape control devices. Based on the self-sensing actuator (SSA) concept in which the sensors and actuators are seamlessly collocated, this paper presents {{a study on the}} robust control of a <b>clamped</b> <b>plate.</b> An analytical model of a plate with surface-bonded piezoelectric patches is derived and a -synthesis controller is designed to suppress multi-mode vibrations of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> under perturbations. The experimental results show that the symmetrical and asymmetrical modes can be effectively suppressed with designed feedback control using two piezoelectric patches which are positioned symmetrically and asymmetrically on the plate, respectively.

30|$|The {{values of}} ϖ shown in Figs.  7 and 8 clearly {{establish}} {{the superiority of}} <b>clamped</b> <b>plates</b> {{when compared to the}} simply supported ones for different aspect ratios and for any particular number of stiffeners considered here with two different orientations (i.e., along y- and both x- and y-directions). For such <b>clamped</b> <b>plates,</b> the preference of the aspect ratio is 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 for higher enhancement of fundamental frequency. It is evident from the above figures that for the same aspect ratio, the value of ϖ in case of simply supported boundary conditions is much less than that of the same number of stiffeners placed on the <b>clamped</b> <b>plates.</b> Hence, the <b>clamped</b> <b>plates</b> are preferred over the simply supported plates with/without placing any number of stiffeners with any type of orientation. Comparing the aspect ratios, it is observed that the square plates with aspect ratio 1 are more efficient than the rectangular plates having aspect ratios 1.5 and 2.0. Hence, the non-dimensional fundamental frequencies (ϖ) decrease with the increase in aspect ratios.|$|R

The effect of the nonlinear terms involving in-plane displacements in the Green-Lagrange strain expressions on the solutions is also investigated. For circular plates with relatively large thickness-to-radius ratios, the allowance for prebuckling deformation affects the critical load of <b>clamped</b> <b>plates</b> more than simply supported plates.

40|$|The linear <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> {{boundary}} value problem is a classical model in mechanics. The underlying differential equation is elliptic and of fourth order. The latter is a peculiar feature with respect to which this equation differs from numerous equations in physics and engineering which are of second order. Concerning the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> {{boundary value}} problem, “linear questions ” may be considered as well understood. This changes completely {{as soon as one}} poses the simplest “nonlinear question”: What can be said about positivity preserving? Does a plate bend upwards when being pushed upwards?
