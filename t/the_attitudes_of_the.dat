5|$|As the {{demographics}} of the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were more or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> times, tended to be villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for the homosexual was as a 'decadent slaveholding lordling' whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown by the young male heterosexual hero. During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villains.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} marred by various concerns, notably the safety of Mir {{following}} a fire and a collision, financial issues with the cash-strapped Russian Space Program and worries from astronauts about <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program administrators. Nevertheless, {{a large amount of}} science, expertise in space station construction and knowledge in working in a cooperative space venture was gained from the combined operations, allowing the construction of the ISS to proceed much more smoothly than would have otherwise been the case.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{election}} as president in 1960, Kennedy chose Cooper {{to conduct a}} then-secret mission to Moscow and New Delhi to assess <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet government for the new administration. Kennedy and Cooper had served together on the Senate Labor Committee and maintained a social friendship. On the mission, Cooper discovered that the Soviets disliked Kennedy and Nixon equally. Cooper concluded in his report to Kennedy {{that there was little}} potential for harmonious relations with the Soviets. After meeting with Secretary Khruschev, Kennedy confirmed to Cooper that his report had been correct and confessed that he should have taken it even more seriously. Cooper supported Kennedy's decision to resume nuclear weapons testing after the Soviets resumed their testing in March 1962, but he urged Kennedy to negotiate an agreement with the Soviets if possible.|$|E

25|$|The Cossiga {{presidency}} was essentially {{divided into two}} phases related to <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head of state. In the first five years, Cossiga played its role in a traditional way, caring {{for the role of}} the republican institutions under the Constitution, which makes the President of the Republic a kind of arbitrator in relations between the powers of the state.|$|E
25|$|The Barton Government {{which came}} to power {{following}} the first elections to the Commonwealth parliament in 1901 was formed by the Protectionist Party {{with the support of}} the Australian Labor Party.

The foliation never reaches <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flow plane and therefore only represents a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire deformation history.|$|R
25|$|To a {{considerable}} degree, in fact, the comedy is built upon {{a basis of}} class warfarea theme which was very familiar to British television audiences in the 1970s, a period of virtually continuous industrial strife in Britain. Whereas Bob, Thelma and Terry's sister Audrey have adapted to the various changes, Terry's five-year absence in the Army results in him being left behind, a relic of <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mid-1960s.|$|E
25|$|He {{strongly}} criticised {{the cruel}} treatment and punishment meted {{out to the}} slaves, and became more convinced {{of the need to}} improve their conditions. This led him into involvement in local government, but he was the target of much antagonism and personal attack from the planters, who resented his interference, because of his measures to ameliorate the conditions of the slaves.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catholic side {{towards the}} {{government}} and the ensuing Civil War was expressed in a joint episcopal letter from July 1, 1937, addressed by the Spanish bishops to all other Catholic bishops. Spain was said to be divided into two hostile camps, one side expresses anti-religious and anti-Spanish, the other side upholding the respect for the religious and national order. The Church was pastorally oriented and not willing to sell its freedom to politics but had to side with those who started out defending its freedom and right to exist.|$|E

25|$|In {{the study}} How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-choice Paradigm (2010) the {{researchers}} criticized the free-choice paradigm as invalid, because the rank-choice-rank method is inaccurate {{for the study}} of cognitive dissonance.

25|$|The term Orientalism {{has come}} to acquire {{negative}} connotations in some quarters and is interpreted {{to refer to the}} study of the East by Westerners shaped by <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> era of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries. When used in this sense, it often implies prejudiced, outsider-caricatured interpretations of Eastern cultures and peoples. This viewpoint was most famously articulated and propagated by Edward Said in Orientalism (1978), a critical history of this scholarly tradition. In contrast, the term has also been used by some modern scholars to refer to writers of the Imperialist era who had pro-Eastern attitudes, as opposed to those who saw nothing of value in non-Western cultures.|$|E
25|$|Stuart Hall and Tony Jefferson {{argue that}} {{compared}} to other youth subcultures, the mod scene gave young women high visibility and relative autonomy. They write that this status may have been related both to <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mod young men, who accepted {{the idea that a}} young woman {{did not have to be}} attached to a man, and to the development of new occupations for young women, which gave them an income and made them more independent. Hall and Jefferson note the increasing number of jobs in boutiques and women's clothing stores, which, while poorly paid and lacking opportunities for advancement, gave young women disposable income, status and a glamorous sense of dressing up and going downtown to work.|$|E

The State Department sent the Saigon embassy a detailed cable containing questions about Vietnamese public opinion across all strata of society.
