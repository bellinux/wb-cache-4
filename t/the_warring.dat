5|$|Qin Shi Huang, {{the first}} {{ruler of the}} Qin dynasty, {{established}} China's imperial system of government in 221 BC after unifying the Seven Warring States through conquest, bringing to an end <b>the</b> <b>Warring</b> States period. For a time, the rulers of <b>the</b> <b>warring</b> states claimed nominal allegiance to an overlord king of the Zhou dynasty (c. 1050 – 256 BC), yet the Zhou kings' political power and prestige was {{less than that of}} later Chinese emperors. The imperial system fell apart after the fall of Qin in 206 BC. However, following Han's victory over Chu, the King of Han reestablished the imperial system and is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu (r. 202–195 BC).|$|E

5|$|During a siege on {{the kingdom}} of Doma, Kefka grows {{impatient}} with fellow Imperial General Leo and poisons the drinking water in the castle of Doma, resulting in mass casualties and a swift victory for the Empire. After the alliance of Espers and revolutionaries invade and destroy Vector, Gestahl feigns sorrow for the Empire's evils, and to gain {{the trust of the}} protagonists, Gestahl has Kefka imprisoned, citing the poisoning of Doma. Kefka later goes to the village of Thamasa to kill the espers congregated there, killing Leo when he tries to intervene. Using the power of the espers, Kefka helps Gestahl raise the espers' homeworld and create the Floating Continent, where they intend to awaken three entities known as <b>the</b> <b>Warring</b> Triad. Upon being confronted by the protagonists, Gestahl freezes them except for former Imperial general Celes, whom he orders to kill her friends to show her loyalty to the Empire. She instead stabs Kefka, who becomes enraged. Kefka and the Emperor then get in an argument as to what degree they will wield the power of the triad—the Emperor taking a more conservative approach, since he only wants enough power to rule the world, while Kefka wants to unleash <b>the</b> <b>Warring</b> Triad's full potential. The Emperor tries and fails to kill Kefka, who retaliates by having <b>the</b> <b>Warring</b> Triad strike Gestahl down and unceremoniously boots him off the Floating Continent to his death. Kefka then moves the statues of <b>the</b> <b>Warring</b> Triad out of balance, unleashing enough raw magical energy to reshape the face of the planet and bringing about the second act of the game.|$|E

5|$|Cuju ({{football}}): The game {{of football}} known as cuju was first mentioned in China by two historical texts; the Zhan Guo Ce (compiled from the 3rd to 1st centuries BC) and the Records of the Grand Historian (published in 91 BC) by Sima Qian (145–86 BC). Both texts recorded that during <b>the</b> <b>Warring</b> States period (403–221 BC) {{the people of}} Linzi city, capital of the State of Qi, enjoyed playing cuju along with partaking in many other pastimes such as cockfighting. Besides being a recreational sport, playing cuju was also considered a military training exercise and means for soldiers to keep fit.|$|E
5|$|During the Genêt episode, Washington, after {{consulting}} his Cabinet, issued a Proclamation of Neutrality on April 22, 1793.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes Esmāʻil Fasih’s <b>war</b> novel, <b>The</b> Winter of 1983 (Zemestān-e 62, 1985) from a narratological standpoint {{to illuminate}} how this novel differ from other Iranian wartime novels, since it explores numerous themes and perspectives on <b>the</b> <b>war</b> not explored by <b>the</b> <b>war</b> novels of this period. Whereas many wartime novels describe the active {{role of the}} working class in participating in <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>The</b> Winter of 1983 chiefly portrays the upper class’s role, and especially their outlook on <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> In addition, Fasih’s <b>war</b> novel exposes <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>the</b> Iranian cities end up in ruins due to <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> an oft-neglected aspect of <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> This dissertation also considers how The Winter of 1983 might be differently categorized, as a novel with a moderate or neutral outlook on <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>the</b> central reason being that the novel features both positive and negative aspects of <b>the</b> <b>war...</b>|$|R
5|$|Over {{the first}} months of the Second World War Norwegian {{neutrality}} was violated repeatedly in the air and at sea by both warring parties, most dramatically with the 16 February Altmark Incident in Jøssingfjorden. This, along with other incidents, and the lack of a firm Norwegian response, led <b>the</b> <b>warring</b> parties to the impression that Norway could or would not effectively protect her neutrality. Initially the German view of Norwegian neutrality had been one of it being positive for the German war effort, allowing German merchant ships to transport cargo via Norwegian territorial waters without interference from the British.|$|E
5|$|Soon, {{they find}} the espers and Terra convinces them to accept a truce with Gestahl. However, during the negotiations, Kefka attacks the espers, killing each of those still alive and {{capturing}} the magicite that remains from their essence. Additionally, he kills General Leo, who is appalled by Kefka's dishonorable tactics and attempts to defend the espers. The Returners reunite, now aware that the peace was a ploy for Gestahl to obtain magicite and the stone statue remains of <b>the</b> <b>Warring</b> Triad within the espers' now-unsealed land. Kefka and Gestahl travel through the open gate to the esper world, find <b>the</b> <b>Warring</b> Triad, and prompt the island on which the esper world is located to detach and fly in the sky as an ominous Floating Continent. The Returners attempt {{to stop them from}} causing further damage, but despite their efforts, they are unable to prevent Kefka and Gestahl from gaining the power of the statues. Now empowered, Kefka promptly kills Gestahl and moves the statues out of their proper alignment, upsetting the balance of magical power and causing the destruction of most of the surface world. In the disaster, the Returners are separated from one another as Setzer's airship is torn apart.|$|E
5|$|Sun Tzu's Art of War has {{influenced}} many notable figures. Sima Qian recounted that China's first historical emperor, Qin's Shi Huangdi, considered the book invaluable in ending {{the time of}} <b>the</b> <b>Warring</b> States. In the 20th century, the Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong partially credited his 1949 victory over Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang to The Art of War.

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I a number of socialist parties initially supported <b>the</b> <b>war</b> when it began in August 1914. Once <b>the</b> <b>war</b> began, Austrian, British, French, German, and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their country's intervention in <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> <b>The</b> outbreak of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> had resulted in a surge of Italian nationalism and <b>the</b> <b>war</b> {{was supported by a}} variety of political factions. One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> was Gabriele d'Annunzio who promoted Italian irredentism and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> <b>The</b> Italian Liberal Party under the leadership of Paolo Boselli promoted intervention in <b>the</b> <b>war</b> on <b>the</b> side of the Allies and utilized the Società Dante Alighieri to promote Italian nationalism. Italian socialists were divided on whether to support <b>the</b> <b>war</b> or oppose it. Prior to Mussolini taking a position on <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> a number of revolutionary syndicalists had announced their support of intervention, including Alceste De Ambris, Filippo Corridoni, and Angelo Oliviero Olivetti. The Italian Socialist Party decided to oppose <b>the</b> <b>war</b> after anti-militarist protestors had been killed, resulting in a general strike called Red Week.|$|R
5|$|The Chinese used chariots for horse-based warfare {{until light}} cavalry forces became common during <b>the</b> <b>Warring</b> States era (402221 BC).

However, {{conservative}} forces in China often opposed change, and cavalry never became as dominant as in Europe. Cavalry in China also did not benefit from the additional cachet attached to being the military branch dominated by the nobility.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} region {{now known}} as China experienced a history involving mechanics, hydraulics and mathematics applied to horology, metallurgy, astronomy, agriculture, engineering, music theory, craftsmanship, naval architecture and warfare. By <b>the</b> <b>Warring</b> States period (403–221 BC), inhabitants of <b>the</b> <b>Warring</b> States had advanced metallurgic technology, including the blast furnace and cupola furnace, while the finery forge and puddling process were known by the Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220). A sophisticated economic system in imperial China gave birth to inventions such as paper money during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The invention of gunpowder during the mid 9th century led to an array of inventions such as the fire lance, land mine, naval mine, hand cannon, exploding cannonballs, multistage rocket and rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads. With the navigational aid of the 11th century compass and ability to steer at high sea with the 1st century sternpost rudder, premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as East Africa. In water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had used the escapement mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting chain drive in the 11th century. They also made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by waterwheels and carriage wheels and wine-serving automatons driven by paddle wheel boats.|$|E
