5|$|Hexadecimal is a base-16 {{numeral system}} {{used in the}} fields of {{computer}} programming and mathematics. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> an ordinary number most widely known by its hexadecimal representation; in decimal notation, it is 13,256,278,887,989,457,651,018,865,901,401,704,640.|$|E
5|$|If a cell {{containing}} <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> found, {{the search}} returns the value from that cell. Otherwise, if an empty cell is found, the key cannot {{be in the}} table, {{because it would have}} been placed in that cell in preference to any later cell that has not yet been searched. In this case, the search returns as its result that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> not present in the dictionary.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to remove a key–value pair from the dictionary. However, it {{is not sufficient to}} do so by simply emptying its cell. This would affect searches for other keys that have a hash value earlier than the emptied cell, but that are stored in a position later than the emptied cell. The emptied cell would cause those searches to incorrectly report that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> not present.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Keys</b> <b>is</b> a {{settlement}} located south of Bay Bulls, Newfoundland and Labrador. <b>The</b> <b>Keys</b> <b>is</b> now {{a part of}} the town of Bay Bulls, as are the communities of Irishtown, Bread and Cheese, and Gunridge.|$|R
50|$|A {{signature}} scheme has a signing <b>key,</b> which <b>is</b> kept private, and a verification <b>key,</b> which <b>is</b> publicly revealed. For instance, in signature schemes {{based on}} RSA <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> both exponents. In the UOV scheme, {{and in every}} other multivariate signature scheme <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> more complex.|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} evaluated rate {{dependency and}} a neuropharmacological model of timing as {{explanations of the}} effects of amphetamine on behavior under discriminative control by time. Four pigeons pecked keys during 60 -trial sessions. On each trial, the houselight was lit for a particular duration (5 to 30 s), and then <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>was</b> lit for 30 s. In Experiment 1, <b>the</b> <b>key</b> could <b>be</b> lit either green or blue. If <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>was</b> lit green and the sample was 30 s, or if <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>was</b> lit blue and the sample was 5 s, pecks produced food on a variable-interval 20 -s schedule. <b>The</b> rate of <b>key</b> pecking increased as a function of sample duration when <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>was</b> green and decreased as a function of sample duration when <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>was</b> blue. Acute d-amphetamine (0. 1 to 3. 0 mg/kg) decreased higher rates of key pecking and increased lower rates of key pecking as predicted by rate dependency, but did not shift the timing functions leftward (toward overestimation) as predicted by the neuropharmacological model. These results were replicated in Experiment 2, in which <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>was</b> lit only one color during sessions, indicating that the effects were not likely due to disruption of discriminative control by key color. These results are thus consistent with rate dependency but not with the predictions of the neuropharmacological model...|$|R
5|$|On April 25, 2008, the FIBA Central Board {{approved}} rule {{changes that}} included {{the changes in the}} shape of the key; <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> now rectangular and has virtually the same dimensions as the key used in the NBA. In addition, the no-charge semicircle formally called the restricted area arc was also created. The change took effect in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In {{a perfect}} scenario, this would enable every block {{to be written}} to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. Unfortunately, the process to evenly {{distribute}} writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can be written into those blocks. Each time data are relocated without being changed by the host system, this increases the write amplification and thus reduces {{the life of the}} flash memory. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> to find an optimum algorithm which maximizes them both.|$|E
5|$|On {{board the}} Forerunner ship, the Master Chief is {{captured}} and interrogated by Covenant forces, but manages to escape using a concealed weapon. On Earth, Ruwan and Tyla escape detection by the Covenant and appropriate a vehicle {{in an effort}} to escape. Ruwan reveals that <b>the</b> <b>Key</b> <b>is</b> in fact a fictional object that he and his brother James Ackerson made up as children; James told the Covenant about the Key in order to prevent the outright destruction of Cleveland. After fighting Covenant forces, Ruwan and Tyla are rescued by marines and leave the city. The Master Chief attempts to kill the Covenant's leader, Prophet of Truth, but is discovered as he takes aim; Truth escapes as the Chief is left to kill the Prophet's guards and find a way off the ship. Learning {{that there is no way}} to change the Forerunner ship's destination, the Chief jumps to Earth using a piece of the vessel as a heat shield.|$|E
50|$|The {{climate and}} {{environment}} of <b>the</b> Florida <b>Keys</b> <b>are</b> {{closer to that}} of the Caribbean than the rest of Florida, though unlike the Caribbean's volcanic islands, <b>the</b> <b>Keys</b> <b>were</b> built by plants and animals. <b>The</b> Upper <b>Keys</b> islands <b>are</b> composed of sandy-type accumulations of limestone grains produced by plants and marine organisms. <b>The</b> Lower <b>Keys</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> remnants of large coral reefs, which became fossilized and exposed as sea level declined.|$|R

5|$|The {{auxiliary}} {{system is}} powered via a separate transformer winding feeding three independent {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT) converters each providing a three-phase 400volt system. The locomotive is designed {{with an open}} system architecture that can be adapted later. Diagnostic information is available to the driver and can be sent to the control center via GSM-R. The locomotive has a large and bright cab with space for up to three people. The second series of locomotives have an improved driver's chair, which has been retrofitted on the older trains. The machine room has a center hallway. All high-current equipment is located behind a door which can only be opened with a special key. This key is locked {{in such a way that}} it cannot be accessed without grounding the locomotive, and similarly the locomotive cannot be ungrounded again until <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> back in place.|$|E
25|$|Sustain {{level is}} the level during the main {{sequence}} of the sound's duration, until <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> released.|$|E
25|$|Attack time is {{the time}} taken for initial run-up of level from nil to peak, {{beginning}} when <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> first pressed.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> {{not stored}} (because the hash {{function}} is collision-free), {{there may be}} no easy way to enumerate <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> that <b>are</b> present in the table at any given moment.|$|R

50|$|After {{receiving}} <b>the</b> <b>key,</b> <b>the</b> recipient <b>is</b> {{a member}} of the honor society and is entitled to wear <b>the</b> <b>key</b> with his or her academic regalia. No specified means for displaying <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>are</b> given, therefore <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> often displayed by various means (chains, pins, or attachments) on the academic robes of graduating students.|$|R
25|$|Release time is {{the time}} taken for the level to decay from the sustain level to zero after <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> released.|$|E
25|$|The running key {{variant of}} the Vigenère cipher was also {{considered}} unbreakable at one time. This version uses as the key a block of text {{as long as the}} plaintext. Since <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> as long as the message the Friedman and Kasiski tests no longer work (<b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> not repeated). In 1920, Friedman was the first to discover this variant's weaknesses. The problem with the running key Vigenère cipher is that the cryptanalyst has statistical information about the key (assuming that the block of text is in a known language) and that information will be reflected in the ciphertext.|$|E
25|$|In the (more recent) OpenPGP specification, trust {{signatures}} {{can be used}} {{to support}} creation of certificate authorities. A trust signature indicates both that the key belongs to its claimed owner and that the owner of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> trustworthy to sign other keys at one level below their own. A level 0 signature is comparable to a web of trust signature since only the validity of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> certified. A level 1 signature is similar to the trust one has in a certificate authority because a key signed to level 1 is able to issue an unlimited number of level 0 signatures. A level 2 signature is highly analogous to the trust assumption users must rely on whenever they use the default certificate authority list (like those included in web browsers); it allows the owner of the key to make other keys certificate authorities.|$|E

50|$|A balafon can {{be either}} fixed-key (where <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> strung over a fixed frame, usually with {{calabash}} resonators underneath) or free-key (where <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> placed independently on any padded surface). The balafon usually has 17-21 keys, tuned to a tetratonic, pentatonic or heptatonic scale, depending on {{the culture of the}} musician.|$|R

25|$|After a {{character}} is struck on the paper, the mechanism is reset, including replacing all latches on their bails and moving the interposer back into position. If the key that was pressed is still down at this time, the interposer rotates the keylever pawl {{out of the}} way to prevent key repeat until <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> released and depressed again, starting the next cycle.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the length}} of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> known, the {{ciphertext}} can be rewritten into that many columns, with each column corresponding to a single letter of the key. Each column consists of plaintext that has been encrypted by a single Caesar cipher; the Caesar key (shift) is just {{the letter of the}} Vigenère key that was used for that column. Using methods similar to those used to break the Caesar cipher, the letters in the ciphertext can be discovered.|$|E
25|$|An {{improvement}} to the Kasiski examination, {{known as}} Kerckhoffs' method, matches each column's letter frequencies to shifted plaintext frequencies {{to discover the}} key letter (Caesar shift) for that column. Once every letter in <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> known, the cryptanalyst can simply decrypt the ciphertext and reveal the plaintext. Kerckhoffs' method is not applicable when the Vigenère table has been scrambled, rather than using normal alphabetic sequences, although Kasiski examination and coincidence tests can still {{be used to determine}} key length in that case.|$|E

25|$|MTL amnesic {{patients}} with localized {{damage to the}} hippocampus retain other perceptual abilities, {{such as the ability}} to intelligently function in society, to make conversation, to make one's bed, etc. Additionally, anterograde amnesics without combined retrograde disorders (localized damage to the MTL system) have memories prior to the traumatic event. For this reason, the MTL is not the storage place of all memories; other regions in the brain also store memories. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> the MTL is responsible for the learning of new materials.|$|E
25|$|More formally, {{the data}} being sorted can be {{represented}} as a record or tuple of values, and {{the part of the}} data that is used for sorting is called the key. In the card example, cards are represented as a record (rank, suit), and <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> the rank. A sorting algorithm is stable if whenever there are two records R and S with the same key, and R appears before S in the original list, then R will always appear before S in the sorted list.|$|E
25|$|Secret sharing schemes are {{important}} in cloud computing environments. Thus a key can be distributed over many servers by a threshold secret sharing mechanism. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> then reconstructed when needed. Secret sharing has also been suggested for sensor networks where the links are liable to be tapped by sending the data in shares which makes {{the task of the}} eavesdropper harder. The security in such environments can be made greater by continuous changing of the way the shares are constructed.|$|E
