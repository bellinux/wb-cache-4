[...] He said that after watching [...] "the tornado <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> mother", he thought [...] "Oh my God, how is Frances Bean gonna survive this insanity?"

500|$|Critic Robert Christgau also {{considered}} [...] "Overprotected" [...] and [...] "Cinderella" [...] as {{the highlights of}} Britney, while saying, [...] "hardly the first not-terribly-bright teenager to approach self-knowledge via the words of others". Nikki Tranker of PopMatters said the song [...] "is an absolute belter reminiscent of Britney’s previous big-bang singles, 'Oops! I Did It Again' and 'You Drive Me Crazy' [...] ", while commenting that Spears [...] "sings about ridding herself of the girlie chains around her, gripes about her need for space in the whirlwind <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> life, and lets us know she don’t need nobody telling her what to do." [...] In 2003, the song received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.|$|E
500|$|Lydia {{discovered}} Zoe's true intentions for befriending her, {{and set out}} to take revenge. In {{a second}} interview with E4, Lister stated: [...] "I was really surprised when I learned about Zoe's 'master plan' to get Lydia to confess because I think after everything that Zoe's been through [...] the last thing she wants to do is ever see Lydia again, let alone try and make friends with her! But <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> only way, so I think it's really interesting." [...] She continued: [...] "The fight and the chase stuff with Lydia in the graveyard was really good, we filmed it at night. I was dressed as Madonna. We were in a cemetery, it was brilliant!..." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Tom Ewing of The Guardian, Body Talk Pt. 2 is [...] "faster, harder, [...] clubbier" [...] {{than its}} predecessor. The writer {{described}} it as [...] "the Body Talk for people who like their Robyn upbeat, fierce and dancefloor-ready." [...] According to Adam Johns of Drowned in Sound, the album marks a departure from Robyn's [...] "formula of 'creative' tracks sprinkled through with low-key pop gems." [...] He recalled her previous work as [...] "high-tech" [...] {{and said that the}} songs on Body Talk Pt. 2 are [...] "sprinkled with italo-sounding synths, arpreggios and minor-key arrangements." [...] Joe Colly of Pitchfork noted that Robyn [...] "primarily sticks with the quick-moving, clubby synth-pop <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> calling card." [...] Jaime Gill of BBC Music noted its [...] "beats-driven approach" [...] and the mix between electro, house, hip hop, classic disco and [...] "orchestral, tear-teasing balladry." ...|$|E
500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend also {{expressed}} a good {{perspective on the}} episode, considering it {{to have been the}} best episode of the season. Deeming the episode an [...] "eye-opening experience", West described Ellis' surprising personality as having worse repercussions on her daughter than the control issues and the intense disapproval that had previously been noted on the character: [...] "You would think after Ellis had a few hours to digest the news that she has essentially lost her mind, she would take advantage of the gift <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> brief lucidity to patch things up with Meredith. Meredith was hesitant to sit and talk with her mother about the last five years but finally she decides this could be her only chance." [...] Comparing Ellis' previous appearances in the series with the version presented in the episode, West stated she is [...] "far worse" [...] as a lucid person, noting how frustration and confusion are her main characteristics.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Spielberg {{approached}} {{her to play}} an insecure air hostess in his comedy The Terminal, a film about a man (Tom Hanks) who is trapped at the JFK International Airport when he is denied entry into the United States. Spielberg was intent on her playing against type as a strong-willed woman, with a vulnerability in her character, but the critic A. O. Scott felt that it came across as using her for [...] "her looks rather than for the arch, self-mocking wit <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> secret weapon as a comic actress". Commercially, The Terminal performed well. She next worked with Soderbergh to film Ocean's Twelve, a sequel to his heist film Ocean's Eleven (2001), which also reunited her with stars Clooney, Pitt, and Roberts. The production, which was filmed in several countries across Europe, saw Zeta-Jones play Isabel Lahiri, a Europol agent, and the love interest of Pitt's character. Paul Clinton of CNN noted that her sex appeal benefited the film. Conversely, Ken Tucker of New York magazine argued that her character was redundant to the film's plot. Despite dividing critics, the sequel earned over US$360 million globally.|$|E

2500|$|The {{marriage}} contract is concluded between the wali, or guardian, {{of the bride}} and bridegroom, not between bridegroom and bride [...] The wali of the bride can only be a free Muslim. The wali of the bride is normally a male relative of the bride, preferably her father. If the bride is a virgin, the wali mujbir, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> father or paternal grandfather, can not force the bride into the marriage against her proclaimed will; according to most scholars. According to Khomeini and Ali al-Sistani, both Shia scholars (both having the degrees mujtahid and marja'), and also almost all contemporary scholars, the marriage is invalid without bride's free consent and no obligation can make marriage official and legal.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2006, he {{was again}} accused of making {{insensitive}} jokes about cancer sufferers, blind people, {{a woman in}} a wheelchair, and the recent trial over the murder of Damilola Taylor, prompting a woman to walk out of the show in disgust. Davidson vehemently denied the charge, claiming that jokes about blind people and cancer sufferers would have merited a [...] "mass walkout". He also said the comments about the Damilola Taylor trial were taken out of context: [...] "My actual remark was that I thought the killers should be locked away forever. And if she objects to that then <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> prerogative. Davidson was also quoted as saying [...] "If what I was saying was true I would have got up and left myself".

2500|$|Caroline, a {{successful}} career woman, is introduced {{as the daughter of}} protagonist Celia Dawson (Anne Reid), who falls in love again in her mid-seventies. Lancashire states <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> mother's second marriage that inspires Caroline, a closeted lesbian, to [...] "finally be herself". The first series of Last Tango in Halifax deals with the break-up of Caroline's marriage to John (Tony Gardner) and the establishment of a relationship between Caroline and her colleague Kate (Nina Sosanya). Wainwright had intended Caroline's love-life to provide a source of drama and believed a gay relationship to be a more interesting story. Caroline's sexuality is a source of contention for Celia across the series, Anne Reid noted that their arguments are [...] "vicious"; whilst Lancashire noted that Caroline is [...] "wounded" [...] by her mother's [...] "non-acceptance" [...] after she decides to marry Kate. In the third series, Wainwright decided to kill off Kate, as she felt this the only way to reconcile Celia with her daughter, leaving Caroline a widow and single-mother.|$|E
2500|$|NME {{noted that}} the album sees Minogue [...] "dropping her {{considerable}} concern for cool and bouncing back to her disco-pop roots", adding that [...] "Light Years {{is all you need}} to know about Kylie in less than an hour: fun, perfectly-formed, not too taxing and occasionally annoying." [...] Yahoo! Music's Gary Crossing referred to the album as [...] "a polished, well-produced yet largely undemanding collection of disco, Hi-NRG, Ibizan trance, funk, 60s film and TV themes and Latin-flavoured tunes which like the Minogue minx's attire leaves very little to the imagination." [...] He also opined that [...] "ou just get the feeling that if those concerned put as much effort into the songwriting as they did into the glossy album sleeve photo shoot things might have been a whole lot better." [...] Andrew Lynch of entertainment.ie viewed the album as [...] "inconsequential stuff and as with all Kylie's albums the quality is disappointingly uneven. But the best tracks have an engagingly bouncy quality and taken as a whole this is a much better record than most critics would like to admit." [...] Select praised the album, stating that [...] "apart from the foul Lloyd-Webber-esque ballad 'Bittersweet Goodbye', it's an unrelenting hoot" [...] and that [...] "it's all contrived to within an inch of its life, heaving with potential singles and brazenly derivative. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> job and she does it well." ...|$|E

2500|$|When William Adam MP asked Fitzwilliam for money, {{he replied}} on 2 August {{that he would}} not pay a farthing to {{newspapers}} which propagated republicanism: [...] "I trust I was always found as ready to make my proportionable deposits for services done as any of my associates, but the party was broke up {{a year and a half}} ago" [...] and [...] "from that period...I must be understood...as free from all demands for existing or future services". When Adam suggested that Fitzwilliam could join with Fox in condemning the conduct of the war (which Britain had joined in February 1793), Fitzwilliam replied on 15 November: [...] "I never will act in party with men who call in 4,000 weavers to dictate political measures to the government—nor with men whose opposition is laid against the constitution more than against the Ministers... interference for the purpose of settling the internal government. ... France must start again from her ancient monarchy, and improving upon <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> only chance of establishing a system that will give happiness to herself, and ensure peace and security to her neighbours". The only hope for the party was [...] "a completely successful termination of the present war" [...] because it was this and not parliamentary reform which divided the party. However, when a public subscription was founded to settle Fox's debts (over £60,000), Fitzwilliam contributed a considerable amount. In declining Richard Burke's request for a seat in Parliament, Fitzwilliam wrote to him on 27 August: ...|$|E
