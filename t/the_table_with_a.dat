5|$|Gannon became {{manager of}} Stockport County, {{now in the}} National League North, {{for the third time}} in his career on 18 January 2016. Gannon started off well, taking the team to the Cheshire Senior Cup final and up to ninth in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{sequence}} of seven games unbeaten, including five victories, in the run up to Easter. County finished eighth in the 2016–17 season, one point outside the play-offs. Gannon was credited with turning around the career of Danny Lloyd, who signed for Peterborough United in May 2017, 12 months after Gannon had persuaded him to play for County rather than quit the game altogether. Gannon said that he was pleased with his defence, but wanted to overhaul the attacking side so as to reach the play-offs the following season.|$|E
5|$|In January 2002, {{chairman}} Doug Ellis {{once again}} appointed Graham Taylor as manager. Villa finished the 200102 season in eighth place, which {{was similar to}} most of their other Premiership finishes. Taylor quit as manager {{for the second time}} {{after the end of the}} 200203 season. Villa had just finished 16th in the Premiership, losing twice to arch rivals Birmingham City. David O'Leary, who had taken Leeds United to the semi-finals of the 200001 Champions League, was brought in as Taylor's replacement. O'Leary took the team to sixth in <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 20 home defeat against Manchester United on the final day meaning that they narrowly missed out on a UEFA Cup place. In 200506, Villa slowly fell down the table and finished in 16th place. The poor placing came despite O'Leary having spent more than £13million the previous summer on players such as Milan Baroš, Kevin Phillips and Wilfred Bouma.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} main match, Ric Flair faced Shawn Michaels. During the match, Michaels {{set up a}} table at ringside and {{positioned}} Flair on it. Randy Orton then came through the audience and attempted to interfere in the match, but Michaels performed Sweet Chin Music on him and put Flair through <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Splash. Near {{the end of the}} match, Michaels knocked the referee down and {{as he was about to}} perform a Sweet Chin Music on Flair, allowing Orton to hit Michaels with a chair. Orton then placed Flair on top of Michaels and ran out of the ring. When the referee recuperated, he saw the cover and officiated the pinfall made by Flair.|$|E

5|$|After Al-Rasheed was {{promoted}} to the top division, most of Iraq's national team players signed for them, which {{made it difficult for}} the other teams to compete. Even so, in the 1985–86 Iraqi National League and under the management of Yahya Alwan, Al-Talaba won their third league title against all expectations. They finished the season with 25 points, two points ahead of the favourites Al-Rasheed. On 27 December 1985, {{one of the most important}} matches of the season, which could have decided the championship, was played between Al-Talaba and Al-Rasheed in front of 50,000 spectators at the Al-Shaab Stadium. The match ended in a 1–0 win for Al-Talaba with the goal being from a penalty taken by Hussein Saeed in the 63rd minute. Saeed was the season's joint top goalscorer along with Ahmed Radhi and Rahim Hameed. Al-Talaba participated in the 1986 Asian Club Championship where they reached the final round but finished last in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single point. Al-Talaba also participated in the Saddam International Tournament in 1986, hosted in Baghdad, but finished third in their group and failed to reach the semi-finals. By winning the league, Al-Talaba qualified for the 1986 Al-Muthabara Cup but were defeated 2–1 by Al-Rasheed.|$|E
5|$|During the close-season, Johnson {{sought a}} {{possible}} new club back in England, {{and before the}} start of the 2010 season in America, he was given a trial with Major League Soccer side Seattle Sounders FC joining them for their pre-season training camp. Having trained with Sounders, Johnson decided to stay with Austin Aztex and signed a new two-year contract. In the first game of the Aztex season, Johnson hit the goalpost with a 20-yard curling shot, but Lawrence Olum scored with the rebound, helping the Aztex to a 2–0 victory against Montreal Impact. During May, Johnson scored five goals, including two in a 3–3 draw with Tampa Bay and made two assists to help Austin record an unbeaten spell. He again scored two goals in a 2–1 Aztex victory over Miami and helped take his team to the top of the table by being the club's leading goalscorer throughout the campaign. Heath also used him in his original position in attack, including as a sole striker in a defeat to Puerto Rico Islanders. It was a result that saw the Aztex lose their top spot for the first time in three months. A week later, Johnson scored his tenth goal of the season to give his side their fourth win in five games by defeating Carolina RailHawks 3–2. The Aztex returned to the top of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2–0 victory against NSC Minnesota Stars with Johnson scoring the opening goal of the game. Aztex qualified for the end-of-season play-offs where they faced Montreal Impact over two legs. Johnson scored one of Aztex's two goals in the second leg but their season finished with a 5–2 aggregate defeat. Johnson played a total of 28 games during the season, scoring 15 goals, and earned a place in the 2010 season best XI.|$|E

They won only 1 match against Wayamba Elevens but lost against Ruhuna, Kandurata and Basnahira. But this time their captain was Thilina Kandamby.|$|E

25|$|The 1996–97 season started just {{as badly}} as the last, with three {{straight}} losses. However, the introduction of young forward Andrew Fotiadis saw Luton burst into life, as they shot up <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> run of eight wins and two draws in eleven games. Tony Thorpe, too, {{proved to be a}} revelation, scoring 28 goals to become the division's top scorer. Luton were nearly promoted, but finished in third place on goal difference and then lost to Crewe Alexandra in the play-offs.|$|E

25|$|August {{began with}} a seven-wicket loss in a one-day tour match to Bangladesh A, before a 234-run Championship win over Leicestershire sent them second in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> game in hand. Three National League matches {{followed}} - with two wins and a loss - before they drew with Yorkshire {{for the second time}} in the Championship season, sending them out of the promotion zone as they trailed Yorkshire by 1.5 points. The day after the Championship draw with Yorkshire finished, they travelled to Edgbaston for the C Trophy semi-final, where they lost to Warwickshire. Two more one-day defeats followed, but their last match in August was an innings win in the Championship, which meant that they saw out August in second place.|$|E
25|$|Higgins was {{involved}} in a match of the highest quality against Mark Allen {{in the second round of}} the World Championship. At 9–8 ahead he cleared <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 63 break after Allen had had a kick when on a break of 58. Higgins went on to win 13–9 and then had routine victories over Kyren Wilson and Barry Hawkins to reach his first World Championship final in six years and, at 41 years of age, be the oldest finalist in 35 years. It was also a rematch of the 2007 final as he faced Mark Selby and Higgins started well to take a 10–4 lead. He then lost 12 of the next 14 frames, but pulled back to 16–15 down, before Selby won the two frames he required to claim the title.|$|E

25|$|Despite having signed {{four new}} players in Steve McManaman, Paul Bosvelt, David Seaman and Michael Tarnat, 2003–04 was a {{difficult}} season for City. They were in with a slight chance of relegation up to the penultimate game of the season, finishing 16th in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> goal difference of +1. Nonetheless, the season had some high points, with City defeating Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane after being down 3–0 at half-time during an FA Cup replay, with their match prospects worsened after Joey Barton was sent-off {{on the brink of}} the interval. City, however, pulled off one of the greatest FA comebacks of all time, scoring four second-half goals from Sylvain Distin, Paul Bosvelt, Shaun Wright-Phillips and a headed winner by Jon Macken to seal a famous victory. There was also a 4–1 humbling of rivals Manchester United at Eastlands.|$|E
25|$|Essex were {{expected}} to bounce back strongly after relegation from the top tier the season before. A five-wicket win at home to Yorkshire provided a good start to the league. A quickfire 99 from Ryan ten Doeschate clinched a tie away at Leicestershire soon after. The Eagles then extended their unbeaten run with a win away at Derbyshire, which included unbeaten centuries from Jason Gallian and Ravi Bopara, the former's coming off just 54 balls. Good quality bowling on an infrequently used wicket at Southend allowed Essex to bowl out Northants for just 61, before knocking off the total in just under 15 overs. Two days later The Eagles further consolidated their place {{at the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> victory over struggling Surrey in a rain-affected match at County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford. Promotion then seemed certain after Mark Pettini's 70 guided Essex to another win at Colchester against Glamorgan.|$|E
25|$|The first {{match of}} December was an ING Cup match between the Redbacks and the Bushrangers. The Bushrangers could go second in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> win, but after rain delayed the start for 90 minutes and {{shortened}} both teams' innings to 41 overs, spinners Dan Cullen and Darren Lehmann shared seven wickets and limited the Bushrangers {{to a total}} of eight for 204 in their rain-shortened innings. Michael Klinger notched up 103, the Bushrangers' first one-day century of the season, but Greg Blewett and Mark Cosgrove shared an unbeaten 143-run partnership for the third wicket to guide the Redbacks home after two wickets from Peter Siddle had seen the Redbacks to two for 62. In the women's league, the Breakers extended their run of victories to four, while one bonus point and a win in the first match against Western Fury was enough to see Victoria Spirit into the second place, despite losing the second match.|$|E

25|$|Yorkshire Phoenix {{failed to}} convert a good {{position}} against Surrey Lions, who moved off last place in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> win. Having initially been placed in the field by Surrey's captain Mark Ramprakash, they conceded 111 for the first wicket, James Benning and Jonathan Batty making 72 and 41 respectively. A burst of three wickets from Richard Dawson's off-spin sent Surrey struggling at 127 for 4, but Ramprakash paired up with Rikki Clarke to recover, and Clarke then unleashed a late cameo off Ian Harvey to end with 90 not out off 71 balls to see Surrey to a final total of 264 for 7. In reply, Yorkshire looked confident at 222 for 2, recovering from the early shock of losing Matthew Wood for a golden duck. However, a couple of run-outs and a wicket from Tim Murtagh saw Tim Bresnan face the last ball with Yorkshire needing four to win - he was bowled by Nayan Doshi, and Surrey won by three runs, despite conceding 15 wides.|$|E

Bafétimbi Gomis pounced on an Apoula Edel error to salvage a point for Lyon against Paris Saint-Germain. Nenê's ninth Ligue 1 goal allowed Paris Saint-Germain to run out home winners over Brest and stand second in the table. Nenê took his tally to 11 Ligue 1 strikes as the Brazilian struck twice to keep Paris Saint-Germain in second place with a win at Valenciennes. PSG missed out on first place in Ligue 1 as Daniel Niculae levelled for AS Monaco two minutes from time. Paris Saint-Germain suffered only a second defeat in 23 competitive matches as Nancy registered an unexpected home win. PSG kept up the pressure on Lille {{at the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> narrow win over Sochaux at the Parc des Princes. Mevlüt Erdinç netted twice as Paris Saint-Germain survived a second-half fightback from Arles-Avignon to claim a win that kept the pressure on league leaders Lille. Rennes put a miserable last week behind them by edging PSG to get their title bid back on track. Paris Saint-Germain failed to find a way past Lens in a goalless draw at the Parc des Princes. PSG closed to within four points of leaders Lille with a comprehensive win at Nice. Paris Saint-Germain remained in title contention after a hard-fought victory over Toulouse at the Parc des Princes. Kamel Chafni produced a sumptuous strike to give Auxerre the win and dent PSG's title hopes.|$|E
25|$|On 7 May, Southampton faced Liverpool at Anfield {{in a game}} {{which ended}} as a goalless draw. The game {{featured}} very few chances on goal for either side, with the Saints failing to manage a shot on target the entire 90 minutes. The best chance of the game came for the home side in the second half, when a handball by Jack Stephens resulted in a penalty; however, James Milner's spot kick was saved by Fraser Forster and the scores remained level. Marko Grujić almost scored with a header late on, but it remained goalless. Three days later the club hosted Arsenal and lost 2–0 to the Gunners. After a first half with very few chances for either side, the visitors opened the scoring after 60 minutes when Alexis Sánchez beat two defenders to score his 20th league goal of the season. 23 minutes later, after being on {{as a substitute for}} just three minutes, Olivier Giroud headed in the second, securing Arsenal's ascent to fifth in the table. On 13 May, Southampton played their final away game of the season against relegated Middlesbrough, winning 2–1 to move up to ninth in <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>With</b> <b>a</b> markedly changed lineup (including the debut of centre-back Martín Cáceres), the Saints started the game slowly, but opened the scoring through Jay Rodriguez shortly before half-time. After coming on {{at the start of the}} second half, Nathan Redmond doubled the lead for the visitors in the 57th minute. Shane Long missed a penalty less than ten minutes later, before Patrick Bamford scored a consolation for Boro later on. On 17 May, the club drew 0–0 with Manchester United and moved up to eighth in the table. The Saints were awarded a penalty within the opening five minutes for a handball by Eric Bailly; the penalty was taken by Manolo Gabbiadini but saved by Sergio Romero. Bailly forced a save out of Fraser Forster later in the half, and in the second half Anthony Martial hit the post.|$|E
