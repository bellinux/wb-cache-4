Castelli {{proposed}} a resumption of Álzaga's idea of creating a governing Junta, but not headed by the Spanish. Belgrano insisted on the plan to appoint Charlotte as regent of a constitutional monarchy, and Rodriguez Peña proposed a military coup, with or without Liniers at the head. <b>They</b> <b>finally</b> accepted the perspective of Cornelio Saavedra, and delayed taking action until a better opportunity.|$|E
5|$|After {{her husband}} died in 1841, a series of {{complications}} obstructed Hańska's marriage to Balzac. Chief of these was the estate and her daughter Anna's inheritance, both of which might be threatened if she married him. Anna married a Polish count, easing some of the pressure. About the same time, Hańska gave Balzac the idea for his 1844 novel Modeste Mignon. In 1850 <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> married, and moved to Paris, but he died five months later.

5|$|Attacks {{against the}} Han River pontoon bridges at Seoul {{do not seem}} to have been {{successful}} until FEAF ordered the Bomber Command to lay delayed action bombs alongside the bridges on August 27, set to detonate at night. This method of attack seems to have caused such heavy casualties among the North Korean labor force trying to keep the pontoons in repair that <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> abandoned the effort. These bridges remained unfinished when the UN forces recaptured Seoul later in the year.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, budget {{concerns}} and national trends {{made it clear}} that Louisville Girls High School and duPont Manual would merge into one coeducational school. <b>They</b> <b>finally</b> did so in September 1950 and remained in the old Louisville Girls High School building. This fusion of institutions resulted in the birth of the modern duPont Manual High School – dropping 'Training' from its previous name. The same school building remains in use today, although two major additions have since been made. The middle school located on the building's first floor became Manly Junior High and moved to Manual's old building at Brook and Oak.|$|E

5|$|In the whaleboat, Melville had, like De Long, ridden out {{the storm}} {{by means of a}} sea anchor. The boat's course was far to the south of De Long's; <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> reached land at one of the main mouths of the Lena, and were able to {{navigate}} upriver. Within a few days they encountered a native fishing camp, and by September 25 had reached the settlement of Arrhu.

5|$|In this episode, Michael's (Steve Carell) {{controversial}} {{imitation of}} a Chris Rock routine forces the staff to undergo a racial diversity seminar.

5|$|Later, Homer {{goes back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to think. He sees old photographs, including one of himself as a child on Christmas morning, where he thinks his father was not even there when he finally got to meet Santa Claus.

Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> reconcile.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} Junior Campers, led by Ernest Borgnine, take the correct route, but {{they end up}} in a much worse position: after finding {{themselves}} trapped in a dark, tangled swamp (while being hunted by mountain men), they are attacked by a bear that Borgnine tries but fails to fight off (due to Homer stealing his Swiss Army Knife), and <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> flee to an abandoned summer camp. At the camp, they start singing songs, but are soon attacked by an unseen figure lurking in the woods, and their fates are left unknown.|$|E
