5|$|Hamilton {{points out}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> many reports and books {{over the years}} {{explaining}} the climate change problem and just how ominous the future looks for humanity. He says Requiem for a Species is primarily about why those warnings have been ignored.|$|E
5|$|According to David Potter, Vaballathus {{inherited}} his father's exact titles. Hartmann points <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{cases where}} a Greek word was translated directly to Palmyrene and a Palmyrene equivalent {{was also used}} to mean the same thing. The dedication to Odaenathus would be the using of a Palmyrene equivalent, while the inscription of Vaballathus would be the direct translation. Despite all the arguments, it cannot be certain without doubt that Odaenathus was a corrector.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 2 {{examines}} {{productivity in}} the contemporary economy. Cowen describes spurts in productivity growth, 2.8% between 1996 and 2000 and 3.8% from 2000 to 2004, and he asks if they disprove the stagnation thesis. He concedes <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> gains in certain areas, such as information technology, but argues that in other important areas such as finance, which is 8% of GDP, there has been less value created.|$|E

In 2013 it <b>was</b> reported <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> more than 450 political assassinations {{in the province of}} KwaZulu-Natal since the end of apartheid in 1994. In July 2013 the Daily Maverick reported <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> [...] "59 political murders in the last five years".

5|$|The Venusian {{surface was}} {{a subject of}} {{speculation}} until some of its secrets were revealed by planetary science in the 20th century. Venera landers in 1975 and 1982 returned images of a surface covered in sediment and relatively angular rocks. The surface was mapped in detail by Magellan in 1990–91. The ground shows evidence of extensive volcanism, and the sulfur in the atmosphere may indicate <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> some recent eruptions.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the product {{and the manner in}} which it is {{processed}} led to concerns that it might be a risk to human health, despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> no reported cases of foodborne illnesses due to consumption of the product. Among consumers, media reporting significantly reduced its acceptance as an additive to ground beef.|$|E
5|$|Gannett Glacier, on the {{northeast}} slope of Gannett Peak, is the largest single glacier in the U.S. Rocky Mountains. It has reportedly lost over 50percent of its volume since 1920 with 25percent of that occurring between the years 1980–1999. Upper Fremont Glacier has been studied {{more than any other}} glacier in the Wind River Range. Scientist have obtained ice cores from the Upper Fremont Glacier and found <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> measurable changes in the atmosphere over the past several hundred years. The Upper Fremont Glacier and the Quelccaya Ice Cap in the Andes of South America both show nearly identical atmospheric records, which indicate a global linkage of atmospheric conditions over time.|$|E

5|$|Tornadoes {{during the}} month of March are an unusual {{occurrence}} in Minnesota when compared {{to the rest of the}} spring and summer months. Before this event there had been only six tornadoes ever recorded in the state during March, and since this event there has been only six. This outbreak also marks the first time in Minnesota history that two tornadoes were recorded on the same day in March, as well as the first time since 1921 <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> multiple tornado fatalities on the same March day. Despite the historical significance of the outbreak, this was not the earliest calendar-year tornado to touch down in Minnesota; that record is held by three tornadoes that touched on March 6, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Yusef {{becomes the}} local general {{practitioner}} for Walford and takes {{an interest in}} Denise Fox (Diane Parish). He is later pickpocketed by Janine Malloy (Charlie Brooks). Denise tells Yusef <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> rumours about him going round, Dot Branning (June Brown) is responsible so he goes and talks to Dot; she ignores him. Zainab tells Yusef that Afia will be welcome to the family but he will not. Yusef reminisces about the past leading to Zainab telling Masood they must stop the wedding. Yusef starts a relationship with Denise.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to obscure}} the truth about Stanley's affair, Michael starts {{spreading}} a variety of false rumors, among them that there is another person physically inside Kevin (Brian Baumgartner), that Kelly is anorexic, that Toby (Paul Lieberstein) is still a virgin, that Pam (Jenna Fischer) is pregnant, and that Andy (Ed Helms) is gay. When Andy hears about this, he realizes that many people have thought this {{about him in the}} past and gets increasingly insecure as he begins to question his sexual orientation. Jim and Pam, who were trying to keep Pam's pregnancy a secret, think they have been found out. The couple then notice <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> various absurd rumors about office employees being spread. When Jim brings it to everyone's attention, they trace one particular rumor back to Michael, who then tries to slip out of the office.|$|E

5|$|Olivia {{agrees to}} bring Lincoln onto the case, and shows him <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> roughly thirty {{victims in the}} last several days, who have had no obvious {{connection}} or signs of death, other than that their hearts stopped. Lincoln reveals that Danzig suffered from Crohn's disease and was taking iron supplements, which leads Walter (John Noble) to realize that all of the victims were suffering from heavy metal poisoning, and that their killer extracted substances from their blood. Recognizing that several of the victims use commuter rail, Olivia initiates a manhunt at a nearby rail station. She and her team are then informed of the suspect's location, and after a chase, in which one of the pursuing FBI agents is killed and another shot in the leg, Olivia is able to kill the suspect, who also had translucent skin and had been experimenting on himself. Lincoln kills a second man with the same condition. As the FBI cleans up the area, a woman (Michelle Krusiec), also with translucent skin, watches from afar.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{estimated}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> at least 13significant earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction {{zone in the}} last 6,000years. The most recent, the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, was recorded in the oral traditions of the First Nations people on Vancouver Island. It caused considerable tremors and a massive tsunami that traveled across the Pacific Ocean. The significant shaking associated with this earthquake demolished houses of the Cowichan Tribes on Vancouver Island and caused several landslides. Shaking due to this earthquake made it too difficult for the Cowichan people to stand, and the tremors were so lengthy that they were sickened. The tsunami created by the earthquake ultimately devastated a winter village at Pachena Bay, killing {{all the people that}} lived there. The 1700 Cascadia earthquake caused near-shore subsidence, submerging marshes and forests on the coast that were later buried under more recent debris.|$|E

25|$|Violence among fans at matches {{between the}} two clubs can become so intense <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> calls to never again allow games {{between the two}} in cup {{competitions}} and that any future league games be played behind closed doors.|$|E

She was, therefore, as we have before described, taken a little by surprise. But nevertheless, she embraced her guest and cordially congratulated her.|$|R

25|$|The over-all {{pattern that}} is {{emerging}} {{suggests that the}} Americas were colonized by {{a small number of}} individuals (effective size of about 70), which grew by a factor of 10 over 800 – 1000 years.
