The framework focuses on situations where agents have varying ability to perceive their environments. These limitations on perceptual capability are formalized using the idea of <b>tolerance</b> <b>spaces.</b> It is assumed that each agent has one or more approximate databases where approximate relations are represented using intuitions from rough set theory. It is shown how sensory and other limitations can be taken into account when constructing approximate databases for each respective agent. Complex relations inherit the approximativeness inherent in the sensors and primitive relations used in their definitions. Agents then query these databases and receive answers through the filters of their perceptual limitations as represented by <b>tolerance</b> <b>spaces</b> and approximate queries. The techniques used are all tractable...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{formally}} defines similarities as tolerance relations, {{which are}} reflexive and symmetric binary relations. An abstract set with a similarity {{is called a}} <b>tolerance</b> <b>space.</b> The training data set in a learning task is a given database of independent identically distributed random pairs (Xi, Yi), where each Xi is a record and Yi is its label: Yi ∈ { 0, 1 }. The goal of the learning is to design a classifier of which the error probability is near to the theoretical limitation, the Bayes error. The learning process consists of finding a similarity of feature vectors ψ(Xi) ’s and the learning result is a representative data clustering on the <b>tolerance</b> <b>space</b> of feature vectors. The information about a record X derived from the representative clustering is the set of representatives similar to the feature vector ψ(X). The percentage of the records of class 1 in the intersection of these representative clusters is used to estimate the conditional probability of Y = 1. This paper defines a θ-classifier, which assigns the record to class 1 if the conditional probability {{is larger than the}} threshold θ. If the clustering is a partition, the threshold θ = 1 2 minimizes error probability in the training data set. In general, an optimal θ-classifier has a different threshold. The experiments show the trade-off between the number of clusters and the error probabilities of the optimal θ-classifiers...|$|E

40|$|The problem {{considered}} {{in this paper}} is how to measure the degree of resemblance between nonarthritic and arthritic hand movements during rehabilitation exercise. The {{solution to this problem}} stems from recent work on a <b>tolerance</b> <b>space</b> view of digital images and the introduction of image resemblance measures. The motivation for this work is both to quantify and to visualize differences between hand-finger movements in an effort to provide clinicians and physicians with indications of the efficacy of the prescribed rehabilitation exercise. The more recent introduction of tolerance near sets has led to a useful approach for measuring the similarity of sets of objects and their application to the problem of classifying image sequences extracted from videos showing finger-hand movement during rehabilitation exercise. The approach to measuring the resemblance between hand movement images introduced in this paper is based on an application of the well-known Hausdorff distance measure and a tolerance nearness measure. The contribution of this paper is an approach to measuring as well as visualizing the degree of separation between images in arthritic and nonarthritic hand-finger motion videos captured during rehabilitation exercise...|$|E
40|$|Much {{more than}} fault <b>tolerance,</b> <b>space</b> {{applications}} require dependability, {{which is the}} combination of availability, reliability and safety. Dependability is a major challenge when designing space computing systems, both at software and hardware level. After 30 years of contentious research on how to achieve high dependability, not an universal solution has been found. A huge effort has been invested to improve reliability, using reliable radiation hardened components. However, failures cannot be eliminated totally. The best solution one can achieve is just to postpone failures. Even when significantly postponed, failures still may occur. Big efforts are made to improve reliability, for example by using reliable radiation hardened components. Many other efforts go into improved robustness by means of fault tolerance. In our approach we join efforts from reliability and robustness to reach very high dependability using limited resources. This is important because space mi ssions have to be sparing with resources.

40|$|Abstract. In {{traditional}} {{approaches to}} knowledge representation, notions such as tolerance measures on data, distance between objects or individuals, and similarity measures between primitive and complex data structures are rarely considered. There {{is often a}} need to use tolerance and similarity measures in processes of data and knowledge abstraction because many complex systems which have knowledge representation components such as robots or software agents receive and process data which is incomplete, noisy, approximative and uncertain. This paper presents a framework for recursively constructing arbitrarily complex knowledge structures which may be compared for similarity, distance and approximativeness. It integrates nicely with more traditional knowledge representation techniques and attempts to bridge a gap between approximate and crisp knowledge representation. It can be viewed in part as a generalization of approximate reasoning techniques used in rough set theory. The strategy {{that will be used}} is to define tolerance and distance measures on the value sets associated with attributes or primitive data domains associated with particular applications. These tolerance and distance measures will be induced through the different levels of data and knowledge abstraction in complex representational structures. Once the tolerance and similarity measures are in place, an important structuring generalization can be made where the idea of a <b>tolerance</b> <b>space</b> is introduced. Use of these ideas is exemplified using two application domains related to sensor modeling and communication between agents. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} of similarity {{is essential in}} understanding and developing frameworks for reasoning with vague and approximate concepts. There is {{a wide spectrum of}} choice as to what properties we associate with similarity and such choices determine the nature of vague and approximate concepts defined in terms of these relations. Additionally, robotic systems naturally have to deal with vague and approximate concepts due to the limitations in reasoning and sensor capabilities. Halpern [1] introduces the use of subjective and objective states in a modal logic formalizing vagueness and distinctions in transitivity when an agent reasons in the context of sensory and other limitations. He also relates these ideas to a solution to the Sorities and other paradoxes. In this paper, we generalize and apply the idea of similarity and <b>tolerance</b> <b>spaces</b> [2, 3, 4, 5], a means of constructing approximate and vague concepts from such spaces and an explicit way to distinguish between an agent’s objective and subjective states. We also show how some of the intuitions from Halpern can be used with similarity spaces to formalize the above-mentioned Sorities and other paradoxes...|$|R

40|$|Where {{decisions}} {{are based on}} imprecise numeric data and linguistic variables, the development of automated decision aids presents particular difficulties. In such applications, linguistic variables often take their values from a pre-ordered set of vaguely defined linguistic terms. The mathematical structures that arise from the assumption that sets of linguistic terms are pair-wise tolerant are considered. A homomorphism between <b>tolerance</b> <b>spaces,</b> filter bases and fuzzy numbers is shown. A proposal for modeling linguistic terms with an ordered set of fuzzy numbers is introduced. A procedure for structured knowledge acquisition based on the topology of the term sets and the cognitive theory of prototypes is shown to give rise to sparse rule bases. Similarity {{as a function of}} “distance” between fuzzy numbers treated as tolerance mappings is used as an inference mechanism in sparse rule bases to give linguistically valued outputs. Measuring the “distance” between fuzzy sets to correspond to intuitive notions of nearness is not straightforward, since the usual metric axioms are not adequate. An alternative way of measuring “distance” between fuzzy numbers is introduced, which reduces to the usual one when applied to crisp numbers...|$|R
