5|$|A nocturnal {{lifestyle}} {{has been}} suggested for the primitive ceratopsian Protoceratops. However, comparisons between the scleral rings of Protoceratops and Psittacosaurus and modern birds and reptiles indicate that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals.|$|E

5|$|Although {{never truly}} domesticated, {{a small number}} of jungle cats have been found among the cat mummies of Ancient Egypt, dating to 3700 BC. The vast {{majority}} of these are domestic cats, suggesting that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used to help control rodent populations.|$|E
5|$|Another dromaeosaurid species, Deinonychus antirrhopus, may display partial flight capacities. The {{young of}} this species bore longer arms and more robust {{pectoral}} girdles than adults, and which {{were similar to those}} seen in other flapping theropods, implying that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> capable of flight when young and then lost the ability as they grew.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a wealth}} of {{skeletal}} remains, Diplodocus {{is one of the}} best-studied dinosaurs. Many aspects of its lifestyle have been subjects of various theories over the years. Comparisons between the scleral rings of diplodocines and modern birds and reptiles suggest that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals.|$|E

5|$|Only {{birds that}} are {{considered}} to have established, self-sustaining, wild populations are included on this list. This means that birds {{that are considered}} probable escapees, although <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sighted flying free, are not included.|$|E
5|$|Triceratops were herbivorous, {{and because}} of their low head, their primary food was {{probably}} low growth, although <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to knock down taller plants with their horns, beak, and bulk. The jaws were tipped with a deep, narrow beak, {{believed to have been}} better at grasping and plucking than biting.|$|E
5|$|Adopted {{children}} are children that were given up at birth, abandoned or {{were unable to}} be cared for by their biological parents. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> put into foster care before finding their permanent residence. It is particularly hard for adopted children to get adopted from foster care: 50,000 children were adopted in 2001. The average age of these children was 7, which shows that fewer older children were adopted.|$|E

5|$|Antigonid Macedonian kings {{relied on}} various {{regional}} officials to conduct affairs of state. This included high-ranking municipal officials, {{such as the}} military strategos and the politarch, i.e. the elected governor (archon) of a large city (polis), {{as well as the}} politico-religious office of the epistates. No evidence exists about the personal backgrounds of these officials, although <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> chosen among the same group of aristocratic philoi and hetairoi who filled vacancies for army officers.|$|E
5|$|During Hygeberht's archbishopric, joint synods for {{the provinces}} of Lichfield and Canterbury were held, presided over by both archbishops. These gatherings were canonically irregular, as the usual {{procedure}} was for each province to hold its own synod. The reasons for holding joint councils are unclear; <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a manifestation of Offa's desire to supervise the entire southern church, or {{an attempt by the}} archbishops of Canterbury to retain some authority over the province of Lichfield.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of Persian {{imperial}} rule in the region (c. 550–330 BCE), the Qedarites exercised control over the desert areas bordering Egypt and Israel and the traffic related to Arabian incense trade upon which Gaza depended. Herodotus (c. 484–425 BCE) writes of {{their presence in the}} northern Sinai near the Egyptian border where <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> engaged by the Achaemenids, the Persian imperial authorities, to keep that border secure as well as their control of the city of Gaza.|$|E

5|$|Gregory also {{instructed}} Augustine {{on other}} matters. Temples {{were to be}} consecrated for Christian use, and feasts, if possible, moved to days celebrating Christian martyrs. One religious site was revealed to be a shrine of a local St Sixtus, whose worshippers were unaware of details of the martyr's life or death. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> native Christians, but Augustine did not treat them as such. When Gregory was informed, he told Augustine to stop the cult and use the shrine for the Roman St Sixtus.|$|E
5|$|Juliomys anoblepas {{is known}} only from Lagoa Santa, where the genus no longer occurs; the nearest records are about 70km (43.5mi) to the southeast. It {{is one of}} several Lagoa Santa fossil rodents that no longer occur in the area. Although the precise {{environmental}} background of the Lagoa Santa fossil assemblage remains unclear, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> deposited in a period of climatic cooling that led to higher local diversity.|$|E
5|$|Motul de San José {{was first}} settled between 600 and 300 BC, {{in the latter}} portion of the Middle Preclassic period, when it was {{probably}} a fairly small site. At this time some of its satellite sites were also settled, including La Trinidad de Nosotros and Buena Vista, both of which would have been small villages at this time, and <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> settled even earlier in the Middle Preclassic, between 800 and 600 BC.|$|E

5|$|Quaggas {{have been}} {{reported}} gathering into herds of 30–50 individuals and sometimes travelled in a linear fashion. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sympatric with Burchell's zebra between the Vaal and Orange rivers. This is disputed, {{and there is no}} evidence that they interbred. It could also have shared a small portion of its range with Hartmann's mountain zebra (Equus zebra hartmannae).|$|E
5|$|Reconstructions of ankylosaur forelimb {{musculature}} made by Coombs in 1978 {{suggest that}} the forelimbs bore {{the majority of the}} animal's weight, and were adapted for high force delivery on the front feet, possibly for food gathering. In addition, Coombs suggested that ankylosaurs may have been capable diggers, though the hoof-like structure of the manus would have limited fossorial activity. Ankylosaurs were likely to have been slow-moving and sluggish animals, though <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> capable of quick movements when necessary.|$|E
5|$|Some flower-feeding thrips {{pollinate}} {{the flowers}} they are feeding on, and some authors suspect that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{among the first}} insects to evolve a pollinating relationship with their host plants. Scirtothrips dorsalis carries pollen of commercially important chili peppers. Darwin found that thrips could not be kept out by any netting when he conducted experiments by keeping away larger pollinators.|$|E
