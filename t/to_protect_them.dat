5|$|Many {{saltwater}} fish manufacture {{large amounts of}} trimethylamine oxide <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> from the high osmotic effects of their environment; conversion of this compound to dimethylamine {{is responsible for the}} early odour in unfresh {{saltwater fish}}. In animals, free radical nitric oxide (derived from an amino acid), serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation.|$|E
5|$|The elite cavalry {{corps of}} the Persians was the Aswaran. The lance was {{probably}} their preferred weapon, having {{the power to}} skewer two men simultaneously. Their horses were covered in lamellar armor <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> from enemy archers. Persian archers had a lethal range of about 175 meters and accurate range at about 50–60 meters.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the time}} the highway was completed, the federal {{government}} began to promote suburbanization by moving several federal agencies out of the capital in order <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> against nuclear attack. As a result, suburban neighborhoods {{began to appear in}} Laurel, Severn, Bowie, and Greenbelt. In addition, the road became a prime commuting route into both Washington and Baltimore, leading to suburban growth that would eventually cause the two distinct cities to merge into one large metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{are often}} {{important}} to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the moas were important browsers, {{as are the}} kereru and kokako today. Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> from the extinct moa. Nesting seabirds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas.|$|E

5|$|The eggs hatch {{in about}} 7 days. The mother may assist the nymphs in hatching. When the nymphs hatch, they eat the egg casing and {{continue}} {{to live with the}} mother. The nymphs look similar to their parents, only smaller, and will nest under their mother and she will continue <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> until their second molt. The nymphs feed on food regurgitated by the mother, and on their own molts. If the mother dies before the nymphs are ready to leave, the nymphs may eat her.|$|E

5|$|The nest, {{built from}} plant {{material}} and unlined, is placed among dense vegetation or {{in a tree}} hole. The typical clutch is around ten whitish eggs. The breeding adults, which pair for life, take turns to incubate, and the eggs hatch in 24–29 days. The downy grey ducklings leave the nest {{within a day or}} so of hatching, but the parents continue <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> until they fledge around nine weeks later.|$|E
5|$|The {{small size}} and {{independence}} of the laser modules allowed the huge NIF building to be dispensed with. Instead, the modules were arranged in groups surrounding the target chamber in a compact arrangement.

5|$|Though only {{numbering}} about 3,000 {{soldiers and}} 2,000 porters, the Belgo-Congolese force had to manage 15,000 prisoners {{in the former}} Galla-Sidamo Governorate after the campaign. At Gazzera's request, Gilliaert guaranteed the Eritrean askari safe passage to British prisoner of war camps {{in the east and}} sent Congolese guards <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> from Ethiopian retaliation. The Belgian force quickly returned to Congo with their spoils of war. The siege was the first major victory for the Free Belgian Forces and greatly improved their morale.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, both ships were fitted with a degaussing coil <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> against magnetic mines. Leipzig had her aircraft equipment removed in 1941, along with her after torpedo tubes. In 1942, Nürnbergs aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were also removed. Throughout the war, the ships' radar suites were upgraded; in March 1941, Nürnberg was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 radar set was installed. The latter was a search radar for surface targets and low-flying aircraft at low range. The FuMO 21 set {{was replaced by the}} short-range FuMO 63 Hohentwiel 50-centimeter radar. Nürnberg was also fitted with four Metox radar warning receivers. Leipzig did not receive her FuMO 24/25 radar set until 1943; this was to be the last modification for Leipzig.|$|E
5|$|Aviation was not neglected. Plans {{called for}} an air force of 18 flying boats, 18 {{reconnaissance}} fighters, 18 torpedo bombers and 18 single-seat fighters <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them.</b> Royal Air Force airfields were established at RAF Tengah and RAF Sembawang. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Lord Trenchard, argued that 30 torpedo bombers could replace the 15-inch guns. The First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Lord Beatty, did not agree. A compromise was reached whereby the guns would be installed, but the issue was reconsidered when better torpedo planes became available. Test firings of 15-inch and 9.2-inch guns at Malta and Portsmouth in 1926 indicated that greatly improved shells were required if the guns were {{to have a chance}} of hitting a battleship.|$|E
50|$|In {{more recent}} years, GCI has been supplanted, or {{replaced}} outright, {{with the introduction}} of Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C, often called AWACS) aircraft. AEW&C tends to be superior in that, being airborne and being able to look down, it can see targets fairly far away at low level, as long as it can pick them out from the ground clutter. AEW&C aircraft are extremely expensive, however, and generally require aircraft to be dedicated <b>to</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>them.</b> A combination of both techniques is really ideal, but GCI is typically only available in the defence of one's homeland, rather than in expeditionary types of battles.|$|R
