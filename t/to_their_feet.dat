5|$|The {{second round}} {{began with the}} two fighters exchanging a flurry of strikes. Silva then {{attempted}} a takedown {{with a combination of}} a body lock and a trip, but Jackson reversed it into a takedown of his own. The action stayed in Silva's guard very briefly, until the two scrambled back <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Pipil used wooden weapons {{with stone}} blades. Their weapons {{included}} long spears, atlatls (spear-throwers), arrows, and the macana (a wooden sword with inset obsidian blades {{similar to the}} Aztec macahuitl). These weapons proved inferior to elements of Spanish warfare such as steel, the horse and firearms. The Spanish described how the natives of El Salvador wore thick cotton armour, described as three fingers thick, that extended down <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> and significantly encumbered them.|$|E
5|$|The feud between John Cena and Umaga {{continued}} on Raw the next night, where Umaga assaulted Cena after his match with The Great Khali and also interfered in Cena's match with Jonathan Coachman two weeks later. Due to the Umaga assault, Cena injured his spleen, which was portrayed as real in their storyline. At Royal Rumble, a Last Man Standing match, a match {{where the only}} way to win is to beat up your opponent so much they can not get <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> before the referee counts to ten was scheduled for the WWE Championship between Cena and Umaga. Cena won the match and retained his title, ending their rivalry.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} The Undertaker against Batista in a Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Championship. At one spot, Undertaker leg dropped Batista through an {{announce}} table. Towards the end, the two fought up the entrance ramp, where Batista speared to The Undertaker off the stage. Neither man could get <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> before the referee's count of ten; in result, the match {{ended in a}} draw. Due to WWE regulations, titles can't change hands in a Last Man Standing match by a draw, so The Undertaker remained champion.|$|E
5|$|Linden's long tenure {{with the}} Canucks (Linden holds second most games played in {{franchise}} history at 1,140), deep attachment {{to the city of}} Vancouver and history of charitable community service and involvement have {{made him one of the}} most beloved and respected players among fans {{in franchise history}}. His 2001 return to the Canucks was an emotional event for fans and players alike, with Linden admitting that he was too excited to sleep the night before his first game back. He is still often referred to affectionately as 'Captain Canuck', despite not having captained the team since 1997. On April 5, 2008, the Canucks' final game of the 2007â€“08 season, the Vancouver crowd gave Linden a standing ovation before the start of the third period. Once the game ended, the crowd again rose <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> in recognition of Linden.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} scrambled <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> {{and rushed}} forward while the sappers hurried {{to break down}} the sides of the antitank ditch with picks and shovels. They advanced on a series of posts held by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Italian 115th Infantry Regiment. Posts 49 and 47 were rapidly overrun, as was Post 46 in the second line beyond. Within half an hour Post 48 had also fallen and another company had taken Posts 45 and 44. The two remaining companies now advanced beyond these positions towards a low stone wall as artillery fire began to fall along the broken wire. The Italians fought from behind the wall until the Australians were inside it, attacking with hand grenades and bayonets. The two companies succeeded in taking 400 prisoners.|$|E

Cena won the match and retained the championship after pinning Orton. The primary match on the SmackDown! brand was a Last Man Standing match for the World Heavyweight Championship between The Undertaker and Batista, which ended in a no-contest after both men failed get <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> before the referee counted to ten. The featured match on the ECW brand was Bobby Lashley versus Team McMahon (Umaga, Vince and Shane McMahon) in a Handicap match for the ECW World Championship. Vince won the title and the match for his team after pinning Lashley.|$|E
5|$|Around 1700 the Tsikoa began uniting {{around a}} series of {{powerful}} leaders. Ramanano, the chief of Vatomandry, was elected in 1710 {{as the leader of}} the Tsikoa ("those who are steadfast") and initiated invasions of the northern ports. According to oral histories, Ramanano established an armed militia at Vohimasina which he sent on incursions to burn neighboring villages, desecrate local tombs, and enslave the women and children, contributing to his reputation as a cruel and unpopular leader. A northern Betsimisaraka zana-malata named Ratsimilaho, who was born to the daughter of a local filohany and a British pirate named Tom Tew around 1694 and had briefly traveled with his father to England and India, led a resistance to these invasions and successfully united his compatriots around this cause despite his young age. He captured Fenerive in 1712, causing the Tsikoa to flee across soggy red fields of clay that stuck <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet,</b> earning them the new name of Betanimena ("Many of Red Earth"). Ratsimilaho was elected king of all the Betsimisaraka and given a new name, Ramaromanompo ("Lord Served by Many") at his capital at Foulpointe. He gave his northern compatriots the name Betsimisaraka to reaffirm their unity in the face of their enemies. He then negotiated peace with the Betanimena by offering their king control over the port of Tamatave, but this settlement fell apart after six months, leading Ratsimilaho to recapture Tamatave and force the Betanimena king to flee south. He established alliances with the southern Betsimisaraka and the neighboring Bezanozano, extending his authority over these areas by allowing local chiefs to maintain their power while offering tribute of rice, cattle and slaves; by 1730 he was one of the most powerful kings of Madagascar. By the time of his death in 1754, his moderate and stabilizing rule had provided nearly forty years of unity among the diverse clans within the Betsimisaraka political union. He also allied the Betsimisaraka with the other most powerful kingdom of the time, the Sakalava of the west coast, through marriage with Matave, the only daughter of Iboina king Andrianbaba.|$|E

25|$|To {{all those}} engrossed in the close-quarter melee it was {{something}} of a surprise to find that when all the players climbed back <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> Campese was not {{at the bottom of the}} pile, winded and wounded.

As Ryan loomed, Campese had stolen in, stolen away the ball and simply sprinted off in glorious isolation down the left hand touchline while the England B attack continued without the ball.|$|E

Rubinstein later described becoming overwhelmed by a blind fury and angrily pointing out to the public the absence of the Polish flag. He then sat down to the piano and played Poland Is Not Yet Lost loudly and slowly, repeating the final part in a great thunderous forte. When he had finished, the public rose <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> and gave him a great ovation.|$|E

To a man, and woman, the crowd rise <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> to sing the national song...the men placing their hats and hands over their hearts. Equally there was no doubting the sincere determination of the Australian team as they took the field with their caps set in a resolute angle over their eyes.|$|E
25|$|Tackling is {{the only}} way to stop a player from running and is a major part of any team's defence. A good tackle stops the player from moving forward and {{prevents}} them from passing the ball. It can also put an opponent under pressure and force the ball loose. There are five styles of tackles commonly used by players: the side, rear, passive front, active front and smother. The aim of the active front tackle is to drive the opponent backwards, while the smother tackle prevents the opposing player passing the ball. Once the player has been brought to ground, the tackler typically tries to get <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> quickly and compete for the ball. Other players arriving at the tackle will also compete for the ball.|$|E
