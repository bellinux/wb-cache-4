5|$|By {{the late}} Stuart period, the <b>Treasury</b> was often run {{not by a}} single {{individual}} such as a Lord High Treasurer but by a committee of Lords of the <b>Treasury,</b> led by the First Lord of the <b>Treasury.</b> The last Lords High Treasurer, Lord Godolphin (1702–1710) and Lord Oxford (1711–1714), ran the government of Queen Anne.|$|E
5|$|Pierce charged <b>Treasury</b> Secretary James Guthrie with {{reforming}} the <b>Treasury,</b> which was inefficiently managed and had many unsettled accounts. Guthrie increased oversight of <b>Treasury</b> employees and tariff collectors, {{many of whom}} were withholding money from the government. Despite laws requiring funds to be held in the <b>Treasury,</b> large deposits remained in private banks under the Whig administrations. Guthrie reclaimed these funds and sought to prosecute corrupt officials, with mixed success.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Treasury</b> Building is {{the center}} of a network of {{underground}} tunnels. In addition to the tunnel connecting it to the White House, another tunnel runs from the <b>Treasury</b> Building to Riggs National Bank, while yet another connects to the <b>Treasury</b> Annex (since 2015 known as Freedman's Bank). Unlike the White House to <b>Treasury</b> Building tunnel, which was constructed as an emergency exit, the other tunnels were built to facilitate the movement of freight and access to utility lines.|$|E

5|$|The {{office of}} {{quaestor}} {{was considered the}} lowest-ranking of all major political offices. Quaestors were elected by the Tribal Assembly, and the assignment of their responsibilities was settled by lot. Magistrates often chose which quaestor accompanied them abroad, and these quaestors often functioned as personal secretaries responsible for the allocation of money, including army pay. Urban quaestors had several important responsibilities, such as {{the management of the}} public <b>treasury,</b> (the aerarium Saturni) where they monitored all items going into, and coming out of, the <b>treasury.</b> In addition, they often spoke publicly about the balances available in the <b>treasury.</b> The quaestors could only issue public money for a particular purpose if they were authorized to do so by the senate. The quaestors were assisted by scribes, who handled the actual accounting for the <b>treasury.</b> The <b>treasury</b> was a repository for documents, as well as for money. The texts of enacted statutes and decrees of the Roman Senate were deposited in the <b>treasury</b> {{under the supervision of the}} quaestors.|$|E

5|$|Administrative or Economic (Polish: gospodarcze) sejmiks oversaw {{voivodeship}} self-government. Often, {{they were}} held on the day following the deputational sejmik. Their decrees were known as laudas. Some of the specific issues that these sejmiks addressed included: dealing with taxation (distribution of national taxes) and tax collectors, managing the local (voivodeship) taxes and <b>treasury,</b> recruiting local military and (from mid-1700s) election of deputies to the <b>Treasury</b> Tribunals. These sejmiks arose in the early 16th century.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the issues}} that the Mint Bureau had to face in 1933 and 1934 was the calling-in of most gold coins. When the <b>Treasury</b> Department issued {{regulations}} allowing such coins to be surrendered at branches of the Federal Reserve Bank, O'Reilly sent out a memorandum over her signature as acting director noting that the Fed had no facilities to accept any gold other than bars with a government stamp. At the time, the Mint Bureau {{was one of the}} lowest-status branches of the Department of the <b>Treasury,</b> esteemed far less than the Secret Service and other law enforcement-related agencies that fell under the <b>Treasury</b> Secretary. Burdette points out that the gold regulations showed a lack of basic Mint knowledge both by Roosevelt's appointees and the holdover senior officials from the Hoover administration.|$|E

5|$|Grant {{replaced}} Richardson as <b>Treasury</b> Secretary with Benjamin H. Bristow, a {{man known}} for his honesty, who {{began a series of}} reforms in the department. Since the Civil War, whiskey distillers and corrupt <b>treasury</b> agents falsified figures on the amount of liquor produced, while certifying bogus returns, denying the <b>treasury</b> of revenue. Discovering that millions of gallons of whiskey escaped taxation, and having Grant's endorsement to act ("Let no guilty man escape"), Bristow in May 1875 struck at the Whiskey Ring. He ordered federal marshals to seize 32 installations and arrest 350 men; Bristow obtained 176 indictments that led to 110 convictions, and giving $3,150,000 to the <b>Treasury.</b> Bristow's investigation implicated Babcock and Missouri <b>treasury</b> agent John McDonald as part of the Whiskey Ring. When informed on separate occasions, Grant became defensive concerning Babcock, but concerning McDonald, the ringleader, Grant believed he had been betrayed. In 1876, a jury acquitted Babcock at a trial influenced by Grant's deposition in Babcock's favor. After the trial, Grant dismissed Babcock from the White House. Grant freed some Ring members after a few months in prison, including McDonald, released after serving 17 months in jail.|$|E

5|$|Support for {{bimetallism}} {{grew in the}} 1870s, {{and resulted}} in {{the passage of the}} Bland–Allison Act of February 28, 1878, over the veto of President Rutherford B. Hayes. This legislation required the <b>Treasury</b> to purchase {{millions of dollars worth of}} silver bullion each month, and coin it into silver dollars—the denomination was restored as a legal tender, except when gold was specified by law or private contract. Renewed support for silver led to the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, greatly increasing the silver purchases, and requiring the <b>Treasury</b> to pay for them in banknotes that could be redeemed for gold. Over the next three years, $132,000,000 in gold was withdrawn from the <b>Treasury,</b> and amid another depression President Grover Cleveland secured the repeal of the silver purchase act.|$|E
