50|$|In diamond turning, a {{computer-controlled}} lathe with a diamond-tipped tool {{is used to}} make precision optical {{surfaces in}} glass or other optical materials. Unlike conventional optical grinding, complex aspheric surfaces can be machined easily. Instead of the dovetailed ways used on the <b>tool</b> <b>slide</b> of a metal-turning lathe, the ways typically float on air bearings, and {{the position of the}} tool is measured by optical interferometry to achieve the necessary standard of precision for optical work. The finished work piece usually requires a small amount of subsequent polishing by conventional techniques to achieve a finished surface suitably smooth for use in a lens, but the rough grinding time is significantly reduced for complex lenses.|$|E

The height of the table can be adjusted to suit this workpiece, and the table can traverse sideways underneath the reciprocating tool, which is mounted on the ram.

40|$|Screening for {{potential}} ligands and docking {{them into the}} binding sites of proteins {{is one of the}} main tasks in computer-aided drug design. Despite the progress in computational power, it remains infeasible to model all the factors involved in molecular recognition, espe-cially when screening databases of more than 100, 000 compounds. While ligand flexibility is considered in most approaches, the model of the binding site is rather simplistic, with neither solvation nor induced comple-mentary usually taken into consideration. We present results for screening dierent databases for HIV- 1 pro-tease ligands with our <b>tool</b> <b>Slide,</b> and investigate the extent to which binding-site conformation, solvation, and template representation generate bias. The results suggest a strategy for selecting the optimal binding-site conformation, for cases in which more than one independent structure is available, and selecting a rep-resentation of that binding site that yields reproducible results and the identication of known ligands...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{an effort}} to improve the {{property}} of escort mechanism of vertical internal broaching machine, a new-style escort mechanism is designed. Work process and defect about structure of escort mechanism in existence is firstly analyzed in depth, design concept and implementation methods of the new escort mechanism are then studied. Three-dimensional structure and work process are presented, and performance comparison between the new-style structure and the old one is conducted. Application study is launched at last. The innovative escort mechanism and slide board are movably connected and lumped together. In consequence, the escort mechanism will stop and then be hung at the column, while the <b>tool</b> <b>slide</b> continues to move down until broaching stop. The new-style escort mechanism has superiority such as low cost, high robust and good safety, and so on, which make it adaptive and useful for structural optimization of broaching machine.

40|$|Modeling protein {{flexibility}} in structure-based drug design and virtual screening remains a strong challenge {{due to the}} number of degrees of freedom involved and the co-optimization of protein and ligand shape and chemistry. However, there is a growing trend towards incorporating some protein side-chain flexibility modeling in docking, which enables better ligand positioning and scoring, which in turn can enhance the success of virtual screening. Here, we present several methods used for side-chain flexibility modeling in docking and recent insights gained from analyzing conformational transitions between ligand-free and bound crystal structures. BACKGROUND Improving Docking and Screening through Side-chain Flexibility Modeling Several studies have shown that better sampling of motions during docking, including sampling ligand orientations more finely and modeling induced fit between the protein and ligand, improves the ability of protein-ligand complementarity scoring functions to detect the most accurate docking (1 - 4). For instance, when using the docking and screening <b>tool</b> <b>SLIDE</b> (Screening for Ligands with Induced-fit Docking, Efficiently) t...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to learn from nature about the {{magnitudes}} of side-chain motions that occur when proteins bind small organic molecules and to test a computational model of sampling these motions {{for its ability to}} improve the prediction of protein-ligand complexes. Following analysis of protein side-chain motions upon ligand binding in 63 complexes, we tested the ability of the docking <b>tool</b> <b>SLIDE</b> to model these motions appropriately without restricting them to rotameric transitions or deciding which side chains should be modeled as flexible. The model encoded and tested is that side-chain conformational changes involving more atoms or larger angles {{are likely to be more}} costly and less prevalent than small motions due to energy barriers between rotamers and the potential of large motions to cause new steric clashes. Accordingly, SLIDE adjusts the protein and ligand side groups as little as necessary to achieve steric complementarity. We tested the hypothesis that small motions are sufficient to achieve good dockings for 63 ligands into the apo structures of 20 different proteins and compared SLIDE side-chain rotations to those experimentally observed between apo and ligand-bound structures. None of these proteins undergo major main-chain conformational change upon ligand binding...|$|E
40|$|Summary. We present our database-{{screening}} <b>tool</b> <b>SLIDE,</b> {{which is}} capable of screening large data sets of organic compounds for potential ligands to a given binding site of a target protein. Its main feature is the modeling of induced complementarity by making adjustments in the protein side chains and ligand upon binding. Mean-field theory is used to balance the conformational changes in both molecules in order to generate a shape-complementary interface. Solvation is considered by prediction of water molecules likely to be conserved from the crystal structure of the ligand-free protein, and allowing them to mediate ligand interactions, if possible, or including a desolvation penalty when they are displaced by ligand atoms that do not replace the lost hydrogen bonds. A data set of over 175 000 organic molecules was screened for potential ligands to the progesterone receptor, dihydrofolate reductase, and a DNA-repair enzyme. In all cases the screening time {{was less than a}} day on a Pentium II processor, and known ligands as well as highly complementary new potential ligands were found.

40|$|A 5 -axis {{milling machine}} has 39 {{independent}} geometric error components when the machine tool is {{considered as a}} set of five rigid bodies. The identification of the deterministic component of the systematic error is very important. It permits one to improve the accuracy close to the repeatability of the machine tool. This paper gives a new way to identify and compensate all the systematic angular errors separately and then use them further to identify the systematic translational error. Identification based on a new mathematical method and a stable numerical solution method is proposed. The model explains from first principles why some error components have no effect in a first order model. The identification of the total angular systematic errors can be done independently from the translation errors. However, the total translation error depends on the angular errors and the translation errors of each machine <b>tool</b> <b>slide.</b> The main problems solved are to find enough linear independent equations and avoid numerical instability in the computation. It is important to separate numerical problems and linear dependence. The very complex equations are first analyzed in symbolic form to eliminate the linear dependencies. The total of linear independent components in the model is reduced from 30 to 26 for the position dependent errors and from 9 to 3 for the position independent components. Secondly, the large system of linear equations is broken down in many smaller systems. The model is tested first with simulated errors modeled as cubic polynomials. An artifact-based identification is proposed and implemented based on drilling holes in various locations and orientations. New ways to measure the volumetric error directly are proposed. Direct measurement of the total volumetric error requires considerably less measurement than measuring all 6 components of each machine slide {{especially in the case of}} a 5 -axis machin...|$|E

Characterizations of tribolayers formed on the contacting surfaces between the tribopairs of the AlCrN coated tool steels and the ultra-high strength boron steels have been studied. It was found on the tribolayers of the AlCrN coated tool steels that microcracking and oxides containing Fe and Cr to increase friction coefficient were formed at the early stage of sliding wear, followed by the generation of the smeared oxide layers containing Fe transferred from the tribopair to decrease friction coefficient.

40|$|Abstract E–education or {{electronically}} transferred {{continuous education}} in pathology is one major application of virtual microscopy. The basic conditions and properties of acoustic and visual information transfer, {{of teaching and}} learning processes, as well as of knowledge and competence, influence its implementation to a high degree. Educational programs and structures can be judged by access to the basic conditions, by description of the teaching resources, methods, and its program, as well as by identification of competences, and development of an appropriate evaluation system. Classic teaching and learning methods present a constant, usually non-reversible information flow. They are subject to personal circumstances of both teacher and student. The methods of information presentation need to be distinguished between static and dynamic, between acoustic and visual ones. Electronic tools in education include local manually assisted tools (language assistants, computer-assisted design, etc.), local passive <b>tools</b> (<b>slides,</b> movies, sounds, music), open access tools (internet), and specific tools such as Webinars. From the medical point of view information content can be divided into constant (gross and microscopic anatomy) and variable (disease related) items. Most open access available medical courses teach constant information such as anatomy or physiology. Mandatory teaching resources are image archives with user–controlled navigation and labelling, student–oriented user manuals, discussion forums, and expert consultation. A classic undergraduate electronic educational system is WebMic which presents with histology lectures. An example designed for postgraduate teaching is the digital lung pathology system. It includes a description of diagnostic and therapeutic features of 60 rare and common lung diseases, partly in multimedia presentation. Combining multimedia features with the organization structures of a virtual pathology institution will result in a virtual pathology education institution (VPEI), which can develop to a partly automated distant learning faculty in medicine. </p...|$|R
