5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Grand Duchy of Moscow {{continued}} activities aimed at unifying the old Rus' lands still under Lithuanian rule. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania had insufficient resources to counter Moscow's advances, already having {{to control the}} Rus' population within its borders {{and not being able}} <b>to</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> loyalty of Rus' feudal lords. As a result of the protracted war {{at the turn of the}} 15th and 16th centuries, Moscow acquired large tracts of territory east of the Dnieper River. Polish assistance and involvement were increasingly becoming a necessary component of the balance of power in the eastern reaches of the Lithuanian domain.|$|E

25|$|The French Grande Armée had {{suffered}} horrendous casualties {{at the battle}} of Leipzig, which left the French Corps at a fraction of its prior strength. Emperor Napoleon I was in personal command of the French forces in the battle. They numbered between 40,000 and 50,000 men, but only a fraction of them were ready for combat, with Napoleon able <b>to</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> little more than 30,000 men: the IInd, Vth and XIth Army Corps, the Ist and IInd Cavalry Reserve Corps and the Imperial Guard. Guard units aside, many of the French battalions at Hanau were only 100-man strong, and the cavalry squadrons were much smaller.|$|E
25|$|The Venetians, who did {{not have}} any {{standing}} army and relied mainly on mercenaries, could only muster 8,000 men and 42 mostly small ships, under the command of the Captain General Daniel Delfin. This force was not only insufficient to meet the Ottoman army in the field, but also inadequate to man the many fortifications that the Venetians had built or enhanced during the past decades. In addition, the local Greek population disliked Venetian rule, something Damad Ali exploited, by ensuring that his troops respected their safety and property. Thus he was able <b>to</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> the good will of the Greeks, who provided his troops with ample provisions, while the Venetians, who hoped to recruit a militia amongst the native population, were left isolated in their forts.|$|E

25|$|Liutprand was {{the last}} of the Lombard kings <b>to</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> the unity of his kingdom; after him no king was able to {{eliminate}} the opposition and to reign supreme, and indeed many dukes’ defections and the constant betrayals would lead to the ultimate defeat. The strength of his power was based not only on personal charisma, but also on the reorganization of the kingdom which he had undertaken since the early years. He strengthened the chancellery of the royal palace of Pavia and defined in an organic way the territorial competencies (legal and administrative) of sculdasci, gastalds and dukes. He was also very active in the legislative field: the twelve volumes of laws enacted by him introduced legal reforms inspired by Roman law, improve the efficiency of the courts, changed the wergild and, above all, protected the weaker sectors of society including: minors, women, debtors, and slaves.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{described}} {{the size of}} Haldane’s planned Expeditionary Force (six divisions of three brigades each and a cavalry division of four brigades) as simply a “reshuffle” of the troops available in Britain, and often declared that “there was no military problem to which the answer was six divisions”. Foch {{is supposed to have}} told Wilson that he would be happy for Britain to send just a corporal and four men, provided it was right {{from the start of the}} war, and that he promised to get them killed, so that Britain would come into the war with all her strength. Foch, recently returned from a visit to Russia, was concerned that France might not be able <b>to</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> Russian support in the event of war, and was more keen than ever to enlist British military aid. He invited Wilson and Colonel Fairholme, British military attaché in Paris, to his daughter’s wedding in October 1910. On a visit to London (6 December 1910) Wilson took him for a meeting with Sir Arthur Nicolson, Permanent-Under Secretary at the Foreign Office.|$|E
25|$|Apparently {{dizzy and}} disoriented, Tunney grabbed {{on to the}} ring's top rope with his left hand. Dempsey, who used to stand over opponents and rush right back at them after they got up, looked down on Tunney. Referee Dave Barry ordered Dempsey into a neutral corner to no avail; Dempsey just stood there, observing his opponent. This gave Tunney {{precious}} seconds to recuperate. By the time Dempsey finally walked to a neutral corner, Tunney had been down for around 3 to 8 seconds. Barry could not start <b>to</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> Tunney until Dempsey reached the neutral corner, {{but he was still}} able to count to nine before Tunney got up. Some believe that if Dempsey had responded to the referee's orders in time, he would have likely regained the world Heavyweight crown with a seventh round knockout of Tunney. The validity of this argument has been debated even to this day. In the fight film, a clock was superimposed that recorded Tunney's time on the floor as 13 seconds, from the moment he fell until he got up. Because of this delay, it became known as The Long Count Fight.|$|E

500|$|Martin's {{publishers}} initially expected A Game of Thrones to be a best-seller, but {{the first}} installment did not even reach any lower positions in bestseller list. This left Martin unsurprised, as it is [...] "a fool's game to think anything {{is going to be}} successful or <b>to</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> it". However, the book slowly won the passionate advocacy of independent booksellers and the book's popularity grew by word of mouth. The series' popularity skyrocketed in subsequent volumes, with the second and third volume making The New York Times Best Seller lists in 1999 and 2000, respectively. The series gained Martin's old writings new attention, and Martin's American publisher Bantam Spectra was to reprint his out-of-print solo novels.|$|E
500|$|The euro fell {{against the}} US dollar {{for the two}} trading days {{preceding}} the vote on speculation that a win for the True Finns would hinder the prospects for the Portuguese bailout. Questions were raised whether {{the fall of the}} US dollar to a one-year low could be stemmed. The questions were partially answered on the last trading day before the election, when the dollar rose on concern for a shake-up for European confidence {{as a result of the}} election which caused bearish traders to cover their open positions. The strong showing by the True Finns and the Social Democrats caused EU leaders to worry that they may not be able <b>to</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> Finland's future support for any such bailout measure. Concerns for the euro grew in the run-up to the election and caused worry after the result. Eurozone stock markets were also upset and could be further upset as the bailout talks, expected to be concluded in mid-May, were affected. While there was no expectation that the bailout wound be derailed, [...] "caution" [...] was said to be the [...] "watchword." [...] The London Stock Exchange also considered the result a possible obstruction to the bailout.|$|E

Élia Habib, an expert on French charts, said: [...] "For [...] "Fuck Them All", to succeed in persisting on the podium, it will have <b>to</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> a broader basis of support than that of her traditional fans, [...] sufficiently numerous to send the single of their idol in the top 10 in its first week of release, but not to retain it inside the following weeks, as the last superstar's singles had regularly proved it, except [...] "Les Mots" [...] and [...] "C'est une belle journée", which were general public hits". In the following four weeks, the single dropped in the chart, then jumped from number 21 to number three on 3April 2005, selling 14,701 units that week, through the releases of the CD maxi and vinyl. Then, the song started to fall again off the chart, remaining in the top 50 for 11 weeks and on the top 100 for 19 weeks.

500|$|The Verbruggens were {{essential}} to the play, not least because Vanbrugh had customised the sprightly temptress Berinthia to Susanna's talents and reputation for witty, roguish, sexually enterprising characters, most recently Mrs Buxom in Thomas D'Urfey's Don Quixote (a success thanks to [...] "the extraordinary well acting of Mrs Verbruggen", wrote D'Urfey). Although John was less well known, his acting skills were considerable and would flourish after January 1697 in the cooperative company, where commentators even started to compare him with the great Betterton. Verbruggen was considered a more natural, intuitive or [...] "careless" [...] actor, with [...] "a negligent agreeable wildness in his action and his mien, which became him well." [...] Anthony Aston vividly described Verbruggen as [...] "a little in-kneed, which gave him a shambling gait, which was a carelessness, and became him." [...] Modern critics do not find the Loveless part very lively or irresistible, but Vanbrugh was able <b>to</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> Verbruggen's shambling male magnetism and [...] "agreeable wildness" [...] to enrich the character. This would originally have worked even in print, since cast lists {{were included in the}} published plays: most 1690s play readers were playgoers also, and aware of the high-profile Verbruggens. Happily married in private life and playing the secret lovers Loveless and Berinthia, the Verbruggens have left traces of their charisma and erotic stage presences in Vanbrugh's dialogue. The Relapse even alludes to their real-life relationship, in meta-jokes such as Berinthia's exclamation, [...] "Well, he is a charming man! I don't wonder his wife's so fond of him!" ...|$|E
500|$|The Berlin Vossische Zeitung, wrote: [...] "We have <b>to</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> reverses {{like that}} near Arras. Such events are {{a kind of}} {{tactical}} reverse. If this tactical reverse is not followed by strategical effects i.e., breaking through {{on the part of the}} aggressor, then the whole battle is nothing but a weakening of the attacked party in men and materiel." [...] The same day, the Frankfurter Zeitung commented: [...] "If the British succeed in breaking through it will render conditions worse for them as it will result in freedom of operations which is Germany's own special art of war". General Ludendorff was less sanguine. The news of the battle reached him during his 52nd birthday celebrations at his headquarters in Kreuznach. He wrote: [...] "I had looked forward to the expected offensive with confidence and was now deeply depressed". He telephoned each of his commanders and [...] "gained the impression that the principles laid down by OHL were sound but the whole art of leadership lies in applying them correctly". (A later court of inquiry would establish that Falkenhausen had indeed misunderstood the principles of defence in depth.) Ludendorff immediately ordered reinforcements. Then, on 11 April, he sacked Falkenhausen's chief of staff and replaced him with [...] Loßberg. Loßberg went armed with vollmacht (a power of command [...] enabling him to issue orders in the army ccommander's name), replacing Falkenhausen. Within hours of arriving, Loßberg began to restructure the German defences. The British aimed to consolidate the gains made in the first days of the offensive, to keep the initiative and to break through in concert with the French at Aisne. From 16 April, it was apparent that the French part of the Nivelle Offensive on the Aisne had not achieved a breakthrough. Haig continued to attack at Arras, to continue to divert troops from the French on the Aisne.|$|E

Until then Militant was always able <b>to</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> the support of most of the broad coalition on the left of the party, though privately many left-wingers were very critical of Militant's tactics and politics.".

2500|$|Also, players cannot select {{members of}} their own team.

Rather than a popularity contest or the staleness of players selecting only their own, LCBL voters must put some thought into the ballot. Receiving a peer vote is the ultimate sign of respect; a non-teammate selection recognizes a rival's talent enough <b>to</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> him to win the game.
