5|$|Later in {{the morning}} North Korean barges crossed the Naktong below A Company. The company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the {{southern}} <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge overlooking Agok to take these troops under fire. When the squad reached the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base. The company hit these houses with artillery. The North Koreans broke from the houses, running for the river. At this the light machine gun at the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge took them under fire, as did another across the Naktong to {{the south in the}} US 25th Infantry Division sector. Proximity fuze artillery fire decimated this group. Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force. In the afternoon, US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company; only part of it was recovered. The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> biggest cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{sound in}} the {{conventional}} wind turbine is the air drag at <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blades but now <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blades are covered and <b>the</b> more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind is more focused towards <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blades due to the diffuser shroud which means the air drag at <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blades are minimized.|$|R

40|$|When {{only the}} six {{anterior}} teeth remain, {{it may appear}} that indirect retention cannot be achieved because the fulcrum line around which the denture may move when the distal extensions lift away from the mucosa is located behind <b>the</b> retentive <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clasps on the abutment teeth. This {{will be the case}} when the indirect retainer and <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clasps are on the same level; however, if <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clasps are nearer to the gingival margin than the indirect retainer, indirect retentive effects will be achieved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{measurement}} used during construction was the tala, defined as {{the length of a}} human face from the forehead's hairline to the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chin or the distance from the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thumb to the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance. The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur's design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the tala have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, {{as is the case with}} the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw {{to make up the difference}} in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snout. However, the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E
5|$|At Bremerton, on {{the east}} side of the Olympics, the {{measured}} rotations are less, and within the statistical error bounds of being zero; while further north, near Port Townsend, the rotation is slightly counter-clockwise. On Vancouver Island the paleorotations are counter-clockwise, and other evidence shows that the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island has been bent, presumably as a result of the collision of Siletzia. The northwestern <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Olympic Peninsula also shows counter-clockwise rotation, of around 45 degrees. This raises a question of how much of the arcuate shape of the Crescent Formation is due to loss of material from the center after uplift by the Olympic Mountains, and how much reflects oroclinal bending.|$|E
