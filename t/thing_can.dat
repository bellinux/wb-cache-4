25|$|Additionally, {{things can}} be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, {{although}} {{not in the same}} way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect.) Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same <b>thing</b> <b>can</b> be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event. Our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino, because it cannot fall of its own accord.|$|E
25|$|In the {{conclusion}} to the essay, he wrote of the Jews that 'only one <b>thing</b> <b>can</b> redeem you from the burden of your curse: the redemption of Ahasuerus — going under!' Although this has been taken by some commentators to mean actual physical annihilation, {{in the context of}} the essay it seems to refer only to the eradication of Jewish separateness and traditions. Wagner advises Jews to follow the example of Ludwig Börne by abandoning Judaism. In this way Jews will take part in 'this regenerative work of deliverance through self-annulment; then are we one and un-dissevered!' Wagner was therefore calling for the assimilation of Jews into mainstream German culture and society - although there can be little doubt, from the words he uses in the essay, that this call was prompted at least as much by anti-semitism as by a desire for social amelioration. (In the very first publication, the word here translated as 'self-annulment' was represented by the phrase 'self-annihilating, bloody struggle').|$|E

25|$|Partly {{because it}} {{may not always be}} the case that a {{wrongdoing}} trustee can be found, or remains solvent, tracing became an important step in restitutionary claims for breach of trust. Tracing means tracking the value of an asset that properly belongs to a trust fund, such as a car, shares, money, or profits made by a trustee through a conflict of interest. If those things are exchanged for other things (i.e. money or assets) then the value residing in the new <b>thing</b> <b>can</b> potentially be claimed by the beneficiaries. For example, in an early case, Taylor v Plumer a dishonest broker, Mr Walsh, was given £22,200 in a banker's draft and was meant to invest in Exchequer Bills (UK government bonds) for Sir Plumer. Instead he bought gold doubloons and was planning a get-away to the Caribbean until he was apprehended at Falmouth. Lord Ellenborough held that the property belonged to Sir Plumer, in whatever form it had become. It may also be that the value of the traced trust money has changed, and possibly risen considerably. In the leading case, Foskett v McKeown an investment manager wrongfully took £20,440 from his clients, paid the last two out of five installments on a life insurance policy, and committed suicide. The insurance company paid out £1,000,000, although under the policy's terms this would have been paid out anyway. The majority of the House of Lords held that clients could trace their money into the payout and claim a proportionate share (£400,000). Theoretically the case was controversial, as the House of Lords rejected that such a tracing claim was founded upon unjust enrichment, as opposed to being the vindication of a property right.|$|E

500|$|Allen's {{show with}} Presley had, {{for the first}} time, beaten CBS's Ed Sullivan Show in the ratings. Sullivan, despite his June pronouncement, booked the singer for three {{appearances}} for an unprecedented $50,000. The first, on September 9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewers—a record 82.6 percent of the television audience. Actor Charles Laughton hosted the show, filling in while Sullivan recuperated from a car accident. Presley appeared in two segments that night from CBS Television City in Los Angeles, during which he was shot from only the waist up. Watching clips of the Allen and Berle shows with his producer, Sullivan said that Presley [...] "got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants–so when he moves his legs back and forth {{you can see the}} outline of his cock.... I think it's a Coke bottle.... We just can't have this on a Sunday night. This is a family show!" [...] Sullivan publicly told TV Guide, [...] "As for his gyrations, the whole <b>thing</b> <b>can</b> be controlled with camera shots." [...] In fact, Presley was shown head-to-toe in the first and second shows. Though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted in customary style: screaming. Presley's performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad [...] "Love Me Tender", prompted a record-shattering million advance orders. More than any other single event, it was this first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show that made Presley a national celebrity.|$|E
500|$|Further {{discussing}} the film's visuals, Derrickson described influences as [...] "the Steve Ditko, Stan Lee comics [...] {{were all about}} these weird visuals", as well as [...] "a fair amount of surrealist art and photography and M.C. Escher". Additional inspiration for the film's visuals came from [...] "a bunch of experimental, fractal videos from YouTube" [...] that Derrickson found, and the mobile video game Monument Valley. Derrickson's [...] "ambition was to use cutting-edge visual effects {{to do things that}} are fresh and new—to not just blow things up." [...] Feige explained that one of the more difficult areas to be inventive was the action sequences, as Derrickson did not want them [...] "to simply be: someone shoots a bolt of lightning, and someone blocks a ball of lightning, so someone throws another bolt of lightning..." [...] Instead, they tried to incorporate the use of different dimensions into the action [...] "in the interest of creating a visual tapestry that is totally different in terms of an action scene we’ve seen in any other movies." [...] On the film's set pieces, Derrickson reiterated that the film's astral fight scene was based on The Oath comic, while adding that the end fight was [...] "an attempt to capture the quality of that artwork" [...] from the original comics, and the mirror dimension chase was an attempt to take Inception [...] "to the Nth degree and take it way more surreal and way farther. But I certainly owe something to that movie." [...] Specifically for the climax of the film, Derrickson wanted to play on the superhero trope of [...] "a big fight scene where they're tearing up a city, and there's a portal opening up and they have to close it", subverting it by having the villain defeated with an intelligent use of power rather than showing [...] "which CGI <b>thing</b> <b>can</b> hit the other CGI thing harder".|$|E

[...] In spite of being reduced to fifteen for two early on, England {{made a good}} start in its pursuit of a victory target of 85. The score rose to 51 for two, with Grace and Ulyett hitting out strongly. Spofforth changed ends, and Neville Cardus wrote thus of this move: [...] "Now I was behind his arm; I could see his superb break-back. And he bowled mainly medium pace at this time. With each off-break I could see his right hand, {{at the end of}} the swing over, finish near the left side, 'cutting' under the ball. Sometimes his arm went straight over and continued straight down in the follow-through – and then the batsmen had to tackle fierce topspin. There was the sense of the inimical in his aspect now. He seemed taller than he was half an hour ago, the right arm more sinuous. There was no excitement in him he was ... cold-blooded." ...|$|E

There is a risk that those that are chiefly concerned to find out who murdered the odious blackmailer will hardly regard the solution as one of the author's happiest. There is a like risk {{that the rest of the}} audience will be bored with a comedy which has to accommodate itself to the requirements of a long police interrogation. The common ground on which both sections may stand is dangerously small." [...] The reviewer admitted that, [...] "the thriller gives all the characters a turn and yet contrives at the end to produce a twist. It is a twist which surprises rather than satisfies the logical mind." [...] but they concluded, [...] "the play as a whole is the least exciting and not the most amusing of the three Agatha Christie's now running in London." ...|$|E
