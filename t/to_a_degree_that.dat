5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown that the human eyeball is far too rigid to spontaneously change shape <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> <b>that</b> would be {{necessary}} to accomplish what Bates described. Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the eyeball (18.6–19.2 micrometres) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation. However, these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 dioptres.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire, roads in the region deteriorated. Only the Via Sclavonica is known to have existed in the region by year 1030. It was an eastwest route {{spanning}} from Pazin to Poreč. Road transport in the region lost significance after the peninsula was divided between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Republic of Venice. From 18091813, the TriestePula route was rebuilt by the First French Empire, after the French captured the entire region from Venice and the Habsburgs. Upgrades to the regional road network continued after the Austrian Empire acquired Istria at the 18141815 Congress of Vienna. By 1830, the road network in Istria had expanded <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> <b>that</b> would not change for a century and a half. The only significant improvement of region's roads was paving of the TriestePula road in 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Hoàng Cao Khải, the French-installed viceroy of Tonkin, {{perceived}} Phan's intent <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> <b>that</b> his French masters did not. Khai {{was from}} a scholar-gentry family from the same village as Phan. He became the main backer of a determined effort to crush Phan's forces, using every means available: political, psychological and economic. By late 1894, relatives and suspected sympathisers of the insurgents were intimidated and more resistance commanders had been killed. Communications were disrupted, and the rebel hideouts became increasingly insecure. In an attempt to force Phan to surrender, the French arrested his family and desecrated the tombs of his ancestors, publicly displaying the remains in Hà Tĩnh.|$|E

5|$|The way the {{painting}} shows {{the progress of}} time is also without precedent in Western art. The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome {{is seen in the}} corpse of a man, splayed {{on the ground in the}} lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> <b>that</b> renders resurrection impossible. The victim is portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer looks down on the mutilated body.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona had {{virtually}} secured their La Liga title by {{the start of}} 2013, eventually equalling Real Madrid's 100-point record of the previous season. However, their performances deteriorated {{in the second half of}} the 2012–13 campaign, concurrently with Vilanova's absence due to ill health. After losing successive Clásicos, including the Copa del Rey semi-finals, they were nearly eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League by Milan, but a revival of form in the second leg led to a 4–0 comeback, with two goals and an assist from Messi. Now in his ninth senior season with Barcelona, Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018, while his fixed wage rose to €13million. He wore the captain's armband for the first time a month later, on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; by then, he had become the team's tactical focal point <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> <b>that</b> was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier, László Kubala and Johan Cruyff. Since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier, his input into the team's attack had increased exponentially; from 24% in their treble-winning campaign, his goal contribution rose to more than 40% that season.|$|E

25|$|The {{radiation}} {{absorbed dose}} {{is the amount}} energy absorbed per unit weight of the target material. Dose is used because, when the same substance is given the same dose, similar changes are observed in the target material. The SI unit for dose is grays (Gy or J/kg). Dosimeters are used to measure dose, and are small components that, when exposed to ionizing radiation, change measurable physical attributes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> <b>that</b> can be correlated to the dose received. Measuring dose (dosimetry) involves exposing one or more dosimeters along with the target material.|$|E

Further studies to establish wild–farmed fish interactions are on-going, particularly in Canada, Scotland, Ireland, and Norway. A reference manual with protocol and guidelines for studying wild/cultured fish interactions with sea lice has been published.|$|E

Countless more fell victim to the reprehensible and perverse behavior of the combatants. In May 2002 President Kabbah and his party, the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), won landslide victories in the presidential and legislative elections. Kabbah was re-elected for a five-year term.

25|$|In the past, {{grounded}} appliances {{have been}} designed with internal isolation <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> <b>that</b> allowed the simple disconnection of ground by cheater plugs without apparent problem (a dangerous practice, since {{the safety of the}} resulting floating equipment relies on the insulation in its power transformer). Modern appliances however often include power entry modules which are designed with deliberate capacitive coupling between the AC power lines and chassis, to suppress electromagnetic interference. This results in a significant leakage current from the power lines to ground. If the ground is disconnected by a cheater plug or by accident, the resulting leakage current can cause mild shocks, even without any fault in the equipment. Even small leakage currents are a significant concern in medical settings, as the accidental disconnection of ground can introduce these currents into sensitive parts of the human body. As a result, medical power supplies are designed to have low capacitance.|$|E
