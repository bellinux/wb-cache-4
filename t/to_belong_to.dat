In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka deemed Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus to represent separate genera because Nemegtosaurus was at this time {{considered to be a}} member of the Dicraeosauridae, while Opisthocoelicaudia seemed to be a representative of a different group, the Camarasauridae.|$|E

5|$|A third North American genus called Stegomus {{was named}} by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1896. Marsh had a long-time rivalry with Cope {{that was made}} famous in the Bone Wars of the late 19th century, {{in which the two}} tried to out-compete one another in the field and in {{scientific}} literature. Unlike Cope's aetosaurs, Stegomus was found from the eastern United States in Connecticut. Marsh also recognized Stegomus as an aetosaur rather than a phytosaur in his initial description of the genus. Like Cope, many paleontologists tended to consider aetosaur scutes <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> phytosaurs during this time period.|$|E
5|$|Alignment {{with the}} Indonesian government, however, did not {{guarantee}} safety for the Torajans. In 1965, a presidential decree required every Indonesian citizen <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> {{one of five}} officially recognised religions: Islam, Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), Hinduism, or Buddhism. The Torajan religious belief (aluk) was not legally recognised, and the Torajans raised their voices against the law. To make aluk accord with the law, {{it had to be}} accepted as part of one of the official religions. In 1969, Aluk To Dolo ("the way of ancestors") was legalised as a sect of Agama Hindu Dharma, the official name of Hinduism in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitic {{legislation}} passed in 1933 {{led to the}} removal all of Jewish teachers, professors and officials from the education system. Most teachers were required <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> the Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (National Socialist Teachers League; NSLB) and university professors were required to join the National Socialist German Lecturers. Teachers had {{to take an oath}} of loyalty and obedience to Hitler and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers and dismissed. Lack of funding for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession and the average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.|$|E

5|$|Based on this star's {{kinematic}} properties, {{it appears}} <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> a stellar association called the Castor Moving Group.

All {{members of the group}} are moving in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound.

At the trial Xu Ming testified that he gave Bo's wife Gu Kailai $3.23 million in 2000 to buy the villa Fontaine St-Georges in Nice, France, and that he paid for their son Bo Guagua's travel and credit card bills. Bo Xilai cross-examined Xu and denied knowledge {{of many of the}} payments.|$|E
