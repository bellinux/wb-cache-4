5|$|Trujillo and Sheppard {{in a paper}} {{announcing the}} {{discovery}} of several more distant objects noted a correlation between the longitude of perihelion and the argument of perihelion of <b>these</b> <b>objects.</b> Those with a longitude of perihelion of 0–120° have arguments of perihelion between 280–360°, and those with longitude of perihelion of 180–340° have argument of perihelion 0–40°. The statistical significance of this correlation was 99.99%. They suggest that the correlation {{is due to the}} orbits of <b>these</b> <b>objects</b> avoiding close approaches to Planet Nine by passing above or below its orbit.

5|$|Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due {{to their}} faintness, {{there have been a}} number of successes in {{determining}} their composition. In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. acquired spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, with large amounts of methane ice. For the smaller objects, only colors and in some cases the albedos have been determined. <b>These</b> <b>objects</b> largely fall into two classes: gray with low albedos, or very red with higher albedos. The difference in colors and albedos is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of <b>these</b> <b>objects,</b> with the surfaces of those that formed far enough from the Sun to retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.|$|E

40|$|Perception {{of object}} motion {{requires}} that the visual system integrates shape and motion information about objects. However, recent fMRI studies have implicated separate human brain regions {{in the analysis of}} motion (MT/MST) and shape (lateral occipital complex-LOC). We tested whether MT/MST is involved in the analysis of both object shape and motion using fMRI. We observed higher responses to intact than scrambled images of objects in the LOC and MT/MST, especially in a ventral subregion of MT/MST, suggesting that regions involved mainly in the processing of visual motion are also engaged in the analysis of <b>object</b> shape. <b>These</b> <b>object</b> selective responses in MT/MST were observed for moving objects and static 3 D objects defined by disparity or shading but not for 2 D silhouettes of <b>objects.</b> In contrast, <b>these</b> <b>object</b> selective responses were observed in the LOC for all of <b>these</b> <b>object</b> types. Further studies tested responses to shapes defined by different cues (i. e. disparity, motion or shading) by using event-related fMRI adaptation. Lower responses for the same shape defined by different cues than two different consecutively-presented stimuli implicate neural representations of shapes independent of the cues that define their contours. Our findings suggest differential processing of visual shape in the LOC and MT/MST...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} the use of genetic programming for object detection problems. In this approach, domain independent, local region pixel statistics are used to form three terminal sets. The function set is constructed by the four standard arithmetic operators and a conditional operator. A multi-objective tness function is constructed based on detection rate, false alarm rate, false alram position and program size. This approach is applied to three object detection problems of increasing diculty. The results suggest that the concentric circular pixel statistics are more eective than the square features for the <b>these</b> <b>object</b> detection problems. The tness function with program size is more eective and more ecient for <b>these</b> <b>object</b> detection problems and the evolved genetic programs using this tness function are much shorter and easier to interpret...|$|R
5|$|A {{previous}} {{analysis by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos of commensurabilities among the known ETNOs using Monte Carlo techniques revealed a pattern {{similar to that}} of the Kuiper belt, where accidental commensurabilities occur due to objects in resonances with Neptune.

5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to the how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. <b>These</b> <b>objects</b> are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{planetary}} formation epoch the inner Solar System was populated by 50–100 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos.

5|$|Hydroxyl megamasers {{occur in}} the nuclear regions of LIRGs, and {{appear to be a}} marker in the stage of the {{formation}} of galaxies. As hydroxyl emission is not subject to extinction by interstellar dust in its host LIRG, hydroxyl masers may be useful probes of the conditions where star formation in LIRGs takes place. At redshifts of z ~ 2, there are LIRG-like galaxies more luminous than the ones in the nearby universe. The observed relationship between the hydroxyl luminosity and far infrared luminosity suggests that hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies may be tens to hundreds of times more luminous than observed hydroxyl megamasers. Detection of hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies would allow precise determination of the redshift, and aid understanding of star formation in <b>these</b> <b>objects.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Chatwin {{moved to}} London {{to begin work}} as a porter in the Works of Art {{department}} at Sotheby's.

The iconography and contents of the inscriptions show that a close relationship between Daoism and Buddhism existed in the Northern Wei state. This relationship is especially evident in some four-sided stelae that had carvings of both Laozi on two sides and the Buddha on the other two.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel way of {{performing}} pose estimation of known objects in 2 D images. We follow a probabilistic approach for modeling objects and representing the observations. <b>These</b> <b>object</b> mod-els are suited to {{various types of}} observable visual features, and are demonstrated here with edge segments. Even imperfect models, learned from single stereo views of objects, {{can be used to}} infer the maximum-likelihood pose of the object in a novel scene, using a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm, given a single, calibrated 2 D view of the scene. The probabilistic approach does not require explicit model-to-scene corre-spondences, allowing the system to handle objects without individually-identifiable features. We demonstrate the suitability of <b>these</b> <b>object</b> mod-els to pose estimation in 2 D images through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, as we show that the pose of textureless objects can be re-covered in scenes with clutter and occlusion. ...|$|R
