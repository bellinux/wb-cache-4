It's one thing to have everything you know taken away from you and have to deal with this s—y world you now have to live in. But to have barely even really recognized what the world is and how it works and what to expect and then to be thrust into this apocalyptic threat and to grow up and mature with these kinds of situations. It's going to make him grow up weird, is what I like to say." ...|$|E

Besides of this advantage there is one major problem that needs to face while keeping sensitive data in cloud, Assurance of data integrity that is data remain {{as it is on}} server for long time. Client cannot physically access the data from the cloud server directly, without client’s knowledge, Cloud Service Provider (CSP) can alter or delete data which are either unused by client from a long a time or takes large memory space. Hence, there is need of checking the data periodically for its integrity, checking data for correction is called data integrity. To overcome data integrity problem, many techniques are proposed under different systems and security models. This paper will focus on some of the integrity proving techniques in detail along with their limitations...|$|R

When we <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would mean for a just state of affairs to obtain between persons, we eliminate certain features (such as hair or eye color, height, race, etc.) and fixate upon others.

According to David Stein, the man who coined [...] "Safe, Sane, and Consensual S/M" [...] for New York’s Gay Male S/M Activists (GMSMA) SSC was only intended to be put forward as a minimum standard for ethically defensible S/M play, to establish a distinction between play between loving S/M partners and the public perception of sadomasochism which would be more accurately described as abusive behavior. Over time, as the phrase started spreading through the larger community and appeared on bumper stickers and T-shirts, people started to associate [...] "safe" [...] with [...] "risk-free," [...] diluting the message. [...] "Instead of asking people to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to do S/M ethically, {{and to make the}} hard choices that are sometimes necessary (if only between what’s right and what’s right now), many organizations today act as if these issues have all been settled, assuring us that sadistic or masochistic behavior not deemed SSC isn’t S/M at all but something else — abuse, usually, or domestic violence or poor self-esteem." ...|$|E
