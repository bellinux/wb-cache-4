5|$|In 1957, Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was {{published}} by Random House. The tale's rhyming verse accompanies illustrations by the author, and follows a disagreeable character called the Grinch and his attempts to thwart the arrival of Christmas by stealing the gifts, trims, and other <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> the holiday from the happy Whos of Whoville. In spite of his attempts, Christmas arrives all the same.|$|E
5|$|Washington's second inauguration {{took place}} in the Senate Chamber of Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the first at this site) on March 4, 1793. The presidential oath of office was {{administered}} by Supreme Court associate justice William Cushing. Washington's inaugural address was just 135 words, the shortest to date. This inauguration was brief and simple, a sharp contrast to the extravaganza four years earlier, which, in the eyes of many, had all the <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> a monarchical coronation.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the {{territory}} gained its first representative in the Parliament, although at first with limited speaking and voting rights. In 1974 it gained a fully elected, but still advisory House of Assembly. In 1988 it gained the <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> self-government with a Legislative Assembly {{with most of}} the powers and responsibilities of an Australian state, although subject to a federal right of veto, similar to the arrangements adopted for the Northern Territory in 1978. The Legislative Assembly legalised some things that were prohibited in other parts of Australia, such as prostitution and X-rated pornography; in 2006, an attempt to allow civil unions for same-sex couples was overruled by the federal government.|$|E
5000|$|Welles later {{expressed}} {{frustration with}} the film's low budget <b>trappings.</b> Most <b>of</b> the costumes were rented from Western Costume, except those for Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. [...] "Mine should have been sent back, because I looked like the Statue of Liberty in it," [...] Welles told filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich. [...] "But there was no dough for another and nothing in stock at Western would fit me, so I was stuck with it." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{architectural}} {{design of the}} château draws the gaze up towards the dreamily poetic volutes. The towers conceal their protective nature beneath festive <b>trappings,</b> redolent <b>of</b> fabulous adventures in the forests of Arthurian legends and suggestive {{of the presence of}} God in His creation. As François Cali put it: [...] "These extravagant towers are a dream landscape with constellations of canopies, pinnacles, gables and arrows, with their crockets fluttering against the light." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{left her}} and she heard him rummaging around in the pile <b>of</b> <b>trappings</b> she had noted {{in a corner of}} the other cabin. Presently he {{returned}} carrying a bundle. This he unrolled on the bed and spread out the articles.|$|R
5|$|Nicholson was {{at first}} seen as an {{improvement}} over the Catholic Thomas Dongan, the outgoing governor. However, the province's old guard was unhappy that Andros removed all of the provincial records to Boston, and then Nicholson alarmed the sometimes hardline Protestant population by preserving the <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> the chapel in Fort James that Dongan and the handful of New York's Catholics had used for worship. In response to a rumored Dutch invasion of England (a rumor {{that turned out to}} be true), Nicholson in January 1689 ordered the provincial militias to be on alert to protect the province for the king. Unknown to Nicholson, events in England had already changed things.|$|E
5|$|Set in 1964 (three {{decades before}} {{the events of}} the {{original}} Metal Gear), the story centers on FOX operative codenamed Naked Snake as he attempts to rescue a Russian rocket scientist by the name of Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov, sabotage an experimental superweapon, and assassinate his defected former boss. While previous games were set in a primarily urban environment, Snake Eater adopts a 1960s Soviet jungle setting, with the high tech, near-future <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> previous Metal Gear Solid games being replaced with the wilderness. While the setting has changed, the game's focus remains on stealth and infiltration, while retaining the series' self-referential, fourth wall-breaking sense of humor. The story of Snake Eater is told through numerous cut scenes and radio conversations.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Battleship Division Nine's {{time with}} the Grand Fleet, combating boredom was a {{constant}} difficulty. Located at the northeastern tip of Scotland, the islands surrounding Scapa Flow {{were little more than}} barren, cold, windswept specks of land devoid of the <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> civilization. Due to the efforts of the officers to keep their men entertained, however, morale remained high throughout the war. The British worked hard to turn the anchorage into a more inviting place. Central to these efforts were sporting events. The Fleet held numerous inter-ship competitions, including soccer, rugby, rowing, track, and boxing, which were followed with intense interest by the men of the respective ships.|$|E
25|$|Tintin in the New World (1993) {{is perhaps}} Tuten's best known and most {{critically}} acclaimed work. The novel's unlikely protagonist is Tintin, the cartoon boy detective created by Belgian comic artist Georges Remi, {{better known as}} Hergé. Tuten transplants Tintin from his comic book confines into a fleshed out, realistic world with all its wicked, grave and abstruse <b>trappings.</b> Appreciation <b>of</b> the book is enhanced by an acquaintance with Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain, the characters of which it uses.|$|R
60|$|Directly {{opposite}} my cage was {{the throne}} of Issus. Here the horrid creature squatted, surrounded by a hundred slave maidens sparkling in jewelled <b>trappings.</b> Brilliant cloths <b>of</b> many hues and strange patterns formed the soft cushion covering of the dais upon which they reclined about her.|$|R
60|$|The beasts {{were hung}} with jeweled <b>trappings</b> and saddlepads <b>of</b> gay silk, {{embroidered}} in fanciful designs with strings of diamonds, pearls, rubies, emeralds, and the countless unnamed jewels of Mars, while from each chariot rose a dozen standards from which streamers, flags, and pennons fluttered in the breeze.|$|R
5|$|Read {{retired from}} {{military}} life on 20 March 1975 and was succeeded by Air Marshal James Rowland, {{who later became}} Governor of New South Wales. Considered disdainful of bureaucracy {{and some of the}} <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> high office, Read refused to sit for the traditional portrait painted of former Chiefs of the Air Staff. As CAS during the Whitlam Labor government, which was generally antipathetic to imperial knighthoods, he was not raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) until the 1976 Queen's Birthday Honours, after the Liberal Party under Malcolm Fraser had been returned to power. Originally from Vaucluse, in Sydney's east, by 2010 Read was living in Safety Beach, on the New South Wales Mid North Coast. He died at Woolgoolga and District Retirement Village on 17September 2014.|$|E
5|$|Limited toleration and the {{influence}} of exiled Scots and Protestants in other countries, led to the expansion of Protestantism, with a group of lairds declaring themselves Lords of the Congregation in 1557 and representing their interests politically. The collapse of the French alliance and English intervention in 1560 meant that a relatively small, but highly influential, group of Protestants were in a position to impose reform on the Scottish church. A confession of faith, rejecting papal jurisdiction and the mass, was adopted by Parliament in 1560, while the young Mary, Queen of Scots was still in France. Knox, having escaped the galleys and spent time in Geneva, where he became a follower of Calvin, emerged as the most significant figure. The Calvinism of the reformers led by Knox resulted in a settlement that adopted a Presbyterian system and rejected most of the elaborate <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> the Medieval church. This gave considerable power within the new kirk to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy, and resulting in widespread, but generally orderly, iconoclasm. At this point {{the majority of the population}} was probably still Catholic in persuasion and the kirk would find it difficult to penetrate the Highlands and Islands, but began a gradual process of conversion and consolidation that, compared with reformations elsewhere, was conducted with relatively little persecution.|$|E
5|$|Segrè was {{appointed}} {{assistant professor of}} physics at the University of Rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936, becoming one of the Via Panisperna boys. In 1934, he met Elfriede Spiro, a Jewish woman whose family had come from Ostrowo in West Prussia, but had fled to Breslau when that part of Prussia became part of Poland after World War I. After the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933, she had emigrated to Italy, where she worked as a secretary and an interpreter. At first she did not speak Italian well, and Segrè and Spiro conversed in German, in which he was fluent. The two were married at the Great Synagogue of Rome on 2 February 1936. He agreed with the rabbi to spend the minimal amount on the wedding, giving the balance of what would be spent on a luxury wedding to Jewish refugees from Germany. The rabbi managed to give them many of the <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> a luxury wedding anyway. The couple had three children: Claudio, born in 1937, Amelia Gertrude Allegra, born in 1937, and Fausta Irene, born in 1945.|$|E
60|$|As {{the dead}} hand relaxed its grasp upon Tara's wrist the girl leaped forward, without a {{backward}} glance, to Gahan's side. His left arm encircled her, {{nor did she}} draw away, as with ready sword the Gatholian awaited Fate's next decree. Before them Tara's deliverer was wiping the blood from his sword upon the hair of his victim. He was evidently a Manatorian, his <b>trappings</b> those <b>of</b> the Jeddak's Guard, and so his act was inexplicable to Gahan and to Tara. Presently he sheathed his sword and approached them.|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to experimentally test the hypothesis that a positive correlation exists between weight of accipters and the weight of their prey. Sharp-shinned hawks (Accipiter striatus) and northern goshawks (A. gentilis) were selected for the study due to their abundance during migration, ease <b>of</b> <b>trappings,</b> and differences in weight...|$|R
50|$|Because {{the missionaries}} were small in number, they {{increasingly}} placed religious responsibilities {{in the hands}} of trusted members of the villages. The village mayor or alcalde was charged with the responsibility of leading the villagers in a procession to Sunday Mass. Over time, these processions were conducted with greater ceremony, making use <b>of</b> <b>trappings</b> such as crosses, incense, and music.|$|R
25|$|Use of obscurantist language, {{and use of}} {{apparently}} technical jargon in {{an effort}} to give claims the superficial <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> science.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, social parvenus {{who took}} on the {{external}} <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> the noble classes (such as the wearing of a sword) were severely criticised, sometimes by legal action; laws on sumptuous clothing worn by bourgeois existed since the Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|On 31 December 1924, MVSN consuls {{met with}} Mussolini {{and gave him}} an ultimatum—crush the {{opposition}} or they would do so without him. Fearing a revolt by his own militants, Mussolini decided to drop all <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> democracy.|$|E
50|$|Ennis {{returned}} to Marvel, reuniting with artist Goran Parlov, with Fury: My War Gone By in 2013. In keeping with Ennis's subversion of superhero tropes, the MAX series stripped Nick Fury {{of his more}} science fiction <b>trappings</b> in favour <b>of</b> real-world military and CIA situations, centering on the First Indochina War. That same year, with artist Howard Chaykin, Ennis wrote the 7 issue Dynamite miniseries Red Team.|$|R
50|$|Tension between Daly and the IRA {{reached its}} peak in 1983 when Daly banned requiem mass with the body present, and forbade {{military}} <b>trappings,</b> at funerals <b>of</b> paramilitaries. The ban came after Daly negotiated {{an agreement with the}} IRA that there be no guns present at funerals, which the IRA breached when several of its members fired shots over a coffin during a ceremony.|$|R
50|$|The Cream Hill Agricultural School {{property}} {{is located on}} 400 acre in northern Cornwall, a rural community in the northwestern hills of Connecticut. The main farmstead is found {{on the west side}} of Cream Hill Road, nort of its junction with Wadsworth Road. In additions to more modern farm <b>trappings,</b> much <b>of</b> its historic educational complex survives. This includes a c. 1770 2-1/2 story farmhouse, to which a 1-1/2 story ell was added about 1840. A second wing was added in 1845, specifically for use as classroom space. This two-story flat-roofed structure was enlarged in 1850 with a similar section topped by a square turret. Standing west of this complex are sheds and barns of 19th-century vintage.|$|R
25|$|Azure on {{a cloudy}} fess argent, {{together}} with three stars Or, two in chief {{and one in}} point, dextrochère armed, sable, moving from sinister side of the shield and holding a sword high Or, quarter and <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> the towns of second order.|$|E
25|$|The {{marketing}} {{of breast cancer}} awareness allows people to incorporate support for awareness into their personal identity or lifestyle. Socially aware, pro-woman individuals, businesses, politicians, and organizations use pink ribbons and other <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> breast cancer awareness to signal their support for women, health, and mainstream medicine.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} Majeerteen Sultanate, the Sultanate of Hobyo exerted a strong {{centralized}} authority during its existence, and possessed {{all of the}} organs and <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> an integrated modern state: a functioning bureaucracy, a hereditary nobility, titled aristocrats, a state flag, {{as well as a}} professional army. Both sultanates also maintained written records of their activities, which still exist.|$|E
6000|$|If Mr. Nicholson died, it {{was down}} this same road he must journey to the grave; and down this road, on the same errand, his wife had preceded him years before; and many other leading citizens, with the proper <b>trappings</b> and {{attendance}} <b>of</b> the end. And now, in that frosty, ill-smelling, straw- carpeted, and ragged-cushioned cab, with his breath congealing on the glasses, where else was John himself advancing to? ...|$|R
60|$|Together {{they buried}} the knights {{at the bottom}} of the dry moat at the back of the ruined castle. First they had {{stripped}} them and, when they took account of the spoils of the combat, they found themselves richer by three horses with full <b>trappings,</b> many pieces <b>of</b> gold and silver money, ornaments and jewels, as well as the lances, swords and chain mail armor of their erstwhile guests.|$|R
40|$|Westminster sits in {{the centre}} of the countries’ major city, {{physically}} accessible from great portions of the country by both rail and car, with citizens in theory able to meet their representatives should they wish to do so. So why does the Palace of Westminster feel so remote? Ben West argues that Westminster has all <b>of</b> the <b>trappings</b> and atmosphere <b>of</b> a private members’ club, and that has to change...|$|R
25|$|Rawat {{inherited}} the first organization he {{was associated with}} (Divine Light Mission) from his father. Moving away from the <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> Indian culture and religion, he later established Elan Vital and Words of Peace International, independent of culture, beliefs and lifestyles, and not bound to the traditions of India. The Prem Rawat Foundation (TPRF) founded in 2001, added more focus to humanitarian efforts.|$|E
25|$|The film used period accurate, life-size working {{aeroplane}} {{models and}} replicas {{to create an}} early 20th century airfield, at the Brookley Motor Racing Track (fashioned after Brooklands where early automotive racing and aviators shared the facilities for testing). All Brookley's associated <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> structures, aircraft and vehicles (including a rare 1907 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, estimated to be worth 50 million dollars) {{were part of the}} exterior set at Booker Airfield, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England.|$|E
25|$|Debendranath Tagore {{took over}} the reins of the Brahmo Samaj in 1843 and not only resurrected it but also enriched it in many ways. It became the {{inspiration}} for the Bengal Renaissance. It was he who gave the Brahmo movement the <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> a separate faith and introduced its own unique rituals. The Brahmo Samaj cast a very wide-ranging influence on its parent Hindu society, much wider than its limited membership would ostensibly permit.|$|E
5000|$|A larger {{version of}} the work, by the same artist, is venerated in the Catedral de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción (Cathedral of our Lady of the Assumption, Popayán) in Popayán, Colombia. This larger Virgin, known as Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Popayán (Our Lady of the Assumption of Popayán), strikes a more exaggerated “dancing” pose atop a {{crescent}} moon and serpent, and prepares to strike the latter with a lightning bolt, which replaces the earlier work's heavy silver chain. Ironically, both of these figures carry the iconographic <b>trappings</b> more <b>of</b> the Woman of the Apocalypse than of an “Immaculate Conception” (the colors and white, the floating) or an “Assumption” (the wings, the upraised arms), although elements of all three Marian [...] "epithets" [...] are present.|$|R
60|$|The {{captain was}} not a man to refuse {{assistance}} to any one in distress, especially when there was a woman in the case; horses were immediately dispatched, with an escort, to aid the unfortunate couple. The next day they made their appearance with all their effects; the man, a stalwart mountaineer, with a peculiarly game look; the woman, a young Blackfoot beauty, arrayed in the <b>trappings</b> and trinketry <b>of</b> a free trapper's bride.|$|R
5000|$|Laibach's {{method is}} {{extremely}} simple, effective and horribly open to misinterpretation. First of all, they absorb the mannerisms of the enemy, adopting all the seductive <b>trappings</b> and symbols <b>of</b> state power, {{and then they}} exaggerate everything {{to the edge of}} parody... Next they turn their focus to highly charged issues [...] - [...] the West's fear of immigrants from Eastern Europe, the power games of the EU, the analogies between Western democracy and totalitarianism.|$|R
