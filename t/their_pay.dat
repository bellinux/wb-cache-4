5|$|As Jake {{attempts}} {{to book a}} gig, the mystery woman blows up the phone booth he is using; once again, he is miraculously unhurt. The band stumbles into a gig at Bob's Country Bunker, a local honky-tonk. They win over the rowdy crowd, but run up a bar tab higher than <b>their</b> <b>pay,</b> and infuriate the country band that was actually booked for the gig, the Good Ol' Boys.|$|E
5|$|As the show's revenue {{continued}} to rise through syndication and DVD sales, the main cast stopped appearing for script readings in April 2004. The work stoppage occurred after weeks of unsuccessful negotiations with Fox, in which the cast asked {{for an increase in}} <b>their</b> <b>pay</b> to $360,000 per episode, or $8 million over a 22-episode season. The strike was resolved a month later and their salary was raised to something between $250,000 and $360,000 per episode.|$|E
5|$|As was {{standard}} practice, Colvill {{was subsequently}} tried by court martial aboard Africaine on 31 December {{for the loss}} of his ship. The court acquitted him, his officers and his men of all blame. The court found the cause of the accident to be the thick fog and the ignorance of the pilots. The court required the pilots to forfeit <b>their</b> <b>pay,</b> barred them from piloting any of His Majesty's ships, and imprisoned them for a time in the Marshalsea.|$|E

5|$|By mid-July, Maximilian and the Swabian leaders {{suddenly}} {{were under}} pressure from their own troops. In the west, where there lay an army {{under the command of}} count Heinrich von Fürstenberg, a large contingent of mercenaries from Flanders and many knights threatened to leave as they had not received <b>their</b> <b>pay.</b> The foot soldiers of the Swabian troops also complained: most of them were peasants and preferred to go home and bring in the harvest. Maximilian was forced to act.|$|E
5|$|In December 1941, black mine {{workers at}} various sites in Katanga Province, {{including}} Jadotville and Élisabethville, went on strike, demanding that <b>their</b> <b>pay</b> be increased from 1.50 francs to 2 francs {{to compensate for}} rising living costs. The strike started on 3 December, and {{by the next day}} 1,400 workers had downed tools. All UMHK sites were affected by 9 December. The strike was also fuelled by other grievances against the colonial order and segregation.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Domitian {{appears to}} have been very popular among the soldiers, {{spending}} an estimated three years of his reign among the army on campaigns—more than any emperor since Augustus—and raising <b>their</b> <b>pay</b> by one-third. While the army command may have disapproved of his tactical and strategic decisions, the loyalty of the common soldier was unquestioned.|$|E

5|$|All {{that changed}} with the {{assassination}} of Tsar Alexander II. The mourning for the tsar meant {{there would be no}} performances in the capital; in addition the political climate of Russia turned sharply against the Jews. Goldfaden's troupe soldiered on for a time—to Minsk, to Bobruisk where they played mainly to Russian soldiers, and to Vitebsk, where he and Sonya ended up having to sue Goldfaden for <b>their</b> <b>pay,</b> and left to rejoin Rosenberg, who was playing in a tent theater in Nezhin. However, matters there proved even worse: Nezhin soon fell prey to a pogrom. The troupe managed to avoid bodily harm, partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden.|$|E
5|$|Butlin {{proposed}} a new holiday camp at Clacton-on-Sea in Essex in 1936. Both {{the council and}} the local association of hotels were against the idea, as were the boarding house keepers. To persuade them, Butlin took {{the members of the}} council to Skegness to see how the people there appreciated their holiday camp. The councillors were soon won over when they learnt that the local traders in Skegness had seen an initial dip in custom after its construction followed by a rise as campers had visited the town and seasonal workers had come to spend <b>their</b> <b>pay.</b> Once approved by the council, construction began and the camp opened in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Fuqua {{was fired}} on October 1, 2004, four weeks before {{principal}} photography would begin. The studio cited creative differences for the director's departure. After Fuqua's departure, the studio met with Peter Berg {{to take over}} directing the film, and Denzel Washington had approved of the choice. Due to the search potentially escalating a budget already in the US$80million range and the difficulty in recouping the amount based on the film's subject matter, Universal canceled production of American Gangster, citing time constraints and creative elements for its reason. The cancellation cost the studio $30million, of which $20million went to Washington and $5million went to del Toro due to <b>their</b> <b>pay</b> or play contracts.|$|E
50|$|In June 1989 its {{employees}} stopped receiving <b>their</b> <b>pays,</b> decided {{to organize and}} formed a union which took over operations, changing its name to Diario Co Latino.

5|$|Macrinus {{had several}} {{issues that he}} needed to deal with {{at the time of his}} accession, which had been left behind by his predecessor. As Caracalla had a {{tendency}} towards military belligerence, rather than diplomacy, this left several conflicts for Macrinus to resolve. Additionally, Caracalla had been a profligate spender of Rome's income. Most of the money was spent on the army; he had greatly increased <b>their</b> <b>pay</b> from 2,000 sesterces to 3,000 sesterces per year. The increased expenditures forced Caracalla to strip bare whatever sources of income he had to supply the difference. This shortfall left Rome in a dire fiscal situation that Macrinus needed to address.|$|E
5|$|Richard Armitage {{secured the}} role of Lee {{when he arrived at}} his {{audition}} wearing a pair of old boots, something that greatly impressed producer Spencer Campbell. In order to match the scripted description of his character, Armitage began a heavy workout regimen and took aqua-aerobics lessons to better understand Lee's profession. His first scene was a sex scene with Ramona. Despite leaving the series in 2001, Fay Ripley was persuaded to return to the programme for one last appearance as Jenny in the final episode. To make sure the rest of the cast agreed to return, their salaries were increased to £75,000 per episode, a 50% increase on <b>their</b> <b>pay</b> for the fourth series (though Joseph earned less).|$|E
5|$|Attitudes of the Russian {{space program}} and NASA towards Phase One were also {{of concern to}} the astronauts involved. Because of Russia's {{financial}} issues, many workers at the TsUP felt that the mission hardware and continuation of Mir {{was more important than}} the lives of the cosmonauts aboard the station. As such the program was run very differently compared to American programs: cosmonauts had their days being planned for them to the minute, actions (such as docking) which would be performed manually by shuttle pilots were all carried out automatically, and cosmonauts had <b>their</b> <b>pay</b> docked if they made any errors during their flights. Americans learned aboard Skylab and earlier space missions that this level of control was not productive and had since made mission plans more flexible. The Russians, however, would not budge, and many felt that significant work time was lost because of this.|$|E
60|$|Another {{plan which}} was resorted to was the {{granting}} of what was called monopolies: that is, the government would select some important and necessary articles in general use, and give the exclusive right of manufacturing them to certain persons, on <b>their</b> <b>paying</b> {{a part of the}} profits to the government. Soap was one of the articles thus chosen. The exclusive right to manufacture it was given to a company, on <b>their</b> <b>paying</b> for it. So with leather, salt, and various other things. These persons, when they once possessed the exclusive right to manufacture an article which the people must use, would abuse their power by deteriorating the article, or charging enormous prices. Nothing prevented their doing this, as they had no competition. The effect was, that the people were injured much more than the government was benefited. The plan of granting such monopolies by governments is now universally odious.|$|R

5|$|Before 2009, members {{received}} the same salary as members of their national parliament. However, from 2009 a new members statute came into force, after years of attempts, which gave all members an equal monthly pay, of 8,020.53 euro each in 2014, subject to a European Union tax and which can also be taxed nationally. MEPs {{are entitled to a}} pension, paid by Parliament, from the age of 63. Members are also entitled to allowances for office costs and subsistence, and travelling expenses, based on actual cost. Besides <b>their</b> <b>pay,</b> members are granted a number of privileges and immunities. To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament, they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior officials travelling abroad and, by other state governments, the status of visiting foreign representatives. When in their own state, they have all the immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and, in other states, they have immunity from detention and legal proceedings. However, immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offence and the Parliament also has the right to strip a member of their immunity.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Fraser {{returned}} to Toronto {{and took up}} her research post, simultaneously working as a demonstrator with the Department of Hygiene and Preventative Medicine. She {{was one of the}} founding faculty of the School of Hygiene at U of T. She made her home with her brother Donald; Williams, who had also returned from England, moved in with her own mother. Though the two women wanted to live together, raise children and continue their careers, they were unwilling to displease or fail in their obligations to their mothers. They also realized that though they were middle-class, working women, economic inequalities in <b>their</b> <b>pay</b> compromised their ability to support themselves and their need to remain in the good graces of their families for support. When Williams was bequeathed a farm near Aurora, Ontario, the couple believed it might become their haven, but when Williams applied for courses at the Ontario School of Agriculture, she was advised the courses were full. For the next several years, they lived apart but within a 30-minute walk from each other at various residences.|$|E
5|$|In June 1783, a {{different}} group of disgruntled soldiers from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, sent Congress a petition demanding their back pay. When {{they began to}} march toward Philadelphia, Congress charged Hamilton and two others with intercepting the mob. Hamilton requested militia from Pennsylvania's Supreme Executive Council, but was turned down. Hamilton instructed Assistant Secretary of War William Jackson to intercept the men. Jackson was unsuccessful. The mob arrived in Philadelphia, and the soldiers proceeded to harangue Congress for <b>their</b> <b>pay.</b> The President of the Continental Congress, John Dickinson, feared that the Pennsylvania state militia was unreliable, and refused its help. Hamilton argued that Congress ought to adjourn to Princeton, New Jersey. Congress agreed, and relocated there. Frustrated with {{the weakness of the}} central government, Hamilton while in Princeton drafted a call to revise the Articles of Confederation. This resolution contained many features of the future U.S. Constitution, including a strong federal government with the ability to collect taxes and raise an army. It also included the separation of powers into the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches.|$|E

50|$|Since 2005 club president, Luís Filipe Vieira, {{implemented}} {{an aggressive}} membership campaign {{with the intent}} of reaching 300,000 members. From roughly 95,000 members in 2000, the club reached 160,000 in 2006, a Guinness World record, only one year after the beginning of the campaign. In the scheduled renumbering of 2015, Benfica dropped from 247,859 to 156,916 members, losing roughly 35% of <b>their</b> <b>paying</b> associates.|$|R
5|$|On March31 {{the insurgents}} kept their {{part of the}} {{agreement}} by allowing the supply bill to be passed on second reading and the budget to be hoisted for ninety days. However, when the cabinet introduced its promised bill, the insurgents claimed {{that it was not}} as agreed and refused to support it. Instead, they demanded Aberhart's resignation and announced that they were prepared to take over the government within 24hours. A delegation put this demand to Aberhart in the evening of March31; according to them, he agreed to resign if they allowed the supply bill to pass a third reading. They did so, but Aberhart denied that he had agreed to resign and refused to do so unless he was defeated in a general election. The insurgents, leery of Aberhart's oratorical powers and the reach of his weekly radio show, wanted to avoid an election. Even so, they rejected a motion by Low to raise <b>their</b> <b>pay</b> for the session by $200, seeing it as a crass bribe.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the Teutonic Knights was resounding. According to Teutonic payroll records, only 1,427 men {{reported}} back to Marienburg to claim <b>their</b> <b>pay.</b> Of 1,200 men sent from Danzig, only 300 returned. Between 203 and 211 brothers of the Order were killed, out of 270 that participated in battle, including much of the Teutonic leadership—Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen, Grand Marshal Friedrich von Wallenrode, Grand Komtur Kuno von Lichtenstein, Grand Treasurer Thomas von Merheim, Marshal of Supply Forces Albrecht von Schwartzburg, and ten of the komturs. Markward von Salzbach, Komtur of Brandenburg (Ushakovo) and Heinrich Schaumburg, voigt of Sambia, were executed by order of Vytautas after the battle. The bodies of von Jungingen and other high-ranking officials were transported to Marienburg Castle for burial on 19 July. The bodies of lower-ranking Teutonic officials and 12 Polish knights were buried at the church in Tannenberg. The rest of the dead were buried in several mass graves. The highest-ranking Teutonic official to escape the battle was Werner von Tettinger, Komtur of Elbing (Elbląg).|$|E
5|$|While Hamilton was in Congress, discontented {{soldiers}} {{began to}} pose {{a danger to the}} young United States. Most of the army was then posted at Newburgh, New York. Those in the army were paying for much of their own supplies, and they had not been paid in eight months. Furthermore, the Continental officers had been promised, in May 1778, after Valley Forge, a pension of half <b>their</b> <b>pay</b> when they were discharged. By the early 1780s, due to the structure of the government under the Articles of Confederation, it had no power to tax to either raise revenue or pay its soldiers. In 1782 after several months without pay, a group of officers organized to send a delegation to lobby Congress, led by Capt. Alexander McDougall. The officers had three demands: the Army's pay, their own pensions, and commutation of those pensions into a lump-sum payment if Congress were unable to afford the half-salary pensions for life. Congress rejected the proposal.|$|E
