40|$|I examine here how Sumner’s {{concept of}} <b>the</b> <b>mores</b> applies <b>to</b> modern urban society&mdash;in {{particular}} to law as an epiphenomenon of <b>the</b> <b>mores</b> {{rather than an}} influence on them. Strongly-held mores are rare in contem-porary societies. Rather, submores pervade, causing conflict among antag-onistic interests. Law can sometimes bridge these submores, as in labor-management conflict. Law can also provide a framework within which pervasive mores may evolve. For these reasons, law can and does contribute much <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mores</b> of complex urban societies than Sumner perceived. 1 ntroduction William Graham Sumner, the great Yale sociologist, influ-enced generations of social scientists by his view of law as an epiphenomenon (Sumner 1906 : 53, 209), a position partially em-bodied by his disciples in the resounding metaphor, &dquo;law nm-ning counter <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mores</b> cannot stand. &dquo; The master himself put it this way: &dquo;Acts of legislation come out of <b>the</b> <b>mores</b> [...] Legislation [...] . has to seek standing ground on the exist...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} special worship events {{have been held}} since the renovation. They have taken {{advantage}} of the cover, temperature control, and enhanced security. However, in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> recent programs, one early event occurred in September 1983, even before the modern renovation. At that time U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff was allowed to hold an unusual interfaith service—the first interfaith service ever conducted at the Wall during the time it was under Israeli control—that included men and women sitting together. The ten-minute service included the Priestly Blessing, recited by Resnicoff, who is a Kohen. A Ministry of Religions representative was present, responding to press queries that the service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.|$|E
5|$|A style more melodic {{and more}} akin to the hard rock of bands like Rainbow, Magnum, UFO, Thin Lizzy and Whitesnake was equally {{represented}} during the NWOBHM. The music of Def Leppard, Praying Mantis, White Spirit, Demon, Shy, Gaskin, Dedringer and many others, contained hooks as much as riffs, often retained a closer link with blues rock, included power ballads and featured keyboards, acoustic instruments and melodic and soaring vocals. After {{the peak of the}} movement in 1981, this style was favoured by the media and gained greater acceptance among the British audience; it became prevalent when bands usually playing the more aggressive style of metal adapted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> popular sound, which resembled that of mainstream American acts. These changes in musical direction disoriented some fans and led them to reject those bands which were perceived as having compromised key elements of their musical identity in the pursuit of success.|$|E

5|$|Access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> northerly (Bakerloo) part of {{the station}} is via the {{original}} building, while the exit is via a new extension next to Skipton House. Between the entrance and two shops is the entrance to South London House, an office block above the station. The BS station building remains much as originally constructed and is a typical Leslie Green structure. The main alteration is a modern glass-sided and glass-topped flat-roofed extension abutting the original western elevation, giving access to three of the six arches. These arches, in a classic deep-red faience style, formed the original perimeter: two are infilled with street-facing shops. As the station also functions as a drivers' depot, London Underground uses the offices above the station for administration and drivers' accommodation.|$|E
5|$|Active {{elliptical}} galaxies of a form {{similar to}} M87 {{are believed to}} form {{as a result of}} one or more mergers between smaller galaxies. There is now little dust remaining to form the diffuse nebulae where new stars were created, so the stellar population is dominated by old, population II stars that contain relatively low abundances of elements other than hydrogen and helium. M87's elliptical shape is maintained by random orbital motions of its member stars, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> orderly rotational motions found in a spiral galaxy such as the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Advance {{elements}} of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5, during the first battle between American and North Korean forces. The force at the battle, Task Force Smith, retreated from Osan, and U.S. forces were again defeated in the Battle of Pyongtaek. For over {{a week after the}} defeat of Task Force Smith, 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the North Korean force's superior numbers and equipment. The regiments of the 24th Infantry Division were systematically pushed south at and around Chochiwon, Chonan, Pyongtaek, Hadong, and Yechon. These American soldiers, most of whom had experienced only occupation duty in Japan and no actual combat, were unprepared compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> disciplined North Korean units.|$|E
