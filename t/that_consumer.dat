25|$|By mid-1930, {{interest}} rates {{had dropped to}} low levels, but expected deflation and the continuing reluctance of people to borrow meant <b>that</b> <b>consumer</b> spending and investment were depressed. By May 1930, automobile sales had declined to below the levels of 1928. Prices in general began to decline, although wages held steady in 1930. Then a deflationary spiral started in 1931. Conditions were worse in farming areas, where commodity prices plunged and in mining and logging areas, where unemployment was high and there were few other jobs.|$|E
25|$|For the consumer, channel {{switching}} offers {{a more diverse}} shopping experience. However, marketers need to be alert to {{channel switching}} because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and <b>that</b> <b>consumer</b> behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheaper, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply {{because it is more}} convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping). As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.|$|E

In addition, the probability <b>that</b> the <b>consumers</b> buy Prosecco CDO is positively affected by the purchase of the product at a hypermarket. On the contrary, the probability <b>that</b> the <b>consumers</b> buy Prosecco CDO, negatively depends on the fact <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> belong to maturing families and/or older couples; are aged between 45 – 54; belong to a segment of low income earners and live in households composed of three members or more.

25|$|The energy {{released}} in a static electricity discharge may vary {{over a wide}} range. The energy in joules can be calculated from the capacitance (C) of the object and the static potential V in volts (V) by the formula E= ½CV2. One experimenter estimates the capacitance {{of the human body}} as high as 400 picofarads, and a charge of 50,000 volts, discharged e.g. during touching a charged car, creating a spark with energy of 500 millijoules. Another estimate is 100–300 pF and 20,000 volts, producing a maximum energy of 60 mJ. IEC 479-2:1987 states that a discharge with energy greater than 5000 mJ is a direct serious risk to human health. IEC 60065 states <b>that</b> <b>consumer</b> products cannot discharge more than 350 mJ into a person.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to clarify how product familiarity and product involvement can moderate the importance <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> place on COO image when they evaluate products for purchase or consumption. The authors adopted a contingency approach and empirically examined, {{by way of}} competing hypotheses, the alternative possibilities by which product familiarity and product involvement may influence the importance <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> place on COO image when they evaluate products. Design/methodology/approach – Data were gathered from 388 consumers in Australia across four different product classes. Data analysis was conducted using hierarchical regression analysis with interactions and post hoc slope analysis. Findings – Overall, the study {{findings suggest that the}} importance <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> place on COO image when they evaluate products is contingent on the product context. Specifically, the study findings show <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> consider COO image to be more important for their product evaluations when they evaluate products from less familiar product categories and are less involved with the products that they are evaluating. An additional variable included in the study, product origin congruency, was found to enhance the importance <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> place on COO image when they evaluate products. Originality/value – There are competing views in the literature as to how product familiarity and product involvement can moderate the importance <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> place on COO image when they evaluate products. This study further clarifies the moderating role of product familiarity and product involvement. The study also examines the potential moderating role of product origin congruency in a survey for the first time...|$|R

2500|$|When labeled {{irradiated}} food {{is offered}} for retail sale, these consumers buy it and re-purchase it, indicating {{that it is}} possible to successfully market irradiated foods, therefore retailers not stocking irratiated foods might be a major bottleneck to wider adption of irrated foods. It is however, widely believed <b>that</b> <b>consumer</b> perception of foods treated with irradiation is more negative than those processed by other means and some industry studies indicate the number of consumers concerned about the safety of irradiated food decreased between 1985 and 1995 to levels comparable to those of people concerned about food additives and preservatives. Even though is it is untrue [...] "People think the product is radioactive," [...] said Harlan Clemmons, president of Sadex, a food irradiation company based in Sioux City, Iowa. Because of these concerns and the increased cost of irradiated foods, there is not a widespread public demand for the irradiation of foods for human consumption.|$|E
2500|$|Psychiatrist Ernst Simmel first defined {{primordial}} narcissism in 1944. [...] Simmel's fundamental {{thesis is}} that the most primitive stage of libidinal development is not the oral, but the gastrointestinal one. Mouth and anus are merely to be considered as the terminal parts of this organic zone. Simmel terms the psychological condition of prenatal existence [...] "primordial narcissism." [...] It is the vegetative stage of the pre-ego, identical with the id. At this stage there is complete instinctual repose, manifested in unconsciousness. Satiation of the gastrointestinal zone, {{the representative of the}} instinct of self-preservation, can bring back this complete instinctual repose, which, under pathological conditions, can become the aim of the instinct. Contrary to Lasch, Bernard Stiegler argues in his book, Acting Out, <b>that</b> <b>consumer</b> capitalism is in fact destructive of what he calls primordial narcissism, without which {{it is not possible to}} extend love to others. In other words, he is referring to the natural state of an infant as a fetus and in the first few days of its life, before it has learned that other people exist besides itself, and therefore cannot possibly be aware that they are human beings with feelings, rather than having anything to do with actual narcissism.|$|E
2500|$|The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 1993 was {{the second}} main measure. Under article 3(1) a term is unfair, and not binding, {{if it is not}} [...] "individually negotiated| and [...] "if, {{contrary}} to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract, {{to the detriment of the}} consumer". The Court of Justice has continually affirmed that the Directive, as recital 16 states, [...] "is based on the idea that the consumer is in a weak position vis-à-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge". Terms which are very skewed, are to be conclusively regarded as contrary to [...] "good faith" [...] and therefore unfair. For example, in RWE AG v Verbraucherzentrale NRW eV clauses in gas supply contracts enabling corporation, RWE, to unilaterally vary prices were advised by the Court of Justice to be not sufficiently transparent, and therefore unfair. In Brusse v Jahani BV the Court of Justice advised that clauses in a tenancy contract requiring tenants pay €25 per day were likely unfair, and would have to be entirely void without replacement, if they were not substituted with more precise mandatory terms in national legislation. In Aziz v Caixa d'Estalvis de Catalunya, following the global financial crisis, the Court of Justice advised that even terms regarding repossession of homes in Spain had to be assessed for fairness by national courts. In Kušionová v SMART Capital a.s., the Court of Justice held <b>that</b> <b>consumer</b> law was to be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights, including the right to housing, in the event that a home could be repossessed. Because consumer law operates through Directives, national courts have the final say on applying the general principles set out by the Court of Justice's case law.|$|E
