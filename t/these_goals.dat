5|$|In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb {{proposed}} that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted {{from a list}} by Daniel Callahan). To implement <b>these</b> <b>goals,</b> {{he pointed out that}} accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year curriculum for a single class on the subject.|$|E

Her aim is to educate women to be useful wives and mothers, because, she argues, it is through these roles that they can most effectively contribute to society. The predominantly domestic role Wollstonecraft outlines for womena role that she viewed as meaningfulwas interpreted by 20th-century feminist literary critics as paradoxically confining them to the private sphere.|$|E

The attack crippled much of the U.S. battleship fleet.

5|$|One {{adviser to}} Khrushchev was Trofim Lysenko, who promised greatly {{increased}} production with minimal investment. Such schemes were attractive to Khrushchev, who ordered them implemented. Lysenko managed {{to maintain his}} influence under Khrushchev despite repeated failures; as each proposal failed, he advocated another. Lysenko's influence greatly retarded the development of genetic science in the Soviet Union. In 1959, Khrushchev announced a goal of overtaking the United States in production of milk, meat, and butter. Local officials, with Khrushchev's encouragement, made unrealistic pledges of production. <b>These</b> <b>goals</b> were met by forcing farmers to slaughter their breeding herds and by purchasing meat at state stores, then reselling {{it back to the}} government, artificially increasing recorded production.|$|E
40|$|Goals {{are central}} to the design and {{implementation}} of intelligent software agents. Much of the literature on goals and reasoning about goals in agent programming frameworks only deals with a limited set of goal types, typically achievement goals, and sometimes maintenance goals. In this paper we extend a previously proposed unifying framework for goals with additional richer goal types that are explicitly represented as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulae. We show that <b>these</b> <b>goal</b> types can be modelled as a combination of achieve and maintain goals. This is done by providing an operationalization of <b>these</b> new <b>goal</b> types, and showing that the operationalization generates computation traces that satisfy the temporal formula.
