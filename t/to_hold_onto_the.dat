5|$|Despite its post-revolutionary mythology, {{the march}} {{was not a}} {{spontaneous}} event. Numerous calls for a mass demonstration at Versailles had already been made; the Marquis of Saint-Huruge, one of the popular orators of the Palais-Royal, had called for just such a march in August to evict the obstructionist deputies who, he claimed, were protecting the king's veto power. Although his efforts were foiled, revolutionaries continued <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> idea of a march on Versailles to compel the king to accept the Assembly's laws. Speakers at the Palais-Royal mentioned it regularly throughout the next month, creating enduring suspicions of the proprietor, Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. The idea of a march on Versailles was widespread, and was even discussed {{in the pages of}} the Mercure de France (5 September 1789). A menacing unrest was in the air, and many nobles and foreigners fled the oppressive atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|When hunting larger animals, tigers {{prefer to}} bite the throat and use their {{powerful}} forelimbs <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> prey, often simultaneously wrestling it to the ground. The tiger remains latched onto the neck until its target dies of strangulation. By this method, gaurs and water buffaloes weighing over a ton {{have been killed by}} tigers weighing about a sixth as much. Although they can kill healthy adults, tigers often select the calves or infirm of very large species. Healthy adult prey of this type can be dangerous to tackle, as long, strong horns, legs and tusks are all potentially fatal to the tiger. No other extant land predator routinely takes on prey this large on their own. Whilst hunting sambars, which comprise up to 60% of their prey in India, tigers have reportedly made a passable impersonation of the male sambar's rutting call to attract them.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the things}} that cause the most {{confusion}} for people that are not familiar with the game are the Holding the Ball, Dropping the Ball, and Throwing rules. Confusion arises because a player being tackled is not allowed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ball, but is not allowed to throw it either.|$|E

25|$|The ALP's {{success in}} 1999 and 2002 was {{partly due to}} its success in {{regional}} Victoria. <b>To</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> power, <b>the</b> ALP sought to retain seats outside Melbourne, and <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> its eastern suburban gains in 2002.|$|R

25|$|The Thirteenth Dynasty proved unable <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> long land of Egypt, and {{a provincial}} family of Levantine descent {{located in the}} marshes of the eastern Delta at Avaris {{broke away from the}} central {{authority}} to form the Fourteenth Dynasty. The splintering of the land most likely happened shortly after the reigns of the powerful Thirteenth Dynasty pharaohs Neferhotep I and Sobekhotep IV c. 1720 BC.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, Mamma Mia! has grossed £69.2 {{million as}} of January 23, 2009, {{and is the}} ninth highest-grossing film of all time at the UK box office. The film opened at #1 in the U.K, taking £6.6 million on 496 screens. It managed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> top spot for 2 weeks, {{narrowly}} keeping Pixar's WALL-E from reaching #1 in its second week.|$|E
25|$|With daybreak on 21 November, it was {{discovered}} that the crest of the ridge was a Japanese outpost position, used during the day as an observation post and abandoned at night. Approaching Japanese soldiers who were preparing to take up positions were fired upon and they withdrew and fled down the hill. The enemy having regrouped and having been reinforced launched numerous attacks against Cibik's platoon, which itself had been reinforced by more machine guns and mortars, and was able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> crest despite fanatical attempts by the Japanese to reoccupy the position.|$|E

5000|$|Produced by Yoo Young-jin and co-written by Yoo and Yoo Han-jin, [...] "Catch Me" [...] is an electropop {{song with}} orchestral melodies, dubstep sounds, house beats, and {{powerful}} vocal belting. The lyrics {{are about a}} self-respected man who says good-bye to his lover but actually wants <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> her. <b>The</b> song was recorded in mid-2012 at the S.M. Blue Ocean Studios in Seoul, South Korea.|$|R
50|$|The strange {{autumn of}} 1740 pushed food prices back up, e.g., Dublin wheat prices on 20 December were {{at an all-time}} high. The {{widening}} wars in mid-December 1740 encouraged people with stored food <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> it. <b>The</b> populace needed food, and riots erupted again in various cities throughout the country. By December 1740, signs were growing that full-blown famine and epidemic were upon the citizens of Ireland.|$|R
25|$|Another {{meeting was}} held on 27 April, {{attended}} by Clemenceau, Foch, Milner, Wilson and Haig. Wilson pressed Foch on whether the priority was <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Channel Ports or to keep the British and French armies united. Foch indicated that the latter was the priority. British IX Corps {{was moved to the}} French sector. By the end of April Haig claimed to notice a slackening of enemy fighting spirit and on 30 April Ludendorff called a halt to the Flanders offensive, although he hoped to attack the British in Flanders again {{at some point in the}} future.|$|E
25|$|Between 1984 and 1986, {{military}} intelligence (G-2) maintained an operations {{center for the}} counterinsurgency programs in southwest Guatemala at the southern airbase at Retalhuleu. There, the G-2 operated a clandestine interrogation center for suspected insurgents and collaborators. Captured suspects were reportedly detained in water-filled pits along {{the perimeter of the}} base, which were covered with cages. In order to avoid drowning, prisoners were forced <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> cages over the pits. The bodies of prisoners tortured to death and live prisoners marked for disappearance were thrown out of IAI-201 Aravas by the Guatemalan Air Force over the Pacific Ocean ("death flights").|$|E
25|$|One common {{group of}} people that have visual memory {{problems}} are children with reading disabilities. It was often thought that disabilities are caused by failure to perceive the letters of a written word in the right order. However, studies show {{it is more likely that}} it is caused by a failure to encode and process the correct order of letters within the word. This means that the child perceives the word just as anyone else would, however their brains do not appear <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> visual characteristics of the word. Although initially it was found that children with reading disabilities had comparable visual memory to those without difficulty, a more specific part of the visual memory system has been found to cause reading disabilities.|$|E
50|$|The town {{lost its}} {{strategic}} importance after the Rákóczi-Liberation Wars of 1703-1711. Along with Szombathely, Kőszeg {{was the most}} important fortress for the kuruc military leadership from 1705-1708, <b>to</b> liberate and <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> areas west of the Rába.|$|R
5000|$|A typical flat {{consists}} of a nearly flat sole, and a minimal upper <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> it <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> foot. Frequently the thin insole is glued in place to reduce movement and weight. The sole is constructed of two materials: a engineered lightweight foam upper sole attached to a hard rubber base. The uppers are often mesh so that moisture can escape, even on crosscountry variants.|$|R
50|$|On 7 April 1918 {{the brigade}} entered the front on the Asiago Plateau, {{where it was}} {{surprised}} by the Austrian attack towards Vicenza during the Battle of the Piave River. In face of the massive Austrian offensive the brigade had to abandon all its forward positions and managed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> only <b>the</b> las lines of defense. With Austrian offensive bogging down the brigade managed to recapture part of the lost territory.|$|R
25|$|Cephalopods, as {{the name}} implies, have muscular {{appendages}} extending from their heads and surrounding their mouths. These are used in feeding, mobility, and even reproduction. In coleoids they number eight or ten. Decapods such as cuttlefish and squid have five pairs. The longer two, termed tentacles, are actively involved in capturing prey; they can lengthen rapidly (in as little as 15 milliseconds). In giant squid they may reach a length of 8 metres. They may terminate in a broadened, sucker-coated club. The shorter four pairs are termed arms, and are involved in holding and manipulating the captured organism. They too have suckers, on the side closest to the mouth; these help <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> prey. Octopods only have four pairs of sucker-coated arms, {{as the name}} suggests, though developmental abnormalities can modify the number of arms expressed.|$|E
25|$|In {{both males}} and females the legs are short and sturdy, with an {{enlarged}} tarsomere on the first pair, containing the silk-producing glands. The abdomen has ten segments, with a pair of cerci on the final segment. These cerci are highly sensitive to touch, and allow the animal to navigate while moving backwards through the gallery tunnels, which are too narrow to allow the insect to turn round. Because morphology is so similar between species, it makes species identification extremely difficult. For this reason, the main form of taxonomic identification used in the past has been close observation of distinctive copulatory structures of males, (although this method is now thought by some entomologists and taxonomists as giving insufficient classification detail). Although males never eat during their adult stage, they do have mouthparts similar to the females. These mouthparts are used <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> female during copulation.|$|E
25|$|Missouri amassed 418total {{yards to}} Oklahoma's 384. 361 of those Missouri yards game {{through the air}} {{compared}} to Oklahoma's 266. Both teams averaged 7.4yards per pass attempt. The Sooners managed 118yards on the ground while they held the Tigers to just 57. Both teams struggled <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ball. Oklahoma finished with two turnovers, both from Juaquin Iglesias, while Missouri had four, one fumble and three interceptions. Bradford finished the game completing 24 of his 34 passes with two touchdowns and no interceptions. Chris Brown led the team {{on the ground with}} 67rushing yards, 5.2yards per attempt and three touchdowns. Lofton was named the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Week for his performance in the game which included one fumble recovery returned for a touchdown, seven solo tackles and eleven assisted tackles. It was the third time an Oklahoma defensive player had received the award in seven weeks.|$|E

50|$|In New England, slave women went {{to court}} to gain their freedom while free black women went <b>to</b> court <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> theirs; <b>the</b> New England legal system was unique in its {{accessibility}} to free blacks {{and the availability of}} attorneys. Women's freedom suits were often based on technicalities, such as the lack of legal slave documents or mixed-race ancestry that exempted some from slave service. In New England in 1716, Joan Jackson became the first slave woman to win her freedom in a New England court.|$|R
50|$|The Bee Bee is a newer {{version of}} the Huss Swing Around that is usually themed {{relating}} to bumble bees. In this {{version of the}} ride, the ride features 10 cars that seat two passengers each which are restrained by an overhead lap bar. The noticeable differences between the Bee Bee and the Swing Around is the Swing Around features 14 cars where passengers are restrained by a lap bar which acts as a handle for passengers <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> throughout <b>the</b> duration of the ride.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{independence}} of Indonesia, Jakarta trams was still operated by the private company BVM. In the early 1950s, Jakarta tramways stretched across Jakarta from Pasar Ikan in the north to Jatinegara in the south. Trams (or Trem in Indonesian) were very popular because of its low cost. Many native passengers felt that as an independent nation, {{they are no longer}} required to pay fares, so many decided to skip paying their fares. Trams are always overflow with people so the conductors could not check the passengers on board. Many people decided <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> tram instead of getting in. Very often people go in and out through the windows instead. There was also a rise in labor unrest as increasingly confident workers sought better conditions. Greater competition from buses was also an issue. All of these caused huge impact on \BVM's finances.|$|E
25|$|On {{an unusually}} balmy day for December in Minnesota, the Vikings were able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ball {{for the final}} 5:37 of the game to {{preserve}} a 14–10 victory. After a scoreless first quarter, Minnesota quarterback Fran Tarkenton threw a 29-yard touchdown to Jim Lash. Rams kicker David Ray later added a 27-yard field goal to cut the lead to 7–3 before halftime. In the third quarter, Los Angeles advanced the ball from their own 1-yard line to the Minnesota 1-yard line. The big play on the drive was a 73-yard pass play to Harold Jackson, who was finally pushed out of bounds at the Vikings 2 by safety Jeff Wright. With the ball inside the one yard line, Rams guard Tom Mack was controversially called for illegal procedure (replays showed Mack did not move). Moved back to the six yard line, the Rams were forced to pass for a touchdown on third down but the pass was deflected and Vikings linebacker Wally Hilgenberg intercepted {{the ball in the}} end zone for a touchback. Minnesota then went on a 15-play drive that took almost eight minutes off the clock to score on Dave Osborn's 4-yard touchdown run. With 7:15 left to play in the game, the Rams then cut the deficit to 14–10 with Harold Jackson's 44-yard touchdown reception. Then after forcing the Vikings to punt, Los Angeles drove to the Minnesota 45-yard line. But a third down sack forced the Rams to punt again and the Vikings kept the ball to run out the clock.|$|E
25|$|The club's Asian success however, was not {{replicated}} {{in the beginning}} of the A-League season, with the team managing only three draws out of the first nine matches. The team's poor domestic run was put on hold while the team travelled to Morocco for the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup, where Wanderers faced Mexican side Cruz Azul in a quarter-finals clash on 13 December 2014. After going down to 9-men, Wanderers failed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> lead late into the match; an unfavourable 3–1 scoreline in extra-time saw Wanderers matched-up against ES Sétif of Algeria in a fifth place play-off. A 2–2 draw led to a penalty shoot-out which finished 5–4 in favour of the African champions, ending Wanderers' run in the tournament with the team finishing in sixth place. After returning home, the team finished the year with a loss in Wellington, in what was the team's 44th match in all competitions for the calendar year– a record for an Australian club. A short mid-season break gave Popovic the chance to organise the squad for the remainder of the season. This included the addition of Japanese internationals Yūsuke Tanaka and Yojiro Takahagi, as well as Australian-born Kerem Bulut among others as either injury replacements or squad replacements for Vitor Saba, Seyi Adeleke and foundation player Kwabena Appiah. As the season resumed, it became apparent that a heavy schedule would be the team's downfall. Wanderers had to manage entering into the 2015 AFC Champions League group-stage with the former season's rivals Guangzhou Evergrande and FC Seoul as well as rescheduled mid-week league fixtures. After a grueling three months the club ended their third season in the league in ninth position, whilst their Champions League season also ended unfavourably with the title-holders eliminated from the group stage, finishing third in their group.|$|E
50|$|Clemente {{eventually}} hit a Baltimore Chop towards {{first with}} first baseman Skowron and Coates {{trying to get}} to the ball at the same time at the cut of the infield grass. Clemente's speed forced Skowron <b>to</b> just <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ball as Coates, after trying to get the ground ball, could not make it to first base in time to cover. The high chopper allowed Virdon to score, cutting the Yankee lead to 7-6. Hal Smith followed with a three-run home run to give the Pirates a 9-7 lead. Ralph Terry relieved Coates and got the last out.|$|R
50|$|Pintle/gudgeon sets {{have many}} applications, for example: in sailing <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> rudder <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> boat; in {{transportation}} a pincer-type device clamps through a lunette {{ring on the}} tongue of a trailer; in controllable solid rocket motors a plug moves {{into and out of}} the motor throat to control thrust.|$|R

500|$|Tifa is {{featured}} in the prequel games [...] and , {{as well as the}} OVA [...] In each, her appearance relates to Nibelheim's destruction. The novella [...] "Case of Tifa", written as part of the On the Way to a Smile series, is a story set between the original game and Advent Children. Told from her point of view, the story details how she creates a new 7th Heaven bar in the city of Edge, and attempts <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> concept of a normal family with herself and Cloud, despite him beginning to isolate himself from others. Tifa also appears briefly in the game , set one year after the events of Advent Children in which she helps the protagonist Vincent Valentine defend the Planet against Omega WEAPON; she later appears in the game's epilogue, discussing Vincent's apparent disappearance.|$|E
500|$|Business {{continued}} to be successful during the late 1990s as other independent bookstores fell by the wayside and companies like Barnes & Noble expanded. Cohen and Meade decided to sell the store to Danny Gainsburg, who was selling his T-shirt business so {{he would be able}} to afford the cost of the store. The co-owners made an agreement with Gainsburg that he would gain control of the store if he was able to function amicably with the rest of the staff. Cohen and Meade set him up in a part-time position to see how he would interact with the employees and sold him an equity stake in the business without informing the other staff members. Gainsburg was pressured to leave by the staff after he kissed an employee on her birthday. The three co-owners agreed that Gainsburg should resign, and Gainsburg received back his initial investment plus a premium. Gainsburg said to the Wall Street Journal, [...] "We all started with good motives, but there was lots of naiveté on all sides." [...] In 2006, a year after the botched sale attempt, Cohen and Meade both decided <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> store as sole co-owners for at least three to five more years and met with an outside consultant to devise an eventual exit strategy.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the digital effects, the series also features stuntwork. Lou Bollo took over as stunt coordinator after the pilot episode, and big scenes often involved the actors, though stunt doubles were used for certain moments. For the final lake scene in [...] "Dead in the Water", in which Dean must save a boy after he is pulled underwater by a vengeful spirit, Jensen Ackles had <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> young actor as they were pulled down ten feet into the water by divers. The actor portraying the vengeful spirit had to wear a wetsuit under his costume due to the {{extended period of time}} he was required to spend in the lake. Ackles and Jared Padalecki performed most of the fight scene featured in [...] "Skin", and only took four hours to learn the fight choreography. However, stunt doubles were brought in for the scenes in which they are thrown into bookshelves and through a coffee table. For the episode [...] "Shadow", rather than filming at the exterior location for the scene of Meg Masters being thrown out of a window to the street below, it was decided to not depict the impact, instead having the Winchesters look down at her body after the landing. Thus, filming of it was allowed to take place in the studio using a body double.|$|E

50|$|Both {{materials}} come in reels {{of material}} ranging from 13mm to 180 mm wide {{and up to}} 100 m long. Around 40-80 cm of wick is wrapped onto each torch. In general, {{it is best to}} use hard limiting devices, such as nuts and bolts, <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> wick <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> shaft of the torch.|$|R
50|$|However, the {{potential}} advantage of such fouling {{is that it}} stops the game clock. If a team is trailing with time running out in the game, the strategy may be their only hope, as they cannot afford to allow time to elapse from the game clock while playing a standard defense, especially with the winning team looking <b>to</b> simply <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ball until time runs out without even attempting to score, if possible. Instead, they must foul {{as a means of}} terminating the opposing team's possession as soon as possible. Also, the effectiveness of this strategy is heightened as fatigue and pressure can affect the ability of the free-throw shooter.|$|R
