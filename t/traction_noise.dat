40|$|<b>Traction</b> <b>noise</b> {{is one of}} {{the noise}} sources of powered railway {{vehicles}} such as locomotives, electric and diesel powered train units and high speed trains. Especially at speeds below 60 km/h and at idling, but also at acceleration conditions {{for a wide range of}} speeds, <b>traction</b> <b>noise</b> can be dominant. This is relevant for noise in residential areas near stations and shunting yards, but in some cases also along the line. The other relevant sources are rolling noise, often dominant between 100 and 250 km/h, aerodynamic noise, which can be dominant above 300 km/h, braking noise, curve squeal and impact noise. The braking system can often technically be considered part of the overall traction system, although acoustically it will often have separate noise sources. In the Harmonoise and IMAGINE projects, a generalised prediction model for railway <b>traction</b> <b>noise</b> has been proposed to cover a broad range of powered railway vehicles. The model {{is one of the}} prediction modules for overall rail traffic noise, which also covers the other main sources. The <b>traction</b> <b>noise</b> model includes the main operational parameters such as driveshaft speed and power settings, and also takes individual auxiliary components and their duty cycles into account, such as compressors, valves and fans. Source height is included in the model. The level of modelling detail in the many potential <b>traction</b> <b>noise</b> sources has been kept to a minimum, as for the purpose of rail traffic noise prediction it often suffices to model only the dominant sources. Measurement methods are outlined to determine the noise emission spectra from which extrapolations are made to obtain estimates for different operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|In the Harmonoise {{project the}} {{description}} of vertical and horizontal directivities of railway noise sources has been required. Other features of the source description are sound power level spectra in third octave bands {{as a function of}} speed and the physical location of the different sound sources. Based on systematic investigations methods to measure and to determine the directivities of railway noise sources are presented in this paper. The determination of the directivity of rolling noise is discussed in detail. For the directivities of <b>traction</b> <b>noise</b> and aerodynamic noise the discussion is more analytical because of limited access to relevant data. For each type of main railway noise source, i. e. rolling noise, <b>traction</b> <b>noise</b> and aerodynamic noise, default directivity functions are proposed for the use in the source description of railway noise. These default directivity functions will be subject to revisions when more accurate data become available...|$|E

The approach followed can be distinguished in two different moments: on board measurements and pass by measurements.

50|$|Mountain {{bike and}} some {{motorcycle}} tires feature tread similar to off-road tires used on {{cars and trucks}} but may sometimes include an unbroken tread that runs along its center. This feature provides better <b>traction</b> and lower <b>noise</b> on asphalt at high tire pressure, but retains the ability to provide grip on a soft or loose surface- lower tire pressure or soft ground will cause the side lugs to {{come into contact with}} the surface. Road street bike tires, have smaller grooves in the tread allowing water to escape from beneath the tire.|$|R

40|$|The Tyre {{tread pattern}} is the {{arrangement}} of blocks, grooves and voids, sipes and channels designed into the tread to enhance its grip on the road. Tread is the uppermost part of any tyre which contact into the road and {{it has its own}} performance towards mileage, <b>traction,</b> low <b>noise</b> and heat built up properties. It would be meaningful to conduct an extended analysis on the tyre tread blocks for its performance in static and dynamic condition to predict its behavior and wear of tread block in on-road condition. The Finite Element software Abaqus is used for the present analysis of the tread block and its behavior was studied on two different contact surfaces. The tread block is modeled in six different shapes and analyzed for is performance. The deformation stress strain characteristic of different blocks is studied which will be useful in deciding the contact behavior, friction and road grip. The regular shape/geometry has common behavior and the mixed type geometry shows a distinguished variation in the analysis. The dynamic stiffness and deformed shape was analyzed in this study and it has its own effect in tyre design. The tread block dynamics study by geometric shape would be vital in tread pattern optimization to enhance the traction, better hydroplaning and rolling resistance under all operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|The IMAGINE {{railway traffic}} noise source model is described, {{which is a}} further {{elaboration}} and completion of the Harmonoise model. Within the EU project Harmonoise, a model was proposed including most of the main railway noise sources. In the IMAGINE project, complete formulation was put forward taking all relevant physical sources but also main operating conditions into account, and default source data was proposed. At a given section of track with a given traffic flow, {{for each type of}} rolling stock, a combination of operating conditions and physical sources may occur. The operating conditions are constant speed, acceleration, braking, curving and stationary operation. The physical sources are rolling noise, impact noise, <b>traction</b> <b>noise,</b> curve squeal in points or curves, broadband or tonal braking noise and aerodynamic noise. The IMAGINE models for each physical source are presented and their relevance for each operating condition is discussed. Some examples of default input data are given and measurement methods to obtain source data are outlined...|$|E
40|$|The European HARMONOISE {{project has}} {{provided}} a best-in-existence engineering model for the propagation of road and rail traffic noise. Its successor project IMAGINE is aiming at developing new methods also for industrial noise and aircraft noise, standardizing the HARMONOISE methods, and providing guidelines {{on how to use}} these methods for noise mapping. A measurement campaign has been carried out in Sweden to collect the necessary input parameters data for determining railway rolling noise emission complying with the HARMONOISE-IMAGINE source model. In this paper the HARMONOISE-IMAGINE source model for railway noise will briefly be described and the practical methods to determine the model-input parameters will be presented. For the time being only the model parameters for rolling noise have been handled, because it is the most important noise source. <b>Traction</b> <b>noise</b> will be important at low speeds and around stations and switchyards. Aerodynamic noise will become a concern when high speed trains will have been introduced in Sweden in future. The HARMONOISE-IMAGINE model has provided the guidelines for handling these noise sources...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the directivity of railway noise. The directivity of railway noise is of particular importance when we have high-rise buildings close to the track, tunnel openings, partial barriers, or when we calculate the maximum sound pressure level during a pass-by based on the sound power level of the different sub-sources of a train. On the other hand, directivity {{is a part of}} source description. The directivity of the different sub-sources of a train has been studied systematically by carrying out new measurements, collecting relevant information from the literature and modelling the physical processes. The focus has been on railway rolling noise from wheels and track but both railway <b>traction</b> <b>noise</b> and aerodynamic noise are also dealt with. First the individual sub-sources are studied and then the sound pressure level contributions from each of these sources are combined to yield the directivity of a whole train. In general, the directivity of a whole train is both distance and speed dependent. Moreover, high speed source motion can affect the directivity dramatically. All these results are summarized into equations practical to use for engineering applications...|$|E
5000|$|The Type 2, {{along with}} the 1947 Citroën H Van, are among the first 'forward control' vans in which the driver was placed above the front roadwheels. They started a trend in Europe, where the 1952 GM Bedford CA, 1958 RAF-977, 1959 Renault Estafette, 1960 BMC Morris J4, and 1960 Commer FC also used the concept. In the United States, the Corvair-based Chevrolet Corvan cargo van and Greenbrier {{passenger}} van {{went so far as}} to copy the Type 2's rear-engine layout, using the Corvair's horizontally opposed, air-cooled engine for power. Except for the Greenbrier and various 1950s-70s Fiat minivans, the Type 2 remained unique in being rear-engined. This was a disadvantage for the early [...] "barndoor" [...] Panel Vans, which could not easily be loaded from the rear because the engine cover intruded on interior space, but generally advantageous in <b>traction</b> and interior <b>noise.</b>|$|R
40|$|Road vehicle tyres, railway {{wheels and}} ball {{bearings}} all generate rolling contact forces which are transferred within a finite {{area of contact}} between the rolling element and the substrate. Either it is visible or not for the human eye, {{a certain degree of}} roughness is always present on the contacting surfaces and it influences the generation of both vertical and lateral contactforces. The purpose of this investigation is to enhance the understanding and modelling of the influence from small-scale surface roughness on the generation of rolling contact forces. To this end, a computationally efficient method to include roughness-induced contact nonlinearities in the dynamic modelling of rolling contacts is proposed. The method is implemented in a time domain model for vertical wheel–track interaction to model rolling-induced rail vibrations, showing good agreement with measurements. Furthermore, a test rig is developed and used for the investigation of tyre–road rolling contact forces. Detailed studies are performed on the influence of substrate roughness on the resulting contact forces for a tyre tread block which is rolling at different operating conditions. The choice of substrate as well as the rolling velocity and the slip ratio is observed to have significant influence on the resulting friction coefficient. For high slip ratios, stick–slip oscillations appear, exhibiting frequency content which is largely dependent on the choice of substrate. The outcomes of this study can potentially be used to improve future tyre–road contacts with respect to wear, <b>traction</b> and <b>noise</b> generation.

40|$|Methods {{summarized}} {{by the term}} Traction Force Microscopy are widely used to quantify cellular forces in mechanobiological studies. These methods are inverse, {{in the sense that}} forces must be determined such that they comply with a measured displacement field. This study investigates how several experimental and analytical factors, originating in the realization of the experiments and the procedures for the analysis, affect the determined traction forces. The present results demonstrate that even for very high resolution measurements free of <b>noise,</b> <b>traction</b> forces can be significantly underestimated, while traction peaks are typically overestimated by 50 % or more, even in the noise free case. Compared to this errors, which are inherent {{to the nature of the}} mechanical problem and its discretization, the effect of ignoring the out-of-plane displacement component, the interpolation scheme used between the discrete measurement points and the disregard of the geometrical non-linearities when using a nearly linear substrate material are less consequential. Nevertheless, a nonlinear elastic substrate, with strain-stiffening response and some degree of compressibility, can substantially improve the robustness of the reconstruction of traction forces over a wide range of magnitudes. This poses the need for a correct mechanical representation of these non-linearities during the traction reconstruction and a correct mechanical characterization of the substrate itself, especially for the large strain shear domain which is shown to plays a major role in the deformations induced by cells...|$|R
40|$|The European noise {{directive}} {{has been}} ratified. Noise maps and action plans must be made. In {{the short term}} the use of defined interim calculation methods must be used. On the longer term a harmonized calculation method is needed. The project Harmonoise has the objective to develop a European prediction model {{which can be used}} all over Europe. The Harmonoise engineering method is developed for computation of the noise indicators Lden and Lnight. Since sound propagation effects can strongly depend on meteorological conditions, the method must be able to handle different meteorological conditions that occur during a year in different directions of propagation. In order to obtain a more physical description of the sources, a subdivision into sub sources at different heights is necessary, distinguishing different physical mechanisms: rolling noise, <b>traction</b> <b>noise</b> and (for high speed trains) aerodynamic noise. The method is flexible {{in such a way that}} it can be used both for detailed computations in case of noise assessment and for noise mapping requiring a higher speed of computations. This computation time is saved by a reduction of input data, using the same calculation engine...|$|E
40|$|A {{dominating}} {{source for}} the radiated acoustic noise from a train at low speeds is the <b>traction</b> motor. This <b>noise</b> originates from electromagnetic forces acting on the structure resulting in vibrations {{on the surface and}} thus radiated noise. It is often perceived as annoying due to its tonal nature. To achieve a desirable acoustic behavior, and also to meet legal requirements, it is of great importance to thoroughly understand the generation of noise of electromagnetic origin in the motor and also to be able to control it to a low level. In this work, experimental tests have been performed on a traction motor operated from pulse width modulated (PWM) converter. A PWM converter outputs a quasi-sinusoidal voltage created from switched voltage pulses of different widths. The resulting main vibrations at PWM operation and their causes have been analyzed. It is concluded that an appropriate selection of the PWM switching frequency, that is {{the rate at which the}} voltage is switched, is a powerful tool to influence the noise of electromagnetic origin. Changing the switching frequency shifts the frequencies of the exciting electromagnetic forces. Further experimental investigations show that the trend is that the resulting sound power level decreases with increasing switching frequency and eventually the sound power level reaches an almost constant level. The underlying physical phenomena for the reduced sound power level is different for different frequency ranges. It is proposed that the traction motor, similar to a thin walled cylindrical structure, shows a constant vibration over force response above a certain frequency. This is investigated using numerical simulations of simplified models. Above this certain frequency, where the area of high modal density is dominating, the noise reducing effect of further increasing the switching frequency is limited. QC 20180109 </p...|$|R
