5|$|In 2006 {{the pier}} {{was sold to}} Manchester company Urban Splash. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> {{launched}} a competition in August 2007, inviting people to submit ideas for the regeneration of the pier and island. At the time, the repair work required was estimated at £4 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{wealth of}} <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> meant {{that in the}} summer of 2009, the club was able to finance the {{purchase}} of several experienced international players prior to the new season, spending more than any other club in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Although the Act of 1975 had {{specified}} that {{a portion of}} the profits from land sales be used to maintain the remaining cemetery, little restoration work was done and the cemetery continued to revert to wilderness. With <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> of the land interested only in redeveloping those parts of the cemetery not currently in use, the cemetery itself sank further into neglect.|$|E
2500|$|On February 6, 1898, it was {{reported}} that a Canadian shipbuilder, W.J. Stephens, while in Portland, had, on behalf of Victoria, BC interests, purchased Elwood from the Lewis River Transportation Company [...] <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> {{was reported}} in one source to be the Lake Bennett & Klondike Navigation Company.

40|$|Property sales involve {{two main}} {{contract}} partners, <b>the</b> buyer (<b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner)</b> and <b>the</b> seller (the property owner). In {{some cases the}} property owner can have let a third person (the leaseholder) lease the property or the land. The rights and obligations that fall on the property owner, the leaseholder and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> according to <b>the</b> Code of land laws can appear difficult and unclear, especially con-cerning reservation, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner’s</b> duty to inspect the property {{and when he does}} not act in good faith, the formal requirement and when terms are changed. The work towards a more uniform interpretation of the Code of land laws should result in a greater correspondence between the rules of leasehold and property sales, the rules of leasehold should be interpreted in accordance with the rules of property sales. This should mean an increased responsibility for the property owner to reserve the lease and a de-creased duty for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> to inspect <b>the</b> property. If the lease is only partially re-served, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> is only bound by the leasehold to the parts which he understood from the reservation and the duty to inspect the property is limited to documents in the property owner’s possession. There are no criteria for when <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> is considered not being in good faith, but it should be all kinds of visible signs. Despite the formal requirements, oral agreements can bind <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> to <b>the</b> leasehold, even though the possibilities for this are small. A complete disapproval of oral agreement would not constitute a good development of the Code of land laws...|$|R
5|$|Documentation of records, {{including}} the members' deliberations, {{are kept in}} the committee’s archives, which are deposited with the British Trust for Ornithology. Some older data is missing, as the committee's files were originally held by the editors of British Birds, {{and they were not}} transferred to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> of the magazine when it was sold in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 the {{holdings}} of the St Anne's Land & Building Company (including the pier) were {{bought by the}} Amalgamated Investment Company, based in London. Some alterations to the pier were made by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners,</b> including the addition of an aviary and a reptile house. The Floral Hall was refurbished {{and turned into a}} Tyrolean-style beer garden.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 First Roumanian-American {{was one of}} the few congregations on the Lower East Side {{to still}} have its own Talmud Torah. This school had been housed in a small {{building}} on the east side of the synagogue that had formerly served as the church rectory. The congregation was eventually forced to sell the building, but <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> retained the school's carved sign.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, GameSpy, {{the company}} {{providing}} multiplayer {{support for the}} game, was purchased by Glu Mobile. After the purchase, Glu Mobile raised the fees being charged to publishers to provide online services for their games. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> then shut down {{a number of the}} online services for different games, including Neverwinter Nights 2. GameSpy claimed that the developers had allowed their contracts to lapse, and, after providing free services for a time, were no longer willing to continue.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} {{subsequently}} closed as a hostel {{by the council}} and sold for £1.295m to Westcombe Estates. Planning permission was granted to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> in January 2007 for {{the conversion of the}} building into a luxury housing block of 12 units and expanded for a further three years in February 2010.|$|E
5|$|The new manor, {{known as}} the Garrett, was owned by John Tyldesley in 1505. The timber-framed Garrett Hall {{remained}} with the Tyldesleys until 1652 when Lambert Tyldesley died leaving no heir. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners,</b> the Stanleys, leased it to tenant farmers. In 1732 it was sold to Thomas Clowes who also leased the property to tenants. In 1829 the estate was bought by the Bridgewater Trustees.|$|E

50|$|The {{impact of}} huur gaat voor koop in modern South African law is that <b>the</b> {{purchaser}} (<b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner)</b> is substituted ex lege {{for the original}} lessor, and the latter falls out of the picture. On being so substituted, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> acquires, by operation of law, all {{the rights of the}} original lessor under the lease.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> {{decided not}} merely to give the vessel a total refit. The keel, badly damaged during the grounding, was {{completely}} renewed along a length of , and the owners {{took the opportunity to}} further strengthen the hull. The old keelsons were replaced and ten new ones laid, which ran {{the entire length of the}} keel. Both the bow and stern were also strengthened by heavy frames of double angle iron.|$|E
5|$|There were {{setbacks}} with distribution, however. United Artists, {{which had}} {{ownership of the}} movie, changed hands and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> {{had no interest in}} the movie. Carradine bought the movie back from U.A., and set out to find a distributor. The picture was picked up by Crown International, which specialized in teen exploitation films. Just two weeks before the opening was scheduled, Carradine was still shooting some additional scenes.|$|E
5|$|A short interregnum followed, {{during which}} {{ownership}} {{was transferred to}} J.W. Skaggs. Skaggs continued to push Alexander's Democratic Party/states' rights agenda during his short five weeks at the helm. The poor economics of the weekly paper were unchanged, however, and Skaggs immediately moved to unload his newly acquired white elephant. He cut his losses and avoided the stigma of financial failure for himself and the conservative political movement by giving away the paper outright to two men who worked for him as printers, William Thompson and William Victor. According to Thompson's later recollection, Skaggs sweetened the transfer of ownership by tossing in two bundles of paper and two cords of firewood for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> of Chronos after Derek sells it. She {{likes to}} gossip.|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason a}} <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> {{might want to}} cancel, is perhaps the buyer has made a large {{financial}} commitment in {{the excitement of the}} sales presentation, and now at home, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> has buyers remorse. Or, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> may not know exactly what was purchased and how that timeshare actually works, or didn't realize at the time of purchase that ownership maintenance fees are a lifelong commitment. Or, perhaps <b>the</b> <b>new</b> timeshare <b>owner</b> feels they haven't had the time to research the company the timeshare was just bought from, because it was purchased during the first visit to the timeshare resort.|$|R

5|$|In 1983, {{the station}} was finally closed when Conrail and the newly formed Metro-North Railroad {{announced}} that the new stations along the Erie's former high speed freight line, the Graham Line, would take over freight and passenger service. Trains to Harriman would stop at a new park-and-ride built to the south. The former 1911 station depot, however, remained standing until 2006, when the Harriman village building inspector forced <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> of the right-of-way for the old main line, Norfolk Southern, to either revamp or demolish the former station depot. The railway chose the latter, and in May 2006, a excavator tore down the 1911 depot, with the remains taken to a dump in nearby Hillburn.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, a troika {{of private}} equity firms led by TPG Capital, L.P with {{associates}} Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners agreed to purchase BK from Diageo for , with the sale becoming complete in December of that year. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners,</b> through several new CEOs, moved to revitalize and reorganize the company, {{the first major}} move was to rename the BK parent as Burger King Brands. The investment group initially planned to take BK public within the {{two years of the}} acquisition, this was delayed until 2006. On 1 February 2006, Out-going CEO Greg Brenneman announced TPG's plans to turn Burger King into a publicly traded company by issuing an Initial Public Offering (IPO).|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Jack's (Sean Hayes) {{talk show}} Jack Talk is {{completely}} revamped, after right-wing conservatives {{take over the}} gay network, OutTV. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> hire the ultra-conservative Amber-Louise (Spears) as Jack Talks new co-host, infuriating Jack. While Jack is deciding {{whether or not he}} will stand up to his new bosses, Karen (Megan Mullally) desires a baby of her own.

5|$|Ocean Village Marina was {{formerly}} Sheppard's Marina, owned by H. Sheppard & Co. By 2004, the marina {{had been sold}} to Ocean Village Investments Ltd and demolition had commenced. The marina retained its original name, at least informally, for several years after the sale. The sale of Sheppard's Marina was not without controversy, as some residents of the marina were eventually evicted from their berths by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners.</b> After Ocean Village Investments acquired the adjacent Marina Bay in 2006, both marinas were incorporated into Ocean Village, a resort with residential, retail, and leisure facilities.|$|E

5|$|On 3 May 2012, {{the club}} {{was taken over by}} DFC 1883 Ltd with the {{intention}} of moving into community ownership. Because it failed to agree a creditors voluntary agreement (CVA), and proposed to play at a ground without the required grading for the Northern Premier League, Darlington were relegated four divisions, to the Northern League Division One, on the recommendation of the Football Association.
