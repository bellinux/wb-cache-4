5|$|Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne <b>tropical</b> <b>disease</b> {{caused by}} the dengue virus. Symptoms {{typically}} begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In {{a small proportion of}} cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.|$|E
5|$|Dengue {{has become}} a global problem since the Second World War and is common in more than 110countries. Each year between 50 and 528million people are {{infected}} and approximately 10,000 to 20,000 die. The earliest descriptions of an outbreak date from 1779. Its viral cause and spread were understood by the early 20th century. Apart from eliminating the mosquitoes, work is ongoing for medication targeted directly at the virus. It is classified as a neglected <b>tropical</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 6.6 million people, mostly in Mexico, Central America and South America, have Chagas disease as of 2015. In 2015, Chagas was estimated to result in 8,000 deaths. Most people with the disease are poor, and most do not realize they are infected. Large-scale population movements have increased the areas where Chagas disease is found and these include many European countries and the United States. These areas have also seen {{an increase in the}} years up to 2014. The disease was first described in 1909 by the Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, after whom it is named. Chagas disease is classified as a neglected <b>tropical</b> <b>disease.</b> It affects more than 150 other animals.|$|E

5|$|<b>Tropical</b> <b>disease</b> {{killed or}} {{rendered}} ineffective far more 2RR men than the Germans did; {{at times the}} regiment was reduced to an effective strength of under 100 by the vast myriad of potential ailments, including trench fever, blackwater fever, dysentery, pneumonia, sleeping sickness and many others. The 1,038 personnel who served with 2RR in East Africa collectively went into hospital 2,272 times, and there were 10,626 incidences of illness—in other words, the average 2RR soldier was hospitalised twice and reported sick 10 times. In January 1917, only 91 of the regiment's men were considered fit for duty; {{it was no longer}} an effective fighting force, and the white Southern Rhodesian manpower did not exist to continue reinforcing it. It was therefore withdrawn from East Africa that month. Those men who were healthy enough to return home arrived back in Salisbury on 14 April 1917, receiving a tumultuous welcome, but the majority of 2RR remained in medical care overseas for some time afterwards.|$|E
5|$|One of five {{children}} of Irish-Swedish descent, Lindwall had a difficult childhood during the Great Depression, with both parents dying before he finished high school. Lindwall was inspired in his childhood after watching England's Harold Larwood, the fastest bowler of the era, terrorise the Australian batsmen during the notorious Bodyline series of 1932–33 with short-pitched intimidatory bowling. During his teenage years, Lindwall rose {{through the ranks of}} Sydney Grade Cricket at St. George under the tutelage of Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, who was regarded as the finest bowler in the world at the time. Lindwall made his first-class debut for New South Wales in 1941–42. At the same time, Lindwall, a fine athlete, was playing for St. George in the first-grade of the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership as a full back. With the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, interstate cricket was cancelled and in 1943, Lindwall joined the army and served in New Guinea until 1945. Lindwall returned to Australia still suffering from the after-effects of <b>tropical</b> <b>disease,</b> but he quickly made an impact upon the resumption of first-class cricket. He did well enough to gain selection a tour of New Zealand, where he made his Test debut in March 1946 in a match that was retrospectively accredited. Lindwall returned to Australia and spent the winter playing football for St. George, helping his team to the grand final of the 1946 NSWRFL season, after which he retired to concentrate solely on cricket.|$|E

25|$|Schistosomiasis {{affected}} about 252 {{million people}} worldwide in 2015. An estimated 4,400 to 200,000 people die from it each year. The disease is most {{commonly found in}} Africa, as well as Asia and South America. Around 700 million people, in more than 70 countries, live {{in areas where the}} disease is common. In tropical countries, schistosomiasis is second only to malaria among parasitic diseases with the greatest economic impact. Schistosomiasis is listed as a neglected <b>tropical</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
25|$|About 4 to 12 {{million people}} are {{currently}} infected in some 98 countries. About 2 million new cases and between 20 and 50 thousand deaths occur each year.

25|$|Whipworm (Trichuris trichiura) is {{the third}} most common STH-causing {{nematode}} in humans. According to current estimate, nearly 800 million people are infected, and majority of the victims are children. Heavy infections could lead to acute symptoms such as diarrhoea and anaemia, and chronic symptoms such as growth retardation and impaired cognitive development. Medical conditions are more often serious since coinfection with protozoan parasites such as Giardia and Entamoeba histolytica, and with other nematodes is common. Predominantly a <b>tropical</b> <b>disease</b> of developing countries, trichuriasis is quite common in the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{most serious}} impact was, perhaps not surprisingly, {{on the state}} of public health in the territory. The large numbers of water {{containers}} standing open across Gibraltar provided an ideal breeding habitat for mosquitoes. Ships carrying cargoes from Africa brought with them the <b>tropical</b> <b>disease</b> yellow fever, which is spread by female mosquitoes carrying the infection. From 1804, Gibraltar suffered five outbreaks of yellow fever; in the first and most devastating, the death toll amounted to 5,733 people {{out of a total of}} around 18,000, representing 32 per cent of the population.|$|E

25|$|The disease occurs {{regularly}} {{in some regions}} of sub-Saharan Africa with the population at risk being about 70 million in 36 countries. An estimated 11,000 people are currently infected with 2,800 new infections in 2015. In 2015 it caused around 3,500 deaths, down from 34,000 in 1990. More than 80% of these cases are in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Three major outbreaks have occurred in recent history: one from 1896 to 1906 primarily in Uganda and the Congo Basin and two in 1920 and 1970 in several African countries.

40|$|The paper {{summarizes}} recent {{findings on}} the epidemiology and pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/Aids), highlighting the role of co-infections with major <b>tropical</b> <b>diseases.</b> Such co-infections have been studied in the Brazilian context {{since the beginning of}} the Aids epidemic and are expected to be more frequent and relevant as the Aids epidemic in Brazil proceeds towards smaller municipalities and the countryside, where <b>tropical</b> <b>diseases</b> are endemic. Unlike opportunistic diseases that affect basically the immunocompromised host, most <b>tropical</b> <b>diseases,</b> as well as tuberculosis, are pathogenic on their own, and can affect subjects with mild or no immunossuppression. In the era of highly active anti-retroviral therapies (HAART), opportunistic diseases seem to be on decrease in Brazil, where such medicines are fully available. Benefiting from HAART in terms of restoration of the immune function, putative milder clinical courses are expected in the future for most co-infections, including <b>tropical</b> <b>diseases.</b> On the other hand, from an ecological perspective, the progressive geographic diffusion of Aids makes <b>tropical</b> <b>diseases</b> and tuberculosis a renewed challenge for Brazilian researchers and practitioners dealing with HIV/Aids in the coming years...|$|R
