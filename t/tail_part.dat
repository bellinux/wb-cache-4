The method mixes different copulas with distorted margins to construct new copula functions, and it enables us to model the dependence structure of risks by handling the central and <b>tail</b> <b>parts</b> separately. By applying the method we can modify the tail dependence of a given copula to any desired level measured by tail dependence function and tail dependence coefficients of marginal distributions. As an application, a tight bound for asymptotic Value-at-Risk of order statistics is obtained by using the method.

During this season Paige meets Sam Wilder (her birth-father)and slowly comes to terms with letting him into her life. Paige shows signs of still struggling with living up to the legend of her deceased sister Prue and her title of [...] "Superwitch". When Paige masters a difficult spell created by Prue, she appears to come at peace with her sibling rivalry. Later in the season, Paige, alongside Phoebe, trains to be a mid-wife in order to deliver Piper's baby. When Piper gives birth to a boy she names Wyatt, he is given the middle name Matthew in honor of his protective aunt Paige. In the sixth season (2003-2004), Paige grows tired of unemployment and obtains a job at a temp agency. While employed on the various jobs via the agency, Paige finds herself drawn into various magical endeavors concerning members of the magical community. Through one of these magical journeys she meets and later dates a witch named Richard Montana (Balthazar Getty), [...] a relationship which mirrors the love affair Phoebe had with Cole as Richard attempts to avoid the temptations of dark magic. The couple eventually break up, but not before Paige binds Richard's powers so that he doesn't feel the temptation to misuse his powers. Also in this season, Paige becomes the second person to discover that the sisters' new time-traveling Whitelighter Chris Perry (Drew Fuller) is actually Chris Halliwell and the second child of Piper and Leo. He has come back in time to prevent Wyatt from becoming evil in the future. Together, Chris helps Paige and her sisters discover that a powerful Elder named Gideon (Gildart Jackson) wishes to destroy the Twice-Blessed Wyatt, an act which causes Wyatt to turn his back on good in the future.|$|E

In 2002, the team picked up funding from Miccosukee and switched to the No. 09. Driver Geoffrey Bodine had a third-place finish in the Daytona 500, and later had a 2nd-place qualification at the Pepsi 400. Mike Wallace ran a limited schedule for Phoenix in 2003, and had two top-ten finishes. Scott Pruett and Buckshot Jones also ran one race deals for the team that season, during which they switched to Dodge. The team began 2004 with Joe Ruttman and Johnny Benson sharing the ride. The idea was that Benson, who was also driving the team's Busch Series car, would run full races and Ruttman would start and park when he started. This drew criticism in the Subway 400, the second race of the season, at Rockingham when Ruttman entered with no pit crew, was parked by NASCAR after one lap, and collected $54,196 for a last-place finish.

40|$|The {{operation}} mode of continuous casting machines {{has a great}} influence on internal and surface defects of cast ingots. When a solidifying ingot passes along the process line of the continuous casting machine stress and deformations arise in its solidifying skin, it leading to cracks formation and determining the quality of production. The contemporary investigations are devoted mainly to the existing {{operation mode}}s of continuous casting, in which the field of temperature distribution in ingot is stationary in the system of coordinates, linked with the crystallizer. Little attention {{has so far been}} paid to transition periods, due to difficulties of investigation and description of the processes happening during these periods. During the period of completion of continuous casting the rate of ingot’s drawing is reduced to the minimal possible value, thus ensuring trouble-free operation of continuous casting machines, the <b>tail</b> <b>part</b> of slabs being cooled down in a greater degree than the bulk of slabs.
