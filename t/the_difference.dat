5|$|Burst {{frequency}} offset (BFO) – <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> between the expected and received frequency of transmissions. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> {{is caused by}} doppler shift as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU that results from drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the uplink. This measure can be analysed to determine where along the BTO rings the aircraft was located.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>difference</b> in {{the hearing}} ranges for octopus and bigfin reef squids may be {{explained}} by <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in their habitats. The octopus is demersal (bottom-dwelling) with excellent camouflage capabilities. Bigfin reef squids, on the other hand, are usually in open water with limited hiding places. Hearing would thus be more important for the squids to escape predators. The ability to hear is particularly relevant for avoiding mammalian predators of the suborder Odontoceti (particularly dolphins), who use echolocation to find prey.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:In {{comparison}} with the ITRF 2000 model, the ITRF 2005 model represents a significant improvement in solution generation, datum definition and realization. However, these improvements cause a frame <b>difference</b> between <b>the</b> ITRF 2000 and ITRF 2005 models, which may impact GNSS data processing. To quantify this impact, <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> of <b>the</b> GNSS results obtained using the two models, including station coordinates, baseline length and horizontal velocity field, were analyzed. After transformation, <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> in position were at the millimeter level, and <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> in baseline length were less than 1 mm. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> in <b>the</b> horizontal velocity fields decreased with as the study area was reduced.

5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw to make up <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth {{at the tip of the}} snout. However, <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E
