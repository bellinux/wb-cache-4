Needless to say, {{the very idea of}} classification is premised on, and engenders, inequality. <b>Therein</b> <b>lies</b> the paradox of equality jurisprudence. The necessity of differentiation is even more paramount in modern society with its increasingly complicated problems. Joseph Tussman and Jacobus tenBroek have proposed the doctrine of reasonable classification as the solution, whereby the legislation defines the class that includes all who are similarly situated for the purpose of the law and none who are not.|$|E

40|$|Mechanics texts {{tell us that}} a {{particle}} in a bound orbit under gravitational central force moves on an ellipse, while introductory physics texts approximate the earth as flat, and {{tell us that the}} particle moves in a parabola. The uniform-gravity, flat-earth parabola is clearly meant to be an approximation to a small segment of the true central-force/ellipse orbit. To look more deeply into this connection we convert earth-centered polar coordinates to ``flat-earth coordinates'' by treating radial lines as vertical, and by treating lines of constant radial distance as horizontal. With the exact trajectory and dynamics in this system, we consider such questions as whether gravity is purely vertical in this picture, and whether the central force nature of gravity is important only when the height or range of a ballistic trajectory is comparable to the earth radius. Somewhat surprisingly, the answers to both questions is ``no,'' and <b>therein</b> <b>lie</b> some interesting lessons. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical advance by which factored POSGs can be decomposed into local models. We formal-ize {{the interface between}} such local models as the influ-ence agents can exert on one another; and we prove that this interface is sufficient for decoupling them. The result-ing influence-based abstraction substantially generalizes pre-vious work on exploiting weakly-coupled agent interaction structures. <b>Therein</b> <b>lie</b> several important contributions. First, our general formulation sheds {{new light on the}} theoretical re-lationships among previous approaches, and promotes future empirical comparisons that could come by extending them beyond the more specific problem contexts for which they were developed. More importantly, the influence-based ap-proaches that we generalize have shown promising improve-ments in the scalability of planning for more restrictive mod-els. Thus, our theoretical result here serves as the foundation for practical algorithms that we anticipate will bring similar improvements to more general planning contexts, and also into other domains such as approximate planning, decision-making in adversarial domains, and online learning. ...|$|R

While originally believing the medium of wire sculpture to be merely clever and amusing, as his work developed, he began to state that wire sculpture had an important place {{in the history of}} art and remarked on the great possibilities that lie within the medium.“These new studies in wire, however, did not remain the simple modest little things I had done in New York.

The wire sculpture accomplishes this in a most decided manner.” ...|$|R

The forces that act upon a ball pitched by Getzein are not different from those which operate upon a projectile thrown from any other source, and the results must be the same, and governed by the same laws. The curves are in the imagination of Getzein's admirers. When the ball leaves his hand it is beyond his control, and it moves forward from the impulse last given it as it leaves his hand. It is then controlled by the force of propulsion, the resistance of the atmosphere, and gravitation[...] [...] [...] Getzein's antic and deceptive motions may deceive the batter, so that he is unable to discover the exact course of the ball in time to strike it, but he cannot throw a ball so as to make a curve on the horizontal plane." ...|$|E
40|$|The author {{considers}} how ethical food raises complex {{challenges for}} policy makers. Looking mainly at Europe and developed countries, {{it is suggested}} that the notion of ethical food is plastic, but that <b>therein</b> <b>lie</b> its strength and appeal. Civil society movements see it as a rallying point to restructure food systems, from land use to consumption. The mainstream corporate sector sees ethical food as an umbrella term under which many, sometimes even competing, aspirations nestle, but which can be incorporated as additional niche markets. Far from being new, the ethical-food banner in the late 20 th century has resurrected some older traditions, including those which contested power relations in the food system. But in the 21 st century, with the world’s food system under economic, environmental, social, and political stress, the ethical-food umbrella faces an uncertain future. It could be submerged by ‘value-for-money’ consumerism; or it could become a champion of what the author calls an emerging set of ‘omnistandards’, under which fragmented single issues coalesce and articulate a new paradigm. ...|$|R
