5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got her hand <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> in the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of}} a day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.|$|E

500|$|The {{conflict}} between the commanders reached its nadir during the invasion of Tarakan in May 1945, when Jones grounded RAAF bomber squadrons scheduled {{to take part in}} the attack due to their crews having exceeded their monthly quota of flying hours. Bostock was not consulted about the decision and fully expected to see Australian aircraft as he watched for the Allied formations from a US warship during the battle. He later said that he would have thankfully [...] "fallen <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> in the boards on the deck" [...] when he saw only American aircraft flying overhead, and had to apologise to Kenney for the RAAF's absence. Over all, the dual system of control and the tension between its two senior officers confused the RAAF's efforts in the field and reduced its influence on Allied strategy in the Pacific.|$|E

[...] Carpenter and Technicolor also devised a lookup table (LUT) to darken the color palette. Carpenter said, [...] "For a lot of recent comedies I've kept my LUTs kind of 'Kodak' – saturated and upbeat. But this show needed something different that affected skin tones and the Ant-Man suit, which {{dates back to the}} 1980s, so it looks a little run-down. What I loved about this LUT was how it allowed the costume to retain the color but took it from fire-engine red to something a little more weathered." ...|$|E
500|$|Responsible as CAS for {{building}} up Australia's air combat assets, in 1943 Jones had given an assurance to the Australian government {{that he could}} maintain a force of 73squadrons, despite Kenney's prediction that even the RAAF's then-currently approved strength of 45squadrons was beyond its capacity. In the event, {{by the end of}} the war Jones had expanded the RAAF to 70squadrons in the Pacific and Europe, including several heavy bomber units. One of his most controversial decisions of the war was during the invasion of Tarakan in May 1945 when he grounded Australian B-24 Liberator squadrons scheduled to take part in the attack, due to their crews having exceeded their monthly quota of flying hours. Bostock was not consulted, and said that he would have thankfully [...] "fallen <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> in the boards on the deck" [...] as he watched the attacking formations from a U.S. warship, minus the expected RAAF aircraft. Kenney sympathised with him; he once commented in his diary that [...] "Jones and Bostock... fight each other harder than the Japs".|$|E

The propagation is initiated by an incoming given energy flux imposed on the left boundary of the crack (see figure 1 where the flux is represented in dashed lines). Physically, the exchange surface between the optically thick medium and the energy source may be greatly modified by the fractures. This may have a significant impact on the energy balance of the considered system. In many situations, the intricacies of the cracked medium are such that it is almost impossible to carry out a direct calculation. Besides, many spatial scales may be involved simultaneously.

Above the roof, which is formed of nine slabs of stone {{weighing}} in total about 400 tons, are five compartments known as Relieving Chambers.

Thereafter Laodamia was described as possibly having committed suicide by stabbing herself, rather than be without him. According to Hyginus' Fabulae, however, the story runs like this: [...] "When Laodamia, daughter of Acastus, after her husband's loss had spent the three hours which she had asked from the gods, she could not endure her weeping and grief. And so she made a bronze likeness of her husband Protesilaus, put it in her room under pretense of sacred rites, and devoted herself to it.
