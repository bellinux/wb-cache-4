40|$|Data for speciated {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOC) evaluated in Santos-Dumont Airport and Antonio Carlos Jobim International Airport in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, are reported. VOC were evaluated by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC – FID) and mass spectrometry (GC – MS), following the U. S. EPA TO – 15 methodology. At Santos-Dumont Airport were quantified 1376 µg m- 3 of VOCs 10 m from runway, 408 µg m- 3 inside the airport building, and 116 µg m- 3 outside the airport area. At the <b>taxiway</b> <b>area</b> of the International Airport a total of 190 µg m- 3 of VOC were quantified. Toluene, the most abundant compound near the Santos-Dumont Airport runway, was obtained in a non-significative concentration outside the airport area. This fact suggests that this area is not noticeably impacted by air traffic. A computational model was developed using the OZIPR program and the SAPRC mechanism. Calculated ozone concentrations are higher than values for downtown area of Rio de Janeiro city. Simulated results show that, for the runway in Santos-Dumont Airport, olefins and aromatics contribute in 57 % and 15 %, respectively, to ozone formation, toluene being the major contributor.

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{the impact of}} aldehyde emissions at an airport on the air quality, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde concentrations were measured in the idle and <b>taxiway</b> <b>areas</b> of the Santos-Dumont national airport in Rio de Janeiro. The airport is located about 1 km from downtown Rio de Janeiro and {{had an average of}} 70, 000 landings and take-offs during 2007. A total of 129 samples were collected in the period from March to November 2007. Formaldehyde concentrations ranged from 2. 6 to 10. 3 µg m- 3, and acetaldehyde concentrations ranged from 4. 3 to 19. 7 µg m- 3. During the morning, A/F ratios (acetaldehyde/formaldehyde ratios, in mass units) were in the range 0. 7 - 1. 0. In the afternoon, formaldehyde concentrations were lower and acetaldehyde concentrations generally increased. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde concentrations were in the same range than values previously published for downtown and may not affect ozone production in a local scale...|$|R

40|$|The {{scheduling}} {{and execution of}} ramp area operations is a challenging task. Unlike aircraft maneuvers on <b>taxiways,</b> ramp <b>area</b> aircraft maneuvers are typically not confined to well-defined trajectories. The stochastic nature can force ramp area aircraft to slow down or stop along routes to the taxiway spot to avoid a loss of separation. To address this, we provide a tool for ramp controllers to help meet the assigned taxiway spot times. We formulate a mixed integer linear program model to compute the optimal push back windows that ensure conflict free trajectories. Initiating the push back within the optimal window ensures each departing aircraft can proceed along the route to the taxiway spot without having to slow down or stop for other traffic. I...|$|R
