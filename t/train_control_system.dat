5|$|Installation of {{centralized}} {{traffic control}} is scheduled to take place as part of nationwide implementation of European <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> <b>System,</b> {{which is scheduled to}} be completed within 2023. Capacity and efficiency on the line require more passing capacity, especially for longer freight trains. Thus the passing loop at Gudå Station has been proposed lengthened. To allow trains to run from the Meråker Line directly northward on the Nordland Line, a triangular line has been proposed at Hell Station. All regular freight trains on the line come from the north.|$|E
5|$|The Delhi Metro uses cab {{signalling}} {{along with}} a centralised automatic <b>train</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> consisting of automatic operation, protection and signalling modules. A 380MHz digital trunked TETRA radio communication system from Motorola is used on all lines to carry both voice and data information. For Blue Line Siemens Transportation Systems has supplied the electronic interlocking Sicas, the operation control system Vicos OC 500 and the automation control system LZB 700 M. An integrated system comprising optical fibre cable, on-train radio, CCTV, and a centralised clock and public address system is used for telecommunication during train operations as well as emergencies. For Red and Yellow lines ALSTOM has supplied signalling system and for Green and Violet lines Bombardier Transportation has supplied CITYFLO 350 signalling system.|$|E
5|$|Much {{criticism}} {{focused on}} the role of human error in the collision; once the engineer had forgotten (or missed) the approach signal there was no automatic system to prevent the collision. The NTSB noted that had a positive <b>train</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> been in place on the Metropolitan Subdivision the collision would have been less likely: the system would have detected MARC #286's unauthorized speed and stopped the train. The NTSB also strongly criticized CSX and the Federal Transit Administration for the removal of a signal between Kensington and Georgetown Junction as part of capacity improvements on the Metropolitan Subdivision. The NTSB argued that having this signal after Kensington would have reduced the likelihood of the sort of human error which caused the crash, and in the NTSB's view CSX and the FTA did not properly assess the effects of removing the signal.|$|E

30|$|The {{evolution}} {{process of}} rail signaling systems is from track-circuit signaling to advanced communication-based <b>train</b> <b>control</b> (CBTC) <b>systems.</b> The CBTC systems overcome the fundamental {{limitation of the}} conventional track-circuit-based system and provide short headways and better flexibility [46]. As pointed out by Morar [46], {{there is a clear}} trend in application of CBTC technology to DTO systems. Currently, 72 % of automated lines are based on communication-based <b>train</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> (either using inductive, radio, or microwave technology). It is important to investigate on the standards for the <b>train</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> with new technology to support interoperability and interchangeability. The European research project MODURBAN has developed the functional requirements, system architecture, and interfaces for the <b>train</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> in urban transit applications [47].|$|R

5|$|The NTSB {{found that}} Train 214 {{had come to}} a stop entirely within the faulty circuit B2-304, making it {{effectively}} invisible to the automatic <b>train</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Other trains had received speed commands of 0 when traveling through this circuit but had enough forward momentum {{to make it to the}} next circuit and resume detection and receipt of speed commands from the ATC system. Train 214 was going slower than normal because it was being driven in manual mode by its operator, and it came to a stop while remaining on circuit B2-304 and was therefore invisible. Train 112 behind it was given full speed commands by the ATC to proceed on the track. The investigation found that the emergency brakes had been applied by the operator of train 112 when train 214 came into view but it was too late to avert the collision.|$|E
5|$|The Queens Boulevard line {{is served}} by four {{overlapping}} routes. The E train serves the section between 50th Street and Briarwood, normally running express west of 71st Avenue. The F runs express from 36th Street to 71st Avenue and local east of 71st Avenue. The M and R serve local stops on the route west of 71st Avenue, with the M diverging from the line west of Fifth Avenue/53rd Street and the R splitting west of Queens Plaza. The E and F serve the line at all times, while the M runs on the line during weekdays only and the R runs on the line at all times except late nights. During late nights, the E makes local stops west of Briarwood to provide local service along the line. The routes experience frequent overcrowding during weekdays, and the Queens Boulevard line has among the highest rush-hour train frequencies in the system. A proposed upgrade to the line, to replace its signals with a communications-based <b>train</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> would add capacity to the line.|$|E

40|$|OVERVIEW: Providing {{safe and}} secure {{transport}} is the most basic principle of railroads, and this is made possible by <b>train</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> Drawing on its expertise in information control technologies, Hitachi has made enormous strides in addressing user needs by developing digital ATC (automatic <b>train</b> <b>control)</b> <b>systems</b> for application to congested rail lines, reducing train headways, improving passenger comfort with one-step brake control, {{reducing the amount of}} track-side equipment, and many other initiatives. However, these innovations are not just confined to congested routes, for every line can benefit from improved safety and lower costs for track-side equipment and maintenance. To meet these needs, it is essential to achieve closer cooperation between track-side and on-board systems than in the past, and to develop <b>train</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> with the flexibility to run autonomously. Leveraging its expertise and technological edge, Hitachi is moving boldly to develop new systems and a wide range of solutions calculated to enhance rail services in the near-term future...|$|R

However, the technology was not developed enough, and the manufacturer had to cancel these plans, mainly due to heat dissipation problems in locomotive decoders. Since then, these problems have been solved, Z scale has embraced advanced electronics (e.g., microprocessors originally developed for cell phones, surface-mount technology, etc.), and {{an increasing number of}} modellers have converted their locomotives to use third party digital model <b>train</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
