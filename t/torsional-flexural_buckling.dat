40|$|This paper {{describe}} the three dimensional {{finite element modeling}} and buckling analysis of conventional pallet racking system with semi rigid connection. In this study three dimensional models of conventional pallet racking system were prepared using the finiteelement program ANSYS and finite element analysis carried out on conventional pallet racks with the 18 types of column sections developed along with semi-rigid connections. A parametric study was carried out to compare the effective length approach and the finiteelement method for accuracy and appropriateness for cold-formed steel frame design. Numerous frame elastic buckling analyses were carried out to evaluate the alignment chart and the AISI <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> provisions. The parameters that influence the valueof Kx for column flexural buckling were examined in this study. The alignment chart and the AISI <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> provisions, used to obtain the effective lengths and elastic buckling load of members were also evaluated. Results showed that the elastic buckling load obtained from the AISI <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> provisions is generally conservative compared to the results obtained from performing frame elastic buckling analysis. Results also showed that, the effective length approach is more conservative than the finite element approach...|$|E
40|$|Thin-walled {{centrically}} compressed {{members with}} non-symmetrical or mono-symmetrical cross-sections can buckle in a <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> mode. Vlasov developed {{a system of}} governing differential equations of the stability of such member cases. Solving these coupled equations in an analytic way is only possible in simple cases. Therefore, GoÄ¾denvejzer introduced an approximate method for the solution of this system to calculate the critical axial force of <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling.</b> Moreover, this {{can also be used}} in cases of members with various boundary conditions in bending and torsion. This approximate method for the calculation of critical force has been adopted into norms. Nowadays, we can also solve governing differential equations by numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM). Therefore, in this paper, the results of the approximate method and the FEM were compared to each other, while considering the FEM as a reference method. This comparison shows any discrepancies of the approximate method. Attention was also paid to when and why discrepancies occur. The approximate method can be used in practice by considering some simplifications, which ensure safe results...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} numerical {{research into the}} strengthening of steel columns under load using welded plates. So far, the experimental {{research in this field}} has been limited mostly to flexural buckling of columns and the preload had low effect on the column load resistance. This paper focuses on the local buckling and <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> of columns. Three sets of three columns each were tested. Two sets corresponding to the base section (D) and strengthened section (E) were tested without preloading and were used for comparison. Columns from set (F) were first preloaded to the load corresponding to the half of the load resistance of the base section (D). Then the columns were strengthened and after they cooled, they were loaded to failure. The columns strengthened under load (F) had similar average resistance as the columns welded without preloading (E), meaning the preload affects even members susceptible to local buckling and <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> only slightly. This is the same behaviour as of the tested columns from previous research into flexural buckling. The study includes results gained from finite element models of the problem created in ANSYS software. The results obtained from the experiments and numerical simulations were compared...|$|E

The theory was recently extended to laminated bars fabricated from advanced composite materials. The purpose {{of this research is}} to provide a study and assessment of the extended theory. The focus is on flexural and <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> of thin-walled, open section, laminated composite columns. Buckling loads are computed from the theory using a linear bifurcation analysis and a geometrically nonlinear beam column analysis by the finite element method. Results from the analyses are compared to available test data...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 This study {{consists}} of three parts: 1) Part A: Limiting Height Evaluation for Composite Wall Tests, 2) Part B: Mid-Span Deflection Evaluation for Composite Wall Tests, and 3) Part C: Nominal Axial Strength Evaluation for Wall-Braced Wall Stud Columns. The purpose of Part A is to develop experimentally-based limiting heights for interior, nonload-bearing wall panels. Lateral load is applied perpendicular to the gypsum board sheathing over the entire panel. Testing for the composite wall tests complies with ICBO ES AC 86 and ASTM E 72 - 80 using a uniform, vacuum chamber loading on vertical 4 -foot-wide specimens. Limiting heights for specific deflection limits are developed over the range of typical design loads. The test specimens for Part B are the same wall panels used in Part A. The panels are treated as simply supported beams for the analysis. The objective of Part B is to properly reflect {{the influence of the}} following factors in the calculation of mid-span deflection for the panel: connection slip, local buckling, perforations in the stud web, and effects from joints in the sheathing. Predicted deflections based on an upper bound for connection rigidity were closest to experimental deflections. The objective of Part C is to evaluate the axial strength of composite wall stud panels. The panels {{are similar to those of}} Part A except the studs are load-bearing and an axial load is applied to the centroid of the gross cross section, and no lateral loads are applied. The bracing effect from wallboard and fasteners is represented by continuous elastic springs over the length of the column. The column is subject to flexural buckling and <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling.</b> Using 1) the differential equation of equilibrium, and 2) an energy method, the flexural and <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> loads are evaluated. Equations to determine the buckling loads are developed considering typical end-conditions. Local buckling effects and nominal buckling stress are determined according to 1986 and 1996 AISI specifications. Predictions and observed strengths from the limited experimental database were in good agreement. The predictions accurately represent the overall <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> failure for the gypsum board-braced wall studs and its independence of stud spacing...|$|E
40|$|Study {{is made of}} the {{formulation}} of a rotation-free boundary condition for angle specimenscentrally compressed in early tests. Confirmed by the extremum principle of potential energyand calculus of variation, the derived boundary condition is combined with the equilibriumequations of the <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> of a thin-walled open cross section, to solve the bi-furcation problem through direct integration. The theoretical solution shows that the criticalload for the rotation-free boundary condition is identical with that for the conventional simple-support condition. The solution also indicates, in spite of free rotation, that no twist takes placeat {{one end of the}} buckled angle relative to the other, with maximum twist at the mid cross sec-tion relative to the both ends. These results are compared with early experimental observations,to reach reasonable agreement...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{applications}} {{in the use of}} light gauge steel members have been concerned with developing large scale systems built entirely from cold-formed steel members. An explicit analysis of such structures is complicated by the different phenomena that the structure may be prone to during loading. In particular, elastic buckling phenomena is an important consideration in the design of such structures since the load at which buckling occurs often provides a close upper bound to the carrying capacity of the structure. The first part of this two-part thesis (Part I, Chaptersl- 8) has been devoted to general methods of analysis of the <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> of thin-walled structures. A review of previous investigations and the available methods of solution is presented. A general finite element formulation of the <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> of thin-walled structures has been derived. The resulting elastic geometric matrix can be used to analyse structures with monosymmetrical members. It also includes the effect of sectorial-monosymmetry for cross-sections without any axis of symmetry. A general transformation matrix has been developed to allow for the application of the finite element method to the three-dimensional elastic stability analysis of space and portal frames. The validity and accuracy of the new finite element formulation have been checked by analysing a number of different elastic lateral buckling problems for which exact or highly accurate solutions by other techniques are available. An experimental program was carried out on simply supported cold-formed steel z-beams. The first part of this program was undertaken to check the validity of the finite element calculations of the bimoments caused by nonuniform torsion. The second part was devoted to elastic lateral buckling of z-beams under combined bending and torsion. The second part of this thesis (Part II, Chapter 9) deals with the analysis of hipped roof structures with corrugated steel roof sheeting. A simple theoretical model has been suggested. The model has been used to perform an elastic linear analysis of the behaviour of two types of the hipped roof structures. The theoretical results are compared with previous experimental results for these two structures...|$|E
40|$|Two {{designs of}} square-celled {{metallic}} honeycomb structures fabricated by a modified extrusion technology {{based on a}} powder feedstock were investigated. The strength and ductility of these cellular materials are achieved by an austenitic CrNi (AISI 304) steel matrix particle reinforced by an MgO partially-stabilized zirconia building up their cell wall microstructure. Similar to the mechanical behaviour of the bulk materials, the strengthening mechanism and the martensitic phase transformations in the cell walls {{are affected by the}} deformation temperature and the nominal strain rate. The microstructure evolution during quasi-static and dynamic impact compression up to high strain rates of 103 1 /s influences the buckling and failure behaviour of the honeycomb structures. In contrast to bending-dominated quasi-isotropic networks like open-celled metal foams, axial compressive loading to the honeycombâs channels causes membrane stretching as well as crushing of the vertical cell node elements and cell walls. The presented honeycomb materials differ geometrically in their cell wall thickness-to-cell size-ratio. Therefore, the failure behaviour is predominantly controlled by global buckling and <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling,</b> respectively, accompanied by plastic matrix flow and strengthening of the cell wall microstructure...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} presence of buckling modes in built-up columns made from pultruded fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) profiles when flexural instability is coupled with torsional instability. This phenomenon is already {{well known in the}} field of steel construction and is tested and emphasized with the use of thin walled open cross sections of pultruded FRP materials in testing to analyze the effects of local buckling due to FRPâs or thotropy and high deformability. Also through previous tests on columns made by singular ââCââ shapes that create the built-up columns tested, the study presents the confidence between experimental results for the pultruded FRP built-up columns and the available formulas for calculating the expected buckling interactions. The investigation shows that <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> is confirmed but is also combined with a local buckling that first influences the buckling interactions. From a practical application point of view, the study examines a comparison between experimental and formulation characterization of buckling analysis with open cross sections assumed as equivalent to the built-up cross sections. The ratio between the different critical loads and their chronolog y to collapse is described...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Doubly {{symmetric}} I-section columns {{are often}} utilised in portal frame construction. The sheeting (or cladding) is carried by sheeting rails {{connected to the}} outer flange of these columns. Although it is common practice to include the sheeting rails in the longitudinal bracing system, by connecting the sheeting rail to the cross-bracing, designers must be wary because the connection between column and sheeting rail will not prevent twisting of the columns cross-section. It has been shown ([11], [12], [17]), that by including this eccentric restraint into the bracing of the column, that a <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> mode of failure can occur when the column is subjected to axial load only. It was seen that this phenomenon is provided for in BS 5950 [18], but is not present in many other design codes of practice, {{in spite of this}} phenomenon being relatively well known. In some cases the compression resistance of a column can be significantly reduced when compared to that of a flexural buckled configuration. Previous work performed by Helwig and Yura [15] proposed specific column to sheeting rail connections which would allow for the sheeting rails to be used as elastic torsional braces and effectively rigid lateral braces. However, it is the objective of this investigation to determine if it is possible to include the eccentric sheeting rails into the bracing system, even when using a relatively simple cleat connection with only two bolts onto the sheeting rail. The objective of the research was investigated by conducting experimental tests coupled with a series of detailed finite element analyses. The purpose of the experimental set-up was to investigate the behaviour of a column laterally supported on one flange by a continuous sheeting rail and to compare it to the behaviour of a column laterally supported on both flanges by means of fly-braces (âkneebracesâ). The behaviour of the columns, as determined by the experimental tests, was validated by the finite element analyses. The evident conclusion that can be drawn is that, for the case of a continuous sheeting rail, connected to column simply by two bolts and a cleat, that sufficient torsional restraint is provided to the column to prevent <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> from being critical. This result is helpful, as it means that the buckling capacity of a column can be increased four-fold by enforcing the second flexural buckling mode instead of the first mode through utilising a continuous sheeting rail connected to a cross-bracing system as longitudinal bracing on the columns. This can be achieved without the need to provide any specific detailing to the column to sheeting rail connection. It is however, recommended that further experimental work be conducted on varying lengths of column in order to further validate the results of this work...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. Because cold-formed {{stainless}} steel {{is a new}} type of light steel material and dose not {{have a long history of}} utilisation in structures, there are many issues that need to be researched and discussed. Making a more thorough investigation and study of cold-formed {{stainless steel}}s is essential. As a numerical analysis tool, the finite element method proves to be useful in structural analysis. The buckling modes of cold-formed stainless steel members, such as local, flexural, torsional and <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling,</b> are well known and well documented in design specifications. Distortional buckling is a special kind of buckling mode, which is less well known. Researchers have recently paid more attention to this problem. For stainless steel structures, it is necessary to investigate their behaviour when distortional buckling occurs. In this project, the distortional buckling of cold-formed stainless steel columns under axial compression is investigated. The finite element method is used to analyse and calculate different buckling modes, especially distortional buckling. This is compared to experimental results and other theoretical predictions. The ABAQUS finite element code is used throughout. Finite element modelling is very important prior to processing and analysis. ABAQUS models are created to study distortional buckling. The initial imperfection of structural members is taken into account with these models, using specific sine wave descriptions with respect to different structural parameters. A dynamic processing approach is chosen in the finite element analysis. The effectiveness and accuracy of these models have been verified by both experimental tests and theoretical calculations. Buckling mode and behaviour are predicted and analysed in terms of the finite element models and processes. Suggestions are made for buckling analysis and design based on the research results...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} {{investigations into the}} compressive buckling behaviour of unidirectional CFRP thin- walled channel sections subject to built-in end conditions are described. Local and overall modes of instability are considered {{and the effects of}} transverse shear on both modes are discussed. Particular emphasis is given to the development of local instability theory for orthotropic materials and the basis for design charts for a range of thin-walled orthotropic sections is included. These analytical developments are accompanied by an investigation of numerical methods in which a finite difference technique is applied to single orthotropic plates and a finite element programme is used with multi-plate sections. Good correlation is observed between analytically and numerically derived buckling loads. Buckling analyses are confined to classical linearised theories and the sensitivities to eccentric loading, applied end moments, and imperfect end restraints are demonstrated. The pultrusion process for manufacture of continuous unidirectional CFRP thin-walled sections is described and suggestions for its development to multidirectional composites are given. Test, methods for the measurement of the principal mechanical properties of unidirectional CFRP from, in some cases, small specimens are detailed. Measured properties are shown to correlate with fibre volume fractions obtained from areal analyses of polished sections. The design of a strain, gauge bridge amplifier and data logging system utilised during column testing is included. The Southwell method is shown to be applicable to flexural and <b>torsional-flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> modes and in general measured buckling loads fall short of theory by 50 %. Local buckling loads are indistinct although buckled forms correspond to theoretical predictions and little post buckling strength is observed. A theoretically derived buckling chart for unidirectional CFRP channel sections is presented and a minimum design safety factor of 2 is recommended. Camborne School of Mine...|$|E
40|$|Columns are {{essential}} members in a structural system. Their types include pure axial compression members (rolled and built-up steel sections) and beam-columns. Columns are important members and thus many {{scholars in the}} past have been dedicated to the column research. This study presents a direct experimental verification of the AISC Specification for built-up compression members and steel tubs filled with aggregate concrete. To find out the difference of different steels (rolled and cold-formed), we also investigate the AISI Standard of slender C-shaped cold-formed steel members with web openings. The following findings can be drawn from this study and are specified as follows: 1. The AISC Specification for steel columns appears quite conservative, but they are still in the range of reasonable acceptance. 2. The AISI Standard for columns also appears reasonable (Ptest/Pu = 1. 02 ~ 1. 21), for column members with web openings, they are too conservative (Ptest/Pu = 1. 22 ~ 1. 54). 3. The effective sectional area concept was adopted to conduct the analysis of cold-formed steel. When consider the width-to-thickness ratio of members, analysis is long and tedious procedure. The most difficulty job is the calculation of warping constant (Cw) for an open thin-walled open section which is a tedious and difficult task and thus presenting an obstacle to the routine design in practice. This study proposes a step-by-step numerical procedure for evaluating the warping constant of a general open thin-walled section. The proposed procedure is a reliable and useful tool for computing the warping constant for an arbitrary rolled and cold-formed steel open section, which does not need a sophisticated computer software being used. æ±å­çºå£åæ§ä»¶ä¹éç¨±ï¼å¶é¡ååæ¬ç´è»¸å£æ§ä»¶(åé¼æ·é¢ãçµåæ·é¢) ãåææ¿åè»¸å£èå½ç©çæ§ä»¶åå±¬å£åæ§ä»¶ãé·ä¹ä»¥ä¾æ±æ§ä»¶çåå­¸è¡çºä¸ç´é½æ¯ç±éç ç©¶ä¸»é¡ï¼æ¬ç ç©¶éå°AISCè¦ç¯ä¸­åé¼æ·é¢(rolled section) ãçµåæ·é¢(build-up section) ï¼åé¼ç®¡æ··åå(CFT) é²è¡æ±æ§ä»¶è¦ç¯ä¹æ¢è¨èçè«æ¨å°ï¼ä¸¦ä½ä»¥ç¸éä¹å¯¦é©ä»¥è²æ¯è¼ãçºäºæ´äºè§£ä¸åé¼æéä¹å·®ç°ï¼äº¦éå°AISIè¦ç¯ä¸­å·è»åé¼æ§ä»¶(Cold-Formed Steel) é²è¡ç¸éä¹ç ç©¶èå¯¦é©ï¼ä»¥æå¾çè«ãè¦ç¯èå¯¦é©æ¯è¼ä¸­æ´å ç­è§£åå£é¼æ§ä»¶ä¹åå­¸è¡çºã æ¬è«æä¸»è¦çµè«åæ¬ 1. ç¶ç±çè«æ¸å¼èå¯¦é©çæ¯è¼ï¼AISCè¦ç¯å°æ¼æ±æ§ä»¶ä¹æ¿è¼è½åæ¯ç¸ç¶ä¿å®ï¼æå°å¨åççç¯åä¹å§ã 2.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis addresses an increasing demand from the cold-formed steel production industry for more stable load-bearing elements. As buildings constructed entirely from cold-formed steel profiles and sheeting increase their spans, heights and bays, light steel frames not only become more impressive, but the applications of light-steel framing widen. The limited stability of standard cold-formed steel elements is {{resolved in the}} thesis by using primary load-bearing elements composed of multiple profiles. Built-up (composed) members: â¢ are assembled from multiple, standard cold-formed steel profiles, â¢ offer a number of benefits in terms of production, transportation, storage, flexibility in shape and arrangement, and overall cost, â¢ can carry higher loads {{than the sum of}} what the constituents can take up when used separately. The thesis concerns built-up columns of intermediate and high slenderness; namely, these are elements that undergo all of the common types of buckling that occur in thin-walled structures â local, distortional and overall (flexural, torsional, and <b>torsional-flexural)</b> <b>buckling.</b> Built-up sections are investigated due to their potential to achieve notably higher load-bearing capacity and avoid overall and distortional buckling occurrences that may compromise a structureâs integrity. Currently, no reliable design methods exist for such elements in structural design codes worldwide. The research aims to (1) understand the response of such members in terms of load-bearing capacity, stiffness, failure modes, scatter in capacity, and (2) recognise the design methods that are required. The focus of the doctoral studies is on members loaded in axial compression; however, the design under combined forces is also addressed. Experimental and numerical investigations are performed in order to study the behaviour of built-up columns and beams in weak-axis bending. Results are compared to analytical predictions based on existing design methods. Investigations concern a variety of cross-sections, some of which have been taken from design practice, while others are contrived and optimised within the doctoral programme with the goal to reach considerably higher load-bearing capacity and better stability. Design partially or fully based on numerical analysis is considered and its advantages and disadvantages are presented. The manuscript documents the rather complex instability of built-up thin-walled systems, which was observed both experimentally and in numerical analysis. On many occasions, the presented failures comprise multiple, interacting or mixed buckling modes, often combined with plastic yielding in the higher load stages. Based on the results from the various investigations presented in the manuscript, a design method is proposed which is an extension based on currently existing design techniques. A special emphasis is put on simplifying the design process. The goal is to eliminate ambiguities, avoid a lack of clarity and structure, and thus prevent mistakes in everyday design practice. This is in line with a contemporary tendency in coldformed steel design to simplify design methods and step away from overcomplicated, unclear methods. An indirect benefit of a simple and concise design method is the promotion of the structural system itself â a simple, clear and structured design technique will stimulate engineers to use light steel as a solution to their everyday design tasks. status: publishe...|$|E
