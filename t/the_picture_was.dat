5|$|According to Diodorus, Philip {{marched on}} his enemies in this {{alliance}} {{before they had}} chance to combine, and forced them to ally to Macedon instead. However, other sources suggest that <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> actually much more complex, and that Philip in turn defeated each of the powers {{over the next few}} years, with the exception of Athens.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} film used for <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> uncharacteristic {{for the time}} and {{was a sign of}} the long {{production}} process. Chaplin shot 314,256 feet of film, and the completed film ran 8,093 feet. This made a shooting ratio of almost 39 feet of film for each foot of film that made it in the final version.|$|E

5|$|The {{design for}} the album's artwork was by Hipgnosis, the company {{responsible}} for previous Wings album covers such as Venus and Mars (1975) and the recent Wings Greatest compilation (1978). The front cover depicts the five members of Wings in a room, looking down through space at Planet Earth through an open hatchway in the floor; <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> taken by photographer John Shaw at his London studio. Photos of the individual band members appeared on the back cover, credited to Linda and Paul McCartney.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> painted between January and October 1891 {{to commemorate}} the Constitution's centenary. It {{was one of the}} last works by Matejko, who died in November 1893. The {{painting}} was displayed in Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine) until 1920, when it was moved to Kraków. It was hidden during World War II and later moved to Warsaw, where it now hangs in the Royal Castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{total cost}} of <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> {{reported}} variously as $935,000 or $1.5 million. Even the lower figure was an exceptionally large amount for the time. To recoup its costs, MGM kept the film in circulation for many years. The running time of the film in previews was 160 minutes. Major cuts were made afterward, however. The final running time for the film was either 117 or 120 minutes.|$|E

5|$|There were {{setbacks}} with distribution, however. United Artists, {{which had}} {{ownership of the}} movie, changed hands and the new owners {{had no interest in}} the movie. Carradine bought the movie back from U.A., and set out to find a distributor. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> picked up by Crown International, which specialized in teen exploitation films. Just two weeks before the opening was scheduled, Carradine was still shooting some additional scenes.|$|E
5|$|Van Peebles {{began to}} develop the film after being offered a three-picture {{contract}} for Columbia Pictures. No studio would finance the film, so Van Peebles funded the film himself, shooting it independently {{over a period of}} 19 days, performing all of his own stunts and appearing in several sex scenes, reportedly unsimulated. He received a $50,000 loan from Bill Cosby to complete the project. The film's fast-paced montages and jump-cuts were unique features in American cinema at the time. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> censored in some markets, and received mixed critical reviews. However, it has left a lasting impression on African-American cinema.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of Spitfire and The Lake, RKO cast Hepburn in The Little Minister (1934), based on a Victorian novel by James Barrie, {{in an attempt to}} repeat the success of Little Women. There was no such recurrence, and <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> a {{commercial}} failure. The romantic drama Break of Hearts (1935) with Charles Boyer was poorly reviewed and also lost money. After three forgettable films, success returned to Hepburn with Alice Adams (1935), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social ladder. Hepburn loved the book and was delighted to be offered the role. The film was a hit, one of Hepburn's personal favorites, and gave the actress her second Oscar nomination. She received the second most votes, after winner Bette Davis.|$|E

50|$|One way a zograscope enhances depth {{perception}} is by minimizing other depth cues that specify the flatness and pictorial nature of <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> <b>The</b> image <b>is</b> magnified, perhaps {{giving it a}} visual angle similar to the real scene <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> depicting. <b>The</b> edges of <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>are</b> blocked by <b>the</b> frame of the lens. The light coming from the lens to the eye is collimated, preventing accommodation.|$|R

5|$|Scully {{does the}} autopsy on the {{invisible}} body by covering it in powder. Mulder, meanwhile, researches {{the owner of}} the container. He learns that the man in <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> extremely wealthy and lucky for a short period, before he died with a giant oversized penis. Mulder believes the woman in the picture is responsible for everything, and determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn. Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had a lot of power and lost it in a bad way.|$|E
5|$|After graduating college, Briskin {{worked as}} an accountant. Briskin entered the film {{industry}} as an accountant at Cohn-Brandt-Cohn Film Sales in 1920. In 1924, when the Cohn brothers incorporated CBC as Columbia Pictures, he left the studio and created an independent production company with George H. Davis named Banner Productions. The company was scheduled to produce 8 films, four {{on the east coast}} and four in California. The company was incorporated in May 1924, and produced over 20 films between 1925 and 1927. Briskin gave his brother, Irving, his start in the film industry, as an auditor for Banner. Irving would go on to be a film producer in his own right. The company's first film was The Truth About Women, a 1924 melodrama directed by Burton King, and starring Hope Hampton and Lowell Sherman. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> filmed at the Whitman Bennett Studios near Yonkers, New York. The next film Briskin would produce was The Man Without a Heart, again directed by King and filmed at the Bennett Studios, this time starring Kenneth Harlan and Jane Novak. In addition to producing the films, Briskin would also travel around the country making sales deals for the company's films. In 1925 Briskin would produce the melodrama, The Phantom Express, starring Ethel Shannon and George Periolat. This was followed in 1926 by the film Brooding Eyes, starring the legendary Lionel Barrymore.|$|E
5|$|MGM lent Tracy to Twentieth Century-Fox for the Western film Broken Lance, {{his only}} {{appearance}} of 1954. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> well received. In 1955 Tracy turned down William Wyler's The Desperate Hours because {{he refused to}} take second-billing to Humphrey Bogart. Instead, Tracy appeared as a one-armed protagonist who faces the hostility {{of a small town}} in Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), a film directed by John Sturges. For his work, Tracy received a fifth Oscar nomination and was awarded the Best Actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival. He had personally been unhappy with the picture, and threatened to leave it during production. This behavior became a regular occurrence for the aging Tracy, who was increasingly lethargic and cynical. He began production on Tribute to a Bad Man in the summer of 1955, but pulled out when the location shooting in Colorado gave him altitude sickness. The trouble caused by the picture fractured Tracy's relationship with MGM. In June 1955 he was the last remaining star of the studio's heyday, but with his contract up for renewal—Tracy opted to go independent {{for the first time in}} his movie career.|$|E

40|$|While {{many studies}} have shown that a task-irrelevant emotionally arousing {{stimulus}} can interfere with the processing of a shortly following target, it remains unclear whether an emotional stimulus can also retro-actively interrupt the ongoing processing of an earlier target. In two experiments, we examined whether the presentation of a negative emotionally arousing picture can disrupt working memory consolidation of a preceding visual target. In both experiments, the effects of negative emotional <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> compared with <b>the</b> effects of neutral pictures. In Experiment 1, <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> entirely task-irrelevant whereas in Experiment 2 <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> associated with a 2 -alternative forced choice task that required participants to respond to the color of a frame surrounding <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that the appearance of <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> did not interfere with target consolidation when <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> task-irrelevant, whereas such interference <b>was</b> observed when <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> associated with a 2 -AFC task. Most importantly, however, the results showed no effects of whether <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> had neutral or emotional content. Implications for further research are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Meeting Chloe at {{the diner}} where her mother Joyce (Cissy Jones) works, they decide to {{experiment}} with Max's power at Chloe's secret scrapyard hideout. However, strain causes Max to have a nosebleed and faint. Chloe takes her back to Blackwell, but class is halted when everyone is called out to the courtyard. Kate commits suicide by jumping off {{the roof of the}} girls' dorm. Max manages to rewind and time stops unexpectedly as she reaches Kate, giving Max the opportunity to convince her to come down. Max ultimately resolves to uncover what happened to Kate and Chloe's missing friend Rachel Amber. Max and Chloe break into the principal's office that night to investigate and enter the pool for a swim before evading David Madsen (Don McManus), head of security at Blackwell and Chloe's stepfather, and fleeing back to Chloe's place. The next morning, they sneak into the motorhome of Frank Bowers (Daniel Bonjour), drug dealer and friend of Rachel, and learn that Rachel was in a relationship with Frank and lied to Chloe about it, causing Chloe to storm off feeling betrayed. Max returns to her dormitory and examines a childhood photo of her and Chloe, but is suddenly transported to the day <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> taken. Max prevents Chloe's father William (Joe Ochman) from dying in a traffic collision, which inadvertently creates an alternative reality where William is alive but Chloe has been paralysed from the neck down {{as a result of a}} collision in her own car.|$|E
5|$|Neuroscientist and {{psychologist}} Pascal Wallisch {{states that}} while inherently ambiguous stimuli {{have been known}} to vision science for many years, this is the first such stimulus in the colour domain that was {{brought to the attention of}} science by social media. He attributes differential perceptions to differences in illumination and fabric priors, but also notes that the stimulus is highly unusual insofar as the perception of most people does not switch. If it does, it does so only on very long time scales, which is highly unusual for bistable stimuli, so perceptual learning might be at play. In addition, he says that discussions of this stimulus are not frivolous, as the stimulus is both of interest to science and a paradigmatic case of how different people can sincerely see the world differently, an acknowledgement of which is a precondition for world peace. Daniel Hardiman-McCartney of the College of Optometrists stated that <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> ambiguous, suggesting that the illusion was caused by a strong yellow light shining onto the dress, and human perception of the colours of the dress and light source by comparing them with other colours and objects in the picture. The philosopher Barry C. Smith compared the phenomenon with Ludwig Wittgenstein and the rabbit–duck illusion.|$|E
