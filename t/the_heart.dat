5|$|Humans {{have known}} about <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> since ancient times, {{although}} its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood. From the primarily religious views of earlier societies towards <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> ancient Greeks are considered {{to have been the}} primary seat of scientific understanding of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> in the ancient world. Aristotle considered <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to be organ responsible for creating blood; Plato considered <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> as the source of circulating blood and Hippocrates noted blood circulating cyclically from the body through <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to the lungs. Erasistratos (304–250 BCE) noted <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> as a pump, causing dilation of blood vessels, and noted that arteries and veins both radiate from <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> becoming progressively smaller with distance, although he believed they were filled with air and not blood. He also discovered <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> valves.|$|E
5|$|Afterload, or {{how much}} {{pressure}} <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> must generate to eject blood at systole, is influenced by vascular resistance. It can be influenced by narrowing of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> valves (stenosis) or contraction or relaxation of the peripheral blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|CT scans, chest X-rays {{and other}} forms of imaging can help {{evaluate}} the heart's size, evaluate for signs of pulmonary oedema, and indicate whether there is fluid around <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> They are also useful for evaluating the aorta, the major blood vessel which leaves <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cardiomyopathy is a {{noticeable}} deterioration of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> muscle's ability to contract, {{which can lead}} to heart failure. The causes of many types of cardiomyopathy are poorly understood; some identified causes include alcohol, toxins, systemic disease such as sarcoidosis, and congenital conditions such as HOCM. The types of cardiomyopathy are described according to how they affect heart muscle. Cardiomyopathy can cause <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to become enlarged (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), constrict the outflow tracts of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> (restrictive cardiomyopathy), or cause <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to dilate and impact the efficiency of its beating (dilated cardiomyopathy). HOCM is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in young athletes.|$|E
5|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} {{is one such}} operation. In this operation, one or more arteries {{surrounding}} <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> that have become narrowed are bypassed. This is done by taking blood vessels harvested from {{another part of the}} body. Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal mammary artery. Because this operation involves <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> tissue, a machine is used so that blood can bypass <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> during the operation.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> which when inflamed is called pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects the ability of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute heart failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> and adversely affect the function of <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> The fluid can {{be removed from the}} pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E

25|$|Normally, <b>the</b> <b>heart’s</b> {{pacemaker}} regulates <b>the</b> {{contraction of}} <b>the</b> <b>heart’s</b> ventricles. Ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia occur {{when there are}} irregularities in the electrical signals from the pacemaker, causing <b>the</b> <b>heart’s</b> ventricles to contract abnormally and preventing blood from circulating throughout the body. Ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia can lead to sudden cardiac death if not treated immediately.|$|R
5|$|Exercise {{and fitness}} levels, age, body temperature, basal {{metabolic}} rate, {{and even a}} person's emotional state can all affect <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> rate. High levels of the hormones epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones can increase <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> rate. The levels of electrolytes including calcium, potassium, and sodium can also influence the speed and regularity of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> rate; low blood oxygen, low blood pressure and dehydration may increase it.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve stenosis, {{which is the most}} common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with this condition, the pulmonary valve is improperly formed which causes <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final results of this condition can be swelling of fluid in the chambers of <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> thickening of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> muscle known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.|$|E
5|$|In humans, other mammals, and birds, <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> {{is divided}} into four chambers: upper left and right atria; and lower left and right {{ventricle}}s. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. <b>The</b> <b>heart</b> is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains {{a small amount of}} fluid. The wall of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>heart</b> {{derives from}} splanchnopleuric mesenchyme in the neural plate which forms the {{cardiogenic}} region. Two endocardial tubes form here that fuse {{to form a}} primitive heart tube known as the tubular heart.

This places the chambers and major vessels into the correct alignment for the developed heart. Further development will include the septa and valves formation and remodelling of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> chambers. By the end of the fifth week the septa are complete and <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> valves are completed by the ninth week.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>heart</b> is cone-shaped, {{with its}} base {{positioned}} upwards and tapering {{down to the}} apex. An adult heart has a mass of 250–350 grams (9–12oz). <b>The</b> <b>heart</b> is typically {{the size of a}} fist: 12cm (5in) in length, 8cm (3.5in) wide, and 6cm (2.5in) in thickness. Well-trained athletes can have much larger hearts due to the effects of exercise on <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> muscle, similar to the response of skeletal muscle.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>heart</b> pumps blood with {{a rhythm}} {{determined}} {{by a group of}} pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node. These generate a current that causes contraction of <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> <b>The</b> <b>heart</b> receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. <b>The</b> <b>heart</b> beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>heart</b> {{receives}} nerve {{signals from}} the vagus nerve and from nerves arising from the sympathetic trunk.

Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> rate, and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> rate.
