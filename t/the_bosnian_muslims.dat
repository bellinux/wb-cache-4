5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Muslims</b> sought {{protection}} and {{independence from the}} NDH, and saw German support {{as a means to}} achieve those aims. Prominent Bosnian Muslims were friendly towards Germany, and Bosnians were generally nostalgic over the former period of Habsburg (Austro-Hungarian) rule. This push was strongly opposed by Pavelić as counter to the territorial integrity of the NDH. By November 1942, these Muslim autonomists were desperate to protect their people and wrote to Adolf Hitler asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich. While this idea did not receive Hitler's approval, possibly because {{he did not want to}} create problems for Pavelić, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler saw this as an opportunity to create a Waffen-SS recruiting zone in the NDH to attract Bosnian Muslims. In early 1943, Hitler authorised the raising of the first SS division to be recruited from a non-Germanic people, the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian). The division was to be raised primarily from the Muslim population of the NDH.|$|E

40|$|National audienceIn the interwar period, the {{political}} elites of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Muslim</b> community considered {{first of all}} Yugoslavia as an institutional framework allowing the preservation of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Muslim</b> identity.

But, in 1991, {{the leaders of the}} Party of Democratic Action (SDA), <b>the</b> main <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Muslim</b> political party, opted definitively for the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Dans l'entre-deux-guerres, les élites politiques de la communauté musulmane bosnienne ont avant tout considéré la Yougoslavie comme un cadre institutionnel permettant la préservation de l'identité musulmane bosnienne. Dans la période communiste, la sécularisation de la population musulmane et la reconnaissance officielle de la nation musulmane ont conduit à une identification beaucoup plus forte avec l'idée yougoslave. Mais, en 1991, les dirigeants du Parti de l'action démocratique (SDA), principal parti musulman bosnien, ont définitivement opté pour l'indépendance de la Bosnie-Herzégovine...|$|R

These were reserved for duties requiring close combat engagements, simply because their skill and experience was too valuable to be wasted in other less complicated duties. The war attracted foreign fighters and mercenaries from various countries. Volunteers came to fight {{for a variety of reasons}} including religious or ethnic loyalties and in some cases for money. As a general rule, Bosniaks received support from Islamic countries, Serbs from Eastern Orthodox countries, and Croats from Catholic countries. The presence of foreign fighters is well documented, however none of these groups comprised more than 5 percent of any of the respective armies' total manpower strength.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 General-Major Radislav Krstić {{was indicted}} for genocide, crimes against {{humanity}} and violations of the laws or customs of war, based on his alleged role in the events {{in and around the}} Bosniak enclave of Srebrenica between 11 July 1995 and 1 November 1995 at the ICTY. On August 2, 2001, after the Trial Chamber was convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that a crime of genocide was committed in Srebrenica, it had convicted Krstić of genocide, who became the first person thus convicted before the Tribunal, and sentenced him to 46 years in prison. The Appeals Chamber had, after upholding the Trial Chamber's finding that Bosnian Serb forces had carried out genocide in Srebrenica, among other things, reduced Krstić’s responsibility for genocide and for the murder of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Muslims</b> from that of a direct participant to that of an aider and abettor, and shortened his sentence to 35 years in prison. Krsić was subsequently transferred to the United Kingdom to serve his prison sentence at Wakefield Prison, but was later transferred to Long Lartin Prison.|$|E
500|$|The romantic {{notions that}} Himmler had about <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Muslims</b> were {{probably}} {{significant in the}} division's genesis. He was personally fascinated by the Islamic faith and believed that Islam created fearless soldiers.

He thought that Muslim men would make perfect SS soldiers as Islam [...] "promises them Heaven if they fight and are killed in action." [...] As for their ethnic background and SS requirements, it appears that Himmler accepted the theories advanced by both Croatian and German nationalists that the Croatian people, including the Muslims, were not ethnic Slavs but pure Aryans of either Gothic or Iranian descent.|$|E

The idea about Yugoslavism was not yet present, for <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Muslim</b> political elite had not even entertained such thoughts until the final months of World War I. It was Spaho who first articulated the pan-Yugoslavist sentiment in <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Muslim</b> community.

[...] "If it’s a choice between the CIA and the Iranians, they’ll take the Iranians any day." [...] By war’s end, public opinion polls showed some 86 percent Bosnian Muslims had a positive opinion of Iran. Hezbollah initially sent 150 fighters to fight against the Bosnian Serb Army, the Bosnian Muslims' main opponent in the war.

500|$|In {{an effort}} to secure the loyalty of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Muslims,</b> Pavelić ordered that a {{property}} in Zagreb be converted into a mosque that he named the [...] "Poglavnik's Mosque". Despite Pavelić's assurances of equality with the Croats, many Muslims quickly became dissatisfied with Croatian rule. A Muslim leader reported that not one Muslim occupied an influential post in the administration. Fierce fighting broke out between the Ustaše, Chetniks and Yugoslav Partisans in NDH territory. Some Ustaše militia units became convinced that the Muslims were communist sympathizers, and burned their villages and murdered many civilians. The Chetniks accused the Muslims of {{taking part in the}} Ustaše violence against Serbs and perpetrated similar atrocities against the Muslim population. The Muslims received little protection from the Croatian Home Guard, the regular army of the NDH, whom the Germans described as [...] "of minimal combat value". Local militias were raised, but these were also of limited value and only one, the Tuzla-based Home Guard Hadžiefendić Legion, led by Muhamed Hadžiefendić, was of any significance.|$|E

They included three NCOs from every company of the 13th SS Division, and one cavalry squadron, one battery from each of its artillery battalions, as well as specialist troops. German officers and NCOs were also provided by Waffen-SS replacement units. The divisional area lay along the Franzen Canal, with garrisons in Szenttamás (...) and Kúla (...) and {{on either side of}} the line Zombor-Verbász (...) [...] The 10,000 men for a full-strength division were to be obtained from volunteers, from Muslim conscripts born in 1926 and 1927 (with some exceptions), and if necessary, from the various Muslim militias in the NDH. The conscripts were subjected to the draft by the NDH government then transferred to German command along with the others, who were then transported to Waffen-SS recruiting depots at Zombor and Bošnjaci. These men were to report by 15 September 1944, but in mid-August, Waffen-SS recruiting officer SS Obergruppenführer (Lieutenant General) Gottlob Berger reported to Himmler that there would be insufficient reliable Muslim men available, and Catholic Croats would also have to be accepted into the 23rd SS Division. During Pavelić's visit to Hitler in September 1944, General Đuro Grujić, chief of Pavelić's Military Office, indicated to the Germans that it would be difficult to recruit another 5,000 men to complete the division after 5,000 had already been assigned. Many Volksdeutsche from the NDH and a few from Hungary were recruited into the division to act as interpreters between <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Muslims</b> and the German cadre and to enhance unit cohesion.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the second}} half of the 19th century, stećci are seen as a symbol of Bosnia and Herzegovina, being objects of South Slavic ideological ethno-national {{building}} myths and ownership, as well different opinions on their archaeological, artistic and historical interpretation. Although both Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian nationalism tried to annex them to their own culture, paradoxally, none of the three ethnic groups (Bosniaks, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats) in Bosnia and Herzegovina originally remember them in their collective consciousness, leaving them to nature or human destruction (which at least halved the number), implying the annexation was based on constructions. Specifically, the thesis about the Bogomil origin of the stećci leaned along the theory of Bogomil origin of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Muslims</b> i.e. Bosniaks, which ideologisation and distortion of history was criticized by many scholars, and some like Wenzel stated that [...] "thus stećci were given as a gift to Muslims, emphasizing their inheritance rights to the land and implying that the later Christians, comparatively, were the 'newcomers'". The breakup of Yugoslavia and Bosnian War (1992–1995) caused a resurgence of Bogomil theory in public papers which sought historial-political legitimacy, ideologically aspired that Islamization was not only caused by Ottoman occupation yet it was an event dependent on Bogomils, and thus affirmed ethnical and confessional difference between Bogomil population and population of Catholic and Orthodox confession. However, it did not make a significant influence on scientific thinking and comparative research.|$|E
