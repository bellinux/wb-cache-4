True endomitosis in the anther tapetum of the liliaceous plant Eremurus is described. The nuclear membrane does not disappear, but during metaphase the chromosomes are condensed, often considerably more than in normal mitosis. When the pollen mother cells (PMCs) go through the last premeiotic mitosis, the <b>tapetal</b> cells have one diploid nucleus which divides while the cell remains undivided. The two diploid nuclei may undergo an endomitosis and the resulting tetraploid nuclei a second endomitosis. An alternative pathway is an ordinary mitosis-again without cell division instead {{of one of the}} endomitotic cycles. The cytological picture in the tapetum is further complicated by restitution in anaphase and fusion of metaphase and anaphase groups during mitosis, processes which could give rise to cells with one, two, or three nuclei, instead of the expected two or four. No sign of the so-called [...] "inhibited" [...] mitosis is seen in these <b>tapetal</b> cells. When the PMCs are in leptotene-zygotene, very few <b>tapetal</b> nuclei are in endomitosis.

Degradation of <b>tapetal</b> cells started as early as stage 8 b, at which stage cytological observation showed debris was leaking from tetrads or <b>tapetal</b> cells. Consequently, <b>tapetal</b> cells degraded earlier than in wild type rice, and abnormal development of microspores could already be seen at stage 9 (Luo et al. [2013]; Figure  2).

40|$|In higher plants, timely {{degradation}} of <b>tapetal</b> cells, the innermost sporophytic {{cells of the}} anther wall layer, {{is a prerequisite for}} the development of viable pollen grains. However, relatively {{little is known about the}} mechanism underlying programmed <b>tapetal</b> cell development and degradation. Here, we report a key regulator in monocot rice (Oryza sativa), PERSISTANT <b>TAPETAL</b> CELL 1 (PTC 1), which controls programmed <b>tapetal</b> development and functional pollen formation. The evolutionary significance of PTC 1 was revealed by partial genetic complementation of the homologous mutation MALE STERILITY 1 (MS 1) in the dicot Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). PTC 1 encodes a PHD-finger (for plant homeodomain) protein, which is expressed specifically in <b>tapetal</b> cells and microspores during anther development in stages 8 and 9, when the wild-type <b>tapetal</b> cells initiate a typical apoptosis-like cell death. Even though ptc 1 mutants show phenotypic similarity to ms 1 in a lack of <b>tapetal</b> DNA fragmentation, delayed <b>tapetal</b> degeneration, as well as abnormal pollen wall formation and aborted microspore development, the ptc 1 mutant displays a previously unreported phenotype of uncontrolled <b>tapetal</b> proliferation and subsequent commencement of necrosis-like <b>tapetal</b> death. Microarray analysis indicated that 2, 417 tapetum- and microspore-expressed genes, which are principally associated with <b>tapetal</b> development, degeneration, and pollen wall formation, had changed expression in ptc 1 anthers. Moreover, the regulatory role of PTC 1 in anther development was revealed by comparison with MS 1 and other rice anther developmental regulators. These findings suggest a diversified and conserved switch of PTC 1 /MS 1 in regulating programmed male reproductive development in both dicots and monocots, which provides new insights in plant anther development...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A {{retrospective}} study {{was made to}} demonstrate normal variations of the color {{and size of the}} <b>tapetal</b> area and color of the nontapetal area in the ocular fundus in dogs, correlating them to breed, age and coat color. Methods The study was based on protocols of five hundred and thirty-nine adult dogs describing eye examinations made during the years 1997 - 2001. The dogs were examined using an indirect ophthalmoscope in order to find heritable eye diseases. The following characteristics were recorded: breed; age; coat color; color and size of the <b>tapetal</b> area and color of the nontapetal area. Normal color variations in the fundus were studied and categorized with regard to breed, age and coat color. Chi-square analysis was used comparing distributions between factors. Differences between mean values were analysed with Student's t-test or one-way-ANOVA. A logistic regression analysis was performed on the color of the <b>tapetal</b> area with the color of the coat and breed. Results Twenty breeds were represented. The mean age was 42. 8 months. The most common colors of the <b>tapetal</b> area were yellow-green and orange, and the most common colors of the nontapetal area were dark brown and black. The analysis revealed that coat-color and breed concomitantly did not significantly influence <b>tapetal</b> color. Brown coated dogs often had a striped red and brown nontapetal area. The color of the <b>tapetal</b> area influenced the color of the nontapetal area. Smaller-sized breeds (such as Papillon) had a smaller <b>tapetal</b> area. A <b>tapetal</b> area was completely absent in 1. 9 %. The age did not influence the color of the <b>tapetal</b> area. Conclusions Color of the <b>tapetal</b> area was influenced by both coat color and breed, but neither of these was statistically more influential than the other. The color of the <b>tapetal</b> area influenced the color of the nontapetal area. The size of the <b>tapetal</b> area correlated to breed and to body size. </p...|$|E

40|$|The <b>tapetal</b> {{cells in}} trifoliate orange were studied prior to liberation of pollen grains under light and {{transmission}} electron microscopes. The tapetum was glandular or secretory type {{and consisted of}} two-layered flattened cells immediately below the 2 - 3 layered elongated parietal cells and anther wall. It surrounded the pollen sacs where numerous pollen grains were embedded freely. Many sporopollenin-like granules appeared throughout the <b>tapetal</b> zone releasing from the territory of tapetum and parietal layers. These granules moved through the intercellular spaces and found their ways towards the pollen grains which were finally absorbed by the bacula of grain walls.

30|$|There were 65 {{genes in}} the QTL region, qSTIPSS 9.1, {{including}} transporters, transcription factors such as HSF (OsHsfB 4 c), PHD-finger domain containing TF (PTC 1), bHLH, and C 2 H 2 zinc finger, transcriptional regulators, glycosyltransferase microtubule associated protein, and annexin (Additional file 2 : Table S 1). Tapetum, the innermost cell layer of the anther wall, {{plays a crucial role}} in anther development, microspore/pollen formation, and pollen wall formation. During late pollen development, <b>tapetal</b> degeneration triggered by an apoptosis-like process is essential for viable pollen formation (Li et al. 2006). PERSISTENT <b>TAPETAL</b> CELL 1 (PTC 1) present in the qSTIPSS 9.1 QTL region encodes a PHD-finger protein that controls programmed <b>tapetal</b> development and degradation to ensure functional pollen formation in rice (Li et al. 2011 a, b). PTC 1 is expressed specifically in <b>tapetal</b> cells and microspores during anther development in stages 8 and 9 and initiates a typical apoptosis-like cell death, thereby ensuring proper pollen grain development (Li et al. 2011). Loss of function of PTC 1 displayed uncontrolled <b>tapetal</b> cell proliferation and swelling, delayed DNA fragmentation, and pollen wall development, causing complete male sterility (Li et al. 2011). Timely initiation of <b>tapetal</b> programmed cell death is essential for the regulated release of wall materials from the tapetum to the developing microspore including carbohydrate, lipid molecules, and other nutrients. This gene might be responsible for maintaining higher fertility in N 22 under heat stress by timely initiation of PCD in N 22 <b>tapetal</b> cell to ensure more fertile pollen grains than in the susceptible parent IR 64. This gene otherwise named as a tms 9 – 1 /OsMS 1 is responsible for thermo-sensitive genic male sterility in HengnongS- 1, {{one of the oldest and}} often-used TGMS line in indica two-line hybrid rice breeding programs in China (Qi et al. 2014).

40|$|The {{reflecting}} {{material of}} the tapetum lucidum {{of the sea}} catfish (Arius felis) was chromatographed on Sephadex LH- 20 in methanol–dimethyl sulphoxide–formic acid. Two components were present: one, showing an absorption maximum at 330 nm, was <b>tapetal</b> pigment; the other, at 257 nm, was an associated nucleoside. The <b>tapetal</b> pigment was extracted in methanol–HCl and isolated by adsorption chromatography on Sephadex LH- 20. It yielded a methoxy methyl ester on treatment with diazomethane, and permanganate oxidation gave pyrrole- 2, 3, 5 -tricarboxylic acid. From the information provided by u. v. and i. r. spectra of the pigment and its methoxy methyl ester, from elemental analyses and from the oxidation products, we suggest that the <b>tapetal</b> pigment is derived from oxidative coupling of 5, 6 -dihydroxyindole- 2 -carboxylic acid. A molecular-weight determination and chromatography of the methoxy methyl ester indicate that the pigment {{is a mixture of}} oligomers, among which the tetramers probably predominate. We consider that the monomers are joined mainly by C-C linkages at positions 4 and 7. A synthetic pigment having spectral properties nearly identical with those of the natural pigment was prepared by enzymic oxidation of 5, 6 -dihydroxyindole- 2 -carboxylic acid with mushroom tyrosinase.

To demonstrate that CHA-SQ- 1 -induced male sterility is associated with abnormal <b>tapetal</b> and microspore development, the cytology of CHA-SQ- 1 -treated plant anthers at various developmental stages was studied by light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) assay and DAPI staining. The {{results indicated that the}} SQ- 1 -treated plants underwent premature <b>tapetal</b> programmed cell death (PCD), which was initiated at the early-uninucleate stage of microspore development and continued until the <b>tapetal</b> cells were completely degraded; the process of microspore development was then blocked. Microspores with low-viability (fluorescein diacetate staining) were aborted. The study suggests that premature <b>tapetal</b> PCD is the main cause of pollen abortion.

40|$|B {{chromosomes}} (B's), knobbed chromosomes, and chromosome 6 (NOR) {{of maize}} undergo nondisjunction and micronucleus formation in binucleate <b>tapetal</b> cells. These chromosome instabilities are regular {{events in the}} program of <b>tapetal</b> cell death, but the B's strongly increase A chromosome instability. We studied 1 B and 0 B plants belonging to selected lines for high or low B transmission rate and their F 1 hybrids. These lines are characterized by meiotic conservation or loss of B chromosomes, respectively. The female B transmission (fBtl) allele(s) for low B transmission is dominant, inducing micronucleus formation and B nondisjunction. We hypothesize that the fBtl allele(s) induces knob instability. This instability would be sufficient to produce B loss in both meiocytes and binucleate <b>tapetal</b> cells. B instability could, in turn, produce instabilities in all chromosomes of maize complement. To establish whether the chromosomal instabilities {{are related to the}} <b>tapetal</b> programmed cell death (PCD) process, we applied the TUNEL technique. PCD, estimated as the frequency of binucleate <b>tapetal</b> cells with TUNEL label, was significantly correlated with the formation of micronuclei and the frequency of pollen abortion. It can be concluded that the observed chromosome instabilities are important to the PCD process and to the development of microspores to form viable pollen grains...|$|E
40|$|There are a {{vast number}} of {{transcription}} factors that regulate plant growth and development. The NAC gene superfamily {{is one of the largest}} families of transcription factors in the plant kingdom. NAC gene expression profiles using Affymetrix ATH 1 gene chips were obtained for different plant organs: heart embryo, mature embryo, leaf, root and flower. NAC gene expression profiles proved to be very complex, except for one NAC gene detected only in floral tissue, At 1 g 61110. At 1 g 61110 was shown to be specifically expressed in the anther tapetum of Arabidospis; therefore, its name was changed to TAPNAC. TAPNAC became the focus of our studies. We identified a tapnac T-DNA knockout (KO) line, SALK_ 069450. A molecular phenotype was observed. Several oligopeptide, sugar and metal transporters were differentially expressed. Coincidentally, a wheat NAC gene, named TaNAM-B 1 for its high sequence similarity to ATNAM, TAPNAC and At 3 g 15510 was found to be involved in nutrient remobilization. PHOSPHOLIPASE D? 1 (PLD? 1) was also found to be down-regulated in the tapnac KO. PLD? 1 is an enzyme which hydrolyzes phospholipids that are part of <b>tapetal</b> cell membranes and <b>tapetal</b> lipid bodies. Once these <b>tapetal</b> cell structures are disrupted, the secretion of the compounds that form part of the pollen coat (i. e. proteins, flavonoids and lipids) into the anther locule is facilitated. Promoter deletion analysis using a GUS reporter and later GUS immuno-localization confirmed the findings of Wellmer and others. TAPNAC is a <b>tapetal</b> specific gene. The cis-regulatory sequence that enhances <b>tapetal</b> expression in the TAPNAC promoter was identified. The consensus motif TCGTGT increased <b>tapetal</b> expression of a GUS reporter gene, only when flanked by the TAPNAC minimal promoter region (- 217 bp to + 51 bp). In summary, TAPNAC transcription factor has been characterized and data indicates that it could play a role in nutrient remobilization from the tapetum to the pollen grains, particularly during late floral stages.

40|$|The {{development}} of the <b>tapetal</b> cell surface and associated structures in Avena has been followed from cell formation to senescence. Plasmodesmata initially connect the <b>tapetal</b> cells to each other, the pollen mother cells, and the inner loculus wall cells. These connexions are subsequently severed, those to the sporogenous cells being broken first at the pollen mother cell surface during callose wall formation. Loss of cellulose from the <b>tapetal</b> walls was followed using {{the decline in the}} ability of the wall to bind the fluorescent brightener, Calcofluor White M 2 R New. Subplasma-membrane microtubules persist after loss of the cellulose wall. The <b>tapetal</b> plasma membrane facing the meiocytes then develops a series of depressions, or cups, over its surface, which are later the site of pro-orbicule formation. Sporopollenin is laid down over the pro-orbicules, to form orbicules, and over other <b>tapetal</b> cell surfaces. No morpho-logical evidence was found for the intracytoplasmic formation of pro-orbicules or polymerized sporopollenin precursors. These observations on Avena are compared with those on other plants. The changes in the cell wall and associated structures, plasmodesmata and microtubules, are considered in detail, while the general significance of cell wall loss to the water relations of the tissue are assessed.

40|$|Previously, we {{reported}} that the TAPETUM DETERMINANT 1 (TPD 1) gene is required for specialization of <b>tapetal</b> cells in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) anther. The tpd 1 mutant is phenotypically identical to the excess microsporocytes 1 (ems 1) /extra sporogenous cells (exs) mutant. The TPD 1 and EMS 1 /EXS genes may function in the same developmental pathway in the Arabidopsis anther. Here, we further report that overexpression of TPD 1 alters the cell fates in the Arabidopsis carpel and tapetum. When TPD 1 was expressed ectopically in the wild-type Arabidopsis carpel, the number of cells in the carpel increased significantly, showing that the ectopic expression of TPD 1 protein could activate the cell division in the carpel. Furthermore, the genetic analysis showed that the activation of cell division in the transgenic carpel by TPD 1 was dependent on EMS 1 /EXS, as it did not happen in the ems 1 /exs mutant. This result further suggests that TPD 1 regulates cell fates in coordination with EMS 1 /EXS. Moreover, overexpression of TPD 1 in <b>tapetal</b> cells also delayed the degeneration of tapetum.

30|$|The tapetum plays {{a pivotal}} role in pollen wall {{development}} by secreting sporopollenin precursors onto the pollen surface (Piffanelli et al. 1998; Scott et al. 2004). <b>Tapetal</b> cells accumulate lipidic molecules in sub-organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum-derived tapetosomes and plastid-derived elaioplasts (Liu and Fan 2013). In plants such as Arabidopsis, these sub-organelles are released upon degradation of the tapetum, and their contents are deposited to the pollen surface (Hsieh and Huang 2005). In rice and other Poaceae plants, the <b>tapetal</b> cells form Ubisch body, a specialized structure located on the inner side of the tapetum, that carries sporopollenin precursors to the developing microspores (Shi et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2016). Nonetheless, degradation of tapetum is still crucially important for pollen wall formation in rice. Premature or delayed <b>tapetal</b> degeneration usually results in abnormal pollen development and male sterility (Liu and Fan 2013; Shi et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2016). Transcription factors reported to be associated with <b>tapetal</b> function and degeneration, such as DYSFUNCTIONAL TAPETUM 1 (DYT 1) (Zhang et al. 2006), DEFECTIVE in <b>TAPETAL</b> DEVELOPMENT and FUNCTION 1 (TDF 1) (Zhu et al. 2008), ABORTED MICROSPORES (AMS) (Sorensen et al. 2003) and AtMYB 103 /MS 188 (Higginson et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2007) in Arabidopsis, as well as GAMYB (Aya et al. 2009), TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION (TDR) (Li et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2008) and ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 (EAT 1) (Ji et al. 2013; Niu et al. 2013 b) in rice, regulate pollen wall related-genes directly or indirectly. Mutants of these genes have defective tapetum development and pollen exine formation.|$|E
40|$|Stages in the {{formation}} and degradation of pollenkitt in the anther of Lilium have been investigated using the electron microscope. This material, {{which appears to be}} a complex of lipid and carotenoids, is formed during the autolysis of the <b>tapetal</b> cells by the fusion of lipidic inclusions with globules derived from plastids. Autolysis of the <b>tapetal</b> cells is progressive for it commences with the disintegration of many cytoplasmic components, followed by the breakdown of storage lipids. The plasma membrane maintains its integrity during these events apparently, by proliferation, aiding in the transfer of the products of hydrolysis into the loculus. During the course of lipid breakdown, a striking vacuolar system is formed in the <b>tapetal</b> cytoplasm, presumably containing the products of this hydrolysis. The source of membranes for this system is clearly the lipid globules themselves. The generation of the membrane apparently involves the participation of electronopaque material, possibly enzymic, contained within the lipid globules...|$|E
40|$|In {{flowering}} plants, pollen formation {{depends on}} the differentiation and interaction of two cell types in the anther: the reproductive cells, called microsporocytes, and somatic cells that form the tapetum. The microsporocytes generate microspores, whereas the <b>tapetal</b> cells support the development of microspores into mature pollen grains. Despite their importance to plant reproduction, {{little is known about}} the underlying genetic mechanisms that regulate the differentiation and interaction of these highly specialized cells in the anther. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a novel TAPETUM DETERMINANT 1 (TPD 1) gene that is required for the specialization of <b>tapetal</b> cells in the Arabidopsis anther. Analysis of the male-sterile mutant, tpd 1, showed that functional interruption of TPD 1 caused the precursors of <b>tapetal</b> cells to differentiate and develop into microsporocytes instead of tapetum. As a results, extra microsporocytes were formed and tapetum was absent in developing tpd 1 anthers. Molecular cloning of TPD 1 revealed that it encodes a small protein of 176 amino acids. In addition, tpd 1 was phenotypically similar to excess microsporocytes 1 /extra sporogenous cells (ems 1 /exs) single and tpd 1 ems 1 /exs double mutants. These data suggest that the TPD 1 product plays an important role in the differentiation of <b>tapetal</b> cells, possibly in coordination with the EMS 1 /EXS gene product, a Leu-rich repeat receptor protein kinase...|$|E
