5000|$|When <b>the</b> <b>official</b> <b>report</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sinking was {{released}} on 20 May there was widespread international condemnation of the North's actions.

500|$|Darkening of {{the skin}} is also caused by decomposition. The staking of a swollen, decomposing body could cause the body to bleed and force the {{accumulated}} gases to escape the body.

One reason for this oversight is that many soldiers of the 2nd US Colored Light Artillery were reported {{to be members of}} the 6th US Colored Heavy Artillery.|$|R

On 26 December 2011, <b>the</b> <b>official</b> newspaper Rodong Sinmun hailed him as supreme leader of the party and the state. On 30 December, a meeting of the Politburo officially appointed him Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, after he was allegedly nominated for the position by Kim Jong-il himself in October 2011 (the anniversary of Kim Jong-il's assumption of general-secretaryship).|$|R

A sociologist and professor who published an investigation into the attack believes the MTP had wider aims: [...] "They weren’t planning to put down a coup. They were creating the false image of a coup, to set the scene, but were planning to take the barracks and from there start a revolution." ...|$|R

50|$|After {{studying}} the notes, Grant {{believed that it}} was actually a letter written by Cobain announcing his intent to leave Courtney Love, Seattle, and the music business. Grant asserts that the lines at the very bottom of the note, separate from the rest, are the only parts implying suicide. While <b>the</b> <b>official</b> <b>report</b> <b>on</b> Cobain's death concluded that Cobain wrote the note, Grant claims that <b>the</b> <b>official</b> <b>report</b> does not distinguish these lines {{from the rest of the}} note and simply draws the conclusion across its entirety. However, it should be noted that many of Kurt's notes were written in this manner. This was discovered when Cobain's Journals were published in 2002.|$|R

50|$|This {{reported}} UFO sighting {{occurred over}} the Canary Islands on 22 June 1976. It is notable for its duration (over 40 minutes), multiple locations (it was observed in Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera, Gran Canaria and by a ship at sea) and multiple witnesses (several hundred people, including both civilian and military personnel). It {{is one of the}} few accounts to include a report of details of the occupants inside <b>the</b> craft. <b>The</b> <b>official</b> <b>report</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> incident, by the Spanish Air Force, was declassified in June 1994, but much of its content had already been released to the public in 1977, after journalist J Benitez obtained a number of military files and used them as the basis of a book on UFO cases.|$|R

The report also details 50,000 Jews killed in Bogdanovka, and tens of thousands more in Golta and the surrounding areas. The Jewish Virtual Library cites figures of 34,000 Jews murdered during October 22-25, and the US Holocaust Museum concludes that [...] "Romanian and German forces killed almost 100,000 Jews in Odessa during the occupation of the city." [...] In other sources the number of people killed in Transnistria was 115,000 Jews and 15,000 Romani.|$|R
30|$|The {{fact that}} forms of {{absolute}} poverty are neglected in Europe deepens the deprivation of relevant futures {{of the people}} involved. Academic and social statistical poverty research {{has a responsibility to}} be concerned with “relevant futures”. This requires an understanding of neglected futures on a meta-level. By understanding neglected futures, academic and political discourse can contribute, e.g., also in cooperation with pressure groups, to resistance to restriction and a fight for the freedoms to choose relevant futures – future lives people have reasons to value. Some of <b>the</b> <b>official</b> <b>reports</b> <b>on</b> poverty and wealth that emerged in Germany during the 1990 s serve as an illustrative example, as they are the result of the joint efforts of welfare organizations, communities and devoted academics [35]. These joint efforts are expressions of “concerns about relevant futures”.|$|R

50|$|Ader's {{progress}} {{attracted the}} interest of the minister of war, Charles de Freycinet. With the backing of the French War Office, Ader developed and constructed the Avion III. It resembled an enormous bat made of linen and wood, with a 48 ft wingspan, equipped with two four bladed tractor propellers, each powered by a steam engine of 30 hp (22 kW). Using a circular track at Satory, Ader carried out taxiing trials on 12 October 1897 and two days later attempted a flight. After a short run the machine was caught by a gust of wind, slewed off the track, and came to a stop. After this the French army withdrew its funding, but kept the results secret. The commission released in November 1910 <b>the</b> <b>official</b> <b>reports</b> <b>on</b> Ader's attempted flights, stating that they were unsuccessful.|$|R
