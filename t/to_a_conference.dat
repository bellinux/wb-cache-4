5|$|An initial {{meeting on}} May 30 nearly ended in disaster. Waite and several local civic leaders called union {{president}} Calderwood and mine owners Hagerman and Moffat <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> {{in a meeting}} hall {{on the campus of}} Colorado College in Colorado Springs. Talks were under way and proceeding well when a mob of local citizens attempted to storm the building. Blaming Calderwood and Waite for the violence in Cripple Creek, they intended to lynch both men. As a local judge distracted the mob, Calderwood and Waite escaped out a rear door and onto the governor's waiting train.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Tanev (born December 20, 1989) is a Canadian {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} defenceman {{who is an}} alternate captain for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL). Unselected in the NHL Entry Draft, he was signed by the Canucks {{as a free agent}} after his freshman year with the Rochester Institute of Technology Tigers.

5|$|Desha {{gradually}} became more conservative {{after his return}} to the House, consistently resisting expansion of the U.S. Navy. He also opposed Secretary of War James Monroe's request to maintain a standing peacetime army of 20,000 men. Desha argued that a large standing army provided the advocates of a larger federal government with an excuse to increase taxes, and proposed that the standing army should consist of only 6,000 men. A coalition of Federalists and conservative Democratic-Republicans in the House united to adopt Desha's suggestion by a vote of 7565. The version of the bill passed by the Senate, however, required a standing army of 15,000 men. The legislation was referred <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> committee, which ultimately adopted a compromise of 10,000 men.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Walton was {{presented}} with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work {{came to a halt}} in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year.|$|E
5|$|Jim Tatum {{was hired}} in 1947, after a brief stint at Oklahoma where he had led the Sooners <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> {{championship}} in his only season there. He was Maryland's sixth head coach in eight years, but Tatum stayed for nine seasons and became the school's most successful head coach in modern history. During his tenure, he led Maryland to two national championships (one retroactive), three conference championships, three perfect seasons, six top-20 final rankings, and five bowl game appearances. Seven of his players were named first-team All-Americans, including five consensus All-Americans. Under Tatum, Maryland finished every season with a winning record.|$|E

5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World is a non-fiction {{compilation}} {{book about}} targeted killing edited by Claire Finkelstein, Jens David Ohlin, and Andrew Altman. It {{was published by}} Oxford University Press in 2012. The book grew out of contributions by the authors <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> in April 2011 at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Targeted Killings features eighteen essays in five sections arranged by topic. The work argues that after the 11 September attacks by Al-Qaeda in 2001, the United States and other countries {{began to see the}} tactic of targeted killing differently. The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of self-defence in military settings; after 11 September 2001 it was used to kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.|$|E
5|$|The first {{high level}} {{negotiation}} between the British and the Zionists can be dated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> on 7 February 1917 that included Sir Mark Sykes and the Zionist leadership. Subsequent discussions led to Balfour's request, on 19 June, that Rothschild and Chaim Weizmann submit {{a draft of}} a public declaration. Further drafts were discussed by the British Cabinet during September and October, with input from Zionist and anti-Zionist Jews but with no representation from the local population in Palestine. The release of the final declaration was authorised by 31 October; the preceding Cabinet discussion had referenced perceived propaganda benefits amongst the worldwide Jewish community for the Allied war effort.|$|E
5|$|At {{the moment}} of impact, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was in his office {{on the other side}} of the Pentagon, away from the crash site. He ran to the site and {{assisted}} the injured. Rumsfeld returned to his office, and went <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials. On the day of the attacks, DoD officials considered moving their command operations to Site R, a backup facility in Pennsylvania. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, and sent Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Site R. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) continued to operate at the Pentagon, even as smoke entered the facility. Engineers and building managers manipulated the ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC and bring in fresh air.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 28 June, a battle group of the 1st SS Panzer Division, Kampfgruppe Frey, arrived at the front and was placed under the command of the 12th SS Panzer Division. At 0810, General Friedrich Dollmann, the 7th Army commander, ordered SS-Obergruppenführer Paul Hausser to divert the II SS Panzer Corps, to {{counter-attack}} south of Cheux. Hausser replied that no counter-attack could be launched until the following day, as so many of his units had yet to reach the front. The German command was thrown into disarray by Dollmann's sudden death, when Rommel and Gerd von Rundstedt (OB West) were en route <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> with Hitler and {{out of touch with the}} situation. It was not until 1500 that Hausser was appointed commander of the 7th Army, with Willi Bittrich replacing him as commander of II SS Panzer Corps. (Hausser was advised to retain control of the Corps until the following morning.) Pending the return of Rommel to Normandy, Hausser was also to be supreme commander in the invasion area. At 1700 the command structure was changed again; the 7th Army under Hausser would be responsible for the invasion front facing the American army, while the Panzer Group West (General Geyr von Schweppenburg) was to be responsible for the invasion front facing the Anglo-Canadian forces.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{states had}} already seceded when Breckinridge took his seat as a senator, leaving the {{remaining}} Southern senators more outnumbered in their defense of slavery. Seeking {{to find a}} compromise that would reunite the states under constitutional principles, he urged Lincoln to withdraw federal forces from the Confederate states in order to avert war. The congressional session ended on March 28, and in an April 2 address to the Kentucky General Assembly, he continued to advocate peaceful reconciliation of the states and proposed a conference of border states to seek a solution. On April 12, Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter, ending plans for the conference. Breckinridge recommended that Governor Beriah Magoffin call a sovereignty convention to determine whether Kentucky would side with the Union or the Confederacy. On May 10, he was chosen by the legislature as one of six delegates <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> to decide the state's next action. The states' rights delegates were Breckinridge, Magoffin, and Richard Hawes; the Unionist delegates were Crittenden, Archibald Dixon, and S.S. Nicholas. Unable to agree on substantial issues, the delegates recommended that Kentucky adopt a neutral stance in the Civil War and arm itself to prevent invasion by either federal or Confederate forces. Breckinridge did not support this recommendation, but he agreed to abide by it once it {{was approved by the}} legislature.|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} of Joseph as coach {{coincided with the}} expansion of the competition from 14 teams to 15 teams. The expanded competition was renamed Super Rugby, and converted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> system with three conferences of five teams — Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The Highlanders now had to play each other New Zealand team twice, and four teams each from the Australian and South African conferences — 16 matches in total over the regular season. Joseph's rein as coach started with a win over the Hurricanes in Wellington, followed by a win over the Chiefs in Dunedin, and a win over the Bulls in Pretoria. The team then suffered their first loss of the season to the Stormers in Cape Town, followed by a loss to the Crusaders in Dunedin. The Highlanders then won their next four matches; their last a 26–18 victory over the Crusaders in Nelson. The Highlanders then lost all but one of their remaining matches of the season to finish with eight wins and eight losses in total. This left them eighth out of fifteen teams on the table, and third in the New Zealand conference.|$|E

However, she explains to her mother (Reema Lagoo) that she does not really love him and is marrying him as a compromise as she feels she can never love again after losing Rahul. Aman also suspects that she does not really love him. Determined to reunite her father and his best friend, Anjali Khanna and her grandmother search for Anjali Sharma and soon learn that {{she is going to be}} working at a summer camp in Shimla. Rahul tells his daughter that she is not allowed to attend the summer camp and heads <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference,</b> only to find out that his mom and daughter went without telling him, having left a letter for him. They travel to the camp, with a plan to later lure Rahul to come as well, and the two Anjalis meet each other. One night while watching television, Anjali Sharma realizes she has met Rahul's daughter, and that Tina is dead. Rahul soon arrives at Camp Sunshine, after his daughter fakes a fever, where he and Anjali Sharma are surprised and delighted to see each other again, sharing a sweet reunion. Throughout the days spent at the camp, Rahul and Anjali feel themselves falling in love. Just as they are about to share a heated moment, Anjali thinks about her upcoming engagement and feels guilty. She runs away in tears, after which Aman arrives and tells Rahul that he is Anjali's fiancee. Rahul is heartbroken but congratulates Anjali.
