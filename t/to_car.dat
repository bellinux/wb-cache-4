5|$|In 1852, James Alexander Holden {{emigrated to}} South Australia from Walsall, England and in 1856 {{established}} J.A. Holden & Co, a saddlery business in Adelaide. In 1885, German-born H. A. Frost joined the {{business as a}} junior partner and J.A. Holden & Co became Holden & Frost Ltd. Edward Holden, James' grandson, joined the firm in 1905 {{with an interest in}} automobiles. From there, the firm evolved through various partnerships and, in 1908, Holden & Frost moved into the business of minor repairs <b>to</b> <b>car</b> upholstery. The company began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies in 1913, and Edward experimented with fitting bodies to different types of carriages. After 1917, wartime trade restrictions led the company to start full-scale production of vehicle body shells. J.A. Holden founded a new company in 1919, Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd (HMBB) specialising in car bodies and using a facility on King William Street in Adelaide.|$|E
5|$|Lexus {{production}} models are named alphanumerically using two-letter designations followed by three digits. The first letter indicates relative {{status in the}} Lexus model range (ranking), and the second letter refers <b>to</b> <b>car</b> body style or type (e.g. LS for 'luxury sedan'). The three digits indicate engine displacement in liters multiplied {{by a factor of}} one hundred (e.g. 350 for a 3.5 L engine). A space is used between the letters and numbers. The same letter may be used differently depending on the model; 'S' can refer to 'sedan' or 'sport' (e.g. in LS and SC), while 'X' refers to 'luxury utility vehicle' or SUV. On hybrids, the three digits refer to the combined gasoline-electric output. For certain models, a lower case letter placed after the alphanumeric designation indicates powerplant type ('h' for hybrid, 'd' for diesel, 't' for turbocharged), while capital letter(s) placed at the end indicates a class subtype (e.g. 'L' for long-wheelbase, 'C' for coupe, 'AWD' for all-wheel drive). On F marque models, the two-letter designation and the letter 'F' are used with no numbers or hyphens (e.g. IS F).|$|E
40|$|This article aims to {{supplement}} scarce {{research on the}} children's attitudes <b>to</b> <b>cars</b> and the environment. Assuming that attitudes <b>to</b> <b>cars</b> develop in childhood, this article draws upon the writing assignments and interviews exploring the upper-elementary school children's attitudes <b>to</b> <b>cars.</b> The {{study was conducted in}} Amsterdam, The Netherlands, between January and December 2010. Briefly examining existing research on children's environmental attitudes in general, and in relation <b>to</b> <b>cars</b> in particular, the author argues that in-depth qualitative research is essential {{to the understanding of the}} factors that explain present attitudes and perhaps predicting the behavior of the future users of the means of transportation. In conclusion, the author makes a recommendation for the development of a curriculum addressing the development of children's awareness of sustainable transportation.

5|$|The area {{is now one}} of {{the most}} ethnically and {{economically}} diverse in Louisville. Crime is becoming less of a problem. While in 2003 there were 11.5 crimes per 1,000 residents, over twice the average for the city of Louisville as a whole, which was 5.0 crimes per 1,000 residents Old Louisville now has a similar number of calls for police assistance as other parts of Louisville.
