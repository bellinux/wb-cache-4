5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may also help calm <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E
5|$|In {{patients}} of normal intelligence, rumination {{is not an}} intentional behavior and is habitually reversed using diaphragmatic breathing to counter <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> regurgitate. Alongside reassurance, explanation and habit reversal, patients are shown how to breathe using their diaphragms prior to and during the normal rumination period. A similar breathing pattern {{can be used to}} prevent normal vomiting. Breathing in this method works by physically preventing the abdominal contractions required to expel stomach contents.|$|E
5|$|Blackouts in {{freediving}} {{can occur}} when the breath is held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue {{towards the end of}} the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.|$|E

5|$|After his {{two and a}} {{half years}} of training, Naruto returns to Konoha and begins to deal more {{actively}} with the Akatsuki threat by saving Gaara from their clutches. To fight them, Naruto trains with Kakashi to infuse the Rasengan with his own wind-element chakra, creating the Rasen-Shuriken attack that proves instrumental in the downfall of the Akatsuki member Kakuzu. Despite being targeted by the Akatsuki, Naruto dedicates himself to finding and retrieving Sasuke; he eventually disposes of Orochimaru and starts acting on his vengeance-driven whims. Over time, though resisting <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> use the creature's power, the Nine Tails's influence over him expands to the point where he begins to lose his rationality as more chakra manifests in the form of tails to the point the Tailed Beast can take control of his body. This ultimately causes him to go on a rampage, destroying everything in his path.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> {{identify}} scapegoats {{for the fire}} is {{the acceptance of the}} confession of a simple-minded French watchmaker named Robert Hubert, who claimed that he was an agent of the Pope and had started the Great Fire in Westminster. He later changed his story to say that he had started the fire at the bakery in Pudding Lane. Hubert was convicted, despite some misgivings about his fitness to plead, and hanged at Tyburn on 28 September 1666. After his death, it became apparent that he had been on board a ship in the North Sea, and had not arrived in London until two days after the fire started. These allegations that Catholics had started the fire were exploited as powerful political propaganda by opponents of pro-Catholic Charles II's court, mostly during the Popish Plot and the exclusion crisis later in his reign.|$|E

5|$|Capcom's design {{philosophy}} for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was {{to maximize}} gameplay depth and minimize complexity. According to Niitsuma, the development team sought {{to create a}} game that would reach out to longtime fans of the series, while simultaneously expanding their user base to those familiar with the characters, but perhaps not with fighting games in general. <b>The</b> <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> reach out to new players also stemmed from Marvel's recent success in the Hollywood film industry. Capcom's global head of production, Keiji Inafune, expressed interest in appealing to a worldwide audience. These ideas drove the decision to retool the fighting system, which was criticized in past iterations for being too complicated for casual players. These changes include {{the implementation of the}} three-button attack system from Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and the addition of Simple Mode. Unlike previous titles in the series, Capcom had no plans for an arcade release, and focused only on console versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. When asked if Capcom was planning to release the game on other consoles, Niitsuma did not dismiss the possibility for a Nintendo Wii version; however, this ultimately did not come to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. The mother will {{pay close attention to}} the needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though {{studies have shown that the}} mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have the proper scent. The mother will also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E
5|$|In April 1939 Britten and Pears {{sailed to}} North America, going first to Canada {{and then to}} New York. They had several reasons for leaving England, {{including}} the difficult position of pacifists in an increasingly bellicose Europe; the success that Frank Bridge had enjoyed in the US; the departure of Auden and his friend Christopher Isherwood to the US from England three months previously; hostile or belittling reviews of Britten's music in the English press; and under-rehearsed and inadequate performances. Britten and Pears consummated their relationship and from then until Britten's death they were partners in both their professional and personal lives. When the Second World War began, Britten and Pears turned for advice to the British embassy in Washington and {{were told that they}} should remain in the US as artistic ambassadors. Pears was inclined to disregard the advice and go back to England; Britten also felt <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> return, but accepted the embassy's counsel and persuaded Pears to do the same.|$|E

However, he is caught by Sam, who thinks he's stealing from their mother. While Dean at first pretends that he needs the knife to repay a gambling debt, he eventually reveals the truth. Although Sam does not believe him, he accompanies his brother to the djinn's warehouse lair. There Dean discovers that the young woman he has been having visions of {{is a victim of}} the djinn. It's clear that she is alive but in an hallucinatory statea way for the djinn to keep its victims unresisting while it feedsDean realizes that he, too, is within an illusory world.

Sam, who is already in the warehouse trying to rescue him, is attacked by the djinn, but Dean kills the creature.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{travelled}} {{to flight}} schools across America. In November {{he flew to}} Orlando, Florida and across to Galveston, Texas near Palm Beach. The lecturing tour took him to Los Angeles California {{at the end of}} 1942. By January 1943 he had also visited Arizona and Texas. His flight log had expanded throughout this period to include a variety of types. Using his privileged position he flew the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Lockheed P-38 Lightning and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. Through flying MacLachlan felt <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> participate in combat operations again but he enjoyed American hospitality immensely. In February he flew at an aerobatic show in Mesa, Arizona. On 18 February 1943 MacLachlan had a close call. While flying from Fort Stockton to El Paso, he force-landed in the desert when he ran out of fuel. According to a legend, MacLachaln used a local pipeline to fill the tanks. While in America he undertook several public relations tours and met movie stars such as Orson Wells and Joan Fontaine when he visited Hollywood for autographed photo-shoots.|$|E
5|$|There is a migratory {{divide in}} Europe at {{longitude}} 10–11°E. Birds {{to the west}} of this line head southwest towards Iberia or West Africa, whereas populations to the east migrate to the eastern Mediterranean and on to East Africa. Cross-breeding in captivity of birds from the resident population on the Canary Islands with migratory blackcaps from Germany showed <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> migrate is genetically controlled, the offspring showing intermediate behaviour in terms of restlessness at migration time. Similar experiments using birds from southern Germany and eastern Austria, {{on opposite sides of the}} migratory divide, demonstrated that the direction of migration is also genetically determined. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.|$|E

5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E
