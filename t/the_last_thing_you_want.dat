500|$|Upon its release, Post {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Lorraine Ali of Rolling Stone praised the album for providing a [...] "much-needed escape route" [...] from the alternative rock offerings {{of the early}} 1990s, and for successfully merging disparate styles. She concluded: [...] "When Post comes to an end, it feels like getting back from a good vacation: <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do is re-enter the real world". Comparing it to Björk's previous studio album Debut, Slant Magazines Eric Henderson felt Post [...] "upped the ante by plugging listeners into the diverse pop mixtape playing inside her mind". In the end, he argued that it [...] "will likely always remain the Björk album that most successfully sustains her winning balance of experimental whimsy and solid pop magic". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Jim Farber stated that despite Posts [...] "bizarre" [...] combination of diverse genres, the conviction of Björk's delivery and assuring hooks [...] " [...] her most surreal passages as relatable as moon-June standards". Ultimately, {{he felt that the}} singer [...] " [...] that tradition, constructing standards for the cyber age".|$|E

[...] "But I'll tell you what: the old man can't expect it of everybody. If he keeps this thing up much longer, it's going to be talked about. You can't have a woman walking into your place of business, and trying to bulldoze you before your porter, without setting your porter to thinking. And <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> a porter to do is to think; for when a porter thinks, he thinks wrong." ...|$|E

But there are also times when it becomes a real intrusion into your life.

Lowe wrote the album while he was undergoing treatment for cancer in hospital. Lowe explained that [...] "When you are wired up to chemo and radio therapy, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do is wallow in it and feel sorry for yourself so I had the idea that the album should be happy and not too dark." ...|$|E

5000|$|During the game's prime, Mythic {{operated}} 120 dual-processor Pentium servers running Linux.

The servers were designed to handle 20,000 players simultaneously logged in at any given time, however, Mythic limited them to about 4,000 each {{in order to keep}} the world from feeling too cluttered. Mythic's cofounder Rob Denton stated, [...] "If you have too many people, the worlds get too crowded. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> is to be bumping into thousands of people." [...] Much of the game's code was also stored on the servers, with the user client more focused on graphics and texture loading based on a data stream limited to 10 kbit/s per player.|$|E
5000|$|It wasn’t at all planned {{from the}} {{beginning}} that I would make two films with Jean-Claude Van Damme back-to-back. I was approached to do Timecop, and I loved the auspices. (Producer) Larry Gordon was involved with it; Moshe Diamant was a terrific producer; Sam Raimi was involved... It was a really clever story, and I thought it was a chance to make the best movie Van Damme ever made. I said yes and we made it, and it was clear {{that it was going to}} be a hit because it previewed through the roof every time. It’s still his biggest hit. So Universal and Moshe Diamant wanted to team us again as soon as possible, so they put Sudden Death together. There was never any question that we would just do Timecop 2.

I haven't seen the replay (until now). don't know what happened. The right-front popped and I took a hard left. I hope Aric is alright. That's <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to see is a big hit like that for anyone. It came out of nowhere. Everything was fine and I just took a hard one.

5000|$|In 2008 it was {{revealed}} that the Maryland State Police had included 53 names of non-violent protesters in several databases that track suspected terrorists, despite the lack of any evidence of crimes being committed. This action was taken under authorization from Mr. Hutchins who at the time was serving as the state police superintendent. During testimony before the Maryland Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, in which he voluntarily testified on the record, he stated [...] "if it happened during my tenor then I am ultimately responsible"; he apologized for the actions that had been taken by certain members of the department stating that those names should not have been entered into that data base. He further stated on the record, that one of those named did in fact raise concerns for violence due to past actions and statements and {{went on to say that}} [...] "sometimes advocacy groups can have one or more fringe people who have their own agenda" [...] meaning they attach themselves to the group.

Earnhardt told reporters after the race that Johnson [...] "said he didn’t see us.

But we've all had those moments, especially on waking, when you think 'Was that real, was that a dream?'. Doctor Who plays with levels of reality and alternative universes, and the dream world is an alternative universe of sorts and all the more interesting for being a distortion or embellishment of our own waking lives. And The Doctor, being so mercurial and full of thoughts and intelligence, his dream life is particularly interesting and rich. He's particularly freaked out {{by the idea that}} he should sleep at all - he sort of denies that that's the sort of thing he does - he's got too much to do and he's too wired. He's unnerved by the idea of dreaming himself." [...] Simon Nye [...] "Amy's Choice" [...] was written by Simon Nye, who is known for writing the sitcom Men Behaving Badly.

Nye admitted to restraining himself in the change from comedy to science fiction, but said it was [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "hugely liberating". Showrunner Steven Moffat originally gave Nye the premise of the episode for it to fit in the series arc, which was to challenge the Doctor and Amy's relationship. Nye states that Rory's [...] "death" [...] scene is essentially where Amy realises her feelings for Rory. Nye wanted to prove that Amy really loved Rory, and he was [...] "not just a cypher boyfriend or fiancé".|$|E

So we draw diagrams: sometimes ad hoc, sometimes using a recog-nised notation (like UML[2], Coad-Yourdon, use-cases, flowcharts, or many others). The great power of these pictures is their ability to expose the important things you really want to say about the soft-ware (or indeed, about hardware or business processes) while get-ting rid of the clutter of fine detail — which you are forced into if you write program code.
