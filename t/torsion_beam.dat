25|$|According to GM's global product {{development}} chief Mark Reuss, the North America version Cruze is modified {{from the global}} platform as it requires reinforcements to the engine compartment because it offers a bigger engine than in other markets and uses <b>torsion</b> <b>beam</b> suspension.|$|E
25|$|According to GM, the Cruze's body {{structure}} is 65percent high-strength steel. MacPherson struts are utilized {{in the front}} suspension with a solid <b>torsion</b> <b>beam</b> axle for the rear, avoiding the cost and complexity needed for a modern multi-link independent rear suspension used by some more expensive rivals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. RC beams as a {{structural}} member contain {{a variety of}} non-uniform loads. These non-uniform loads caused combined effects of flexure and torsion. There are numerous studies available, that suggests different strengthening schemes using FRP laminates, as a solution for flexure and <b>torsion</b> deficient <b>beams.</b> Most of the experimental studies suggested individual strengthening schemes for flexure or torsional deficiency RC beams. However, the combined effects were not studied due to difference in experimental setup, testing procedure and specimen detailing. Therefore, the outcome of previous studies was needed to combine together to facilitate the strengthening process as a guideline case of such deficiency. Therefore, a combined review is presented by suggesting different configuration for flexure and <b>torsion</b> deficient RC <b>beams.</b> Most of the studies suggested that the application of FRP laminates at the soffit of beam is suitable for flexural strengthening. The application of U-shape or full wrap are suitable for strengthen <b>torsion</b> deficient <b>beams.</b> Similarly, 45 ° wraps are more effective than 90 °wraps for improving ductility of <b>torsion</b> deficient <b>beams...</b>|$|R

25|$|Vista V50 is {{significant}} because it's {{one of the first}} fruits of Toyota's company-wide platform renewal efforts known as the MC. Studies for new front-wheel drive (FWD) platform and packaging layout began in 1993 and appeared on market in February 1997 in the Toyota Prius, but the Vista is the first mass-production, FWD Toyota with a new platform. Toyota claims this is the first true redesign and re-think of its FWD platforms since the 1982 Camry/Vista. With this platform, Toyota trades rear MacPherson Struts for a <b>torsion</b> <b>beam</b> axle setup. A double-wishbone setup is available for all-wheel drive. Toyota also flipped the engine orientation so that the intake manifold is in front, improving space efficiency.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1958, Kartsev {{decided to}} {{modernize}} the Ob'yekt 140 turret. He fitted it with a cartridge-case ejector and mounted it onto a stretched T-55 chassis with a new suspension. He also considered that designs based on already produced vehicles had a higher chance of acceptance. The Ob'yekt 140 turret diameter, bigger than the T-55 turret by 249 mm, made redesigning {{the central part of}} the hull necessary. Kartsev changed the arrangement of the <b>torsion</b> <b>beams,</b> which was necessary to keep the tank's weight balanced. The tank received the designation [...] "Ob'yekt 165" [...] and in November 1958 three prototypes were built. In January 1962, the Ob'yekt 165 was accepted for service under the name T-62A. In the same year, Factory #183 produced five tanks that were put into experimental service.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis and}} preliminary design, fabrication, and measurement for mechanical vibration-isolation platforms especially designed for resonating MEMS devices including gyroscopes. Important parameters for designing isolation platforms are specified and the first platform (in designs with cascaded multiple platforms) is crucial for improving vibration-isolation performance and minimizing side-effects on integrated gyroscopes. This isolation platform, made from a thick silicon wafer substrate for an environment-resistant MEMS package, incorporates the functionalities of a previous design including vacuum packaging and thermal resistance with no additional resources. This platform consists of platform mass, isolation beams, vertical feedthroughs, and bonding pads. Two isolation platform designs follow from two isolation beam designs: lateral clamped–clamped <b>beams</b> and vertical <b>torsion</b> <b>beams.</b> The beams function simultaneously as mechanical springs and electrical interconnects. The vibration-isolation platform can yield a multi-dimensional, high-order mechanical low pass filter. The isolation platform possesses eight interconnects within a 12. 2 _ 12. 2 mm 2 footprint. The contact resistance ranges from 4 – 11 Ω depending on the beam design. Vibration measurements using a laser-Doppler vibrometer demonstrate that the lateral vibration-isolation platform suppresses external vibration having frequencies exceeding 2. 1 kHz...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of reinforced concrete <b>beams</b> under pure <b>torsion</b> was studied. Six reinforced concrete beams were designed with stirrup spacing {{as the principal}} variable and tested under monotonic loading up to failure. Loads, angles of twist and reinforcing steel strains were recorded. Based on the experimental results, methods to predict {{the response of the}} beams were examined and an equation for torsional capacity was proposed. Three of the predamaged beams were repaired by adding external steel bands bonded to concrete which was proved to be a very practical and efficient way for retrofitting damaged <b>torsion</b> <b>beams.</b> Experimental data on strength, stiffness, steel strain of the repaired beams were obtained, and comparisons between the repaired and the unrepaired control beams were made.

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{implementation}} of a virtual laboratory, using Matlab program, for the analysis of the uniform <b>torsion</b> in <b>beams,</b> topic studied during the first courses of Engineering. This software makes it possible to visualize the physical phenomenon and achieve optimal solutions with little effort and using the finite difference method and finite element method. Additionally, the use of Galerkin’s Method as an approximation to the integral formulation is related to the contents of Mathematic courses so it serves as a transition to the higher grades of finite elements method in which the variational formulation of the method is studied in depth. As a consequence, this phenomena, which students traditionally study by applying different mathematical techniques, such us, finite difference method or finite element method, can also be solve with this Mathlab virtual laboratory.

40|$|As in the {{classical}} theory the warping function doesn't punctually satisfy the first indefinite equilibrium equation, the principal aim of this work {{is to develop a}} new thory for non-uniform <b>torsion</b> of <b>beams</b> with axial symmetric cross-section, fully restrained on both ends and loaded by a constant torque, that permits to punctually satisfy the previous equation, by means of a trigonometric expansion of the axial displacement and unit twist angle functions...|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} design {{equations}} available for calculating the torsional compliance and maximum torsion stress of a rectangular cross-section beam. However, before using these equations, {{one of the}} two dimensions (i.e., the thickness and the width) of the cross-section must be defined as the wider of the two dimensions [17]. This situation might be troublesome and error-prone during the design phase because we always do not know which dimension is larger in advance. This is especially true for an optimization design process considering that the two dimensions of the <b>torsion</b> <b>beam(s)</b> may change greatly during the design iteration process including the relative size of the two dimensions. In our previous work [17], general compliance equations that are symmetric with respect to the two dimensions were obtained to facilitate the design of torsional beams in compliant mechanisms. These equations had been used in characterizing parasitic motions of compliant mechanisms [18, 19] and spatial deflections modeling [20 – 22]. However, there still lacks an equation for predicting the maximum stress in torsional beams that is symmetric with respect to the two dimensions.|$|R

2500|$|At a {{media event}} on February 28, 2011, Holden {{unveiled}} the Australian assembled Cruze sedan in facelifted [...] "Series II" [...] guise, {{otherwise known as}} the JH series. Prime Minister Julia Gillard attended the February launch to drive the first example off Holden's production line before full-scale production commenced in March. Holden has confirmed an initial local content level of between 40 and 50percent if assessed by retail value, with an aim of increasing Cruze localization over time. Series II styling revisions to the grille, lower air intake, and bumper have softened the front-end to bear a closer resemblance to Holden's larger VE II Commodore. Further differentiation from the original has been achieved via the fitment of amber front indicator lights, jewelled bezel headlamps, remodelled wheel trims, and through adjustments to the lower portion of the rear bumper. Carrying over largely unchanged is the 1.8-liter petrol inline-four, tweaked to yield slight enhancements in drivability. When automatic transmission is specified, the 1.8-liter is now teamed with GM's six-speed 6T30 unit, lighter and more compact than the previous 6T40. Diesel remains optional for [...] "CD" [...] and [...] "CDX" [...] specifications over the standard 1.8-liter petrol. Alterations to the 2.0-liter turbodiesel have resulted in an additional [...] and [...] and a slight reduction in fuel consumption for the manual variant, now a six-speed unit. However, the headline change is {{the release of the}} turbocharged 1.4-liter engine, dubbed iTi by Holden for intelligent turbo induction. The inclusion of the 1.4 also brings an upgrade to electric (as opposed to hydraulic) power steering and affixes a Watt's linkage to the <b>torsion</b> <b>beam</b> rear suspension. Linked with six-speed manual or automatic transmissions, the 1.4 is fitted as standard to the new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] sports-oriented trims, but is available at extra cost on the base [...] "CD". The new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] models have their respective badges embossed onto the grille insert, are fitted with their own front bumper design, and feature side skirts, chrome exterior door handles, a rear lip spoiler, and five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels. Over the [...] "CD", [...] "SRi" [...] gains a leather-covered steering wheel rim and shift lever, with the [...] "SRi-V" [...] extending this upholstering to the seating. A heat function for the front seats, keyless entry with push-button engine start, reversing sensors, and seven-inch LCD multimedia unit are also part of the [...] "SRi-V" [...] equipment list. This multimedia system integrates satellite navigation, the CD and DVD players, and a 10GB internal hard disk drive. In mid-November 2011, Holden released the MY12 update to the Series II Cruze. This update coincided with the release of the hatchback body variant and saw Bluetooth telephone connectivity standard across the range.|$|E

40|$|Two-dimensional (2 D) optical {{scanners}} with large-area {{mirrors and}} large angular rotation are {{of great interest}} for applications in display, printing, optical scanning and sensing, optical data storage, and free-space optical links between satellites. The Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) technology is very attractive to reduce the size, weight, {{and complexity of the}} optical scanners. Several bulk- [1, 2] and surface-micromachined [3, 4] 2 D scanners have been reported. To achieve large angular rotation for large-area micromirrors, the mirrors need to be suspended high above the substrate. This requires the use of complicated processing steps such as thick sacrificial materials or wafer bonding with bulk-micromachined structures. Previously, we reported a novel micromechanical structure called Micro-Elevator by Self-Assembly (MESA) [5] that can raise the surface-micromachined plates to several hundred micrometers above the wafer surface. In this paper, we report a novel 2 D scanner realized by the MESA technology. Large optical deflection angles (> k 14 ") have been achieved for large-area mirrors 400 x 400 pm 2 without employing thick sacrificial layers. The schematic structure of the MESA-based 2 D scanner is shown in Fig. 1. The micromirror is attached to a pair of suspended frames through two sets of orthogonal <b>torsion</b> <b>beams.</b> It can be rotated around two axes by applying electrostatic force between the mirror and the quadrant electrodes on the substrate.

50|$|Some {{front-wheel drive}} {{automobiles}} use a related type of <b>torsion</b> <b>beam</b> suspension, usually called a twist-beam rear suspension, {{in which the}} rear wheels are carried on trailing arms connected by a laterally mounted <b>torsion</b> <b>beam,</b> as found on the Mitsubishi Debonair. The actual springing medium for these is usually coil springs. The <b>torsion</b> <b>beam</b> functions both as wheel locating arm and as an anti-roll bar to resist lateral motion of the wheels as the body leans in turns. Its advantages are that it is inexpensive to manufacture and install, and engages a minimum amount of interior volume, leaving more space for the carriage of passengers, cargo, and other components. Because the <b>torsion</b> <b>beam</b> acts in the lateral plane, not vertically, the twist beam axle cannot provide ride height adjustment, and it suffers, to some extent, similar car handling limitations as other beam axle suspensions. However these limitations may not be apparent on the road, because of the trend towards firmer, more sporty suspension setups with more limited wheel travel. Twist-beam rear suspensions were pioneered on the Volkswagen Golf in the early 1970s, and remain common on compact cars and minivans.|$|E

The Olympic trampolines consist of launch slopes {{in the form of}} steel platforms and landing zones {{on the side of the}} mountain. The complex blends into the landscape particularly well, as a result of the in-depth location studies carried out during the planning stages. The structure of the launch slope platforms contributes to this result with its rigid <b>torsion</b> <b>beams</b> which exploit the height of the snow casing to create a dynamic, lightweight profile. One of the original features of the Pragelato Olympic platforms is the way in which the profile is fully adjustable in the vertical direction.
