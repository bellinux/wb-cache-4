5|$|Within {{eukaryotic}} cells DNA {{is organized}} into long structures called chromosomes. During cell division these chromosomes are duplicated {{in the process}} of DNA replication, providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi and protists) store most of <b>their</b> <b>DNA</b> inside the cell nucleus and some of <b>their</b> <b>DNA</b> in organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. In contrast prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store <b>their</b> <b>DNA</b> only in the cytoplasm. Within the eukaryotic chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.|$|E

5|$|Maggots {{found on}} corpses are useful to {{forensic}} entomologists. Maggot species {{can be identified}} by their anatomical features and by matching <b>their</b> <b>DNA.</b> Maggots of different species of flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly well-defined times {{after the death of}} the victim, and so do their predators, such as beetles in the family Histeridae. Thus, {{the presence or absence of}} particular species provides evidence for the time since death, and sometimes other details such as the place of death, when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of {{the sperm}} or egg, which {{manifest}} in the offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, {{which is likely to}} be more important than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate <b>their</b> <b>DNA</b> into their hosts. Organisms do not want to mutate: mutation just happens. Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, but a very small minority turn out to be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between genes {{can be measured}} by comparing the sequence alignment of <b>their</b> <b>DNA.</b> The degree of sequence similarity between homologous genes is called conserved sequence. Most changes to a gene's sequence do not affect its function and so genes accumulate mutations over time by neutral molecular evolution. Additionally, any selection on a gene will cause its sequence to diverge at a different rate. Genes under stabilizing selection are constrained and so change more slowly whereas genes under directional selection change sequence more rapidly. The sequence differences between genes {{can be used for}} phylogenetic analyses to study how those genes have evolved and how the organisms they come from are related.|$|E

He eventually found 20 ponies that resembled those he remembered from his childhood, and removed them from the bog to his stables. In 1995, he had blood typing performed on the ponies by Weatherby's Ireland, which identified <b>their</b> <b>DNA</b> markers. Subsequent DNA testing showed them to be a unique breed that formed a separate population from other local ponies and from other breeds in Ireland and Great Britain. Of these 20 ponies, only one was a stallion, named Flashy Fox. Between 1995 and 2012, he sired more than 140 foals, and {{played a significant role}} in repopulating the breed.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria divide by binary fission, {{similar to}} {{bacterial}} cell division. The regulation of this division differs between eukaryotes. In many single-celled eukaryotes, their growth and division {{is linked to}} the cell cycle. For example, a single mitochondrion may divide synchronously with the nucleus. This division and segregation process must be tightly controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one mitochondrion. In other eukaryotes (in mammals for example), mitochondria may replicate <b>their</b> <b>DNA</b> and divide mainly in response to the energy needs of the cell, rather than in phase with the cell cycle. When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and divide. When the energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed or become inactive. In such examples, and in contrast to the situation in many single celled eukaryotes, mitochondria are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter cells during the division of the cytoplasm. Understanding of mitochondrial dynamics, which is described as the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, has revealed that functional and structural alterations in mitochondrial morphology are important factors in pathologies associated with several disease conditions.|$|E
5|$|Molecular clock {{evidence}} using DNA {{suggests the}} macaroni penguin split from its closest relative, the royal penguin (Eudyptes schlegeli), around 1.5million years ago. Although {{the two have}} generally been considered separate species, the close similarities of <b>their</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences has led some, such as the Australian ornithologists Les Christidis and Walter Boles, to treat the royal as a subspecies of the macaroni. The two species are very similar in appearance, although the royal penguin has a white face instead of the usually black face of the macaroni. Interbreeding with the Indo-Pacific subspecies of the southern rockhopper penguin (E. chrysocome filholi) has been reported at Heard and Marion Islands, with three hybrids recorded there by a 1987–88 Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition.|$|E

5|$|The {{black bears}} of Yosemite were once famous for {{breaking}} into parked cars to steal food. They were also an encouraged tourist sight {{for many years}} at the park's garbage dumps, where bears congregated to eat park visitors' garbage and tourists gathered to photograph the bears. Increasing encounters between bears and humans and increasing damage to property led to an aggressive campaign to discourage bears from relying on human food or interacting with people and their property. The open-air dumps were closed; all trash receptacles were replaced with bear-proof receptacles; all campgrounds were equipped with bear-proof food lockers so that people would not leave food in their vehicles, which were easy targets for the powerful and resourceful bears. Because bears who show aggression towards people usually are eventually destroyed, park personnel have continued {{to come up with}} innovative ways to have bears associate humans and their property with unpleasant experiences, such as being hit with rubber bullets. Today, about 30 bears a year are captured and ear-tagged and <b>their</b> <b>DNA</b> is sampled so that, when bear damage occurs, rangers can ascertain which bear is causing the problem.|$|E

5|$|Cells {{are known}} to {{eliminate}} three types of damage to <b>their</b> <b>DNA</b> by chemically reversing it. These mechanisms do not require a template, since the types of damage they counteract can occur in {{only one of the}} four bases. Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to the type of damage incurred and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone. The formation of pyrimidine dimers upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases. The photoreactivation process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme photolyase, whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from blue/UV light (300–500nm wavelength) to promote catalysis. Photolyase, an old enzyme present in bacteria, fungi, and most animals no longer functions in humans, who instead use nucleotide excision repair to repair damage from UV irradiation. Another type of damage, methylation of guanine bases, is directly reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT), the bacterial equivalent of which is called ogt. This is an expensive process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once; that is, the reaction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic. A generalized response to methylating agents in bacteria is known as the adaptive response and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of alkylation repair enzymes. The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there has}} been {{uncertainty}} {{as to whether the}} European species known as Battarrea stevenii is a unique species or merely a polymorphic variant of B.phalloides. The taxon has been described as both a variety (as B.phalloides var. stevenii by Cleland and Cheel in 1916) and as a form (as B.phalloides f. stevenii by Calonge in 2004). In 1995, mycologist Roy Watling opined that B.stevenii differs in having spores that are colored more orange-tawny, slightly larger (5–6.5 by 5.75–7µm, as opposed to 4.5–5.25 by 4.5–5.75µm), and less ornamented. Further, B.stevenii is thought to have a larger fruit body size, a more coarsely scaly stipe, and lack of mucilage in the volva and the innermost parts of the stem. The presence or absence of mucilage has been traditionally considered the significant characteristic separating the species. In 1904, Lászlo Hollós proposed the idea of a single polymorphic species; in 1942, Paul Marshall Rea, after studying 25 specimens from southern California, concluded that B.stevenii was conspecific with B.phalloides and represented a single species. An analysis of a number of European specimens—using both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics in addition to molecular analysis of ITS regions of the 5.8S rDNA—also suggested both to be conspecific. The authors of this study considered the differences in spore ornamentation and stipe hyphae to be insufficient to discriminate them as two species; they did, however, note that their inability to locate the type material for both species limited the conclusiveness of their suggestion. The conspecificity of the species was supported in a later study that used traditional and molecular methods to compare field-collected English specimens and an extensive range of herbarium material collected from around the world. They found that material labeled B.stevenii generally had a greater range of cap and stem sizes, while that labeled B.phalloides was generally more consistent, and smaller. However, the B.phalloides material they studied was generally from similar habitats in the UK, while the B.stevenii material originated {{from a wide variety of}} locales and habitats, suggesting that environmental factors influence fruit body morphology. Evidence pointing to conspecificity included the continuum of spore sizes between the two, and the lack of any significant differences between <b>their</b> <b>DNA.</b> In 2006, however, based on a study of specimens collected in China, other scientists considered them to be independent species.|$|E

In addition, they shared the ability to carry out generalized transduction. They could be differentiated, however, by the restriction patterns of <b>their</b> <b>DNAs,</b> with the exception of 41 c and 22 a, which seemed to be identical.

5|$|The {{conventions}} of Moonlight are based, in part, on a unique mythology. Some {{parts of the}} mythology that are common include a sire, that is the vampire who turns a human into a vampire; though in the show the sire must teach him or her how to live as one. A vampire's bite {{is not enough to}} turn a human into a vampire; the human, when near death, must drink the sire's blood or have vampire blood in his or her system at the moment of death. The process of vampirization also affects their genetics, causing <b>their</b> <b>DNA</b> to be fundamentally altered to suit their bodies' new state. This makes genetic testing between vampires and their human relatives impossible unless the vampire has a sample of their own human DNA from before they were turned, such as a lock of hair. They must consume human blood to survive. They also develop psychic powers and can glimpse the future and the past. This ability, along with their night vision, is an extension of their heightened senses. Daylight does not kill vampires, but does make them progressively weaker. Silver and fire are toxic, whereas garlic, holy water and crucifixes are useless. A vampire's image cannot be captured with analogue cameras containing silver emulsion in the film; digital cameras are able to capture an image because they do not use silver emulsion. Though undead, vampires have a pulse, are not cold blooded (but still don't produce body heat as seen in episode 11 so as heat signature cameras won't see them), and cannot turn into a bat. The best ways to kill them are by decapitation or burning; a stake through the heart is painful but only causes paralysis. Moonlight vampires have many of the preternatural abilities as described in vampire mythology; they have superhuman strength and speed, they heal rapidly from any wound, they can defy gravity to a limited degree to perform parkour feats, their bite has hypnotic effects on weak-minded humans, and they are immortal. Their powers increase as they get older. Their blood has drug-like affects when consumed by humans; causing euphoria and temporarily heightened senses.|$|E
