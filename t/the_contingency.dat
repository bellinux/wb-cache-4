5|$|Factors {{affecting}} one's {{ability to}} delay gratification {{depend on whether}} the delay contingency is self-imposed (delay can be terminated at {{the will of the}} person waiting) or externally imposed by another person, institution or circumstance. When <b>the</b> <b>contingency</b> is self-imposed, the physical presence of the reward seems to aid in delaying gratification. On the other hand, when the delay is externally imposed, children are not able to wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|STS-125 was {{the only}} planned shuttle mission after the Columbia {{accident}} to be launched into a low-inclination orbit that did not allow rendezvous with the International Space Station. Due to the inclination and other orbit parameters of Hubble, Atlantis would {{have been unable to}} use the International Space Station as a safe haven in the event of structural or mechanical failure. To preserve NASA's post-Columbia requirement of having shuttle Launch On Need (LON) rescue capability, STS-400 was the flight designation given to <b>the</b> <b>Contingency</b> Shuttle Crew Support (CSCS) mission which would have been flown by Endeavour in the event Atlantis became disabled during STS-125. After Atlantis performed the late inspection and was cleared for re-entry, Endeavour was officially released from stand-by status on Thursday, 21 May.|$|E
5|$|The {{acceleration}} of the German naval building programme in 1907–1908 forced H. H. Asquith's Liberal Government to yield to public pressure and authorise more ships for the 1909–1910 Construction Programme. Only a single battleship and a battlecruiser had been authorised in 1908–1909, but three battleships and a battlecruiser were authorised in 1909–1910 with another three battleships and a battlecruiser planned as contingency ships to placate {{the public and the}} Admiralty. Continuing pressure forced the Government to announce in July 1909 that <b>the</b> <b>contingency</b> ships would also be built. This pressure also allowed the Admiralty to gain approval to improve the size and power of its new ships so as to maintain qualitative superiority over the new German dreadnoughts then under construction.|$|E
30|$|According to {{the results}} of C- 703 system, when {{considering}} three <b>contingency,</b> <b>the</b> results of objective function is consistent with the results of <b>the</b> first <b>contingency</b> which shows that <b>the</b> first <b>contingency</b> plays a dominant position when considering <b>the</b> previous three <b>contingency.</b> <b>The</b> system adjustment mainly aims to the constraints of <b>the</b> first <b>contingency</b> which can meet the constraints of other contingency as well.

30|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} {{that there are}} two power flow dips in the result of M 2, which are the operation conditions when No. 176 line and No. 186 line are <b>the</b> <b>contingencies,</b> respectively. <b>The</b> reason is that two lines are parallel, leading to the impedances of these two parallel lines considerably smaller than that of lines around. When the power system operates normally or other lines are <b>the</b> <b>contingencies,</b> large amount of active power tends to flow on these two lines. However, when these two lines are <b>the</b> <b>contingencies,</b> large amount of active power is distributed on other lines, thereby reducing the maximum of line power flows.|$|R
5|$|Children {{under five}} years old display the least {{effective}} strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of <b>the</b> <b>contingency</b> that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions). Declines in self-regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s saw the {{introduction}} of battalion specialisations—light, parachute, mechanised and motorised—in the regiment {{and the formation of}} a ready deployment force. The later concept was first tested during Operation Morris Dance, <b>the</b> <b>contingency</b> mounted in response to the 1987 Fiji coup. 5/7 RAR subsequently developed as a mechanised battalion equipped with M113 armoured personnel carriers, while 3 RAR re-roled as a parachute battalion. In 1988, during the Australian Bicentennial celebrations, a contingent drawn from the battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Salter of 1 RAR, supported by an Australian Army Band, was deployed as part of the bicentennial celebrations to mount public duties at Buckingham Palace Windsor Castle, St James' Palace and the Tower of London, the first Australian troops to do so since the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. In 1991, the two Brisbane-based battalions—6 RAR and 8/9 RAR—then part of the 6th Brigade, became Ready Reserve battalions. Following trials of the concept 6 RAR requipped as a motorised battalion in 1992, while 8/9 RAR commenced is conversion in 1996. Each battalion was initially issued modified 6x6 Land Rover Perenties until a purpose-built infantry mobility vehicle could be acquired.|$|E

40|$|Neutral cues that predict {{emotional}} events (emotional harbingers) acquire emotional {{properties and}} attract attention. Given {{the importance of}} emotional harbingers for future survival, it is desirable to flexibly learn new facts about emotional harbingers when needed. However, recent research revealed that {{it is harder to}} learn new associations for emotional harbingers than cues that predict non-emotional events (neutral harbingers). In the current study, we addressed whether this impaired association learning for emotional harbingers is altered by one’s awareness of <b>the</b> <b>contingencies</b> between cues and emotional outcomes. Across 3 studies, we found that one’s awareness of <b>the</b> <b>contingencies</b> determines subsequent association learning of emotional harbingers. Emotional harbingers produced worse association learning than neutral harbingers when people were not aware of <b>the</b> <b>contingencies</b> between cues and emotional outcomes, but produced better association learning when people were aware of <b>the</b> <b>contingencies.</b> These results suggest that emotional harbingers do not always suffer from impaired association learning and can show facilitated learning depending on one’s contingency awareness...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} {{systematic}} analysis of all dangerous N − 2 contingencies observed in medium size model of Polish power grid with about 2600 power lines. Each of <b>the</b> dangerous <b>contingencies</b> {{is composed of}} two initially tripped lines and one or more lines that overloaded as the result. There are 443 distinct contingencies that do not lead to immediate islanding of the grid. In {{the scope of the}} work we analyze the statistics of individual line participation in those contingencies and show that some lines have anomalously high rate of participation in <b>the</b> <b>contingencies.</b> Next, we show that about third of all <b>the</b> <b>contingencies</b> can be associated with the subgrids that are connected {{to the rest of the}} grid via small set of power line chains. <b>The</b> <b>contingencies</b> arise when cutting some of those chains results in overload of the others. Simple reduction of power grid corresponding to aggregation of chain components significantly reduces the total number of distinct <b>contingencies.</b> <b>The</b> rest of <b>the</b> <b>contingencies</b> are closely related to a set of almost dangerous N − 1 contingencies that result in heavy loading of particular lines. Tripping many different additional lines on top of these N − 1 contingencies results in an overload of one or more lines.
