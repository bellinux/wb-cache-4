50|$|Hay can be raked into rows {{as it is}} cut, then <b>turned</b> {{periodically}} <b>to</b> dry, {{particularly if}} a modern swather is used. Or, especially with older equipment or methods, <b>the</b> <b>hay</b> is cut and allowed to lie spread {{out in the field}} until it is dry, then raked into rows for processing into bales afterwards. During the drying period, which can take several days, the process is usually sped up by <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> cut <b>hay</b> over with a hay rake or spreading it out with a tedder. If it rains while <b>the</b> <b>hay</b> is drying, <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> windrow can also allow it to dry faster. However, <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> <b>hay</b> too often or too roughly can also cause drying leaf matter to fall off, reducing the nutrients available to animals. Drying can also be sped up by mechanized processes, such as use of a hay conditioner, or by use of chemicals sprayed onto <b>the</b> <b>hay</b> to speed evaporation of moisture, though these are more expensive techniques, not in general use except in areas where there is a combination of modern technology, high prices for hay, and too much rain for hay to dry properly.|$|R
60|$|Later, {{when the}} morning was hot, and the {{honeysuckle}} had ceased to breathe, {{and all the other}} scents were moving in the air about us, when all the field was down, when I had seen the last trembling ecstasy of the harebells, trembling to fall; when the thick clump of purple vetch had sunk; when the green swaths were settling, and the silver swaths were glistening and glittering as the sun came along them, in the hot ripe morning we worked together <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> <b>hay,</b> tipping over <b>the</b> yesterday's swaths with our forks, and bringing yesterday's fresh, hidden flowers into the death of sunlight.|$|R
50|$|Reconnaissance {{indicated}} that the Chinese forces were entrenched at Beicang, six miles from Tianjin, {{on both sides of}} the Hai River. The Americans, British and Japanese advanced on the west side of the river and the Russians and French advanced up the east side. The armies bivouacked the night of August 4 near Xigu Fort. The plan was for the Japanese, supported by the British and Americans, <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> right flank of the Chinese lines and for the Russians and French <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> left flank on the opposite side of <b>the</b> <b>Hay</b> River.|$|R

50|$|A {{struggle}} in {{any type of}} keeping hay is {{that it must be}} totally dry. Otherwise, when piled up in a hayloft, it will start to compost. The insulation provided by <b>the</b> other <b>hay</b> ensures that thermophilic bacteria involved in decomposition will be at their ideal temperature, thus <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> good <b>hay</b> into dirt. That is also why farmers are so determined to keep <b>hay</b> off <b>the</b> ground, since it would absorb moisture.|$|R

50|$|A higher {{steering}} ratio {{means that the}} steering wheel is <b>turned</b> more <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> wheels <b>turning,</b> {{but it will be}} easier <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> steering wheel. A lower {{steering ratio}} means that the steering wheel is <b>turned</b> less <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> wheels <b>turning,</b> but it will be harder <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> steering wheel. Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher steering ratio, which will make the steering wheel easier <b>to</b> <b>turn.</b> If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> steering wheel. In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier <b>to</b> <b>turn,</b> so <b>the</b> steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The steering wheel is therefore harder <b>to</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|R
