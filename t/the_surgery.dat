40|$|Imagine {{that you}} have just {{received}} a colon cancer diagnosis and need to choose between two different surgical treatments. One <b>surgery,</b> <b>the</b> "complicated surgery," has a lower mortality rate (16 % vs. 20 %) but compared to <b>the</b> other <b>surgery,</b> <b>the</b> "uncomplicated surgery," also carries an additional 1 % risk of each of four serious complications: colostomy, chronic diarrhea, wound infection, or an intermittent bowel obstruction. <b>The</b> complicated <b>surgery</b> dominates <b>the</b> uncomplicated <b>surgery</b> as long as life with complications is In our first survey, 51 % of a sample (recruited from the cafeteria of a university medical center) selected the dominated alternative, <b>the</b> uncomplicated <b>surgery,</b> justifying this choice {{by saying that the}} death risks for <b>the</b> two <b>surgeries</b> were essentially <b>the</b> same and that <b>the</b> uncomplicated <b>surgery</b> avoided <b>the</b> risk of complications. In follow-up surveys, preference for <b>the</b> uncomplicated <b>surgery</b> remained relatively consistent (39 % [...] 51 %) despite (a) presenting the risks in frequencies rather than percents, (b) grouping the 4 complications into a single category, or (c) giving <b>the</b> uncomplicated <b>surgery</b> a small chance of complications as well. Even when a pre-decision "focusing exercise" required people to state directly their preferences between life with each complication versus death, 49 % still chose the uncomplicated People's fear of complications leads them to ignore important differences between treatments. This tendency appears remarkably resistant to debiasing approaches and likely leads patients to make healthcare decisions that are inconsistent...|$|R

40|$|Background/aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the results of}} the patients who underwent surgery for biliary pancreatitis, with respect to tim-ing of operation. Methods: 192 Patients underwent surgery for biliary pancreatitis between January 1990 and December 1999. The patients were retrospectively separated into three groups: early surgery (within 72 hours after admission), delayed surgery (between 3 and 15 days after admission) and elective surgery (after 15 days). Results: There were 98 patients in <b>the</b> early <b>surgery</b> group, 46 in <b>the</b> delayed <b>surgery</b> group and 48 in <b>the</b> elective <b>surgery</b> group. <b>The</b> number of Hanson's criteria pre-sent was between 3 and 5 in 58. 2 % of the cases in <b>the</b> early <b>surgery</b> group and in 54. 3 % of the cases in <b>the</b> delayed <b>surgery</b> group, whereas 62. 5 % of the cases in <b>the</b> elective <b>surgery</b> group had 0 - 2. APACHE II score was in the 6 - 10 range in 43. 9 % of the cases in <b>the</b> early <b>surgery</b> group and in 39. 1 % of the cases in <b>the</b> delayed <b>surgery</b> group, whereas 66. 7 % of the cases in <b>the</b> elec-tive <b>surgery</b> group had between 0 and 5. The most frequent oper-ations in the early and delayed surgery groups was cholecystec-tomy, common bile duct exploration, and T-tube placement (60. 2 % and 69. 6 %, respectively), whereas it were laparoscopic cholecystectomy in <b>the</b> elective <b>surgery</b> group (66. 7 %). Pancreatitis-releated complication rates in the early, delayed and elective surgery groups were 20. 4 %, 17. 4 % and 8. 3 %, respectively. Mortality rates were 5. 1 % and 4. 3 % in the early and delayed surgery groups, respectively. There was no deaths in <b>the</b> elective <b>surgery</b> group. Conclusion: In biliary pancreati-tis, surgery should not be considered as a primary option until the resolution of the pancreatic inflammation and its systemic effects. It should be employed only when the clinical picture does not ameliorate in spite of conservative treatment...|$|R
