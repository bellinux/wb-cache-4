5000|$|In automobiles, <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> {{are part}} of the {{steering}} mechanism.

50|$|The {{longitudinal}} baulks, {{and therefore}} the rails, were kept to gauge by 'transoms' - transverse timber spacers - and iron tie-bars. The transom kept the longitudinals from getting too close together; <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> stopped them spreading too far apart. In later years <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> were replaced by strap bolts. These were bolted to the transoms and passed through a hole drilled through the longitudinal to a nut on the outside.|$|R
50|$|The {{accompanying}} photograph shows lateral iron supports {{between the}} flying buttresses; {{it is not}} known when these external <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> were installed. <b>The</b> technology would have been available {{at the time of the}} initial construction, but the extra support might not have been considered necessary until after the collapse in 1284, or even later. In <b>the</b> 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> were removed; <b>the</b> thinking was that they were ungraceful and unnecessary. However, the oscillations created by the wind became amplified, and the choir partially disassociated itself from the transept. Subsequently, <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> were reinstalled, but this time with rods made of steel. Since steel is less ductile than iron, the structure became more rigid, possibly causing additional fissures.|$|R
50|$|If threads are {{cut into}} a {{cylindrical}} rod, that minimum area occurs {{at the root of}} the thread. Often rods are upset (made thicker at the ends) so that <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> does not become weaker when {{threads are cut}} into it.|$|E
50|$|Most {{prevalent}} work {{principle for}} CSH is Bell Crank Mechanism. The Bell crank lever rotates around the Fulcrum point. One {{end of the}} Bell crank lever {{is connected to the}} pipe ‘P’, the other end is connected to the spring by <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> Thus when the pipe moves down from cold to hot condition, the point P moves down, and as it moves down the Bell crank lever will rotate in the anti clock wise direction & tie rod connected to the spring will be pulled in, by which the spring gets further compressed. When the pipe moves up the bell crank lever will rotate (in the clock wise direction) & <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> connected to spring will be pushed out thus allowing the spring to expand or relax.|$|E
50|$|Bump steer can be {{adjusted}} by moving any of the front suspension components pickup points Up, down, in or out. For example: Say the inner tie rod mounting point is moved up either by moving the rack or modifying the pitman arm mounting point or arm drop. The result is the tie rod's arc will change. It will then require a change in <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> length to be in proper alignment so the radius of the arc will change as well. If the radius arc of <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is longer than stock on a front steer setup then the car will have more toe understeer. If the same scenario was applied to a rear steering design, then the car would exhibit less toe understeer. This is because the effective length of the tie rods is affected by its static length/arc radius, its pickup points and the angle of its arc during each phase of suspension travel {{in relation to the}} control arms.|$|E

50|$|A simple {{approximation}} {{to perfect}} Ackermann steering geometry may be generated {{by moving the}} steering pivot points inward so as to lie on a line drawn between the steering kingpins and {{the centre of the}} rear axle.

With perfect Ackermann, at any angle of steering, the centre point of all of the circles traced by all wheels will lie at a common point. Note that this may be difficult to arrange in practice with simple linkages, and designers are advised to draw or analyse their steering systems over the full range of steering angles.|$|E

In this study the structural analysis of a tie rod end part for a van-type vehicle is carried out by finite element (FE) modeling of the body, the joint and the bearing. Hence, unlike the previous studies in literature, each component of <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> end is included in FE model and a complete assembly is analyzed by means of contact interactions between parts.

40|$|The {{tie rods}} in the Duomo are {{structural}} elements, subject to monotonic loading and cyclic loading. Non-destructive testing {{is used to}} find cracks and determine their geometry. Lamb waves are applied to determine the presence of cracks in <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> and to estimate their positions. The cracks are located using eddy current testing. Finally the geometries of the cracks are determined using active infrared thermography. Experimental testing {{in the field of}} fracture mechanics is done to determine the fracture toughness of wrought iron. Combining the geometry of the crack with the fracture toughness of the material, leads to an estimation of the critical crack size. The tie rods are made of wrought iron. The material properties are very heterogeneous. A tie rod is made out of multiple wrought iron bars of 1 - 1. 5 meters. These bars are welded together under an angle of 27 °. Cracks of two damaged tie rods are found to be under such an angle. The search for cracks will be concentrated on inclined cracks with a repetition of 1 - 1. 5 meters. Lamb waves is the first technique applied. An ultrasonic tomograph A 1040 MIRA is used for testing. The modelling of Lamb waves travelling in tie rods and the signal processing are based on the possibilities of the MIRA. The dispersion behaviour of Lamb waves is modelled to understand the wave propagation in tie rods and the influence it has on the testing done with the MIRA. Using this knowledge, proper testing settings are found. Subsequently, signal processing is considered. The main objective of this part {{is to be able to}} identify cracks present in the tie rods. The position of the cracks in <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is determined using eddy current testing. Commercial eddy current probes are too sensitive to discontinuities to be applied to tie rods. Therefore, new probes are developed to overcome this drawback. Two probes are designed, both for the horizontal face and for the vertical face of <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> The vertical face of the tie rods are best accessible. Therefore, on-site testing is done with the probe specially designed for that face. Active infrared thermography is implemented to establish the geometry of the crack. A finite element analysis has been performed to model the propagation of heat through a tie rod. This is followed by experimental testing in the laboratory carried out on a broken tie rod. Finally, the results of the modelling and of the experimental testing are compared. The last part has a fracture mechanical nature. The fracture toughness of the material is determined assuming both linear-elastic and elastic-plastic material behaviour. Also the fatigue behaviour is evaluated. The values obtained from experimental testing have been applied to a simplified model of the crack geometry to determine the critical crack size of <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rod,</b> for monotonic loading, and the threshold crack size, for cyclic loading. Fatigue life is predicted taking the threshold crack size as the initial crack size and the critical crack size as the final crack size. <br/...|$|E

50|$|A {{parallelogram}} {{steering linkage}} is called such because like its name sake {{the two sides}} of the linkage run parallel to each other and are equal in distance. This type of steering linkage uses four <b>tie</b> <b>rods,</b> one inner and one outer on each side (left and right), a center link (which runs between <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rods),</b> an idler arm on the passenger side, and a pitman arm on the driver side. The pitman arm attaches to the steering gear output shaft which is also commonly called the pitman shaft. The pitman arm attaches to the center link and is moved by turning the steering wheel. The center link transfers the movement from the pitman arm and pitman shaft to the idler arm on the passenger side. <b>The</b> inner <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are mounted to the center link and transfer steering motion to the steering arms and outer <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> All of <b>the</b> joints which mount these components are constructed of small ball and socket joints to provide the necessary freedom of movement required to maintain control over the vehicle while it is in motion. The most common type of steering is the parallelogram. The cross-steer and Haltenberger linkage designs are used on some trucks and vans.|$|R
