5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of <b>the</b> <b>sinking,</b> Royal Oaks survivors were billeted in the towns and villages of Orkney. A funeral parade for the dead took place at Lyness on Hoy on 16 October; many of the surviving crew, having lost all their own clothing on the ship, attended in borrowed boiler suits and gym shoes. They were generally granted a few days survivors' leave by the navy, and then assigned to ships and roles elsewhere. Kenneth Toop, who survived <b>the</b> <b>sinking</b> while serving as a Boy, First Class on Royal Oak, served as the Royal Oak Association's Honorary Secretary. An annual ceremony of remembrance is held by the survivors and descendants of the crew at the Naval War Memorial, Southsea, on the anniversary of <b>the</b> <b>sinking.</b> The last remaining survivor of Royal Oak, Arthur Smith, who had been a 17-year old Boy, First Class when the ship was struck, died on 11 December 2016.

40|$|Abstract. When {{communication}} in sensor networks occurs over wireless links, confidential {{information about the}} communication patterns between sensor nodes could be leaked even when encryption is used to protect the actual contents of the messages. The communication patterns, which often reveal higher volumes of traffic near <b>the</b> <b>sink,</b> could allow an attacker to identify the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> node. With this information, an attacker could potentially disable the network by destroying <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> In this paper, we present <b>the</b> decoy <b>sink</b> protocol, which protects the location of <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> in target tracking sensor network applications by forwarding data to a decoy sink for aggregation before the aggregated data is forwarded to <b>the</b> real <b>sink</b> from <b>the</b> decoy <b>sink.</b> Combining indirection and data aggregation in our protocol creates more traffic away from <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> and reduces <b>the</b> amount of traffic near <b>the</b> <b>sink,</b> which makes traffic analysis more difficult for attackers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The data {{gathering}} manner of wireless sensor networks, in which data is forwarded towards <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> node, {{would cause the}} nodes near <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> node to transmit more data than those far from it. Most {{data gathering}} mechanisms now do not do well in balancing the energy consumption among nodes with different distances to <b>the</b> <b>sink,</b> thus they can hardly avoid the problem that nodes near <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> consume energy more quickly, which may cause the network rupture from <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> node. This paper presents a data gathering mechanism called PODA, which grades the output power of nodes according to their distances from <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> node. PODA balances energy consumption by setting the nodes near <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> with lower output power and the nodes far from <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> with higher output power. Simulation {{results show that the}} PODA mechanism can achieve even energy consumption in the entire network, improve energy efficiency and prolong the network lifetime.

30|$|The {{model is}} {{considered}} with N sensor nodes scattered uniformly in an area, {{and all the}} N sensor nodes are duty cycled. The nodes are named based on their roles in the network as shown in Fig.  1. The nodes are differentiated into three groups: relay sensor, network coder sensor, and <b>the</b> <b>Sink.</b> <b>The</b> relay sensor nodes generate data and transmit the generated data to <b>the</b> <b>Sink.</b> <b>The</b> network coder sensor nodes encode the raw native data which comes from the relay nodes before transmission. <b>The</b> <b>Sink</b> receive data and decode the data from network coder nodes. In the area, the relay nodes can communicate with <b>the</b> <b>Sink</b> using a multi-hop communication. However, the network coder nodes use a single hop to communicate with <b>the</b> <b>Sink.</b> <b>The</b> nodes {{in the range of}} <b>the</b> <b>Sink</b> are defined as the network-coding layer, and all the network coder nodes are in the layer.|$|R
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the removal of unwanted fluid through the source-sink pair. The source consists of fluid issuing out of a nozzle {{in the form of a}} jet and <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> is a pipe that is kept some distance from the source pipe. Of concern is the percentage of source fluid sucked through <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> <b>The</b> experiments have been carried in a large glass water tank. The source nozzle diameter is 6 Â mm and <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> pipe diameter is either 10 or 20 Â mm. The horizontal and vertical separations and angles between these source and sink pipes are adjustable. The flow was visualized using KMnO 4 dye, planer laser induced fluorescence and particle streak photographs. To obtain the effectiveness (that is percentage of source fluid entering <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> pipe), titration method is used. The velocity profiles with and without <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> were obtained using particle image velocimetry. <b>The</b> <b>sink</b> flow rate to obtain a certain effectiveness increase dramatically with lateral separation. <b>The</b> <b>sink</b> diameter and <b>the</b> angle between source and <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> axes don't influence effectiveness as much as the lateral separation...|$|R

Based on the interference model and the activity of sensor nodes around <b>the</b> <b>sink,</b> we derive <b>the</b> failure probability of the transmission from a source node located one hop away from <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> using Gaussian approximation. Under the requirement of 1 % failure probability of transmission, we determine <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> capacity, which is defined as the maximum number of concurrent sensor nodes located one hop away from <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> We demonstrate that as the node activity of the MAI decreases, the variation of <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> capacity due to the node activity of the NI becomes more significant.
