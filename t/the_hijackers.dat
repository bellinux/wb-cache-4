The plane takes off from Mumbai's Sahar International Airport and lands in Karachi, where the four Abu Nidal terrorists, disguised as security officers escorting a Libyan diplomat, hijack the plane. Neerja quickly alerts the cockpit, and the three American pilots escape through the overhead hatch, fleeing to the terminal under fire from <b>the</b> <b>hijackers.</b> The American pilots had {{just enough time to}} escape, as <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> did not realize that the cockpit of a Boeing 747 is located upstairs.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{minutes into}} the flight, <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> injured at least three people (possibly killing one), {{forcibly}} breached the cockpit, and overpowered the captain and first officer. Atta, an al-Qaeda member and licensed commercial pilot, took over the controls. Air-traffic controllers noticed the flight was in distress when the crew was no longer responding.

The survivors shove the teenager outside as <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> slowly advances towards him.. The teenager pulls out the bomb he's been hiding and threatens to blow up the plane unless they let him back in. They do not and the teenager triggers the bomb, killing himself and blowing a large opening in the airplane, wounding Professor Sagai. Mano runs off with Mrs. Neal.

5|$|Some {{passengers}} and crew members who called from the aircraft using the cabin airphone service and mobile phones provided details: several hijackers were aboard each plane; they used mace, tear gas, or pepper spray to overcome attendants; and some people aboard had been stabbed. Reports indicated hijackers stabbed and killed pilots, flight attendants, and one or more passengers. According to the 9/11 Commission's final report, <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> had recently purchased multi-function hand tools and assorted Leatherman-type utility knives with locking blades, which were not forbidden to passengers at the time, but were not found among the possessions left behind by <b>the</b> <b>hijackers.</b> A flight attendant on Flight 11, a passenger on Flight 175, and passengers on Flight 93 said <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> had bombs, {{but one of the}} passengers said he thought the bombs were fake. The FBI found no traces of explosives at the crash sites, and the 9/11 Commission concluded that the bombs were probably fake.|$|E
5|$|The Pakistani negotiators {{inadvertently}} {{reveal the}} name of radio engineer Ali, whom <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> bring to the cockpit to use the radio for negotiations. Meanwhile, the Pakistani authorities try to stall for time. When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests the attendants, the terrorist leader chastises him; humiliated, the younger terrorist storms into the cockpit and shoots Ali, screaming wild threats over the radio. While negotiations with the Pakistani air controllers drag on, the negotiators slowly lose control of the situation, with <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> becoming more agitated by the minute.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>hijacker</b> {{then drove}} <b>the</b> truck {{at high speed}} into a {{pedestrian}} street, going about 500 m down Drottninggatan (Queen Street), one of Stockholm's main shopping streets, hitting pedestrians along the way. Witnesses said <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> attempted to target children as he zigzagged on the street. The attack ended when the truck rammed the Åhléns City department store {{on the corner of}} Drottninggatan and Mäster Samuelsgatan. The truck caught fire, but the flames were quickly doused by firefighters. <b>The</b> <b>hijacker</b> jumped out and fled the scene.|$|R

5|$|According {{to flight}} attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong, who {{contacted}} American Airlines during the hijacking, <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> had stabbed flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui and slashed {{the throat of}} passenger Daniel Lewin. Lewin, an American-Israeli Internet entrepreneur who understood Arabic, had served as {{an officer in the}} elite Sayeret Matkal special operations unit of the Israel Defense Forces. Lewin was seated in 9B, and Suqami was directly behind him in 10B. The 9/11 Commission suggested that Suqami may have stabbed and killed Lewin after he attempted to stop the hijacking. Lewin {{is believed to be the}} first fatality in the 9/11 attacks. During a four-minute call to the American Airlines operations center, Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, lack of access to the cockpit, and passenger injuries. She provided the seat locations of <b>the</b> <b>hijackers,</b> which later helped investigators to determine their identities.|$|E

50|$|As the {{survivors}} discuss finding water, {{a knock at}} the door is heard. Sugisaka opens it to find <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> lying on <b>the</b> ground with a big scar on his forehead. The survivors carry <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> inside and dress his wound. Tokiyasu then uses the rifle to force everyone out of the plane and locks himself safely inside, with <b>the</b> <b>hijacker.</b> Right after, Tokiyasu's screams are heard and the door swings open. Everyone rushes inside to find Tokiyasu dead, drained of all blood. <b>The</b> <b>hijacker</b> appears and carries Noriko off to the spaceship. At sunrise, Noriko is seen standing on a ridge. She speaks, but with the voice of the alien, the Gokemidoro. It is revealed that the Gokemidoro has invaded the earth, intending to eradicate the human race. Noriko then plunges off the ridge, shriveling into a cadaver.|$|R

Passenger Ergün Erköseoğlu said [...] "I didn't see any suspicious behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>hijacker.</b> Airplane took off and after 20 minutes later, captain announced that due to technical malfunction we would land in Italy instead of Istanbul". Aviation authorities said that after all the passengers had left the plane, police questioned <b>the</b> <b>hijacker.</b> Abazi said that he saw only one hijacker but had been told by a flight attendant that there were two hijackers on board. Istanbul Governor Muammer Güler reported that <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> Ekinci lied to the airliner's pilots that he had at least one accomplice.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> fired a shot, the CMG {{dispatched}} {{a team of}} NSG commandos to Amritsar via Adampur. Meanwhile, the negotiators were advised to continue talking to <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> to wear him down. At 23:00, <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> declared that he would blow up the aircraft if his demand was not met. The CMG then directed the NSG commandos and the negotiators to storm the plane. Over the next two hours, the team assessed the ground situation and planned the operation. At 01:00 on April 25, around 60 commandos of NSG's 52 Special Action Group surrounded and stormed <b>the</b> plane. <b>The</b> <b>hijacker</b> {{was surprised by the}} sudden entry of the commandos into the plane. Before he could react and fire, a commando shot at him with a silenced pistol. The operation ended in five minutes, at 01:05, without any casualty or injury to any hostage or further damage to the aircraft.|$|R
