25|$|Molecular cloning takes {{advantage}} {{of the fact that the}} chemical structure of DNA is fundamentally the same in all living organisms. Therefore, if any segment of DNA from any organism is inserted into a DNA segment containing the molecular sequences required for DNA replication, and the resulting recombinant DNA is introduced into the organism from which the replication sequences were obtained, then the foreign DNA will be replicated along with the host cell's DNA in the <b>transgenic</b> <b>organism.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first <b>transgenic</b> <b>organism</b> {{was created}} in 1974 when Annie Chang and Stanley Cohen {{expressed}} Staphylococcus aureus genes in Escherichia coli. In 1978, yeast cells were the first eukaryotic organisms to undergo gene transfer. Mouse cells were first transformed in 1979, followed by mouse embryos in 1980. Most {{of the very first}} transmutations were performed by microinjection of DNA directly into cells. Scientist were able to develop other methods to perform the transformations, such as incorporating transgenes into retroviruses and then infecting cells, using electroinfusion which takes advantage of an electric current to pass foreign DNA through the cell wall, biolistics which is the procedure of shooting DNA bullets into cells, and also delivering DNA into the egg that has just been fertilized.|$|E

2500|$|In {{its most}} precise usage, the term {{transgene}} describes {{a segment of}} DNA containing a gene sequence that has been isolated from one organism and is introduced into a different organism. [...] This non-native segment of DNA may either retain the ability to produce RNA or protein in the <b>transgenic</b> <b>organism</b> or alter the normal function of the transgenic organism's genetic code. In general, the DNA is incorporated into the organism's germ line. [...] For example, in higher vertebrates {{this can be accomplished}} by injecting the foreign DNA into the nucleus of a fertilized ovum. This technique is routinely used to introduce human disease genes or other genes of interest into strains of laboratory mice to study the function or pathology involved with that particular gene.|$|E
50|$|Position {{effect is}} also used to {{describe}} the variation of expression exhibited by identical transgenes that insert into different regions of a genome. In this case the difference in expression is often due to enhancers that regulate neighboring genes. These local enhancers can also affect the expression pattern of the transgene. Since each <b>transgenic</b> <b>organism</b> has the transgene in a different location each <b>transgenic</b> <b>organism</b> has the potential for a unique expression pattern.|$|E

50|$|The {{geographic}} and temporal {{scope of the}} regulatory debate regarding <b>transgenic</b> <b>organisms</b> and recombinant DNA technology is vast. Environmental risk assessments must weigh unquantifiable long-term risks against high and quantifiable short-term benefits. There is widespread concern amongst environmental groups, organic farmers {{and the international community}} that the introduction of <b>transgenic</b> <b>organisms</b> into local ecosystems may cause irreversible loss of biodiversity when the new synthetic strains become predominant. Further concern comes from members of the medical community who warn of the risk that the antibiotics used in the production of many GEOs may give rise to more resistant strains of bacteria. While the scientific community generally acknowledges the possibility of these risks, the scenarios are hard to quantify, particularly in a Risk-Cost Benefit Analysis (RCBA) model commonly used in public policy.|$|R

50|$|The pGLO plasmid is an {{engineered}} plasmid used in biotechnology as a vector {{for creating}} genetically modified organisms. The plasmid contains several reporter genes, most notably {{for the green}} fluorescent protein (GFP) and the ampicillin resistance gene. GFP was isolated from the jelly fish Aequorea victoria. Because it shares a bidirectional promoter with a gene for metabolizing arabinose, the GFP gene is expressed {{in the presence of}} arabinose, which makes the <b>transgenic</b> <b>organism</b> express its fluorescence under UV light. GFP can be induced in bacteria containing the pGLO plasmid by growing them on +arabinose plates.|$|E
50|$|As only {{a single}} cell is {{transformed}} with genetic material, the organism must be regenerated from that single cell. As bacteria consist of a single cell and reproduce clonally regeneration is not necessary. In plants this is accomplished {{through the use of}} tissue culture. In animals it is necessary to ensure that the inserted DNA is present in the embryonic stem cells. Selectable markers are used to easily differentiate transformed from untransformed cells. These markers are usually present in the <b>transgenic</b> <b>organism,</b> although a number of strategies have been developed that can remove the selectable marker from the mature transgenic plant.|$|E

A year later Rudolf Jaenisch created a transgenic mouse by introducing foreign DNA into its embryo, making it the world’s first transgenic animal. [...] These achievements led to concerns in the scientific community about potential risks from genetic engineering, which were first discussed in depth at the Asilomar Conference in 1975. One of the main recommendations from this meeting was that government oversight of recombinant DNA research should be established until the technology was deemed safe.|$|E
5000|$|Genes from a GMO may pass {{to another}} {{organism}} {{just like an}} endogenous gene. The process is known as outcrossing and can occur in any new open-pollinated crop variety. Introduced traits potentially can cross into neighboring plants of the same or closely related species through three different types of gene flow: crop-to-crop, crop-to-weedy, and crop-to-wild. In crop-to-crop, genetic information from a genetically modified crop is transferred to a non-genetically modified crop. Crop-to-weedy transfer refers to the transfer of genetically modified material to a weed, and crop-to-wild indicates transfer from a genetically modified crop to a wild, undomesticated plant and/or crop. There are concerns that the spread of genes from modified organisms to unmodified relatives could produce species of weeds resistant to herbicides that could contaminate nearby non-genetically modified crops, or could disrupt the ecosystem, This is primarily a concern if the <b>transgenic</b> <b>organism</b> has a significant survival capacity and can increase in frequency and persist in natural populations.
