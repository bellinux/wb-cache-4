5|$|Biographers Fraser and Navarro {{wrote that}} Eva Perón {{has often been}} {{credited}} with gaining the right <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for Argentine women. While Eva did make radio addresses in support of women's suffrage and also published articles in her Democracia newspaper asking male Peronists to support women's right <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> ultimately the ability to grant to women the right <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> was beyond Eva's powers. Fraser and Navarro claim that Eva's actions were limited to supporting a bill introduced by one of her supporters, Eduardo Colom, a bill that was eventually dropped.|$|E
5|$|By the mid 20th century, in some European countries, {{women still}} lacked some {{significant}} rights. Feminists {{in these countries}} continued to fight for voting rights. In Switzerland, women gained the right <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in federal elections in 1971; but in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women obtained the right <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced {{to do so by}} the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. In Liechtenstein, women were given the right <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> by the women's suffrage referendum of 1984. Three prior referendums held in 1968, 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure women's right <b>to</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E

30|$|For {{voters that}} live in the country that {{provides}} the most encouraging policies to enhance immigrants’ political participation (the Netherlands), Turkish and Islamic identifications relate positively <b>to</b> local <b>voting</b> likelihood. This corresponds to the theoretical expectations. These expectations are best reflected for Islamic identification, which relates negatively <b>to</b> <b>voting</b> in the country that has the least encouraging policies, namely Austria, while Islamic identification relates positively <b>to</b> <b>voting</b> in countries with the more encouraging policies, namely Germany and the Netherlands. The pattern is less clear when it comes to Turkish identification, since it relates positively <b>to</b> <b>voting</b> in Austria (though not significantly) and in the Netherlands, the countries that differ the most when it comes to policies surrounding the political participation of immigrants. Therefore only partial support for hypothesis 2 is found.|$|R
5|$|On August 27, 2013, Hickenlooper {{asked the}} Colorado Supreme Court to clarify if a voter had <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for recall in order <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for a {{replacement}} candidate.

On August 28, the Supreme Court ruled that a voter did not have <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> to recall in order <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> {{for a replacement}}, but that the Senators could only be recalled by a majority vote. Secretary of State Gessler announced that Brooks did not have sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot, leaving only Republican opponents on the ballot.|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} has arisen is whether a Singaporean who votes {{in a foreign country}} where the right <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> is not {{exclusive}} to nationals of that country is disqualified from voting in a Singapore election. For instance, the United Kingdom permits citizens of Commonwealth countries, including Singapore, who are resident in the UK and have leave to remain there (or do not require such leave) to register <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in general elections and local government elections. When queried, the Elections Department stated that since suffrage in the UK is not exclusive to British citizens, Singaporeans who vote there are still eligible <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in Singapore. However, this interpretation of the PEA has not been tested in court.|$|E
