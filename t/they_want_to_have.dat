5|$|Wood {{shoots a}} film with Lugosi outside his home. When Wood and company attend the premiere for Bride of the Monster, an angry mob chases {{them out of}} the theater. Lugosi passes away, leaving Wood without a star. Wood convinces his landlord, a church leader named Reynolds, that funding Wood's script for Grave Robbers from Outer Space would result in a box office success, and {{generate}} enough money for Reynolds' dream project. Dr. Tom Mason, O'Hara's chiropractor, is chosen to be Lugosi's stand-in for resembling Lugosi. Wood and the Baptists have conflicts over the title and content of the script which <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> changed to Plan 9 from Outer Space, along with Ed's B movie directing style, his casting decisions and his transvestism. Wood leaves the set to go to the nearest bar, where he encounters his idol, Orson Welles. Filming for Plan 9 finishes with Ed taking action against his producers. After attending the premiere of Plan 9, Wood and O'Hara go to Las Vegas to get married.|$|E
25|$|On 21 April 2015 40 masked {{and armed}} ethnic Albanians wearing the {{insignia}} of Kosovo Liberation Army {{took control of}} the Gosince border post. Threatening to kill the four on-duty police officers unless they leave the border area immediately, they said that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their own state and that they do not accept the Ohrid Agreements. After a few hours, Macedonian forces regained control of the village.|$|E
25|$|At the end {{the premiere}} episode of the program's sixth season, it was {{revealed}} that Amita has accepted Charlie's proposal. The issue was skirted throughout the episode, as the two were waiting until Amita officially received permission from her parents. He and Amita discuss the number of children that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> and they both decide that they may need to participate in the Big Brother/Big Sister program for some practical experience before having children. He and Amita attempt to find a wedding date that is suited to their and their families' schedules; Alan suggests that they should take his and Margaret's anniversary date as Charlie and Amita's date. Charlie and Amita have since pushed the date forward as his academic fantasy has come to light, being a visiting professor at Cambridge University. In the season finale, after the wedding ceremony presided over by Larry, he is happy but worries about disconnecting with Don and offers to have the garage renovated into a guest house for his father. He toasts his friends and family and amazes at the prospect of staying in England with his wife.|$|E

500|$|... "Greatest Hits" [...] {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} for married couple Rose and Bernard since the late second season and fans welcomed the recurring characters' return. [...] The writers cited the actors' other projects {{as a reason for}} their absence. [...] Additionally, it was feared that fans would complain if they appeared, when many actors with star billing had received limited screentime in the early third season. [...] The writers also commented that {{they do not want to}} have the couple on the show if they are just going to be standing in the background; <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Rose and Bernard in the show with interesting storylines.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began on}} November 2010, taking place entirely in New York City {{on a budget}} of $85million ($75million after tax rebates). Production {{designer}} Kristi Zea visited several upscale hotels and high-rise residences to research the design elements to incorporate into the opulent surroundings of the tower and Shaw's penthouse. Zea created an amalgamation of the elements she saw during her research to create a sophisticated lobby design for the tower. For Shaw's penthouse, Zea took inspiration from a top-floor apartment in the Trump International Hotel and Tower at Central Park West in Columbus Circle. Zea populated the apartment {{with an assortment of}} art pieces to represent Shaw's status, based on specific artists and works that Ratner suggested. Zea decided to use modern-classic reproduction designs by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Francis Bacon, Cy Twombly, and Andy Warhol. Explaining her decision, Zea said [...] "These days, it seems wealthy people want to have wall power. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> art on their walls that means something and shows people, just like a car, that, 'I'm rich, I'm smart and I know what I'm doing.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Jews {{came here}} 3,000 {{years ago and}} this is the cradle of Jewish civilization. Jews are the only people in history who kept their loyalty to their {{identity}} and their land throughout the 2,000 years of exile, and no doubt that {{they have the right to}} have their place among nations—not only historically but also geographically. As to the Palestinians, who are the descendants of those Arabs who migrated in the last 200 years, they have the right, if <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their own state ... but not at the expense of the state of Israel.|$|E
2500|$|... “A [...] made in El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua {{concluded}} that women living with HIV, and whose health providers {{knew about it}} at the time of pregnancy, were six times more likely to experience forced or coerced sterilization in those countries. In addition, most of these women reported that health providers told them that living with HIV cancelled their right to choose the number and spacing of the children <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> as well as the right to choose the contraceptive method of their choice; provided misleading information about the consequences for their health and that of their children and denied them access to treatments that reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission in order to coerce them into sterilization.|$|E
2500|$|Research on how gender {{stereotypes}} affect adolescent {{sexuality is}} important because researchers believe it can show sexual health educators how they can improve their programming to more accurately attend {{to the needs of}} adolescents. For example, studies have shown how the social constructed idea that girls are [...] "supposed to" [...] not be interested in sex have actually made it more difficult for girls to have their voices heard when <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> safer sex. At the same time, sexual educators continuously tell girls to make choices that will lead them to safer sex, but don’t always tell them ‘how’ they should go about doing this. Instances such as these show the difficulties that can arise from not exploring how society’s perspective of gender and sexuality affect adolescent sexuality.|$|E
50|$|The {{necessity}} came {{then when}} the shows rating was somewhat failing. While both hosts remains in {{the four corners of}} the studio, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> interviews outside <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a wider scope or coverage. The show's system however was not fully modified but was just introducing new portions.|$|R

2500|$|Rotter (1975) {{cautioned that}} internality and {{externality}} represent two {{ends of a}} continuum, not an either/or typology. Internals tend to attribute outcomes of events to their own control. People who have {{internal locus of control}} believe that the outcomes of their actions are results of their own abilities. Internals believe that their hard work would lead them to obtain positive outcomes. They also believe that every action has its consequence, which makes them accept the fact that things happen and it depends on them if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> control over it or not. Externals attribute outcomes of events to external circumstances. People with an external locus of control tend to believe that the things which happen in their lives are out of their control, and even that their own actions are a result of external factors, such as fate, luck, the influence of powerful others (such as doctors, the police, or government officials) and/or a belief that the world is too complex for one to predict or successfully control its outcomes. Such people tend to blame others rather than themselves for their lives' outcomes. It should not be thought, however, that internality is linked exclusively with attribution to effort and externality with attribution to luck (as Weiner's work – see below – [...] makes clear). This has obvious implications for differences between internals and externals in terms of their achievement motivation, suggesting that internal locus is linked with higher levels of need for achievement. Due to their locating control outside themselves, externals tend to feel they have less control over their fate. People with an external locus of control tend to be more stressed and prone to clinical depression.|$|E

6000|$|Your Lordships see {{the orders}} of the Company.
