40|$|The highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} subtype H 5 N 1 (HPAI H 5 N 1) is a worldwide zoonotic infectious disease, threatening humans, poultry and wild birds. The role of wild {{birds in the}} spread of HPAI H 5 N 1 has previously been investigated by comparing disease spread patterns with bird migration routes. However, the different roles that the southward autumn and northward spring migration might play in virus transmission have hardly been explored. Using direction analysis, we analyze HPAI H 5 N 1 <b>transmission</b> <b>directions</b> and angular concentration of currently circulating viral clades, and compare these with waterfowl seasonal migration directions along major waterfowl flyways. Out of 22 HPAI H 5 N 1 <b>transmission</b> <b>directions,</b> 18 had both a southward direction and a relatively high concentration. Differences between disease transmission and waterfowl migration directions were significantly smaller for autumn than for spring migration. The four northward <b>transmission</b> <b>directions</b> were found along Asian flyways, where the initial epicenter of the virus was located. We suggest waterfowl first picked up the virus from East Asia, then {{brought it to the}} north via spring migration, and then spread it to other parts of world mainly by autumn migration. We emphasize waterfowl autumn migration plays a relatively important role in HPAI H 5 N 1 transmission compared to spring migration. </p...|$|R

50|$|In many respects, CH was a crude system, both {{in theory}} and in {{comparison}} to other systems of the era. This is especially true when CH is compared to its German counterpart, the Freya. Freya operated on shorter wavelengths, in the 2.5 to 2.3 m (120 to 130 MHz) band, allowing it to be broadcast from a much smaller antenna. This meant that Freya {{did not have to}} use the two-part structure of CH with a floodlight transmission, and could instead send its signal in a more tightly focused beam like a searchlight. This greatly reduced the amount of energy needed to be broadcast, as a much smaller volume was being filled with the <b>transmission.</b> <b>Direction</b> finding was accomplished simply by turning the antenna, which was small enough to make this relatively easy to arrange. Additionally, the higher frequency of the signal allowed higher resolution, which aided operational effectiveness. However, Freya had a shorter maximum range of 100 mi, and could not accurately determine altitude.|$|E
50|$|At the {{physical}} layer, DSI specifies a high-speed differential signaling point-to-point serial bus. This bus includes one high speed clock lane {{and one or}} more data lanes. Each lane is carried on two wires (due to differential signaling). All lanes travel from the DSI host to the DSI device, except for the first data lane (lane 0), which is capable of a bus turnaround (BTA) operation that allows it to reverse <b>transmission</b> <b>direction.</b> When more than one lane is used, they are used in parallel to transmit data, with each sequential byte in the stream traveling on the next lane. That is, if 4 lanes are being used, 4 bits are transmitted simultaneously, one on each lane. The link operates in either low power (LP) mode or high speed (HS) mode. In low power mode, the high speed clock is disabled and signal clocking information {{is embedded in the}} data. In this mode, the data rate is insufficient to drive a display, but is usable for sending configuration information and commands. High speed mode enables the high speed clock (at frequencies from tens of megahertz to over one gigahertz) that acts as the bit clock for the data lanes. Clock speeds vary by the requirements of the display. High speed mode is still designed to reduce power usage due to its low voltage signaling and parallel transfer ability.|$|E

40|$|Cooperative {{relaying}} (CR) is {{a promising}} technique to provide spatial diversity by combining multiple signals from source and relay stations. In the present paper, the impact {{and use of}} the asymmetric property in bi-directional CR under asymmetric traffic conditions are discussed assuming that CR involves one communication pair and one relay station in a time division duplex (TDD) system. The asymmetric property means that the average communication quality differs for each <b>transmission</b> <b>direction</b> because of the difference in signal power between the combined signals for each direction. First, numerical results show the asymmetric property of bi-directional CR. Next, in order to evaluate the impact of the asymmetric property, the optimal relay position and resource allocation are compared to those in simple multi-hop relaying, which does not have the asymmetric property. Numerical results show that, in order to maximize the overall quality of bi-directional communication, the optimal relay position in CR depends on the offered traffic ratio, which is defined as the traffic ratio of each <b>transmission</b> <b>direction,</b> while the offered traffic ratio does not affect the optimal relay position in multi-hop relaying. Finally, the asymmetric property is used to enhance the overall quality. Specifically, a high overall quality can be achieved by, for example, opportunistically switching to the <b>transmission</b> <b>direction</b> with higher quality. Under asymmetric traffic conditions, weighted proportionally fair scheduling (WPFS), which is proposed in the context of downlink scheduling in a cellular network, is applied to <b>transmission</b> <b>direction</b> switching. Numerical results reveal that WPFS provides a high overall quality and that the quality ratio is similar to the offered traffic ratio...|$|E

30|$|The {{geographic}} {{routing protocols}} mentioned above always forward the packets to each intermediate intersection {{to make the}} routing decision. Lee et al.[15] noted the fact that packets do not necessarily need to stop at each junction if the <b>transmission</b> <b>direction</b> does not change and proposed GpsrJ+. The segment to which the packet will be forwarded is pre-computed. If the <b>transmission</b> <b>direction</b> does not change, the forwarder simply bypasses the junction node and forwards the packet to its furthest neighbor; otherwise, it will forward to the junction node. However, GpsrJ+ is not suitable for delay-sensitive applications or actual city maps, since it assumes the road as a simple straight line while the actual city map has more complicated roads. Afterwards, Lee et al. proposed another protocol called TO-GO[16], which incorporates geographic routing with opportunistic forwarding. TO-GO utilizes the two-hop information to make an advanced {{decision on whether to}} bypass the junction.|$|E

This is a nontrivial extension of the DMT because it requires consideration of the cooperation (or lack thereof) of relay nodes, the traffic pattern and the time allocation between the forward and reverse traffic directions. We then use this tradeoff to compare the DMTs of traditional time-division multihop (TDMH) and network coding (NC). Our main results are the derivations of the DMT for both TDMH and NC. This shows, surprisingly, that if relay nodes collaborate NC does not always have a better DMT than TDMH since {{it is difficult to}} simultaneously achieve bidirectional transmit diversity for both source nodes. In fact, for certain traffic patterns NC can have a worse DMT due to suboptimal time allocation between the forward and reverse <b>transmission</b> <b>directions.</b> I...|$|R
