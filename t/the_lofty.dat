5|$|A 1997 report {{stated that}} Messers Run {{was a poor}} site for angling {{upstream}} of <b>the</b> <b>Lofty</b> Reservoir. The same report stated that the stream was an excellent site for angling between <b>the</b> <b>Lofty</b> Reservoir and the Blue Head Reservoir. Additionally, the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 308 are in the stream's watershed. These state game lands contain 432 hectares of forested land.|$|E
5|$|Messers Run is {{infertile}} and acidic upstream of <b>the</b> <b>Lofty</b> Reservoir. The stream has {{the potential}} to be affected by acid precipitation in this part of it. The stream also has these attributes from <b>the</b> <b>Lofty</b> Reservoir downstream to the Blue Head Reservoir and from the Blue Head Reservoir downstream to the mouth.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the {{population}} {{density of the}} watershed of Messers Run upstream of <b>the</b> <b>Lofty</b> Reservoir was 140 people per square mile (54 people per square kilometer). The population density of the watershed between <b>the</b> <b>Lofty</b> and Blue Head Reservoirs was 80 people per square mile (31 people per square kilometer). The population density of the watershed downstream of the Blue Head Reservoir was 52 people per square mile (20 people per square kilometer).|$|E

5|$|A {{reservoir}} {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Lofty</b> Reservoir is situated on Messers Run. It {{is owned by}} the Pennsylvania Game Commission and is used as a supply of drinking water. Additionally, the Blue Head Reservoir is in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{species of}} fish inhabit Messers Run. These include a highly {{substantial}} population of brook trout. Upstream of <b>the</b> <b>Lofty</b> Reservoir, there are two {{species of fish}} inhabiting the stream: brook trout, eastern blacknose dace. The 1990 survey observed these two species as well as white suckers and pumpkinseeds. Three species of fish inhabit the stream between <b>the</b> <b>Lofty</b> Reservoir and the Blue Head Reservoir. These species are brook trout, brown trout, and blacknose dace. Six species of fish inhabit the stream below the Blue Head Reservoir: brook trout, blacknose dace, tessellated darters, brown trout, white suckers, and sculpins. However, only the first three species were observed during the 1990 survey of the stream.|$|E
5|$|The pH of Messers Run between <b>the</b> <b>Lofty</b> Reservoir and the Blue Head Reservoir is 6.6. The {{concentration}} of alkalinity in {{this portion of}} the stream is 4 milligrams per liter and the total water hardness is 18 milligrams per liter. The pH of the stream below the Blue Head Reservoir is 6.6. The {{concentration of}} alkalinity {{in this part of the}} stream is 5 milligrams per liter and the water hardness is 13 milligrams per liter.|$|E

5|$|The pH of Messers Run {{upstream}} of <b>the</b> <b>Lofty</b> Reservoir is 6.3. The total {{concentration of}} alkalinity {{in this part}} of the stream is 3 milligrams per liter. These values are similar to those measured in a similar area during a 1990 survey of the stream. The concentration of water hardness {{in this part of}} the stream is 47 milligrams per liter. A 1997 report noted that this value was very high considering the concentration of alkalinity.|$|E
5|$|Syrgiannes was {{dissatisfied}} with the new arrangements, feeling {{that he had not}} been sufficiently rewarded for his support of Andronikos III. He also resented the greater favour shown by the young emperor to Kantakouzenos, and developed a fierce rivalry with the latter. Furthermore, chroniclers also report a story whereby Andronikos III attempted to seduce Syrgiannes's wife. In December 1321, Syrgiannes switched sides, fleeing to Constantinople. Rewarded with <b>the</b> <b>lofty</b> title of megas doux, he convinced Andronikos II to resume the war against his grandson. In July 1322, however, another agreement was reached between the two Andronikoi, which left Syrgiannes in an awkward position. His own schemes having failed, he began plotting to murder the aged Andronikos II and seize the throne for himself. The plot was foiled, however, and Syrgiannes was sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|The south–west Monsoon from June to September {{accounts}} {{for most of}} the rainfall in the region. The Arabian Sea branch of the south-west monsoon hits the Western Ghats along the coastal state of Kerala and moves northwards along the Konkan coast with precipitation on coastal areas, west of the Western Ghats. <b>The</b> <b>lofty</b> Western Ghats prevent the winds from reaching the Deccan Plateau - hence the leeward region (the region that deprived of winds) receives very little rainfall. The Bay of Bengal branch of south-west monsoon heads toward north east India, picking up moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The Coramandel coast does not receive much rainfall from the south-west monsoon due to the shape of the land. Tamil Nadu and southeast Andhra Pradesh receive rains from the north–east Monsoon. The north-east monsoon take place from November to early March when the surface high-pressure system is strongest. The North Indian Ocean tropical cyclones occur throughout the year in Bay of Bengal and Arabian sea bringing devastating winds and heavy rainfall.|$|E

5|$|Undeterred, Bruce {{was elected}} Chairman {{of the newly}} formed FAO Council in November 1947, working once more with John Boyd Orr, now Secretary-General of the FAO. Acute {{shortages}} of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in Europe, and the international food supply system was under serious strain after the devastation of the war. Bruce and the council worked in these years to distribute fertiliser and agricultural machinery, as well as improve nutrition, especially in less developed nations. More {{than two-thirds of the}} world was undernourished in 1949 and Bruce felt it imperative for the Council to bring these stark facts to the developed nations. A landmark agreement on technical aid between the FAO and the United Nations was reached in November 1949, and the FAO received the funding and logistical capacity to act on the food shortage crisis and the problems of poor nutrition in the developing world. Bruce and the FAO were successful in these years in supporting the recovery of world agricultural output. By 1951 this had exceeded pre-war levels, and general levels of nutrition were rising internationally, but by the time Bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough {{to keep pace with the}} post-war population boom. The Council faced major obstacles in supporting the improvement of conditions in the developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence, post-colonial and Cold War conflicts multiplied. Frustrated by continuing world conflict and the lack of commitment from the developed world to support <b>the</b> <b>lofty</b> but very difficult aims of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr resigned from the FAO disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems.|$|E
