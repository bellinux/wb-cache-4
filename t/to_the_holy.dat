50|$|Mr. Inagaki sent {{a letter}} about {{receiving}} the ashes of Buddha <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foreign minister, Shuzo Aoki. Mr. Aoki immediately commanded all of the chiefs of Buddhist sects (13 sects and 56 sub sects) to prepare <b>to</b> receive <b>the</b> <b>holy</b> ashes. They held a conference and decided <b>to</b> receive <b>the</b> <b>holy</b> ashes. They organized a mission in order <b>to</b> receive <b>the</b> <b>holy</b> ashes in June 1900. The mission visited Thailand and received <b>the</b> <b>holy</b> ashes from King Chulalongkorn at the Roya Palace in Bangkok on 15 June 1900. When they promised King Chulalongkorn {{to build a new}} temple not belonging to any Buddhist sect in order <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> <b>holy</b> ashes, King Chulalongkorn gave a gold-bronze statue of Buddha which was made a thousand years ago and which was a national treasure in Thailand to Japan as a main statue of Buddha in the new temple. After the mission brought back <b>the</b> <b>holy</b> ashes <b>to</b> Japan, <b>the</b> <b>holy</b> ashes were kept at Myohoin temple in Kyoto temporarily. The representatives from each Buddhist sect in Japan conferred about the new temple in order <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> <b>holy</b> ashes.

Conceding to their request, Pope Gregory XVI established Mangalore as a separate Vicariate on 17 February 1845 under the Verapoly Carmelites.
