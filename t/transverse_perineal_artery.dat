40|$|Background. Perineal {{pressure}} due to bicycle riding {{has been}} associated with erectile dysfunction. We developed a novel method to measure the occlusive force exerted over the <b>perineal</b> <b>arteries</b> and determined <b>perineal</b> <b>artery</b> occlusion by a variety of seat designs. Methods. Doppler ultrasonography facilitated <b>perineal</b> <b>artery</b> localization and determination of the force required for <b>perineal</b> <b>artery</b> occlusion in 20 healthy men. Flexiforce® sensors were affixed over the proximal and distal aspects of the <b>perineal</b> <b>arteries</b> bilaterally. Individuals completed bicycle rides in the road- and stationary-settings with six distinct seat designs, including those with and without an anterior “nose. ”Results. The occlusion time proportion of the total ride time was calculated for each trial. The overall occlusion time proportion was 0. 59 (95 % CI [0. 45 – 0. 73]) across all seats and settings. The “no-nose” bicycle seat and the stationary-setting demonstrated significantly lower occlusion proportion times than the traditional nose bicycle seat and road-setting, respectively. However, all bicycle seats yielded an occlusion time proportion of 0. 41 or greater. Discussion. Our method of real-time, non-invasive force measurement localized to the <b>perineal</b> <b>arteries</b> may be used to validate future bicycle seat design. It also underscores the significant risk of <b>perineal</b> <b>artery</b> insufficiency in men who are avid bicyclists. This risk may be minimized by using newer “no-nose” bicycle seats...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aimed {{to show the}} {{arterial}} blood supply of the udder of the Egyptian native breed of goat (Baladi goat) {{to be used as}} a guide during mastectomy and other surgical interferences. The study was carried out on the udder of twelve apparently healthy adult female Egyptian Baladi goats. Four goats were used for mastectomy, one specimen was used for radiography and the other specimens were subjected to gum-milk latex injection to clarify the origin, course and distribution of the main arteries supplying the udder. The results revealed that the udder of goat was supplied by the external pudendal artery and dorsal labial and mammary branch of the ventral <b>perineal</b> <b>artery.</b> The course of the external pudendal artery through the inguinal canal before reaching the base of the udder, as well as that of the dorsal labial and mammary branch of the ventral <b>perineal</b> <b>artery</b> in the <b>perineal</b> region, were briefly described to determine the appropriate site for ligation of these vessels before mastectomy. Moreover, the arterial interconnection between the two halves of the udder was emphasized to be highlighted during unilateral mastectomy. Vascular ligation of the main blood vessels supplying the udder on the basis of the anatomical description provided less traumatic surgery and reduced the severity of the blood loss...|$|R

40|$|The pudendal thigh flap is a sensate {{fasciocutaneous}} flap {{based on}} the terminal branches of the superficial <b>perineal</b> <b>artery,</b> which {{is a continuation of}} the internal pudendal artery. Several authors have reported using this axial patterned flap in a bilateral fashion to reconstruct the vagina, mostly in patients with vaginal atresia. The technique is simple, safe, and reliable, and no stents or dilators are required. The reconstructed vagina has a natural angle and is sensate. The donor site in the groin carl be closed primarily with an inconspicuous scar. The distinct advantages of this flap widen its indications to several other pathologies. In this article, the authors report on the bilateral use of the flap to reconstruct a vagina in patients with congenital atresia (n = 8) and after oncological resection (n = 5). Furthermore, the versatility of this island flap is also demonstrated by its use in a unilateral fashion in patients with recurrent or complex rectovaginal fistulas (n = 4) and in two patients with a defect of the posterior urethra in a heavily scarred perineum. All 31 pudendal thigh flaps survived completely. Some wound dehiscence was observed in two patients. Two other patients required a minor correction at the introitus of the vagina. The functional outcome was excellent in all patients, despite the presence of some hair growth in the flaps. This article discusses the expanding indications of this versatile flap and the refinements in operative technique...|$|R
40|$|To {{describe}} the various patterns of normal sphincter anatomy as seen at endoanal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging {{and to assess}} sex- and age-related variations in {{the dimensions of the}} anal sphincter to refine the diagnosis of sphincter disorders. Endoanal MR imaging (1. 5 T) was performed in 100 healthy volunteers (50 women, 50 men) evenly distributed between ages 20 and 85 years. The essential anatomic structures were evaluated, and various patterns in men and women were recorded. The thickness of the anal sphincter muscles and the length of the anal canal were measured, and age- and sex-related correlations were studied. Sex-related differences included a significantly shorter external sphincter in women than in men both laterally (mean, 27. 1 mm +/- 5. 4 vs 28. 6 mm +/- 4. 3; P: <. 05) and anteriorly (mean, 14. 0 mm +/- 3. 0 vs 27. 0 mm +/- 53. 0; P: <. 051). The superficial <b>transverse</b> <b>perineal</b> muscle is located more superiorly in women than in men. The central perineal tendon in men is a central muscular insertion point; in women, it represents an area where muscle fibers imbricate. Age-related variations included a significant decrease in the thickness of the external sphincter in men (P: <. 01). Significant decrease in the thickness of the longitudinal muscle and increase in the thickness of the internal sphincter were noted in both sexes (P: <. 01). High-spatial-resolution endoanal MR imaging provides excellent visualization of pelvic floor structures. Severe atrophy as it occurs in incontinent patients should be differentiated from physiologic, age-related thinning of the external sphincter and longitudinal muscl...|$|R
