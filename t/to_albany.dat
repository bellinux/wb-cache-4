5|$|By 1926, {{however, the}} Buffalo <b>to</b> <b>Albany</b> section of NY5 was {{relocated}} onto the Genesee Road alignment, replacing NY5A. NY5's former, more southerly alignment was redesignated as NY7. In 1927, {{the establishment of}} the U.S. Highway System created more numbering changes. US20, which mainly followed the Yellowstone Trail elsewhere in the country, was designated in New York along NY5 southwest of Hamburg and east of Albany and along old NY7 from Skaneateles <b>to</b> <b>Albany.</b> Between the towns of Hamburg and Avon, the new US20 used an even more southerly alignment, running via East Aurora and Warsaw. This truncated both ends of NY5 to Athol Springs (south of Buffalo in the town of Hamburg) in the west, and <b>to</b> <b>Albany</b> in the east.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, {{following}} {{what other}} states did, New York began to assign route numbers to its main thoroughfares. The Albany to Buffalo {{portion of the}} Yellowstone Trail, which ran through the cities of Syracuse and Utica, was assigned the number NY5A. The portion of the Yellowstone Trail southwest of Buffalo and east of Albany became part of NY5, which bypassed Syracuse and Utica to the south. The Buffalo <b>to</b> <b>Albany</b> portion of NY5's original alignment used a new road, Broadway Road, from Buffalo to Avon and the old Cherry Valley Turnpike alignment from Skaneateles <b>to</b> <b>Albany.</b> In between Avon and Skaneateles, NY5 and NY5A overlapped.|$|E

5|$|Angered by the French surrender, {{and unhappy}} with British {{policies}} that affected them, an Ottawa chief named Pontiac organized 18 Native American tribes that attacked British {{military and civilian}} settlements beginning in April 1763.

5|$|Most {{of modern}} NY144 was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY10 when {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924. NY10 joined what is now NY144 at Coeymans and followed it north through Bethlehem <b>to</b> <b>Albany,</b> where NY10 continued into the city on modern NY32. When U.S. Highways were first posted in New York in 1927, all of NY10 south of Albany became part of US9W. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, US9W was realigned through the towns of New Baltimore and Coeymans to use modern NY144 instead. At the same time, the portion of what is now US9W from New Baltimore <b>to</b> <b>Albany</b> was designated as NY144. The alignments of US9W and NY144 north of New Baltimore were flipped in April1935.|$|E
5|$|Part of modern-day NY311 {{from the}} NY292 {{intersection}} to the route's ending terminus was {{once part of}} the Philipstown Turnpike.

5|$|Albany's {{other major}} exports during the 18th and 19th centuries were furs, wheat, meat, and lumber; by 1865, there were almost 4,000 saw mills in the Albany {{area and the}} Albany Lumber District was the largest lumber market in the nation. The city was also home {{to a number of}} banks. The Bank of Albany (1792–1861) was the second {{chartered}} bank in New York. The city was the original home of the Albank (founded in 1820 as the Albany Savings Bank), KeyBank (founded in 1825 as the Commercial Bank of Albany), and Norstar Bank (founded as the State Bank of Albany in 1803). American Express was founded in Albany in 1850 as an express mail business. In 1871, the northwestern portion of Albany—west from Magazine Street—was annexed to the neighboring town of Guilderland after the town of Watervliet refused annexation of said territory. In return for this loss, portions of Bethlehem and Watervliet were added <b>to</b> <b>Albany.</b> Part of the land annexed to Guilderland was ceded back <b>to</b> <b>Albany</b> in 1910, setting up the current western border.|$|E
5|$|En route <b>to</b> <b>Albany,</b> {{the ship}} {{carrying}} Montgomery up the Hudson River ran aground near Clermont Manor, {{seat of the}} politically powerful Livingston family. While the ship was refloated, the Livingstons played host to the officers who were aboard the vessel. Montgomery was at this time introduced to Robert Livingston's 20-year-old daughter Janet. While it has never transpired exactly what happened between them at this time, Janet noticed that the young Montgomery was not with the regiment (having been given leave to return to England early) when it returned to New York.|$|E
5|$|In 1794 a state road, Genesee Road, {{was built}} from Utica {{west to the}} Genesee River. That year a {{contract}} was awarded to the Mohawk Turnpike and Bridge Company to extend the road northeast <b>to</b> <b>Albany,</b> and in 1798 it was extended. The Seneca Turnpike was key to Utica's development, replacing a worn footpath with a paved road. The village became a rest and supply area along the Mohawk River for goods and the many people moving through Western New York {{to and from the}} Great Lakes.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature {{created a}} system of {{unsigned}} legislative routes across the state of New York. Two of the routes created at this time were Route7, which extended from the Pennsylvania state line south of Binghamton <b>to</b> <b>Albany</b> via Oneonta, Cobleskill, Berne, and New Scotland, and Route24, a highway extending from the east bank of the Hudson River in Rensselaer to the Massachusetts state line near Mount Lebanon by way of Averill Park and Nassau. In the vicinity of Rensselaer, Route21 was routed on 3rd Avenue, 3rd Avenue Extension, North Greenbush Road, and West Sand Lake Road.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, UMBC {{posted a}} 5–1 conference mark {{to achieve the}} America East regular season conference championship. The {{following}} year, the Retrievers defeated Binghamton and Albany in the America East tournament for the conference championship, and Zimmerman made his tenth appearance {{as a head coach}} in the NCAA tournament. He was named the 2006 America East Coach of the Year. In 2007, UMBC again advanced past Binghamton before falling <b>to</b> <b>Albany</b> in the America East championship game, and secured another berth in the NCAA tournament. There, they upset seventh-seeded Maryland in the first round for the school's first appearance in the NCAA quarterfinals.|$|E
5|$|Planning for {{the route}} {{began in the}} 1950s, but the first segment between Wattle Grove and Cloverdale was not opened until 1980. Over the next five years, the highway was {{extended}} north to Great Eastern Highway and south <b>to</b> <b>Albany</b> Highway, and a discontinuous section was constructed north of the Swan River. In 1988 the Redcliffe Bridge linked these sections, and three years later, Reid Highway became the northern terminus. The next major works on the highway, between 2003 and 2005, extended the highway south to Thomas Road.|$|E

5|$|The {{automobile}} allowed {{people to}} quickly travel long distances {{and a way}} to mark routes became needed. One early means of marking routes was the establishment of various auto trail associations in the 1910s. These associations selected good quality roads and marked them with symbols or colors on telephone poles. Most of legislative Route6 eventually became part of the Yellowstone Trail, a cross-country auto trail established in 1912 that ran from Washington to Massachusetts. In New York, the trail used modern US20 from Pennsylvania to Silver Creek, most of modern NY5 from Silver Creek <b>to</b> <b>Albany,</b> and modern US20 again from Albany to Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The {{segment of}} modern NY32 between Albany and Mechanicville was {{designated}} {{as part of}} NY6 in 1924. From Mechanicville to Hudson Falls, the current routing of NY32 became part of NY30. By 1926, the portion {{of what is now}} NY32 from Harriman to Newburgh was designated NY58. From Newburgh <b>to</b> <b>Albany,</b> NY32 remained unnumbered at the time. When U.S. Routes were first assigned in New York in 1927, the portion of NY6 from Albany to Waterford was designated as the northernmost portion of US9W. In Waterford, US9W merged with US9E and continued north as US9 to Mechanicville, where US9 turned west onto modern NY67.|$|E
5|$|Washington Park {{has been}} public {{property}} since the Dongan Charter was granted <b>to</b> <b>Albany</b> incorporating it as a city. The charter specified that all land not privately owned {{at the time}} became property of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty {{of the city of}} Albany, including the land that would become the site of Washington Park. A portion of the land was set aside for a structure built to house gunpowder in 1802, and in 1806 the areas between Willett and Knox streets, and between State Street and Madison Avenue, became the Middle Public Square. In 1800, the land west of Knox Street to Robin Street and south from State Street to Hudson Avenue was taken for a cemetery, which was apportioned into sections for each of Albany's churches. There were separate sections for African-Americans and for strangers. West of the cemetery was the alms-house farm and the penitentiary grounds. In 1809 the Middle Public Square was renamed Washington Square, and later the Washington Parade Ground. In 1868 the remains and headstones in the cemetery were removed and reinterred, most <b>to</b> <b>Albany</b> Rural Cemetery, and some to the cemeteries of other churches.|$|E
