5|$|IndiGo {{became one}} of the fastest growing low cost {{carriers}} in the world and was the largest profitable airline in India. The success of IndiGo has been attributed to its unique business model which reduces costs. The airline operates a single type of aircraft (Airbus A320) in similar seating configuration which simplifies crew training and maintenance. The airline strikes bulk deals with Airbus reducing unit costs. The airline targets a quick <b>turn-around</b> <b>time</b> of 20 minutes to get the aircraft ready for the next flight, ensuring planes fly about 12 hours every day. With this it has created an Indian record of more than 900 flights a day. Employees share multiple roles with a check-in staff doubling as a baggage handler.|$|E

The first part of the study tracked pharmacy orders for a two-month period before the implementation of POE and {{the second part of the}} study tracked pharmacy orders for a two-month period after POE had been implemented. The pre- and post-POE pharmacy <b>turn-around</b> <b>times</b> were compared.

40|$|This work aims to {{estimate}} multiple node {{positions in the}} presence of unknown <b>turn-around</b> <b>times</b> within the context of cooperative sensor network localization. In the adopted scheme, each target can communicate with a set of anchors (probably not in sufficient numbers) and a set of other targets. Two-Way Times-of-Arrival between them are measured, which includes unknown processing delays at both channel endpoints. Since finding the Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) of the positions and <b>turn-around</b> <b>times</b> given those measurements poses a difficult nonconvex optimization problem, it is approximated by a Nonlinear Least Squares problem. Then, the positions and <b>turn-around</b> <b>times</b> of multipletargets are estimated jointly by solving an Euclidean Distance Matrix completion problem. Simulations show that the localization accuracy of the proposed method is good, providing an initial point that subsequently enables MLE to attain the Cram´er-Rao Lower Bound for all considered scenarios...|$|R

5|$|The A-10 was envisioned to {{fly from}} forward air bases and semi-prepared runways with {{high risk of}} foreign object damage to the engines. The unusual {{location}} of the General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines decreases ingestion risk, and allows the engines to run while the aircraft is serviced and rearmed by ground crews, reducing <b>turn-around</b> <b>time.</b> The wings are also mounted closer to the ground, simplifying servicing and rearming operations. The heavy engines require strong supports: four bolts connect the engine pylons to the airframe. The engines' high 6:1 bypass ratio contributes to a relatively small infrared signature, and their position directs exhaust over the tailplanes further shielding it from detection by infrared homing surface-to-air missiles. The engines and exhausts are angled upward by nine degrees to cancel out the nose-down pitching moment that would otherwise generate from being mounted above the aircraft's center of gravity and avoids the need to trim the control surfaces to prevent pitching.|$|E

25|$|Operations {{commenced}} on 7 May 1990. Early {{operations were}} plagued with problems, which often caused the entire operation to collapse throughout the day. The Fokker 50s were prone to various faults, often grounding them. This was exasperated {{by a lack}} of mechanics and spare parts. SAS {{had not been able to}} train sufficient captains in time, which caused additional services to be terminated. Added to this was insufficient <b>turn-around</b> <b>time</b> for the aircraft at the airports, especially in Alta were four aircraft were to operate simultaneously. The increased number of transferring passengers made the system less robust for delays. SAS cut eleven daily services in January 1991, and followed up with a further seventeen —a twenty percent reduction—in October. The airline cited a decline in patronage and an annual loss in Norlink alone of NOK56 million.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The recent {{advent of}} {{multi-core}} computing environments increases {{the heterogeneity of}} grid resources and the complexity of managing them, making efficient load balancing challenging. In an environment where jobs are submitted regularly into a grid which is already executing several jobs, it becomes important to provide low job <b>turn-around</b> <b>times</b> and high throughput for the users. Typically, the grids employ a First Come First Serve (FCFS) method of executing the jobs in the queue which results in suboptimal <b>turn-around</b> <b>times</b> and wait times for most jobs. Hence a conventional FCFS scheduling strategy does not suffice to reduce the average wait times across all jobs. In this paper, we propose new decentralized preemptive scheduling strategies that backfill jobs locally and dynamically migrate waiting jobs across nodes to leverage residual resources, while guaranteeing (on a best effort basis) bounded <b>turn-around</b> and waiting <b>times</b> for all jobs. The methods attempt to maximize total throughput and minimize average waiting time while balancing load across available grid resources. Experimental results for both intra-node and internode scheduling via simulation show that our scheduling schemes perform considerably better than the conventional FCFS approach of a distributed or a centralized scheduler...|$|R

500|$|In {{spite of}} all this and the {{introduction}} of more recent Pacifics, {{in the middle of the}} 1950s Gresley types continued to have a quasi-monopoly of East Coast Main Line express passenger services, and as the Sixties approached they went through yet another series of improvements comparable to those of the 1920s. The most significant of these was the fitting of the French double Kylchap exhaust system, which was entirely due to the persistence from 1956 of P. N. Townend, Assistant District Motive Power Superintendent at King's Cross locomotive shed. [...] These modifications greatly reduced exhaust back pressure, making the locomotives more economical and free-running, and also kept the firetubes clean, reducing <b>turn-around</b> <b>time,</b> so much so that they were able to fit into the more intensive diesel locomotive workings. The Kylchap arrangement was already being universally applied to the A4 streamlined Pacifics, though with the non-streamlined A3 locomotives, the soft exhaust would cause the smoke and steam to drift into the driver's forward vision. The solution came in the form of narrow German-style smoke deflectors, which somewhat changed the appearance of the A3 locomotives in their latter days.|$|E
