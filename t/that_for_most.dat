Among them was the Principality of Polatsk <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of the time was effectively an independent State (apart from about 20 years {{when it was a}} Vassal of Kievan Rus'). The Principality of Polatsk was the first nation state to be established on the land of Belarus.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> people would not be problematic.|$|E
5|$|The {{albatross}} diet {{is predominantly}} cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and offal (organ meat), although {{they will also}} scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton. It should be noted <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> species a comprehensive understanding of diet is known for only the breeding season, when the albatrosses regularly return to land and study is possible. The importance {{of each of these}} food sources varies from species to species, and even from population to population; some concentrate on squid alone, others take more krill or fish. Of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, one, the black-footed albatross, takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid.|$|E

5000|$|In set theory, {{a normal}} measure {{is a measure}} on a {{measurable}} cardinal κ such that the equivalence class of the identity function on κ maps to κ itself in the ultrapower construction. Equivalently, if f:κ→κ is such <b>that</b> f(α)<α <b>for</b> <b>most</b> α<κ, {{then there is a}} β<κ such <b>that</b> f(α)=β <b>for</b> <b>most</b> α<κ. (Here, [...] "most" [...] means that the set of elements of κ where the property holds {{is a member of the}} ultrafilter, i.e. has measure 1.) Also equivalent, the ultrafilter (set of sets of measure 1) is closed under diagonal intersection.|$|R

25|$|In most {{societies}} {{the great}} majority of people eat meat when they can get it, but increasing controversy and debate has arisen over the ethics of eating animals. The most commonly given ethical objection to meat-eating is <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> people living in the developed world, it is not necessary for survival or health; slaughtering animals solely because people enjoy the taste of meat is argued by some to be wrong and morally unjustifiable.|$|E

25|$|Much {{evidence}} suggests <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> {{of the last}} few centuries, nutritional differences accounted for majority of variation of pubertal timing in different populations, and even among social classes in the same population. Recent worldwide increased consumption of animal protein, other changes in nutrition, and increases in childhood obesity have resulted in falling ages of puberty, mainly in those populations with the higher previous ages. In many populations the amount of variation attributable to nutrition is shrinking.|$|E
25|$|Another {{area which}} he {{explored}} was {{the relationship between}} ionic bonding, where electrons are transferred between atoms, and covalent bonding, where electrons are shared between atoms on an equal basis.

Here Pauling's electronegativity concept is particularly useful; the electronegativity difference between a pair of atoms will be the surest predictor of the degree of ionicity of the bond.|$|E

25|$|A major {{point of}} {{contention}} between Panaitescu and Iorga referred to Michael the Brave's historical achievements: sacrilegious {{in the eyes of}} Iorga, Panaitescu placed in doubt Michael's claim to princely descent, and described him as mainly the political agent of boyar interests. Contradicting the Romantic nationalist tradition, Iorga also agreed with younger historians <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of their history, Romanians in Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania were more justifiably attached to their polities than to national awakening ideals. Panaitescu was however more categorical than Iorga in affirming that Michael the Brave's expeditions were motivated by political opportunism rather than by a pan-Romanian national awareness.|$|E
25|$|The hedonic {{treadmill}} theory originally {{proposed that}} most people return to a neutral level of SWB (i.e. neither happy nor unhappy) as they habituate to events. However, subsequent research has shown <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> people, the baseline level of SWB is at least mildly positive, as most people tend to report being at least somewhat happy in general and tend to experience positive mood when no adverse events are occurring. Additional refinements to this theory have shown that people do not adapt to all life events equally, as people tend to adapt rapidly to some events (e.g. imprisonment), slowly to others (e.g. {{the death of a}} loved one), and not at all to others (e.g. noise and sex).|$|E

25|$|The {{legends of}} an Arsacid-era {{collation}} and recension {{are no longer}} taken seriously. It is now certain <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of their long history the Avesta's various texts were handed down orally, and independently of one another, {{and that it was}} not until around the 5th or 6th century that they were committed to written form. However, during their long history, only the Gathic texts seem to have been memorized (more or less) exactly. The other less sacred works appear to have been handed down in a more fluid oral tradition, and were partly composed afresh with each generation of poet-priests, sometimes with the addition of new material. The Younger Avestan texts are therefore composite works, with contributions from several different authors {{over the course of several}} hundred years.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{and historians}} place Caragiale's style midway between the delayed Classicism of 19th century Romanian {{literature}} and Realism (with its fin de siècle development, Naturalism). The writer, who abode by the classical unities, rejected Romantic tenets, and, {{as early as}} the 1870s, opposed the lyricism present in the dramas of Victor Hugo and Friedrich Schiller. Neoclassicism in his works is further enhanced in his drama and comedies by his adherence to Eugène Scribe's principles (see Well-made play). Paul Zarifopol argued <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of his life, Caragiale, the opponent of didacticism, advocated Maiorescu's principles of art for art's sake. He often sketched out alternative endings to his stories, and selected the ones he felt came most natural. Nevertheless, Zarifopol also noted that, late in his life, the writer contemplated adding a didactic message to one of his writings, which was to remain unfinished.|$|E
25|$|Babylonian Judah {{suffered}} a steep decline in both economy and population and lost the Negev, the Shephelah, {{and part of}} the Judean hill country, including Hebron, to encroachments from Edom and other neighbours. Jerusalem, while probably not totally abandoned, was much smaller than previously, and the town of Mizpah in Benjamin in the relatively unscathed northern section of the kingdom became the capital of the new Babylonian province of Yehud Medinata. (This was standard Babylonian practice: when the Philistine city of Ashkalon was conquered in 604, the political, religious and economic elite (but not the bulk of the population) was banished and the administrative centre shifted to a new location). There is also a strong probability <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> or all of the period the temple at Bethel in Benjamin replaced that at Jerusalem, boosting the prestige of Bethel's priests (the Aaronites) against those of Jerusalem (the Zadokites), now in exile in Babylon.|$|E
