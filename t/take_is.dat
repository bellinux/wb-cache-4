5|$|A 29-Cent Robbery is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film features the debut of Marie Eline in the main role as Edna Robinson, a young girl who foils an attempt by a robbery to loot her family's home. All the thief manages to <b>take</b> <b>is</b> her toy bank, containing 29 cents. Edna ends up taking it upon herself to catch the thief after the police fail in the task. It was reviewed positively by critics and was viewed across the United States. The film was the first split-reel by Thanhouser, containing this short and The Old Shoe Came Back on a single reel.|$|E

Its <b>take</b> <b>is</b> that Jacob {{proposed}} a marriage between Shechem and Dinah, sincerely offering Shechem the option of circumcision. Levi opposed the circumcision from the start. Unlike Jubilees and, if Kugel is right, the Testament of Simeon: to the Testament of Levi, intermarriage is lawful in principle between Israelites and converts. Shechem was excluded for its other crimes.|$|E

25|$|Semaphorin-neuropilin repulsive {{signaling}} works synergistically with EphB signaling {{to guide}} neural crest cells down the rostral half of somites in mice. In chick embryos, semaphorin {{acts in the}} cephalic region to guide neural crest cells through the pharyngeal arches. On top of repulsive repulsive signaling, neural crest cells express β1and α4 integrins which allows for binding and guided interaction with collagen, laminin, and fibronectin of the extracellular matrix as they travel. Additionally, crest cells have intrinsic contact inhibition with one another while freely invading tissues of different origin such as mesoderm. Neural crest cells that migrate through the rostral half of somites differentiate into sensory and sympathetic neurons of the peripheral nervous system. The other main route neural crest cells <b>take</b> <b>is</b> dorsolaterally between the epidermis and the dermamyotome. Cells migrating through this path differentiate into pigment cells of the dermis. Further neural crest cell differentiation and specification into their final cell type is biased by their spatiotemporal subjection to morphogenic cues such as BMP, Wnt, FGF, Hox, and Notch.|$|E
25|$|Lomu {{returned}} to professional rugby in 2005. He first needed special clearance from the World Anti-Doping Agency, {{as one of}} the anti-rejection drugs he was required to <b>take</b> <b>is</b> on the WADA list of banned substances. On 8 April 2005, he signed a two-year contract to play for the New Zealand first division provincial team North Harbour in the NPC. He ended up missing the first season when he injured his shoulder scoring a try in a preseason testimonial match against Martin Johnson's invitational XV. Instead he worked in a coaching capacity. North Harbour gave him permission to play overseas at the Cardiff Blues over the off season. Lomu made his first appearance in a competitive match since his transplant on 10 December 2005, with a 60-minute effort in Cardiff's away Heineken Cup fixture against Italian club Calvisano. Lomu scored his first try for Cardiff on 27 December, with a man-of-the-match performance during a 41–23 win against the Newport Gwent Dragons. He spent the early part of 2006 sidelined while he concentrated on gaining speed and strength not playing again until April. He broke his ankle {{near the end of his}} first game back, ending his season with Cardiff.|$|E

500|$|The film {{implies that}} the drug and vitamin regime {{promoted}} by Woodroof was safer and {{more effective than the}} drugs being issued in hospitals and tested by the FDA at the time, but this has been criticized by numerous observers.

500|$|Abbey Road is a rock {{album that}} {{incorporates}} genres such as blues, pop, and progressive rock, {{and it makes}} prominent use of the Moog synthesizer and the Leslie speaker. Side two contains a medley of song fragments edited {{together to form a}} single piece. The album was recorded amid a more enjoyable atmosphere than the Get Back/Let It Be sessions earlier in the year, but there were still frequent disagreements within the band, particularly over Paul McCartney's song [...] "Maxwell's Silver Hammer". John Lennon had privately left the group by the time the album was released and McCartney publicly quit the following year. A 16-minute medley of several short songs comprise the majority of side two, closing with the lyric [...] "and in the end, the love you <b>take</b> <b>is</b> equal to the love you make".|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} New York in October 1986. Madonna {{would ask for}} five minutes to study the script for the scene they were filming. For example, before {{a scene in which}} she needed to appear out of breath, she did a series of push-ups before going on set. Dunne {{observed}} that [...] " [...] likes her first take best. I think my best is around fourth. She always says, 'You got it, you got it,' and she was driving me crazy just like her character would. We had to make a compromise as to which <b>take</b> <b>is</b> the best." [...] Madonna wanted Foley to give her proper direction on set, but he preferred her to be her real self, rather than the persona in her music videos. Regarding her acting abilities, Foley stressed on the fact that Madonna was very uptight and into every detail, determined to have the correct portrayal. [...] "That's probably why it wasn't so good. In Desperately Seeking Susan, when she didn't know what she was doing, she was being natural and at her best." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2003, McCartney persuaded Starr and Ono (as Lennon's widow) {{to release}} Let It Be... Naked, {{touted as the}} band's version of Let It Be remixed by {{independent}} producers. McCartney claimed that his long-standing dissatisfaction with the released version of [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] (and the entire Let It Be album) was in part {{the impetus for the}} new version. The new album included a later take of [...] "The Long and Winding Road", recorded on 31 January. [...] With no strings or other added instrumentation beyond that which was played in the studio at the time, it was closer to the Beatles's original intention than the 1970 version. This <b>take</b> <b>is</b> also the one seen in the film Let It Be and on the Beatles' 2015 video compilation 1. Starr said of the Let It Be... Naked version: [...] "There's nothing wrong with Phil's strings , this is just a different attitude to listening. But it's been 30-odd years since I've heard it without all that and it just blew me away." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} the post-apocalyptic world and the survival horror genre gave {{them the opportunity to}} better develop the characters. Taking inspiration from their work on the Uncharted games, the team used their knowledge of paralleling characters with the conflict in both gameplay and stories when developing The Last of Us. They also took inspiration from the books The Road (2006) and City of Thieves (2008), and the film No Country for Old Men (2007), noting that they all include memorable characters and using this as a point of inspiration. [...] "e can make you as a player feel more of what it's truly like to exist inside of a world where every bullet counts and each step you <b>take</b> <b>is</b> a conscious choice that's going to make or break your existence," [...] said Straley. The team also {{felt that the}} [...] "pressures of the world" [...] allowed them to better develop their characters. They felt that the pressure forced the characters to make interesting decisions, allowing better development.|$|E
500|$|Hyde {{used the}} digital audio {{workstation}} Pro Tools during the engineering, [...] production, and audio mixing {{stages of the}} album. Slayer members {{wanted to keep the}} use of computer effects to a minimum, only to include a small amount of delay and distortion. As with previous recordings, the drum tracks were recorded first. Drummer Paul Bostaph follows a simple rule suggested by Rubin when in the studio: [...] "The perfect <b>take</b> <b>is</b> the one that felt like it was going to fall apart but never did." [...] Seven-string guitars were used on the tracks [...] "Scarstruck" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Pain," [...] the first time Slayer had done so. King was at the B.C. Rich guitar company (manufacturer of his signature model, the KKV) and decided to borrow a seven string guitar. After writing one song, King ordered a seven string as he thought [...] "there's no point having one tuning for just one song," [...] so he wrote another, going on to comment [...] "you don't have to be good to make up a seven-string riff." [...] The album features two songs on seven string guitars, four songs with guitars tuned to Drop-B and all other songs in C# Standard.|$|E
