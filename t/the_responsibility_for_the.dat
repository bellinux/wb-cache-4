5|$|By {{the end of}} 1946, the Montreal Laboratory was {{estimated}} to have cost US$22,232,000, excluding {{the cost of the}} heavy water. The NRX reactor provided Britain, the United States and Canada with a source of fissile plutonium and uranium-233. It also provided a means of efficiently producing medical isotopes like phosphorus-32, research facilities that for a time were superior to those in the United States, and a wealth of technical information related to reactor design and operation. With the passage of the Canadian Atomic Energy Act of 1946, <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Chalk River Laboratories passed to the Atomic Energy Control Board.|$|E

5|$|Finally in 520, Vitalian was {{appointed}} ordinary consul for the year, sharing {{the office with}} Rusticius. Nevertheless, the former rebel continued to pose a potential challenge to Justin, and more importantly to his nephew and heir-apparent, Justinian (r. 527–565). Thus, in July {{of the same year}} he was murdered inside the Great Palace along with his secretary Paulus and his domesticus (aide) Celerianus. According to John of Nikiou, he was killed because he was plotting against Justin; most chroniclers, however, put <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> crime on Justinian's desire to rid himself of a potential rival for his uncle's succession.|$|E

The manner in which maintenance and personnel records were kept by the company confirms this conclusion.|$|E
5|$|In February 1995, SINTEF {{handed over}} a report {{ordered by the}} {{commission}} which revealed several absent safety procedures in Widerøe. The report {{was based on a}} recommendation by the International Civil Aviation Organization to take into consideration the organizational structure the aircraft operate within when investigating aviation accidents. In June, parliamentarian Magnus Stangeland criticized the commission for working too slow, stating that the victims and next of kin needed answers to why the accident happened. The lack of cooperation between the police and the commission was the main source of the delays. Similar delays had occurred after Partnair Flight 394 in 1989, which had resulted in the statute of limitations having come into effect by the time the report was published. A temporary report was presented to the survivors and next of kin on 20 March 1996; the report laid <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> accident on the airline. The final report was published on 10 July 1996 and laid <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> accident on the company and its operating routines. The report contained 26 recommendations for improvements for the company. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority decided in September 1997 not to charge Widerøe for the accident.|$|E

The 2007–2008 Kenyan crisis followed the presidential election that was held on 27 December 2007. The Electoral Commission of Kenya officially declared that the incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was re-elected; supporters of the opposition candidate Raila Odinga accused the government of electoral fraud and rejected the results. A series of protests and demonstrations followed, and fighting—mainly along tribal lines—led to many deaths, injuries and displacements.|$|E
5|$|Although operationally {{placed at}} the {{disposal}} of the British, the AIF was administered as a separate national force, with the Australian government reserving <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> promotion, pay, clothing, equipment and feeding of its personnel. The AIF was administered separately from the home-based army in Australia, and a parallel system was set up to deal with non-operational matters including record-keeping, finance, ordnance, personnel, quartermaster and other issues. The AIF also had separate conditions of service, rules regarding promotion and seniority, and graduation list for officers. This responsibility initially fell to Bridges, in addition to his duties as its commander; however, an Administrative Headquarters was later set up in Cairo in Egypt. Following the redeployment of the Australian infantry divisions to the Western Front it was relocated to London. Additional responsibilities included liaison with the British War Office as well as the Australian Department of Defence in Melbourne, whilst also being tasked with the command of all Australian troops in Britain.

5|$|During the 20th century, the British {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to integrate the}} princely states more closely with British India, in 1921 creating the Chamber of Princes as a consultative and advisory body, and in 1936 transferring <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> supervision of smaller states from the provinces to the centre and creating direct relations between the Government of India and the larger princely states, superseding political agents. A more ambitious aim was a scheme of federation contained in the Government of India Act 1935, which envisaged the princely states and British India being united under a federal government. This scheme came close to success, but was abandoned in 1939 {{as a result of}} the outbreak of the Second World War. As a result, in the 1940s the relationship between the princely states and the crown remained regulated by the principle of paramountcy and by the various treaties between the British crown and the states.|$|E
5|$|Pope's {{reputation}} {{suffered a}} serious blow in 1879 when a late-convened Board of Inquiry called by President Rutherford B. Hayes {{and led by}} Maj. Gen. John Schofield (Pope's immediate predecessor in the Department of the Missouri and then head of the Department of the Pacific) concluded that Major General Fitz John Porter had been unfairly convicted of cowardice and disobedience at the Second Battle of Bull Run. The Schofield report used evidence of former Confederate commanders and concluded that Pope himself bore most of <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Union loss. The report characterized Pope as reckless and dangerously uninformed about events during the battle, also criticized General Irvin McDowell (whom Pope detested), and credited Porter's perceived disobedience with saving the Union army from complete ruin. Soon, Schofield himself was criticized for his actions as superintendent of the U.S. Military at West Point following the hazing of an African American cadet.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Stord Bridge was undertaken {{as part of the}} same contract as the Bømla Bridge, which was awarded in December 1998 to Triangle Contractors, a joint venture between NCC and HBG Steel Structures. Most of the work was carried out by NCC with HBG having responsibility for the steel parts of the deck and the cables. HBG had previously built the steel for the Osterøy Bridge, which opened in 1997. <b>The</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cables was given to Brown Beach Associates and Hordaland Mekaniske Verksted. Construction started on 20 February 1999. After the pylons were completed on 25 September 1999, two catwalks were erected between them, with the constructors choosing two continuous catwalks instead of three separate pairs. Extra stability to the catwalks was achieved by building connections between the two.|$|E

The AIF Headquarters and its subordinate units were almost entirely independent from the British Army, which allowed the force to be self-sustaining in many fields. The AIF generally followed British administrative policy and procedures, including for the awarding of imperial honours and awards.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the QEW dates back to 1931, when work began to widen the Middle Road {{in a similar fashion}} to the nearby Dundas Highway and Lakeshore Road as a relief project during the Great Depression. Following the 1934 provincial election, Ontario Minister of Highways Thomas McQuesten and his deputy {{minister}} Robert Melville Smith changed the design to be similar to the autobahns of Germany, dividing the opposite directions of travel and using grade-separated interchanges at major crossroads. When it was initially opened to traffic in 1937, it was the first intercity divided highway in North America and featured the longest stretch of consistent illumination in the world. While not a true freeway at the time, it was gradually upgraded, widened and modernized beginning in the 1950s, more or less taking on its current form by 1975. Since then, various projects have continued to widen the route. In 1997, the provincial government turned over <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> section of the QEW between Highway427 and the Humber River to the City of Toronto. This section was subsequently redesignated as part of the Gardiner Expressway.|$|E
5|$|When {{rebel forces}} entered the palace, the Ngô {{brothers}} were not present, having escaped before to a loyalist shelter in Cholon. The brothers had kept {{in communication with}} the rebels through a direct link from the shelter to the palace, and misled them into believing {{that they were still}} in the palace. The Ngô brothers soon agreed to surrender and were promised safe exile; after being arrested, they were instead executed in the back of an armoured personnel carrier by ARVN officers on the journey back to military headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base. While no formal inquiry was conducted, <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> deaths of the Ngô brothers is commonly placed on Minh's bodyguard, Captain Nguyễn Văn Nhung, and on Major Dương Hiếu Nghĩa, both of whom guarded the brothers during the trip. Minh's army colleagues and US officials in Saigon agreed that Minh ordered the executions. They postulated various motives, including that the brothers had embarrassed Minh by fleeing the Gia Long Palace, and that the brothers were killed to prevent a later political comeback. The generals initially attempted to cover up the execution by suggesting that the brothers had committed suicide, but this was contradicted when photos of the Ngôs' corpses surfaced in the media.|$|E
