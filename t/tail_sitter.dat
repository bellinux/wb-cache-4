40|$|A new {{automatic}} {{flight control}} system concept suitable for aircraft with highly nonlinear aerodynamic and propulsion characteristics and which must operate over a wide flight envelope was investigated. This exact model follower inverts a complete nonlinear model of the aircraft {{as part of the}} feed-forward path. The inversion is accomplished by a Newton-Raphson trim of the model at each digital computer cycle time of 0. 05 seconds. The combination of the inverse model and the actual aircraft in the feed-forward path alloys the translational and rotational regulators in the feedback path to be easily designed by linear methods. An explanation of the model inversion procedure is presented. An extensive set of simulation data for essentially the full flight envelope for a vertical attitude takeoff and landing aircraft (VATOL) is presented. These data demonstrate the successful, smooth, and precise control that can be achieved with this concept. The trajectory includes conventional flight from 200 to 900 ft/sec with path accelerations and decelerations, altitude changes of over 6000 ft and 2 g and 3 g turns. Vertical attitude maneuvering as a <b>tail</b> <b>sitter</b> along all axes is demonstrated. A transition trajectory from 200 ft/sec in conventional flight to stationary hover in the vertical attitude includes satisfactory operation through lift-cure slope reversal as attitude goes from horizontal to vertical at constant altitude. A vertical attitude takeoff from stationary hover to conventional flight is also demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} {{in the field of}} Mini-UAVs lead to successful designs in both hovering rotorcraft and fixed wing aircraft. However, a polyvalent MAV capable of stable hovering and fast forward flight is still expected. A promising candidate for such versatile missions consists of a tilt-body tail-sitter configuration. That concept is studied in this paper both from the flight mechanics and control points of view. Developments are based on an existing prototype called Vertigo. It consists of a <b>tail</b> <b>sitter</b> fixed-wing mini-UAV equipped with a contra-rotating pair of propellers in tractor configuration. A wind-tunnel campaign was carried out to extract experimental results from the Vertigo aerodynamic characteristics. A 6 -component sting balance was fitted in the powered model enabling excursion in angles of attack and sideslip angles up to 90 °. Thus, a detailed understanding of the transition mechanism could be obtained. An analytical model including propwash effects was derived from experimental results. The analytical model was used to compute stability modes for specific flight conditions. This allowed an appropriate design of the autopilot capable of stabilisation and control over the whole flight envelope. A gain sequencing technique was chosen to ensure stability while minimising control loop execution time. A MATLAB-based flight simulator including an analytical model for the propeller slipstream has been developed in order to test the validity of airborne control loops. Simulation results are presented in the paper including hover flight, forward flight and transitions. Flight tests lead to successful inbound and outbound transitions of the Vertigo...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{progress}} seen in {{the areas}} of Science and Technology have not resolved even some of our basic transportation issues. The challenges only seem to have increased with the passage of time. The ever increasing population coupled with the increasing trends of transportation requirements is pushing the scientists and the R&D engineers across the globe to invent and discover more efficient aircrafts which are not only eco-friendly but also provide a convenient and cost effective means of transportation of man and material. The evolution of Personal Air Vehicles (PAV) is expected to provide a possible solution for this problem. The design of the PAV was evolved from the appearance of a flightless bird named Puffin which is eco-friendly in nature and so, its structure is incorporated in the basic skeleton of the vehicles by few scientists. The striking appearance includes an unusual landing <b>tail</b> <b>sitter</b> which has its landing gear covered while it is in flight mode. The unique features include vertical take-off and landing which is uncommon but can be used effectively under emergency situations. It is firmly believed that the subtle intricacies and robustness of the vehicle would add to the future charisma in the field of Aerospace Technology. The usage of electric powered motors, propeller rotor hubs, and electric actuators for the wing and tail vertical stabilizer flaps are some of the salient features of the vehicle. The project primarily involves three basic aspects namely design, analysis and fabrication of the vehicle. The design includes creation and refinement of the basic part drawing using the “CREO PARAMETRIC 1. 0 ” platform. This platform was been chosen after a detailed study of the various options available and after comparing the merits and demerits of the various packages existing today...|$|E
