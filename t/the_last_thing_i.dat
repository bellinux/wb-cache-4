25|$|Emin {{has often}} {{made use of}} found objects in her work from the early use of a {{cigarette}} box found {{in a car crash}} in which her uncle died. The most well known example is My Bed, where she displayed her bed. Another instance is the removal of her beach hut from Whitstable to be displayed in a gallery. This work was titled <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>I</b> Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here (The Hut) (1999).|$|E

500|$|Boycott and Denness {{did not get}} on well, {{and at the end}} of {{the tour}} they clashed over Boycott's {{preference}} for a one-day match over a three-day game against Bermuda. Boycott recalled in his autobiography that when Denness confronted him on the issue he replied [...] "Get out of here before I do something I'll regret." [...] Boycott had [...] "no confidence in Denness's professional ability and no respect for him as a man and another tour like the previous one to the West Indies was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> wanted." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{backlash}} against grunge {{began to develop}} in Seattle; in late 1992 Jonathan Poneman {{said that in the}} city, [...] "All things grunge are treated with the utmost cynicism and amusement [...] Because the whole thing is a fabricated movement and always has been." [...] Many grunge artists were uncomfortable with their success and the resulting attention it brought. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "Famous is <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> wanted to be." [...] Pearl Jam also felt the burden of success, with much of the attention falling on frontman Eddie Vedder.|$|E
500|$|Swift did {{not want}} any misconceptions of Beautiful Eyes as her second album and {{therefore}} partnered with the American retail company Wal-Mart to make the EP an exclusive release. The album was only made available through American Wal-Mart stores and Wal-Mart's website. Furthermore, it was made a limited release because Swift only allowed Big Machine Records to manufacture {{a certain number of}} copies of the EP. She said, [...] "I’m only letting my record company make a small amount of these. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> want any of you to think is that we are putting out too many releases." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{has been}} {{described}} by Stephen Banfield as the most distinguished British female composer of the inter-war generation. However, her later output was sporadic. She suffered from dysthymia, a chronic form of depression; the lack of encouragement—sometimes outright discouragement—she received for her work also made her reluctant to compose. Clarke did not consider herself able to balance her personal life and the demands of composition: [...] "I can't do it unless it's the first thing I think of every morning when I wake and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> think of every night before I go to sleep." [...] After her marriage, she stopped composing, despite the encouragement of her husband, although she continued working on arrangements until shortly before her death. She also stopped performing.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Go-Set was {{the only}} Australian {{newspaper}} or magazine dealing with teen issues and culture. Rival newspapers attacked Saddington's direct approach, and parents, on talk-back radio, challenged her answers as not being aimed at the correct age group: [...] "her readers {{were too young to}} understand the column". Saddington defended her writing with [...] "Obviously some people can't face reality". In 2002 she recalled [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> wrote was that if they could talk more to their mothers then they wouldn't have to write to me".|$|R

Master's master and missus too, here; and drives us half wild with the fuss he makes about our caps and ribbons. He's such an austerious man, that he will have our caps as he likes 'em. It's bad enough when a missus meddles with a poor servant's ribbons; but to have master come down into the kitchen, and--Well, it's no use telling you of it, Sir--and--and thank you, Sir, for what you've given me, all the same!" ...|$|R

500|$|In {{an online}} chat with website Reddit, Madonna {{addressed}} the concerns regarding the mastering {{issues with the}} DVD and Blu-ray in Europe, saying that she was horrified about the glitches and her record label was solving it. She concluded by saying that [...] " [...] spent 6 months editing and doing the sound mix for the DVD <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> want to hear is that the fans aren't getting the fruits of my labor." [...] On September 23, 2013, Interscope Records announced that they were recalling all the Blu-ray discs issued in US, after hearing continuous reports of glitches in the sound from consumers, adding that an [...] "error in manufacturing" [...] compromised the 5.1 audio of the discs.

500|$|Other {{love songs}} on the album include [...] "Tenderly" [...] by Walter Gross and Jack Lawrence, and [...] "I Only Have Eyes for You" [...] by Al Dubin. James' vocals on Duke Ellington and Paul Francis Webster's [...] "I Got It Bad (and That Ain't Good)" [...] are [...] "barely audible" [...] as she sings [...] "... I... can't... live without him." [...] "I Got It Bad" [...] is {{followed}} by a cover of John Frederick Coots and Haven Gillespie's 1933 popular song [...] "You Go to My Head". Mike Finnigan performs the Hammond organ solo on [...] "A Sunday Kind of Love" [...] and throughout the album, filling the gap between blues and jazz music. Closing the album are Sammy Cahn and Saul Chaplin's [...] "If It's <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>I</b> Do", and Alice Cooper's [...] "Only Women Bleed". James had recorded [...] "Only Women Bleed" [...] previously.|$|E
500|$|Takei {{declared}} {{it was not}} a decrease on the series profitability that was the reason for its cancellation, but a [...] "fatigue" [...] he had been through because he was no more able to follow his fans' wishes. In the author's opinion, Shaman King was being [...] "normalized" [...] by the desire of his readers with the introduction of typical shōnen aspects and losing its originality. In 2007 he revealed he was planning to end the series with the final he initially envisioned to be published in another Shueisha magazine in {{the end of the year}} or in the beginning of 2008. Eventually the entire series was reprinted in 27 kanzenban volumes with the title Shaman King Kanzen-Ban (or [...] "Perfect Edition"), concluding with the [...] "true ending" [...] to the series. The new series finale was also posted on the official Kanzen-Ban website, in addition to the print editions. The first volume of the Perfect Edition was released on March 4, 2008, with the last (volume 27) being published on April 3, 2009. Five years after the end of the series, when the Shaman King Kanzen-Ban was finished, Takei said, [...] "After making the readers [...] so much for this, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do was to disappoint them". He thought the ending was a [...] "huge responsibility". This edition served to make corrections and adjustments and, for Takei, it was something [...] "fun," [...] as it was different from scratch.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dedication}} is [...] "For Richard / dearest and closest {{of friends}} / your favourite book / in memory", and the author's website tells that [...] "I am still {{getting used to}} life without my dear Richard. For {{those of you who}} haven't seen this before, he died in October 2008". [...] The author says in her publisher's newsletter: [...] "The greatest recommendation I can give is that Richard, its first reader, thought it wonderful. He devoured chunks, demanding ‘Bringmore story!’ even when he was in hospital. One of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> was ever able to tell him was that Rebels and Traitors was to be published by Random House, so I would be working with dear friends for his favourite book." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Heaven forbid! The man. He {{wants to}} appear to THEM." [...] That he might was an awful conception, and yet, somehow, I could keep it at bay; which, moreover, as we lingered there, was what I succeeded in {{practically}} proving. I had an absolute certainty that I should see again what I had already seen, but something within me said that by offering myself bravely as the sole subject of such experience, by accepting, by inviting, by surmounting it all, I should serve as an expiatory victim and guard the tranquility of my companions. The children, in especial, I should thus fence about and absolutely save. I recall one of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> said that night to Mrs. Grose.|$|R
5000|$|Ullman {{revealed}} her long-held {{desire to}} return to British television in 2015. [...] "I have lived in America for a really long time, but I was never away from England. I was always there, I just didnt work there. I wasnt offered anything there really. So when the BBC called me last year, I was really thrilled. I mean, I {{wanted to do something}} England. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>Id</b> done was with Michael Palin. We did Tracey Ullman: A Class Act in 1992, I think. We did a show about the class system in Britain and it was just wonderful fun. And from that HBO picked that up and I did Tracey Takes On. So it started from a British show." ...|$|R
500|$|As the {{acoustic}} tour made Grohl realize [...] "we were making music worth listening to, rather than music made for pummelling the person next to you" [...] {{he decided to}} give more importance to the lyrics and [...] "have a connection with the crowd in front of us", considering that among the many compositions the band made on pre-production [...] "the ones that stand out {{are the ones that}} say something". So {{for the first time the}} lyrics started being written before recording begun, with Grohl stating that he [...] "sat in the back of the studio and just wrote every day for about 14 hours a day." [...] Most of the lyrics of the album deal with themes of birth, death and life, which Grohl attributed to the birth of his daughter Violet, considering that having a child [...] "changes your entire outlook on the world", and that he was suddenly more emotional - [...] "So when you're writing music with that in mind or that in your heart, everything just blooms into this fucking incredibly colourful, colourful feeling." [...] Helped by the extensive lyrical preparation, the lyrics also tried to show more of Grohl's feelings, [...] "those things that you've always wanted to do or always wanted to say", with Hawkins adding that he could not listen to [...] "Stranger Things Have Happened" [...] as [...] "I'm one of his best friends, and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> want to do is read a love letter to his wife or whoever it is." ...|$|E
