5|$|Dozzell {{retired from}} {{professional}} football in 2001 {{as a result}} of persistent injuries, in particular an ongoing toe problem. However, he continued playing with non-league clubs; a brief spell with Canvey Island reunited him with former Colchester and Ipswich player Neil Gregory. Canvey Island released him and he moved on <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> shorter stay with Grays Athletic, who signed him alongside Carl Leaburn. This was followed by a move back to Ipswich and into management.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Somerset's {{successor}} John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, made Duke of Northumberland in 1551, {{was once}} regarded by historians {{merely as a}} grasping schemer who cynically elevated and enriched himself {{at the expense of}} the crown. Since the 1970s, the administrative and economic achievements of his regime have been recognised, and he has been credited with restoring the authority of the royal Council and returning the government <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> keel after the disasters of Somerset's protectorate.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, {{there was an}} old ferry road near the mouth of Little Wapwallopen Creek. A {{railroad}} bridge also crosses the creek. Historically, a road ran from a small settlement on Big Wapwallopen Creek <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> smaller one on Little Wapwallopen Creek, near where Church Road presently is. The Glen Brook Water Company once had plans to construct a dam on the creek and also on its tributary Pond Creek. The Wilkes-Barre Ice Company and the Hazleton Ice Company also dammed a stream in the creek's watershed in 1912 and 1916 respectively, forming the Ice Ponds.|$|E
5|$|The 1885 season brought Navy's overall win–loss record <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> 3–3–1. It {{also brought}} the Academy's record against Johns Hopkins to 2–2 tie. The season {{marked the first}} time a team for the Naval Academy would play a multiple-game season. In 1886, their {{schedule}} was expanded from three games to five, and continued to grow through subsequent years. It was the worst single-season record for the Academy until 1888, when they went 1–4. Navy would finish the 1880s with four winning seasons, and an overall record of 14–12–2. The school would outscore their opponents 292–231, and would finish the 19th century with an overall record of 54–19–3.|$|E
5|$|The 1907–08 {{season was}} {{a season of}} change for Ottawa. Harry Smith and Hamby Shore left to join Winnipeg. Ottawa hired several free agents, {{including}} Marty Walsh, Tommy Phillips and Fred 'The Listowel Whirlwind' Taylor. Taylor was hired away from the International Professional Hockey League (IHL) for the 1908 season for a $1000 salary and a guaranteed federal civil service job. He was an immediate sensation and earned a new nickname of 'Cyclone' for his fast skating and end-to-end rushes, the nickname attributed to the Canadian governor-general Earl Grey. Phillips was signed from Kenora <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> higher salary of $1,500 for the season, partially paid for by Ottawa sportsmen.|$|E

5|$|The Ninth Five-Year Plan {{delivered}} a change: {{for the first}} time industrial consumer products out-produced industrial capital goods. Consumer goods such as watches, furniture and radios were produced in abundance. The plan still left the bulk of the state's investment in industrial capital-goods production. This outcome was not seen as a positive sign {{for the future of the}} Soviet state by the majority of top party functionaries within the government; by 1975 consumer goods were expanding 9% slower than industrial capital-goods. The policy continued despite Brezhnev's commitment to make a rapid shift of investment to satisfy Soviet consumers and lead <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> higher standard of living. This did not happen.|$|E
5|$|Kosygin {{initiated}} the 1973 Soviet economic reform {{to enhance the}} powers and functions of the regional planners by establishing associations. The reform was never fully implemented; indeed, members of the Soviet leadership complained that the reform had not even begun {{by the time of}} the 1979 reform. The 1979 Soviet economic reform was initiated to improve the then-stagnating Soviet economy. The reform's goal was to increase the powers of the central ministries by centralising the Soviet economy <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> greater extent. This reform was also never fully implemented, and when Kosygin died in 1980 it was practically abandoned by his successor, Nikolai Tikhonov. Tikhonov told the Soviet people at the 26th Party Congress that the reform was to be implemented, or at least parts of it, during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985). Despite this, the reform never came to fruition. The reform is seen by several Sovietologists as the last major pre-perestroika reform initiative put forward by the Soviet government.|$|E
5|$|The {{implications}} here is that, {{from this}} time onwards, the Hiberno-Scandinavian ruler would hold his kingship from his Munster overlord. Brian, at this stage, aspired <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> tighter dominance of Dublin that than secured by his rival, Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill , ten years earlier. There seems to {{be little doubt that}} the longer term beneficiary of Glenn Máma was Brian alone. With renewed confidence, he again moved against Máel Sechnaill| Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, even if his initiatives of 1000-1001 resulted in setbacks, one expedition into Brega resulted in his advance cavalry being slaughtered by the Uí Néill, another foray was reversed in Míde (Co Westmeath), and the Dál Cais river-fleet was impeded by the King of Tara and his Connachta allies having constructed a barrier across the Shannon. Brian, however, found a way of circumventing hit and, early in 1002, brought a large army through to Athlone and took the hostages of Connacht.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} turned into {{floating}} AA batteries {{over the next}} several months although it availed them little when they were attacked again by American carrier aircraft in July. On the 24th Ise was struck by five bombs and near missed multiple times; all told she lost 50 crewmen killed and many others wounded. The bombs started numerous leaks and Ise began to settle by the bow, although she was returned <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> keel after three days pumping. Hyūga was a primary focus of the attack and she received 10 direct hits and up to 30 near misses. She was badly damaged with some 200-odd crewmen killed and 600 wounded during the attack. She slowly foundered over the next two days and was not attacked when the Americans returned four days later. This time it was Ises turn and she was struck 11 or more times with many near misses that put her on the bottom in shallow water with a 15 degree list. The sisters were struck off the Navy List in November and their wrecks were scrapped after the war.|$|E
5|$|When {{grown in}} {{favorable}} conditions of high water availability and humidity, the fruit body can proliferate by growing additional (secondary) fruit bodies on {{all parts of}} its upper and lower surfaces. These secondary growths typically number between four and seven; some may be aborted as the nutrients from the pine cone substrate are depleted, resulting in stems lacking caps. In one instance, a complete secondary proliferation was noted (i.e., growing from a primary proliferation) that developed completely so as to produce viable spores. Humidity is a limiting factor for optimum fruit body development. Removal of incompletely mature laboratory-grown specimens from a relative humidity (R.H.) of over 98% to one of 65–75% causes the fruit bodies to brown and stop growing. When transferred <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> lower R.H. of about 50%, the stems quickly begin to collapse. Light also affects fruit body development: both continuous illumination and complete darkness inhibit growth.|$|E
5|$|Many of the pre-game and in-game {{strategic}} {{decisions in}} baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters {{tend to be}} more successful against left-handed pitchers and, <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> greater degree, left-handed batters {{tend to be more}} successful against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher may respond by starting {{one or more of the}} right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions: the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder. Furthermore, unlike players in most team sports, baseball players can not return to a game after being replaced; this creates a greater risk when making lineup changes, especially as a team's pitching staff may be increasingly depleted in the late innings of a game, particularly one which goes into multiple extra innings.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins as}} Walt furiously notices a motion-detecting {{surveillance}} camera {{that has been}} installed in the lab. Later that day, Skyler convinces Walt {{in a meeting with}} Saul to buy the car wash by mentioning how the owner insulted his manhood. She devises a plan to trick the owner into selling by having a con artist (supplied by Saul) pretend to be a water-tester who is shutting down the business out of concerns over contaminants. The owner promptly sells to her, agreeing <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> lower price than her original offer. Jesse is still feeling numb from recent events, attempting to clear his head with nostalgic go-kart trips. He continues to open his house up for all-night drug-fueled orgies, deliberately throwing piles of money {{in the midst of the}} chaos. Angry and frustrated by Hank's continuous cold shoulder, Marie resumes her kleptomania; she starts stealing objects from real-estate open houses, where she also makes up elaborate stories about who she is, but is eventually caught by a real-estate agent. A livid Hank pulls strings with a senior police officer to get her out of being charged. The same officer drops by the Schrader residence to seek Hank's help by giving him Gale's lab notes to look at. Hank initially shoves away the notebook, but begins to read it later that night.|$|E
