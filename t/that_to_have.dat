5|$|Kikai {{had started}} his Asakusa series of square, {{monochrome}} portraits {{as early as}} 1973, but after this there was a hiatus until 1985, {{when he realized that}} an ideal backdrop would be the plain red walls of Sensō-ji. At that time, the great majority of his Asakusa portraits adopted further constraints: the single subject stands {{directly in front of the}} camera (originally a Minolta Autocord TLR, later the Hasselblad), looking directly at it, and is shown from around the knees upwards. Kikai may wait at the temple for four or five hours, hoping to see somebody he wants to photograph, and three or four days may pass without a single photograph; but he may photograph three people in a single day, and he has photographed over six hundred people in this way. He believes <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a plain backdrop and a direct confrontation with the subject allows the viewer to see the subject as a whole, and as somebody on whom time is marked, without any distracting or limiting specificity.|$|E
5|$|Several {{suggestions}} {{have been}} made {{for the history of}} the Great Stone. There was a succession of plagues in Manchester from the 14th century onwards, and during the Great Plague of 1655–56 the holes {{in the top of the}} stone were filled with vinegar or holy water, through which coins were passed in the belief that would halt the spread of the disease. But the holes are probably too deep for <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been the stone's original purpose. It may have been a marker on the Roman road between Northwich and Manchester, or some kind of boundary marker. The Great Stone is also thought to have been the base of an Anglo-Saxon cross shaft. A local legend had it that the stone was slowly sinking into the earth, and that its ultimate disappearance would mark the end of the world.|$|E
5|$|The 1928 {{accident}} inquiry did not attach {{blame to}} the Southern Railway for track maintenance or locomotive performance issues, {{and noted that}} the prototype had run for eight years over the same stretch of line without complaint. However, it identified the Brighton batch and No.A890 as being more susceptible to rolling on sharp curves with weak rail joints, although the entire class operated without incident on the former LBSCR network. The management of the Southern Railway realised <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> any success in operating the Kclass tanks on {{other parts of the}} network, vast stretches of track would require upgrading. With the prospect of storing 20 locomotives whilst the necessary upgrading took place, the management recommended the class be fully withdrawn from service. To recoup the expense of constructing the engines, Maunsell was given permission to rebuild them to the new SR Uclass 2-6-0 tender engine design in 1928. This decision also reduced the adverse publicity generated by the accident. However, many of the components discarded during the rebuilding process would later be re-used on another 2-6-4 tank locomotive designed to haul heavy freight on short trips: the 3-cylinder Wclass of 1932.|$|E

25|$|French {{had hoped}} to {{incorporate}} the Belgian Army into the BEF, but the King of the Belgians vetoed this (2 January). French instead demanded that the New Armies be sent out as battalions and incorporated into existing units (perhaps with battalions combining to form regiments like in continental armies). All the senior commanders agreed <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the New Armies fighting under their own inexperienced division and corps staff would be folly.|$|E
25|$|The proper policy, in my view, {{should be}} to affirm the status of physician-assisted suicide and {{euthanasia}} as illegal. In so doing we would affirm that as a society we condemn ending a patient's life and do not consider <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> one's life ended by a doctor is a right. This does not mean we deny that in exceptional cases interventions are appropriate, as acts of desperation when all other elements of treatment—all medications, surgical procedures, psychotherapy, spiritual care, and so on—have been tried. Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{reviving}} the rallying program, one of Hayes first accomplishments was to sign relatively unknown Scottish racing driver Jackie Stewart. Stewart was attending the 1964 British International Motor Show at Earl's Court, London, when Hayes approached him and later offered Stewart £500 to promote Ford products in 1965, {{along with the}} white Ford Zodiac that was the centrepiece of Ford's exhibit to drive that year. Stewart later commented: “I didn’t know who Walter Hayes was, but I did know <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a contract with Ford Motor Company {{was a big deal}} with great opportunities for the future, even though I wasn’t yet aware that Ford would enter Formula One.” The relationship was to last forty years, and be so successful it was the model for other Formula One stars and motor manufacturers.|$|E

The campaign was designed to raise sufficient funds, $85,000, to avoid pushing back the title from the planned mid-2015 release, and would be aided, if its goal is met, by personal loans and funding from the Indie Fund. The Kickstarter was successful, raising more than $100,000 from nearly 3,700 backers, and through it, several funders shared with the Greens their own photos and stories of their losses of their children at young ages due to incurable or inoperable maladies, which will be included within the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} runners were {{separated}} by less than two seconds with six laps left in the race. Palmer and Leal received frequent reminders to preserve their tyres, while Trummer was informed over the radio <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> any hopes of winning the race he had to attack. Quaife-Hobbs slowed because his tyres had degraded enough to enable Nasr to close up to him. Their battle allowed Pic, Richelmi, Evans and Binder to close up causing jostling and minor contact between all six cars. Nasr initially passed Quaife-Hobbs at the final corner on the 30th lap but Quaife-Hobbs reclaimed fourth place driving into the first turn. Nasr finally got ahead of Quaife-Hobbs by slipstreaming him driving on the outside line heading into turn four. On the final lap, Richelmi overtook Pic at turn eight for fifth place while Pic and Markelov lost positions to Evans and Binder. Trummer was unable to overhaul Palmer who kept the lead {{for the remainder of}} the race to clinch the victory. Trummer finished eight-tenths of a second adrift in second and took his first podium finish since the 2009 International Formula Master. Leal was a further six-tenths of a second in arrears in third, with Nasr fourth and RIchelmi fifth. Quaife-Hobbs, Evans and Binder rounded out the top-eight points scoring positions. Pic, Markelov, de Jong, Izawa, Abt, Cecotto and Lancaster followed in the next seven places with Haryanto, Berthon, Negrão, Sato and Regalia completing the top twenty. Jefferies, Vandoorne, Coletti, Marciello and Rossi were the last of the classified finishers. The victory was Palmer's fourth in the GP2 Series.|$|E

500|$|The {{style of}} Love in Several Masques, along with The Temple Beau (1730), {{exemplified}} Fielding's understanding of traditional Post-Restoration comedic form. Albert Rivero, a critic specialising in early 18th-century literature, believes that Fielding, in the play, [...] "recognizes <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his plays acted at Drury Lane, {{he must have}} the approval of his famous contemporary [...] To gain that approval, Fielding must follow Cibber—if not write like him, certainly write plays that he will like." [...] However, Fielding did not respect Cibber's abilities, nor did he believe that the control Cibber took over the plays performed at the Theatre Royal were improved by Cibber's required changes. Instead, Fielding believed that Cibber {{got in the way}} of comedy. Regardless, there are similarities between the characters in Love in Several Masques and Cibber and Vanbrugh's The Provok'd Husband. In particular, Fielding's Lady Matchless resembles the character Lady Townly.|$|E

500|$|In March 2002, Schwarzenegger {{became the}} {{producer}} of I Am Legend, commencing negotiations with Michael Bay to direct and Will Smith to star in the film. Bay and Smith were attracted to the project based on a redraft that would reduce its budget. However, the project was shelved due to Warner Bros. president Alan F. Horn's dislike of the script. In 2004, Akiva Goldsman was asked by head of production Jeff Robinov to produce the film. In September 2005, director Francis Lawrence signed on to helm the project, with production slated to begin in 2006. Guillermo del Toro was originally approached to direct by Smith, but turned it down to direct [...] Lawrence, whose film Constantine was produced by Goldsman, was fascinated by empty urban environments.

500|$|In R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment, {{ex parte}} Rose Theatre Trust Co. (1989), the High Court of England and Wales adopted a narrow and more {{restrictive}} approach to public standing. Justice Konrad Schiemann held <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> standing, an applicant must expressly or impliedly have [...] "a greater right or expectation {{than any other}} citizen of this country to have that decision taken lawfully". On the facts, an individual interested in seeing {{the remains of a}} historically significant theatre in London called The Rose preserved and made accessible to the public lacked sufficient interest to challenge the Secretary of State for the Environment's decision not to list the theatre as a protected monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.

Despite the fact that this decision could potentially leave an unlawful act by a minister unrebuked, the judge considered that: ...|$|E
500|$|On 29 June 1976, Lefebvre {{went ahead}} with planned priestly ordinations without the {{approval}} of the local Bishop and despite receiving letters from Rome forbidding them. As a result Lefebvre was suspended a collatione ordinum, i.e., forbidden to ordain any priests. A week later, the Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops informed him <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his situation regularized, he needed to ask the Pope's pardon. Lefebvre responded with a letter claiming that the modernisation of the Church was a [...] "compromise with the ideas of modern man" [...] originating in a secret agreement between high dignitaries in the Church and senior Freemasons prior to the Council. Lefebvre was then notified that, since he had not apologised to the Pope, he was suspended a divinis, i.e., he could no longer legally administer any of the sacraments. Lefebvre remarked that he had been forbidden from celebrating the new rite of Mass. Pope Paul VI apparently took this seriously and stated that Lefebvre [...] "thought he dodged the penalty by administering the sacraments using the previous formulas." [...] In spite of his suspension, Lefebvre continued to pray Mass and to administer the other Sacraments, including the conferral of Holy Orders to the students of his seminary.|$|E

500|$|In 2009 Myles stated <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Jack and Gwen act {{on their}} {{feelings}} would be [...] "like feeding the baby when it's not hungry". Reinforcing this view, Julie Gardner feels the love between Gwen and Jack to be self-evident and {{that it did not}} need to be spoken. Lynette Porter argues that Gwen's apotheosis of Jack causes him to flee Earth, as hero is a role he cannot play because he feels responsible for the deaths of those he loved. A press release ahead of the 2011 series stated that though Gwen retreats to a rural idyll with her family, she still retains feelings for Jack and misses the exciting life she once led alongside him. Ahead of the fourth series Myles explains that Gwen and Jack's relationship is a [...] "love-hate-love relationship", which she believes to be reminiscent of, concurrently, a sibling relationship, a husband and wife relationship and [...] "the best friendship known to mankind". Myles feels that Gwen is not complete without Jack and that they are like [...] "two missing parts of a jigsaw" [...] and because the relationship works on so many different levels it cannot be labelled. Episode seven of [...] features a scene where Gwen states that she would have Jack killed to save her daughter. Writer Jane Espenson explains that the two characters' differing needs means that they inevitably [...] "clash like steel blades".|$|E
500|$|In {{their book}} Who is the Doctor, Graeme Burk and Robert Smith {{described}} Adam in [...] "Dalek" [...] as [...] "somewhat annoying". Burk {{referred to him}} in [...] "The Long Game" [...] as [...] "arrogant and narcissistic", which made Rose appear shallow for insisting he travel with them, but felt that Langley did [...] "a superb job" [...] conveying the character's flaws. He stated that it was [...] "a shame" [...] that the backstory of Adam's motivations were cut from the script, {{as it would have}} made his character more believable. The two found a logical flaw in the Doctor's decision to drop Adam off, as it was a possibility that someone could get their hands on the future technology. Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern gave a positive overview of Adam, describing the character as [...] "bumptious yet likeable" [...] and his departure as [...] "literary precision". He commented that Adam [...] "adds an interesting dynamic, subtly different" [...] from Mickey Smith and Captain Jack Harkness, who also worked with Rose and the Ninth Doctor. Instead of threatening the Doctor and Rose's relationship, Adam [...] "serves to strengthen it". In 2010 Mark Harrison of Den of Geek listed the character's exit from the TARDIS as the tenth greatest companion farewell scene stating that it was [...] "great {{to get a glimpse of}} the Doctor outright booting someone out." [...] He felt that the character [...] "struck out in spectacular fashion" [...] by attempting to steal future technology and that his eventual fate was an example of poetic justice. Charlie Jane Anders also praised the concept of Adam's story arc positioning his departure as the seventh most depressing exit from a companion in Doctor Whos history. She felt <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> [...] "a companion who flunks out" [...] was one of Davies' [...] "cleverest ideas" [...] as executive producer of the series and that Adam's human flaws made him relatable. In 2010 readers of the Radio Times voted Adam the 45th most popular companion, out of forty-eight viable options.|$|E
