5|$|Related by {{periodic}} trends, rhenium has {{a similar}} chemistry to that of technetium; work done to label rhenium onto target compounds can often be translated to technetium. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> for radiopharmacy, where {{it is difficult to}} work with technetium – especially the 99m isotope used in medicine – due to its expense and short half-life.|$|E
5|$|The Laue back {{reflection}} mode records X-rays scattered backwards {{from a broad}} spectrum source. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> if the sample is too thick for X-rays to transmit through it. The diffracting planes in the crystal are determined by knowing that the normal to the diffracting plane bisects the angle between the incident beam and the diffracted beam. A Greninger chart {{can be used to}} interpret the {{back reflection}} Laue photograph.|$|E
5|$|Geneticists {{often use}} viruses as vectors to {{introduce}} genes into cells {{that they are}} studying. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use {{in the treatment of}} cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in this approach is increasing, because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria.|$|E
5000|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> an {{information}} <b>useful</b> for all audiences. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> {{an information}} <b>useful</b> for novice audience. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> an information <b>useful</b> for expert audience.|$|R
25|$|<b>This</b> {{definition}} <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> {{because it}} applies to all waveforms, whether they are sinusoidal or not. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> particularly <b>useful</b> in power electronics, where nonsinusoidal waveforms are common.|$|R
5000|$|... —turns {{on display}} of each line number {{as it is}} run ("TRace ON"). <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> for {{debugging}} or correcting of problems in a program.|$|R
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> if the {{equation}} of state is known.|$|E
25|$|A related {{application}} is the acousto-optic modulator, {{a device that}} scatters light off soundwaves in a crystal, generated by piezoelectric elements. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> for fine-tuning a laser's frequency.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> for {{differentiating}} {{a function}} on a grid, where, as one approaches {{the edge of}} the grid, one must sample fewer and fewer points on one side.|$|E
50|$|The {{spring balance}} valve also {{acted as a}} {{pressure}} gauge. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> as previous pressure gauges were unwieldy mercury manometers and the Bourdon gauge {{had yet to be}} invented.|$|R
30|$|The {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (TEM) was carried out using A Zeiss Libra 120 transmission electron microscope at 80  kV voltage. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> to determine {{the size and shape}} of the nanostructure.|$|R
3000|$|..., the maximal {{functions}} play {{a crucial}} tool by Hedberg’s trick (see [23]). In view of [7, 8, 24, 25], the modified maximal operator <b>is</b> bounded and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> for the case when [...]...|$|R
25|$|While moneyness is a {{function}} of both spot and strike, usually one of these is fixed, and the other varies. Given a specific option, the strike is fixed, and different spots yield the moneyness of that option at different market prices; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> in option pricing and understanding the Black–Scholes formula. Conversely, given market data at a given point in time, the spot is fixed at the current market price, while different options have different strikes, and hence different moneyness; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> in constructing an implied volatility surface, or more simply plotting a volatility smile.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful,</b> {{because it}} is usually very {{difficult}} to look at streamlines in an experiment. However, if the flow is steady, one can use streaklines to describe the streamline pattern.|$|E
25|$|Because rebreathers produce {{very few}} bubbles, {{they do not}} disturb marine life or make a diver's {{presence}} known at the surface; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> for underwater photography, and for covert work.|$|E
50|$|Starting in 1942, {{additional}} charts {{were installed}} at the Group plotting centers that allowed information from neighbouring Groups to <b>be</b> recorded. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> for handing over tracks that were moving across Group boundaries.|$|R
25|$|<b>This</b> fact <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> {{when making}} Q–Q plots.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> fact <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> {{when making}} Q-Q plots.|$|R
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful,</b> for instance, in {{computer}} graphics, since shears {{can be implemented}} with fewer multiplication instructions than rotating a bitmap directly. On modern computers, this may not matter, {{but it can be}} relevant for very old or low-end microprocessors.|$|E
25|$|Consider {{a circuit}} where R, L and C {{are all in}} {{parallel}}. The lower the parallel resistance, the more effect it will have in damping the circuit and thus the lower the Q. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> in filter design to determine the bandwidth.|$|E
25|$|As the {{conjugate}} base of acetic acid, {{a solution of}} sodium acetate and acetic acid {{can act as a}} buffer to keep a relatively constant pH level. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> especially in biochemical applications where reactions are pH-dependent in a mildly acidic range (pH 4-6).|$|E
50|$|Shelters {{were built}} beside the Springs. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> for the Fontanin {{to go for}} shelter when there were raids during World War II. This shelter started at the Springs and ended on a cliff {{overlooking}} Fontana.|$|R
25|$|<b>This</b> formula <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> {{especially}} {{when working with}} Fourier transforms.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> {{technique}} <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> {{for analyzing}} psychophysical data (see psychophysics).|$|R
25|$|Starting with Mono 2.6, it is {{possible}} to configure Mono to use the LLVM as the code generation engine instead of Mono's own code generation engine. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> for high performance computing loads and other situations where the execution performance {{is more important than the}} startup performance.|$|E
25|$|Some divers use {{a primary}} {{regulator}} on a 7-foot hose and a secondary on a necklace, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> when {{it may be}} necessary for the divers to swim in single file. the reason for the primary being on a long hose is to ensure the donated regulator is known to be working.|$|E
25|$|A Bézier {{curve of}} degree n can be {{converted}} into a Bézier curve of degree n+1 with the same shape. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> if software supports Bézier curves only of specific degree. For example, systems that can only work with cubic Bézier curves can implicitly work with quadratic curves by using their equivalent cubic representation.|$|E
50|$|The {{width of}} 9.5 mm {{was chosen because}} three strips of film could be made from one strip of unperforated 35 mm film. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> when {{duplicating}} films, because only one strip of 35 mm had to be processed.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> stage <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> for {{identifying}} patients with bacterial overgrowth syndrome.|$|R
30|$|Besides {{the source}} code, we had dynamic data, i.e., logs that saved {{a trace of}} the SQL {{operations}} executed. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> to complete the model with relationships between the database tables and the microservices. A specific parser was built for that task.|$|R
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{notation}} {{for recording}} positions in text format, called the Forsyth–Edwards notation (FEN). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> for adjourning a game to resume later or for conveying chess problem positions without a diagram. A position can also be recorded by listing the pieces and the squares they reside on, for example: White: Ke1, Rd3, etc.|$|E
25|$|Sonomicrometry {{employs a}} pair of {{piezoelectric}} crystals implanted in a muscle or tendon to continuously measure {{the length of a}} muscle or tendon. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> because surface kinematics may be inaccurate due to skin movement. Similarly, if an elastic tendon is in series with the muscle, the muscle length may not be accurately reflected by the joint angle.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, {{other major}} currencies, {{such as the}} pound {{sterling}} and euro, feature notes of differing sizes: {{the size of the}} note increases with the denomination and different denominations are printed in different, contrasting colors. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> not only for the vision-impaired; they nearly eliminate the risk that, for example, someone might fail to notice a high-value note among low-value ones.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> can <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in {{increasing}} program efficiency and reducing code length.|$|R
