5|$|Four {{months after}} her proxy {{marriage}} to Louis, Sigismund entered Hungary and married Mary, but the reconciliation between the fractions {{turned out to be}} too late <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> Charles' invasion. Sigismund fled to his brother's court in Prague in the autumn of 1385.|$|E
5|$|On August 17, Suzuki was {{replaced}} {{as prime minister}} by the Emperor's uncle, Prince Higashikuni, perhaps <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> any further coup or assassination attempts; Mamoru Shigemitsu replaced Tōgō as foreign minister.|$|E
5|$|Back in La Pointe, Buffalo {{took several}} actions <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> and prevent removal. He {{and other leaders}} petitioned the US {{government}} {{for the next two}} years to no avail. They did win considerable sympathy from whites who learned of the debacle in Sandy Lake. Newspapers throughout the Lake Superior region ran editorials condemning the removal effort. Buffalo sent two of his sons to St. Paul, the state capital, where they obtained a portion of the annuities still owed.|$|E
50|$|With a view <b>to</b> <b>forestalling</b> Russian intentions, on 16 April 1885 Pegasus, Agamemnon and Firebrand {{occupied}} Port Hamilton, a {{small group}} of islands in the Jeju Strait off the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula. The base was demolished and the occupation ended on 27 February 1887 after the Russian threat had diminished.|$|R
40|$|Congress is {{considering}} several legislative strategies {{that would reduce}} U. S. emissions of greenhouse gases—primarily carbon dioxide (CO 2) —and/or increase uptake and storage of CO 2 from the atmosphere. Both approaches are viewed by many observers as critical <b>to</b> <b>forestalling</b> global climate change caused, in part, by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activities...|$|R
50|$|As a rural community, Simcoe is {{generally}} 10% drier than {{the major cities}} of Toronto, Hamilton, and Ottawa. It is also 25 times less likely to face smog-related problems between the months of June and September than metropolitan cities like London, Windsor, and Sarnia. Sunny days tend to last 15% longer; granting more needed sunlight for summer days in addition <b>to</b> <b>forestalling</b> the cold and dark winter nights.|$|R
5|$|Bramlette {{resigned}} his judgeship {{and accepted}} a commission as a {{colonel in the}} Union Army on August 7, 1861. In violation of Kentucky's agreement to remain neutral in the Civil War, he raised and commanded the 3rd Kentucky Infantry. On September 19, the 3rd Kentucky marched on Lexington <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> a peace conference scheduled there on September 21 and to arrest the state's junior Senator, John C. Breckinridge. A delay allowed Breckinridge to escape before the arrest was made, and he enlisted in the Confederate Army shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|By April 1917 Heseltine had again {{tired of}} London life. He {{returned}} to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences, {{and made a}} partial peace with the writer. By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated, Heseltine's military exemption came under review; <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, {{with whom he had}} decided he was, after all, in love.|$|E
5|$|Following the secession of Virginia {{and that}} state joining the Confederacy, Federal troops marched from Washington into the Arlington region of {{northern}} Virginia. The move was intended <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> any attempt by Virginia militia or Confederate States Army {{to seize the}} capital city of the United States. Over the next seven weeks, forts were constructed {{along the banks of the}} Potomac River and at the approaches to each of the three major bridges (Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and Aqueduct Bridge) connecting Virginia to Washington and Georgetown.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{believed}} that his campaigns were only a token measure and that Roman rule over the Balkans collapsed immediately after his overthrow in 602, Maurice was in fact well on his way <b>to</b> <b>forestalling</b> the Slavic landfall on the Balkans, nearly preserving the order of Late Antiquity there. His success was only undone over ten years after his overthrow. Retrospectively, these campaigns were the last in the series of classical Roman campaigns against the Barbarians on the Rhine and Danube, effectively delaying Slavic landfall on the Balkans by two decades. With respect to the Slavs, these campaigns had the typical trait of Roman campaigns against unorganized tribes and of what we now call asymmetric warfare.|$|R

5|$|Longren {{obtained}} {{space in}} Topeka {{for a small}} factory and {{enlisted the help of}} his brother Ereanius and his friend William Janicke, a fellow mechanic. Together the three men began working on Longren's design for a new airplane, despite having no prior aviation experience or professional assistance. The trio built the prototype in complete secrecy, wishing <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> publicity of any potential failures; they even disassembled the craft and transported it discreetly in boxes to its first flight trial.|$|E
5|$|Tallard's march {{presented}} a dilemma for Eugene. If the Allies {{were not to}} be outnumbered on the Danube, Eugene realised he must either try to cut Tallard off before he could get there or he must hasten to reinforce Marlborough. if he withdrew from the Rhine to the Danube, Villeroi might also make a move south to link up with the Elector and Marsin. Eugene compromised: leaving 12,000 troops behind guarding the Lines of Stollhofen, he marched off {{with the rest of his}} army <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> Tallard.|$|E
50|$|Starting with Sultan Baibars in 1254, the Islamic chieftains {{declared}} jihad on the Crusaders {{and slowly}} started exterminating the remaining Christian communities on the coastlands. The last archbishops, John and Bonacourt, devoted their rule <b>to</b> <b>forestalling</b> the Mamluk conquest, attempting {{to obtain the}} freedom of enslaved Christians, caring for refugees, and preparing for the coming assault. After a long siege, the city was captured by the Mamluks in 1291. The city was mostly evacuated {{by the time the}} Mamluks arrived, but the remaining population, including the archbishop, were killed or enslaved. The churches were torn down, and the archdiocese became titular; only in the 18th and 19th centuries was a new archbishop appointed to protect the newly restored pilgrim routes.|$|R

50|$|In {{what was}} {{widely seen as}} a {{preemptive}} move <b>to</b> help <b>forestall</b> the incipient World Hockey Association, the NHL announced that Atlanta and Long Island had been granted expansion franchises to begin play in the 1972-73 season.

5|$|The U.S. Army created Fort McDowell on the Verde River in 1865 <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> Native American uprisings. The fort {{established}} a {{camp on the}} south side of the Salt River by 1866, which was the first non-native settlement in the valley after the decline of the Hohokam. In later years, other nearby settlements would form and merge to become the city of Tempe, but this community was incorporated after Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|A {{period of}} {{rebellion}} {{at the start}} of the 19th century led to the rise of the progressive Sultan Mahmud II and eventually to the Tanzimat period, which produced political reforms and allowed new technology to be introduced to the city. Bridges across the Golden Horn were constructed during this period, and Istanbul was connected to the rest of the European railway network in the 1880s. Modern facilities, such as a water supply network, electricity, telephones, and trams, were gradually introduced to Istanbul over the following decades, although later than to other European cities. The modernization efforts were not enough <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> the decline of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|After Christmas 1914, {{sporadic}} {{attempts were}} made at seasonal truces; a German unit attempted to leave their trenches under a flag of truce on Easter Sunday 1915, but were warned off by the British opposite them, {{and later in the}} year, in November, a Saxon unit briefly fraternised with a Liverpool battalion. In December 1915, there were explicit orders by the Allied commanders <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> any repeat of the previous Christmas truce. Individual units were encouraged to mount raids and harass the enemy line, whilst communicating with the enemy was discouraged by artillery barrages along the front line throughout the day. The prohibition was not completely effective, however, and a small number of brief truces occurred.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the emperor Nikephoros Botaneiates tried <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> the capital's {{fall to the}} Komnenoi by sending for Melissenos and asking him to enter the city and assume {{imperial}} authority. His envoys, however, were obstructed by George Palaiologos and never reached Melissenos. Constantinople fell to the Komnenian forces, and on 8 April 1081, Melissenos too entered the imperial capital. True to his word, Alexios I raised him to Caesar and gave him authority over Thessalonica, as well as allotting the city's revenues to his income. At the same time, however, Alexios raised his brother Isaac Komnenos to the newly created dignity of sebastokrator, which he placed above that of Caesar, bypassing Melissenos.|$|E
5|$|Cannon {{recovered}} from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, electrolytic reduction treatment is required <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> the process of corrosion. The cannon is then washed in deionized water to remove the electrolyte, and is treated in tannic acid, which prevents further rust and gives the metal a bluish-black colour. After this process, cannons on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a wax sealant. A coat of polyurethane may also be painted over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane was {{transferred}} to the North America and West Indies station in November 1917, but rejoined the 2nd Cruiser Squadron early in 1918. She was based in Murmansk between March and September 1918 during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. She ferried Soviet troops to Pechenga on 3 May <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> an attempt by White Finns to seize the town. On 14 November 1918 she was stranded in the Mersey Estuary, while {{under the control of the}} pilot, and later broke in two, becoming a total loss. The wreck had been broken up in situ by June 1919.|$|E
40|$|Evolvability {{is key to}} the {{adaptive}} potential of an evolving system. Evolvability itself may be subject to evolution, and this process can greatly enhance or substantially inhibit a system's adaptive potential. In artificial systems, this process can often occur irrespective of the designer's awareness or intention. Sustaining evolvability is of particular importance for extended and possibly open-ended evolution. We recap some of the research done on evolvability and its potential to evolve, and identify a common hazard of this process, the premature stagnation of search via the evolutionary suppression of variability. We describe some approaches <b>to</b> <b>forestalling</b> this problem in the context of static fitness regimes. We then propose that dynamic fitness regimes are a possible key to sustaining variability, and offer some candidates for the form of such regimes.

5|$|In {{a sign of}} {{problems}} to come, three Spaniards passing through a region near the Peñol de Cerquín were attacked and killed. This area was considered pacified, and the attack deeply disturbed Montejo, since similar incidents during his conquest of Yucatán had been a prelude to general uprisings. He rushed {{to the scene of}} the attack with a strong force, and summoned all the native leaders to meet him, in an effort <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> rebellion. He investigated the attack and meted out punishment to the most guilty, then continued with conciliatory policies towards the rest of the leaders, who reaffirmed their loyalty. Montejo let the leaders return to their people, then marched to Comayagua to reinforce Cáceres, before returning to Gracias a Dios.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, the French Red Cross {{supplied}} 1.5tons of supplies to approximately 10,000people victims of Kalunde. Mauritius Deputy Prime Minister Paul Berenger visited the island Friday to assess the damage while another official called on Mauritius officials to contribute to a cyclone relief fund for the island group. Twenty technicians were also sent to the area in wake of the storm. Officials estimated that it would take five weeks for power to be fully restored across Rodrigues. They also stated that if a similar situation took place and people were in need of emergency services, no one would be able to receive them. Furthermore, they proposed that bridges would to be built in order <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> roads from being washed out again.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{announced}} his second abdication on 24 June 1815. In the final skirmish of the Napoleonic Wars, Marshal Davout, Napoleon's minister of war, {{was defeated by}} Blücher at Issy on 3 July 1815. Allegedly, Napoleon tried to escape to North America, but the Royal Navy was blockading French ports <b>to</b> <b>forestall</b> such a move. He finally surrendered to Captain Frederick Maitland of HMS Bellerophon on 15 July. There was a campaign against French fortresses that still held out; Longwy capitulated on 13 September 1815, the last to do so. Louis XVIII was restored to the throne of France and Napoleon was exiled to Saint Helena, where he died in 1821. The Treaty of Paris was signed on 20 November 1815.|$|E
