Love of the truth brought me to Tibur, but Onuava’s favorable powers came with me. Thus, divine mother, far from my home-land, exiled in Italy, I address my vows and prayers to you no less.|$|E

500|$|The Monadnock {{was widely}} praised by early twentieth-century German architects, {{including}} Mies, who on {{his arrival in}} Chicago in 1938 declared that [...] "The Monadnock block is of such vigor and force that I am at once proud and happy <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> home here." [...] These European architects found the building's attention to purpose and functional expression inspiring. Bauhaus architect Ludwig Hilberseimer wrote that [...] "The false solution—unfortunately too common—of applying meaningless and misplaced adornment is here instinctively avoided. An innate feeling for proportion gives this great building inner consistency and logical purity." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Larysa Kondracki and co-screenwriter Eilis Kirwan {{learned of}} Bolkovac's story while {{attending}} Columbia University, {{eight years before}} the film's production. Kondracki subsequently devoted significant time to research human trafficking and the sex trade. After Bolkovac sold her the film rights for $100, she resolved to adapt the story for the screen. Financing for the project was initially difficult to secure, although the situation improved after Rachel Weisz was cast as Bolkovac. [...] "I was young and naïve," [...] Kondracki said of her initial attempts to secure funding. [...] "I thought: 'Of course they're going <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> film.

500|$|The album's climax {{is found}} in the title track, {{described}} by the artist as [...] "a personal breakthrough" [...] and is initially born out of a Grey Skies demo, [...] "Soft," [...] previously released on Ass-Sordid Demos II. [...] "Ki" [...] builds into a cyclical progression of arpeggios which Martin Popoff of Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles described as the album's [...] "proggiest" [...] moment. It leads into [...] "Quiet Riot", an acoustic version of [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize" [...] with new lyrics. [...] "Quiet Riot", Townsend explained, [...] "basically sums up the idea that, although I am 'damaged,' I'm fine, and have chosen <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> life better." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{needed to}} {{maintain}} a very strong relationship with Tommy [...] During that period, {{the beginning of their}} end, I had to stay away more than normal from her because she was going through a rough time. She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing of who she was. She felt that part of what she was dropping was the shmaltzy pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant about. I had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> exit and say 'Mariah, you need to redefine yourself, that's fine. I'm here doing what I do and if and when you want to come back and do it again, I'm here.|$|E
500|$|Barney did {{not take}} her poetry as seriously as Vivien did, saying, [...] "if I had one {{ambition}} it was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> life itself into a poem." [...] Her plays were only performed through amateur productions in her garden. According to Karla Jay, most of them lacked coherent plots and [...] "would probably baffle even the most sympathetic audience." [...] After 1910 she mostly wrote the epigrams and memoirs for which she is better known. Her last book of poetry was called Poems & Poemes: Autres Alliances and came out in 1920, bringing together romantic poetry in both French and English. Barney asked Ezra Pound to edit the poems but then ignored the detailed recommendations he made.|$|E

As I said, I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute... That's why I take this time to speak to you guys and let you know really what it is... I will tell you that I loved [...] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|E
500|$|... "Burroughs on Scientology" [...] is {{an opinion}} piece {{originally}} published in the Los Angeles Free Press on 6 March 1970. It begins [...] "In {{view of the fact}} that my articles and statements on Scientology may have influenced young people to associate themselves with the so called Church of Scientology, I feel an obligation <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> present views on the subject quite clear." [...] Burroughs states that some Scientology practices have value: [...] "Some of the techniques are highly valuable and warrant further study and experimentation." [...] He is critical of the Church of Scientology's organizational policy and organizations in general, and Scientology's attempts to keep many of its counseling methods secret, and writes [...] "On the other hand I am in flat disagreement with the organizational policy." ...|$|E

[...] and that {{directors}} Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, the movie itself, and actors Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, and Steve Carell deserved Oscar nominations. Joel Siegel issued a rarely awarded 'A' rating, saying that [...] "Orson Welles would have to come back to life for this not <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> year-end Top10 list." [...] Stella Papamichael of BBC News called the film [...] "a winning blend of sophistication and silliness".

500|$|Sheraton Kalouria, {{senior vice}} {{president}} of NBC's daytime programming, said that the show's racially diverse ensemble, as represented by the African American Russells and the Hispanic Lopez-Fitzgeralds, exemplified [...] "truly color-blind storytelling". Ross believed that Eve was not defined by identity as an African American: [...] "If they wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> character any other ethnicity they wouldn't have to change a thing about her... She's just a person." [...] The actress cited the show's racial diversity as a primary reason for her attraction to the role. She stated that she felt [...] "tremendous support from NBC and Passions that the black characters and/or Hispanic characters are all essential parts of the story". She has cited Eve as helping to expand the TV representation of African Americans and interracial relationships.|$|E
500|$|While {{many critics}} found the band's new sound refreshing, NME criticized the Chili Peppers for rarely using their {{trademark}} funk sound, asking: [...] "Can {{we have our}} brain-dead, half-dressed funk-hop rock animals back now, please? All this false empathy is starting <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> removed rib tingle." [...] Pitchfork, while considering the album a triumph over One Hot Minute, felt Californication lacked the funk that was ever-present in Blood Sugar Sex Magik. It went on to scrutinize some lyrics for being overly sexual, but also considered Frusciante to be [...] "the best big-time American rock guitarist going right now". Critic Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention rating, describing the band as [...] "New Age fuck fiends" [...] and citing [...] "Scar Tissue" [...] and [...] "Purple Stain" [...] as highlights.|$|E
500|$|Magnus's English {{accent was}} not well {{received}} by some critics. She was listed ninth in io9's [...] "Worst Fake Accents From The Yanks (And Canucks) Of Science Fiction", with Meredith Woerner stating [...] "I really want to like this new Sci Fi Channel show, especially since the monsters look amazing – but I'm worried Tapping's dreadful accent will get in the way. It sounds completely forced in all the clips I've seen so far, but I'll guess I'll {{have to wait until}} October 3 <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> full assessment." [...] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune wondered why Tapping decided to speak with an [...] "iffy accent," [...] but added she would be of interest by fans of Tapping's previous works, notably Stargate. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called Tapping's English accent [...] "unremarkable", whilst calling the show an [...] "unremarkable series." ...|$|E

So, I {{had no choice but}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> own beats to get that sound." [...] In an interview with Ozone Magazine, when asked about their music and the revival of the [...] "newer west" [...] movement, Ben J stated, [...] "Everything is becoming positive out here.

500|$|Amidst {{widespread}} rumors, Usher stated, [...] "People assume things, {{because as}} I said, I pull from my personal experiences <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> music." [...] He {{added that he}} loved Chilli, however, [...] "...it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash..." [...] Although [...] "Burn" [...] is a reference to his dying relationship with Chilli—hence the title—Usher answered the press that the impregnating issue was not taken from a specific situation in his life. He also revealed that his friends who went through similar situations inspired him to write those songs: [...] "...it's just something that I collectively got energy from everybody around me that had been through it." [...] In early 2006, Dupri revealed that {{the story behind the}} album is his: [...] "...me cheating on my steady girlfriend, having a baby with that other woman and having to confess to everything that happened to my main girl." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the 2012 London Olympics, Vijender {{spoke to}} The Wall Street Journal about the {{increasing}} government bias to boost cricket.

I’m working really hard <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> country proud. I hope someday my turn comes, too" [...] he clarified. Vijender was approached by Percept Picture Company {{to act as a}} guide and counsellor to participants taking part in the Indian version of the boxing reality show The Contender, which follows a group of boxers competing with each other in a single elimination style-competition. He agreed despite being still contractually obligated with Infinity Optimal Solutions (IOS), a celebrity management firm who dealt with his media appearances and ramp walks as a male model. IOS successfully petitioned the Delhi High Court to bar him from entering into any deal with Percept.|$|E
