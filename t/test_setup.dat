5|$|The latest {{proposed}} extremely large astronomical telescopes, {{such as the}} Thirty Meter Telescope and the Extremely Large Telescope, will be of segmented design. Their primary mirrors will be {{built from}} hundreds of hexagonal mirror segments. Polishing and figuring these highly aspheric and non-rotationally symmetric mirror segments presents a major challenge. Traditional means of optical testing compares a surface against a spherical reference {{with the aid of}} a null corrector. In recent years, computer-generated holograms (CGHs) have begun to supplement null correctors in test setups for complex aspheric surfaces. Fig.15 illustrates how this is done. Unlike the figure, actual CGHs have line spacing on the order of 1 to 10Âµm. When laser light is passed through the CGH, the zero-order diffracted beam experiences no wavefront modification. The wavefront of the first-order diffracted beam, however, is modified to match the desired shape of the test surface. In the illustrated Fizeau interferometer <b>test</b> <b>setup,</b> the zero-order diffracted beam is directed towards the spherical reference surface, and the first-order diffracted beam is directed towards the test surface in such a way that the two reflected beams combine to form interference fringes. The same <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> can be used for the innermost mirrors as for the outermost, with only the CGH needing to be exchanged.|$|E
25|$|Shaw and Edwards (aged 18 and 17, respectively, at {{the time}} Alpha started) were skilled amateur magicians who managed to fool the {{researchers}} with fairly simple tricks during the first stages of investigations. The project had originally started with spoon bending, so the two quickly developed a way to accomplish this. Contrary {{to one of the}} caveats Randi noted in his letter, the <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> included not one, but many and all sorts of spoons on the table, labeled with paper on a loop of string instead of some permanent marking. When starting to bend a spoon, they would actually pick up two or more and remove the labels, which they were allowed to do, because they claimed they were in the way. They would then simply switch the labels when putting them back and wait. The spoons were measured before and after the experiment, and since all sorts of spoons were used, simply switching the labels would produce different measurements, causing the scientist to believe that something paranormal had occurred. In other cases, they would drop one of the spoons in their lap and bend it below the table with one hand, while pretending to bend a spoon in their other hand, distracting the scientists.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} to completely eliminate errors in the detector and meter if a precision variable attenuator {{is used in the}} <b>test</b> <b>setup.</b> [...] In this technique a minimum is first found and the attenuator adjusted so that the meter is indicating precisely some convenient mark. [...] A maximum is then found and the attenuation increased until the meter is indicating the same mark. [...] The amount the attenuation had to be increased is the VSWR of the standing wave. [...] Accuracy here depends on the accuracy of the attenuator and not at all on the detector.|$|E

500|$|Slotted lines {{can measure}} {{standing}} waves, wavelength, and, with some calculation or plotting on Smith charts, {{a number of}} other parameters including reflection coefficient and electrical impedance. [...] A precision variable attenuator is often incorporated in the <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> to improve accuracy. [...] This is used to make level measurements, while the detector and VSWR meter are retained only to mark a reference point for the attenuator to be set to, thus eliminating entirely the detector and meter measurement errors. [...] The parameter most commonly measured by a slotted line is SWR. This serves as a measure of the accuracy of the impedance match to the item under test. [...] This is especially important for transmitting antennas and their feed lines; high standing wave ratio on a radio or TV antenna can distort the signal, increase transmission line loss and potentially damage components in the transmission path, possibly even the transmitter.|$|E
500|$|A typical <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> with a {{waveguide}} {{slotted line}} {{is shown in}} figure 2. [...] Referring to this figure, power from a test equipment source (not shown) [...] enters the apparatus through the co-axial cable on the left and is converted to waveguide format by means of a launcher (1). [...] This is followed by a section of waveguide (2) providing a transition to a smaller size of guide. [...] An important component in the setup is the isolator (3) which prevents power being reflected back into the source. [...] Depending on the test conditions, such reflections can be large and a high-power source may be damaged by the returning wave. [...] The power entering the slotted line is controlled by a rotary variable attenuator (4). [...] This is followed by the slotted line itself (5) above which is the probe mounted on a movable carriage. [...] The carriage also carries the probe adjustements: (6) is the probe depth adjustment, (7) is a length of co-axial section with tuning adjustments, and (8) is a crystal detector. [...] The right-hand end of the slotted line is terminated in a matched load (9) which absorbs all the power exiting the end of the waveguide. [...] The load can be replaced by the component or system that it is desired to test. [...] It can also be replaced with a reference short-circuit (10) which is used to calibrate the slotted line. [...] The carriage can be moved along the slotted line by means of a rotary knob (11) which simultaneously moves a vernier gauge (12) for accurate measurement of the probes position along the line.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1985, the Air Force tested an SDIO-funded {{deuterium}} fluoride laser known as Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser (MIRACL) at White Sands Missile Range.

After the SDIO closed, the MIRACL was tested on an old Air Force satellite for potential use as an anti-satellite weapon, with mixed results. The technology was also used to develop the Tactical High Energy Laser, (THEL) which is being tested to shoot down artillery shells.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a real-life-based {{evaluation}} method, incorporating vulnerable road user (VRU) full-body loading to a vehicle with a deployable protection system in relevant <b>test</b> <b>setups,</b> and use this method to evaluate a prototype pedestrian and cyclist protection system. Methods: Based on accident data from severe crashes, the most common scenarios were selected and developed into 5 <b>test</b> <b>setups,</b> 2 for pedestrians and 3 for bicyclists. The Polar II pedestrian anthropomorphic test device was used, either standing or on a standard bicycle. These <b>test</b> <b>setups</b> could then be used to evaluate real-life performance of a prototype protection system, regarding both positioning and protection, for vulnerable road users. The protection system consisted of an active hood and a windshield airbag and was mounted on a large passenger car with a conventional hood-type front end. Injury evaluation criteria were selected for head, neck, and chest loading derived from occupant frontal and side impact test methods. Results: The protection system managed to be fully deployed, obtaining the intended position in timeâthat is, before VRU body contactâin all <b>test</b> <b>setups,</b> and head protection potential was not negatively influenced by the preceding thoracic impact. Head loading resulted in head injury criterion (HIC) values ranging up to 4400 for the standard car, and all HIC values were below 650 with the protection system. The risk of severe (Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] 3 +) head injury decreased from 85 % to 100 % in 3 <b>test</b> <b>setups</b> (mainly to the windscreen frame), to less than a 20 % risk in all setups. In general, there were larger differences between structures impacted than between the pedestrian and cyclist setup. Neck loading was maintained at an acceptable level or was slightly decreased by the protection system, and chest loading was decreased from high values in 2 <b>test</b> <b>setups</b> in which the cyclist was impacted laterally with chest impact mainly to the hood area. Conclusions: A test method was developed to evaluate a more real-life-based test condition, as a complement to current component test methods. Being real-life based, including full-body loading, it is suggested as a complementary test method to the more simplified legal and rating component tests. Together these test methods will provide a more thorough evaluation of a protection system. The evaluated protection system performed well regarding both positioning and protection, indicating a capability to obtain the intended position in time with the potential to prevent the most common severe upper-body injuries of a pedestrian or cyclist in typical real-life accidents, without introducing negative side effects...|$|R
