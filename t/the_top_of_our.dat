It would require return to G-d by observing and honoring the Torah, and a consensus that the foundation of all must be the power of Torah. Repenting of baseless hatred, and wholehearted peace-seeking as obligated [...] would result in success {{because it would be}} close to G-d’s will. We must make amends toward the future that the power of the sanctity of Torah be at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> list of priorities, that 'the son of Yishai be at the lead.' If the will to improve materially will rest on Torah – then the Lord will shine His face upon us and crown our every deed with success. At first, the salvation will be gradual, as our holy Rabbis remarked upon witnessing daybreak over the valley of Arbel, but after it will gain momentum, appearing as a great and wondrous light, as in the days of our exodus from Egypt.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{session was}} the {{definite}} one; either they {{would continue to}} work with the group or break up their relationship. Wilson recalled, [...] "Every previous time we'd met up with the girls we had prepared a backing track. This time we had nothing." [...] Watkins also said, [...] "They said they wanted to do something up and a bit of fun, so we just off <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> heads started {{to come up with a}} full-on disco backing track, which became 'Who Do You Think You Are'." [...] Wilson said of the song, [...] "The thing is when they wrote it, they were also writing the dance routine, constructing the music video, all at the same time as writing the song. And that's when the penny dropped." [...] The girls went on to write [...] "Something Kinda Funny", [...] "Last Time Lover" [...] and [...] "Naked" [...] with Watkins and Wilson, none of them singles, but all of them tracks which lent a touch of classy R feel to the Spice album. Absolute also produced all of these songs as well as the two tracks penned with Eliot Kennedy: [...] "Say You'll Be There" [...] and [...] "Love Thing" [...] giving the duo a guiding hand in six of the ten tracks that eventually ended up on Spice. The tracks that Absolute produced were recorded for the most part at Olympic Studios in Barnes. At this time, 1995, the Auto-Tune facility had yet to come to the market and most of the vocals were recorded with few adjustments made afterwards. Absolute told Simon Fuller about the group they had worked with and asked whether he would consider managing them. Fuller received a demo of [...] "Something Kinda Funny", one of the songs the group wrote with Absolute. He showed interest in the group, began a relationship and decided to sign them at 19 Management in March 1995. In September 1995 the group signed a deal with Virgin Records, and continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while touring the west coast of the United States, where they signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific in November.|$|E
