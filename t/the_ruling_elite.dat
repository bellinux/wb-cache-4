In reflection of their success, emperors gave merchants the right to become members of the Senate, that is to integrate themselves with <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>elite.</b> This had an end {{by the end of}} the eleventh century when political machinations allowed the landed aristocracy to secure the throne for a century and more.

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, Middle Scots, often simply called English, became the {{dominant}} {{language of the}} country.

Different social systems and cultures developed in the lowland and highland regions of the country as Gaelic remained the most common language north of the Tay and Middle Scots dominated in the south, where it became the language of <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>elite,</b> government and a new national literature. There were significant changes in religion which saw mendicant friars and new devotions expand, particularly in the developing burghs.|$|E
5|$|The ruling Vikings of Dublin were {{expelled}} from the city in 902 by a joint force led by Máel Finnia mac Flannacán, overking of Brega and Cerball mac Muirecáin, overking of Leinster. Those Vikings that survived the capture of the city split into different groups; some went to France, some to England, and some to Wales. Archaeological evidence suggests Dublin remained occupied {{in the years immediately}} following this expulsion, perhaps indicating only <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>elite</b> were forced to leave. However, Viking raids on Irish settlements continued, and in 914, a large Viking fleet travelled to Waterford. The arrival of this fleet marked the re-establishment of Viking rule over parts of Ireland, and was followed by more Vikings settling in Limerick the following year.|$|E

Cornelia ensured the brothers had the best available Greek tutors, teaching them oratory and political science. The brothers were also well trained in martial pursuits; in horsemanship and combat they outshone all their peers. The older brother Tiberius was elected an augur at only 16 – according to the historian J.C. Stobart, had he taken the easy path rather than the cause of radical reform, {{he would have been}} clearly destined for consulship. Tiberius was the most distinguished young officer in the Third Punic War, Rome's last campaign against Carthage. He was the first to scale Carthage's walls; before that he saved an army of 20,000 men by skilled diplomacy.

5|$|Japanese {{cultural}} properties {{were originally}} in {{the ownership of}} Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, and aristocratic or samurai families. Feudal Japan ended abruptly in 1867/68 when the Tokugawa shogunate {{was replaced by the}} Meiji Restoration. During the ensuing haibutsu kishaku ("abolish Buddhism and destroy Shākyamuni") triggered by the official policy of separation of Shinto and Buddhism and anti-Buddhist movements propagating the return to Shinto, Buddhist buildings and artwork were destroyed. In 1871, the government confiscated temple lands, considered symbolic of <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>elite.</b> Properties belonging to the feudal lords were expropriated, historic castles and residences were destroyed, and an estimated 18,000 temples were closed. During the same period, Japanese cultural heritage was impacted by the rise of industrialization and westernization. As a result, Buddhist and Shinto institutions became impoverished. Temples decayed, and valuable objects were exported.|$|E
40|$|This policy brief {{attempts}} to challenge three popular views on China. Firstly, it contends {{that it is}} the political calculation of <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>elites,</b> rather than <b>the</b> process of modernization, that determines the pace of political liberalization. By examining how Chinese <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> view political reform and adapt to socio-economic change, it argues that economic growth can retard political liberalization in the short term. Secondly, the brief argues that the imperative to preserve the political monopoly of a one-party system overrides the desire for a fully marketized economy; and determines the strategy of economic reform. This perspective provides an understanding as to why the Chinese government has opted for gradualism in reform, and why such a process has enabled <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> to protect <b>the</b> most critical economic sectors from market competition. Thirdly, instead of fostering a developmental state, the combination of one-party rule and semi-finished economic reform creates fertile conditions for local <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> to engage in decentralized predation, undermining governance and creating systemic risks.

40|$|This {{paper has}} two objectives. First, it {{presents}} {{a survey of the}} literature surrounding the relation between political monopoly and economic development. Second, it offers an analysis of how commoners' high degree of tolerance towards unfair inequality of income distribution between theirs and <b>the</b> monopolizing <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> leads to poor economic development. We assert that free migration between states causes monopoly rent to shrink because it poses a threat to <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>elites</b> due to fiscal competition between states. The shrinking in monopoly rent implies a higher level of division of labour, which results in a greater extent of the market and higher aggregate productivity.

Violence continued over the coming weeks, and on 1 July a group of armed men, under the command of John de Gisbourne, forced their way into the city and attempted to seize control. The mayor, Simon de Quixlay, gradually began to reclaim authority, but order was not properly restored until 1382. The news of the southern revolt reached Scarborough where riots broke out against <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>elite</b> on 23 June, with the rebels dressed in white hoods with a red tail at the back. Members of the local government were deposed from office, and one tax collector was nearly lynched. By 1382 the elite had re-established power.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Mesoamerica, the Maya {{believed}} in a supernatural realm inhabited by an array of powerful deities. These deities needed to be placated with ceremonial offerings and ritual practices. At the core of Maya religious practice was the worship of deceased ancestors, who would act as go-betweens for their living descendants in dealings with the denizens of the supernatural realm. The earliest intermediaries between humans and the supernatural realm were shamans. Maya ritual included the use of hallucinogens for chilan (oracular) priests. Visions for the chilan were likely facilitated by consumption of water lilies, which are hallucinogenic in high doses. As the Maya civilization developed, <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>elite</b> codified the general concepts held by Maya society, and developed them into religious cults that justified their right to rule. In the Late Preclassic, the pinnacle of this process was the combination of ultimate political and religious power in the divine king, the k'uhul ajaw. Although it is difficult to reconstruct the belief system through archaeology, some indicators of ritual practice do leave physical traces. These include dedicatory caches and other ritual deposits, shrines, and burials and their associated funerary offerings. In addition, Maya art, architecture, and writing all assist in the reconstruction of ancient Maya beliefs; these can be combined with ethnographic sources, including records of Maya religious practices made by the Spanish during the conquest.|$|E
