5|$|In Mission: Earth, Voyage to the Home Planet, {{astronaut}} Thomas David Jones recounts {{his experiences}} studying the Earth {{during his first}} mission with the United States space agency NASA. Jones' space mission lasted eleven days. Jones {{was a member of}} the crew of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which left Earth in April 1994. The mission was intended to provide the Space Radar Lab with a view of the planet. By using three separate radar echoes, scientists were able to analyze a full image of the planet. The radar <b>technology</b> <b>could</b> penetrate obstructions, including clouds and thick outgrowth of trees. Another purpose of the mission was to analyze the ecological state of the planet and to take measurements of pollution caused by carbon monoxide.|$|E
5|$|Wary of the {{potential}} dangers (particularly {{the possibility of a}} prolific bacteria with a viral cancer-causing gene), the scientific community as well as a wide range of scientific outsiders reacted to these developments with both enthusiasm and fearful restraint. Prominent molecular biologists led by Berg suggested a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA research until the dangers could be assessed and policies could be created. This moratorium was largely respected, until the participants in the 1975 Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA created policy recommendations and concluded that the <b>technology</b> <b>could</b> be used safely.|$|E
5|$|Extraterrestrial <b>technology</b> <b>could</b> have {{profound}} {{impacts on the}} nature of human culture and civilization. Just as television provided a new outlet {{for a wide variety of}} political, religious, and social groups, and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe, allowing them to interpret it for themselves, so an extraterrestrial technology might change humanity in ways not immediately apparent. Harrison speculates that a knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress, leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate for negative effects of technology. He gives the example of improvements in agricultural technology during the Industrial Revolution, which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to the new social order. Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything previously experienced by humanity.|$|E
30|$|In addition, {{many other}} mobility-unrelated {{technologies}} can also support {{the development of}} smart learning environments. For example, Analytics <b>technologies</b> <b>could</b> combine a student’s personal aspirations in assessing {{the value of a}} prescribed learning opportunity (Simpao et al. [2014]; Tannahill and Jamshidi [2014]). Social-awareness <b>technologies</b> <b>could</b> relate an individual’s experience with that of the crowd in establishing groups (Bardram and Hansen [2010]).|$|R

5|$|The {{background}} {{to the development}} of the Dorchester Hotel is complicated. Sir Malcolm McAlpine, a partner in the building company, Sir Robert McAlpine & Sons, and Sir Frances Towle, the managing director of Gordon Hotels Ltd., shared a vision of creating the 'perfect hotel': ultramodern and ultra-efficient, with all the conveniences modern <b>technology</b> <b>could</b> supply. The two companies purchased Hertford House in 1929 and quickly demolished it. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had also shown an interest in purchasing it and had almost done so prior to the McAlpine acquisition, but instead they turned their attention to Foley House. The purchase and destruction of Hertford House was part of significant redevelopment which took place on Park Lane during this period; it followed the gutting of Grosvenor House and the building of the Grosvenor House Hotel, which was completed in 1929.|$|E
5|$|The prime universe's Peter succumbs to {{his illness}} and dies, and Walter {{and his wife}} Elizabeth (Orla Brady) mourn their loss, {{supported}} by Walter and William's friend, Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) and Walter's lab assistant, Carla Warren (Jenni Blong). Walter, through his window, shows Elizabeth the other Peter, and asserts they should be happy knowing another Peter exists. Later, Walter watches Walternate explore other cures. Walternate is distracted {{by the arrival of}} an Observer, September (Michael Cerveris), and fails to see the telltale color change indicating a cure. Walter is able to recreate and stabilize Walternate's cure, and then decides to use untested equipment to cross over to give the cure to Peter. Carla tries to stop Walter, knowing the <b>technology</b> <b>could</b> damage the fabric of space-time, and contacts Nina for help. Separately, September informs his fellow Observers that he may have made a mistake and assures them he will correct it.|$|E

40|$|International audienceResearchers {{have proven}} with both {{theoretical}} and empirical studies that <b>technologies</b> <b>could</b> enhance learning. Meanwhile, <b>technologies</b> <b>could</b> also create barriers to the latter. Particularly, when the use of technologies causes security and privacy concerns, E-learning becomes less fruitful as the participants are too afraid to be exposed by what has been provided to help them learn in the first place. This paper presents a study on user's perception in using E-learning technologies and the relevant issues. The major contribution {{of this paper is}} the awareness-raising of security and privacy issues, which are often overlooked in the research efforts that implicate user tracking and personal data usage for instructional purposes...|$|R
