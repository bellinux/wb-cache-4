5|$|NY129 was {{designated}} in 1908 as {{a section of}} Route2, a legislative route designated by the New York State Legislature. However, in 1921, the route was realigned off the route that would become NY129 in favor of NY9A. Nine years later, the state designated the route as NY129 during the state highway renumbering. The route originally followed a route used by NY131 once the routes were swapped in the 1940s, with NY131 being decommissioned soon after. NY129 was extended to end at a <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> with NY100 in the hamlet of Pines Bridge. This lasted up to at least 1969, when the designation was truncated back to NY118, which was extended to the <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> instead. The <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> in Pines Bridge was removed by 1991. Originally, NY129 had an interchange with the Taconic, but the ramps were removed in 1969 and a new interchange was built on nearby Underhill Road.|$|E
5|$|Planning for {{the removal}} of the Stoney Creek <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> was {{completed}} by 1970, and reconstruction began in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in May 1999, the grade-separated <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> {{junction}} with Erin Mills Parkway and Southdown Road, which dated back to {{the early}} 1960s, was completely reconstructed as a standard parclo A4 interchange; it was reopened in 2001.|$|E
50|$|The {{experience}} with <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> and rotaries in the USA was almost entirely negative, characterized by high accident rates and congestion problems. By the mid 1950s, construction of <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> and rotaries had ceased entirely. The {{experience with}} <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> {{in other countries}} was not much better until {{the development of the}} modern roundabout in the United Kingdom during the 1960s.|$|R
25|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>circles</b> are {{typically}} larger, operate at higher speeds and often {{give priority to}} entering traffic. They may control entering traffic by stop signs or traffic lights. Many older <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> allow entry at higher speeds without deflection, or require a stop and a 90-degree turn to enter.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> {{were built}} {{throughout}} the state because they were viewed as {{an efficient way to}} move traffic through three or more intersecting roads. As suburban and rural populations grew, the <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> became outdated because increased vehicle speed and traffic volume caused them to be more dangerous. Many <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> became notorious for having frequent accidents and being confusing, especially for non-locals. Part of the confusion has arisen because a circle is comprised as a series of uncontrolled intersections, so the driver to the right (entering the circle) has the right of way. Since the 1970s, the NJDOT has begun phasing out <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> by building a road through the <b>circle,</b> adding <b>traffic</b> signals, adding grade separation, or converting the circle into a modern roundabout.|$|R
5|$|Work {{continued}} {{on the four}} lane bridge approach throughout 1941, and by mid-1942 {{it was possible to}} drive directly from the bridge onto the QEW. The new link featured a <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> at Dorchester Road {{as well as at the}} QEW.|$|E
5|$|East of {{the airport}} {{in the town of}} Massena, NY37 begins to {{parallel}} the north bank of the Raquette River as it intersects NY37C near a hamlet named for the waterway. NY37 and the river continue northeast to the vicinity of the hamlet of Rooseveltown, where NY37 formerly connected to a large <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> linking NY37 to the Three Nations Crossing as well as County Route45 (CR45). The <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> has since been replaced with a T-intersection and traffic light because of the expansion of the American Customs facility. Upon crossing into Franklin County and the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation a short distance to the east, the road narrows back to a two-lane undivided highway and crosses over the Raquette River.|$|E
5|$|In North White Plains, {{the area}} that the road passes through becomes a little less {{developed}} as it goes over a gentle rise from which a short connector runs downhill to the <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> where the BRP ends and the Taconic State Parkway begins, just south of Kensico Dam.|$|E
2500|$|Welkom is {{well known}} for its {{efficient}} road traffic design mainly through the use of <b>traffic</b> <b>circles,</b> which has been the basis of worldwide studies. [...] This is encouraged by flow design, the minimum of stop streets and the total absence of traffic lights and parking meters in the Central Business District. There are currently 33 large <b>traffic</b> <b>circles.</b>|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 33 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 7 - 10 July 2014 "Leading Transport into the Future", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. National and international literature generally promotes <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> (roundabouts) as safe, efficient and cost effective alternatives to priority and signalised intersections. Research was conducted in eThekwini to evaluate the role of <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> in constrained urban environments. When priority intersections start experiencing high delays, local authorities are typically faced with the choice of replacing these intersections with <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> or <b>traffic</b> signals. The objective of the research was to quantify and compare the costs, environmental impacts (emissions), safety record and capacity of <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> versus <b>traffic</b> signals when the ability to expropriate additional land is both expensive and difficult. In such a scenario, are <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> {{able to be a}} competitive alternative to traffic signals? The research shows that, surprisingly, based on the above mentioned evaluation criteria, traffic signals still seem to offer both a safer and more cost effective option than <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> once the intersection reaches the traffic volumes that would warrant traffic signals.

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of a general increase of activity in Port of New York and New Jersey and new development on West Side and Hackensack Riverfront studies are being conducted to make the intersection with Route 440 a multi-level <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> and northern and southern (Route 440) approaches to it into a multi-use urban boulevard that includes grade separations and additional medians.|$|E
5|$|NY118 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, it did not initially follow any of its modern alignment. Instead, NY118 headed northeastward from its current southern terminus on modern NY100 and US202 to a terminus at NY22 in Croton Falls while all of what is now NY118 was part of NY100. At the time, NY100 continued north along Baldwin Place Road and Myrtle Avenue to meet then-US6 near Mahopac Falls. In June 1934, the portion of NY118 between Somers and Croton Falls became concurrent to US202, a new interstate route extending from Delaware to Maine. The alignments of NY100 and NY118 north of New Croton Reservoir were flipped , placing NY118 on its modern alignment. NY118 initially continued north to NY6N over NY100's original alignment; however, this extension was eliminated in the mid-1940s. With the flip, NY118 terminated at a junction with NY129 in Croton Lake, while the latter extended to a <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> with NY100 in the hamlet of Pines Bridge. This alignment remained until , when the route was extended over the easternmost piece of NY129 to end at the <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> with NY100. The <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> in Pines Bridge was removed between 1988 and 1991 and replaced with a three-way intersection between the two routes.|$|E
5|$|The circle itself dated back to {{construction}} in 1938. The circle itself could not handle the 17,000 vehicles {{a year that}} use the large roadway daily, and {{was the site of}} several accidents, including 45 in 2007 alone. The entire <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> conversion will eliminate two businesses in the area and is still slated for construction.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Department of Transportation {{adopted the}} term modern {{roundabout}} to distinguish those that require entering drivers {{to give way}} to others. This article follows that convention and refers to other types as <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> or rotaries. Many old <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> remain in the northeastern US. Some modern roundabouts are elongated to encompass additional streets, but traffic always flows in a loop.|$|R

50|$|New Jersey {{had been}} quite fond of <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> {{starting}} in 1927, when the Airport Circle in Pennsauken Township opened to traffic on July 1, 1927, as the first such traffic rotary in the United States. While the state had as many as 67 <b>traffic</b> <b>circles</b> at its peak, projects initiated by the NJDOT since the mid-1970s had reduced the count to 37 by 1999.|$|R
5|$|In March 2009, {{construction}} {{began on}} {{the reconstruction of the}} bridge that carries MD 139 (Charles Street) over I-695. The bridge will be decorative, featuring ornamental street lights. As part of the MD 139 project, the interchange will be reconstructed and the <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> at the MD 139/I-695 ramps will be removed and replaced with a traffic signal. This project is expected to cost $50 million and be completed in 2012.|$|E
5|$|South of here, the Route 413 {{continues}} as a divided highway with one lane {{in each direction}} passing through an area of commercial businesses. The road comes to another oblong <b>traffic</b> <b>circle,</b> with intersections at Oakland Avenue, Washington Avenue, and Lincoln Avenue. One house and two businesses are located along {{the eastern edge of}} the circle. South of this circle, Route 413 ends at a complex intersection with US130 (on which County Route 543 runs concurrently), Taylor Avenue, Salem Road, and Mott Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{dates back}} to the designations of State Highway Route 31, which was main north–south highway in New Jersey. The Netcong Circle, a <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> in Netcong between NJ 183 and U.S. Route 46 was present for the entire {{lifetime}} of NJ 183 until it was replaced by a signalized intersection in 2013. A nearby bridge over a New Jersey Transit line was also replaced.|$|E

5|$|Route 413 {{begins at}} the state line, midway along the BurlingtonBristol Bridge, as a {{continuation}} of PA413. As the road descends from the bridge, a toll booth spans {{the width of the}} road though a toll is only collected for westbound traffic. The highway heads southward, heading along Keim Boulevard, and becomes maintained by Burlington County. For eastbound traffic, a right-in/right-out intersection with Veterans Drive is present while for westbound traffic, an exit for Reed Street is located before the toll booths. South of here, an oblong <b>traffic</b> <b>circle,</b> bisected by the River Line railroad, is found and has intersections with West Broad Street.|$|E
5|$|SR 92 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Fry Boulevard in Sierra Vista. SR 90 is the designation along the roads heading {{north and east}} from the intersection. From here, SR 92 heads south through Sierra Vista, passing by residential areas in a desert terrain. The road then passes through the town of Nicksville while {{the west side of}} the route is flanked by the Coronado National Forest, in which Huachuca Mountains are located. SR 92 then turns eastward, passing within several miles within the Mexico–United States border. The route passes the town of Palominas before turning northeast. The roadway enters the town of Bisbee, meeting its terminus at a <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> in the city.|$|E
5|$|State {{maintenance}} resumes {{once again}} as SR 275 crosses the Sacramento River on the Tower Bridge, a four-lane lift bridge that formerly carried a Sacramento Northern Railroad {{track in the}} center. At {{the east end of}} the bridge, the roadway becomes Capitol Mall, maintained by the city of Sacramento, and crosses over Interstate 5. Seven blocks later, the main road ends at 9th Street; the last block of Capitol Mall to 10th Street, on which the State Capitol fronts, is a two-lane road with a mid-block <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> around a fountain.|$|E

5|$|This {{interchange}} {{was originally}} a <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> that was removed {{in the early}} 1970s. The numerous lanes from the stack interchange to the west begin to converge between residential subdivisions east of Dorchester Road, gradually narrowing to four through lanes at the Drummond Road interchange. After passing beneath Portage Road, the route widens on approach to an at-grade intersection with Stanley Avenue. This intersection is {{the eastern end of}} both the freeway segment of the route and the signed King's Highway 420; east of Stanley Avenue the route is signed as Niagara Regional Road420 and known as Falls Avenue.|$|E
5|$|At this point, DE 18 heads east {{concurrent}} with DE 404 along Seashore Highway {{through a}} mix of farmland and woodland with some residences, crossing the Nanticoke River and passing through tracts of the Redden State Forest. Farther east, DE 18/DE 404 heads into Georgetown, running {{to the north of}} Delaware Technical Community College's Jack F. Owens Campus. The road intersects US 113 and the western terminus of DE 404 Truck in a commercial area and continues east. The two routes head southeast onto North Bedford Street, passing homes and businesses. The road intersects US 9 at a <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> called The Circle in the center of Georgetown, where the Sussex County Courthouse is located. Here, DE 18 reaches its eastern terminus.|$|E
5|$|Entering Folsom in Atlantic County, US 322 {{passes a}} couple lakes and some wooded residences {{before coming to}} an {{interchange}} with Route 54, where the route has a median. Past this interchange, the road continues southeast through heavily forested areas to an intersection with the southern terminus of Route 73 (signed as County Route 561 Spur). After this intersection, US 322 turns south and enters Hamilton Township, where it encounters County Route 559 at a <b>traffic</b> <b>circle</b> that has been modified to have US 322 run through it. After passing more woods and a clearing for farms, the road widens into a four-lane divided highway and has an interchange with Route 50. A short while after, the route enters a residential and commercial area, passing by Atlantic Cape Community College before heading {{to the south of}} the Hamilton Mall. Here, US 322 intersects U.S. Route 40, which merges onto the Black Horse Pike.|$|E
