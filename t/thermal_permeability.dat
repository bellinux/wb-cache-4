40|$|International audienceAn {{acoustic}} method {{based on}} sound transmission is proposed for deducing the static <b>thermal</b> <b>permeability</b> and the inertial factor of porous materials having a rigid frame at low frequencies. The static <b>thermal</b> <b>permeability</b> of porous material is a geometrical parameter {{equal to the}} inverse trapping constant of the solid frame [Lafarge et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 102, 1995 (1997) ] and is an important characteristic of the porous material. The inertial factor [Norris., J. Wave Mat. Interact. 1, 22 365 (1986) ] describes the fluid structure interactions in the low frequency range (1 - 3 kHz). The proposed method {{is based on a}} temporal model of the direct and inverse scattering problems for the propagation of transient audible frequency waves in a homogeneous isotropic slab of porous material having a rigid frame. The static <b>thermal</b> <b>permeability</b> and the inertial factor are determined from the solution of the inverse problem. The minimization between experiment and theory is made in the time domain. Tests are performed using industrial plastic foams. Experimental and theoretical data are in good agreement.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} transport parameters (diffusion, dynamic permeability, <b>thermal</b> <b>permeability,</b> trapping constant) of porous media by combining the homogenization of periodic media (HPM) and the self-consistent scheme (SCM) based on a bicomposite spherical pattern. The link between the HPM and SCM approaches is first established by using a systematic argument independent of the problem under consideration. It is shown that the periodicity condition can be replaced by zero flux and energy through the whole surface of the representative elementary volume. Consequently the SCM solution {{can be considered as}} a geometrical approximation of the local problem derived through HPM for materials such that the morphology of the period is "close" to the SCM pattern. These results are then applied to derive the estimates of the effective diffusion, the dynamic permeability, the <b>thermal</b> <b>permeability</b> and the trapping constant of porous media. These SCM estimates are compared with numerical HPM results obtained on periodic arrays of spheres and polyhedrons. It is shown that SCM estimates provide good analytical approximations of the effective parameters for periodic packings of spheres at porosities larger than 0. 6, while the agreement is excellent for periodic packings of polyhedrons in the whole range of porosity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} sound {{propagation}} in rigid porous media is investigated. Two so-called scaling functions {{are introduced to}} describe the dynamic viscous and thermal interaction of the pore fluid and the porous structure.

40|$|Modeling {{of sound}} {{propagation}} in porous media requires {{the knowledge of}} several intrinsic material parameters, {{some of which are}} difficult or impossible to measure directly, particularly {{in the case of a}} porous medium which is composed of pores with a wide range of scales and random interconnections. Four particular parameters which are rarely measured non-acoustically, but used extensively in a number of acoustical models, are the viscous and thermal characteristic lengths, <b>thermal</b> <b>permeability,</b> and Pride parameter. The main purpose of this work is to show how these parameters relate to the pore size distribution which is a routine characteristic measured non-acoustically. This is achieved through the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of four analytical models which have been developed previously to predict the dynamic density and/or compressibility of the equivalent fluid in a porous medium. In this work the models proposed by Johnson, Koplik, and Dashn [J. Fluid Mech. 176, 379 – 402 (1987) ], Champoux and Allard [J. Appl.

40|$|In {{the present}} study a {{relaxation}} approach to modelling sound propagation in porous media has been developed. A frequency domain model has been formulated and is shown to allow an analytical transformation of the governing equations in the time domain. The model proposed {{is an extension of}} an earlier work by Wilson at al. (1997) and is based on the use of two relaxation times. The model presented requires a set of six measurable parameters, e. g. static flow resistivity, porosity, tortuosity, <b>thermal</b> <b>permeability,</b> viscous and thermal characteristic lengths. It will be shown that the model satisfies the physically correct low and high frequency limits evaluated by Johnson et al. (1987) and therefore allows the prediction of a porous material's behaviour {{in a wide range of}} frequencies (and pulse durations when used in time domain). It will also be demonstrated that two different model formulations are necessary depending on the material shape factor values and physical reasons for this are identified. The model has been validated by performing laboratory measurements and numerical simulations in both frequency and time domains for a range of granular and fibrous porous materials. The well-known equivalent fluid model by Johnson et al. (1987), Champoux and Allard (1991) and Lafarge et al. (1997) has been formulated analytically in the time domain and its predictions are compared with those of the relaxation model and the data.

40|$|The insect {{exoskeleton}} is a multifunctional {{coat with}} {{a continuum of}} mechanical and structural properties constituting the barrier between electromagnetic waves and the internal body parts. This paper examines the ability of beetle exoskeleton to regulate internal body temperature considering its <b>thermal</b> <b>permeability</b> or isolation to simulated solar irradiance and infrared radiation. Seven Neotropical species of dung beetles (Coleoptera, Scarabaeinae) differing in colour, surface sculptures, size, sexual dimorphism, period of activity, guild category and altitudinal distribution were studied. Specimens were repeatedly subjected to heating trials under simulated solar irradiance and infrared radiation using a halogen neodymium bulb light with a balanced daylight spectrum and a ceramic infrared heat emitter. The volume of exoskeleton and its weight per volume unit were significantly {{more important for the}} heating rate {{at the beginning of the}} heating process than for the asymptotic maximum temperature reached at the end of the trials: larger beetles with relatively thicker exoskeletons heated more slowly. The source of radiation greatly influences the asymptotic temperature reached, but has a negligible effect in determining the rate of heat gain by beetles: they reached higher temperatures under artificial sunlight than under infrared radiation. Interspecific differences were negligible in the heating rate but had a large magnitude effect on the asymptotic temperature, only detectable under simulated sun irradiance. The fact that sun irradiance is differentially absorbed dorsally and transformed into heat among species opens the possibility that differences in dorsal exoskeleton would facilitate the heat gain under restrictive environmental temperatures below the preferred ones. The findings provided by this study support the important role played by the exoskeleton in the heating process of beetles, a cuticle able to act passively in the thermal control of body temperature without implying energetic costs and metabolic changes.

40|$|Shoddy fibres or"Shoddies" are {{a mixture}} of {{post-consumer}} and post-industrial fibres diverted from textile waste streams and recycled into their raw fibre form. They have found widespread use as a raw material for manufacturing sound absorbers that include, {{but are not limited}} to: automotive, architectural and home appliance applications. The purpose of this project is to develop a simple acoustic model to describe the acoustic behaviour of sound absorbers composed primarily of Shoddy fibres. The model requires knowledge of the material's bulk density only. To date, these materials have not been the focus of much published research and acoustical designers must rely on models that were developed for other materials or are overly complex. For modelling purposes, an equivalent fluid approach is chosen to balance complexity and accuracy. In deriving the proposed model, several popular equivalent fluid models are selected and the required input parameters for each model identified. The models are: the model of Delaney and Bazley, two models by Miki, the model of Johnson in conjunction with the model of Champoux and Allard and the model of Johnson in conjunction with the model of Lafarge. Characterization testing is carried out on sets of Shoddy absorbers produced using three different manufacturing methods. The measured properties are open porosity, tortuosity, airflow resistivity, the viscous and thermal characteristic lengths and the static <b>thermal</b> <b>permeability.</b> Empirical relationships between model parameters and bulk density are then derived and used to populate the selected models. This yields several"simplified" models with bulk density as the only parameter. The most accurate model is then selected by comparing each model's prediction to the results of normal incidence sound absorption tests. The model of Johnson-Lafarge populated with the empirical relations is the most accurate model over the range of frequencies considered (approx. 300 Hz - 4000 Hz) Characterization testing yields specific values for intrinsic material parameters that allow for comparison to other porous materials. Individual parameter relations allow users to substitute measured or theoretical values as needed. A new empirical acoustical model is proposed to describe the behaviour of Shoddy-based fibre absorbers. The model requires knowledge of the bulk density only. This parameter is easily measured making application of the model elementary...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNumerical {{simulation}} is used {{to present}} the spatial and temporal evolution of the temperature, the moisture content, the energy density and the instantaneous power in a fixed bed of zeolite beads during water adsorption. The sensitivity of the released energy density to some parameters (reactor geometry, feed relative humidity and temperature, kinetic coefficient, wall heat transfer coefficient, axial mass and <b>thermal</b> dispersion, <b>permeability)</b> is analyzed. To obtain optimal performances from the fixed- bed reactor and to meet the heating needs of a building, balance has to be found between the latter variables since they have an influence on the discharge duration and the power levels obtained...|$|R

The primary velocity {{is found to}} increase due to increase in parametric values of <b>thermal</b> diffusion, <b>permeability</b> parameter, while the increase in Schmidt number and chemical reaction parameter decrease the flow rate. It is also seen that, the mass transfer rate accelerates {{under the influence of}} Schmidt number and chemical reaction parameter, whereas the skin-friction increases as thermal diffusion parameter increases and decreases due to increase in chemical reaction parameter...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of cementitious grouts {{has been investigated}} {{in order to determine}} suitability of these materials for grouting vertical boreholes used with geothermal heat pumps. The roles of mix variables such as water/cement ratio, sand/cement ratio and superplasticizer dosage were measured. The cement-sand grouts were also tested for rheological characteristics, bleeding, permeability, bond to HDPE pipe, shrinkage, coefficient of thermal expansion, exotherm, durability and environmental impact. This paper summarizes the <b>thermal</b> conductivity, <b>permeability,</b> bonding and exotherm data for selected cementitious grouts. The theoretical reduction in bore length that could be achieved with the BNL-developed cement-sand grouts is examined. Finally, the FY 98 research and field trials are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fabric {{material}} {{plays an}} important role in the thermal comfort of Abaya because it is the outer garment of Muslim women. Abaya is black in colour and covers the whole body except the hands, feet and face. It is mandatory to wear Abaya in the Saudi Arabia and certain parts of Middle East countries irrespective of the outside environmental temperature which could be up to 45 °C. Therefore, the thermal transmission characteristics of the abaya are extremely important as human body responds to the external thermal environment through clothing. In a hot environment, it is extremely uncomfortable to wear several layers of clothing under the Abaya. Hence it is essential to enhance the thermal comfort of fabrics used for Abaya. This study investigated five selected knitted fabrics that could be used as Abaya fabrics for <b>thermal</b> resistance, air <b>permeability,</b> <b>thermal</b> comfort and vapour resistance. The results indicated that the fabrics with different knit structures, fibre composition and fabric weight have greater influence on thermal comfort performance...|$|R
40|$|Porous {{sintered}} microstructures {{are critical}} to the functioning of passive heat transport devices such as heat pipes. The topology and microstructure of the porous wick {{play a crucial role}} in determining the thermal performance of such devices. Three sintered copper wick samples employed in commercial heat pipes are characterized in this work in terms of their thermal transport properties––porosity, effective <b>thermal</b> conductivity, <b>permeability,</b> and interfacial heat transfer coefficient. The commercially available samples of nearly identical porosities (61 % open volume) are CT scanned at 5. 5 lm resolution, and the resulting image stack is reconstructed to produce high-quality finite volume meshes representing the solid and interstitial pore regions, with a conformal mesh at the interface separating these two regions. The resulting mesh is then employed for numerical analysis of thermal transport through fluid-saturated porous sintered beds. Multiple realizations are employed for statistically averaging out the randomness exhibited by the samples under consideration. The effective <b>thermal</b> conductivity and <b>permeability</b> data are compared with analytical models developed for spherical particle beds. The dependence of effective thermal conductivity of sintered samples on the extent of sintering is quantified. The interfacial heat transfer coefficient is compared against a correlation from the literature based on experimental data obtained with spherical particle beds. A modified correlation is proposed to match the results obtained...|$|R

40|$|Measurements on hydrate-bearing {{laboratory}} and field samples are {{necessary in order}} to provide realistic bounds on parameters used in numerically modeling the production of natural gas from hydrate-bearing reservoirs. The needed parameters include <b>thermal</b> conductivity, <b>permeability,</b> relative permeability-saturation(s) relationships, and capillary pressure-saturation(s) relationships. We have developed a technique to make hydrate-bearing samples ranging in scale from core plug-size to core-size in the laboratory to facilitate making these measurements. In addition to pressure and temperature measurements, we use x-ray computed tomography scanning to provide high-resolution data providing insights on processes occurring in our samples. Several methods are available to make gas hydrates in the laboratory, and we expect that the method used to make the hydrate will impact the behavior of the hydrate sample, and the parameters measured...|$|R

A quantitative de-scription of the emissions of reactive gases by snow requires knowledge of snow physical properties. This overview de-tails our current understanding of how those physical proper-ties relevant to snow photochemistry vary during snow meta-morphism. Properties discussed are density, specific surface area, <b>thermal</b> conductivity, <b>permeability,</b> gas diffusivity and optical properties. Inasmuch as possible, equations to pa-rameterize these properties as functions of climatic variables are proposed, based on field measurements, laboratory ex-periments and theory.
