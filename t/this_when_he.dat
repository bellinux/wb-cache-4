5|$|The Freedmen's Bureau agent {{wrote to}} Congressman William Kelley of Pennsylvania {{requesting}} {{the removal of}} Johnston's disabilities because of his charity.

5|$|In {{that same}} year, Edmund Grey, {{the son of}} a Marick family maid and gardener, returns to town to see his {{childhood}} friend, Angelique. Dimitri is furious to see Edmund again since he had stolen money from Dimitri's father to pay for his education. Dimitri is stunned when Edmund informs him that they are half-brothers. Edmund had discovered <b>this</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> found a will of Hugo Marick that states he is not only his illegitimate son, but that he is the lawful heir to Wildwind. Helga had planted the will because she believed Dimitri was going to leave Angelique for Erica. When Dimitri assures Helga he will stay with Angelique, she destroys the will {{in order to keep the}} estate for her daughter. Edmund accuses Dimitri of stealing the will and files a lawsuit to have Hugo's body exhumed in order to perform a DNA test. Dimitri believes Edmund is lying about everything and is infuriated by the lawsuit. The hatred between the two deepens even more. Eventually, the truth about what Helga did is revealed and she dies. Dimitri and Edmund agree to put the past behind them and they bond as brothers. They develop an extremely close and loving relationship, but they also continue to have a standing rivalry.|$|E

5|$|Outside of hockey, Gardiner enjoyed several {{different}} hobbies. During one off-season from the Black Hawks, Gardiner began taking flying lessons from his former teammate Konrad Johannesson. He quickly {{learned how to}} fly solo and would buy shares in the Winnipeg Flying Club, which Johannesson had founded. He also enjoyed shooting rifles; {{in the summer of}} 1931 he was recognised for <b>this</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was elected Field Secretary of the Winnipeg Gun Club. The following summer Gardiner earned a certificate in business administration and sales from the International Correspondence Schools. He then became a partner in a sporting goods business and travelled across Western Canada in the summer to sell products to sports teams. Gardiner attended church services at Grace United Church in Winnipeg, which had hosted his wedding. He was also a Freemason, and joined the St. John's Lodge in Winnipeg on April 21, 1926. During the summer of 1933, he was selected as a Shriner at the Lodge; at the age of 29 he was the youngest Shriner in the city.|$|E
5|$|Whether Ragnall or Rǫgnvaldr, William's act {{of using}} a {{grandson}} of Óláfr in Caithness {{may have been an}} example of the king playing one member of the jarlsaetten against another. The jarlsaetten were people who possessed a claim to an earldom, in accordance with Norse custom, by right of their descent from previous earls. There are earlier instances of such claimants requesting Scottish kings for what they considered their birthright, and William certainly did <b>this</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> granted Caithness to Haraldr Eiríksson, a grandson of Rǫgnvaldr Kali Kolsson, Earl of Orkney. If Ragnall was indeed a descendant of Ingibjǫrg, a daughter of Páll Hákonarson, Earl of Orkney (died 1137), he was directly descended from previous Scandinavian earls. Whereas Óláfr's marriage to Ingibjǫrg may have meant that Rǫgnvaldr was regarded {{as a member of the}} jarlsaetten as well, and a cousin to Haraldr himself.|$|E
5|$|While {{he was in}} Paris at the Jardin des Plantes, Gray saw {{an unnamed}} dried specimen, {{collected}} by André Michaux, and named it Shortia galacifolia. He spent considerable time and effort over the next 38 years looking for a specimen in the wild. The first such expedition was in late June to late July 1841 to an area near Jefferson, Ashe County, North Carolina. His further expeditions searching for this species were also unsuccessful, including one in 1876. In May 1877 a North Carolina herb collector found a specimen but {{did not know what}} it was. Eighteen months later the collector sent it to Joseph Whipple Congdon, who contacted Gray, telling Gray that he felt he had found Shortia. Gray was ecstatic to confirm <b>this</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> saw the specimen in October 1878. In spring 1879 Gray led an expedition, in which the collector helped, to the spot where S.galacifolia had been found. Gray never saw the species in the wild in bloom, but made a final trip to this region in 1884.|$|E

25|$|In February 2010, an Arab country's unnamed {{ambassador}} to Dubai had his marriage annulled after discovering that his bride was cross-eyed and had facial hair. The woman had worn a niqab on the occasions {{that the couple}} had met prior to the wedding. The ambassador informed the Sharia court {{that he had been}} deliberately deceived by the bride's mother, who had shown him photographs of the bride's sister. He only discovered <b>this</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> lifted the niqab to kiss his bride. The court annulled the marriage, but refused a claim for compensation.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} evil is often phrased in the form: Why {{do bad things}} happen to good people?. Christianity teach that all people are {{inherently}} sinful due to the fall of man and original sin; for example, Calvinist theology follows a doctrine called federal headship, which argues that the first man, Adam, was the legal representative of the entire human race. A counterargument to the basic version of this principle is that an omniscient God would have predicted <b>this,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> created the world, and an omnipotent God could have prevented it.|$|E

The week after that, Kaymer finished T-34 at the Open Championship, which was his best finish in a major to that time. He bettered <b>this</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> moved through the final round field to finish in a tie for sixth at the PGA Championship.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 3-4 March 2002, Reddy escaped from police custody again, while being {{transferred}} from Bellary to Bangalore in a KSRTC bus. The District Armed Reserve (DAR) personnel of Bellary, who accompanied him, claimed that he was handcuffed at the time, but Reddy denied <b>this</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was arrested two months later. He stated that he bought rum and chicken for the policemen, and earned their trust. When the bus stopped at a dhaba near Hiriyur bypass, he requested the policemen to remove his handcuffs on the pretext {{that he needed to}} answer the call of nature. Once free, he ran into the fields and escaped.|$|E
25|$|Kuvempu {{was more}} than a writer for his life was in itself a 'great message'. He was against casteism, {{meaningless}} practices and religious ritual. Kuvempu's writings reflect his resentment against these practices. The Shoodra Tapaswi ("untouchable saint") was one such writing. Kuvempu who was from the Vokkaliga community gave a perspective to the ancient epic Ramayana that was quite unlike the portrayal of the characters by the original author Valmiki. Kuvempu's version of the epic called Sri Ramayana Darshanam won him the prestigious Jnanpith Award. His epic underscores his vision of Sarvodaya ("upliftment of all"). The protogonist of his epic, the Hindu god Rama, personifies <b>this</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> tests himself along with his consort Sita by jumping into the fire.|$|E

Poirot realised <b>this</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had the man followed back to the lodge. Andersen's chemistry background (although he was probably not a Jewish refugee) came in useful for preparing injections of hashish to produce ecstasy in his adherents, and also for injecting them with relevant bacteria {{when he wanted to}} kill them and inherit their estates. Andersen was about to inject Miss Carnaby with tuberculosis bacteria to tie in with the fictional ailment she told him about. The proof has been obtained in the laboratory in the sanctuary that the police have raided.|$|E
25|$|Initially educated to be a minister, Rogers was displeased {{with the}} way {{television}} addressed children and {{made an effort to}} change <b>this</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> began to write for and perform on local Pittsburgh-area shows dedicated to youth. WQED developed his own show in 1968 and it was distributed nationwide by Eastern Educational Television Network. Over the course of three decades on television, Fred Rogers became an icon of American children's entertainment and education. He was also known for his advocacy of various public causes. His testimony before a lower court in favor of fair-use recording of television shows to play at another time (now known as time shifting) was cited in a U.S. Supreme Court decision on the Betamax case, and he gave now-famous testimony to a U.S. Senate committee, advocating government funding for children's television.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber {{first began}} {{plans for a}} sequel to his 1986 hit musical, The Phantom of the Opera, in 1990. Following a {{conversation}} with Maria Björnson, the designer of The Phantom of the Opera, Lloyd Webber decided that, were a sequel to come about, it would be set in New York City {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. One of his ideas was to have the Phantom live above ground in Manhattan's first penthouse, but he rejected <b>this</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> saw a TV documentary about the Coney Island fairground. Lloyd Webber began collaborating with author Frederick Forsyth on the project, but it soon fell apart as Lloyd Webber felt the ideas they were developing would be difficult to adapt for a stage musical. Forsyth went on to publish some of the ideas he had worked on with Lloyd Webber in 1999 as a novel entitled The Phantom of Manhattan.|$|E
