40|$|We {{study the}} {{economics}} of employment relationships in large law firms. Our point of departure is the “property-rights” approach that emphasizes the centrality of ownership’s legal rights to control significant nonhuman assets of the enterprise. From this perspective, law firms are an interesting object of study because <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>asset</b> in these firms is knowledge, particularly knowledge of the needs and interests of clients. We argue that two distinctive organizational features of law firms—the use of “up-or-out” promotion contests {{and the practice of}} having winners become residual claimants in the firm—emerge naturally in this setting. ...|$|R
