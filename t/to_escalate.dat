5|$|After the {{violence}} of November 4, the Indianapolis Merchant's Association and other business leaders petitioned Governor Ralston to call out the Indiana National Guard. Members of both parties accused the union leaders of trying to prevent their voters from reaching the polls. The riots made national news and public leaders began to consider them an embarrassment to the state. Union leaders informed the Governor that calling out the guard would only cause them <b>to</b> <b>escalate</b> the riot and lead to more bloodshed.|$|E

In November, the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (HV). The development of the military of Croatia was hampered by a UN arms embargo introduced in September, while the military conflict in Croatia continued <b>to</b> <b>escalate</b> with the Battle of Vukovar, which started on 26 August.|$|E
5|$|Author Timothy White {{has called}} Paramount's efforts to launch its own {{television}} service, which directly competed with the DuMont Television Network, an unwise decision – Paramount in effect was competing with itself. The resulting ill feelings between Paramount's and DuMont's executives continued <b>to</b> <b>escalate</b> throughout the early 1950s, {{and the lack}} of cooperation hindered both entities' network plans. According to White, by 1953, even the public pretense of cooperation between Paramount and DuMont was gone.|$|E

5|$|Female-female {{aggression}}, {{which is}} fairly rare in other marine vertebrates, is common among loggerheads. Ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. Escalation typically follows four steps. First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, sparring occurs with turtles snapping at each other’s jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions, or involves chasing {{one out of}} the immediate vicinity. Escalation is determined by several factors, including hormone levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance of location. At all stages, an upright tail shows willingness <b>to</b> <b>escalate,</b> while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact is much more likely <b>to</b> <b>escalate</b> when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds. Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly territorial, and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species.|$|E

5|$|By June 1991, Banovina {{declared}} {{itself a}} part of the Serbian Autonomous Oblast Krajina (SAO Krajina), and the Serb–Croat conflict began <b>to</b> <b>escalate.</b> Clashes peaked in late July, when Croatian Serb forces launched an offensive codenamed Operation Stinger. It was primarily aimed at the Croat-populated villages between Dvor and Hrvatska Kostajnica, and the police station in the town of Glina. The offensive was successful in securing Glina, and prompted the withdrawal of Croat forces from the Una River valley south and west of Hrvatska Kostajnica on 27 July.

5|$|Following the Plitvice Lakes {{incident}} of 1 April 1991, SAO Krajina forces captured three Croatian policemen from nearby Drniš, {{with the intention}} of exchanging them for Croatian Serb troops taken prisoner by the Croatian forces at the Plitvice Lakes. In turn, the militia established by the residents of Kijevo captured several Serb civilians and demanded that the captured policemen be released in exchange for their prisoners. On 2 April, JNA intelligence officers reported on this, and warned how local militias in Kijevo and Civljane, otherwise separated by barricades, were engaged in armed skirmishes that threatened <b>to</b> <b>escalate.</b> Kijevo became strategically significant because its location hindered SAO Krajina road communications.|$|E
5|$|In 1738, the Synod {{moved to}} {{restrict}} itinerant preaching and to tighten educational requirements for ministers, actions the New Side resented.

However, many began to resist. Eaton warned Jackson against an excessive show of military force, fearing that this would only provoke the Seminole further. Jackson heeded his advice at first, but continuing to do so proved impossible, as Seminole attacks continued. The violence {{eventually led to the}} Second Seminole War. In 1836, Eaton was replaced as governor by Richard K. Call. Eaton was then appointed Ambassador to Spain, serving until 1840. His tenure was undistinguished.|$|E

In Spring 1946 {{it was announced that}} Liberty would be getting a fifth partner, producer-director Victor Fleming, although that deal never saw fruition. The film was released in November 1946, but was a financial failure. Although it was in the top 7% of that year's films as ranked by box office gross, it was unable to recoup its high production cost of $2.3 million, much less show a profit. After the film's release, Briskin became an outspoken advocate for the policy of longer runs for films, allowing them to recoup the cost of production. Without longer runs, he told The Film Daily, the quality of films would decline, as production costs continued <b>to</b> <b>escalate.</b>|$|E
5|$|General Nguyễn Khánh {{had come}} to power in January 1964 after {{surprising}} the ruling junta of General Dương Văn Minh in a bloodless coup. However, due to American pressure, he kept the popular Minh as a token head of state, while concentrating real power in his hands by controlling the Military Revolutionary Council. In August, the Vietnam War continued <b>to</b> <b>escalate</b> following the Gulf of Tonkin incident, a disputed encounter between communist and American naval vessels off the North Vietnamese coast; Washington accused North Vietnam of attacking their ships in international waters. Khánh saw the tense situation {{as an opportunity to}} increase his authority. On August 7, he declared a state of emergency, increased police powers, banned protests, tightened censorship and allowed the police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers. He drafted a new constitution, which would have augmented his personal power {{at the expense of the}} already-limited Minh. However, these moves only served to weaken Khánh as large demonstrations and riots broke out in the cities, with majority Buddhists prominent, calling for an end to the state of emergency and the abandonment of the new constitution, as well as a progression back to civilian rule.|$|E
5|$|In 1785 Clark {{helped to}} {{negotiate}} the Treaty of Fort McIntosh and the Treaty of Fort Finney in 1786, but the violence between Native Americans and European-American settlers continued <b>to</b> <b>escalate.</b> According to a 1790 U.S. government report, 1,500Kentucky settlers {{had been killed in}} Indian raids {{since the end of the}} Revolutionary War. In an attempt to end the raids, Clark led an expedition of 1,200drafted men against Native American villages along the Wabash River in 1786. The campaign, one of the first actions of the Northwest Indian War, ended without a victory. After approximately three hundred militiamen mutinied due to a lack of supplies, Clark had to withdraw, but not before concluding a ceasefire with the native tribes. It was rumored, most notably by James Wilkinson, that Clark had often been drunk on duty. When Clark learned of the accusations, he demanded an official inquiry, but the Virginia governor declined his request and Virginia Council condemned Clark's actions. With Clark's reputation tarnished, he never again led men in battle. Clark left Kentucky and moved across the Ohio River to the Indiana frontier, near present-day Clarksville, Indiana.|$|E
