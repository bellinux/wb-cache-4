5|$|Historians Félix Luna, Miguel Angel de Marco and Fernando Rocchi all {{praise the}} role of Raúl Alfonsín in the {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War and the restoration of democracy. Luna also considers that Alfonsín was an effective president, and that he set an example of not using the state for personal gain. De Marco points out that it was a delicate time period, and any mistake could have endangered the newly founded democracy and led to another coup. The aforementioned historians do not agree, though, on their view of the Pact of Olivos. Luna considers that it was a necessary evil to prevent the chaos that would have been generated if Menem managed to proceed with the constitutional amendment without negotiating with the UCR. De Marco and Rocchi instead believe that it was <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>mistake</b> of Alfonsín's political career.|$|E

500|$|Development of Super Meat Boy {{began in}} January 2009. Initially {{announced}} for WiiWare and PC, {{the game was}} set {{to be released in}} the first quarter of 2010. The release date was pushed back to the fourth quarter because the developers wanted more time to create extra levels, such as the dark worlds. A picture released on Team Meat's Twitter page on February 22, 2010, revealed that the game would also be released for XBLA. The next day, they announced that, while all versions would be released in the same month, the game would be released for XBLA first due to [...] "contractual obligations". In August 2010, the developers were contacted by Microsoft with the prospect of inclusion in Microsoft's 2010 Fall GameFeast XBLA promotion two months later. As they were almost out of money, they did not believe that they could financially support themselves until the Spring event, but felt they had four months' worth of work left to complete on the game. For the final two months of development they worked daily, slept five hours a night, and frequently forgot to eat—a process that McMillen said he [...] "would never voluntarily go through" [...] again. According to McMillen, due to Microsoft's low expectations for the game, Super Meat Boy was lightly promoted. The level of promotion was not increased during the GameFeast, though the game greatly outsold the rest of the games in the event. The team described the effort required to finish the game for the promotion as [...] "by far <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>mistake</b> [...] made during SMB's development". Their development struggle is depicted in the documentary [...] The game was released on XBLA in October 2010 and on PCs via Steam and Direct2Drive a month later. McMillen noted that the PC release was more heavily promoted than the XBLA version. A version for Mac OS X was released in November 2011, while another version for Linux operating systems was released in December 2011 as part of the Humble Indie Bundle #4 game pack.|$|E

We don't have time to teach and train youngsters up here. Our job is to win pennants, not run schools", he said. Franklin Lewis, sports writer and author, wrote [...] "Lajoie, in spite of his {{marvelous}} fielding and tremendous batting, was not exactly a darling of the grandstand as a manager." [...] Lajoie recommended to Somers on August 17, 1909, he find the team a new manager, although he wanted to remain on the club as a player. Somers responded to Lajoie by giving him more time to finalize his decision but when Lajoie came back days later and announced the same decision, Somers acted quickly to find a replacement. Lajoie later described the decision to take on the added duties as a player-manager as <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>mistake</b> of his career as he felt it negatively affected his play. The highest-paid player in the league, he also offered a $10,000 ($ in current dollar terms) reduction in salary. Somers promoted Naps coach Deacon [...] "Jim" [...] McGuire to manager. The team finished 7182 while Lajoie's [...]324 average was third in the AL and 33 doubles second. The Naps finished 1910 7181 but Lajoie had one of his better seasons statistically as he led the majors with a [...]384 average and 227 hits, both categories bettered only in Lajoie's 1901 campaign. His 51 doubles, a career-high, and 304 total bases led the majors, the fourth and final time in his career he would lead the majors in the latter category. Lajoie missed significant parts of back-to-back seasons, the first in 1911 when he appeared in just 90 games. Stovall, the former Naps first baseman, replaced McGuire as the club's manager and the Naps finished 8073. Lajoie was forced to sit out six weeks of the 1912 season when he sprained his back in May during a practice session in Chicago. He played in 117 games on the season, an increase of the 90 he played in one season before, but Cleveland, who had hired Joe Birmingham as the team's fifth manager since Lajoie gave up the role in 1909, finished 7578. Lajoie and Joe Jackson tied for the team lead with 90 RBIs. He finished fourth in the AL with a [...]368 batting average. In 1913, Birmingham and Lajoie had arguments in the open, including one incident in June when Lajoie cursed Birmingham openly to reporters after being benched during a batting slump. Lajoie hit [...]335 on the year, the last time he would hit over [...]300 in his career.|$|E
