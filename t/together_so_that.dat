Admitting that he killed Sam's girlfriend Jessica because he believed she was holding him back from returning to his old life of hunting supernatural creatures, the demon then shows him the night of his mother's death. Azazel had come into Sam's nursery and fed him his blood, with Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) walking in and recognizing the demon.|$|E
5|$|Musically, {{the album}} is {{structured}} like a DJ's set. The songs are sequenced and blended <b>together</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> they are played continuously without any gaps. The title arrived {{from the fact that}} the album track listing consists of light-hearted and happy songs in the beginning, and progresses to much darker melodies and lyrics describing personal feelings and commitments. Songs on the album sample and reference the music of other dance-oriented artists like ABBA, Donna Summer, Pet Shop Boys, the Bee Gees and Depeche Mode, as well as Madonna's 1980s output.|$|E

5|$|Along with {{purchasing}} specimens, many geologists {{visited her}} to collect fossils or discuss anatomy and classification. Henry De la Beche and Anning became friends as teenagers following his move to Lyme, and he, Mary, and sometimes Mary's brother Joseph, went fossil-hunting together. De la Beche and Anning {{kept in touch}} as {{he became one of}} Britain's leading geologists. William Buckland, who lectured on geology at the University of Oxford, often visited Lyme on his Christmas vacations and was frequently seen hunting for fossils with Anning. It was to him she made what would prove to be the scientifically important suggestion that the strange conical objects known as bezoar stones, were really the fossilised faeces of ichthyosaurs or plesiosaurs. Buckland would name the objects coprolites. In 1839 Buckland, Conybeare, and Richard Owen visited Lyme <b>together</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> Anning could lead them all on a fossil-collecting excursion.|$|E

When she sees Becca reading adoption literature {{and that she}} is upset with the baby's father, Liz realizes this may be her chance to adopt a baby. Liz creates a job for Becca as the TGS with Tracy Jordan youth consultant. Liz believes that encouraging Becca to follow her dream as a singer will lead her {{to give up her}} baby to Liz. However, when Becca's boyfriend, Tim (Christopher Nicholas Smith), comes to the 30 Rock building, Liz realizes that Becca and Tim should be <b>together</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> they can raise their child together, and tells them to make their relationship work.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoulder}} of Acrocanthosaurus was {{limited in its}} range of motion {{compared to that of}} humans. The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backwards) 109° from the vertical, so that the humerus could actually be angled slightly upwards. Protraction (swinging forward) was limited to only 24° past the vertical. The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (swinging downwards), but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above horizontal. Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm. The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked <b>together</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> there was no possibility of pronation or supination (twisting) as in human forearms.|$|E

5|$|There {{are male}} (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers (unisexual flowers) {{on a single}} plant (monoecious), and these grow singly, {{appearing}} from the leaf axils. Flowers have five fused yellow to orange petals (the corolla) and a green bell-shaped calyx. Male flowers in Cucurbitaceae generally have five stamens, but in Cucurbita there are only three, and their anthers are joined <b>together</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> {{there appears to be}} one. Female flowers have thick pedicels, and an inferior ovary with 3–5 stigmas that each have two lobes. The female flowers of C.argyrosperma and C.ficifolia have larger corollas than the male flowers. Female flowers of C.pepo have a small calyx, but the calyx of C.moschata male flowers is comparatively short.|$|E
5|$|After Floyd's wedding, Liz goes to {{the office}} of her fiancé, Wesley Snipes (Michael Sheen), to {{retrieve}} his shoes for Cerie Xerox's (Katrina Bowden) wedding. At Wesley's office, she meets an airline pilot named Carol (Matt Damon). When she learns that Carol is a big fan of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS), for which Liz is the head writer, she asks Carol to go with her to Cerie's wedding, which he accepts. At Cerie's wedding, Wesley is distraught that Liz ended their engagement through a text message she sent to him. Liz tells him that fate brought them <b>together</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> she would meet Carol, with whom she can see herself spending the rest of her life. Wesley is devastated and leaves. Unbeknownst to Liz, Carol, who Liz thought had stepped out from the party area, heard everything she told Wesley, which shocks Carol, prompting him to leave. At the same time, at Cerie's wedding, Nancy learns that Avery is pregnant after having a conversation with her in the ladies room, and tells Jack before she leaves him. When Jack finds Avery, he tells her he wants to marry her, which she accepts.|$|E
25|$|The {{expression}} compatible displacements {{means that}} the particles remain in contact and displace <b>together</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the work done by pairs of action/reaction inter-particle forces cancel out. Various forms of this principle have been credited to Johann (Jean) Bernoulli (1667–1748) and Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782).|$|E

25|$|The ambush was {{initiated}} {{by a small}} element striking {{the head of an}} enemy column and stopping it by fire. Then the main body would attack the column from the rear and/or flank, fragmenting it and rolling it up. The two strikes were timed close enough <b>together</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the target column was engaged from both ends before it could deploy and face toward either danger.|$|E
25|$|To {{construct}} the Klein Bottle, glue the red arrows {{of the square}} together (left and right sides), resulting in a cylinder. To glue {{the ends of the}} cylinder <b>together</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the arrows on the circles match, you must pass one end through the side of the cylinder. Note that this creates a circle of self-intersection - this is an immersion of the Klein bottle in three dimensions.|$|E
25|$|The {{affected}} leg {{usually has}} one foot {{that is in}} an approximately normal position. The extra foot is composed of at least some metatarsal or tarsal bones and extra digits, though it is usually not complete. The feet can be joined <b>together,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the limb appears to have one large foot, or the extra foot can be joined to the limb separately, usually above {{the level of the}} other foot. Diplopodia affects {{one or both of the}} hind limbs.|$|E

25|$|Bundle : In {{this pattern}} the planets are grouped <b>together</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> {{they form a}} 'bundle' within the space of 120 degrees, or the {{equivalent}} of four signs of the zodiac. This intense concentration of planets produces {{a person who is}} equally intense and unrelenting in pursuit of personal interests. Perspective and understanding of others is limited, and it is difficult for this person to share their lives with anyone. The best course of life for such a person is to enter into enterprises that require deep concentration, persistence and commitment, or to specialise in one area of expertise.|$|E
25|$|Knot {{theory is}} the study of {{mathematical}} knots. While inspired by knots that appear in daily life in shoelaces and rope, a mathematician's knot differs in that the ends are joined <b>together</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it cannot be undone. In precise mathematical language, a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, R3. Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of R3 upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself.|$|E

25|$|A {{workflow}} is {{a series}} of processing steps connected <b>together</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the output of one step is used as the input of another. Processing steps implement data analysis tasks such as data importing, statistical tests and report generation. In Anduril, processing steps are implemented using components, which are reusable executable code that can be written in any programming language. Components are wired together into a workflow, or a component network, that is executed by the Anduril workflow engine. Workflow configuration is done using a simple yet powerful scripting language, AndurilScript. Workflow configuration and execution can be done from Eclipse, a popular multipurpose GUI, or from the command line.|$|E
25|$|Roman hypocaust {{heating systems}} made {{extensive}} use of fired clay elements: The space beneath {{the floor of a}} room to be heated was supported on robust pillars (pilae), usually made of small, square bricks mortared <b>together,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the heat from the adjacent furnace could circulate freely. In public and private bath-houses (essential to the Roman way of life), heat was also carried up through the walls in flues made of interlocking box-tiles. Though these were covered up by wall facings both inside and out, they were sometimes manufactured with quite elaborate geometric and even figural decoration. Pipes for water and drainage were also often made of fired clay.|$|E
25|$|Frequently, {{building}} additions {{will not}} be strongly connected to the existing structure, but simply placed adjacent to it, with only minor continuity in flooring, siding, and roofing. As a result, the addition may have a different resonant period than the original structure, and they may easily detach from one another. The relative motion will then cause the two parts to collide, causing severe structural damage. Seismic modification will either tie the two building components rigidly <b>together</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> they behave as a single mass or it will employ dampers to expend the energy from relative motion, with appropriate allowance for this motion, such as increased spacing and sliding bridges between sections.|$|E
