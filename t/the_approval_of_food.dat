40|$|Resumen del póster presentado en el EuroFoodChem XVII celebrado en Istambul (Turkey) del 7 al 10 de mayo de 2013. Acrylamide and {{hydroxymethylfurfural}} (HMF) {{are both}} potential human carcinogens {{that occur in}} food {{as a result of}} cooking or heat processing. Both compounds are considered as important food contaminants within the last several years, and research is ongoing in the areas of toxicology, exposure, formation, and mitigation. The formation of acrylamide and HMF is part of the Maillard reaction, which leads to browning and flavor changes in cooked foods. The proposedtechniques to mitigate acrylamide are as follows: reducing the availability of free asparagine or reducing sugars, modifying other ingredients, and changing cooking time or temperature. Different techniques appear to be useful for different types of products. For cereal products, modifying the time or temperature of cooking, avoiding use of ammonium bicarbonate, and using materials low in asparagine may be more relevant. Most of them are also useful for reducing HMF formation because both chemicals are formed by the same chemical event. Importantly, most proposed measures for reducing acrylamide are still commercially unproven. For <b>the</b> <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> processing contaminants’ mitigating techniques is necessary to know whether these measures affect the taste, stability and safety of a product. The present researcher aimed to mitigate acrylamide and HMF formation by reducing or substituting the added sugar using maltitol or stevioside. The effect of the formulation on sensory properties of cookies was also investigated. Four biscuit formulations were prepared based on wheat flour and using as sugar sucrose, mixed sucrose and stevia, maltitol or stevia. HMF determination was based on the method of Rufián-Henares et al., 2006 while acrylamide was determined by HPLC-MS according to Arribas-Lorenzo and Morales (2009). Color measurements were performed on the ground and homogenized samples using a Hunter Lab D 25 - 9 optical sensor (Hunter Associated Laboratory, Reston, Virginia, USA) according to the CIE Lab scale. A sensorial panel tested the acceptance of the newly formulated foods. Replacing reducing saccharides by saccharide alcohols such as maltitol and stevia significantly reduce the formation of food processing contaminants during baking. Substituting sugars altered some of the cookie quality attributes such as color development however it was not reflected on acceptance for the panelists.

50|$|The Delaney clause, {{initially}} {{enacted in}} 1958, prohibits the FDA from approving food additives shown to cause cancer. At {{the time of}} the passage of the amendment, little was known about the carcinogenic propensities {{of a wide variety of}} additives. Following the enactment of this amendment, more and more substances were shown to be potentially carcinogenic, albeit in experiments wherein test animals were subjected to doses far in excess to the proportions which humans were likely to consume. In 1982, the FDA responded to this trend by adopting a rule that a food additive would not be denied <b>approval</b> under <b>the</b> Delaney clause unless the additive itself, and not just the constituent chemicals used to make it, was shown to cause cancer. This policy was later challenged in court following FDA <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> a <b>food</b> coloring manufactured with a compound known to be carcinogenic, after separate testing indicated that the food coloring itself did not cause cancer in test animals. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld <b>the</b> FDA's <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> coloring.|$|R

Europium doping was performed to enable photoluminescence (PL) function of ACP porous nanospheres. In vitro cytotoxicity experiments showed that the as-prepared porous nanospheres were biocompatible. In vitro drug loading and release experiments indicated that ibuprofen-loaded europium-doped ACP (Eu 3 +:ACP) porous nanospheres had a slow and sustained drug release profile in simulated body fluid (SBF). The cumulative amount of the released drug had a linear relationship with the natural logarithm of release time (ln(t)). The Eu 3 +:ACP porous nanospheres were bioactive, and could transform to HAp after drug release.|$|R
40|$|A brief {{overview}} is provided {{of some of}} the general safety and risk assessment procedures used by the different centers of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (U. S. FDA) to evaluate low-level exposures. The U. S. FDA protects public health by regulating a wide variety of consumer products including foods, human and animal drugs, biologics, and medical devices under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The diverse legal and regulatory standards in the act allow for the consideration of benefits for some products (e. g., drugs) but preclude them from others (e. g., food additives). When not precluded by statutory mandates (e. g., Delaney prohibition), the U. S. FDA considers both physiologic adaptive responses and beneficial effects. For the basic safety assessment paradigm as presently used, for example in <b>the</b> premarket <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> additives, <b>the</b> emphasis is on the identification of adverse effects and no observed adverse effect level(s) (NOAEL). Generally, the NOAEL is divided by safety factors to establish an acceptable exposure level. This safety assessment paradigm does not preclude the consideration of effects whether they are biologically adaptive or beneficial at lower dose levels. The flexibility to consider issues such as mechanisms of action and adaptive and beneficial responses depends on the product under consideration. For carcinogenic contaminants and radiation from medical devices, the U. S. FDA considers the potential cancer risk at low exposure levels. This generally involves downward extrapolation from the observed dose-response range. The consideration of adverse effects of other toxicologic end points (e. g., reproductive, immunologic, neurologic, developmental) associated with low exposure levels is also becoming more of a reality (e. g., endocrine disrupters). The evaluation of the biologic effects of low-level exposures to toxic substances must include whether the effect is adverse or a normal physiologic adaptive response and also determine the resiliency of a physiologic system. The public health mandate of the U. S. FDA includes an active research program at the National Center for Toxicological Research and the other U. S. FDA centers to support the regulatory mission of the U. S. FDA. This includes the development of knowledge bases, predictive strategies, and toxicologic studies to investigate effects {{at the lower end of}} the dose-response range. Because of the wide diversity of legal and regulatory standards for various products regulated by the U. S. FDA agency-wide safety and risk assessment procedures and policies generally do not exist...|$|R

Different {{types of}} starches {{are very important}} in food applications, not only as an energy rich carbonhydrate {{but also as a}} food additive used to regulate a foodstuffs texture and viscosity. Modified starches can be manufactured by different types of chemical, enzymatic and physical modifications. This thesis aims to give an overview of the chemical modifications that are used for food applications today. The thesis also gives a short overview of common enzymatic and physical modifications. Modifications of starch are usually performed to alter gelling temperature and viscosity of starches or to increase its resistance to shear, low pH, high temperature and retrograding. Chemical modification is performed either by substitution of free hydroxyl-groups in the glucose units or by degradation of the starch chain. The most common chemical substitutions that is used for food applications today is a combination of cross-links with multi functional substituents and stabilizing modifications such as acetylating or hydroxypropylation. Another common modification of starch is lipophilic substitution which produces an amphiphilic starch that can be used as an emulsifier. The chemical modifications which are approved for use in food applications today where developed {{during the middle of the}} 20 th century and today there is virtually no development of new chemical modifications intended for use in food production. This is partly due to the high costs associated with <b>the</b> <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> new <b>food</b> additives but also a greater focus on the development of new enzymatic and physical modifications...|$|R
