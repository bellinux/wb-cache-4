One army officer died via electrocution while trying to fix {{the roof of his}} dwelling in Makati.

Twenty-six of the casualties happened in Manila while 12others died in the rural town of Daet along the southern part of Luzon due to flooding and falling debris. Due to the storm, iron sheets were littered across <b>the</b> <b>slums</b> <b>of</b> Manila. Communication lines between Daet and Manila were disconnected; many villages between the two location were destroyed. In Lucena, two people were killed and many coconuts were tossed from trees. In Bulacan, civil defense officials advised thousands of inhabitants {{on the banks of the}} Angat River to flee as water along the river threatened to overflow their banks. In the Rizal province, one agency reported that it dispatched several army trucks to fetch roughly 2,000stranded 12- to 15-year-old boy scouts.

Edge tells her that she is an Errorist with the gift of both stealing and remixing memories. After escaping into <b>the</b> <b>slums</b> <b>of</b> Neo-Paris, Nilin encounters Tommy, a fellow Errorist. Nilin and Tommy are attacked by Olga Sedova, a bounty hunter chasing Nilin. Nilin dives into Olga's mind and remixes her memory to make Olga believe that her husband was killed by a Memorize doctor. She then becomes an Errorist ally, and transports Nilin to her first destination. Arriving in the Saint-Michel district, Nilin, who is aided by another Errorist codenamed Bad Request, is told by Edge to steal secret codes from Kaori Sheridan, Neo-Paris' top architect. After retrieving and uploading the codes to Edge, he uses them to open the Saint-Michel dam, flooding the district. Due to the flood draining out the slums, Nilin is able to infiltrate the Bastille and heads to the memory servers to free the stored memories of herself and the inmates while taking down Madame, the sadistic manager of the Bastille. With Madame defeated, Nilin releases the memories of the inmates and partially regains some of her own. She remembers the crime that landed her in the Bastille; on a mission, Nilin remixed the mind of a Memorize commander and made him believe he had killed his girlfriend.
