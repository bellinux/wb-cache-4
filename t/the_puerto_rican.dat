5|$|British ornithologist David Lack {{considered}} that <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> amazon had {{evolved from the}} Hispaniolan amazon (A. ventralis) found in Hispaniola, but it has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis, including the similarities found between the black-billed amazon (A. agilis) of Jamaica and <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> amazon. Subsequent studies showed that size and color patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that patterns changed with relative ease even within {{members of the same}} species. The research concluded that <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> amazon may share a common ancestor with the Jamaican A. agilis. Recent phylogenetic studies show that <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> amazon is more closely related to the Hispaniolan amazon and the Cuban amazon than to the black-billed amazon.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans,</b> {{who only}} spoke Spanish and no English, worked {{alongside}} immigrants from China, Japan, The Philippines, Korea and Portugal {{and when the}} Japanese heard their music, they said it sounded [...] "scratchy".

They lived near one another and <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> felt disrespected when the Japanese walked around naked or almost naked for their baths. In response, the people of Hawaii said <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> didn't have good bathing habits. Sometimes fights would break out and a <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> may have cut a Japanese with a machete or knife to teach him respect. According to oral tradition- video recordings by Onetake2012 and research done by Ted Solis, an ethnomusicologist, <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> get-togethers often involved fights and the Japanese called it [...] "cut cut".A news article from 1903 said the Japanese were afraid of <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> because they often carried concealed weapons and were quarrelsome.

5|$|Birds {{currently}} {{receive the}} greatest attention {{in regards to}} conservation. Arguably the most successful fauna recovery plan in Puerto Rico was <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Parrot Recovery Plan. Initiated in 1968, its main objective was to downlist <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> parrot's status from critical to threatened by 2020. Other objectives include the establishment of two separate, effective, wild populations (500 or more individuals for 5 years), the protection of habitat for those populations and the control of predators, parasites and competitors of the species. Currently, the total wild parrot population is estimated at 44 individuals, and 105 birds are in captivity. This program was fundamental in raising ecological awareness in Puerto Rico.|$|E

5|$|The 11 snake species {{occurring}} in Puerto Rico are generally considered non-venomous, although research {{has concluded that}} at least one species, <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> racer (Alsophis portoricensis), secretes venom.

The largest snake in Puerto Rico is the endemic Puerto Rican boa (Epicrates inornatus) with a maximum length of 12ft (3.7m). The diet of snakes in Puerto Rico consists of reptiles (Ameiva, Anolis, geckos), coquís and other frogs, and, to a lesser extent, mice, birds and bats (exclusively by <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Boa).|$|E
