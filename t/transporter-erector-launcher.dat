50|$|It {{manufactures}} heavy-duty trucks, buses, trolleybuses, road {{tractors and}} semi-trailers for semi-trailer trucks, and cranes. MAZ was, and possibly is, the world's largest manufacturer of TELs (<b>Transporter-Erector-Launchers)</b> {{for many of}} the world's mobile ballistic missiles, from the widely proliferated MAZ-543 used to carry and launch the Scud B through to the recent Topol M's impressive 8-axle TEL.|$|R
5000|$|Wanshan {{supplied}} WS51200 {{trucks to}} a North Korean company; the trucks appeared, as <b>transporter-erector-launchers,</b> carrying missiles, at a North Korean military parade. It has been claimed that this sale violated non-proliferation agreements; although China {{is not a}} member of MTCR, its own arms-control rules are similar. The North Korean government is investing in <b>transporter-erector-launchers</b> which are a more difficult target for adversaries, compared to fixed missile launch sites. UN and Asean investigators have concluded that the TELs were Chinese WS51200 trucks legitimately exported to North Korea for lumber transport, with the sales contract specifically prohibiting use of the vehicles for military purposes. The North Koreans illegally converted them into TELs by installing hydraulic gear and controls to erect a missile. Despite being converted to fire a missile, the truck would not be likely to survive damage from the rocket exhaust like a purpose-built TEL, making it a single-use launcher, but North Korean solve this problem by using a temporary launchpad on base of missile that make possible to separate TEL form missile during launching & there is no more need for TEL during missile separation [...]|$|R
5000|$|Like the Hwasong-12, the Hwasong-14 {{appears to}} be transported on an {{off-road}} capable Wanshan Special Vehicle WS51200 8 axle transporter erector vehicle. This capability is particularly well-suited for North Korea, which has only around 700 km of paved road throughout the country. The vehicle uses a US-designed Cummins KTTA19 C700 diesel engine. The vehicle was imported from China and declared for civilian use by the North Korean foreign ministry. Mike Turner, chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on strategic forces stated that [...] "the prospect of Chinese support for this program, which ‘would require approval from {{the highest levels of}} China’s government and from the People’s Liberation Army,’ means that China is enabling North Korea to deploy ICBMs that could be tipped with nuclear warheads aimed at the United States. Such cooperation therefore poses a direct threat to the security of the American people." [...] Although {{it is hard to believe}} that the Chinese were not aware that North Korea would use the vehicle chassis for its illicit missile program, available evidence suggests that Pyongyang did indeed add the erectors at facilities known to assemble missile <b>transporter-erector-launchers</b> (TELs).|$|R

50|$|A {{satellite}} {{would be}} installed on a Kuaizhou rocket {{and stored in}} a maintenance facility. Once needed, it can be deployed by a <b>transporter-erector-launcher</b> vehicle to a secure location and can be launched with a preparation time as short as several hours.|$|E
50|$|Its {{accuracy}} {{is sufficient for}} use against military targets such as bases or airfields. It is carried on a road mobile <b>Transporter-Erector-Launcher</b> (TEL) vehicle. The use of solid propellant and the TEL vehicle make the missile easy to store, transport and fire.|$|E

50|$|The Start-1 rocket {{is unique}} amongst launch {{vehicles}} in that its launch platform is mobile, {{allowing for the}} Start-1 to potentially launch from anywhere. The Start-1 launches from an unmodified Topol <b>Transporter-Erector-Launcher</b> (TEL). The TEL is a massive fourteen-wheeled vehicle, six of which pivot for steering. The launch vehicle is transported and launched inside a mobile Transport and Launch Carrier (TLC) carried by the TEL. The TLC consists of an air-tight composite cylinder that protects the launch vehicle and payload from variations in temperature and humidity. The TLC lies {{in the middle of}} the TEL lengthwise and bisects the driver's cab in two.|$|E
5000|$|At 5:28 p.m. EST January 11, 2007, the People's Republic of China {{successfully}} {{destroyed a}} defunct Chinese weather satellite, FY-1C. The destruction was reportedly {{carried out by}} an SC-19 ASAT missile with a kinetic kill warhead similar in concept to the American Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle. FY-1C was a weather satellite orbiting Earth in polar orbit {{at an altitude of}} about 865 km, with a mass of about 750 kg. Launched in 1999, it was the fourth satellite in the Feng Yun series. The missile was launched from a mobile <b>Transporter-Erector-Launcher</b> (TEL) vehicle at Xichang (...) and the warhead destroyed the satellite in a head-on collision at an extremely high relative velocity. Evidence suggests that the same SC-19 system was also tested in 2005, 2006, 2010, and 2013, although none of those events created any long-lived orbital debris.|$|E
40|$|Effective {{military}} use of UVs (Unmanned Vehicles) {{will depend}} on coordination of large teams. Automating an aircraft squadron, for example, would not only require automating the piloting of planes but also leadership functions, support roles, and incidental forms of cooperation such as battle damage assessment (BDA) or escort functions. To illustrate anticipated scales, one scenario proposed by RAND (Vick Moore, Pirnie, and Stillion, 2000) attack TELs (<b>transporter-erector-launcher)</b> ”, using LOCAAS (low cost autonomous attack system), calls {{for the use of}} up to 1, 000 UAVs (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles) in a massed attack. In this chapter we develop three key ideas for making human control of large UV teams possible...|$|E
40|$|In {{cooperation}} with the Operations Research Department at the Naval Postgraduate School, this thesis introduces a computer model for simulating the integration of a lethal unmanned air vehicle (UAV) into a tactical ballistic missile (TBM) counterforce plan. The current capability of autonomous and precise UAV trajectory tracking utilizing an onboard Global Positioning System (GPS) integrated guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) suite lends itself exceptionally to this role. The counterforce concept implies destruction of the TBM <b>transporter-erector-launcher</b> (TEL) within enemy territory. The study of this concept has recently been directed towards emulating well established anti- submarine warfare (ASW) search and destroy methods. The scenario presented in this thesis leaves that premise intact by the implementation of unattended ground sensors (UGS) {{for the purpose of}} detecting, tracking and classifying the TEL vehicle, and cueing the lethal UAV for attack. The end result of this work is a viable simulation for use in various future analyses. The simulation design allows for easy modification and expansion, and will serve as a valuable tool in the exploration of TBM counterforce alternatives. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|E
