5|$|A {{range of}} the fortifications were opened to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post-war years. Deal, Hurst, Pendennis and Portland opened in the 1950s, and Southsea in 1967. Calshot {{followed}} in the 1980s, Camber after {{a long period of}} restoration work in 1994, and Sandsfoot reopened following repair work in 2012. Visitor numbers vary across the sites; Southsea Castle, for example, received over 90,000 visitors in 2011–12. Other forts were put to different uses: Netley was first used a nursing home, and then converted into private flats; Brownsea became a corporate hotel for the employees of the John Lewis Partnership; and Sandgate was restored in the 1970s to form a private home.|$|E
5|$|Aalborghus Castle (Aalborghus Slot) is a half-timbered {{building}} with red-painted woodwork and whitewashed wall panels. It {{was built in}} the mid-16th century by King Christian III for his vassals who collected taxes and is the only remaining example {{of its kind in the}} country. The park, dungeon and casemates, but not the castle itself, are open to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer months. In the 1950s, the castle was converted into administrative offices.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{has since}} been {{replaced}} {{with a number of}} smaller displays available to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reception area showing some traditional Scouting skills, a notable collection of Baden-Powell memorabilia has been on display in the past for visitors in 'The story of B-P' exhibition. This included many drawings and letters by Baden-Powell himself, such as the original of his , Laws for me when I am old and several first editions of his books. The former exhibition also displayed the original painting by David Jagger, as presented to Baden-Powell on 29 August 1929 at the 'Coming of Age' 3rd World Scout Jamboree. This painting, a personal favourite of Baden-Powell, is often used in publications throughout the Scout movement. The Baden-Powell memorabilia has since been moved to the headquarters for Scouting in the UK, Gilwell Park.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{well-established}} writing system for ASL, written sign language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a sign language {{seems to be that}} of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825. However, written sign language remained marginal among <b>the</b> <b>public.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used this system for his 1965 A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles.|$|E
5|$|By 1786, {{the rest}} of the manor except for the {{gatehouse}} had been destroyed; Grose recorded a local tradition stating that Thomas Cecil and Sir Christopher Wandesford had used the stone in the construction of Snape Castle and Kirklington Hall respectively in the late 16th century. In 1976, the tower passed into the guardianship of the state and was then restored and opened to <b>the</b> <b>public.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 21st century it is operated by English Heritage and protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument.|$|E

5|$|Following the eviction, Killakee House {{was briefly}} {{used as an}} {{operations}} base by the Detective Unit of the Garda Síochána in 1931 while they hunted IRA subversives who were hiding explosives at Killakee. When the bank {{was unable to find}} a buyer for the estate, it was acquired by a builder who stripped the house and then demolished it in 1941. The lands were eventually acquired by the State and opened to <b>the</b> <b>public.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> late 1930s, the Director of Forestry, a German called Otto Reinhard, laid out the area as an urban forest. The trees have reclaimed most of the land once occupied by the formal gardens: all that remains is the brickwork {{at the rear of the}} Turner glasshouses and the system of irrigation canals and ponds for the exotic plants contained within.|$|E
5|$|From the 1920s {{through the}} 1970s the {{laboratory}} was used mainly for faculty and graduate research, with two courses offered to undergraduate students in introductory and advanced beekeeping {{as well as}} a single course offered to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summers. There was a brief time in the spring semesters of 2001 and 2002 that an introductory course in beekeeping was offered, however, with the reorganization of the department of entomology these classes have since ceased.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, {{the castle}} was {{transferred}} {{back to the}} Ministry of Works and repaired; the Dartmouth Point Battery, by {{now known as the}} Old Battery, was leased back to the town for use as a restaurant; and the site was reopened to <b>the</b> <b>public.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 21st century it is managed by English Heritage, with the Grand Battery displayed as it would have appeared in the 19th century; it received 37,940 visitors in 2007.

5|$|Part of {{the former}} abbey precinct was donated to Leicester Town Council (the {{predecessor}} of the modern City Council) by the 8th Earl of Dysart. In 1882 it was opened by The Prince of Wales and became known as Abbey Park. The remaining , which included the abbey's site and the ruins of Cavendish House, were donated to the council by the 9th Earl of Dysart in 1925 and, following archaeological excavations, opened to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s. Following its demolition, {{the exact location of}} the abbey was lost; It was only rediscovered during excavations in the 1920s/30s, when the layout was plotted using low stone walls. The abbey has been extensively excavated and was previously used for training archaeology students at the University of Leicester. Leicester Abbey is now protected as a scheduled monument and is Grade I Listed.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Kells {{remained}} in Kells until 1654. In that year, Cromwell's cavalry was quartered {{in the church}} at Kells, and {{the governor of the}} town sent the book to Dublin for safekeeping. Henry Jones, who later became bishop of Meath after the Restoration, presented the manuscript to Trinity College in Dublin in 1661, and it has remained there ever since, except for brief loans to other libraries and museums.

5|$|The first flexifuel {{vehicles}} {{were introduced in}} Spain by late 2007, with the acquisition of 80 cars {{for use in the}} Spaniard official government fleet.

Despite the introduction in the Spaniard market of several flexifuel models, by the end of 2008 still persists the problems of adequate E85 fueling infrastructure, as only 10 gas stations were selling E85 fuel to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entire country.|$|E

5|$|Tiny {{amounts of}} 210Po are {{sometimes}} {{used in the}} laboratory and for teaching purposes—typically {{of the order of}} , in the form of sealed sources, with the polonium deposited on a substrate or in a resin or polymer matrix—are often exempt from licensing by the NRC and similar authorities as they are not considered hazardous. Small amounts of 210Po are manufactured for sale to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States as 'needle sources' for laboratory experimentation, and they are retailed by scientific supply companies. The polonium is a layer of plating which in turn is plated with a material such as gold, which allows the alpha radiation (used in experiments such as cloud chambers) to pass while preventing the polonium from being released and presenting a toxic hazard. According to United Nuclear, they typically sell between four and eight such sources per year.|$|E
