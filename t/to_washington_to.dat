The President-elect subsequently invited Reverend and Mrs. Cole and their family to attend the inauguration; the family was brought to Washington by the Inaugural Committee. Vicki Cole carried a recreation of her sign on the theme float in the inaugural parade.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his public}} nonchalance, Seward was devastated by his {{convention}} loss, as were {{many of his}} supporters. The New Yorker was the best-known and most popular Republican, and his defeat shocked many in the North, who felt that Lincoln had been nominated through chicanery. Although Seward sent a letter stating Weed was not to blame, Seward's political manager took the defeat hard. Seward was initially inclined to retire from public life, but received many letters from supporters: distrustful of Lincoln, they urged Seward to remain involved in politics. On his way <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>to</b> return to Senate duties, he stopped in Albany to confer with Weed, {{who had gone to}} Lincoln's home in Springfield, Illinois to meet with the candidate, and had been very impressed at Lincoln's political understanding. At the Capitol, Seward received sympathy even from sectional foes such as Jefferson Davis.|$|E

5|$|However, in {{the course}} of the speeches {{opposing}} the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory had been attacked and he felt duty bound to defend him. The Democratic Party, knowing his views and that of his state, approached him and asked him to keep silent for the sake of the party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home. He was up for re-election, and the opposing candidates used his position against him.

5|$|In July 1877, {{a violent}} {{railroad}} strike began in Martinsburg, West Virginia, sparking riots in other American cities, such as Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. In response, President Rutherford B. Hayes authorized {{the use of}} the military to put down the rioting. During the crisis, Tilley was temporarily transferred to , sailing up the Potomac River to Washington, D.C. Military leaders feared that rioters from Baltimore could travel <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>to</b> seize or damage vulnerable government targets. The troops defending Washington, including army, navy, and marines, were organized into a battalion of seven companies (Naval Brigade) under the command of Captain Edward Barrett; Tilley was placed in command of Company C. The precautions proved to be unnecessary, as the expected wave of rioters never materialized following the military's suppression of the strikers in Baltimore. Within a short time, the riots in other cities were also quashed.|$|E

Missions were also exchanged with Eisenhower's Allied Force Headquarters in Algiers to coordinate the plans of offensive action in the Mediterranean and north western Europe in 1944. In October and November, Morgan went <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> <b>to</b> discuss the operation with the Combined Chiefs of Staff, accompanied only by Major General Nevil Brownjohn and an aide. Morgan met with General George Marshall, who instructed him to proceed with planning {{on the basis that}} Marshall would be Supreme Allied Commander and Morgan his chief of staff. Morgan met with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House. Roosevelt turned down Morgan's request for the services of Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Jr. to assist with civil affairs, and also cast doubt on whether Marshall could be spared to become Supreme Allied Commander.

5|$|On March 2, 1864, Lincoln {{promoted}} Grant to lieutenant general, {{giving him}} command of all Union Armies, answering {{only to the}} President. Grant assigned Sherman the Division of the Mississippi and traveled <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>to</b> meet with Lincoln to devise a strategy of total war against the Confederacy. Grant established his headquarters with General George Meade's Army of the Potomac in Culpeper, Virginia. Grant developed an overall master plan of five coordinated Union offensives, attacking the rebel armies {{at the same time}} to keep the Confederates from shifting reinforcements within their interior lines. Sherman was to pursue Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Tennessee, while Meade would lead the Army of the Potomac, with Grant in the field, to attack and destroy Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Major General Benjamin Butler was to advance towards Richmond from the south, up the James River, while a joint army-navy operation was to be launched against Mobile, Alabama. If Lee was forced south as expected, Grant would join forces with Butler's armies and be fed supplies from the James. Major General Franz Sigel was to capture the railroad line at Lynchburg, move east, and attack from the Blue Ridge Mountains. Grant knew that Lee had limited manpower and that a war of attrition fought on a battlefield without entrenchments would lead to Lee's defeat.|$|E
5|$|That summer Garfield {{suffered}} from jaundice and significant weight loss. He {{was forced to}} return home, where his wife nursed him back to health. While he was home, Garfield's friends worked to gain him the Republican nomination for Congress, although he refused to politick with the delegates. He returned to military duty that autumn and went <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>to</b> await his next assignment. During this period of idleness, a rumor of an extra-marital affair caused friction in the Garfield marriage until Lucretia eventually chose to overlook it. Garfield repeatedly received tentative assignments that were quickly withdrawn, to his frustration. In the meantime, he served on the court-martial of Fitz John Porter for his tardiness at the Second Battle of Bull Run. He was convinced of Porter's guilt, and voted with his fellow generals to convict. The trial lasted almost two months, from November 1862 to January 1863, {{and by the end}} of it, Garfield had at last procured an assignment as Chief of Staff to Major General William S.

5|$|On May 3, 1808, Taylor {{joined the}} U.S. Army, {{receiving}} a commission {{as a first}} lieutenant of the Seventh Infantry Regiment. He was among the new officers commissioned by Congress {{in response to the}} Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, in which an American frigate had been boarded by the crew of a British warship, sparking calls for war. Taylor spent much of 1809 in the dilapidated camps of New Orleans and nearby Terre aux Boeufs. Under the command of James Wilkinson, the soldiers at Terre aux Boeufs suffered greatly from disease and lack of supplies, and Taylor was given an extended leave, returning to Louisville to recover. Taylor was promoted to captain in November 1810. His army duties were limited at this time, and he attended to his personal finances. Over the next several years, he began to purchase slaves and a good deal of bank stock in Louisville. He bought a plantation in Louisville for $95,000 that had 83 slaves attached to it, as well as the Cypress Grove Plantation near Rodney, Jefferson County, Mississippi, bringing the total number of slaves under him above 200. In July 1811 he was called to the Indiana Territory, where he assumed control of Fort Knox after the commandant fled. In only a few weeks, he was able to restore order in the garrison, for which he was lauded by Governor William Henry Harrison. Taylor was temporarily called <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>to</b> testify for Wilkinson as a witness in a court-martial, and so he did not take part in the November 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe against the forces of Tecumseh, a Shawnee chief.|$|E
