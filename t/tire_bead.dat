2500|$|Balloon tires became {{available}} in 1925. They were [...] all around. Balloon tires were closer in design to today's tires, with steel wires reinforcing the <b>tire</b> <b>bead,</b> making lower pressure possible – typically [...] – giving a softer ride. The old nomenclature for tire size changed from measuring the outer diameter to measuring the rim diameter so [...] (rim diameter) × [...] (tire width) wheels has {{about the same}} outer diameter as 30 in (76cm) clincher tires. All tires in this time period used an inner tube to hold the pressurized air; tubeless tires were not generally in use until much later.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tire</b> <b>bead</b> is {{the term}} for {{the edge of a}} tire that sits on the wheel. Wheels for automobiles, bicycles, etc. are made with a small slot or groove into which the <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> sits. When the tire is {{properly}} inflated the air pressure within the tire keeps the bead in this groove.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{passenger}} vehicles and tubeless tires typically use one-piece rims with a [...] "safety" [...] rim profile. The safety feature {{helps keep the}} <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> held to the rim under adverse conditions by having a pair of safety humps extending inwardly of the rim toward the other <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> seat from an outer contoured surface of the rim.|$|E
50|$|Some {{tires are}} torus-shaped and {{attached}} to tubular rims with adhesive. The rim provides a shallow circular outer cross-section in which the tire lies instead of flanges on which <b>tire</b> <b>beads</b> seat.|$|R

50|$|High {{traction}} {{is desired}} for tires for automobile dirt track racing, off-road racing, off-road vehicles, and off-road motorcycles, so their tread is therefore coarse. Nevertheless, some riders will lower the tire pressure {{to cause the}} tread to spread out and create a larger contact patch. This practice can create a safety hazard, as {{there may not be}} enough pressure to adequately secure the <b>tire</b> <b>beads</b> to the wheel. Reactive ground forces push a tire to one side or the other, especially the outside rear tire of a racing vehicle when it is turning in a corner of a track. This could cause a <b>bead</b> of the <b>tire</b> to come off the rim completely, or enough to cause partial loss of air. It is also possible for the tire to have more traction on the ground than there is friction between the tire and rim. In this case the wheel would slip around the <b>tire</b> <b>beads</b> without turning the tire. Beadlocks, of one form or another including adhesive, are therefore used to keep the <b>beads</b> of off-road <b>tires</b> firmly seated and prevent slip, even when inflation pressure is low.|$|R
5000|$|Invented in 1984 by David Allen Dayton. A {{bead breaker}} {{is a tool}} used for {{separating}} tires from rims. The inner-most diameter of the tire that interfaces with a wheel is called the <b>Tire</b> <b>Bead.</b> The <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> is a thicker section of rubber, and is reinforced with braided steel cable, called the Bead Bundle. [...] The inner-most surface of the <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> creates the air seal between the tire and rim on a radial-ply tire and a bias-ply tire. Often, the bead can become frozen to the rim after rusting or corrosion occurs, requiring {{the use of a}} bead breaker in order to be removed.|$|E
50|$|Tire levers for bicycle tires {{have one}} end that is tapered and {{slightly}} curved. The other end is usually hooked {{so that it}} can be hooked around a spoke to keep the <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> free of the rim at one point, allowing a second lever to be manipulated forward, progressively loosening a larger segment of the <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> from the rim.|$|E

50|$|Kyle Busch {{started from}} the pole {{and led the}} early part of the race. Dale Earnhardt Jr., Carl Edwards, and Kevin Harvick also led {{throughout}} the race, with Harvick leading the most laps. The race saw several drivers have tire issues from melted <b>tire</b> <b>beads</b> including Ryan Newman, Paul Menard, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Brad Keselowski, and Kasey Kahne. Kahne's crash into the wall sent the race into overtime, where Harvick beat Edwards in a photo-finish, followed by Denny Hamlin, Kyle Busch, and Earnhardt, Jr. Harvick won his 8th career race at Phoenix.|$|R

50|$|Michelin {{therefore}} {{decided to}} introduce the world's first tire and roadwheel system, where the two were designed together. This would enable both lower sidewall height, (for better roadholding) whilst retaining comfort due to better stress distribution within the tire, enabled by the redesigned wheel rim and <b>tire</b> <b>bead.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{the tire}} gave good performance, and thus {{as noted above}} gained favour with some OEMs, its {{non-standard}} dimensions proved problematic in the aftermarket. It was also a notoriously hard tire to remove when using basic tools, {{a consequence of the}} deliberately designed strong fit between <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> and rim.|$|E
50|$|Air pressure, via the ply cords, exerts {{tensile force}} on the entire bead {{surrounding}} the wheel rim on which the tire is mounted, pulling outward in a 360 degree pattern. Thus the bead must have high tensile strength. With no force applied to the outer tread, the bead is pulled equally in all directions, thus no additional net {{force is applied to}} the <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> and wheel rim. However, when the tread is pushed inward on one side, this releases some tension in the corresponding sidewall ply pulling on the bead. Yet the sidewall ply on the other side continues to pull the bead in the opposite direction. Thus the still fully tensioned sidewall ply pulls the <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> and wheel rim {{in the same direction as}} the tread displacement with equal force as that applied to push the tread inward.|$|E

5000|$|Air {{pressure}} {{within a}} <b>tire</b> forces its <b>beads</b> against the wheel rim and normally {{ensures that the}} tire and rim rotate as a single unit. In general automotive situations, a tire's air pressure is sufficient to withstand dislodging and rim-slip forces experienced during, respectively, hard cornering and acceleration (including negative acceleration or [...] "braking"). Low tire pressure therefore poses the hazard of enabling sudden loss of air, and loss of control, during hard braking or an evasive maneuver (in addition to generally promoting excessive tire heat and future failure). Modern automotive tires have a soft rubber formulation at the beads to help maintain good rim contact, so special bead-lock means are not required.|$|R
40|$|The Saudi Arabian Standards Organization, SASO, has {{established}} a set of tests that all passenger car tires have to pass {{in order to be}} allowed into the Country. These tests are: visual inspection, dimension measurement, bead unseating, tensile strength and elongation, aging, endurance, and high speed performance tests. This paper describes the application of the first five tests on eight different brands of tires that are taken to represent the categories of “frequently failed” and “infrequently failed” tires in the country. The results showed that the dimensions of almost all the tested tires were somewhat different from those documented in the SASO standards. On the other hand, all the tested <b>tires</b> passed the <b>bead</b> unseating and strength tests. All tires in the “frequently failed” category failed the tensile strength test. In contrast, all tires from the “infrequently failed” category passed this test. The average values of the test for these two tire categories were statistically different at a 95 % confidence level...|$|R
50|$|A {{tubeless}} {{bicycle tire}} system requires a compatible tire, an airtight rim — {{capable of being}} sealed at the valve stem, spoke holes (if they {{go all the way}} through the rim) and the <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> seat. The main benefit of tubeless tires is the ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats because there is no tube to pinch between the rim and an obstacle.|$|E
50|$|Tire levers are not {{necessary}} or desirable in all cases. In some cases, the tire can be reinserted on the rim, and sometimes {{removed from the}} rim, {{without the use of}} tire levers. This reduces the chance of puncture caused by pinching the tube between the rim and the <b>tire</b> <b>bead.</b> Sometimes they are used to fit the tire back on, but this can be done without the levers.|$|E
50|$|Higher volume {{producers}} typically utilize specialized {{tire and}} wheel mounting and inflation equipment which is partially or fully automated. Depending on the tire size, machines {{may be a}} single station or multistation. In these machines, the tire is inflated using high volume, high pressure compressed air that flows into the tire around the <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> rather than through the valve stem. When the tire has achieved the desired inflation pressure, the machine's inflation head {{moves away from the}} tire and the inflation process is completed.|$|E
5000|$|Motorcycle tires use a {{different}} style of beadlock, {{also known as a}} rim lock or <b>bead</b> stopper. Motorcycle <b>tire</b> rim locks clamp both beads at once because the tire is narrow enough do this conveniently with one device, and also {{there is no such thing}} as an [...] "inside bead" [...] and [...] "outside bead" [...] on a motorcycle tire. A curved metal plate inside the <b>tire</b> presses both <b>beads</b> outward against the inside of the wheel rim to clamp both beads at once in one localized area. A threaded stem attached to the plate is placed through a hole in the [...] "well" [...] of the rim, with the plate inside the tire and the threaded stem on the outside. The rim lock is tightened using either a standard bolt that leaves the threads visible, or a special bolt that covers the threads. The threaded stem or special bolt is visible on the inner surface of the wheel and points towards the axle, just like the valve stem.|$|R
40|$|Shredded {{rubber tire}} is a {{geomaterial}} that is potentially useful in environmental and engineering projects. Here, we study {{the effect of}} particle size ratio on the thermal conductivity of granular mixtures containing rubber <b>tire</b> particles. Glass <b>beads</b> were mixed at various volume fractions with rubber particles of varying size. The 3 D network model analysis using synthetic packed assemblies {{was used to determine}} the dominant factors influencing the thermal conduction of the mixtures. Results present that mixtures with varying size ratios exhibit different nonlinear evolutions of thermal conductivity values with mixture fractions. In particular, mixtures with large insulating materials (e. g., rubber particles) have higher thermal conduction that those with small ones. This is because the larger insulating particles allow better interconnectivity among the conductive particles, thereby avoiding the interruption of the thermal conduction of the conductive particles. Similar tests conducted with natural sand corroborate the significant effect of the relative size of the insulating particles. The 3 D network model identifies the heterogeneity of local and effective thermal conductivity and the influence of connectivity among conductive particles. A supplementary examination of electrical conductivity highlights the significance of local and long-range connectivity on conduction paths in granular mixtures...|$|R
5000|$|A {{need was}} {{experienced}} by avid 4x4 enthusiasts and overland travelers {{for a simple}} tool to effectively and efficiently remove the tire from the rim of a wheel, in cases where a tire requires repairs to the inside. On ATV's, as well as motorcycles, passenger vehicles, trucks, many industrial and offroad vehicles, as well as light aircraft have an additional feature on the rim called the Bead Retainer. The bead retainer is a bump like feature that prevents the <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> from slipping inward on the rim and losing the air seal. On ATV's (and UTV's/side-by-sides) this bead retainer is substantially large because these tires are often run at very low air pressures (~5 psi) and experience severe side loading forces from typical trail riding. The large bead retainer is necessary to prevent unintentional dislocation of the <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> from the bead seat. Further, if a ATV tire does lose pressure from a puncture, the large bead retainer will keep the Tire in place for low speed riding allowing the operator to navigate to the trail head without the tire coming completely off of the rim. The large bead retainers of ATV's do {{such a good job}} keeping the tire in place during operating conditions, it also prevents the tire from being easily changed with normal tools even in a shop setting.There are three categories of <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> breaker designs: 1) [...] "Shoe and Lever mechanism", 2) [...] "Plier-type mechanism", 3) [...] "Clamp and Ram mechanism". The Shoe and Lever mechanism performs well on many motorcycle tires, passenger vehicle tires and trailers, however with more difficult-to-change tires it often fails {{because of the nature of}} the design. The shoe pushes down on the tire sidewall next to the <b>tire</b> <b>bead,</b> and if the bead is stuck, the shoe will simply slide down the sidewall. [...] Further the Shoe and Lever mechanism is quite large, and is not a good portable solution for on-the-trail tire changes. Advantages are typically low cost, often less than $50, and can be found manufactured by many companies. The Plier-Type tool has a spike that pushes in between the <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> and lip of the rim, and can actually put a separating force on the bead bundle. However the pivot point results in a arc that quickly transitions to pushing on the sidewall. The Plier-type mechanism is more effective than the Shoe and Lever, however it has some disadvantages. It must be adjusted for different diameter wheels, it makes metal on metal contact with the rim, and can easily scratch and mar the surface of aluminum or painted wheels, it takes a bit of coordination and balance to use as you have to stand on the tire and use your body weight to operate the tool, and it is also fairly large, but ultimately is portable and is often used at race tracks for pit-stop tire changes. Ultimately, this type of bead breaker also struggles to work reliably on very stubborn ATV tires, 4x4 trucks, and tractors. The cost of the Plier-type is variable, form $75 to $200, and is manufactured by multiple companies. Lastly, the Clamp-and-Ram mechanism tool [...] is by far the most effective and compact tool for breaking beads on ATV's and other difficult-to-change tires. The only company who makes a this style of ATV Bead Breaker is BeadBuster. This style of tool has a pointed foot that enters the space between the <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> and lip of the rim, and it uses a padded clamp that is driven with a wrench to get pulled in all the way with very little user effort. The Ram foot then gets actuated by another bolt, with little effort by the user, and it completely breaks the bead loose in one motion. Because the tool is clamped in place, it cannot slide down the sidewall and damage the tire. The ram foot pushes directly on the steel bead bundle of the tire, and therefore works well on old and deteriorated tires. The Clamp and Ram tool (aka. [...] "BeadBuster") is extremely portable and easily fits in a tool box or glove compartment, and is priced at $99 up to $200 for a professional model.|$|E
50|$|A {{tubeless}} tire system requires an airtight rim — {{capable of being}} sealed at the valve stem, spoke holes (if they {{go all the way}} through the rim) and the <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> seat — and a compatible tire.Universal System Tubeless (UST), originally developed by Mavic, Michelin and Hutchinson for mountain bikes is the most common system of {{tubeless tire}}s/rims for bicycles. The main benefit of tubeless tires is the ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats because there is no tube to pinch between the rim and an obstacle.|$|E
5000|$|Three main {{techniques}} for attaching a bicycle tire to a rim have been developed: clincher, wired and tubular. [...] Clinchers originally {{did not have}} wire in the beads and {{the shape of the}} bead interlocked with a flange on the rim, relying on air pressure to hold the <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> in place. However, this type of tire is no longer in general use and the term clincher has transferred to the modern wired-on tire. For the remainder of this article, the modern use of the word clincher will be assumed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> is {{the part}} of the tire that {{contacts}} the rim on the wheel. The bead is typically reinforced with steel wire and compounded of high strength, low flexibility rubber. The bead seats tightly against the two rims on the wheel to ensure that a tubeless tire holds air without leakage. The bead fit is tight to ensure the tire does not shift circumferentially as the wheel rotates. The width of the rim in relationship to the tire is a factor in the handling characteristics of an automobile, because the rim supports the tire's profile.|$|E

The old nomenclature for tire size changed from measuring the outer diameter to measuring the rim diameter so 21 in (rim diameter) × 4.5 in (tire width) wheels has {{about the same}} outer diameter as 30 in (76 cm) clincher tires.

5000|$|The bead {{loosening}} system {{releases the}} <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> from {{the rim of}} the wheel. The bead loosening system consists of an arm near the bottom right side of the tire changer. There is a shovel shaped metal piece {{at the end of the}} arm called the bead loosener shoe. The bead loosener shoe pivots and is rounded to accommodate the shape of a wheel. On top of the arm, there is a handle with a button on top to engage the bead loosening system. Across from the shovel shaped metal piece, there are rubber squares to protect the wheel from scratches during the loosening procedure ...|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} beadlock {{is designed}} to clamp the <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> between an outer and an inner ring. The inner ring may be welded onto a standard wheel increasing wheel width by anywhere from 1½ to 2 inches or may be formed {{as part of the}} wheel when the wheel is made in the factory. The outer ring is then bolted onto the inner ring with the bead clamped between them. Anywhere between 16 and 32 bolts at around 10 ft·lbf are used around the circumference of the wheel to keep the clamp tight. The rings and bolts can cause problems with balancing the wheel and tire because all the added weight is on one side. This style is used exclusively for offroad use.|$|E
50|$|A {{growing number}} of teens and young adults were {{purchasing}} imported European sport racing or sport touring bicycles, many fitted with multiple derailleur-shifted gears. Schwinn decided {{to meet the challenge}} by developing two lines of sport or road 'racer' bicycles. One was already in the catalog — the limited production Paramount series. As always, the Paramount spared no expense; the bicycles were given high-quality lightweight lugged steel frames using double-butted tubes of Reynolds 531 and fitted with quality European components including Campagnolo derailleurs, hubs, and gears. The Paramount series had limited production numbers, making vintage examples quite rare today. Starting in 1960, {{for the rest of the}} market, Schwinn offered the Schwinn Varsity and Continental, now equipped as multi-geared sport bikes (10-speeds), and designed to imitate the style of the new narrow-tired 'racing' and sport bikes from Europe, though not their performance. The 1960 Varsity was introduced as an 8-speed bike, but in mid-1961 was upgraded to 10 speeds. Other road bikes were introduced by Schwinn in the early and mid 1960s, such as the Superior, Sierra, and Super Continental, but these were only produced for a few years. The Varsity and Continental sold in large numbers through the 1960s and early 1970s, becoming Scwhinn's leading models. The major difference between the two models was the use of a tubular front fork on the Continental -- both bikes used the same frame design, a lugless, steel unit, using Schwinn's standard Ashtabula cranksets and welded in such a way that the joints were smoothly filled (similar to the joints in 21st-century composite frames). The wheel rims were likewise robust, chromed, stamped steel with a unique profile designed to hold the <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> securely, even if pressure were low or lost.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{places in}} North America, length is {{commonly}} 48 feet or 53 feet, and width is either 96 or 102 inches (including rub rails and stake pockets on the sides, which generally placed every 2 feet). Some older trailers still in service are only 45 feet or shorter if used in sets of doubles or triples (often used to haul hay). Various lengths and combination setups {{can only be}} legally driven on turnpike/toll roads which are far too long for most roadways. Body and frame {{can be one of}} 3 general designs: the heaviest and sturdiest is all steel (usually with wood planks), Ever popular combo with steel frame and aluminium bed, these type often have wood portions for nailing down dunnage boards), and aluminium (which is the lightest allowing for more cargo to be legally carried without overweight permits). Incredibly light and very expensive to purchase, all aluminium trailers are very slippery when wet, flex more and are easily damaged. They also have a natural upwards bend so that when loaded they straighten out to be more flat, rather than to sag in the middle under a load. Another popular type of flatbed trailer is a stepdeck (or drop deck) with approximately 2 feet lower deck and low profile wheels to accommodate taller loads, without hitting low bridges or tunnels. These stepdecks can come with loading ramps to allow vehicles to roll on and off of the back from ground level. Shorter trailers used for local jobs such as landscaping and building material delivery within urban or local areas can have a [...] "hitchhiker" [...] type forklift truck attached to the back in order for driver alone to deliver and unload pallet/skid items. A bulkhead or [...] "headache rack" [...] is sometimes be attached to the front of either a straight or a stepdeck trailer for load securement {{at the front of the}} deck. In the event of long pipes or steel or lumber coming loose in a hard braking incident, they save the operator and cab/sleeper in one of two manners in theory. If attached to the trailer they bend while attempting to block forward motion of a loosened cargo, causing the long load to go above the cab and driver. If attached to the frame behind the cab or sleeper of the tractor, in theory they protect the back of the cab from impact and if unable to stop the load coming thru the cab, they cause the cab to be knocked off of.the frame, rather than impale the cab and kill or seriously injure the driver.48 and 53 ft lengths usually have two axles spread out to over 10 ft apart at the rear [...] "California spread" [...] in order to allow for more weight distribution on the rear of the deck (40,000 lb instead of 34,000 for a tandem axles design). So-called Cali spread was originally designed to comply with bridge weight formulas in that state but has since been adopted in most other parts of the country. These spread axles take far wider turning radius, and if turning the combination tractor/trailer too sharply, the front axle tires of the trailer may damage the road/parking lot surface, or pop a <b>tire</b> <b>bead</b> off of the rim, or both. Some trailers have the capability of lifting or lowering the front axle independently to mitigate this risk, however driver may not be able to use this feature if the trailer is loaded, but if the deck is empty the driver can lower the front axle to bring the rear axle off of the ground to significantly decrease turning radius of the rig for easy manoeuvre in tight spaces, or to reduce tire wear during empty /deadhead miles of travel. Under the deck of the trailer can be attached racks for spare tires, dunnage boards, or tire chains...as well as various tool/storage boxes. On one side (or often both sides for alternating pull on strap tension) are usually sliding (but sometimes fixed) winches to ratchet down 4 inch straps for load securement. On most 48 foot trailers, you may not place these strap/winches over a tire as when air pressure releases out of the suspension system when parked, the deck lowers down and will likely pop a trailer tire. Some trailers have an air scale which when the driver learns how to interpret properly through experience, combined with his knowledge of how much his/her rig weighs when empty and can interpret how much cargo can safely and legally be loaded onto the trailer. With different varying loads of cargo, driver can have an idea how much his gross total weight is (and if he is legal to avoid ticket) (80,000 without a permit in most states, but slightly lower in others). Some decks have pop up chain systems which have a higher WLL (working load limit) than attaching chains to either the stake pocket/spools, or the frame. Other decks of trailers can have sliding detachable accessories which greatly diversify your options of where and how to place a chain hook for securement. Besides axles which raise/lower as needed, some spread axle trailers can slide one or both axles forward, or back to create a tandem setup in specific situations when necessary, to comply with weight distribution requirements. Although certain amounts of front and rear cargo overhang is allowed (as well as overhang to one or both sides of the trailer) with flags/banners/flashing lights to warn drivers behind and to the side of you of impending danger of impalement if they follow too close behind you and you should have to suddenly stop...in extreme cases permit loads require escort be led front rear or both for oversize/over dimension cargo/equipment.|$|E
