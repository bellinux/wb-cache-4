In spite of these advantages, storage of cowpea has always been limited by pests and diseases leading to their deterioration. Insect pests are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>constrain</b> in cowpea storage and also fungal diseases growing on or in stored cowpea causing a variety of losses, which includes decrease in germinability, discoloration, heating and mustiness, and change in taste. Therefore, for efficient storage of cowpea, control measures must be adopted through the use of good storage structures, use of conventional chemicals, and use of plant materials. Also recommended practices for cowpea storage must be adhere to and also proper storage would reduce losses and guarantee near even prices for the commodity throughout the year in various parts of Nigeria...|$|E

However, until now, there has been limited effort to systematically develop heuristics {{that can be applied}} to a variety of synthesis tasks. We focus on development of general optimization principles {{so that they can be}} applied to a wide range of synthesis problems. In particular, we propose a new way to realize <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>constraining</b> principle where at each step we gradually relax the constraints on <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>constrained</b> elements of <b>the</b> solution. This basic optimization mechanism is augmented with several new heuristic principles: minimal freedom reduction, negative thinking, calibration, simultaneous step consideration, and probabilistic modeling. We have successfully applied these optimization principles to a number of common behavioral synthesis tasks. Specifically, we demonstrate a systematic way to develop optimization algorithms for maximum independent set, time-constrained scheduling, and soft real-time system scheduling. The effectiveness of the approach and algorithms is validated on extensive real-life benchmarks. 1...|$|R

40|$|Researchers {{have viewed}} {{constraints}} as {{a subset of}} reasons for not engaging in a particular behavior. This study investigates the impact of two-way interactions between age, income, and life stage (forming groups of more and less constrained respondents) on dependent variables comprising intentions held by Australian residents to travel intrastate, interstate or overseas for a vacation. A representative sample of 49, 105 Australian respondents is utilized. Binary logistic regression is used to profile respondents who intend to take a domestic or an overseas holiday of more than three days duration. This paper finds that the interactions between the constraint variables of age, income and life stage are important in explaining travel preferences.
