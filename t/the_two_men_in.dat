5|$|The Hoare–Laval Pact of December 1935 was {{an attempt}} by the British Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare and the French Prime Minister Pierre Laval to end the {{conflict}} in Abyssinia by proposing to partition the country into an Italian sector and an Abyssinian sector. Mussolini was prepared to agree to the pact, but news of the deal leaked out. Both the British and French public vehemently protested against it, describing it as a sell-out of Abyssinia. Hoare and Laval were forced to resign, and the British and French governments dissociated themselves from <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men.</b> <b>In</b> June 1936, although there was no precedent for a head of state addressing the Assembly of the League of Nations in person, Haile Selassie spoke to the Assembly, appealing for its help in protecting his country.|$|E
25|$|The Barron Report {{noted that}} {{although}} Weir maintained that Jackson and Billy Hanna had links to Nairac and British Military Intelligence, his claim did {{not imply that}} the British Army or Military Intelligence had aided <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> the planning and perpetration of the 1974 Dublin bombings. While in prison, Weir {{wrote a letter to}} a friend claiming that Nairac had ties to both Jackson and James Mitchell, owner of the Glenanne farm.|$|E
25|$|The four {{victims were}} Hazar Turki and Dina Turki, two sisters {{in their early}} twenties, and two men, Michel Bahus (the driver) and Nader Hayek; all were Arab {{citizens}} of Israel. The wounded were rushed to Rambam Medical Center in Haifa. In {{the days after the}} attack, 40,000 people attended a funeral service in honor of the victims in the town.

25|$|The {{latter part}} of Gibbs' tenure as Chief Justice was {{dominated}} by allegations of impropriety against Lionel Murphy, a fellow justice of the High Court. The Age newspaper published transcriptions of conversations between Murphy and NSW solicitor Morgan Ryan, alleging an improper relationship between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> February 1984. Two Senate Committees were established {{to look into the}} matter along with the Stewart Royal Commission in NSW to look into the tapes. A lengthy court case ensued resulting in Murphy's acquittal.|$|E
25|$|Havel was re-elected {{president}} in 1998. He had {{to undergo a}} colostomy in Innsbruck when his colon ruptured {{while he was on}} holiday in Austria. Havel left office after his second term as Czech president ended on 2 February 2003. Václav Klaus, one of his greatest political adversaries, was elected his successor as President on 28 February 2003. Margaret Thatcher wrote of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> her foreign policy treatise Statecraft, reserving the greater respect for Havel. Havel's dedication to democracy and his steadfast opposition to the Communist ideology earned him admiration.|$|E
25|$|The sixth {{match was}} between Meng, Crowbar and WCW Hardcore Champion Terry Funk in a Triple Threat {{match for the}} WCW Hardcore Championship. The match started out with Crowbar hitting Funk with a steel chair, and then {{dragging}} him backstage, where Meng joined <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> the brawl {{using a variety of}} weapons. In the climax of the match, Crowbar applied a figure four leglock on Funk which was broken up by Meng who was then attacked by Funk and Meng with steel chairs. Meng then superkicked a chair into Meng's face followed by making Funk submit to the Tongan Death Grip to win the WCW Hardcore Championship.|$|E

25|$|According to Beckett, it was Camilleri who {{spotted the}} girls walking single file along the Bega-Tathra Road in Evan's Hill and stopped {{to offer them}} a lift. At {{approximately}} 10pm, after a brief discussion with the men the girls entered the car willingly, according to Beckett. A pink portable television set, which had earlier been taken by Camilleri and Beckett from a friend {{in lieu of a}} drug-related debt was removed from {{the back seat of the}} vehicle and discarded at the side of the road to provide room for the girls to sit. The television set would later become important evidence and implicate <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> their crimes to follow.|$|E
25|$|This decree of an Italian rabbi {{pronounced}} {{against a}} Turkish colleague was an unprecedented {{attack on the}} rights of the community, and provoked the righteous indignation of the Jewish social order in Constantinopleall the more as it proved to rest upon a groundless and vulgar calumny. Capsali, conscious of having been maligned, did not mince matters in answering Colon's letters; and a bitter discussion arose between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men,</b> <b>in</b> which the leading rabbis of Germany, Italy, and the Orient took part. It is characteristic of Colon that as soon as he became convinced that he had been the victim of an intrigue, and so had done injustice to the ḥakham bashi, he did not hesitate to make amends. On his deathbed, he commissioned his son Perez to go to Constantinople and ask, in his father's name, the forgiveness of Capsali.|$|E
25|$|The fallout was swift. Gardiner, Higgs and Russell {{resigned}} from Cabinet {{and issued a}} press statement giving {{their views on the}} situation, which cleared the usually pro-government censors because Higgs temporarily held the Defence portfolio, due to George Pearce's absence in Western Australia, so Hughes was unable to prevent its publication. The government was threatened with collapse, with four of the nine members of the First Hughes Ministry having quit. The publicity about Hughes' peremptory move and its consequences was a disaster, coming {{on the eve of the}} poll, and the veneer of a unified and strong government under Hughes was destroyed. Hughes, distraught and overwrought, called the Governor-General at midnight, saying he had no one else to talk to, and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> the wee-hours of the morning, with Lord Novar offering sympathy and support to his old colleague, but ultimately both understood that the cause was probably lost.|$|E

25|$|Starting with Étienne Lucier in 1829, {{a steady}} number of {{primarily}} French-Canadian {{employees of the}} HBC became farmers in the Willamette Valley. Their agricultural products were sold to the HBC and continued to use Fort Vancouver as their source of needed material and household goods. These men eventually contacted bishop Provencher through McLoughlin and requested priests to be sent. Eventually Provencher selected François Norbert Blanchet and Modeste Demers as capable for traveling to the distant Willamette Valley. In correspondence to HBC officials he requested overland transportation for <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> 1837. The fur merchants saw this as a useful opportunity to further the still paper PSAC. French-Canadians farmers residing in the Willamette Valley could potentially be induced to relocate to more favorable locations north of the Columbia. The Catholic priests could additionally counter any Methodist influence over the French-Canadians by superintendent Jason Lee. However, they utterly failed to convince any farmer to leave the Willamette Valley.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his {{predecessors}} Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, who typical painted exterior wings in grisaille, Memling shows the saints in a realistic manner. Although the donors in van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece and van der Weyden's Beaune Altarpiece are also painted realistically, they are placed within architectural niches {{separate from the}} adjacent statue-like grisaille saints. Memling breaks with that tradition in these exterior panels, but the subdued palette he uses retains some sense of grisaille. The donors are dressed in their Augustinian habits; <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> stark black and the two women in white on black. The saints are dressed in monochromatic clothing. St James wears a light blue cloak and St Anthony's is grey. St Agnes is dressed in drab green and St Clare is also in a dark habit. Although the figures {{seem to be in}} two niches, they are enclosed in a single shallow space, with stone walls behind, trefoil arches above, and two columns adorning the outermost edges. Where the wings open is a single column which has the appearance of two separate columns.|$|E
25|$|The {{rift between}} Gordon and Sievers climaxed on 14 July 1721 when, at a banquet commemorating {{the battle of}} 'Hango Head,' a violent quarrel broke out between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> the {{presence}} of the Tsar. Gordon complained about the Dane’s behaviour towards him and pointed out that, as Seivers was responsible for the appointments of lieutenants and all inferiors, he was appointing the best officers and men to the Danish and Dutch commanders. The General-Admiral, Count Apraxin, did his best to justify the actions of Rear Admiral Sievers and maintained that Gordon had falsely accused him of partiality when dividing the officers and men. During his conversation he referred to Gordon as ‘your admiral’ to Peter the Great which was not well received. As Sievers was going to leave the Tsar’s service {{at the end of the}} campaign, it was left like that. The next day Peter called the two admirals together and made them drink a glass of wine together hoping that this would end their bickering.|$|E

25|$|The {{thirteen}} civilians—men, {{women and}} children–have been rounded up for slaughter or enslavement. They are harshly {{presented to the}} viewer in an almost flat plane; slumped, disordered, and unevenly distributed. Their arrangement principally comprises two human pyramids–one pyramid {{to the left of}} the canvas culminating in the man with the red fez, and the other to the right culminating in the mounted soldier. The area between the two pyramids contains two soldiers in shadow, and two more Greek victims–a young man embraced by a young woman. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> the pyramid to the left are injured. The man at the front is on or near to the point of death, and the man poised at the top of the group appears unable to prepare a defence for himself. His gaze is in the direction of the suffering children in front of him, but it does not fall on them. This seeming detachment, coupled with the vacant stare of the dying man lend to this group an air of despondent resignation.|$|E
25|$|On March 7, 2012, Cameron {{took the}} Deepsea Challenger {{submersible}} {{to the bottom}} of the New Britain Trench in a five-mile-deep solo dive. On March 26, 2012, Cameron reached the Challenger Deep, the deepest part of the Mariana Trench. He spent more than three hours exploring the ocean floor before returning to the surface. Cameron is the first person to accomplish the trip solo. He was preceded by unmanned dives in 1995 and 2009 and by Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh, who were the first men to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench aboard the Bathyscaphe Trieste in 1960. Cameron has made a three-dimensional film of his dive. During his dive to the Challenger Deep, the data he collected resulted in interesting new finds in the field of marine biology, including new species of sea cucumber, squid worm, and giant single-celled amoeba, which are exciting finds due to the harshness of the environment. Cameron is also one of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> history to stand on Challenger Deep.|$|E
25|$|The raiders' luck {{held and}} both the car and lorry were able to {{re-enter}} the Republic of Ireland without incident. At the Monaghan side of the border, {{a member of the}} Royal Ulster Constabulary gave the lorry the right of way and were able to drive the last 7 miles safely. The party split up at a dump in County Meath, upon meeting with IRA Chief of Staff Tony Magan, with some making their way back to Dublin by bus. Boyce and Joe Christie, another member of the raid, were to drive the lorry back to Dublin themselves. While Boyce sat {{in the back of the}} lorry, Christie climbed into the drivers' cabin and ordered the driver to divert from the pre-arranged route and onto the main roads. They eventually attracted the attention of a Garda police car on the outskirts of Dublin, having heard news of the Armagh raid, and attempted to block the road. Christie told the driver to ram the car but it was able to pull out of the way. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> the lorry were later taken into custody when returning it to its owner. They were questioned by police but were released partly due to lack of evidence, nothing save two revolvers were found in the truck, and the Irish government's embarrassment over the incident.|$|E
