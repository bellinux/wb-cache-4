40|$|Six new {{evaporator}} tubes were coated internally with food-grade ‘non-stick ’ fluoropolymer material {{recommended by}} an international chemical company and applied by an accredited coating agent in North America. The tubes were then fitted to the fourth effect of the evaporator at UCL Co Ltd, taking special precautions to minimise damage to the coating during tube expansion. The tubes were used for an entire season without cleaning. Scale did accumulate {{at the ends of}} some of the tubes where the <b>tube</b> <b>expander</b> had damaged the coating, but the major tube length remained free of scale. Based on a single season, the tube coating appears to be technically promising, although there are challenges of high cost, unknown durability and the need to develop an in situ coating technique. The non-stick coated tubes have the potential to reduce or even eliminate the need to clean evaporator tubes during a crushing season. This in turn could lead to substantial reduction in maintenance downtime and cost, which in turn could lead to an increase in overall processing capacity for the season. The new coating also has the potential to eliminate reduction in heat transfer coefficient caused by scale formation between cleaning...|$|E
40|$|Regional {{silicone}} gel {{migration from}} a ruptured breast implant {{has been reported}} at different locations including the upper extremity, chest wall muscles, axilla and back. We report a patient who presented with an axillary mass that mimicked a regional recurrence 5 years after breast cancer reconstruction with a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap and silicon gel expander-prosthesis. Surgical exploration revealed that the mass contained silicone gel around the port of the breast expander that had ruptured. The mass was confluent with an intracapsular silicone leak through a tract along the <b>tube</b> of the <b>expander</b> port.

50|$|The stem, of the quill variety, is {{attached}} to the fork's steerer <b>tube</b> using an <b>expander</b> bolt which fits through the stem from the top with a wedge at the bottom, the stem fits inside the steerer tube and can be adjusted to the correct height without disturbing the headset. To free the stem for adjustment, undo the bolt {{on the top of the}} stem a couple of turns and give the bolt a sharp tap to disengage the wedge.|$|R
5000|$|With {{threadless}} stems, a [...] "star-nut" [...] {{is driven}} {{down into the}} threadless steerer tube and {{held in place by}} two barbed flanges. The top cap bolts into, and pulls against, the star-nut, thereby preloading the headset bearings. (See: photograph of Star-nut) Newer model forks, with carbon fiber steerer <b>tubes,</b> use an <b>expander</b> plug instead of a star nut, which once installed serves the same purpose as the star nut, but will not damage carbon fiber forks as a starnut will (by design a star-nut digs into the surrounding tube, which, while safe with aluminum, can weaken carbon fiber to the point of failure).|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe early hepatic venous outflow {{obstruction}} (HVOO) {{is a rare}} but serious complication after liver transplantation, {{which may}} result in graft loss. We report a case of early HVOO after living donor liver transplantation, which was managed by ectopic placement of foley catheter. PresentationA 51 years old male patient with end stage liver disease received a right hemi-liver graft. On the first postoperative day the patient developed impairment of the liver functions. Doppler ultrasound (US) showed absence of blood flow in the right hepatic vein without thrombosis. The decision was to re-explore the patient, which showed torsion of the graft upward {{and to the right}} side causing HVOO. This was managed by ectopic placement of a foley catheter between the graft and the diaphragm and the chest wall. Gradual deflation of the catheter was gradually done guided by Doppler US and the patient was discharged without complications. DiscussionMechanical HVOO results from kinking or twisting of the venous anastomosis due to anatomical mismatch between the graft and the recipient abdomen. It should be managed surgically by repositioning of the graft or redo of venous anastomosis. Several ideas had been suggested for repositioning and fixation of the graft by the use of Sengstaken–Blakemore <b>tubes,</b> tissue <b>expanders,</b> and surgical glove expander. ConclusionWe report the use of foley catheter to temporary fix the graft and correct the HVOO. It is a simple and safe way, and could be easily monitored and removed under Doppler US without any complications...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the simulation and performance {{analysis of a}} regenerative and superheated Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). To this scope, anew simulation model has been developed. The model is based on zero-dimensional energy and mass balances for all {{the components of the}} system. Shell and <b>tube</b> heat <b>expanders</b> with single shell and double tube pass have been chosen. Pump and expander have been considered only form a thermodynamic point of view, with constant compressor and expansion efficiency. The simulations have been carried out in order to find different optimization criteria to use as preliminary design tools, especially for the organic fluid choice and the heat exchanger design. Firstly, the ORC performances have been evaluated for different organic medium, varying the temperature of the heat source. The global efficiency of the plant, the net electric power generation and the volumetric expansion ratio has been considered as evaluation parameters. The simulation results show that two hydrocarbons demonstrate good performance for low, medium and high heat source, namely Isobutene, n-Butene; R 245 fa can add to them for the exploitation of heat source up to 170 Â°C. Additional simulations have been carried out to discover an optimization criterion for the heat exchanger design. The plant performances have been first evaluated varying one by one the following parameters: tube length, tube number and shell diameter. Then a global optimization was also performed using the Golden Search technique. The total cost of the plant has been considered as objective functions. With respect to the objective function, higher the boiling heat transfer area higher the electric power generation and the economical benefit. The optimal configuration, compared to the initial one, shows an increase of incomes and mechanical power equal to 60. 1 and 48. 2 % respectively, against a decrease of global efficiency equal to 10. 9 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{insertion}} of a chest drain into the pleural space {{is a common}} procedure used by many specialties. The commonly used device is a prepacked, sterile plastic tube with its own central metal trocar. Complications may arise during its insertion, with the occasional penetration of intrathoracic and upper abdominal organs. As most chest drains are inserted by junior and relatively inexperienced doctors, it is therefore imperative that a simple, safe, and effective technique of insertion is found. A device has been developed that consists of a 5 cm conical length of an expansible cannula, made from rolled metal foil, which when inserted into the chest reaches only a few millimetres within the pleura. When an <b>expander</b> <b>tube,</b> 10 mm in diameter, is passed through the device from its proximal end the conical tube is distended into a hollow cylindrical one, through which a standard Portex chest catheter is passed. The whole appliance is then removed over {{the end of the}} tube, leaving the drain in situ. The efficacy of this unique device has been tested in a pilot study in 22 patients. There have been no complications...|$|R
