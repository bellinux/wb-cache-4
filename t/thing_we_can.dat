25|$|Livestock {{production}} {{is by far}} the biggest cause of land use, as it accounts for 30% of the global land surface. It is probably the leading player in biodiversity loss, as it causes deforestation, land degradation, pollution, climate change, overfishing, and invasions by alien species. Livestock is also responsible for at least 20% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, which are the main cause of the current climate change. This is due to feed production, enteric fermentation from ruminants, manure storage and processing, and transportation of animal products. The greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production greatly exceeds the greenhouse gas emissions of any other human activity. Some authors argue that by far the best <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do to slow climate change is a global shift towards a vegetarian or vegan diet.|$|E

The mission of the organization is to promote solutions with elected officials and the general public. The couple states that it supports the Second Amendment while promoting responsible gun ownership and “keeping guns {{out of the hands}} of dangerous people like criminals, terrorists, and the mentally ill.” Current gun laws allow for private sellers to legally sell guns without a background check, creating a loophole that provides criminals and the mentally ill easy access to guns. Kelly said on Fox News on March 31, 2013, that “any bill that does not include a universal background check is a mistake, It's the most common sense <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from having access to weapons." ...|$|E

[...] Androzani.com said of the episode, [...] "It's awful. It's horrific. It seriously, seriously sucks," [...] adding [...] "the single nice <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> find to say is that the concept had potential." [...] Seb Patrick of Noise to Signal thought, [...] "despite a strong - and {{somewhat}} morally ambiguous - ending [...] really should have delivered in more spectacular fashion than this." [...] Patrick also criticised Jack's personality throughout the episode, stating [...] "we wanted a spinoff series about him because he was cocky, cool and downright entertaining - Buzz Lightyear meets Ace Rimmer meets James Bond. We didn't want some grumpy immortal bastard with a chip on his shoulder." [...] Despite the mixed reviews however, the series producers and BBC controller of fiction Jane Tranter regard the episode as one of their favourites from the first series.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{opened their}} Champions League {{campaign}} with a 3–0 defeat against Inter Milan. Goals from Julio Ricardo Cruz, Andy van der Meyde and Obafemi Martins {{all in the}} first half extended Arsenal's run of six home games in the competition without a win. Wenger said afterwards: [...] "We can complain and cry the whole night but that will not change the result. The only <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do is to respond." [...] The team, without Campbell and Vieira, earned a draw away to Lokomotiv Moscow, but remained bottom of the group. Arsenal lost to Dynamo Kyiv in late October; Wenger's decision to shift from his preferred 4–4–2 formation caused the team to play more narrow than usual. Cole scored the winning goal in the reverse fixture at Highbury. A cross by Wiltord was flicked on by Henry in the direction of an incoming Cole, who dived to head the ball past goalkeeper Oleksandr Shovkovskiy.|$|E

This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do, try again.

The paper included a statement that the authors were not advocating the possibility that the species could be ancestral to later anthropoid primates; Professor John Fleagle, of Stony Brook University in New York state, asserted {{that he was one of}} the anonymous scientific reviewers of the paper and that he had explicitly requested before publication that the authors tone down their original claims that the fossil was on the human evolutionary line. At the press conference the fossil was described as the [...] "missing link" [...] in human evolution. Hurum said that “this fossil rewrites our understanding of the evolution of primates...it will probably be pictured in all the textbooks for the next 100 years" [...] and compared its importance to the Mona Lisa. He also said that Darwinius was [...] "the closest <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> get to a direct ancestor" [...] and that finding it was [...] "a dream come true". Team member Jens Franzen said the state of preservation was [...] "like the Eighth Wonder of the World", with information [...] "palaeontologists can normally only dream of", but while he said it bore [...] "a close resemblance to ourselves" [...] in some aspects, other features indicated that it was not a direct ancestor.|$|E

[...] Ben Dowell from the Radio Times thought the description of Mick sounded like comedian Al Murray's Pub Landlord character. Former EastEnders cast member Scott Maslen, who played Jack Branning, said of Dyer's casting in the show: [...] "He will go there, give a bit of banter and he will embrace it, but it'll be a challenge for him.
