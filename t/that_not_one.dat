5|$|The Act of December 11 was {{the second}} stage in the {{progression}} towards the final Act of Independence. The first draft, demanded by chancellor Georg von Hertling, was prepared by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 1. Further changes were jointly prepared by the German chancellery and by a delegation of the Council of Lithuania. The delegation's members were Antanas Smetona, Steponas Kairys, Vladas Mironas, Jurgis Šaulys, Petras Klimas and Aleksandras Stulginskis. After discussion amongst the parties, a compromise was reached on the document's text. The German representative, Kurt von Lersner, insisted <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> word be changed in the agreed-upon text and that all the Council members sign the document.|$|E

25|$|The {{fortress}} of Pamplona {{sat on the}} south bank of the Arga River, surrounded by walls. A powerful citadel was located {{on the south side}} of the fortress. Two outlying forts were abandoned and demolished by Cassan because they required over-large garrisons. Wellington insisted that no formal siege be undertaken and refused to send any of his heavy artillery pieces to reinforce O'Donnell's 12 field pieces. The Allied siege guns were reserved for the Siege of San Sebastián. The Spanish blockade was maintained by setting up an inner cordon of pickets around the city. The outer cordon incorporated fortified villages and the nine redoubts constructed by the engineers, each armed with two cannons. So effective was the blockade <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> communication passed between the garrison and Marshal Soult.|$|E
25|$|On October 22, Commander Hay in the Phlegethon, {{with some}} of the boats, went to destroy the {{remaining}} pirate ships. That day the Qing navy destroyed four junks and after regrouping with Hay, they sunk two more. Clearly defeated; Shap Ng-tsai took two third-rate and four fourth-rate junks with his 400 remaining men and retreated further up the river. That marked the end of the combat. A total of fifty-eight junks were destroyed with an estimated 2,400 killed or wounded and about 300 captured. Over 1,200 pirate guns were also captured. One significant factor of the battle was <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> man under Hay's command was killed or wounded but the Chinese and Vietnamese did suffer some casualties. All of the expedition ships were damaged in some way including at least three of the armed boats which were raked by cannon fire.|$|E
25|$|Although same-language {{subtitles}} and captions {{are produced}} primarily with the deaf and {{hard of hearing}} in mind, many hearing film and television viewers choose to use them. This is often done because the presence of closed captioning and subtitles ensures <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> word of dialogue will be missed. Bars and other noisy public places, where film dialogue would otherwise be drowned out, often make closed captions visible for patrons. Viewers may also find thick regional accents from other same-language countries hard to understand without subtitles. Films and television shows often have subtitles displayed in the same language if the speaker has a speech impairment. In addition, captions may reveal information {{that would otherwise be}} difficult to obtain from hearing. Some examples would be song lyrics, dialog spoken quietly or by those with accents unfamiliar to the intended audience, or supportive, minor dialog from background characters. It is argued that such additional information and detail enhances the overall experience and allows the viewer a better grasp of the material. Furthermore, people learning a foreign language may sometimes use same-language subtitles to better understand the dialog without having to resort to a translation.|$|E

500|$|When Rep. James Henry Hammond of South Carolina {{looked to}} prevent anti-slavery {{petitions}} {{from reaching the}} House floor, however, Pierce sided with the abolitionists' right to petition. Nevertheless, Pierce supported {{what came to be}} known as the gag rule, which allowed for petitions to be received, but not read or considered. This passed the House in 1836. He was attacked by the New Hampshire anti-slavery Herald of Freedom as a [...] "doughface", which had the dual meaning of [...] "craven-spirited man" [...] and [...] "northerner with southern sympathies". Pierce had stated <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> in 500 New Hampshirites were abolitionists; the Herald of Freedom article added up the number of signatures on petitions from that state, divided by the number of residents according to the 1830 census, and suggested the actual number was one in 33. Pierce was outraged when South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun read the article on the Senate floor as [...] "proof" [...] that New Hampshire was a hotbed of abolitionism. Calhoun apologized after Pierce replied to him in a speech which stated that most signatories were women and children, who could not vote, which therefore cast doubt on the one in 33 figure.|$|E

500|$|Gilbert {{had already}} started work on a new opera {{involving}} a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge. The composer wrote, on 1 April 1884 that he had [...] "come {{to the end of}} my tether" [...] with the operas: [...] "I have been continually keeping down the music in order <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> [...] should be lost. ... I should like to set a story of human interest & probability where the humorous words would come in a humorous (not serious) situation, & where, if the situation were a tender or dramatic one the words would be of similar character." [...] In a lengthy exchange of correspondence, Sullivan pronounced Gilbert's plot sketch (particularly the [...] "lozenge" [...] element) unacceptably mechanical, and too similar in both its grotesque [...] "elements of topsyturveydom" [...] and in actual plot to their earlier work, especially The Sorcerer, and repeatedly requested that Gilbert find a new subject. The impasse was finally resolved on 8 May when Gilbert proposed a plot that did not depend on any supernatural device. The result was Gilbert and Sullivan's most successful work, The Mikado (1885). The piece ran for 672 performances, which was the second-longest run for any work of musical theatre, and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece, up to that time.|$|E
500|$|Much {{speculation}} {{appeared in}} the press as {{to the cause of}} Ellen's illness; some linked the case to that of Sarah Jacob, a girl from Wales who, her parents claimed, was able to survive without nourishment, through divine intervention. Sarah died of starvation in 1869, and her parents were subsequently convicted of manslaughter. A journalist for The Observer commented, [...] "It is to be hoped that [...] is known in the obscure village of Turville, where—we are asked to believe—a fresh case of miraculous trance has taken place.... very much... incites suspicion of deliberate imposture." [...] One correspondent to The Times wrote, [...] "It is by widespread publicity that such cases are multiplied, {{and it is difficult to}} overstate the harm thus done. These impostures exist through a morbid love of sympathy on the part of the children, or from the gains that accrue to the parents. Once begun, they soon pass into real disease." [...] Another said the [...] "ridiculous mystery" [...] could be resolved if only Ellen were transferred, over her mother's continued objections, to a London hospital, a sentiment echoed by many. Claims that Ellen was suffering from a form of catalepsy—a condition at the time considered [...] "so rare <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> physician in a thousand has so much as seen a single case of it"—were also disregarded as unlikely, as was any thought of religious ecstasy.|$|E
500|$|The British Army {{was armed}} with the Short Magazine Lee–Enfield Mk III (SMLE Mk III), which {{featured}} a bolt-action and large magazine capacity that enabled a trained rifleman to fire 20–30 aimed rounds a minute. World War I accounts tell of British troops repelling German attackers, who subsequently {{reported that they had}} encountered machine guns, when in fact, it was simply a group of trained riflemen armed with SMLEs. The heavy Vickers machine gun proved itself to be the most reliable weapon on the battlefield, with some of its feats of endurance entering military mythology. One account tells of the action by the 100th Company of the Machine Gun Corps at High Wood on 24 August 1916. This company had 10 Vickers guns; it was ordered to give sustained covering fire for 12 hours onto a selected area [...] away, to prevent German troops forming up there for a counterattack while a British attack was in progress. Two companies of infantry were allocated as ammunition, rations and water carriers for the gunners. Two men worked a belt–filling machine non–stop for 12 hours, keeping up a supply of 250-round belts. They used 100 new barrels and all of the water—including the men's drinking water and the contents of the latrine buckets—to keep the guns cool. In that 12-hour period, the 10 guns fired just short of one million rounds between them. One team is reported to have fired 120,000. At the close of the operation, it is alleged that every gun was working perfectly and <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> had broken down during the whole period.|$|E

500|$|Rotten Tomatoes {{gave it a}} [...] "fresh" [...] 95% {{approval}} rating, {{based on}} 43 reviews and Metacritic gave it a 73, signifying [...] "generally favorable reviews". Many focused on the film's ending title cards: several compared them to a public service announcement, and Philip Kemp of Sight & Sound wrote, [...] "All that's missing is the address we should send donations to." [...] Zhang Xiaoling, on the other hand, considered the titles to be an implicit criticism {{of the state of}} rural education in China, saying, [...] "the news that voluntary contributions have helped 15 percent of the pupils to return to school is aimed to give rise to a question: what about the remaining 85 percent?" [...] The disagreement about the title cards is also reflected in the critical reaction {{to the rest of the}} film's resolution. Kemp described the ending as [...] "feelgood" [...] and criticized the film for portraying officials and generous cityfolk as coming to the rescue, The Washington Posts Desson Howe called the ending [...] "flag-waving", and The Independents Gilbert Adair called it [...] "sugary". Alberto Barbera of the Venice Film Festival, on the other hand, said that while the end of the film may have been like propaganda, the rest was a [...] "strong denunciation of a regime that is unable to assure proper education for the country children". Likewise, Zhang Xiaoling argued that although the film superficially appears to praise the city people and officials, its subtext is harshly critical of them: he pointed out that the apparently benevolent TV station manager seems to be motivated more by audience ratings than by altruism, that the receptionist's callous manner towards Wei is a result of Chinese [...] "bureaucratism and nepotism", and that for all the good things about the city, Zhang Huike's clearest memory of city life is having to beg for food. Zhang and Kraicer both argued that critics who see the film as pro-government propaganda are missing the point and, as Kraicer put it, [...] "mistaking [...] layer as the message of the film... mistaking the part for the whole". David Ansen of Newsweek and Leigh Paatsch of the Herald Sun each pointed out that, while the film is [...] "deceptive" [...] positive at face value, it has harsh criticism [...] "bubbling under the surface". Chinese critics Liu Xinyi and Xu Su of Movie Review recognized the dispute abroad over whether the film was pro- or anti-government, but made no comment; they praised the film for its realistic portrayal of hardships facing rural people, without speculating about whether Zhang intended to criticize or praise the government's handling of those hardships. Hao Jian of Film Appreciation, on the other hand, was more critical, claiming that the movie was organized around a political message and was intended to be pro-government. Hao said <b>that</b> <b>Not</b> <b>One</b> Less marked the beginning of Zhang's transformation from an outspoken independent director to one of the government's favorites.|$|E
