5|$|Route 41 runs at a {{frequency}} of 6 minutes during peak hours on weekdays, and 15 to 20 minutes at other times. Some <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> truncated to Northgate instead of serving Lake City. In spring 2015, Metro estimated that 10,000 daily riders used route 41 on weekdays.|$|E
5|$|The school offers extra-curricular {{activities}} during free time. It has a swimming pool, and offers trampolining, aerobics and fencing, {{as well as}} computer games, board games and Scalextric. Weekend <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> sometimes organised for climbing and mountain biking, or to the cinema or theatre.|$|E
5|$|The Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre is an {{independent}} educational charity situated near the beach in Charmouth; it provides information and displays on the geology of the area and the wildlife, including a large collection of fossils and a rockpool aquarium. Family fossil-hunting <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> organised from here {{as well as other}} events and activities related to the geology and natural history of the area.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trip</b> <b>is</b> a Finnish {{brand of}} juice {{produced}} and distributed by Marli. Launched in 1962, <b>Trip</b> <b>was</b> the first beverage in Finland {{to be sold}} in a laminated carton. Originally <b>Trip</b> cartons <b>were</b> pyramid shaped, but were changed to a cuboid shape in the 1990s and were made higher and more narrow in 2002 to better fit children hands. <b>Trip</b> <b>is</b> usually drunk using the straw attached to its packaging.|$|R
50|$|Road <b>Trip</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} and final album from American girl group Girl Authority. Unlike the first album, Road <b>Trip</b> <b>is</b> a mixture of cover songs and {{original}} songs performed by Girl Authority. Road <b>Trip</b> <b>is</b> also featured with a DVD, documenting a behind the scenes glance into {{the production of the}} album and the girls.|$|R
30|$|Step 3 : If the {{destination}} {{of a bus}} <b>trip</b> cannot <b>be</b> identified in Step 1 and 2, the historical smartcard records of the bus passenger [39] <b>are</b> used. Bus <b>trips</b> that share the same route, same boarding stop, and similar boarding time with the unidentified bus <b>trip</b> <b>are</b> analyzed. The similar historical bus trip that has the most similar boarding time to the unidentified <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> identified. And {{the destination}} of the historical bus <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> inferred as the destination of the unidentified bus trip.|$|R
5|$|The {{greatest}} risk in flying is in takeoff and landing, meaning that longer aircraft <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> safer per mile. Commuter planes used on shorter flights have higher risk than larger jet aircraft. Driving on U.S. Interstate highways, which {{are almost always}} controlled-access divided highways, is safer than driving on most other roads and highways.|$|E
5|$|Aberdaron hosts {{numerous}} sailing regattas featuring clinker built boats {{unique to}} the area; there is a popular regatta every August where the races are open to everyone. Sea angling <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> operated from Porth Meudwy, fishing for pollock, coley and mackerel; wrasse, bass, mullet and gurnard are also possible. Bass and coley can be caught from the rocks at Porth Iago; and wrasse, pollock and mackerel are plentiful. Access is difficult at Uwchmynydd, but pollock, mackerel, wrasse and conger are caught; huss are plentiful; and ling are found occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses {{are popular}} birds for birdwatchers and their colonies are popular {{destinations}} for ecotourists. Regular birdwatching <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> {{taken out of}} many coastal towns and cities, like Monterey, Dunedin, Kaikoura, Wollongong, Sydney, Port Fairy, Hobart and Cape Town, to see pelagic seabirds. Albatrosses are easily attracted to these sightseeing boats by the deployment of fish oil and burley into the sea. Visits to colonies can be very popular: the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in Dunedin, New Zealand, attracts 40,000 visitors a year, and more isolated colonies are regular attractions on cruises to subantarctic islands.|$|E
50|$|A linked <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> a <b>trip</b> {{from the}} origin to the {{destination}} on the transit system. Even if a passenger must make several transfers during a journey, the <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> counted as one linked {{trip on the}} system.|$|R
50|$|Atthough {{most of the}} High <b>Trips</b> <b>were</b> in the Sierra Nevada, {{occasionally}} <b>trips</b> <b>were</b> {{scheduled to}} other mountain ranges of western North America, including Mount Rainier in 1905, Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, and the Canadian Rockies in 1928.|$|R
5000|$|If {{this is the}} passenger's {{first trip}} using the card, or their {{previous}} validation was over two hours ago (for 1-4 zones, 3 hours for 5-8 zones), a <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> deducted from the card, and {{the information about the}} current <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> printed onto the front of the card. If the passenger is transferring between services, and their current <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> still valid, a [...] "T" [...] is printed onto the card (on 10-trip MultiRiders only).|$|R
5|$|Eurostar {{passengers}} travelling {{inside the}} Schengen Area (Brussels-Lille or Brussels-Calais; Lille-Calais <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> not allowed) {{pass through a}} separate corridor in Brussels bypassing border checks, and enter carriage 18 of the train, which is reserved for these passengers. This arrangement was set up after numerous illegal immigrants entered the UK without {{the right to do}} so, by buying a ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais but remaining on the train until London – an issue exacerbated by Belgian police threatening to arrest UK Border Agency staff at Brussels-Midi if they tried to prevent passengers whom they suspected of attempting to exploit this loophole from boarding Eurostar trains.|$|E
5|$|Fares are AR$7.50 per {{trip on the}} Subte, {{though these}} can be as low as AR$4.50 per trip {{depending}} on how many <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> made per month, while the Premetro has a flat rate of AR$1.50. While tokens {{have been used in}} the past, at present, riders use contactless cards called SUBE, which are rechargeable with multiple forms of payment. Previously, single or multi-use paper cards with a magnetic strip (called Subtepass) were used, however, these were phased out of the system in May 2016, opting instead only to use the digital cards, with the exception of some retired, disabled and student cards. Trains run from 05:00 until 23:00, every 3–4minutes, for all lines except Line H which has a frequency of around 6minutes. Under modernisation plans commenced in 2013, service frequencies are set to increase to an average of one train every 2:20 by 2019.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} is {{generally}} conducted {{on a daily}} basis, from dawn to dusk when they have chicks to feed. Overnight <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> sometimes made, especially as the chicks grow older; a 2008 study that used surgically implanted data loggers to track {{the movement of the}} birds showed the foraging trips become longer once the chick-rearing period is over. Birds venture out for 10–20 days during incubation and before the moult. Macaroni penguins are known to be the largest single consumer of marine resources among all of the seabirds, with an estimated take of 9.2 million tonnes of krill a year. Outside the breeding season, macaroni penguins tend to dive deeper, longer, and more efficiently during their winter migration than during the summer breeding season. Year round, foraging dives usually occur during daylight hours, but winter dives are more constrained by daylight due to the shorter days.|$|E
50|$|Road trip, one of {{the more}} {{original}} elements of the hunt, is constrained by several factors. The furthest destination may be no more than 1,000 miles from Chicago and the <b>trip</b> must <b>be</b> completed between 8 a.m. Thursday morning and Saturday night. Additionally, road <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> completed with participants wearing ridiculous costumes. Items for the road <b>trip</b> <b>are</b> scattered throughout the main list.|$|R
50|$|The no. 1 bus {{continued}} {{to follow the}} Druid Hill Park-Ft. McHenry routing until 1982, when selected hourly weekday <b>trips</b> <b>were</b> extended from Druid Hill Park to Sinai Hospital along Greenspring Avenue. In 1993, all midday <b>trips</b> <b>were</b> rerouted to Sinai Hospital.|$|R
50|$|Amtrak {{took over}} {{intercity}} passenger service from private operators on May 1, 1971. Although many trains were discontinued with the takeover, Metroliner service increased to 9 round trips. Schedules further increased to 12 round trips on an hourly schedule on November 14, 1971; one <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> extended to New Haven, Connecticut (then the northern limit of electrification). Two more round <b>trips</b> <b>were</b> added on May 1, 1972, and the all-time maximum of 15 round <b>trips</b> <b>was</b> reached on October 28, 1973.|$|R
25|$|Another {{approach}} {{is to reduce the}} capacity to park cars. Starting in the 1970s, the city of Copenhagen, where now 36% of the <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> done by bicycle, adopted a policy of reducing available car parking capacity by several per cent per year. The city of Amsterdam, where around 40% of all <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> by bicycle, adopted similar parking reduction policies in the 80s and 90s.|$|E

50|$|The next day, an {{additional}} round <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> {{added to the}} Los Angeles - San Diego corridor, supplementing the San Diegan. Branded as Metroliner, it made only two intermediate stops, cutting 15 minutes from the normal San Diegan schedule. The <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> discontinued on April 28, 1985.|$|R
25|$|Throughout {{the fall}} and leading into the spring, the Marching Band {{frequently}} performs at various venues, including football games, holidays, and community events. Various <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> performed throughout the year, including a bi-yearly appearance at Fiestaval.|$|E

25|$|On average, 930,000 <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> made on Metlink trains each month. In 2013-14, Tranz Metro claimed 94.3% punctuality, {{being the}} {{proportion}} of trains arriving within five minutes of schedule (94.7% punctuality if normalised {{for the effects of}} the 2013 Seddon earthquake and 2013 Lake Grassmere earthquake).|$|E
50|$|In 2000: An 8:15 pm <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> added.|$|R
50|$|The Fifth Circuit {{reversed}} in {{part and}} affirmed {{in part the}} lower court decision. The court found that the agenda was related primarily to business, {{the details of the}} <b>trip</b> <b>were</b> primarily controlled by Volkswagen, and that Mr. Gotcher's attendance was prompted by business considerations, primarily, to induce Mr. Gotcher to take interest in a Volkswagen dealership when Volkswagen was attempting to expand in the United States. Thus, the primary benefit of the <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> to Volkswagen as far as Mr. Gotcher was concerned, and thus the cost of <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> not income to him.|$|R
