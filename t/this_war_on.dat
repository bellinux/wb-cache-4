[...] He also raised questions about Obama’s middle name “Hussein,” reiterating similar comments in an Associated Press interview. ADC called for Congress to censure King.|$|E
2500|$|John Howe {{was born}} in 1754, {{the same year that}} the French and Indian War or Seven Years' War (1754–1763) began. [...] It was the {{consequences}} of this conflict that motivated the British to demand greater taxes from, and assert greater control over, their American colonies and it was the consequences of this conflict that raised and disappointed the English-American colonists' expectations about their opportunities for expansion, all of which contributed to the colonists' determination to revolt against an increasingly costly, authoritarian, and obstructive British rule. Howe was eight years old at the end of <b>this</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> September 7, 1763, so he grew to maturity influenced by the events that followed, such as colonial resistance to the Stamp Act (1765–66), when he was 11, and the violence of the Boston Massacre (1770), when he was 16, in which British troops opened fire on a mob of Bostonians who were brawling with the troops.|$|E

2500|$|On 16 September 2001, at Camp David, U.S. {{president}} George W. Bush {{used the}} phrase war on terrorism in an ostensibly unscripted comment when answering a journalist′s question {{about the impact of}} enhanced law enforcement authority given to the U.S. surveillance agencies on Americans′ civil liberties: [...] "This is a new kind of — a new kind of evil. [...] And we understand. [...] And the American people are beginning to understand. [...] This crusade, <b>this</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> terrorism {{is going to take a}} while. [...] And the American people must be patient. [...] I'm going to be patient." [...] Shortly after, the White House said the president regretted use of the term crusade, as it might have been misunderstood as reference to the historical Crusades; the word crusade was not used again. On 20 September 2001, during a televised address to a joint session of Congress, George Bush said, [...] "Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. [...] It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, {{as head of}} IDSA, Subrahmanyam was {{instrumental}} in helping compile {{some of the first}} authoritative reports on the war, in association with some of its key players. He would later write that the 1971 war saw the fledgling IDSA coming into its own as a well-regarded and influential think tank. Quite a bit of his commentary on the messy Cold War politics that shadowed the entire war – which included US moral support to Pakistan, its later dispatch of the USS Enterprise to the Bay of Bengal, and tacit Soviet support to India – [...] along with his related prescriptions for Indian foreign policy found their way into subsequent Indian military doctrine. He has since stated that the major lesson learnt from <b>this</b> <b>war,</b> <b>on</b> the administrative synergy required – where civilian leadership maintains close co-ordination with Intelligence and a pro-active rapport with military brass – has not been adequately enshrined as a guiding tenet of Indian security policy, which tends, in turn, to gravitate towards powerful political and bureaucratic interests.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{a series}} of {{military}} defeats, Igor Girkin, insurgent commander for the DPR, urged Russian military intervention, {{and said that the}} combat inexperience of his irregular forces, along with recruitment difficulties amongst the local population in Donetsk Oblast had caused the setbacks. He addressed Russian president Vladimir Putin, saying that [...] "Losing <b>this</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> the territory that President Vladimir Putin personally named New Russia would threaten the Kremlin's power and, personally, the power of the president". Government forces closed in on Luhansk and Donetsk cities on 3 August. A number of civilians were killed in fighting in both cities. Luhansk was reported to be [...] "virtually surrounded", with little electrical power or water supply available. The situation in the city of Donetsk was less dire, as trains to Russia were still running, but fighting and shelling did not relent. According to the Armed Forces, three-quarters of the territory once held by the insurgents had been recaptured. They also said that they had completely cut off supply lines between the DPR and LPR, after more than a week of fighting in Shakhtarsk Raion.|$|E

One can but marshal some of the more obvious and general liabilities and assets, and try to strike a balance. The whole thing is in flux. Millions are going into the crucible at every temperature; and who shall say at all precisely what will come out or what conditions the product issuing will meet with, though they obviously cannot be the same as before the war? For in considering this question, one must run into the account on either side not only the various effects of the war on the soldier-workman, but the altered influences his life will encounter in the future, so far as one can foresee; and this is all navigation in uncharted waters.|$|E

6000|$|In those admirable pieces {{does his}} Majesty {{discover}} this new opinion {{of his political}} security, in having {{the chair of the}} scorner, that is, the discipline of atheism, and the block of regicide, set up by his side, elevated on the same platform, and shouldering, with the vile image of their grim and bloody idol, the inviolable majesty of his throne? The sentiments of these declarations are the very reverse: they could not be other. Speaking of the spirit of that usurpation, the royal manifesto describes, with perfect truth, its internal tyranny to have been established as the very means of shaking the security of all other states,--as [...] "disposing arbitrarily of the property and blood of the inhabitants of France, in order to disturb the tranquillity of other nations, and to render all Europe the theatre of the same crimes and of the same misfortunes." [...] It was but a natural inference from this fact, that the royal manifesto does not at all rest the justification of <b>this</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> common principles: that it was [...] "not only to defend his own rights, and those of his allies," [...] but [...] "that all the dearest interests of his people imposed upon him a duty still more important,--that of exerting his efforts for the preservation of civil society itself, as happily established among the nations of Europe." [...] On that ground, the protection offered is to [...] "those who, by declaring for a monarchical government, shall shake off the yoke of a sanguinary anarchy." [...] It is for that purpose the declaration calls on them [...] "to join the standard of an hereditary monarchy,"--declaring that the peace and safety of this kingdom and the other powers of Europe [...] "materially depend on the reëstablishment of order in France." [...] His Majesty does not hesitate to declare that [...] "the reëstablishment of monarchy, in the person of Louis the Seventeenth, and the lawful heirs of the crown, appears to him [his Majesty] the best mode of accomplishing these just and salutary views." ...|$|E
