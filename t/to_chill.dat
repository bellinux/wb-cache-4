5|$|The ice trade revolutionised the {{way that}} food was {{preserved}} and transported. Before the 19th century, preservation had depended upon techniques such as curing or smoking, but large supplies of natural ice allowed foods to be refrigerated or frozen instead. Although using ice <b>to</b> <b>chill</b> foods was a relatively simple process, it required considerable experimentation to produce efficient and reliable methods for controlling the flow of warm and cold air in different containers and transport systems. In {{the early stages of}} the ice trade there was also a tension between preserving the limited supply of ice, by limiting the flow of air over it, and preserving the food, which depended on circulating more air over the ice to create colder temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The ice trade {{enabled the}} {{consumption}} {{of a wide range}} of new products during the 19th century. One simple use for natural ice was <b>to</b> <b>chill</b> drinks, either being directly added to the glass or barrel, or indirectly chilling it in a wine cooler or similar container. Iced drinks were a novelty and were initially viewed with concern by customers, worried about the health risks, although this rapidly vanished in the US. By mid-19th century, water was always chilled in America if possible. Iced milk also popular, and German lager, traditionally drunk chilled, also used ice. Drinks such as sherry-cobblers and mint juleps were created that could only be made using crushed ice. There were distinct differences in 19th-century American and European attitudes to adding ice directly to drinks, with the Europeans regarding this as an unpleasant habit; British visitors to India were surprised to see the Anglo-Indian elite prepared to drink iced water. Some Hindus in India regarded ice as unclean for religious reasons, and as such an inappropriate food.|$|E

25|$|Wine {{refrigerators}} offer {{a smaller}} alternative to wine cellars {{and are available}} in capacities ranging from small, 16-bottle units to furniture-quality pieces that can contain 400 bottles. Wine refrigerators are not ideal for aging, but rather serve <b>to</b> <b>chill</b> wine to the proper temperature for drinking. These refrigerators keep the humidity low (usually under 50%), below the optimal humidity of 50% to 70%. Lower humidity levels can dry out corks over time, allowing oxygen to enter the bottle, which reduces the wine's quality through oxidation. While some types of alcohol are sometimes stored in freezer, such as vodka, {{it is not possible}} to safely freeze wine in the bottle, as there is insufficient room for it to expand as it freezes and the bottle will usually crack. Certain shapes of bottle may allow the cork to be pushed out by the ice, but if the bottle is frozen on its side, the wine in the narrower neck will invariably freeze first, preventing this.|$|E

500|$|Some {{techniques}} were also invented to produce ice or chilled drinks through more artificial means. In India, ice was {{imported from the}} Himalayas in the 17th century, but the expense of this meant that by the 19th century ice was instead manufactured in small quantities during the winter further south. Porous clay pots containing boiled, cooled water were laid out on top of straw in shallow trenches; under favourable circumstances, thin ice would form on the surface during winter nights which could be harvested and combined for sale. There were production sites at Hugli-Chuchura and Allahabad, but this [...] "hoogly ice" [...] was only available in limited amounts and considered of poor quality because it often resembled soft slush rather than hard crystals. Saltpeter and water were mixed together in India to cool drinks, taking advantage of local supplies of the chemical. In Europe, various chemical means for cooling drinks were created by the 19th century; these typically used sulphuric acid <b>to</b> <b>chill</b> the liquid, but were not capable of producing actual ice.|$|E

After the incident he couldn't wait to get back home to the village."He then stated that he wanted viewers to learn from his character's scenario and be responsible while drinking, stating: [...] "It will make people think twice about binge drinking and make people aware of the consequences if you do." [...] When the character lost his teeth it made the character's low confidence worsen, Quinlan made comment of this saying: [...] "Gilly's confidence was always low really - self-confidence, self-belief. But having no teeth isn't good to look at - not a good look. It's going to draw attention to him and not do him any favours."

To elucidate the molecular genetic mechanisms of chilling tolerance in rice, comprehensive gene expressions of two rice genotypes (chilling-tolerant LTH and chilling-sensitive IR 29) with contrasting responses <b>to</b> <b>chilling</b> stress were comparatively analyzed. Results revealed a differential constitutive gene expression prior to stress and distinct global transcription reprogramming between the two rice genotypes under time-series chilling stress and subsequent recovery conditions. A set of genes with higher basal expression were identified in chilling-tolerant LTH compared with chilling-sensitive IR 29, indicating their possible role in intrinsic tolerance <b>to</b> <b>chilling</b> stress. Under chilling stress, the major effect on gene expression was up-regulation in the chilling- tolerant genotype and strong repression in chilling-sensitive genotype.
