For example, the assemblies theoretically held all power, but were called and governed by the magistrates, who, controlling discussion, exercised dominating influence over them. Similarly, to check <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magistrates, each magistrate could veto one of their colleagues and the plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and veto the actions of a magistrate.|$|E

This power of light would have consumed the world itself had the light crystals not had their natural counterparts: the four dark elemental crystals. Disturbed by the sudden interruption of the careful balance between light and dark, four warriors were granted <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark crystals to recapture <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light crystals. These so-called Dark Warriors succeeded in their quest, and restored harmony to the world.
