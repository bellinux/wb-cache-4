5|$|The central {{chimney stack}} exists, but the {{back-to-back}} fireplaces have been blocked. The staircase may have originally been located {{to one side}} of the back-to-back fireplaces, but no evidence of this remains. There are two rooms on the upstairs floor, the southern one having been partitioned, plus an additional two rooms in the attic complete with modern fittings. The first floor and attic was used as a flat, with a kitchen, living room and office on the first floor, and <b>two</b> <b>bedrooms</b> in the attic. The roof is thought to be from around 1800 but has subsequently been strengthened.|$|E
5|$|The main portion (the center) {{contains}} the entrance, facing west. To its {{left is the}} chapel and to its right is the schoolroom. Both rooms originally were smaller, with bedrooms located {{at the ends of}} building, but a 1910 restoration eliminated those walls to enlarge the rooms. <b>Two</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> a living room, a kitchen (which was added at a later date), and the servants' dining room are in the north wing, while the south wing has three bedrooms and the family dining room. The house is topped by a cupola from which bullfights and festivals in the adjacent plaza could be seen.|$|E
5|$|The {{suite of}} state {{rooms on the}} first floor of the east wing {{contains}} the long gallery, library, drawing room (great chamber), small drawing room and <b>two</b> <b>bedrooms.</b> All date originally from the Jacobean mansion, but are likely to have been significantly altered by John Crewe and then extensively reworked by Blore in neo-Jacobean style. They were restored to Barry's designs, usually with little attempt to reproduce the Jacobean appearance, probably because records of most of the original designs were lacking. Crace performed much of the decoration work in these rooms. All the state rooms contain elaborate plasterwork and stone chimneypieces, often flanked with Corinthian columns or pilasters.|$|E

5|$|The Winslow Ames House is a {{prefabricated}} modular International Style {{house in}} New London, Connecticut, United States. It {{was designed by}} Robert W. McLaughlin, Jr. and was built in 1933. Winslow Ames, a professor of art history at Connecticut College and the art director of the Lyman Allyn Museum, had the home built after attending the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. Constructed for $7,500, the prefabricated house {{is one of two}} surviving Motohomes produced by McLaughlin's company American Houses Inc. The modular house, comprising three rectangles and a flat roof, was constructed on a concrete slab with a welded steel framework. It was made with asbestos panels and features a core component that provides the heating and plumbing functions for the house. The other two modules feature <b>two</b> <b>bedrooms</b> and a one-car garage.|$|E
5|$|Charles A. Dibble (born 1836 in Saratoga County, New York), {{by various}} {{accounts}} a railroad man, livery stable owner, and Civil War veteran, lived in Eldon {{in the late}} nineteenth century. He and his wife, Catharine, began building the house in 1881 for themselves and their eight children. Its relatively simple board-and-batten siding, white color, and moderate size—just —were quite common in nineteenth century Iowa architecture. A similar style can be observed in the birthplace of President Herbert Hoover in West Branch, built a decade before the American Gothic House, which features board-and-batten siding, a simple shingled roof, a central chimney, white color, and a moderate size as well. Unique and unusual exterior features of the house include its two Gothic windows in the gable and its steep-pitched roof. Both features would later be exaggerated by Grant Wood in American Gothic. The lower floor of the house contains three rooms and a bathroom, while the upper floor has <b>two</b> <b>bedrooms.</b> The house has been called the best-known example of a Carpenter Gothic cottage in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Inmates {{are allowed}} to receive their families, partners, or friends privately twice a week for two hours. Individual rooms {{containing}} a sofa, sink, and cupboard with sheets, towels, and condoms are available for single-person visits. For those with families, a larger room with toys and baby-changing facilities is available. Inmates are checked after visits, and if illegal items are found, prisoners can lose their rights to private visits. This right is denied to high risk criminals and visitors with histories of drug offenses. There is also a separated, chalet-style house where prisoners can receive visits from family members and stay with them for 24 hours. The house has a small kitchen, <b>two</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> a bathroom, a living room with a dining table, a sofa, and a television, {{as well as an}} outdoor play area with toys. Foreigners are not allowed and inmates have to complete a child-development education program to have 24-hour-long visits. During visits, staff make regular checks on the prisoners and their families.|$|E

5|$|For the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{only the}} {{interior}} {{of one of the}} four units was surveyed, the second floor interior of 341 Broadway. This unit is accessed from a spiral staircase leading from the first floor to the attic. The second floor landing has a short foyer before opening to two parlors. The front parlor is said to have had a water fountain which was removed, but the plumbing is said to exist within the floor. The back parlor has a Queen Anne mantel and leads to the dining room with large floor-to-ceiling china closets. Located {{on the east side of}} the apartment is the kitchen, pantry and rear staircase. The north part of the apartment contains <b>two</b> <b>bedrooms</b> and a bath. The NRHP nomination states that the alterations to the unit were minimal and it is likely that the same would have been done for the first floor unit. The northern Fuller House, containing 343-345 Broadway, has been more seriously modified because it has been split into four units. In 2013, real estate information for 343 Broadway suggests the expanse of the modifications to the house by listing the property as having 20 rooms, with 8 bedrooms and 5 baths. According to Trulia the house was sold in 2010 for $140,000 and still in the four unit configuration. A three-bay stuccoed garage dating from the 1920s or 1930 is used by 339-341 Broadway.|$|E
5|$|The central {{range was}} begun around 1500, {{possibly}} as a two-storey building containing a great hall, although only fragments {{of this building}} remain. The south entrance to the tower house was blocked up, and replaced with a ground floor entrance from the east. A new stair tower, with a broad spiral stair, was built at the south-east corner. Originally topped by a conical roof, this stair gave access to the upper floors in the tower, and to the central range. Around 1570, the 4th Earl of Morton rebuilt the block, extending it further south to form new apartments. This block, forming the present three-storey central range, includes a vaulted kitchen and cellar in the basement, with suites of rooms above. The <b>two</b> <b>bedrooms</b> {{on the first floor}} each have their own closets and garderobes, or privies. The west apartment is accessed from the terraced garden, via another stair to the south-west, and has a private stair which led up to another chamber above, suggesting that these were the Earl and Countesses apartments. The upper storey, whose timber floor is now missing, comprised three more apartments, including one over the stair. The exterior of the block is decorated with a horizontal decorative strip of masonry known as a string course. One first-floor window is decorated with carved stone pilasters and strapwork, in a similar style to windows at Edinburgh Castle and Drochil Castle, in the Borders, both of which were built under Morton's Regency.|$|E
25|$|In Russia, {{the term}} suburb refers to {{high-rise}} residential apartments which usually consist of <b>two</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> one bathroom, a kitchen and a living room. These suburbs, however {{are usually not}} in poor neighborhoods, unlike the banlieuees.|$|E
