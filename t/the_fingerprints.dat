5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In the episode, Isaac Luria (Harrison Coe), a Jewish man, is killed {{by a group of}} {{teenagers}} working for a racist shop owner. One of the assailants, however, is soon strangled to death and <b>the</b> <b>fingerprints</b> on his neck are Isaac's. Despite other factors, Mulder becomes convinced that a Golem is attempting to avenge Isaac's murder.|$|E
5|$|While {{reviewing}} the O'Dell case, Veronica notices that the TV station the dean {{was watching the}} night he was murdered had moved its programming back an hour, meaning their estimated time of death was wrong. The forensic results about the prints in O'Dell’s room come back, and they are <b>the</b> <b>fingerprints</b> of Steve Botando (Richard Grieco). Steve Botando is investigated by Sheriff Lamb.|$|E
5|$|As he {{continues}} his investigations, Craven is visited by Emma's ghost. <b>The</b> <b>fingerprints</b> on the getaway car used by Emma's killer match that of Lowe, a man Craven arrested ten years previously. Meanwhile, Pendleton takes Craven {{to meet his}} colleague, Harcourt (Ian McNeice), who informs him that Emma {{was a member of}} a subversive anti-nuclear group called GAIA. A team of six GAIA members, led by Emma, had broken into a low level radioactive waste facility at Northmoor; all are now either dead or missing. After Craven makes a televised appeal for information about Emma's killer, he is contacted by CIA agent Darius Jedburgh (Joe Don Baker), an associate of Harcourt and Pendleton. Jedburgh shows Craven the CIA's file on Emma's activities: GAIA had become suspicious of Northmoor when a nearby reservoir had become contaminated with radioactive material, an occurrence that had also alerted the CIA, leading them to believe Northmoor was illegally storing plutonium. Jedburgh is played as a hard-bitten professional with a wry sense of humour and a passion for ballroom dancing. Along with Harcourt and Pendleton, he is keen to find the source and purpose of the plutonium.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>fingerprint</b> {{recognition}} {{problem can}} be grouped into two sub-domains: one is <b>fingerprint</b> verification and <b>the</b> other is <b>fingerprint</b> identification. In addition, different from the manual approach for fingerprint recognition by experts, <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> recognition here is referred as Fingerprint Recognition System, which is program-based. Fingerprint verification is to verify the authenticity of one person by his <b>fingerprint.</b> <b>The</b> user provides his fingerprint together with his identity information like his ID number. <b>The</b> <b>fingerprint</b> verification system retrieves <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> template according to the ID number and matches the template with <b>the</b> real-time acquired <b>fingerprint</b> from <b>the</b> user.

5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an unknown person {{lighting}} a candle in the homicide squadroom. One by one, the detectives arrive for the night shift on an unusually hot September evening. A furious Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calls maintenance {{to complain about the}} non-working air conditioner and learns it has been shut off for the night. Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) try to find out who secretly lights the candle every night; they blow it out a number of times, but it always ends up lit again without anyone noticing. Munch (Richard Belzer) loudly complains about his ex-girlfriend breaking up with him. While the other detectives sweat and complain about the heat, a calm and comfortable Pembleton (Andre Braugher) wears a tie and drinks hot tea without sweating. Bayliss (Kyle Secor), who acts uncooperative with his partner Pembleton, says he has found <b>the</b> <b>fingerprints</b> of a man named James Hill who he believes is the murderer in the Adena Watson case. Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) brings in Hill, who {{turns out to be a}} 12-year-old boy (Kenny Blank), much to the amusement of the other detectives.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the next}} {{two and a half}} hours, Cho {{returned}} to his room to rearm himself; he mailed a package to NBC News that contained pictures, digital video files and documents. At approximately 9:45a.m. EDT (13:45 UTC), he then crossed the campus to Norris Hall, a classroom building on the campus where, in a span of nine minutes, Cho shot dozens of people, killing 30 of them. As police breached the area of the building where Cho attacked the faculty and students, Cho committed suicide in Norris 211 with a gunshot to his temple. Cho's gunshot wound destroyed his face, obscuring identification of his body for several hours. The police identified Cho by matching <b>the</b> <b>fingerprints</b> on the guns used in the shootings with immigration records. Before the shootings, Cho's only known connection to Norris Hall was as a student in the sociology class, which met in a classroom {{on the second floor of}} the building. Although police had not stated positively at the time of the initial investigation that Cho was the perpetrator of the Norris Hall shootings and the earlier one at West Ambler Johnston Hall, forensic evidence confirmed that the same gun was used in both shooting incidents.|$|E
25|$|Fingerprints are voluntarily {{submitted}} to the FBI by local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. These agencies acquire <b>the</b> <b>fingerprints</b> through criminal arrests or from non-criminal sources, such as employment background checks and the US-VISIT program. The FBI then catalogs <b>the</b> <b>fingerprints</b> along with any criminal history linked with the subject.|$|E
50|$|The {{second part}} of the {{infrared}} spectrum is called <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> region; it is associated with types of motion allowed by the symmetry of the molecule and influenced by the bond energies. <b>The</b> <b>fingerprint</b> region is more specific to an individual compound.

50|$|Powders may {{be applied}} with a {{fingerprint}} brush, a brush with extremely fine fibers {{designed to hold}} powder, and deposit it gently on <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> to be revealed, without rubbing away the often delicate residue of <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> itself. They may also be applied by blowing the powder across <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint,</b> or by pouring the powder onto the print, and then blowing away the excess.|$|R
30|$|A {{configuration}} with fields PU or PR {{presented the}} best performance since no cryptographic operations is need to generate <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint,</b> followed by configurations CO and CD. Although more time is necessary to process <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> for CD when compared to CO (Table  2), this fact does not impact its performance since it demands less than a millisecond to execute (0.033 ms). The configuration OP also presented an acceptable performance, although more time is necessary to process <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, the configuration OR presented poor performance since {{a lot of time}} was necessary to process <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the United States, the FBI {{manages a}} {{fingerprint}} identification system and database called the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), which currently holds <b>the</b> <b>fingerprints</b> and criminal records of over 51 million criminal record subjects and over 1.5 million civil (non-criminal) fingerprint records. US Visit currently holds {{a repository of}} <b>the</b> <b>fingerprints</b> of over 50 million people, primarily {{in the form of}} two-finger records. In 2008, US Visit hoped to have changed over to a system recording FBI-standard ten-print records.|$|E

He attached <b>the</b> <b>fingerprints</b> to evidence cards and later claimed that he had pulled <b>the</b> <b>fingerprints</b> {{from the scene of}} the murder. The forged evidence was presented during John Spencer's trial and his subsequent conviction resulted in a term of 50 years to life in prison at his sentencing.

30|$|Now, we will {{consider}} a slight variation of the extractor algorithm, which we call pre-extractor. This algorithm, instead of returning exactly <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> (previously embedded by the embedder algorithm), returns a sequence of bits—possibly a long one—that contains <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> as a substring. More precisely, the substring will be, as we have seen, the product of two prime numbers, one of them having <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> as a prefix.|$|R
25|$|On August 23, 1995, the BPD {{became the}} first police agency to send {{fingerprint}} images to the FBI electronically using the newly created EFIPS (now IAFIS) system.

40|$|Fingerprint {{residues}} {{are analyzed}} using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, GC/MS, to identify oxidation states and chemical compositions of components in <b>the</b> prints. <b>Fingerprint</b> samples are collected on glass, metal, wood and plastic, and stored under {{two sets of}} conditions. Extractions of <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> material are performed the day of sample collection, and 1, 2, 7, 14 and 28 days after collection. The extractions are derivatized to make the compounds volatile. The volatiles are separated and identified via GC-MS. The first hypothesis is that components in <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> react in air to form different compounds, and these differences can be quantified to indicate how long the print was exposed to air. Differences in storage of <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> may also affect the oxidation products formed. A second hypothesis is that the substrate on which <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> was made affects {{the products of the}} air oxidation and may interact with <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> compounds to present a different set of products altogether...|$|R

40|$|It is an {{effective}} method to improve {{the security of the}} identity authentication system by making use of information hiding technology, which integrates user identity information in <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint,</b> face and password with multi-mode authentication to increase authentication security. Password information embedded into <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> images to hide and store the password information, which not only meet the needs of safety certification, but also ensure the safety performance of password storage. This article firstly describes the password information hiding technology that is with fingerprint image as carrier. And then we divided <b>the</b> refined <b>fingerprint</b> images by <b>the</b> pixels cell block, and then mapped the password information to the pixels of the cell center with the hash function, which is equivalent to constitute a binary sparse matrix. This method not only guarantees the quality of <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> image, but also ensures the quality of <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> image skeleton ridge line, to ensure <b>the</b> accuracy of <b>fingerprint</b> identification. Finally, with the experimental results, the information hiding technique based on fingerprint boundary of single pixel proposed in this paper can well embedded information into <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> images,which has lower modified ratio {{and at the same time}} proves PSNR.

40|$|The de-noising of <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> {{image is}} one of the key tasks before the {{extraction}} of the minutiae in automatic finger-print matching.

To address this problem, we propose a local orientation field based nonlo-cal means (NLM-LOF) method in this paper. Experimental results on the simulated and real images show that the pro-posed method can suppress noise effectively while preserving edges and details in <b>the</b> <b>fingerprint</b> image and it outper-forms the state-of-art nonlocal means method in terms of qualitative metrics and visual comparisons...|$|R
