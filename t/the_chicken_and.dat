5|$|Animals such as {{the fruit}} fly Drosophila melanogaster, the zebrafish, <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>and</b> the house mouse, serve {{a major role in}} science as {{experimental}} models, both in fundamental biological research, such as in genetics, and in the development of new medicines, which must be tested exhaustively to demonstrate their safety. Millions of mammals, especially mice and rats, are used in experiments each year.|$|E
25|$|Slow-simmered stews {{with various}} {{ingredients}} are another common food staple in Ivory Coast. Kedjenou is a dish consisting of chicken and vegetables that are slow-cooked {{in a sealed}} pot {{with little or no}} added liquid, which concentrates the flavors of <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>and</b> vegetables and tenderizes the chicken. It is usually cooked in a pottery jar called a canary, over a slight fire, or cooked in an oven. Bangui is a local palm wine.|$|E

She stated she was unable to leave the house to inform Purvis or Martin about Dillinger's plans to attend the Biograph, but as they were going to have fried chicken for the evening meal, she told Polly she had nothing in which to fry <b>the</b> <b>chicken,</b> <b>and</b> was going to the store to get some butter; that while at the store she called Mr. Purvis and {{informed}} him of Dillinger's plans to attend the Biograph that evening, at the same time obtaining the butter. She then returned to the house so Polly would not be suspicious that she went out to call anyone.|$|E
25|$|Several early German and French {{scholars}} compiled old {{works and}} conducted new research on birds. These included Guillaume Rondelet who described his observations in the Mediterranean and Pierre Belon who described {{the fish and}} birds {{that he had seen}} in France and the Levant. Belon's Book of Birds (1555) is a folio volume with descriptions of some two hundred species. His comparison of the skeleton of humans and birds is considered as a landmark in comparative anatomy. Volcher Coiter (1534–1576), a Dutch anatomist made detailed studies of the internal structures of birds and produced a classification of birds, De Differentiis Avium (around 1572), that was based on structure and habits. Konrad Gesner wrote the Vogelbuch and Icones avium omnium around 1557. Like Gesner, Ulisse Aldrovandi, an encyclopedic naturalist began a 14-volume natural history with three volumes on birds, entitled ornithologiae hoc est de avibus historiae libri XII which was published from 1599 to 1603. Aldrovandi showed great interest in plants and animals and his work included 3000 drawings of fruits, flowers, plants and animals, published in 363 volumes. His Ornithology alone covers 2000 pages and included such aspects as <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>and</b> poultry techniques. He used a number of traits including behaviour, particularly bathing and dusting, to classify bird groups.|$|E
500|$|After the {{financial}} Panic of 1837, Johnson took a nine-month leave of absence, {{during which he}} returned home to Kentucky and opened a tavern and spa on his farm to offset his continued financial problems.

500|$|There {{are four}} main {{animatronics}} {{in the first}} game: Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny (referred to as [...] "Bonnie the Rabbit" [...] in copyright catalogs), Chica <b>the</b> <b>Chicken,</b> <b>and</b> Foxy the Pirate Fox. A fifth animatronic, Golden Freddy, occasionally appears, albeit {{in the form of}} a hallucination. His jumpscare is capable of crashing the game. The animatronics return in various forms throughout the following games, except in the fifth installment, in which Chica is completely absent.|$|E
500|$|As a subplot, Stan {{spends most}} of the episode trying to return the {{aforementioned}} Margaritaville mixer; the trendy retailer Sur La Table will not accept the return because it was bought on a payment plan. He tries to find out to whom he can return it, each person saying the debt has been packaged and sold to someone else (much like real-life mortgage-backed securities). Eventually he {{goes all the way}} to the United States Treasury, where a group of associates [...] "consult the charts" [...] and tell him the mixer is worth $90 trillion. One of the three treasury workers then says that another insurance company is failing and asks what they should do. They say they have to [...] "consult the charts" [...] again. Stan follows the men inside, and he sees a round lit-up game show style board, where the men cut off a chicken's head and let the decapitated chicken run on the board while one of them plays a tune similar to Yakety Sax on a kazoo. The chicken falls on the [...] "bailout!" [...] spot, so that is what the men do. In anger at the ridiculousness of the system, Stan breaks the mixer on the platform by <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>and</b> walks off.|$|E

He explains that the restaurant's animatronic animal characters, Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica <b>the</b> <b>Chicken,</b> <b>and</b> the disused Foxy the Pirate Fox, come to life at night, because if they were left off for too long, their servomotors would lock up. The employee warns Mike that if one of the robots encounters a human, they will automatically assume that it is an endoskeleton not in a costume, and [...] "forcefully stuff them" [...] into a spare mechanical Freddy Fazbear costume, killing the person in the process.|$|E
