An adaptive mesh is applied to analyze two-dimension elastoplastic fracture during crack propagation. Displacement control approach and updated Lagrangean strategy are used to solve the non-linearity In geometry, material and boundary for plane stress crack problem. In the finite element analysis, the remeshing process is based on stress error norm coupled with h-version mesh refinement to find an optimal mesh. The crack is modeled by splitting crack <b>tip</b> <b>node</b> and automatic remeshing calculated for each step of crack growth. Crack has been modeled to propagate through the inter-element in the mesh. The crack is free to propagates without predetermine path direction.

By comparing Figs.  4  and  5 a, the effect of the mesh refitting procedure is clear: the new <b>tip</b> <b>nodes</b> are first moved to the desired location using the nodal repositioning step, and then the Quad element is appropriately split into Tri elements to enable crack propagation along the diagonal. In short, the combination of nodal repositioning and element splitting ensure that after the mesh modifications, the crack propagates along an existing edge in the new mesh.|$|R

In the new element, all possible contacts on the crack edge are considered by remeshing method, when the crack is closing under all possible changing loads. The fatigue crack initiates when the fatigue damage exceeds certain critical damage value, and fatigue crack propagation are simulated by gradual seeking crack propagating directions and new crack tips, using a remeshing method that a damaged node at the crack tip {{is replaced by a}} pair of nodes, a new crack <b>tip</b> <b>node</b> is assigned at the crack propagating directions and a more pair of nodes are needed to be added on the crack edge near the crack tip in order to better facilitate the free-traction boundary condition.

30|$|In {{the initial}} state of propagation, the {{position}} of the crack is predefined Γ _c^ 0; the mesh M is properly generated, once and for all, without any change on it during the process of growth. Then, the relative position of the crack is implicitly identified by level-set functions, leaving aside its known Cartesian global position. Consequently, crack is recognized independently of the mesh definition, relatively, with respect to its nodal environment thanks to the signed-distance function. At this early stage, to write the discrete XFEM form of the displacement, Eq. (14), and the temperature, Eq. (16), fields, we ought to select the two kinds of enriched nodes families, Heaviside and <b>tip</b> enriched <b>nodes.</b> All the mesh nodes including those wholly enriched are roughly approximated by the standard shape functions. The nodes enriched by Heaviside function are described by the nodes forming the elements thoroughly crossed by the crack. The <b>tip</b> candidate <b>nodes</b> are such as those <b>nodes</b> composing the <b>tip</b> element for a topological enrichment; in geometrical enrichment on a given disk, D of radius R and centered on the tip, the discrete set of <b>tip</b> <b>nodes</b> is formed by the intersection of the mesh M and the disk D, M∩D. In geometrical enrichment instance, D crosses undoubtedly, for a large radius, the already selected Heaviside nodes. As a result, these nodes should be enriched simultaneously by the combined form of branching function and Heaviside, F+H. This selection configuration is performed for the initial increment and will identify the enriched-zone EZ^ 0 related to {{the position of}} the crack Γ _c^ 0 which is supposed to be unique. At the next increment, the same procedure is followed until a (k - 1)th incremental crack is reached, Γ _c^k- 1. At the kth increment, we suppose that the chosen crack growth criterion is satisfied, which allows extending the crack in the appropriate direction. This progress creates a new geometrical configuration of the crack and a new enriched-zone EZ^k to be identified. We proceed in the same way, by recurrence, as the (k - 1)th increment. This time we find ourselves with two different configurations where some nodes in the previous increment that they were, for example, of Heaviside type become <b>tip</b> <b>nodes,</b> or standard nodes convert to Heaviside/tip nodes, or vice versa. The transport of nodal fields corresponding to temperature and displacements computed at the (k - 1)th increment to the kth one will be performed by an L^ 2 -projection on the discrete space generated by the kth recent configuration by means of least squares method. This strategy is possible since the different quantities are square-integrable, which allows ensuring the stability and efficiency of the used scheme. To note that, the advancement of the crack generates a new geometrical, topological and numerical reality of the thermo-mechanical problem resolution which requires a specific treatment at each increment. This results in an extensible and flexible set of degrees of freedom with the crack evolution; therefore, the linear system of discrete equations is also extensible and changes in dimension depending on the crack growth state, it can enlarge or diminish. On the other hand, the selection rule of the EZ^k nodes is independent of the previous configuration and related only to the relative position of the crack in its nodal environment at the actual increment. We are thus left with two different configurations of two successive increments. This process is repeated iteratively until the estimated or evaluated end of the propagation process.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} partial order game tree search arises from game playing {{situations}} where multiple, conflicting and non-commensurate criteria dictate {{the merit of}} a position of the game. In partial order game trees, the outcomes evaluated at the <b>tip</b> <b>nodes</b> are vectors, where each dimension of the vector represents a distinct criterion of merit. This leads to an interesting variant of the game tree searching problem where corresponding to every game playing strategy of a player, several outcomes are possible depending on the individual priorities of the opponent. In this paper, we identify the necessary and sufficient conditions {{for a set of}} outcomes to be inferior to another set of outcomes for every strategy. Using an algebra called Dominance Algebra on sets of outcomes, we describe a bottom-up approach to find the non-inferior sets of outcomes at the root node.

30|$|We {{devise a}} finite element {{methodology}} to trace quasi-static through-thickness crack paths in nonlinear elastic solids. The main {{feature of the}} proposed method {{is that it can}} be directly implemented into existing large scale finite element solvers with minimal effort. The mesh topology modifications that are essential in propagating a crack through the finite element mesh are accomplished by utilizing a combination of a mesh refitting procedure and a nodal releasing approach. The mesh refitting procedure consists of two steps: in the first step, the nodes are moved by solving the elastostatic equations without touching the connectivity between the elements; in the next step, if necessary, quadrilateral elements attached to crack <b>tip</b> <b>nodes</b> are split into triangular elements. This splitting of elements allows the straightforward modification of element connectivity locally, and is a key step to preserve the quality of the mesh throughout the simulation. All the geometry related operations required for crack propagation are addressed in detail with full emphasis on computer implementation. Solving several examples involving single and multiple cracks, and comparing them with experimental or other numerical approaches indicate that the proposed method captures crack paths accurately.|$|R

40|$|Background: Neotropical lizards, genus Anolis (Polychrotidae), {{with nearly}} 380 species, {{are members of}} one of the most diversified genera among amniotes. Herein, we present an {{overview}} of chromosomal evolution in 'beta' Anolis (Norops group) as a baseline for future studies of the karyotypic evolution of anoles. We evaluated all available information concerning karyotypes of Norops, including original data on a recently described species, Anolis unilobatus. We used the phylogeny of Norops based on DNA sequence data to infer the main pattern of chromosomal evolution by means of an ancestral state analysis (ASR). Results: We identified 11 different karyotypes, of which 9 in the species had so far been used in molecular studies. The ASR indicated that a change in the number of microchromosomes was the first evolutionary step, followed by an increase in chromosome numbers, likely due to centric fissions of macrochromosomes. The ASR also showed that in nine species, heteromorphic sex chromosomes most probably originated from six independent events. Conclusions: We observed an overall good correspondence of some characteristics of karyotypes and species relationships. Moreover, the clade seems prone to sex chromosome diversification, and the origins of five of these heteromorphic sex chromosome variants seem to be recent as they appear at the <b>tip</b> <b>nodes</b> in the ancestral character reconstruction.

Here we use species-level phylogenies based on ≈ 1300 base pairs of the genes 16 S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase I to establish the relationships of 27 of the 34 endemic Iberian species of diving beetles in the family Dytiscidae, and to investigate their level of divergence. Using a molecular clock approach, 18 – 19 of these species were estimated to be of Pleistocene origin, with four to six of them from the Late Pleistocene (≈ 100 000 years). A second, lower speciation frequency peak was assigned to Late Miocene or Early Pliocene. Analysis of the distributional ranges showed that endemic species placed in the <b>tip</b> <b>nodes</b> of the trees are significantly more likely to be allopatric with their sisters than endemic species at lower node levels. Allopatric sister species are also significantly younger than sympatric clades, in agreement with an allopatric mode of speciation and limited subsequent range movement. These results strongly suggest that for some taxa Iberian populations were isolated during the Pleistocene long enough to spe-ciate, and apparently did not expand their ranges to recolonize areas north of the Pyrenees. This is in contradiction to observations from fossil beetles in areas further north, which document large range movements associated with the Pleistocene glacial cycles hypothe-sized to suppress population isolation and allopatric speciation...|$|R

Effects of sowing medium, auxin concentration, storage temperature and planting substrate on shoot regrowth or conversion into plantlets were assessed for four different clones. High frequencies of shoot regrowth (76 – 100 %) from encapsulated explants were consistently obtained in hormone-free half- and full-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) sowing media. Conversion into plantlets from synthetic seeds was achieved on half-strength MS medium by treating shoot <b>tips</b> or <b>nodes</b> with 4. 9 – 78. 4 μM IBA prior to encapsulation. Pre-treatment with 19. 6 μM IBA provided 62 – 100 % conversion, and 95 – 100 % of plantlets survived after acclimatisation under nursery conditions. Synthetic seeds containing explants pre-treated with IBA were stored for 8 weeks much more effectively at 25 °C than at 4 °C, with regrowth frequencies of 50 – 84 % at 25 °C compared with 0 – 4 % at 4 °C. To eliminate the in vitro culture step after encapsulation, synthetic seeds were allowed to pre-convert before sowing directly onto a range of ex vitro non-sterile planting substrates. Highest frequencies (46 – 90 %) of plantlet formation from pre-converted synthetic seeds were obtained by transferring shoot tip-derived synthetic seeds onto an organic compost substrate.
