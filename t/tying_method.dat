40|$|The {{coordination}} {{structures of}} vanadium and iron introduced into MCM- 41, a typical mesoporous silica, by both direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (<b>TIE)</b> <b>methods</b> {{have been studied}} by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS). Vanadium is tetrahedrally coordinated with oxygen in V-MCM- 41 prepared by both methods but the location of vanadium is probably different; vanadium is mainly incorporated inside the framework of MCM- 41 by the DHT method as the content is lower than approximately 1 wt%, while the vanadyl tetrahedra are probably dispersed on the wall surface, of MCM- 41 over the samples by the <b>TIE</b> <b>method.</b> In the case of Fe-MCM- 41, the DHT method results in iron atoms mainly in tetrahedral coordination and isolated {{from each other in}} the framework of MCM- 41. However, aggregated iron oxides with iron in octahedral coordination are mainly observed in the TIE samples. The V-MCM- 41 by the <b>TIE</b> <b>method</b> shows better catalytic performances that by the DHT method in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde with oxygen. However, the Fe-MCM- 41 by the DHT method exhibits remarkably higher methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity than that by the <b>TIE</b> <b>method.</b> (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the finite}} element method, a {{standard}} approach to mesh tying {{is to apply}} Lagrange multipliers. If the interface is curved, however, discretization generally leads to adjoining surfaces that do not coincide spatially. Straightforward Lagrange multiplier methods lead to discrete formulations failing a first-order patch test [12]. A least-squares method is presented here for mesh tying {{in the presence of}} gaps and overlaps. The least-squares formulation for transmission problems [5] is extended to settings where subdomain boundaries are not spatially coincident. The new method is consistent {{in the sense that it}} recovers exactly global polynomial solutions that are in the finite element space. As a result, the least-squares mesh <b>tying</b> <b>method</b> passes a patch test of the order of the finite element space by construction. This attractive computational property is illustrated by numerical experiments. Key Words. systems finite elements, mesh tying, least-squares, first-order elliptic 1...|$|E
40|$|For {{achieving}} high-quality LIDARgrammetry {{and performing}} surface reconstruction by 3 D point clouds acquired at different locations or in different coordinate systems, a novel method was proposed and is called <b>tie</b> voxel <b>method,</b> in which voxel denotes “volume element”. The motivation, ideas and concrete {{formulation of the}} <b>tie</b> voxel <b>method</b> are to be given. Its potential applications are discussed. On the one hand, the theoretical quality of the <b>tie</b> voxel <b>method</b> is studied by using simulated data points. On the other hand, some tests are also done by using real airborne LIDAR points. One of diverse types of tie voxels is tie cuboid. This paper describes the <b>tie</b> cuboid <b>method.</b> This method {{can be used for}} multi-strips airborne LIDAR points registration. It is hoped that the blunder LIDAR points and the systematic errors could and must be detected somehow. The theoretical accuracy and reliability of the <b>tie</b> cuboid <b>method</b> is then studied by using simulated LIDAR points. Test results verify that the <b>tie</b> cuboid <b>method</b> provides good accuracy and reliability for airborne LIDAR point registration, even in the case of improper point distribution on a side plane. The method exploits all implicit geometric conditions such as coplanarity, colinearity and perpendicularity so that it can provide good geometric strength for 3 D point cloud registration. Also, the test results using multiple tie cuboids between two neighboring LIDAR strips show that this method can determine an accurate vertical drift parameter SZ with the a posteriori standard deviation ± 0. 0494 m� 0. 25 �z, where �z=± 0. 20 m denotes the a priori standard deviation of Z-coordinate of a LIDAR point. Moreover, some tests are also done by using real airborne LIDAR points with a priori standard deviations ± 0. 15 m and ± 0. 30 m in vertical and horizontal direction, respectively. The root mean square distance 0. 213 m of a LIDAR point to the corresponding plane is achieved. These test results verify the applicability of the proposed <b>tie</b> cuboid <b>method.</b> 1...|$|R

30|$|Toxicity tests using Daphnia magna are {{considered}} an effective biological assessment of aquatic environments because of various advantages such as broad distribution, ease of cultivation in laboratory, short life cycle, high reproduction rate, {{and sensitivity to}} toxicants (Farré and Barceló 2003). Indeed, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has standardized the assessment methodology for using Daphnia magna; they suggest the use of whole effluent toxicity test (WET) and toxicity identification evaluation (<b>TIE)</b> <b>methods</b> to estimate the biological assessment of contaminated water such as industrial wastewater and AMD (US Environmental Protection Agency 2002). The WET method is an integrated tool {{used to measure the}} toxicity of wastewater that is comprised of a diverse number of undefined toxicants. In contrast, the <b>TIE</b> <b>method</b> can be used to identify the main cause of toxicity, in which the procedures consist of the fractionation of wastewater by either physical and/or chemical manipulations. Both WET and TIE have been successfully applied to identify toxicants in industrial wastewater and environmental samples (Villamar et al. 2011; de Melo et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Context-dependent HMMs are {{commonly}} used in speech recognition. Parameter sharing needed for this model can be realized by two methods: context clustering or tied-mixture. In speech recognition, the former {{is reported to be}} more precise. However, there is some difficulty in applying context clustering to handwritten word recognition, since the distribution of each character is typically a mixture of different distributions, such as block-printed, cursive, etc. For this reason, successful results reported so far are limited to the tied-mixture approach. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel parameter <b>tying</b> <b>method</b> “Partial Tied-Mixture”, where the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) consists of a portion of all Gaussians. Furthermore, we derive a method to concurrently optimize context clustering and GMM. Experiments on the CEDAR database show that the proposed method outperforms tied-mixture both in terms of precision and computational cost.

40|$|Deep {{neural network}} (DNN) based speech recognizers have {{recently}} replaced Gaussian mixture (GMM) based systems as the state-of-the-art. HMM/DNN systems have kept many re-finements of the HMM/GMM framework, {{even though some}} of these may be suboptimal for them. One such example is the creation of context-dependent tied states, for which an ef-ficient decision tree state <b>tying</b> <b>method</b> exists. The tied states used to train DNNs are usually obtained using the same tying algorithm, even though it is based on likelihoods of Gaus-sians. In this paper, we investigate an alternative state cluster-ing method that uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of DNN output vectors to build the decision tree. It has al-ready been successfully applied within the framework of KL-HMM systems, and here we show that it is also beneficial for HMM/DNN hybrids. In a large vocabulary recognition task we report a 4 % relative word error rate reduction using this state clustering method.

40|$|The cobalt-containing MCM- 41 {{can be used}} as the {{catalyst}} for the liquid-phase epoxidation of styrene with molecular oxygen. The correlations between its structures, especially the states of Co in it, and its catalytic performance were studied. It may be helpful to make clear the nature of active sites for the epoxidation. Co-MCM- 41 samples synthesized by a template-ion exchange (<b>TIE)</b> <b>method,</b> a direct hydrothermal (DHT) method and a conventional impregnation method have been characterized in detail. The X-ray diffraction and N- 2 -adsorption results indicate that the hexagonal array of mesopores in these samples is sustained as the cobalt contents are lower than 2. 2 %. The results of diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy and H- 2 temperature-programmed- reduction suggest that the cobalt introduced into Co-MCM- 41 by the <b>TIE</b> <b>method</b> exists mainly as single-site Co(II) ions, whereas the cobalt in the sample synthesized by the DHT method exists mainly as Co 2 SiO 4 in a microcrystalline form and the samples prepared by the impregnation method contain a large proportion of cobalt oxide. With a similar cobalt content (ca 1. 0 %), the sample prepared by the <b>TIE</b> <b>method</b> gave a conversion of 45 % in the epoxidation of styrene with molecular oxygen, however, the sample prepared by the DHT method or impregnation method gave a conversion lower than 30 %. Since cobalt oxide and Co 2 SiO 4 show a lower activity for the epoxidation reaction and there may also exist a small part of single-site Co(II) ions in the samples prepared by the DHT method or impregnation method, we thus suggest that the single-site Co(II) ions in MCM- 41 are the real active sites for the epoxidation with molecular oxygen...|$|R

Manual procedure for question generation suffers from human errors and is time consuming. Various automatically generated questions are used to construct decision tree. There are three approaches to generate questions to construct HMMs based on decision tree. One approach is based on misrecognized phonemes, another approach basically uses feature table and the other is based on state distributions corresponding to context-independent sub-word units. In this paper, all these methods of automatic question generation are applied to the decision tree on FARSDAT corpus in Persian language and their results are compared with those of manually generated questions. The results show that automatically generated questions yield much better results and can replace manually generated questions in Persian language...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an accurate and efficient computational {{strategy for the}} 3 D simulation of heterogeneous structures with unreinforced masonry (URM) components. A mesoscale modelling approach is employed for the URM parts, while other material components are modelled independently with continuous meshes. The generally non-matching meshes of the distinct domains are coupled {{with the use of}} a mesh <b>tying</b> <b>method.</b> The physical interaction between the components is captured with the use of zero-thickness cohesive interface elements. This strategy enables the optimisation of the individual meshes leading to increased computational efficiency. Furthermore, the elimination of the mesh compatibility requirement allows the 3 D modelling of complex heterogeneous structures, ensuring the accurate representation of each component's nonlinear behaviour and their interaction. Numerical examples, including a comparative analysis on the elastic and nonlinear response of a masonry bridge considering arch-backfill interaction and the nonlinear simulation of a multi-leaf wall, are presented to show the unique features of the proposed strategy as well as its predictive power in comparison with experimental and numerical results found in the literature...|$|E
