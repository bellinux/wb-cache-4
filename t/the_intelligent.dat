According to Suetonius, he even wrote {{a book on the}} subject of hair care. With regard to Domitian's personality, however, the account of Suetonius alternates sharply between portraying Domitian as the emperor-tyrant, a man both physically and intellectually lazy, and <b>the</b> <b>intelligent,</b> refined personality drawn elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in 1828, Paris. Sebastian, now <b>the</b> <b>intelligent</b> but immoral 3rd Marquess of Dain, meets his match in Miss Jessica Trent, who has {{arrived in the}} city to rescue her unintelligent, nearly penniless brother Bertie from Dain's bad influence. Dain and Jessica are {{instantly}} attracted to the other, though each seeks to hide their feelings. Dain has developed a hard, sarcastic personality; he is hostile to noblewomen, as he believes they care only for money. Jessica, a 27-year-old beautiful, strong-willed bluestocking, has refused dozens of marriage proposals over the years and wishes to maintain her independence.|$|E
5|$|Dan Ferreira {{is a fan}} of Elvis Presley, {{portrayed as}} a womaniser and a bully. He claims to be a widower, talking about his wife as being dead, both to the {{neighbours}} and his children, but they have merely separated after she had an affair with his best friend, with whom she moved in. Ash is portrayed as <b>the</b> <b>intelligent</b> member of the family, the standard of his education being much higher than his siblings, so much so that he is a lecturer. He has an on/off problem with gambling, something that presumably led to the breakup of his first marriage, before he is seen on screen. Kareena is in a relationship with Tariq, though it is not a sexual one. Ronny works as a DJ under the name DJ Ronny Flawless, and Tariq is his best friend and promoter.|$|E

It also completes the control strategies and parameters calculation for <b>the</b> lower level <b>intelligent</b> agent and uploads {{the states of}} <b>the</b> lower level <b>intelligent</b> agents to <b>the</b> upper <b>intelligent</b> agent. <b>The</b> conventional voltage control intelligent agent, including reactive compensation capacitor intelligent agent, on–load tap-changer intelligent agent and STATCOM intelligent agent and so on, is mainly to complete the adjustment of the local voltage in the distribution network.|$|R

5|$|The film opens {{by cutting}} {{back and forth}} between scenes of a naval ship {{carrying}} Admiral Croft (John Woodvine), and a buggy carrying Mr. Shepherd (David Collings) and his daughter Mrs. Clay (Felicity Dean) to Kellynch Hall. Shepherd and Clay are accosted by creditors due to the debts owed by the residence's owner, Sir Walter Elliot (Corin Redgrave), while Croft discusses the end of the Napoleonic Wars with fellow men of the navy. Sir Walter, a vain foppish baronet, is faced with financial ruin unless he retrenches. Though Sir Walter initially opposes the idea, he eventually agrees to temporarily move to Bath while the hall is let; the idea came from Shepherd, family friend Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood), and Sir Walter's second eldest daughter, <b>the</b> <b>intelligent</b> Anne (Amanda Root).|$|E
5|$|Ohio is {{commonly}} noted as the Nation's Industrial Capital, dating to {{its roots in}} the Rust Belt and Ohio's present-day intelligence and scientific dominance. Ohio was one of four states in the U.S. to have areas make <b>the</b> <b>Intelligent</b> Community Forum's list of global Smart 21 Communities for 2014, with Columbus, Ohio receiving the honors. The state has 5 of the top 115 colleges in the nation, according to U.S. News and World Report's 2010 rankings, while the Ohio State University was ranked #10 by the same magazine for awarding degrees to Fortune 500 CEOs. The state was ranked #8 by the same magazine in 2008 for best high schools, while overall, in 2010 the state's schools were ranked #5 in the country by Education Week. However, by 2016 the state's high school rankings had slipped to #11 according to U.S. News and World Report, and #22 overall in quality by Education Week in 2017. It was second only to Texas in having the most U.S. cities in the top 30 best places for new college graduates, according to BusinessWeek in 2010. The year ending July 2011 saw the state ranked fourth in the nation in job creation behind Texas, California, and New York. By 2016 the state wasn't in the top 10 for job growth, and between 2015-2016, the state saw a decrease in job creation of 38,800. Since February 2010 state was 2.5% below the national average.|$|E
5|$|When {{confronted with}} the apprentice's findings, Zakary confesses to {{being part of a}} plot to conceal illegal {{experiments}} from the Shaper Council. Both he and Barzahl were sent to Sucia Island, the location where the original Geneforge game is set, where Barred Shaper technology had allowed Shapers to manipulate life in countless ways. Sucia Island.}} Instead of destroying the Geneforge, the pair agreed to spirit away the technology and experiment in private. Several of <b>the</b> <b>intelligent</b> serviles who lived on Sucia were brought along; a number of Shapers also followed Barzahl. Zakary remained in Drypeak to provide a front for the experimentation and rogue serviles which lay beyond the tunnel. Barzahl moved further into the valleys to build settlements and run experiments. Repeated use of the canisters can render the user cold, detached and possibly mad. When Zakary saw this happening to Barzahl the pair argued, Zakary regretted his part in the deceit. This occurred a year before the arrival of Shanti and the apprentice, Zakary had lost contact with Barzahl since the argument. Zakary pledges his loyalty to the Shaper Council once more and asks for help from the apprentice in dealing with what lies beyond the guarded cave.|$|E
