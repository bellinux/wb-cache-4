The Smallville version of Lionel makes a brief appearance in the second volume of the internet series Smallville: Chloe Chronicles; he threatens Chloe after she discovers he is involved with the deaths of several people.|$|E
5|$|Sociobiology is {{the study}} of how social {{behaviour}} and organization have been influenced by evolution and other biological process. The field blends sociology with a number of other sciences, such as anthropology, biology, and zoology. Sociobiology has generated controversy within the sociological academy for allegedly giving <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> gene expression over socialization and environmental factors in general (see 'nature versus nurture'). Entomologist E. O. Wilson is credited as having originally developed and described Sociobiology. Besides Sociobiology the bio-communication theory investigates interactions between non-human organisms such as animal communication, plant communication, fungal communication and communication in micro-organisms on the basis of rule-governed sign-use. In this respect any coordination of behaviour between at least two organisms is sign-mediated that underlies combinatorial (syntactic), context-dependent (pragmatic) and content-relevant (semantic) rules.|$|E

According to the author's commentary in the cover leaf of the third volume, Tite Kubo {{was in a state}} of severe emotional trauma when he wrote it, and only began to be happy with the quality of the series as it neared its ending. Speaking retrospectively 12 years later, Kubo stated that he was not yet used to the scheduling pressures of weekly serialization when he wrote Zombiepowder., and that at the time he paid <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> his editor's comments rather than trusting his own ideas.

25|$|During CBS' {{first few}} years of {{covering}} the NBA, CBS was accused of mishandling their NBA telecasts. Among the criticisms included CBS playing too much loud music, the lack of stability with the announcers, regionalizing telecasts (thus fragmenting the ratings even further), billing games as being between star players instead of teams, and devoting <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the slam dunk in instant replays.

An angry ranger takes the hobbits into another room, warning them they are drawing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> themselves. He introduces himself as Strider (Daran Norris) and asks if he may join them on their journey. At this point, the innkeeper, Barliman Butterbur (Daran Norris), arrives with a letter from Gandalf which informs Frodo that Strider is really Aragorn, a trusted friend. Attracted by Frodo's accidental use of the Ring, the Nazgûl come to Bree, but Aragorn successfully hides the hobbits.|$|E

Bull and Moon met the officers, who returned with more policemen, at the front door, pistols drawn, but after seeing that they could not win, both Bull and Moon surrendered. Less than a month later, Moon killed a man named Sam Hall by beating him on the head with his pistol. He was acquitted on the grounds of self defense in the trial that followed. Seven months later, Moon, a jealous man, attacked a gambler named Clay Wilson, believing Wilson was paying <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> his (Moon's) wife.

500|$|Smithers {{was partly}} {{based on how}} {{numerous}} Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' orientation was pitched by Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> it and should {{try to keep it}} {{in the back of their}} heads. [...] Jay Kogen said [...] "Originally he was gay and black...But we thought it was too much so we just kept him gay." [...] The script for [...] "Blood Feud" [...] originally featured Smithers saying [...] "Just leave me enough to get home to my wife and kids", but the line had to be cut for time. Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of Mr. Burns. Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers.

500|$|The {{editorial}} ad– a Neiman-Marcus tradition {{introduced by}} his father in the store's early days– both defended the city against outside critiques and offered more intimate criticisms from one who knew the town and its people well. The message said that Dallas needed to address four areas for community improvement: one, its slum problem; two, its political extremism (called [...] "absolutism" [...] in the text); three, <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> physical growth {{at the expense of}} [...] "quality" [...] in civic endeavors such as [...] "schools, colleges, symphonies, operas, and museums"; and four, a need to focus less on [...] "civic image" [...] and more on [...] "doing good things and not doing bad things", which he described as [...] "the best public relations." [...] In a 2003 article on the 40th anniversary of the assassination, Ralph Blumenthal of The New York Times praised the message as [...] "strik a perfect balance", though he notes the author met not only with support from some, but from canceled accounts and [...] "anti-Semitic attacks" [...] that only increased after an article in Life referenced Marcus's Jewish heritage.|$|E

500|$|O'Mahoney and Winter {{began working}} on the film in 2006. Winter had watched a film called The Women's Story, about two Iraqi women who had journeyed {{around the country and}} filmed what they saw. They wanted to make a {{documentary}} about [...] "the people never seen on the evening news, [...] presidents, prime ministers, generals and militants ... claiming to know something of Iraq's future". Winter explained that [...] "all these documentaries coming out of Iraq were done for or by adults. Iraqi children had not been more than a UN statistic about the dead, kidnapped or injured", so they decided to concentrate on what they viewed as the [...] "real source of Iraq's future" [...] – teenagers. [...] "I wanted {{to tell the story of}} Iraq in a different way. As journalists, we do stories about kids and teenagers, but we don't hear from them. If you go to the UN reports, they are just a number and that's it." [...] O'Mahoney was a little more reticent; he had recently worked in Iraq but did not wish to return due to the civil war and the deteriorating condition of the country. When it was decided to use a school as a backdrop to the story, which could also be used to provide a chronological narrative, O'Mahoney and Winter realised it would be too dangerous for the students to be seen with either a Western or Iraqi camera crew because it would draw <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> them, and so they decided that the students would film the documentary themselves.|$|E
500|$|With {{his next}} album, the new decade found Morrison {{following}} his muse into uncharted territory and sometimes merciless reviews. In February 1980, Morrison {{and a group}} of musicians travelled to Super Bear, a studio in the French Alps, to record (on the site of a former abbey) what is considered to be the most controversial album in his discography; later [...] "Morrison admitted his original concept was even more esoteric than the final product." [...] The album, Common One, consisted of six songs; the longest, [...] "Summertime in England", lasted fifteen and one-half minutes and ended with the words,"Can you feel the silence?". NME magazine's Paul Du Noyer called the album [...] "colossally smug and cosmically dull; an interminable, vacuous and drearily egotistical stab at spirituality: Into the muzak." [...] Greil Marcus, whose previous writings had been favourably inclined towards Morrison, critically remarked: [...] "It's Van acting the part of the 'mystic poet' he thinks he's supposed to be." [...] Morrison insisted the album was never [...] "meant to be a commercial album." [...] Biographer Clinton Heylin concludes: [...] "He would not attempt anything so ambitious again. Henceforth every radical idea would be tempered by some notion of commerciality." [...] Later, critics reassessed the album more favourably with the success of [...] "Summertime in England". Lester Bangs wrote in 1982, [...] "Van was making holy music even though he thought he was, and us rock critics had made our usual mistake of paying <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the lyrics." ...|$|E

As his feelings for Kiri grow, he is able to touch Kiri without any detrimental effects. Narumi eventually develops feelings for Kiri; he has romantic dreams about her, and even accidentally kisses her at the end of volume 8. In volume 9, he even stays with Kiri to watch over the house while her dad was in L.A. Narumi usually calls Kiri, [...] "Mussy Head".
