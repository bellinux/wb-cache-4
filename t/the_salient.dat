5|$|Operation Citadel {{called for}} a double envelopment, {{directed}} at Kursk, to surround the Soviet defenders of five armies and seal off <b>the</b> <b>salient.</b> Army Group Centre would provide General Walter Model's 9th Army to form the northern pincer. It would cut through the northern face of <b>the</b> <b>salient,</b> driving south to the hills east of Kursk, securing the rail line from Soviet attack. Army Group South would commit the 4th Panzer Army, under Hermann Hoth, and Army Detachment Kempf, under Werner Kempf, to pierce the southern face of <b>the</b> <b>salient.</b> This force would drive north to meet the 9th Army east of Kursk. Von Manstein's main attack was to be delivered by Hoth's 4th Panzer Army, spearheaded by the II SS Panzer Corps under Paul Hausser. The XLVIII Panzer Corps, commanded by Otto von Knobelsdorff, would advance on the left while Army Detachment Kempf would advance on the right. The 2nd Army, {{under the command of}} Walter Weiss, would contain the western portion of <b>the</b> <b>salient.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} determine whether or not guinea pigs and quail associated a familiar stimulus from <b>the</b> more <b>salient</b> modality with sickness. The {{investigation was}} also designed {{to determine whether or}} not increased familiarity with <b>the</b> more <b>salient</b> stimulus influenced <b>the</b> aversion quail and guinea pigs formed to a less <b>salient</b> stimulus. <b>The</b> animals were either familiarized or not familiarized with an experimental cue from <b>the</b> more <b>salient</b> modality; blue water for the quail and saccharin water for the guinea pigs. On the Training Day each animal was permitted access to the experimental cue along with a novel stimulus from the same modality or from a different modality; NaCl water or red water for guinea pigs and red water or HCl water for quail. The animals were then injected with a poison or neutral solution. The animals' aversion to the solutions was determined after their recovery from the injection. [...] Guinea pigs did not form an aversion to familiar saccharin water, <b>the</b> more <b>salient</b> cue, but did form an aversion to a novel saccharin solution. Furthermore, quail did not form an aversion to familiar blue water, <b>the</b> more <b>salient</b> cue, but did form an aversion to a novel blue solution. The data also indicated that guinea pigs did not associate red water, <b>the</b> less <b>salient</b> cue, with sickness while familiar or novel saccharin water was present. They did, however, associate red water with sickness if tap water flavor was the only cue available from <b>the</b> more <b>salient</b> modality. Similar data collected from quail indicated that they did not associate HCl water with sickness while familiar or novel blue water was present. However, they did associate HCl water with sickness if the tap water color was the only cue available from <b>the</b> more <b>salient</b> modality...|$|R

5|$|On 23 December, Lieutenant-General Dempsey's XIII Corps {{launched}} a new attack to push back the German line from Orsogna.

50|$|Because reverse salients {{limit system}} {{development}}, the {{further development of}} the system lies in the correction of <b>the</b> reverse <b>salient,</b> where correction is attained through incremental or radical innovations. <b>The</b> reverse <b>salient</b> denotes a focusing device, {{in the words of}} Nathan Rosenberg, for technological system stakeholders, which strive to remove it through innovation. It is possible that <b>the</b> reverse <b>salient</b> is not able to be corrected within the bounds of the existing technological system through incremental innovations. Consequently, radical innovations may be needed to correct <b>the</b> reverse <b>salient.</b> However, radical innovations can lead to the creation of new and different technological systems, as witnessed in the emergence of the alternating current system that overcame the problem of low cost electricity distribution, which the direct current system could not.|$|R

5|$|On the {{following}} day, 9 July, {{a meeting of}} the commanders of the German forces on the northern side of the Kursk salient concluded that a breakthrough on the northern side of <b>the</b> <b>salient</b> was unlikely.

5|$|Operation Medak Pocket {{took place}} in a salient south of Gospić, from September 9–17. The {{offensive}} was undertaken by the Croatian army to stop Serbian artillery in the area from shelling nearby Gospić. The operation met its stated objective of removing the artillery threat, as Croatian troops overran <b>the</b> <b>salient,</b> but it was marred by war crimes. The ICTY later indicted Croatian officers for war crimes. The operation was halted amid international pressure, and an agreement was reached that the Croatian troops were to withdraw to positions held prior to September 9, while UN troops were to occupy <b>the</b> <b>salient</b> alone. The events that followed remain controversial, as Canadian authorities reported that the Croatian army intermittently fought against the advancing Canadian Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry before finally retreating after sustaining 27 fatalities. The Croatian ministry of defense and UN officer's testimonies given during the Ademi-Norac trial deny that the battle occurred.|$|E

In the latter part of May 1917, the 6th Infantry Regiment was declared ready for introduction to combat and was placed at the disposal of the French for service at the front. In July 1918, a strategic offensive plan was agreed upon by the Allied commanders, the immediate purpose of which was to reduce <b>the</b> <b>salients</b> which interfered with further offensive operations. One of these was <b>the</b> Saint-Mihiel <b>salient.</b> <b>The</b> First U.S. Army was organized on 10 August and directed to launch an offensive on 12 September to reduce this <b>salient.</b> <b>The</b> 6th Regiment was destined {{to play an important role}} in this operation.

When the less-salient provincial elections are held concurrently with <b>the</b> highly <b>salient</b> municipal elections, we observe three main effects: (1) turnout increases significantly by almost ten percentage points; (2) issues that are specific of <b>the</b> more <b>salient</b> (mayoral) contest affect <b>the</b> less <b>salient</b> (provincial) contest, with mayors' fiscal decisions impacting on the vote share of provincial incumbents; (3) issues that are specific to <b>the</b> less <b>salient</b> (provincial) contest stop affecting provincial elections outcomes. These findings shed light on how voters acquire information on incumbent politicians, and proves that the effectiveness of an election as an accountability tool may be hindered by the concurrence with higher-stakes elections...|$|R

5|$|The Red Army's winter counter-offensive {{drove the}} Wehrmacht from Moscow, {{but the city}} was still {{considered}} to be threatened, with the front line relatively close. Because of this, the Moscow theater remained a priority for Stalin, who at first {{appeared to be in}} shock due to the initial German success. In particular, the initial Soviet advance was unable to reduce the Rzhev salient, held by several divisions of Army Group Center. Immediately after the Moscow counter-offensive, a series of Soviet attacks (the Battles of Rzhev) were attempted against <b>the</b> <b>salient,</b> each time with heavy losses on both sides. By early 1943, the Wehrmacht had to disengage from <b>the</b> <b>salient</b> as the whole front was moving west. Nevertheless, the Moscow front was not finally secured until October 1943, when Army Group Center was decisively repulsed from the Smolensk landbridge and from the left shore of the upper Dnieper {{at the end of the}} Second Battle of Smolensk.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet leadership, {{through their}} {{intelligence}} agencies and foreign sources, {{learned about the}} German intentions, and therefore the multiple delays by the German high command, OKW, allowed them {{a great deal of}} time to prepare their defences. Employing defence in depth, they constructed a series of defensive lines to wear down the attacking panzer formations. Three belts made up of extensive minefields, anti-tank ditches, and anti-tank gun emplacements were created; behind those were an additional three belts, which were mostly unoccupied and less fortified. The Voronezh Front, commanded by General Nikolai Vatutin, defended the southern face of <b>the</b> <b>salient.</b> The Steppe Front, commanded by Colonel General Ivan Konev, formed the strategic reserve. It was to be held back east of <b>the</b> <b>salient</b> until the time was right for the Soviet counteroffensive.
