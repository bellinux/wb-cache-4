5000|$|In 2012, Hoppa and Mine-Us {{produced}} {{their third}} collaboration album, Everything Is A-Okay; its title track was commended as [...] "an uplifting <b>track</b> <b>telling</b> the listeners to {{not give up}} and to look forward, amongst all the crap that might be coming upon them. It's a great beat accompanied by tried and true rhymes. The video is rugged with glitchy shots of Mine+US rapping his verses".|$|E
5000|$|In May 2017, Ben {{appeared}} in an advertising campaign for Australia's leading mobile bookmaker, Sportsbet. The campaign launches Sportsbet's new Android app, and Ben cheekily claims it [...] "has {{tested positive for}} speed and power, again and again." [...] The campaign tagline is [...] "Putting the 'Roid in Android" [...] and concludes with Ben in the starters block on a racing <b>track,</b> <b>telling</b> punters to [...] "get on it!" [...] The ad {{can be found on}} YouTube.|$|E

5000|$|The {{song was}} Gabriel's first UK Top 10 {{as a solo}} artist. Gabriel's first two solo albums were {{distributed}} in the US by Atlantic Records, but they rejected his third album (which contained this <b>track),</b> <b>telling</b> Gabriel he was committing [...] "commercial suicide". Atlantic dropped him but tried to buy the album back when [...] "Games Without Frontiers" [...] took off in the UK and started getting airplay in the US. At this point, Gabriel {{wanted nothing to do}} with Atlantic and let Mercury Records distribute the album in America.|$|E
5000|$|While {{recording}} [...] "Good for You" [...] with Icona Pop, Berger presented {{them with}} Charli's work on [...] "I Love It". Band member Aino Jawo {{said she felt}} {{a connection to the}} song because it mirrored her own experiences, and the line [...] "You're from the 70s but I'm a 90s bitch" [...] reminded her of an older man she had known. Member Caroline Hjelt described Charli XCX's original demo as [...] "more cute, in a way…really cool and cocky". Icona Pop approached Swedish producer Style of Eye to make a rougher version of the <b>track,</b> <b>telling</b> him, [...] "We want the punkiness. We want the 'fuck it' feeling." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mine, {{in total}} contrast, deals with introspective subjects. In accordance, the band departs from its guitar sound and {{experiments}} with different arrangements on this side, with Nuno Bettencourt playing keyboards {{in addition to}} (and in some tracks, instead of) the guitar. The side opening song, [...] "Seven Sundays", is a slow waltz with prominent keyboards and no guitars. [...] "Tragic Comic" [...] is a mostly acoustic <b>track</b> <b>telling</b> a light-hearted love story. [...] "Our Father" [...] is sung {{from the perspective of}} the child of an absent father (although many interpret the song to be dealing with God as The Father). With [...] "Stop The World", the album starts to delve into more philosophical questions, expressing existential doubts — a theme that leads to religion, with [...] "God Isn't Dead?" [...] (written with the verb form as an affirmation but with a question mark — the chorus says [...] "Please tell me God isn't dead... I want to know") and [...] "Don't Leave Me Alone", a dramatic plea. The latter was not included in the CD version because of lack of space; Nuno Bettencourt recalls leaving it out [...] "was like cutting off my arm". Despite not being bound by the limitations of the CD format, the version of the album downloadable from iTunes also omits [...] "Don't Leave Me Alone".|$|E
50|$|The {{magnetic}} tape is {{laid on the}} surface of the floor or buried in a 10mm channel; not only does it provide the path for the AGV to follow but also strips of the tape in different combinations of polarity, sequence, and distance laid alongside the <b>track</b> <b>tell</b> the AGV to change lane, speed up, slow down, and stop.|$|R
50|$|The album's nine <b>tracks</b> <b>tell</b> {{the story}} of a Dragon War coming upon the nations. The story unfolds over a twenty-four-hour timespan; with the sun rising in the beginning, setting in the middle, and finally rising again at the end. For the final two tracks Groundation calls upon their elders and reggae legends Don Carlos and The Congos to take up the fight.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>track</b> <b>tells</b> {{the story}} of an ant colony in a {{beautiful}} forest called Ants'hillvania (a pun on Pennsylvania). The colony is filled with kind, fun-loving, and virtuous ants, led by their village leader, the CommandAnt. The ants value work and each other, and live by [...] "the Wisdom from Above", or in other words, the word of God, which keeps their colony together through hard times.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{recording}} of U2's 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind, lead vocalist Bono was aware that his father, Bob Hewson, was beginning to die from cancer. Bono subsequently wrote a song about him called [...] "Tough", as that was the impression he always had of his father; he called him: [...] "A tough old boot of a guy. Irish, Dub, north side Dubliner, very cynical about {{the world and the}} people in it, but very charming and funny with it." [...] After Bob died in 2001, Bono sang the song at his funeral. For {{the recording}} of the band's following album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, they revisited the song. While listening to it with Bono and guitarist the Edge, producer Steve Lillywhite critiqued the <b>track,</b> <b>telling</b> them that it did not have a chorus and that each verse simply was followed by the line [...] "sometimes you can't make it on your own". Bono then asked for a guitar to play and spontaneously sang the lines [...] "And it's you when I look na na na na / And it's you du du du du du du du / Sometimes you can't make it on your own". Even though Bono had not yet written the rest of the lyrics for this new segment, Lillywhite said: [...] "all of a sudden the song was finished. That song had been around for the best part of five years and no one had ever said to them that it didn't have a chorus." ...|$|E

The opening track 'Gooski's Ladder' sets a tone for the album that will leave you begging for more and there is so, so much more... 10/10." ...|$|R

50|$|Upon release, Poletown {{was largely}} ignored by radio, {{even from the}} band's long-time {{supporter}} WDVE.
