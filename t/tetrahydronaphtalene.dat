High cell growth inhibition against four tumour cell lines {{was observed at}} a nanomolar level with dihydronaphtalenes 1 d, e and 1 h, <b>tetrahydronaphtalene</b> 2 c and naphtalene 3 c. Structure-activity relationships are also considered. These compounds exhibited a significant inhibitory activity toward tubulin polymerization (IC(50)  =  2 - 3  μM), {{comparable to that of}} isoCA- 4. The effect of the lead compounds 1 e and 2 c on the cancer cells tested was associated with cell cycle arrest in the G(2) /M phase. Docking studies reveal that these compounds showed a binding mode similar to those observed with their non-constraint isoCA- 4 and isoerianin congeners...|$|E
40|$|The thermal diusion phenomena, {{also known}} as the Soret eect, is {{important}} for the study of compositional variation in hydrocarbon reservoirs. Several theoretical models have been developed over the years to predict the thermodiusion coefficient of an organic mixture. Firoozabadi et al. [1] developed an analytical relationship between the thermal, molecular, and pressure diusion coefficients based on the approach of Dougherty and Drickamer [2]. The distinctive feature of Firoozabadi's model is its ability to be used not only for binary mixtures but also for multicomponent mixtures. The verification of Firoozabadi's model by numerical simulations was limited to binary mixtures only {{because of a lack of}} experimental data on thermodiusion coefficients in multicomponent hydrocarbon mixtures. However, Platten et al. [3] were able to measure the thermodiusion coefficients of a ternary hydrocarbon mixture experimentally by utilizing the thermogravitational column technique, hence making it possible to verify the theoretical model. This paper will compare the density, thermodiusion, and molecular diusion coefficients obtained with the Fontainebleau benchmark values for binary mixtures of n-dodecane, isobutylbenzene, and <b>tetrahydronaphtalene.</b> The accuracy of the numerical results from the Firoozabadi's model for ternary hydrocarbon mixtures is investigated. Results reveal a positive agreement between experimental and numerical data. © Copyright 2005 Walter de Gruyter. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
