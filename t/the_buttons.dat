5|$|Most of the Nagas, {{except the}} Naga Epic, Naga Hex, and Naga Hex v2, which {{received}} mixed reviews, {{were met with}} positive reviews from critics. The primary reason for the Naga Epic's mixed reviews was because of its price, although reviewers liked its wireless capabilities. The main criticism of both the Naga Hex and Naga Hex v2 was the arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>buttons.</b>|$|E
5|$|Currently, male {{students}} wear white studded shirts with Traditional Chinese {{characters of the}} school name on it in red. Navy blue shorts are worn for years one and two, and long pants for upper secondary levels. The six metal buttons bearing the school name is sewed onto the shirt as a modification to the traditional design adopted by other traditional Chinese schools, where rings were used to secure <b>the</b> <b>buttons.</b> Fe{{male students}} wear white blouses bearing the Traditional Chinese characters of the school name on it in red, with navy blue pleated skirts. During Assemblies and important functions, every student will wear a red-coloured school tie.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 2017, at the 135th annual Supreme Convention in St. Louis, Missouri, Supreme Knight Carl A. Anderson {{announced}} a new uniform of the Fourth Degree to include a blue blazer with the emblem as a patch and on <b>the</b> <b>buttons,</b> a white shirt, a Fourth Degree tie, dark gray slacks and a beret with the emblem. According to some Catholic news sources, the new uniform is considered controversial by some of its members, drawing criticism for its attempt to make its members appear (at first glance) to be military veterans {{as opposed to a}} fraternal religious group.|$|E
50|$|Shank buttons have {{a hollow}} {{protrusion}} {{on the back}} through which thread is sewn to attach <b>the</b> <b>button.</b> Button shanks may be made from a separate piece of the same or a different substance as <b>the</b> <b>button</b> itself, and added {{to the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>button,</b> or be carved or moulded directly onto the back of <b>the</b> <b>button,</b> in which latter case <b>the</b> <b>button</b> is referred to by collectors as having a 'self-shank'.|$|R
50|$|A {{button cover}} is an object larger than <b>the</b> <b>button</b> that it covers, and closes over <b>the</b> <b>button,</b> thereby making <b>the</b> <b>button</b> {{too large to}} pass through its hole. These, however, have the {{weakness}} in which <b>the</b> <b>button</b> can {{be removed from the}} garment with enough force, thereby making it less effective, and damaging the garment when it is breached.|$|R
50|$|Besides sports, Cindrić {{really enjoyed}} playing <b>the</b> <b>button</b> box {{accordion}} and guitar in her leisure time, playing <b>the</b> <b>button</b> box with <b>the</b> International <b>Button</b> Box Club.|$|R
5|$|The Nord Stage is multitimbral – {{each of the}} Piano, Organ, and Synth {{sections}} {{can sound}} independently. There are two Panels – A and B – each of which provides a separate configuration of the three sections within a single Program. Panels can be played independently, {{with one of the}} panels being controlled via an external MIDI keyboard controller, or they can be layered together, allowing for a maximum of 6 part multitimbral. Most of <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> and knobs on the Stage, such as volume, instrument selection, drawbar levels (for organ) or filter controls (for synthesizer) can also be adjusted by the external keyboard.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>buttons</b> worn on the Infantryman's {{clothing}} {{is not as}} minor a detail as it would sound. The average infantryman may have had his uniform made for him in Richmond, Virginia, however, the man enlisted in Georgia, and is now marching through the former state. In reflection to his loyalties to home, this man, for example, could have adorned his uniform with Georgia State buttons. This would indicate to his fellow soldiers his allegiance to both his state and his military unit. This was common practice during the war for {{both sides in the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|The {{connectors}} at {{the back}} of the Stage allow the connection of a sustain pedal, a swell pedal for organ, a footswitch to select the rotary speaker emulation speed, and a control pedal to modify effects such as wah-wah. A set of screw-in legs are an available option for the 88 and 76 note models and a custom designed soft case is also available from Clavia. A third party company, Ocean Beach Digital, has manufactured a set of MIDI controlled drawbars for the Nord Stage, for users who prefer to use real drawbars instead of <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> provided as standard.|$|E
50|$|The {{specific}} Reddit community (subreddit) for <b>the</b> <b>Button</b> had <b>the</b> standard Reddit appearance {{but with}} a molly-guarded button next to a 60-second countdown timer {{at the top of}} the page. When <b>the</b> <b>button</b> was clicked, <b>the</b> countdown would reset. <b>The</b> <b>button</b> could only be pressed once by each unique Reddit account created before the event started on 1 April. There was also a cumulative count of all unique users who had clicked <b>the</b> <b>button</b> since its launch. <b>The</b> <b>Button</b> was a light blue color.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Button</b> lends {{its name}} to a Penn gossip and news blog, Under <b>the</b> <b>Button.</b>|$|R
50|$|A thread shank {{is created}} by loosely {{stitching}} a shankless button onto fabric. This is usually done by keeping a toothpick or other small object in between <b>the</b> <b>button</b> and fabric while <b>the</b> <b>button</b> is stitched on. Once <b>the</b> <b>button</b> has been sewn through a few times, the toothpick is removed and the needle is moved down {{through one of the}} buttonholes, placing the needle and its thread in between <b>the</b> <b>button</b> and fabric. <b>The</b> sewer takes care to not tighten the thread too much. While holding <b>the</b> <b>button</b> away from <b>the</b> garment, the thread is then firmly wrapped around <b>the</b> <b>button</b> (in between <b>the</b> <b>button</b> and fabric) a few times to form a sturdy wrapper for the other threads. The needle is then pushed through the fabric to the underside of the garment, where it can then be securely fastened off. A thread shank's length depends on the thickness of the fabric that will be <b>buttoned.</b> <b>The</b> ideal thread shank is long enough to <b>button</b> <b>the</b> fabric and still have the garment draping nicely, but short enough that <b>the</b> <b>button</b> does not flop around when buttoned.|$|R
5|$|The {{deadline}} for the final cut, including the visual effects was April 30. All elements of the episode had been completed {{with the exception of}} the soundtrack, the recording for which began on May 5. The recording was light-hearted, with McCarthy working some jokes into the titles of the musical pieces, such as The War of <b>the</b> <b>Buttons</b> and a reference to the end of the season, with a piece entitled An Ode to Summer. In two of the pieces, McCarthy worked in Jerry Goldsmith's Voyager theme, both at the end of the episode and several bars of it as the ship engages the Dauntless in the slipstream.|$|E
5|$|Additional modes can be {{unlocked}} in the game. For Boss Rush Mode, {{the player}} {{is required to}} complete the game once and can then fight the bosses from the game in order {{with the number of}} bosses depending on the level of difficulty selected. Maxim Mode requires the player to finish the game with the best ending and allows the player to take control of Maxim. Unlike Juste, Maxim cannot equip items and can only use his sword and giant shuriken (sub weapon) as weapons. Maxim also has the ability to triple jump and cast certain spells by inputting certain combinations on <b>the</b> <b>buttons.</b> Finishing with the best ending also unlocks an option to listen to the music of the game.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1815, Bute had his Glamorgan estates fully surveyed, which {{highlighted}} that the estates had been neglected {{for many years}} and were now in a poor condition. Edward Richards became the senior official in charge of the estates by 1824 and represented Bute on both estate and political affairs across the region. Despite this, Bute retained the final authority over even quite minor issues on the estates, including making decisions on <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> to be used on local school uniforms or the reuse of a broken flag pole, for example, which could result in considerable delays as letters were sent between South Wales and Scotland. As the complexity of the Glamorgan estates grew, more officials were appointed to help manage the docks, farms and mineral interests, but these all reported separately to Bute, putting increasing pressure on the marquess.|$|E
5000|$|Later that night, Tharn {{appeared}} to him. To escape, Kelvin pressed <b>the</b> <b>button</b> {{and landed in}} a stream. Unable to swim he frantically pressed <b>the</b> <b>button</b> again, which gave him the ability to breathe under water. To escape the stream, he pressed <b>the</b> <b>button</b> yet again and landed in New Orleans in a drunken state. To escape, he pressed <b>the</b> <b>button</b> again and transported into a lab. There he met a bald man with a red mustache. He began a scientific conversation with him on proteins and amino acids. He {{came up with a}} brilliant idea to cure Coryza that would make him millions of dollars. Tharn appears again, forcing Kelvin to press <b>the</b> <b>button</b> once again. He lands in a cornfield in Seattle. He decided to kill Tharn. Moments later Tharn appears and, when Kelvin pressed <b>the</b> <b>button,</b> he died. Kelvin pressed <b>the</b> <b>button</b> again and returned to the lab with the bald scientist who informed him that he was now a millionaire. Now that <b>the</b> <b>button</b> had completed its task, it no longer worked.|$|R
50|$|The trigger {{registers}} report button presses in real-time. <b>The</b> <b>button</b> pressed {{state will}} instantly clear when <b>the</b> <b>button</b> is released.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Button</b> is a Wi-Fi {{connected}} {{push button}} designed by Peter R Jennings. <b>The</b> <b>Button</b> {{is designed for}} single-purpose, internet-enabled functions. When <b>the</b> <b>button</b> is pressed, a connection is made to a web server which will perform the desired task. Applications include a doorbell or panic button.|$|R
5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. <b>The</b> <b>buttons</b> to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the player}} and the {{opponent}} have stamina meters, both {{displayed on the}} top of the screen. The meters decrease when either boxer gets hit by a punch. Boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out. Faster knockdowns will cause that boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch. Either boxer will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being knocked down (resulting in a knockout or KO) or if they are knocked down three times in the match (resulting in a technical knockout or TKO). The player can also recover some stamina while the opponent is down by pressing <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> on the controller.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 2012, the Naga 2012 was released. Similarly to the Naga Epic, it came with {{interchangeable}} side panels. The Naga 2012 supported Razer's Synapse 2.0 software allowing all <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> to be programmed and that information to be stored online. The other 2012 installment was the Naga Hex, the first mouse in the series to have only six programmable side-on buttons. Razer noted it was made for multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs), such as League of Legends and Diablo 3, instead of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs). In May of the same year, the Wraith Red edition was released. The only difference between the versions was the coloring. In March 2013, after the announcement of a partnership between Razer and Riot Games, a League of Legends style Naga Hex was released, with the only difference being the design and the change from a plastic to a matte surface.|$|E
5000|$|A second similar {{version has}} {{the child who}} is [...] "it" [...] stand {{in the center of}} <b>the</b> circle. <b>The</b> <b>button</b> is then passed behind the backs of the {{children}} in the circle, stopping at random. [...] "It" [...] tries to guess where <b>the</b> <b>button</b> is and once <b>the</b> <b>button</b> is found takes his or her place in the circle. Whoever had <b>the</b> <b>button</b> then becomes <b>the</b> new [...] "it" [...] and play begins again.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Button</b> {{garnered}} enthusiasm from Reddit users worldwide, attracting clicks {{from over}} one million unique user accounts. Various websites, browser extensions, and mobile applications were created for tracking the live statistics of <b>the</b> <b>Button</b> and enabling users to visit <b>the</b> <b>Button</b> when <b>the</b> timer dropped below a certain threshold.|$|R
5000|$|According to Egan, [...] "pretty much everyone" [...] {{agrees that}} Paul should not press <b>the</b> <b>button,</b> yet CDT endorses {{pressing}} <b>the</b> <b>button.</b>|$|R
5|$|The group {{released}} several successful albums, including December's Children (And Everybody's), Aftermath and Between <b>the</b> <b>Buttons,</b> but {{in their}} personal lives their behaviour was brought into question. In 1967, Jagger and Richards were arrested on drug charges and were given unusually harsh sentences: Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four over-the-counter pep pills he had purchased in Italy. The traditionally conservative editor of The Times, William Rees-Mogg, wrote an article critical of the sentences; and on appeal Richards' sentence was overturned and Jagger's was amended to a conditional discharge (although he ended up spending one night inside London's Brixton Prison). The Rolling Stones continued to face legal battles for the next decade.|$|E
5|$|The player {{would sit}} at the stand and press <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> to make their moves, while one panel of lights showed {{the state of the}} game, and another showed the computer's {{calculations}} during its move. The computer could be set to make its calculations at various speeds, slowing down so that the demonstrator could describe exactly what the computer was doing in real time. A visual guide attached to the Nimrod explained what the computer was doing during its turn, as well as showing possible game states and how they would be represented by the lights. Signs stating which player's turn it was and whether one or the other had won would light up as appropriate during gameplay.|$|E
5|$|They then wander to the {{concessions}} stand. There the babies find popcorn, orange and grape sodas, lids, napkins, cups, candy bars, ketchup, mustard and straws (the two teenage employees in charge, Larry and Steve, don't notice the babies because they're arguing over comic books). Tommy checks the popcorn both for Reptar, while Phil and Lil take {{interest in the}} soda dispensers, pushing <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> and spilling the soft drinks on the counters and floors until eventually they get stuck continuously pouring soda. Meanwhile, Chuckie, after sampling some candy, notices some stairs leading up while Phil and Lil start playing with the ketchup and mustard dispensers by the hot dog sections. Phil & Lil plays with straws and spill all the straws. After Chuckie points out the stairs, Tommy concludes they'll find Reptar upstairs. As soon as the babies leave, the two teenagers notice the massive mess and scream.|$|E
50|$|Shank boutons have {{a hollow}} {{protrusion}} {{on the back}} through which thread is sewn to attach <b>the</b> <b>button.</b> Button shanks may be a separate piece added {{to the back of}} a button, or be carved or moulded directly onto the back of <b>the</b> <b>button,</b> in which case <b>the</b> <b>button</b> is referred to by collectors as having a 'self-shank'. This is a common construction for older shell and glass buttons, for example. Buttons with shanks have no holes in <b>the</b> <b>button</b> blank (<b>the</b> main part of <b>the</b> <b>button)</b> itself because they are not needed for sewing. Buttons with shanks are more expensive to produce than shankless buttons.|$|R

5|$|If {{the player}} {{successfully}} matches {{a number of}} consecutive notes correctly, they boost their individual scoring multiplier up to a maximum 4x value; missing a note will reset to the multiplier back to 1x. Throughout each song's respective charts for the instruments are special highlighted phrases; completing all the notes in this phrase, and for guitar/bass players, using the whammy bar on marked sustained notes, fills part of a Star Power meter. When this meter is at least half full, the player can activate Star Power by performing special actions on their controllers: either tilting the guitar controller upward briefly or pressing the Star Power activation button for guitar and bass; striking two pads simultaneously on the drums; and either double tapping the microphone or pressing one of <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> on the game console's regular controllers for vocals. When Star Power is activated, the overall band scoring multiplier is increased for a limited time until the Star Power meter is drained. After completing a song, the band is awarded a number of stars based on the overall score; in normal modes for Warriors of Rock, up to six stars can be earned; the final being achievable only through zero misses and zero extra strums.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{versions}} of the drop seat often replace <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> with snap fasteners.|$|E
25|$|The {{buttoning}} of {{the jacket}} is primarily {{determined by the}} button stance, {{a measure of how}} high <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> are in relation to the natural waist. In some (now unusual) styles where <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> are placed high, the tailor would have intended the suit to be buttoned differently from the more common lower stance. Nevertheless, some general guidelines are given here.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{component}} of the test is [...] "extinction". Again, participants learn to press <b>the</b> <b>button</b> for picture A but not picture B. However this time, instead of the rules reversing, the rule changes altogether. Now the participant will be punished for pressing <b>the</b> <b>button</b> in response to either picture. The correct response is not to press <b>the</b> <b>button</b> at all, but people with OFC dysfunction {{find it difficult to}} resist the temptation to press <b>the</b> <b>button</b> despite being punished for it.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The LED display {{showing the}} CPU clock frequency, in MHz, of an 80486 based computer. <b>The</b> turbo <b>button</b> is <b>the</b> right small <b>button,</b> whereas <b>the</b> left small <b>button</b> is <b>the</b> reset <b>button</b> which still exists in {{computers}} as of 2017; <b>the</b> triangular <b>button</b> is <b>the</b> power <b>button.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{controls}} are mostly unchanged from R-Type, where the 8-way joystick controls the ship's movement, and <b>the</b> shot <b>button</b> fires <b>the</b> ship's main beam. <b>The</b> other <b>button</b> {{is used to}} equip or unequip Force; the series' most unusual innovation. Pressing down <b>the</b> shot <b>button</b> causes <b>the</b> blue beam gauge to fill up, and releasing <b>the</b> <b>button</b> causes a wave beam to travel a certain distance depending {{on the length of}} time <b>the</b> <b>button</b> was pressed down. If <b>the</b> <b>button</b> is pressed down until the blue gauge is fully charged, a red gauge appears and fills up quickly. Filling up the red gauge causes it to flash blue and red, releasing <b>the</b> shot <b>button</b> at this point shoots an even more powerful beam.|$|R
