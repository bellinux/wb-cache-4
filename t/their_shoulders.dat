5|$|Before {{the event}} began, a thirty-minute pre-show aired with a match between The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens) and Mikey Batts and Jerrelle Clark. The Naturals won the match by pinfall, after Stevens and Douglas lifted Batts up, placed Batts {{head and neck}} onto one of <b>their</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and fell to a seated {{position}} to perform a move they dubbed the Natural Disaster.|$|E
5|$|Pugs' {{legs are}} strong, straight, of {{moderate}} length, and are set well under. <b>Their</b> <b>shoulders</b> are moderately laid back. Their ankles are strong, their feet are small, their toes are well split-up, and their nails are black. The lower teeth normally protrude further than their upper, {{resulting in an}} under-bite.|$|E
5|$|The {{accessory}} nerve is tested by evaluating {{the function of}} the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. The trapezius muscle is tested by asking the patient to shrug <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> with and without resistance. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is tested by asking the patient to turn their head to the left or right against resistance.|$|E
50|$|This move {{sees the}} wrestler place the {{opponent}} stomach down on <b>their</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{so that they}} both are facing the same direction. The attacking wrestler then drops the opponent that they have elevated on <b>their</b> <b>shoulder</b> face-first into the turnbuckle or ropes. This move is most commonly used by The Undertaker.|$|R

5000|$|Ranks and insignia, {{similar to}} the Royal Air Force but adapted to suit {{the origins of the}} Chilean Air Force, are worn on {{shoulder}} collars and cuffs. General officers have the Condor eagle in <b>their</b> <b>shoulder</b> collars while officer cadets have a unique symbol, that of the Aviation School [...] "Captain Manuel Ávalos Prado", on <b>their</b> <b>shoulder</b> collars. On the NCOs and enlistees, only Subofficer Majors and Subofficers wear both shoulder and cuff insignia, while Graduate Soldiers wear a double capital letter E (for the Air Force Specialties School [...] "First Sergeant Adolfo Menandier Rojas") on <b>their</b> <b>shoulder</b> collars alongside <b>their</b> unique cuff marking.|$|R
5|$|When {{meeting for}} the first time or after they have separated, {{individuals}} may greet each other by rubbing and sniffing their noses followed by rubbing their cheeks, moving their noses along their bodies and sniffing each other's genitals. They then may rub and press <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> against each other and rest their heads on one another. This greeting is usually performed among harem or territorial males or among bachelor males playing.|$|E
5|$|Women wore long dresses, blouses {{that came}} down to the knee, skirts and jackets with long or short sleeves, while women from wealthy {{families}} could wear purple scarves around <b>their</b> <b>shoulders.</b> The main difference in women's apparel from that of men was that it was fastened on the left, not on the right.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} the Cook Islands is characterised by heavy drums and ukuleles. Men perform the hura, which is the {{equivalent}} of the Hawaiian hula, locking their feet on the ground and keeping <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> steady. Drums form part of an ensemble. Performing groups include the Cook Islands National Arts Theatre, Arorangi Dance Troupe, Betela Dance Troupe, Akirata Folk Dance Troupe, and Te Ivi Maori Cultural Dance Troupe. Raro Records is the main specialist in music retail on the islands.|$|E

5|$|The two lions have a male mane, {{patterned}} with dense, short lines; the manes continue beneath the body. Distinctly patterned tufts of hair grow from the lion's ears and on <b>their</b> <b>shoulders,</b> emanating from a central disk-shaped whorl. They lie prone, their heads are sculpted with attention to detail, {{but with a}} degree of artistic liberty in their form, e.g., regarding their rounded shapes. Both lions look towards the viewer, and both have their mouths closed.|$|E
5|$|Catastrophic {{injuries}} {{have been}} on a steady decline since the 1960s, due in part to rules banning dangerous forms of contact such as spearing, face tackling and butt blocking. However, catastrophic injuries are still caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, as well when players hit their heads against an opposing player's knee or the ground. Returning to play after sustaining a head injury earlier in the game also places players at risk for an even more severe injury. Many states are requiring teams to prevent players who have shown any signs of a concussion from returning to a game, while other steps such as more aggressive enforcement of safety rules and better condition of the neck muscles have been suggested. Additionally, coaches are being urged to train players to block with <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> instead of their heads.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2007, the brigade was mobilized to Fort Dix for {{training}} along with the 72nd Field Artillery Brigade from April until September. Soldiers of the 174th Infantry Brigade trained other units in land navigation, area security, urban operations, marksmanship, and live fire exercises. Most of the soldiers being trained {{were members of the}} Army National Guard. The brigade received distinctive unit insignia and shoulder sleeve insignia in September 2007. These items contained allusions to the brigade's honors during World War I and II, and its history with the 78th Infantry Division. However, as it is subordinate to the First Army, soldiers of the brigade wear that patch on <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> instead. Later that month, the brigade was again mobilized to Fort Bragg, North Carolina for another training mission.|$|E

5|$|Looking {{to improve}} their on-field product, and also to find a player with talent and star power to better compete with the Jets for New York fans' affections, the Giants {{acquired}} quarterback Fran Tarkenton from the Minnesota Vikings before the 1967 season and showed improvement. They finished 7–7 in both the 1967 and 1968 seasons. In those seasons, one of Tarkenton's favorite targets, wide receiver Homer Jones made the Pro Bowl by amassing over 2,200 yards and 21 touchdowns. The team also upset the division champion Dallas Cowboys 27–21 {{in one of their}} biggest wins in years, and the Giants' jubilant players carried Sherman off the field on <b>their</b> <b>shoulders.</b> After the game, Wellington Mara said he expected Sherman to remain the team's coach for several more seasons, however, after starting 7–3 they lost their final four games.|$|E
5|$|The artwork for {{the album}} cover of Trans-Europe Express was {{originally}} {{going to be}} a monochrome picture of the group reflected in a series of mirrors. This idea was dropped for a photo by New York-based celebrity photographer Maurice Seymour, with the group dressed in suits to resemble mannequins. J. Stara's image of the group was taken in Paris and is a highly retouched photo-montage of Kraftwerk from <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> up again posed as mannequins which are shown {{on the cover of the}} English version of the album. On the inside sleeve, a color collage of the group sitting at a small cafe table designed by Emil Schult was used. The photo for this scene was from the session by Maurice Seymour, taken on the group's American tour. Other photos were taken by Schult that show the group laughing and smiling. These were not used for the album's release.|$|E
5|$|The {{first six}} seasons {{featured}} sixteen fighters, in either {{one or two}} weight categories. The first two seasons, however, were very different from each following season. The original format for The Ultimate Fighter saw each team compete in challenges, such as hoisting their respective coach up on <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> and sprinting down a beach, or a team tug-of-war. These challenges resulted in eliminations of fighters who hadn't fought, {{until late in the}} season when the challenge incentive was to select the next fight where fighters would be eliminated, having lost the fight. In the first two seasons, fighters would also leave the house for good upon losing and this often resulted in odd numbers for teams, which forced the moving of fighters to opposing teams.|$|E

30|$|In general, a young {{patient will}} {{dislocate}} <b>their</b> <b>shoulder</b> or suffer a fracture {{of the greater}} tuberosity due to {{the force of the}} SS tendon when they fall on <b>their</b> <b>shoulder.</b> An avulsion on the scapular side, as seen in the present case, is rare. Most avulsions about the shoulder joint can be treated conservatively, as we did successfully. A review of the literature (available through PubMed) revealed several studies on avulsions of the scapula [1 – 12].|$|R

5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. They {{look like they}} are wearing armor, as they have two pauldron-shaped pieces on <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> and a fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot, with two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E
5|$|In the Jamiltepec {{region of}} Mexico, there exists {{perhaps the most}} {{colorful}} version {{of that kind of}} dance, the Chareos dance. It represents a battle between Moors, led by Pilate, and Christians, led by James, the apostle. Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer who plays the part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, white cotton square over <b>their</b> <b>shoulders,</b> velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete. In addition, the leader has a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two red flags and two white flags, red symbolizing the blood spilt by James' soldiers and white symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory. The sounds of drums and flutes accompany the dance. These dances that pit Christian against Moor are almost certainly Christianized versions of earlier, pre-Cortez dances that ritualized the battle between the tiger and the eagle.|$|E
5|$|The true {{origin of}} the rhyme is unknown, but there are several theories. Complicated metaphors are often said to exist within the lyrics, as is common with nursery rhyme exegesis. Most {{explanations}} post-date the first publication of the rhyme and have no corroborating evidence. These include the suggestion by S. Baring-Gould in the 19th century that the events were {{a version of the}} story told in the 13th-century Prose Edda Gylfaginning written by Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson. Baring-Gould stated that Hjúki and Bil, brother and sister respectively in Norse mythology, were taken up from the earth by the moon (personified as the god Máni) as they were fetching water from the well called Byrgir, bearing on <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> the cask called Saegr and the pole called Simul. Around 1835, John Bellenden Ker suggested that Jack and Jill were two priests; this was enlarged by Katherine Elwes in 1930 to indicate that Jack represented Cardinal Wolsey (c.1471–1530) and Jill was Bishop Tarbes, who negotiated the marriage of Mary Tudor to the French king in 1514.|$|E

50|$|Further to this; {{letters on}} {{shoulders}} will denote borough or newly formed basic command units {{and not the}} police station an officer is based from. An example {{of this would be}} a PC working from East Ham Police Station in the borough of Newham; the PC would have KF (Newham) on <b>their</b> <b>shoulder</b> and not KE (East Ham station). Similarly in newly merged boroughs a PC working from Holloway Police Station would have CN (Central North BCU) on <b>their</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
