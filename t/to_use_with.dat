5|$|After {{moving to}} a new ranch in Bandera, Texas, Nelson was called by {{producer}} Felton Jarvis about the upcoming scheduled recording sessions. At the time, Nelson had not written any new material. He returned to Nashville, where he wrote new songs <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>with</b> others from his old repertoire. These new concept songs were recorded in two days.|$|E

5|$|After Alyx has recovered, she and Gordon {{proceed in}} an old Resistance vehicle, battling Combine troops and {{surviving}} an encounter with a Combine Advisor, a high-ranking Combine alien. At White Forest, they are reunited with Resistance Kleiner and Eli, along with Alyx's pet robot D0g. Gordon is also introduced to the egotistical Dr. Arne Magnusson. The scientists are preparing a rocket which they plan <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>with</b> the Combine portal code and the satellite array launched by Gordon at Black Mesa to close the Combine portal.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{extensive}} damage resulting from the hurricane, where the Hornets would play for the 2005–06 season came into question. Although the New Orleans Arena suffered only slight damage, the flooding surrounding the area made it impossible <b>to</b> <b>use.</b> <b>With</b> the training camp scheduled to begin on October 4, the team announced that {{the first three weeks}} of camp would be held at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, instead of their usual location, Alario Center in Westwego. Additionally the team stated that they wanted to play home games within Louisiana, at either the Pete Maravich Assembly Center or the Rivercenter in Baton Rouge. On September 3, Hornets owner George Shinn stated that the storm would not be used as a reason to permanently relocate the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Fernandez was {{approached}} by fellow designer and stylist Formichetti to produce the dress, with it planned out {{over the course of}} a week, Formichetti having styled the look. The dress was asymmetrical, with a cowled–neck. Fernandez specifically chose cuts to ensure that the dress kept well. Flank steak was chosen as the material <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> <b>with</b> the meat coming from his family butcher. The dress required Gaga to be stitched into the outfit backstage.|$|E
5|$|The {{authorized}} {{loudspeaker enclosure}} <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>with</b> a console organ was the Hammond Tone Cabinet, which housed an external amplifier and speaker in a cabinet. The cabinet carried a balanced mono signal {{along with the}} necessary mains power directly from the organ, using a six-pin cable. Spinet organs contained a built-in power amplifier and loudspeakers, so did not require a tone cabinet.|$|E

5|$|Two {{types of}} atomic bombs were {{developed}} concurrently during the war: {{a relatively simple}} gun-type fission weapon and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Thin Man gun-type design proved impractical <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>with</b> plutonium so a simpler gun-type called Little Boy was developed that used uranium-235, an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. Chemically identical to the most common isotope, uranium-238, and with almost the same mass, it proved difficult to separate the two. Three methods were employed for uranium enrichment: electromagnetic, gaseous and thermal. Most of this work was performed at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Banjo-Kazooie {{is set in}} the Spiral Mountain {{and follows}} the story of Banjo, a male brown honey bear, and Kazooie, a female red-crested Breegull who is always kept in Banjo's backpack. The game begins when a foul-tempered witch named Gruntilda learns from her {{cauldron}} Dingpot that Tooty, Banjo's younger sister, is more beautiful than her. Jealous, Gruntilda creates a machine that can transfer a person's level of beauty to another, which she intends <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>with</b> Tooty. She then abducts Tooty from Banjo's house while he is sleeping. In response to the kidnapping, Kazooie wakes Banjo up and the two set out to rescue her. Banjo and Kazooie learn from Tooty's friend, Bottles the mole, that she was captured by Gruntilda and suggests they need some training to collect musical notes and jigsaw pieces to progress through Gruntilda's lair. Along the way, they are aided by Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman and Gruntilda's former teacher.|$|E

25|$|As {{shown in}} diagram at right, this {{phenomenon}} has relatively small effect if {{the standard deviation}} (as compared to the mean) is relatively small, as it makes the log-normal distribution appear similar to an arithmetical normal distribution.

25|$|The {{complexity}} of sequence assembly {{is driven by}} two major factors: the number of fragments and their lengths. While more and longer fragments allow better identification of sequence overlaps, they also pose problems as the underlying algorithms show quadratic or even exponential complexity behaviour to both number of fragments and their length. And while shorter sequences are faster to align, they also complicate the layout phase of an assembly as shorter reads are more difficult <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>with</b> repeats or near identical repeats.|$|E

Chick heard from missionary Bob Hammond, who had broadcast in Asia on the Voice of America, that the Communist Party of China had gained significant influence among ordinary Chinese in the 1950s through the distribution of small comic books. Chick also began working with a prison ministry and created a flip chart of illustrations <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>with</b> his presentation. He hit upon the idea of creating witnessing tracts, which could be given to people directly or indirectly.|$|E
