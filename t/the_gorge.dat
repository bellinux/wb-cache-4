5|$|Green-flowered helleborine {{is found}} {{on the western side}} of <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods. lady orchid was {{discovered}} here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley {{on the west side of}} the Gorge; there is some doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. fly orchid and bee orchid are found in <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> along with their hybrid. A single plant of lesser meadow-rue is present in <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b> Bristol rock-cress occurs here, and at nearby Penpole Point; in <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> there are about 3,000 plants on the Bristol side, and about 2,000 below Leigh Woods. Hutchinsia is found on both sides of <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b> Bloody crane's-bill grows on the Bristol side of <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> where it is believed to be native. Little robin occurs on both sides of <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b> Spiked speedwell grows on both sides of the gorge: the first British record of this plant was from <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> in 1641.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} of <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> is the Bristol suburb of Clifton, and The Downs, a large public park. To the west of <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> is Leigh Woods, the name of both a village and the National Trust forest it is {{situated}} in. There are three Iron Age hill forts overlooking <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> {{as well as an}} observatory. The Clifton Suspension Bridge, an icon of Bristol, crosses <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cheddar is a gorge {{lying on}} the {{southern}} edge of the Mendip Hills. The maximum depth of <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> is , with a near-vertical cliff-face to the south, and steep grassy slopes to the north. The B3135 road runs along the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 9 June 2015, <b>the</b> <b>Gorges</b> du Gardon were {{designated}} a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO, {{provided by the}} Joint Association coordonnée of <b>the</b> <b>gorges</b> du Gardon.|$|R
50|$|Those not {{interested}} in a climbing tour or multi-day summit tour, can hike <b>the</b> Partnach <b>Gorge,</b> <b>the</b> Leutasch <b>Gorge</b> or <b>the</b> Höllental <b>Gorge</b> in a day.|$|R
50|$|The park is {{connected}} with nearby Whirlpool State Park via the Devil's Hole Trail at <b>the</b> <b>gorge's</b> bottom, {{as well as a}} trail along <b>the</b> <b>gorge's</b> rim, which together form a complete loop.|$|R
5|$|Cheddar, its {{surrounding}} villages and specifically <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> has {{been subject to}} flooding. In the Chew Stoke flood of 1968 {{the flow of water}} washed large boulders down <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> washed away cars, and damaged the cafe and the entrance to Gough's Cave.|$|E
5|$|Longleat Estate has fenced off a {{large part}} of its land and has {{introduced}} goats, as part of a programme to encourage the biodiversity of the area; the goats were intended to replace the sheep that grazed in <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> until the 1970s. The National Trust announced in March 2007 that it plans to release a flock of sheep on its side of <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> for the same purpose, but will first consult local residents and interested parties on whether to fence off <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> or introduce cattle grids to prevent the sheep from straying. There is already a small flock of feral Soay sheep in <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>gorge</b> is {{susceptible}} to flooding. In the Chew Stoke flood of 1968 {{the flow of water}} washed large boulders down <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> damaging the cafe and entrance to Gough's Cave and washing away cars. In the cave itself the flooding lasted for three days. In 2012 the B3135, the road through <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> was closed for several weeks following damage to the road surface during extensive flooding.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gorges</b> family {{arrived in}} England with the Norman invasion. The male line of <b>the</b> <b>Gorges</b> family died out in 1331 {{on the death}} of Ralph de Gorges, 2nd Baron Gorges (d.1331), of Knighton, Isle of Wight. They were said to have lived in Somersetshire from the time of King Henry I and held their estates in Wraxall since the time of King Edward II. <b>The</b> <b>Gorges</b> were {{recipients}} of many royal appointments and privileges since Edward's time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract.

5|$|The steep gorge walls make {{an ideal}} habitat for {{peregrine}} falcons, with a plentiful {{supply of food}} nearby {{in the form of}} pigeons and sea gulls. Peregrines have a history of nesting in <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> but having become rare in the British Isles they did not breed and were rarely seen in <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> after the 1930s. In 1990 Peregrines returned to <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> and have successfully bred in most of the following years. On warm days a strong uplift forms in <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> on which birds of prey soar while hunting. <b>The</b> <b>gorge</b> also houses large populations of Jackdaw and horseshoe bats, both of which find homes in the caves and bridge buttresses.|$|E
5|$|The steep {{walls of}} <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> support some rare fauna and flora, {{including}} species unique to <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b> There are {{a total of}} 24 rare plant species and two unique trees: the Bristol and Wilmotts's whitebeams. Other notable plants include Bristol rock cress, Bristol onion, spiked speedwell, autumn squill and honewort. Because of its steep sides, there are many parts of <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> on which trees cannot grow, making way for smaller plants. <b>The</b> <b>gorge</b> {{is also home to}} rare invertebrate species. <b>The</b> <b>gorge</b> has a microclimate around 1 degree warmer than the surrounding land. The steep south-west facing sides receive the afternoon sunlight, but are partially sheltered from the prevailing winds. When winds come from the Bristol Channel in the north west they may be funnelled into <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> creating harsh and wet conditions.|$|E
5|$|There is a clifftop {{walk from}} Jacob's Ladder along {{the crest of}} <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> {{and back to the}} road, with views of <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b> A caving {{experience}} is offered within Gough's Cave. There is a path of 275steps, built up the side of <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> known as Jacob's Ladder after the Biblical description of a ladder to the heavens. A watchtower at the top provides a 360–degree view of the entire area and village. An open-top bus tour operates during the summer. Cheddar cheese is made in the lower part of <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b>|$|E
50|$|Along <b>the</b> renowned Three <b>Gorges</b> of <b>the</b> Yangtze River {{are many}} scenic spots and {{historical}} sites; <b>the</b> Qutang <b>Gorge</b> is rugged and majestic, <b>the</b> Wu <b>Gorge</b> elegant, deep and secluded, <b>the</b> Xiling <b>Gorge</b> full of shoals and reefs and rolling water. <b>The</b> Lesser Three <b>Gorges</b> are lush with greenery, flanking water so clear {{you can see}} to the bottom. <b>The</b> Three <b>Gorges</b> Dam built here is China's biggest key hydro-power project.|$|R
50|$|Almașu Mare's tourist {{objectives}} are <b>the</b> Cibu <b>Gorges,</b> <b>the</b> Glod <b>Gorges,</b> a thermal spring and the Achim Emilian ethnographical museum.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Three <b>Gorges</b> Dam was {{constructed}} at Sāndòupíng {{in the middle}} of <b>the</b> Xiling <b>Gorge.</b> Before <b>the</b> construction of <b>the</b> Three <b>Gorges</b> Dam and Gezhouba Dam, Xiling was known for being the most dangerous of <b>the</b> three <b>gorges</b> to travel through, with frightening whirlpools and strong rapids.|$|R

5|$|In the 18th century <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> was quarried {{to produce}} {{building}} stone for the city. Stone {{was taken by}} boat into the floating harbour. In the 19th century celestine was discovered in Leigh Court estate and the Miles family authorised quarrying. Between 1880 and 1920 Bristol was producing 90% of the world's Celestine, but the enterprise {{did not last long}} into the 20th century. Bristol Diamonds, brilliant quartz crystals found in geodes in dolomitic conglomerate in <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> were popular souvenirs for visitors to the Hotwells spa in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Quarries on the Bristol side of <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> are now popular with climbers and are a habitat for Peregrine falcons and other wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species have}} been reintroduced to <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b> White-tailed deer were {{imported}} from Michigan and released throughout Pennsylvania to reestablish {{what had once been}} a thriving population. The current population of deer in Pennsylvania are descended from the original stock introduced since 1906, after the lumbermen had moved out of the area. The deer population has grown so much that today they exceed their carrying capacity in many areas. River otters were successfully reintroduced in 1983 and now breed in <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b> Despite the otters' diet of 5percent trout, some anglers fear the animals would deplete the game fish in <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b>|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{damaging}} interferences to <b>the</b> <b>Gorges</b> environment occurred in 1916 when the dam containing Lake Toxaway broke. Record amounts of water gushed southward down the Toxaway River, destroying the communities in its path, scouring <b>the</b> <b>gorges</b> and leaving piles of debris 15 to 20 ft high.|$|R
50|$|The castle {{dominates the}} valley of the Sioule, at a spot where <b>the</b> <b>gorges,</b> called <b>the</b> <b>gorges</b> de Chouvigny, enlarge. It is {{approximately}} 300 metres south east of the town of Chouvigny. The road which climbs from the Sioule towards the town passes behind the castle and serves as its entrance.|$|R
50|$|In some of <b>the</b> <b>gorges</b> {{are found}} {{remnants}} of warm-temperate rainforest, the southernmost occurrence {{of this type}} of forest in the world. It can survive here as the steep walls of <b>the</b> <b>gorges</b> protect it from the annual drying summer winds and the bushfires that occasionally rage through the area.|$|R
5|$|The Vikos Gorge {{has been}} carved over {{millions}} of years by the Voidomatis river, a tributary of the Aoös. The Voidomatis is mostly seasonal, with year-round flow occurring only in the lower part of <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b> Due to its nature, the area of <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> is precipitous and impassable most of the year.|$|E
5|$|The flora include chalk grassland-loving {{species such}} as {{marjoram}} and wild thyme. The Cheddar pink, Dianthus gratianopolitanus, also known as firewitch, only grows in the wild in <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b> It was once common in <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> but declined after being picked by collectors. It {{is also home to}} unique species of whitebeam.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>gorge</b> {{area was}} {{inhabited}} {{at least as}} early as the Iron Age, probably by the Dobunni tribe. In Leigh Woods above Nightingale Valley, a steep dry valley beside the suspension bridge, is Stokeleigh Camp, one of three Iron Age hill forts in the area. Stokeleigh was occupied from 3BCE to 1CE, and was also used in the Middle Ages. The camp was protected on two sides by the cliff faces of <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> and Nightingale Valley, and was also protected by earthworks, and is now a scheduled ancient monument. A second hill fort was situated across Nightingale Valley, but has since been built on, and bridge road cuts through it. The third hill fort was situated {{on the opposite side of}} <b>the</b> <b>gorge,</b> in what is now observatory green. Archaeology, plus the configuration of the three forts, suggest they played a role in defending <b>the</b> <b>gorge.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>gorge,</b> {{which helped}} protect Bristol Harbour, has been quarried for stone {{to build the}} city, and its {{surrounding}} land has been protected from development as The Downs and Leigh Woods. The Avon estuary and <b>the</b> <b>gorge</b> are the county boundary with North Somerset, and the river flows into the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth. Another gorge, cut by the Hazel Brook (which flows into the River Trym), crosses the Blaise Castle estate in northern Bristol.|$|E
