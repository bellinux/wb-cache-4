40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a single-item {{inventory}} model with returns. The model allows lateral <b>transshipment</b> <b>of</b> returns from one inventory system to another. Each inventory system is under continuous review and an (r, Q) policy is employed as the inventory control. An approximated closed-form {{solution of the}} system steady-state probability distribution is derived when Q is large.
