5|$|Truman Burbank is {{the unsuspecting}} star of <b>The</b> <b>Truman</b> <b>Show,</b> a reality {{television}} program which is broadcast live {{around the clock}} and across the globe. His entire life has taken place within a giant arcological dome in Hollywood, fashioned to create the seaside town of Seahaven Island, and equipped with thousands of cameras to monitor all aspects of Truman's life. All of Seahaven's residents are actors, either acting out a script or repeating lines fed {{to them by the}} show's creator and executive producer, Christof, who seeks to capture Truman's real emotion and human behavior, give audiences a relatable everyman, and protect him from the outside world with a sense of normalcy.|$|E
2500|$|A {{quarter of}} a million {{casualties}} is roughly the level the Joint War Plans Committee estimated, in its paper (JWPC 369/1) prepared for Truman's 18 June meeting. A review of documents from <b>the</b> <b>Truman</b> Library <b>shows</b> Truman's initial draft response to the query describes Marshall only as saying [...] "one {{quarter of a}} million would be the minimum". The [...] "as much as a million" [...] phrase was added to the final draft by Truman's staff, so as not to appear to contradict an earlier statement given in a published article by Stimson (former Secretary of War). In a study done by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in April 1945, the figures of 7.45 casualties per 1,000 man-days and 1.78 fatalities per 1,000 man-days were developed. This implied the two planned campaigns to conquer Japan would cost 1.6 million U.S. casualties, including 380,000 dead. [...] JWPC 369/1 (prepared June 15, 1945)), which provided planning information to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated an invasion of Japan would result in 40,000 U.S. dead and 150,000 wounded. Delivered on June 15, 1945, after insight gained from the Battle of Okinawa, the study noted Japan's inadequate defenses resulting from a very effective sea blockade and the American firebombing campaign. Generals George C. Marshall and Douglas MacArthur signed documents agreeing with the Joint War Plans Committee estimate.|$|R
5|$|The film begins {{during the}} thirtieth {{year of the}} <b>show.</b> During <b>the</b> day, <b>Truman</b> notices strange occurrences that all seem {{centered}} on him (a falling spotlight, rain that only falls on him). Truman spots a disheveled man and recognizes him as his father, who had snuck back into the set, but actors quickly drag the man away. Despite efforts by Meryl and Truman's best friend Marlon to reassure Truman, Truman becomes even more suspicious about his life. One day, he takes Meryl by surprise by going on an impromptu road trip, but their way is blocked by apparent and increasingly implausible emergencies. Meryl begins to break down from the stress, and during an argument with Truman, breaks character and is later taken off <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> <b>Truman,</b> depressed and confused, is consoled by Marlon, and Christof uses the opportunity to re-introduce Truman's father to the show properly, {{under the guise of}} having lost his memory after the boating accident, in the hope of bringing Truman back to some emotional stability and a controllable state.|$|R
