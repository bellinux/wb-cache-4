A large number of former UAP members, including Treatt, then formed the Democratic Party in New South Wales, led by Alexander Mair, while others moved into the Commonwealth Party and <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b> The Democratic Party then merged with the Commonwealth Party in January 1944.

5|$|Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi of <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (LDP) {{decided to}} draft {{legislation}} {{to make the}} Hinomaru and Kimigayo official symbols of Japan in 2000. His Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, wanted the legislation {{to be completed by}} the 10th anniversary of Emperor Akihito's enthronement. This {{is not the first time}} legislation was considered for establishing both symbols as official. In 1974, with the backdrop of the 1972 return of Okinawa to Japan and the 1973 oil crisis, Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei hinted at a law being passed enshrining both symbols in the law of Japan.

Kakuei was unsuccessful in passing the law through the Diet that year.|$|E
