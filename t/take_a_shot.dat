5|$|Before {{the second}} half, no substitutions {{were made by}} either teams as Galatasaray kicked-off the match. During the third minute, Vieira picked Parlour, but his shot hit {{the outside of the}} goal. Galatasaray almost scored the opening goal, when Okan Buruk played in Hakan Şükür, whose shot hit the right post. Arsenal {{attempted}} to strike, with Sylvinho passing Hagi, and finding Henry, who in turn put in a cross for Keown, only for his shot to go over. Later throughout the match, Parlour sent a long ball into the Galatasaray midfield, but no Arsenal player was there to pick up the ball. A free-kick was given to Bergkamp after a foul on Overmars, which was cleared with a Popescu header. Galatasaray attempted an attack on the counter – Capone gave the ball to Hagi, who lost his balance while preparing to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot.</b> After receiving a pass, Hagi put in a wide cross for Şükür, but he was denied a shot on target after a clearance. Arsenal had another chance, when Henry snatched the ball from Korkmaz, and entered the penalty area, only to see his shot to go off target.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{began the}} match brightly and scored the first {{goal in the}} second minute. Stan Collymore, who {{received}} the ball from the left wing by Jamie Redknapp, produced a cross inside the penalty box for Robbie Fowler to head in at the far post and convert his 27th goal of the league season. Newcastle began to exert pressure on Liverpool and responded with an equaliser eight minutes later. Striker Faustino Asprilla swept past Neil Ruddock inside the right channel of the Liverpool box to pull the ball back and find Ferdinand. With one touch he gave himself room to swing his right foot and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> past goalkeeper David James. In the 14th minute, Newcastle were ahead. Ferdinand {{was involved in the}} buildup once again, releasing David Ginola on the left, who surged forward and scored his fifth goal of the league campaign. Liverpool threatened to score a second goal; Fowler missed close-by, Redknapp went close from long range and Steve McManaman mis-timed a header. Beardsley and David Batty were booked and Batty was shown a yellow card for a foul on McManaman. At the other end, Asprilla and Beardsley came close to scoring through a counterattack.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the third}} period Eric Staal tied the game at seven with his first goal of the game. Minutes later Duchene got a breakaway, but before he could <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot,</b> Ovechkin threw his stick at the puck, {{resulting}} in the first penalty shot in All-Star game history, and only the third penalty assessed during the past ten years of All-Star competition. Duchene took the shot against Henrik Lundqvist, who stopped the attempt. Kris Letang scored shortly after the penalty shot to give back the lead to Team Staal. Briere scored a little over a minute later assisted by Weber and Henrik Sedin to re-tie the game. Weber's assist was his fourth of the game making him the second defenceman in history to record four assists in an All-Star Game (Ray Bourque, 1985). Team Lidstrom added two more goals before Rick Nash scored to cut the deficit to one. With about {{a minute and a half}} left in the game, Team Staal pulled their goaltender for the extra attacker. The decision backfired as Eriksson scored on the empty net with 1:11 remaining. Eric Staal scored with 33.6 seconds remaining to bring his team back within one goal, but they failed to get another shot on goal before time ran out. By coming back from a four-goal deficit to win the game Team Lidstrom set the record for biggest comeback victory in All-Star history. Lidstrom finished the game with a +7 rating, the highest rating since 1991 when Adam Oates was also a +7 for the Wales Conference. Tim Thomas earned the victory becoming the first goaltender to win three straight All-Star Games. Patrick Sharp was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) after registering one goal and two assists in a losing cause for Team Staal. The combined 21 goals was the fourth highest total in NHL All-Star Game history.|$|E

5|$|Within {{a minute}} of Chelsea kicking off the match, Le Saux was booked for a {{challenge}} on Lauren. Arsenal were awarded the first corner {{of the game in}} the eight minutes later, but nothing came out of it as Adams fouled Mario Melchiot in the penalty box. The opening half-hour was mostly event-free, with neither side dominating and few goalscoring opportunities fashioned. Chelsea adopted a tactic of narrowing the pitch and using little width, which sedated Arsenal's typically fluent football. Guðjohnsen tested the Arsenal defence by making dangerous runs, but one in the 12th minute was ruled as a foul. Arsenal's first chance came a minute later when Henry used his pace to run towards the Chelsea goal. He set up Sylvain Wiltord, whose shot was blocked by Desailly. Vieira struggled to match the energetic performance of his opponent Frank Lampard and in the 17th minute Vieira's careless pass was intercepted by the England midfielder. Lampard decided to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot,</b> forcing a save from Seaman. Four minutes later Vieira started a move which almost gave Arsenal the lead. A ball over the top found Bergkamp in the Chelsea area, but he guided his header just wide. In the 26th minute Vieira was awarded the final's first yellow card for a foul on Guðjohnsen. A confrontation between Melchiot and Fredrik Ljungberg occurred in the 33rd minute, but referee Mike Riley decided not to brandish a card, instead choosing to have a few words with the players. Campbell's failed clearance a minute later presented Guðjohnsen with goal-scoring opportunity, but he hit his shot directly at Seaman. As the match drew nearer to half-time, Arsenal started to find their rhythm and played their usual passing game. They created the best chance of the first half, when a cross from Wiltord found Lauren, who headed the ball just over the crossbar. Hasselbaink, largely ineffective as he was blighted with injury, combined with Guðjohnsen to split open the Arsenal defence, but the move was halted as Riley called offside.|$|E
25|$|The {{style of}} the game is quick, {{accelerated}} by the close confines of the floor and a shot clock. The shot clock requires the attacking team to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> on goal within 30 seconds of gaining possession of the ball. In addition, players must advance the ball from their own defensive end to the offensive side of the floor within 10 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Penalties {{are awarded}} for major {{infringements}} or foul {{play and the}} team that receives them can choose to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> at goal {{in an attempt to}} score three points. They can also use the penalty to kick for territory or tap the ball and continue running it. Three points are awarded if a team member drop kicks a goal during general play.|$|E

25|$|As {{the series}} shifted back to Sacramento for Game 5, the Kings trailed {{almost the entire}} fourth quarter, but a jump shot by Bibby off a screen with 8.2 seconds left gave them the lead and was the game-winner in a 92-91 win. Bibby scored 23 in all, and Webber had 29 points and 13 rebounds in support. Bryant led L.A. with 30 points, but missed a {{potential}} game winner at the buzzer. O'Neal had 28 points, but did not <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> in the 4th quarter and fouled out.|$|E
25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E

25|$|At the 2002 Winter Olympics, {{having been}} {{selected}} by Gretzky to captain the roster, Lemieux led the Canadian men's team into Salt Lake City, United States. The team {{had failed to}} win a {{gold medal at the}} Olympics in fifty years but were still considered favourites to win. Lemieux was second to Joe Sakic in team scoring with six points in five games, and led the team to gold by defeating the United States 5-2 in the final game. Lemieux showcased his amazing hockey intelligence during the gold medal game against the United States. With Team Canada trailing 1-0 in the first period, Lemieux made {{one of the most famous}} and savvy plays in Olympic hockey history. After a cross-ice pass from Lemieux in the neutral zone, Canadian defenceman Chris Pronger carried the puck across the blue line into the American zone, and fired a pass across the zone. Lemieux then faked like he was receiving the pass and proceeded to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> at the net, all while letting the puck slide through his legs, knowing he had forward Paul Kariya streaking behind him. Lemieux's fake caused American goalie Mike Richter to lunge in Lemieux's direction, and thus created a wide open net for Kariya to fire the puck in, as he received the pass from Pronger after Lemieux let it go to Kariya. During the tournament, his hip injury required several painkilling injections to keep him on the ice, and he only played one more NHL game after the Olympics before being lost for the season.|$|E
25|$|The first {{significant}} action {{was a free}} won by Dublin's Barry Cahill in the second minute. Cahill called forward his goalkeeper Stephen Cluxton to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot.</b> Cluxton's attempt drifted {{to the left and}} wide. In the sixth minute Donegal's Christy Toye was hauled down by two Dublin players. Michael Murphy sent the resulting free wide. In the seventh minute Dublin's Alan Brogan shot spectacularly wide. A high challenge from Dublin's James McCarthy led to a yellow card in the eight minute. Colm McFadden scored the resulting free from inside the 45-metre line to give the opening point of the match to Donegal. In the tenth minute Dublin's Bernard Brogan ran through on the Donegal goal but his shot past Paul Durcan went to the left and wide. He made up for this two minutes later when he equalised by putting over Dublin's opening point from a free. The first 14 minutes of the match featured 12 frees. In the twenty-first minute Dublin's Bernard Brogan again attempted to score a point but his effort went to the right and wide. In the game's twenty-fourth minute Ryan Bradley restored Donegal's lead, evading the efforts of most of Dublin's players to send the ball between the posts and score the first point from play. One minute later, Bernard Brogan sent over a free to bring the game level again. In the twenty-ninth minute Kevin Cassidy sent Donegal into the lead again with a point from play via the outside of his boot. Colm McFadden added another point from play a minute later to send Donegal into a two-point lead for the first time. One minute after that, Alan Brogan sent another effort to the right and wide. Diarmuid Connolly and Cluxton added to Dublin's wide tally just before the break. Dublin did not score from play in the first half.|$|E
500|$|During play, teams may {{substitute}} {{players in}} and out freely. Sometimes this {{is referred to as}} [...] "on the fly" [...] substitution.

500|$|The saucer in the {{original}} game design was supposed to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> {{as soon as it}} appeared. This action was altered so there would be a delay before the saucer shoots, leading to [...] "lurking" [...] from players. Lurking is a strategy in which the player uses thrust to keep the ship in motion, leaves 1 or 2 asteroids undamaged, and hunts for saucers, allowing the player to pick off as many 1,000-point UFOs as possible and play indefinitely on a single credit. Since the saucer could only shoot directly at the player's position on the screen, the player could [...] "hide" [...] {{at the opposite end of}} the screen and shoot across the screen boundary, while remaining relatively safe. Complaints from operators losing revenue due to lurking led to the creation of an EPROM restricting such chances.

The result is a bitingly satiric and hugely entertaining parody." [...] It also has a Metacritic score of 81/100. Olly Richards of Empire praised the chemistry between Pegg and Frost, saying: [...] "After almost a decade together, they're clearly so comfortable in each other's presence that they feel no need {{to fight for the}} punchline, making them terrific company for two hours". Johnny Vaughan of The Sun already called it the [...] "most arresting Brit-com of 2007". Phillip French of The Observer, who did not care for Shaun of the Dead, warmed to the comedy team in this film. The film also received positive reviews in the United States. Derek Elley of Variety praised Broadbent and Dalton as [...] "especially good as Angel's hail-fellow-well-met superior and oily No. 1 suspect".
