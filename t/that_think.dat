The guitarist's absence also meant <b>that</b> <b>Think</b> Tank was almost entirely written by Albarn. Its sound {{was seen as a}} testament to Albarn's increasing interest in African and Middle Eastern music, and to his complete control over the group's creative direction. Think Tank was yet another UK number one and managed Blur's highest US position of number 56. It was also nominated for best album at the 2004 Brit Awards. The band did a successful tour in 2003, with former Verve guitarist Simon Tong filling in for Coxon.|$|E

25|$|At that time, {{rumors that}} Hansen would begin {{pursuing}} a vulnerable franchise {{to relocate to}} Seattle began making the rounds. Most of the discussion centered on the Sacramento Kings, a struggling franchise that {{had been trying to}} put together a plan to replace the aging Sleep Train Arena, then called the Power Balance Pavilion, for years with no luck. While Hansen had not spoken in public about his desires or pursuits for a specific team, the rumors were rampant enough <b>that</b> <b>Think</b> Big Sacramento, a community action group created by Sacramento mayor Kevin Johnson to develop solutions for the Kings, composed an open letter to Hansen asking him not to pursue the city's team. Meanwhile, negotiations between McGinn, Constantine, and Hansen continued on development of a memorandum of understanding that would lay out the relationship for a public-private partnership on the new arena.|$|E
25|$|The {{placebo effect}} {{is related to}} the {{perceptions}} and expectations of the patient; if the substance is viewed as helpful, it can heal, but, if it is viewed as harmful, it can cause negative effects, which is known as the nocebo effect. In 1985, Irving Kirsch hypothesized that placebo effects are produced by the self-fulfilling effects of response expectancies, in which the belief that one will feel different leads a person to actually feel different. According to this theory, the belief that one has received an active treatment can produce the subjective changes thought to be produced by the real treatment. Placebos can act similarly through classical conditioning, wherein a placebo and an actual stimulus are used simultaneously until the placebo is associated with the effect from the actual stimulus. Both conditioning and expectations play a role in placebo effect, and make different kinds of contribution. Conditioning has a longer-lasting effect, and can affect earlier stages of information processing. Those <b>that</b> <b>think</b> that a treatment will work display a stronger placebo effect than those that do not, as evidenced by a study of acupuncture.|$|E

500|$|While all {{advocates for}} {{elimination}} of Native mascots {{agree that the}} practice is morally wrong, many do not find a basis for legal remedy. Civil rights law in the United States reflect {{the difference between the}} experience of racism by African Americans and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The appropriation of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those <b>that</b> <b>think</b> of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular African Americans, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the [...] "noble savage" [...] honors Native Americans.|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} promotional interview, Nas {{claimed that the}} name [...] "Illmatic" [...] (meaning [...] "beyond ill" [...] or [...] "the ultimate") was a {{reference}} to his incarcerated Queensbridge friend, Illmatic Ice. Nas later described the title name as [...] "supreme ill. It's as ill as ill gets. That shit is a science of everything ill." [...] At {{the time of its}} recording, expectations in the hip hop scene were high for Illmatic. In a 1994 interview for The Source, which dubbed him [...] "the second coming", Nas spoke highly of the album, saying that [...] "this feels like a big project that's gonna affect the world [...] We in here on the down low [...] doing something for the world.

500|$|The {{success of}} the album, {{as well as its}} cleaner sound and the group's {{appearances}} on MTV, caused many longtime fans to accuse the band of [...] "selling out". Many commentators stated that the band's polished pop sound only remotely resembled punk music. Although the video for [...] "All the Small Things" [...] was filmed as a mockery of boy bands and teen pop, [...] "fame [...] discriminate based on origin: soon the group was as famous as those it was parodying." [...] "Blink now had the backing of a major record company... just like the synthesized pop acts they were spoofing," [...] said British journalist Tim Footman. [...] "In what way were they less 'pop' than Sugar Ray and 98 Degrees?" [...] Matt Diehl, author of the book My So-Called Punk, called the basis for satire thin: [...] "To seasoned ears, Blink-182 sounded and looked just as manufactured as the pop idols they were poking fun at." [...] The band faced a backlash shortly after Enema of the State was released from several punk and emo acts who wished to not be associated with their music. Tristin Laughter, employee of Bay Area record label Lookout! Records, wrote in an issue of the influential zine Punk Planet that the band would have a genuinely negative impact on punk and accused the band of misogyny. DeLonge responded to the accusations, commenting, [...] "I love all those criticisms, because fuck all those magazines! I hate with a passion Maximumrocknroll and all those zines <b>that</b> <b>think</b> they know what punk is supposed to be. I think it's so much more punk to piss people off than to conform to all those veganistic views". While ska veterans Blue Meanies tried to empathize ("I think they [...] are just trying to get in the mindset of a teenager, which means a lot of curiosity about sex,") others, such as John Lydon, frontman of the Sex Pistols and Public Image Ltd, dismissed the band as a [...] "bunch of silly boys... an imitation of a comedy act." ...|$|E
