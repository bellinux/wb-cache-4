Russell T Davies <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> idea to pick for a potential Christmas Special for 2009 to give to Phil Ford to write. Phil decided to use some aliens in the plot he was given and a chase down Buckingham Palace. But Russell decided that the better choice was 'Christmas on Mars' which then became The Waters of Mars.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Athens, of the 6th century BC, was {{the busy}} trade centre at the {{confluence}} of Egyptian, Mesopotamian and Minoan cultures {{at the height of}} Greek colonisation of the Mediterranean. The philosophical <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period ranged freely through many subjects. Empedocles (490430 BC) foreshadowed Darwinian evolutionary theory in a crude formulation of the mutability of species and natural selection. The physician Hippocrates (460370 BC) avoided the prevailing superstition of his day and approached healing by close observation and the test of experience. At this time a genuine non-anthropocentric curiosity about plants emerged. The major works written about plants extended beyond the description of their medicinal uses to the topics of plant geography, morphology, physiology, nutrition, growth and reproduction.|$|E

Participants were encouraged to share the first memory they <b>thought</b> <b>of.</b> <b>This</b> technique is consistent and reproducible under different conditions, such as using different participants or cue- words. There is a consistent peak of recalled memories within the reminiscence bump. However, different types of cue words, such as nouns and adjectives, elicited memories from different time periods and with different phenomenology.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{after the}} release of the American {{animation}} movie Kung Fu Panda, DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg and other DreamWorks members visited the city of Chengdu. In addition to seeing live pandas, crew members learned about the local culture. Katzenberg has stated that Kung Fu Panda 2 incorporates many elements of Chengdu in the film. The film's landscape and architecture also found inspiration from those found at Mount Qingcheng, a renowned Taoist mountain. In an interview with Movieline, Berger stated that ‘we never really <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> as a movie set in China for Americans; it's a movie set in a mythical, universalized China for everyone in the world'.|$|E
25|$|Following Simo Vuorilehto's {{appointment}} as CEO, a major restructuring was planned. With 11 {{groups within the}} company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. Nokian Tyres (Nokian Renkaat), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to UK-based International Computers Limited (ICL), the precursor of Fujitsu Siemens. Investors <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> as financial trouble and Nokia's stock price sunk as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its worst recession in living memory, {{and the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.|$|E

25|$|While {{referred}} to as social group work (Papell & Rothman,1966), Schwartz p{{referred to}} think of this model as social work with groups (Schwartz, 1976). Schwartz (1976) regarded this approach as resonant with the demands of a variety of group types including, natural and formed; therapeutic and task; open and closed; and voluntary and mandatory. Schwartz (1961, 1964) initially <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> approach as an organic systems model (as he viewed the group as an organic whole) later to refer to it as the mediating model and then the interactionist model (Schwartz, 1977). The model initially proposed by Schwartz has been further developed most notably by Lawrence Shulman and Alex Gitterman, who have since referred to this model as the Mutual Aid Model (Gitterman, 2004, 2005; Shulman, 1979, 1992, 1999, 2005b).|$|E
500|$|Existence {{resists the}} {{indifference}} {{of life and}} death, it lives beyond mechanical [...] "life," [...] it is always its own mourning, and its own joy. It becomes figure, image. It does not become alienated in images, but it is presented there: the images are the evidence of its existence, the objectivity of its assertion. This thought—which, for me, is the very <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> film —is a difficult thought, perhaps the most difficult. It's a slow thought, always under way, fraying a path so that the path itself becomes thought. It is that which frays images so that images become this thought, so that they become the evidence of this thought—and not in order to [...] "represent" [...] it.|$|E
500|$|As Magdalen's Dean of Divinity ("college chaplain" [...] in {{ordinary}} parlance), Lang had pastoral duties with the college's undergraduates {{and responsibility for}} the chapel and its choir. Lang was delighted with this latter obligation; his concern for {{the purity of the}} choir's sound led him to request that visitors [...] "join in the service silently". [...] In 1894 Lang was asked to add to his workload by acting as Vicar of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, where John Henry Newman had begun his Oxford ministry in 1828. The church had almost ceased to function when Lang took it over, but he revived regular services, chose preachers with care and slowly rebuilt the congregation. [...] In December 1895 he was offered the post of Vicar of Portsea, a large parish within Portsmouth on the south coast, but he was not ready to leave Oxford and refused. Some months later he had further thoughts; the strain of his dual appointment in Oxford was beginning to tell and, he claimed, [...] "the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> great parish [...] and work going a-begging troubled my conscience." [...] After discovering that the Portsea offer was still open, he decided to accept, though with some misgiving.|$|E

500|$|Matsuhara, {{who came}} up with the concept of the phone trigger system, stated that he {{initially}} wanted to incorporate the player's own mobile phone into the system. However, the idea was abandoned due to concerns that it might clash with Japan's privacy laws. When asked if the phone trigger system would be used in a possible sequel to the game, Hayashi stated that he hoped this would not be the case and recalled saying [...] "who <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> system!" [...] while writing the contents of the text messages. While Shitakura did not directly contribute to the script itself, Hayashi stated that Shitakura helped with the overall plot and provided assistance with the second half of the story. In particular, Shitakura helped a lot on the time traveling aspects of the story. Hayashi stated that while he did not want the script to repeat the same text over and over again, it was ultimately unavoidable due to the player having to travel back in time so he tried to place emphasis on the overall tempo of the plot's development and how the plot unfolded. With regards to the theme of time traveling, Hayashi had felt that it seemed like a topic that was overdone and expressed concern over it when he first heard the idea from Shikura.|$|E

2500|$|The {{symbolism}} of the scallop shell is multiple. Saint Augustine {{is said to have}} been walking along the seashore, meditating on the unfathomable mystery of the Holy Trinity. A boy was using a shell to pour sea water into a little hole. When Augustine asked him what he was doing, he replied, [...] "I am emptying the sea into this hole." [...] Thus did Augustine understand that man would never penetrate to the depths of the mystery of God. While a doctoral candidate in 1953, Fr. Joseph Ratzinger wrote his dissertation on The People of God and the House of God in Augustine's Teaching is always about the Church, and the shell therefore has a personal connection with the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> great Doctor of the Church.|$|E

2500|$|Nayral himself celebrated this {{collaborative}} process in his {{preface to the}} Cubist exhibition held at the Galerie Dalmau in Barcelona, April - May 1912 (the second Cubist manifestation held outside of Paris): 'You see a portrait in a landscape' wrote Nayral, 'is it simply the reproduction of some lines that permit our eye to recognize a head, clothes, trees? Photography would be sufficient'. Nayral answers the query: 'a thinking human {{in harmony with the}} surroundings, in accordance with them', one must 'reveal the concert of all these forms of life that are the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> man, the perfume of this flower, the brilliance of this plant, the vibration of this light, this is the task of the artist'. In essence, write Antliff and Leighten in Cubism and Culture, [...] "this synthetic vision was the product of Gleizes's sympathetic response to the expressive acts and physiognomic traits he deemed indicative of the poet's character. Both form and content in the work were the result of Gleizes's mental associations while working from memory.|$|E
