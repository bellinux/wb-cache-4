5000|$|There {{were lots}} of {{innovations}} from France in the late 18th century. With help from Jean-Baptiste de Belloy, the Archbishop of Paris, the idea that coffee should not be boiled gained acceptance. The first modern method for making coffee using a coffee filter—drip brewing—is more than 125 years old, and its design had changed little. The biggin, originating in France ca. 1780, was a two-level pot holding coffee in a cloth sock in an upper compartment into which water was poured, to drain through holes {{in the bottom of}} the compartment into the coffee pot below. Coffee was then dispensed from a spout on the side of the pot. The quality of the brewed coffee depended on the size of the grounds - too coarse and the coffee was weak; too fine and the water would not drip the filter. A major problem with this approach was that the <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cloth</b> <b>filter</b> - whether cotton, burlap or an old sock - transferred to the <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> the coffee. Around the same time, a French inventor developed the [...] "pumping percolator", in which boiling water in a bottom chamber forces itself up a tube and then trickles (percolates) through the ground coffee back into the bottom chamber. Among other French innovations, Count Rumford, an eccentric American scientist residing in Paris, developed a French Drip Pot with an insulating water jacket to keep the coffee hot. Also, the first metal filter was developed and patented by French inventor.|$|R

50|$|To {{extract the}} alginate, the seaweed is broken into pieces and stirred {{with a hot}} {{solution}} of an alkali, usually sodium carbonate. Over {{a period of about}} two hours, the alginate dissolves as sodium alginate to give a very thick slurry. This slurry also contains the part of the seaweed that does not dissolve, mainly cellulose. This insoluble residue must be removed from the solution. The solution is too thick (viscous) to be filtered and must be diluted with a very large quantity of water. After dilution, the solution is forced through a <b>filter</b> <b>cloth</b> in a <b>filter</b> press. However, the pieces of undissolved residue are very fine and can quickly clog the <b>filter</b> <b>cloth.</b> Therefore, before filtration is started, a filter aid, such as diatomaceous earth, must be added; this holds most of the fine particles away from the surface <b>of</b> the <b>filter</b> <b>cloth</b> and facilitates filtration. However, filter aid is expensive and can make a significant contribution to costs. To reduce the quantity <b>of</b> <b>filter</b> aid needed, some processors force air into the extract as it is being diluted with water (the extract and diluting water are mixed in an in-line mixer into which air is forced). Fine air bubbles attach themselves to the particles of residue. The diluted extract is left standing for several hours while the air rises to the top, taking the residue particles with it. This frothy mix of air and residue is removed from the top and the solution is withdrawn from the bottom and pumped to the filter.|$|R

40|$|The {{effluent}} treatment plant at Glencore Nikkelverk experiences the generation of liquid waste from various areas and processes in the plant. Being primarily a nickel refinery, but also producing copper and cobalt, the effluent contains significant concentrations of heavy metals. Such effluents are harmful to the environment. The {{effluent treatment}} plant thus operates to limit the discharge of harmful elements from the plant to the effluent, to allow the plant to comply to discharge limits set by authorities and to recover valuable elements from effluents for reprocessing. This is currently performed by means of metal hydroxide precipitation followed by solid-liquid separation. The solid-liquid separation is carried out by manual chamber filter presses that require heavy manual labour and have thus been classified as a health hazard by the health, safety and environment department. An investigation is therefore done to assess the suitability of DrM Fundabac candle filters as an alternative filtration technology by use of a DrM Fundabac pilot filter rig. The investigation analyses filtration performance while also exploring variations in general filtration behaviour. This is done by carrying out initial <b>filter</b> <b>cloth</b> screening tests in the laboratory to choose a suitable range <b>of</b> <b>filter</b> <b>cloths</b> for further testing. Filtration tests are then performed on the pilot filter, employing the chosen <b>filter</b> <b>cloths.</b> Operating parameters including filtration time, applied pressure and feed flowrate are evaluated. The feed to the filter varies continually and cannot be controlled. It is thus investigated how variations in feed affect variations in filtration {{in order to understand}} why filtration performance can change. Samples from the feed slurry, filtrate and filter cake are taken and analysed. Measurements from online data systems are recorded. These enable an overview of some of the primary particle properties, the state of the system and the secondary properties that together govern filtration. The study shows that the pilot filter operates effectively and through the use of either the DrM N 11 U 030 or Markert PPV 2737 <b>filter</b> <b>cloth,</b> good <b>filter</b> cake release and production of filtrate of equal clarity to that of the currently employed filter presses is enabled. For optimal throughput of filtrate and good cloth-cake adhesion during filtration, the filtration time should be set to at least 40 minutes and the applied pressure to 4 bar. An increase in the pH in the range of 9 to 10 during the precipitation process is beneficial for filtration as it results in a higher concentration of solids in the feed to the filter. Both an increase in the solution pH and an increase in the feed solids concentration result in a decreased specific cake resistance and decreased filter cake moisture content. An increase in the feed solids concentration also results in an increase in the mass <b>of</b> <b>filter</b> cake produced. Further information on the particle size distribution in the solution is required in order to conclude on its effect on filtration. An increased concentration of nickel hydroxide precipitate and a decreased concentration of iron hydroxide precipitate in the feed appear to result in a lower specific cake resistance. It is recommended that the study continues whereby the mentioned <b>filter</b> <b>cloths</b> are operated on for a longer duration of time while also investigating the benefit of setting an even longer filtration time. The next stage of investigation will be to design a full-scale filter such that potential candle filter performance can be evaluated and compared to chamber filter press performance...|$|R

In 2010 the WWTP was extended with post-denitrification and a discfilter plant for tertiary filtration of the effluent {{in order to meet}} the new discharge limits of 10 mg total nitrogen and 0. 3 mg/l of total phosphorus. The disc filters receive effluent from both the moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) and the secondary settlers. The disc filters are equipped with <b>filter</b> <b>cloths</b> with 15 ?m pore openings. The concentration of suspended solids was generally kept below 5 mg/l and total phosphorus was < 0. 2 mg/l for approximately 60 % of the days during the experimental period, with generally lower concentration of particles in the effluent from the disc filters during the summer. The mass load of suspended solids from the MBBR was higher compared to the load from the secondary settlers but this did not influence the concentration of suspended solids in the effluent from the disc filters. The particles in the MBBR effluent are larger and easier to filter compared to the secondary settler effluent which contain a larger number of small particles. During passage through the disc filters, some particles break-up leaving a larger number of particles (1 – 5 ?m) in the effluent. Due to their small mass, this does not affect the effluent suspended solids concentration significantly. The removal of indicator and pathogenic microorganisms was only marginal. Since the discfilter plant has been placed in operation, the operational strategies have improved (e. g. more frequent cleaning <b>of</b> the <b>filter</b> <b>cloths)</b> which has increased the treatment capacity.

As the filter cake becomes thicker, the filter resistance increases as well. So when the separating chamber is full, the filtration process is stopped as the optimum pressure difference is reached. The filtrate that passes through <b>filter</b> <b>cloth</b> is collected through collection pipes and stored in the filter tank. Filter cake (suspended solid) accumulation occurs at the hollow plate frame, then being separated at the filter plates by pulling the {{plate and frame filter}} press apart. The cakes then fall off from those plates and are discharged to the final collection point.|$|R

40|$|In {{the closed}} {{chemical}} recovery cycle in the sulphate pulp mill {{it is important}} to remove non-process elements. This is done by clarification of the green liquor, either in clarifiers or in filters. This project focuses on a cassette filter developed by Kvaerner Pulping AB. The cassette filter is semi-continuous and the aim of the project was to model the filter {{in order to be able}} to control cycle time and feed towards optimization of the capacity. The green liquor sludge forms a compressible filter cake when filtered. The model was built on the filter equation for compressible cake filtration and parameters such as <b>filter</b> <b>cloth</b> resistance, compressibility index and specific resistance in the cake were to be determined. The parameters were calculated by minimizing the difference between the calculated model and the measured data. Some simulation experiments were done to examine if optimization was possible. It turned out that the two parameters describing the green liquor (specific resistance in the cake and compressibility) were not identifiable from each other and the third parameter (resistance in the <b>filter</b> <b>cloth)</b> was also sometimes unidentifiable. The simulation experiments showed that the capacity <b>of</b> the cassette <b>filter</b> is hard to optimize during unfavourable conditions controlling only cycle time and feed. Proper actions might be to add lime mud or aluminium to increase the filterability of the green liquor sludge or to wash the filter socks to decrease the resistance in the <b>filter</b> <b>cloths...</b>|$|R
