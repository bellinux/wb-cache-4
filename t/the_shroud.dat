5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Shroud</b> Exhibit And Museum, {{located in}} White Sands Mall, showcases a {{full-sized}} back-lit photographic transparency of <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> of Turin, a religious relic believed {{by some to}} be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. They also feature a working VP8 Image Analyzer, {{the only one in the}} world where one can walk in and interact with this old analog computer. This town was founded the same year (1898) that Secundo Pia took the first photograph of <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> which started the modern investigation into <b>the</b> <b>Shroud.</b> This is highlighted in the museum. In 1977 in Albuquerque, they held the conference that resulted in the 1978 study of <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> with more scientists from New Mexico than any other state. The displayed photograph was created from the 1978 photographs made by Barrie M. Schwortz as part of <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> of Turin Research Project (STURP). The displays include historical background materials, scientific information, kiosks with a variety of information, videos available for viewing and an exhibit of electronic image analysis of <b>the</b> <b>shroud,</b> among other interesting artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{radiocarbon}} dating techniques date {{an object of}} popular interest, for example <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> of Turin, a piece of linen cloth thought by some to bear an image of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion. Three separate laboratories dated samples of linen from <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> in 1988; the results pointed to 14th-century origins, raising doubts about the shroud's authenticity as an alleged 1st-century relic.|$|E
5|$|Some relics, such as purported {{remnants}} of the Crown of Thorns, receive only a modest number of pilgrims, while <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> of Turin (which is associated with an approved Catholic devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus), has received millions, including popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI.|$|E

5|$|Kor (John Colicos), a revered Klingon warrior, is in Quark's Bar {{telling stories}} of past battles {{to his friend}} Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell). She notices Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) nearby and invites him to meet Kor, who greets Worf happily, saying that anyone who is so {{strongly}} disliked by the Klingon government {{is a friend of}} his. He explains to Jadzia and Worf that he is on the station as part of his plan to find the legendary Sword of Kahless. The sword is the original bat'leth, used by Kahless to defeat the tyrant Molor. Kor received a shroud from a Vulcan science team, which he believes once held the Sword. He gives it to Jadzia to test the shroud's authenticity. As he returns to his quarters, Kor is attacked by a Lethean who reads his thoughts in order to find out about the Sword and then removes his memories of the attack. Jadzia finds him the following morning, and thinks that he has passed out from too much alcohol. She has verified the authenticity of <b>the</b> <b>shroud.</b> Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) lends the trio a Runabout to travel into the Gamma Quadrant to search for the sword on a planet where the Vulcan team found <b>the</b> <b>shroud.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later, Black is {{informed}} that the girls are missing. She and Means search the woods, finding the girls in a grotto. They are with a teacher from the school, Ben Fisher (John Pyper-Ferguson) who attacks Means; she subdues him and he is arrested. She later confronts him, and it is revealed {{he is a former}} Group member charged with protecting the girls due to their powers. When Black later learns that Fisher has been released, she fears for McKenna's life. She rushes to the school, knowing the girls will be at a prayer meeting. She arrives just too late to prevent Alex from firing upon the meeting; Fisher is killed while shielding McKenna. Later, Means shows Black two sets of DNA test results—one from McKenna, the other from <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> of Turin. The profiles seem to prove that McKenna is related to Jesus Christ; Means entrusts them, and the decision as to whether to proliferate them, to Black.|$|E
5|$|The novel recaps Penelope's life in {{hindsight}} from 21st century Hades; she recalls her family life in Sparta, {{her marriage to}} Odysseus, her dealing with suitors during his absence, and the aftermath of Odysseus' return. The relationship with her parents was challenging: her father became overly affectionate after attempting to murder her, and her mother was absent-minded and negligent. At fifteen, Penelope married Odysseus, who had rigged the contest that decided which suitor would marry her. Penelope was happy with him, {{even though he was}} mocked behind his back by Helen and some maids for his short stature and lesser developed home, Ithaca. The couple broke with tradition by moving to the husband's kingdom. In Ithaca, neither Odysseus' mother Anticleia, nor his nurse Eurycleia, liked Penelope but eventually Eurycleia helped Penelope settle into her new role and became friendly, but often patronising. Shortly after the birth of their son, Telemachus, Odysseus was called to war, leaving Penelope to run the kingdom and raise Telemachus alone. News of the war and rumours of Odysseus' journey back sporadically reached Ithaca and with the growing possibility that Odysseus was not returning an increasing number of suitors moved in to court Penelope. Convinced the suitors were more interested in controlling her kingdom than loving her, she stalled them. The suitors pressured her by consuming and wasting much of the kingdom's resources. She feared violence if she outright denied their offer of marriage so she announced she would make her decision on which to marry once she finished her father-in-law's shroud. She enlisted twelve maids to help her unravel <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> at night and spy on the suitors. Odysseus eventually returned but in disguise. Penelope recognised him immediately and instructed her maids not to reveal his identity. After the suitors were massacred, Odysseus instructed Telemachus to execute the maids who he believed were in league with them. Twelve were hanged while Penelope slept. Afterwards, Penelope and Odysseus told each other stories of their time apart, but {{on the issue of the}} maids Penelope remained silent to avoid the appearance of sympathy for those already judged and condemned as traitors.|$|E

25|$|The {{details of}} the image on <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> are not easily seen with the naked eye, {{but they can be}} more clearly {{revealed}} through photography. In May 1898 Italian photographer Secondo Pia was allowed to photograph <b>the</b> <b>shroud.</b> He took the first photograph of <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> on 28 May 1898. Pia was startled by the visible image of the negative plate, implying that <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> is effectively a negative of some kind. Pia was at first accused of doctoring his photographs, but he was vindicated in 1931 when another photographer, Giuseppe Enrie, photographed <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> and obtained results similar to Pia's. In 1978, ultraviolet photographs were taken of <b>the</b> <b>shroud.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> from the 15th century is well recorded. In 1453 Margaret de Charny deeded <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> to the House of Savoy. In 1578 <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> was {{transferred}} to Turin. Since the 17th century <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> has been displayed (e.g. in the chapel built for that purpose by Guarino Guarini) and in the 19th century it was first photographed during a public exhibition.|$|E
25|$|After {{years of}} discussion, the Holy See {{permitted}} radiocarbon dating on portions of a swatch {{taken from a}} corner of <b>the</b> <b>shroud.</b> Independent tests in 1988 at the University of Oxford, the University of Arizona, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology concluded with 95% confidence that <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> material dated to 1260–1390 AD. This 13th to 14th century dating is much too recent for <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> to {{have been associated with}} Jesus of Nazareth. The dating does on the other hand match the first appearance of <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> in church history.|$|E

25|$|In 1976 {{physicist}} John P.

In 1978 this group, often called STURP, was given direct access to <b>the</b> <b>Shroud.</b>|$|E
25|$|Joe Nickell {{argues that}} results similar to Heller and Adler's could be {{obtained}} from tempera paint. Skeptics also cite other forensic blood tests whose results dispute the authenticity of <b>the</b> <b>Shroud,</b> and point {{to the possibility that}} the blood could belong to a person handling <b>the</b> <b>shroud,</b> and that the apparent blood flows on <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> are unrealistically neat.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Kohlbeck {{from the}} Hercules Aerospace Company in Utah and Richard Levi-Setti of the Enrico Fermi Institute {{examined}} some dirt particles from <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> surface. The dirt {{was found to}} be travertine aragonite limestone.

The chemical signatures of <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> samples and the tomb limestone were found identical except for minute fragments of cellulose linen fiber that could not be separated from <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> samples.|$|E

25|$|A fire, {{possibly}} {{caused by}} arson, threatened <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> on 11 April 1997. In 2002, the Holy See had <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> restored. The cloth backing and thirty patches were removed, {{making it possible}} to photograph and scan the reverse side of the cloth, which had been hidden from view. A faint part-image of the body was found on the back of <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Secondo Pia's 1898 {{photographs}} of <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> allowed {{the scientific community}} to begin to study it. A variety of scientific theories regarding <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> have since been proposed, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis. The scientific approaches {{to the study of}} <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> fall into three groups: material analysis (both chemical and historical), biology and medical forensics and image analysis.|$|E
25|$|Although pieces {{said to be}} of burial cloths of Jesus {{are held}} by at least four churches in France and three in Italy, none has {{gathered}} as much religious following as <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> of Turin. The religious beliefs and practices associated with <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> predate historical and scientific discussions and have continued in the 21st century, although the Catholic Church has never passed judgment on its authenticity. An example is the Holy Face Medal bearing the image from <b>the</b> <b>shroud,</b> worn by some Catholics. Indeed, <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> of Turin is respected by Christians of several traditions, including Baptists, Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Orthodox, Pentecostals, and Presbyterians.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Shroud</b> of Turin, a linen cloth that {{tradition}} associates with the crucifixion and burial of Jesus, has undergone numerous scientific tests, {{the most notable}} of which is radiocarbon dating, {{in an attempt to}} determine the relic's authenticity. In 1988, scientists at three separate laboratories dated samples from <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> to a range of 1260–1390 CE, which coincides with the first certain appearance of <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> in the 1350s and is much later than the burial of Jesus in 30 or 33 CE. Aspects of the 1988 test continue to be debated. Despite some technical concerns that have been raised about radiocarbon dating of <b>the</b> <b>Shroud,</b> most experts assert that such dating is reliable.|$|E
25|$|A {{currently}} familiar depiction {{is that on}} <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> of Turin, whose records go back to 1353. Controversy surrounds <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> and its exact origin remains {{subject to}} debate. <b>The</b> <b>Shroud</b> of Turin is respected by Christians of several traditions, including Baptists, Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Orthodox, Pentecostals, and Presbyterians. It {{is one of the}} Catholic devotions approved by the Holy See, that to the Holy Face of Jesus, now uses the image of the face on <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> as it appeared in the negative of the photograph taken by amateur photographer Secondo Pia in 1898. The image cannot be clearly seen on <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> itself with the naked eye, and it surprised Pia {{to the extent that he}} said he almost dropped and broke the photographic plate when he first saw the developed negative image on it in the evening of 28 May 1898.|$|E
25|$|According {{to the art}} {{historian}} Nicholas Allen, the image on <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> was formed by a photographic technique in the 13th century. Allen maintains that techniques already available before the 14th century—e.g., {{as described in the}} Book of Optics, which was at just that time translated from Arabic to Latin—were sufficient to produce primitive photographs, and that people familiar with these techniques {{would have been able to}} produce an image as found on <b>the</b> <b>shroud.</b> To demonstrate this, he successfully produced photographic images similar to <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> using only techniques and materials available at the time <b>the</b> <b>shroud</b> was supposedly made. He described his results in his PhD thesis, in papers published in several science journals, and in a book. Silver bromide is believed by some to have been used for making <b>the</b> <b>Shroud</b> of Turin as it is widely used in photographic films.|$|E
