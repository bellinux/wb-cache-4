2500|$|The first {{personal}} genome sequence to {{be determined}} was that of Craig Venter in 2007. [...] Personal genomes had not been sequenced in the public Human Genome Project to protect the identity of volunteers who provided DNA samples. That sequence {{was derived from the}} DNA of several volunteers from a diverse population. [...] However, early in the Venter-led Celera Genomics genome sequencing effort {{the decision was made to}} switch from sequencing a composite sample to using DNA from a single individual, later revealed to have been Venter himself. [...] Thus the Celera human genome sequence released in 2000 was largely that of one man. [...] Subsequent replacement of the early composite-derived data and determination of the diploid sequence, representing both sets of chromosomes, rather than a haploid sequence originally reported, allowed the release of the first personal genome. [...] In April 2008, that of James Watson was also completed. [...] Since then hundreds of personal genome sequences have been released, including those of Desmond Tutu, and of a Paleo-Eskimo. In November 2013, a Spanish family made their personal genomics data publicly available under a Creative Commons public domain license. The work was led by Manuel Corpas and <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> direct-to-consumer genetic testing with 23andMe and the Beijing Genomics Institute). This is believed to be the first such public genomics dataset for a whole family.|$|E
