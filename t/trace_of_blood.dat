60|$|He {{began to}} walk forward across the links to meet the boat, and I {{followed}} {{a step or two}} behind. In front of the pavilion I paused to see where Mr. Huddlestone had fallen; {{but there was no sign}} of him, nor so much as a <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sometimes a lone steer ranging the sod came {{suddenly}} upon a <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> Like a hound he paused, snuffling the earth. Then {{with wide}} mouth and outthrust, curling tongue, uttered voice. Wild as the tiger's food-sick cry, his warning roar burst forth, {{ending in a}} strange, upward explosive whine. Instantly every head in the herd was lifted, even the old cows heavy with milk stood as if suddenly renewing their youth, alert and watchful.|$|E

60|$|They stood side by side, looking mournfully at {{the little}} black hole made by Mr. Jones's bullet under the {{swelling}} breast of a dazzling and as it were sacred whiteness. It rose and fell slightly--so slightly that only {{the eyes of the}} lover could detect the faint stir of life. Heyst, calm and utterly unlike himself in the face, moving about noiselessly, prepared a wet cloth, and laid it on the insignificant wound, round which there was hardly a <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> to mar the charm, the fascination, of that mortal flesh.|$|E
6000|$|Maynard shuddered. Did she mean to kill herself, then, or ... or ... {{a horrible}} {{suspicion}} forced itself upon him. 'Dead--in the Rookery.' He hated {{himself for the}} thought that prompted him to draw the dagger from its sheath. No! there was no <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> and {{he was ready to}} kiss the good steel for its innocence. He thrust the weapon into his own pocket; he would restore it as soon as possible to its well-known place in the gallery. Yet, why had Caterina taken this dagger? What was it that had happened in the Rookery? Was it only a delirious vision of hers? ...|$|E
6000|$|The funeral obsequies were o'er, [...] But lingered {{still the}} Thane, Hanging around his home once more, [...] Feeding his bitter pain. The King would fain with {{friendly}} force Urge him anew to mount his horse, Turn from the piteous sight away, And fresh begin life's saddened day, His loved ones looking yet to greet, Where ne'er shall part the blest who meet. Just then {{a voice that}} well he knew, A sound that mixed the purr and mew, [...] Went to the father's heart. On a large stone King Alfred sat Against his buskin rubbed a cat, [...] Snow-white in every part, Though drenched and soiled from head to tail. The poor Thane's tears poured down like hail-- [...] "Poor puss, in vain thy loving wail," [...] Then came a joyful start! A little hand was on his cloak-- [...] "Father!" [...] a voice beside him spoke, [...] Emerging from the wood. All travel-stained, and marked with mire, With <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> and toil, and fire, Yet safe and sound beside his sire, [...] Edric before them stood. And as his father wept for joy, King Alfred blessed the rescued boy, [...] And thanked his Maker good! Who doth the captive's prayer fulfil, Making His creatures work His will [...] By means not understood.|$|E

50|$|Crime scene {{investigators}} use luminol to find <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> even {{if someone}} has cleaned or removed it. The investigator sprays a solution of luminol and the oxidant. The iron in blood catalyses the luminescence. The amount of catalyst necessary to cause the reaction is very small relative {{to the amount of}} luminol, allowing detection <b>of</b> even <b>trace</b> amounts <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> The blue glow lasts for about 30 seconds per application. Detecting the glow requires a fairly dark room. Any glow detected may be documented by a long-exposure photograph.|$|R
60|$|One marvellous fact, however, {{impressed}} {{them both}} with a vague {{sense of the}} unknown and the mysterious {{from the very first}} second. No spot nor <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> marred the body anywhere. And, even as they looked, a strange perfume, as of violets or of burning incense, began by degrees to flood the moor around them. Then slowly, while they watched, a faint blue flame seemed to issue from the wound in Bertram's right side and rise lambent into the air above the murdered body. Frida drew back and gazed at it, a weird thrill of mystery and unconscious hope beguiling for one moment her profound pang of bereavement. Monteith, too, stood away a pace or two, in doubt and surprise, the deep consciousness of some strange and unearthly power overawing for a while even his vulgar and commonplace Scotch bourgeois nature. Gradually, as they gazed, the pale blue flame, rising higher and higher, gathered force and volume, and the perfume as of violets became distinct on the air, like the savour of a purer life than this century wots of. Bit by bit, the wan blue light, flickering thicker and thicker, shaped itself into the form and features of a man, even the outward semblance of Bertram Ingledew. Shadowy, but transfigured with an ineffable glory, it hovered {{for a minute or two}} above the spot on the moor where the corpse had lain; for now they were aware that as the flame-shape formed, the body that lay dead upon the ground beneath dissolved by degrees and melted into it. Not a trace was left on the heath of Robert Monteith's crime: not a dapple of blood, not a clot of gore: only a pale blue flame and a persistent image represented the body that was once Bertram Ingledew's.|$|E
60|$|At all events, {{in quiet}} Campden, adventures {{obviously}} occurred to the unadventurous. They {{culminated in the}} following year, on August 16, 1660. Harrison left his house in the morning (?) and walked the two miles to Charringworth to collect his lady's rents. The autumn day closed in, and between eight and nine o'clock old Mrs. Harrison sent the servant, John Perry, to meet his master on the way home. Lights were also left burning in Harrison's window. That night neither master nor man returned, and it is odd that the younger Harrison, Edward, did not seek for his father till very early next morning: he had the convenience, for nocturnal search, of a moon which rose late. In the morning, Edward went out and met Perry, returning alone: he had not found his master. The pair walked to Ebrington, a village half way between Campden and Charringworth, and learned that Harrison had called, on the previous evening, as he moved home through Ebrington, {{at the house of}} one Daniel. The hour is not given, but Harrison certainly disappeared when just beyond Ebrington, within {{less than a mile from}} Campden. Edward and Perry next heard that a poor woman had picked up on the highway, beyond Ebrington, near some whins or furze, a hat, band, and comb, which were Harrison's; they were found within about half a mile of his own house. The band was bloody, the hat and comb were hacked and cut. Please observe the precise words of Sir Thomas Overbury, the justice who took the preliminary examinations: 'The Hat and Comb being hacked and cut, and the Band bloody, but nothing more could there be found.' Therefore the hat and comb were not on Harrison's head when they were hacked and cut: otherwise they must have been blood-stained; the band worn about the throat was bloody, but there was no <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> on the road. This passage contains the key to the puzzle.|$|E

25|$|Such {{a stance}} <b>of</b> {{dividing}} <b>blood</b> into major components and minor fractions rather than either accepting all blood or requiring all blood components {{to be poured}} out onto the ground has led to criticism from {{organizations such as the}} Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood. Witnesses respond that blood as the fluid per se is not the real issue. They say the real issue is respect and obedience regarding blood, which they perceive as being God's personal property. Members are allowed to eat meat that still contains small <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> remaining. Once blood is drained from an animal, the respect has been shown to God and then a person can eat the meat. Jehovah's Witnesses view <b>of</b> meat and <b>blood</b> is therefore different from the Jewish view that goes to great lengths to remove even minor <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b>|$|R

The coroner's report states that the amount of force required to do this would have left bruises on her neck - no such marks were found. Instead, there were marks from a cloth being wrapped tightly around her neck.|$|E
5000|$|Amédée Fengarol (30 March 1905 in Capesterre-Belle-Eau [...] - [...] 11 January 1951 in Pointe-à-Pitre) was a Guadeloupean politician.

The cause of death was contested, the communist party and L'Étincelle continued for years to maintain he was assassinated, yet other witnesses confirm no <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> on his shirt and that he may have died of natural causes. In either case the accusation of foul play continued to destabilise the socialist government of Paul Valentino who had succeeded in getting himself reelected as mayor.|$|E

50|$|The {{choice of}} imaging {{depends on the}} {{clinical}} presentation (history, symptoms and examination findings). In the case of renal colic (one sided loin pain usually accompanied by a <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> in the urine) the initial investigation is usually a spiral or helical CT scan. This {{has the advantage of}} showing whether there is any obstruction of flow of urine causing hydronephrosis as well as demonstrating the function of the other kidney. Many stones are not visible on plain X-ray or IVU but 99% of stones are visible on CT and therefore CT is becoming a common choice of initial investigation. CT is not used however, when there is a reason to avoid radiation exposure, e.g. in pregnancy.|$|E

When Hellboy asks where Giurescu is, the man refuses to tell him and Hellboy burns him to death. When Hellboy leaves the room he remembers the old man said {{something}} about a moon door and sees a door with a moon shape on it, and inside is the box with his corpse in and the three soldier's heads in front of it. But he is surrounded by ravens who turn into the Women of Thessaly and start attacking him.|$|E
50|$|Forensic {{examination}} {{of the crime scene}} had revealed that Julia Wallace's attacker was likely to have been heavily contaminated with her blood, given the brutal and frenzied nature of the assault. Wallace's suit, which he had been wearing {{on the night of the}} murder, was examined closely but no trace of bloodstaining was found. The police formed the theory that a mackintosh, which was inexplicably found under Julia's corpse, had been used by a naked Wallace to shield himself from blood spatter while committing the crime. Examination of the bath and drains revealed that they had not been recently used, and there was no <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> there either, apart from a single tiny clot in the toilet pan, the origin of which could not be established.|$|E

50|$|The Police {{discovered}} that the telephone call had been made from a public call box only 400 yards from Wallace's home, and hypothesised that Wallace had made the call himself to create an elaborate alibi, and had in fact murdered his wife before leaving his house the following evening. However, no <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> was found on Wallace, although the killer would have been heavily bloodstained, and a milk-boy's testimony of seeing Mrs. Wallace alive sometime between 6.30pm and 6.45pm left Wallace scarcely enough time to kill his wife, clean himself up, and stage a robbery before catching his tram. The murder-weapon was not found, and no motive could be ascribed to Wallace in killing his wife. On the contrary, Wallace, 52, was in poor health, {{and his wife had}} fulfilled the role of companion and sometime nurse. They had been married 17 years and had no children.|$|E
5000|$|Unsure of his fealty, Katagiri {{approaches}} Hori {{with his}} treachery, {{to which he}} crudely admits. Realizing that the Hazamas were victims of a corrupt system, Katagiri avenges them both by stabbing Hori in the heart with a thin blade (the technique known as “the hidden blade” which leaves almost no <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> (in the original Japanese version the technique is actually called [...] "the demon's claw/scratch", the wound was so small {{it appeared to be}} caused by nonhuman sources) [...] ). Katagiri buries the blade at the Hazama’s grave as a form of atonement and relinquishes his samurai status. Resolved to become a tradesman, he leaves the village for the island of Ezo (modern day Hokkaido), but not before seeing Kie. With custom no longer a breach, Katagiri proposes marriage and Kie accepts. The film ends with them sitting on a hill holding hands, pondering a future together.|$|E
5000|$|The curse {{could only}} be lifted when all eight hundred and eighty two coins were {{returned}} to the chest along with a <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> from each pirate who stole one. William [...] "Bootstrap Bill" [...] Turner Sr., the only crew member who defended Jack during the mutiny, sent a coin to his young son Will Turner, believing the crew deserved to remain cursed. Barbossa, as Pintel put it, [...] "strapped a cannon to old Bootstrap's bootstraps and the last we saw of old Bill Turner, he was sinking to the crushing black oblivion of Davy Jones' locker" [...] in retaliation. He later {{struck a deal with}} Davy Jones for one hundred years of service on the Flying Dutchman. Only then did they learn they also needed Bootstrap's blood to break the curse, and by throwing him overboard they had, in fact, doomed themselves to continued damnation. Over the next decade, the Pearl menaced the Caribbean as the pirates searched for the coins until all but one was found. As a boy, Will Turner Jr. brought the gold medallion with him on his journey to the Caribbean, although Elizabeth Swann, the governor's daughter, came into possession of it and kept it hidden for eight years. The Pearl later attacked Port Royal and abducted Elizabeth, believing she was Bootstrap's child—their only remaining source of Turner blood when it was really Will.|$|E
60|$|The {{three men}} left {{the bar and}} the crowd sifted through the doors in to the laneway. The manager brought the constable to the stairs to inspect {{the scene of the}} accident.

40|$|Background: More than 200 {{different}} diseases may {{be transmitted}} {{from exposure to}} blood in the dental setting. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify possible faults in the cross-contamination chain control in a dental school clinic searching for <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> in the clinical contact surfaces (CCS) through forensic luminol <b>blood</b> test. Methods: <b>Traces</b> <b>of</b> invisible <b>blood</b> where randomly searched in CCS of one dental school clinic. Results: Forty eight surfaces areas in the CCS were tested and the presence of invisible and remnant blood was identified in 28 (58. 3 %) items. Conclusions: We suggest that the luminol method is suitable for identifying contamination with invisible blood traces and this method may be a useful tool to prevent cross-contamination in the dental care setting...|$|R
