5|$|The film starred Roekiah, Rd Djoemala, Kartolo, and Annie Landouw and {{featured}} Titing, Ismail, and Ramli. Roekiah had regularly been paired on-screen with Rd. Mochtar– {{despite being}} married to Kartolo– beginning with Terang Boelan. In 1938 the three had come to Tan's, where <b>they</b> <b>acted</b> together in three films beginning with Fatima. However, after a wage dispute following Siti Akbari (1940), Mochtar left the company. To replace him, Tan's hired the tailor Djoemala as Roekiah's romantic foil. Sorga Ka Toedjoe was their first film together.|$|E

5|$|After the film's {{commercial}} success, Roekiah, Kartolo, {{and most}} of the cast and crew of Terang Boelan were signed to Tan's Film, first appearing for the company in their 1938 production Fatima. <b>They</b> <b>acted</b> together in two more films before Mochtar left the company in 1940; through these films, Roekiah and Mochtar became the colony's first on-screen couple. Mochtar's replacement, Rd Djoemala, acted with Roekiah in four films, although these were less successful. After the Japanese invaded the Indies in 1942, Roekiah took only one more film role before her death; most of her time was used entertaining Japanese forces.|$|E
5|$|Mírzá Husayn `Alí Núrí {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{followers}} of the Báb, and later took the title of Bahá'u'lláh. Bábís faced a period of persecution that peaked in 1852-53 after a few individuals made a failed attempt to assassinate the Shah. Although <b>they</b> <b>acted</b> alone, the government responded with collective punishment, killing many Bábís. Bahá'u'lláh was put in prison. He claimed that in 1853, while incarcerated in the dungeon of the Síyáh-Chál in Tehran, he received the first intimations that he was the one anticipated by the Báb when he received a visit from the Maid of Heaven.|$|E

With {{the collapse of the}} Vichy French government, troops of the FFI took over and resumed control of the French political institutions.

5|$|The Haymarket affair (also {{known as}} the Haymarket {{massacre}} or Haymarket riot) was {{the aftermath of a}} bombing that took place at a labor demonstration on Tuesday May 4, 1886, at Haymarket Square in Chicago. It began as a peaceful rally in support of workers striking for an eight-hour day and in reaction to the killing of several workers the previous day by the police. An unknown person threw a dynamite bomb at police as <b>they</b> <b>acted</b> to disperse the public meeting. The bomb blast and ensuing gunfire resulted in the deaths of seven police officers and at least four civilians; scores of others were wounded.|$|E

5|$|During the Principate {{period of}} the Roman Empire (30 BC – AD 284), the all-mounted alae ("wings") {{contained}} the elite cavalry of the army. They were specially trained in elaborate manoeuvres, such as those displayed to the emperor Hadrian during a documented inspection in Numidia. They were best-suited for large-scale operations and battle, during which <b>they</b> <b>acted</b> as the primary cavalry escort for the legions, which had almost no cavalry of their own. Roman alares were normally armoured, with mail or scale body armour, a cavalry version of the infantry helmet (with more protective features, such as completely covered ears) and oval shield or hexagonal. Their weapons could be a lance, javelins, or bow and arrow but all Roman horseman had a sword called a (spatha) and the ubiquitous pugio. The elite status of an alaris is shown {{by the fact that}} he received 20% greater pay than his counterpart in an auxiliary cohort, and than a legionary infantryman.|$|E
5|$|Coke {{used his}} role in Parliament as a leading {{opposition}} MP to attack patents, a system he had already criticised as a judge. Historically, English patent law was based on custom and the common law, not on statute. It began as the Crown granted patents {{as a form of}} economic protection to ensure high industrial production. As gifts from the Crown, there was no judicial review, oversight or consideration, and no actual law concerning patents. To boost England's economy, Edward II began encouraging foreign workmen and inventors to settle in England, offering letters of protection that protected them from guild policy on the condition that they train English apprentices and pass on their knowledge. The letters did not grant a full monopoly; rather <b>they</b> <b>acted</b> as a passport, allowing foreign workers to travel to England and practice their trade. This process continued for three centuries, with formal procedures set out in 1561 to issue letters patent to any new industry, allowing monopolies. The granting of these patents was highly popular with the monarch because of the potential for raising revenue; a patentee was expected to pay heavily for the patent, and unlike a tax raise (another method of raising Crown money) any public unrest {{as a result of the}} patent was normally directed at the patentee, not the monarch.|$|E
5|$|From {{the reign}} of David I, there are records of burghs (a Germanic word for a fortress), towns that were granted certain legal {{privileges}} by the crown. Most of the burghs granted charters during David's reign probably already existed as settlements. Charters were copied almost verbatim from those used in England, and early burgesses were usually English or Flemish. They were able to impose tolls and fines on traders within a region outside their settlements. Most of the early burghs were on the east coast. Among them were the largest and wealthiest, including Aberdeen, Berwick, Perth and Edinburgh, whose growth was facilitated by trade with the continent. In the south-west Glasgow, Ayr and Kirkcudbright benefited from the less profitable sea trade with Ireland, {{and to a lesser}} extent France and Spain. Burghs were typically surrounded by a palisade or had a castle and usually a market place, with a widened high street or junction, often marked by a mercat cross beside which were houses for the burgesses and other inhabitants. Around 15 burghs can be traced to {{the reign of}} David I, and there is evidence of 55 by 1296. In addition to the major royal burghs, the late Middle Ages saw the proliferation of baronial and ecclesiastical burghs; 51 were created between 1450 and 1516. Most were much smaller than their royal counterparts, and excluded from international trade <b>they</b> <b>acted</b> mainly as local markets and centres of craftsmanship.|$|E

Meanwhile, Skinner tries to deal directly with The Smoking Man for Scully's life, who tells him he will get back to him. Inside the facility, Mulder discovers that Dr. Scanlon works alongside several clones of Kurt Crawford. The clones show him Scully's harvested ova and tell him they are trying to save the abducted women's lives, since <b>they</b> <b>acted</b> as their birth mothers. They also hope to subvert the colonization project as an inside job. Mulder takes Scully's ova and leaves, being pursued by the Gray-Haired Man as he escapes. He returns to the hospital to see Scully, who tells him that Penny has died but that she intends to fight the disease. Afterward, Mulder phones Skinner for letting him know Scully's doing ok and may return to work soon, as well as for thanking him for his advice about not negotiating with the Smoking Man, after which Skinner and the Smoking Man come to terms on their deal in seclusion.|$|E
