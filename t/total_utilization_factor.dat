The commercial success of these products greatly depends on the duration of the battery support. In order to consume minimal energy during power-up, sleep, idle and underloaded conditions, many Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) techniques have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a technique based on the resource reservation paradigm. The paradigm is extended to cope with shared resources and critical sections. The bandwidth reserved to each task is controlled by means of a predictor and a feedback algorithm.

The effectiveness of two distinct types of sharing strategies, referred to as spectrum division and orbit division, is determined for various deployments of selected baseline systems representing the two services and for various combinations of sharing tactics such as frequency interleaving, crossed-polarization operation, and crossed-beam operation. Effectiveness {{is measured by the}} 'utilization factor', defined as the number of channels provided by the baseline systems when using an assigned share of the orbit-spectrum resource, relative to what they could provide if given the entire resource. Computer simulation is used to verify the intra- and interservice interference compatibility of the assumed deployments.

The purpose of this report is to provide detailed evaluations and comparisons of these two frameworks. These two frameworks share some similar characteristics, but they are useful for different application cases. These two frameworks together provide comprehensive means for the users to automatically convert the pseudo polynomial-time tests (or even exponential-time tests) into polynomial-time tests with closed mathematical forms. With the quadratic and hyperbolic forms, k 2 Q and k 2 U frameworks {{can be used to}} provide many quantitive features to be measured and evaluated, like the <b>total</b> <b>utilization</b> bounds, speed-up <b>factors,</b> etc., not only for uniprocessor scheduling but also for multiprocessor scheduling. These frameworks can be viewed as "blackbox" interfaces for providing polynomial-time schedulability tests and response time analysis for real-time applications. We have already presented their advantages for being applied in some models in the previous papers. However, {{it was not possible to}} present a more comprehensive comparison between these two frameworks. We hope this report can help the readers and users clearly understand the difference of these two frameworks, their unique characteristics, and their advantages. We demonstrate their differences and properties by using the traditional sporadic realtime task models in uniprocessor scheduling and multiprocessor global scheduling.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Hot {{engine exhaust}} and {{industrial}} process exhaust represents a resource {{that is often}} rejected to the environment without further utilization. This resource is prevalent in the transportation and industrial process sectors, but stationary engine-generator systems also typically do not utilize this resource. Engine exhaust is considered high grade heat and can potentially be utilized by various approaches to produce electricity or to drive heating and cooling systems. This thesis describes {{a model system that}} employs thermoelectric conversion as a topping cycle integrated with an organic Rankine bottoming cycle for waste heat utilization. This approach is being developed to fully utilize the thermal energy contained in hot exhaust streams. This thesis investigates several system configurations each composed of a high temperature heat exchanger which extracts thermal energy for driving the thermoelectric conversion elements and a closely integrated bottoming cycle to capture the large amount of remaining thermal energy in the exhaust stream. The models differ by how they arrange specific heat exchangers in the system. Many interacting parameters that define combined system operation are employed in the models to determine overall system performance including output power, efficiency, and <b>total</b> energy <b>utilization</b> <b>factors.</b> In addition, the model identifies a maximum power operating point for the combined system. That is, the model can identify the optimal amount of heat to remove from the exhaust flow to drive the thermoelectric elements for maximizing the combined cycle output. The model has been developed such that the impact of heat exchanger UA[subscript h] values, thermal resistances, and the thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT) can be investigated in the context of system operation. The model also has the ability to simultaneously determine the effect of each cycle design parameter on the performance of the overall system, thus giving the ability to utilize as much waste heat as possible. Key analysis results are presented showing the impact of critical design parameters on power output, system performance and inter-relationships between design parameters in governing performance...|$|R

40|$|To {{deal with}} a large variety of workloads in {{different}} application domains in real-time embedded systems, a number of expressive task models have been developed. For each individual task model, researchers tend to develop different types of techniques for deriving schedulability tests with different computation complexity and performance. In this paper, we present a general schedulability analysis framework, namely the k 2 U framework, that can be potentially applied to analyze a large set of real-time task models under any fixed-priority scheduling algorithm, on both uniprocessor and multiprocessor scheduling. The key to k 2 U is a k-point effective schedulability test, which {{can be viewed as}} a "blackbox" interface. For any task model, if a corresponding k-point effective schedulability test can be constructed, then a sufficient utilization-based test can be automatically derived. We show the generality of k 2 U by applying it to different task models, which results in new and improved tests compared to the state-of-the-art. Analogously, a similar concept by testing only k points with a different formulation has been studied by us in another framework, called k 2 Q, which provides quadratic bounds or utilization bounds based on a different formulation of schedulability test. With the quadratic and hyperbolic forms, k 2 Q and k 2 U frameworks can be used to provide many quantitive features to be measured, like the <b>total</b> <b>utilization</b> bounds, speed-up <b>factors,</b> etc., not only for uniprocessor scheduling but also for multiprocessor scheduling.

In addition, the lightning impulse breakdown level considering <b>utilization</b> <b>factors</b> are studied for the establishment of insulation design criteria of high voltage power equipment. The <b>utilization</b> <b>factors</b> are represented as the ratio of minimum electric field (Emin) to maximum electric filed (Emax).

Where, sphere-sphere electrode configuration require higher U 50 to breakdown it is 40 % than rod-sphere electrode configuration (30 %) and rod-rod electrode configuration (28 %), respectively. A difference in Emax values where the higher gap length provide lower Emax for sphere-sphere electrode configuration, while the higher gap length provide higher Emax for rod-rod and rod-sphere electrode configurations.

40|$|Abstract. The earliest-pseudo-deadline-first (EPDF) {{algorithm}} is {{less expensive than}} other known Pfair algorithms, but is not optimal for scheduling recurrent real-time tasks on more than two processors. Prior work established sufficient per-task weight (i. e., utilization) restrictions that ensure that tasks either do not miss their deadlines or have bounded tardiness when scheduled under EPDF. Im-plicit in these restrictions {{is the assumption that}} <b>total</b> system <b>utilization</b> may equal the total available processing capacity (i. e., the total number of processors). This paper considers an orthogonal issue — that of determining a sufficient restriction on the <b>total</b> <b>utilization</b> of a task set for it to be schedulable under EPDF, assuming that there are no per-task weight restrictions. We prove that a task set with <b>total</b> <b>utilization</b> at most 3 M+ 1 4 is correctly scheduled under EPDF on M processors, regardless of how large each task’s weight is. At present, we do not know whether this bound is tight. However, we provide a conterexample that shows that it cannot be improved to exceed 86 % of the total processing capacity. Our schedulability test is expressed in terms of the maximum weight of any task, and hence, if this value is known, may be used to schedule task sets with <b>total</b> <b>utilization</b> greater than 3 M+ 1...|$|R
