5|$|Before the 2009 season, Fredrikstad told Tegström {{that he was}} {{not part}} of the club's {{long-term}} plans and that he was welcome to find another club. Fredrikstad turned down an offer from Stabæk to buy the striker. He did not start a single match in the pre-season, but he came on as a substitute and scored a goal against Strømsgodset in the second match of the 2009 season. Tegström spent most of the 2009 season on the bench, but in the 2009 Norwegian Football Cup tie against Ranheim, he came on as a substitute and scored two goals in <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

5|$|Fox {{ran with}} an unusual gait, as he was {{required}} to hop-step on his good leg due to <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>time</b> the springs in his artificial leg required to reset after each step. He found the training painful as the additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises, blisters and intense pain. Fox found that after about 20minutes of each run, he crossed a pain threshold and the run became easier.|$|E
5|$|Having {{personal}} experience with worker safety concerns, Lynch found himself with aspirations beyond his trade. When a 1979 blizzard forced his project in Wisconsin to shut down, he spent <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>time</b> taking courses at the University of Wisconsin. Shortly thereafter, his father was diagnosed with cancer, and so Lynch returned to Boston. In the early 1980s Lynch {{was elected to the}} executive board of the Iron Workers Local 7 union. At age 30 he was elected president of the board, the youngest in the local's history. During this time he spent his nights and weekends attending the Wentworth Institute of Technology, from which he graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in construction management in 1988.|$|E
5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first Apollo mission as a joint space rendezvous with the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>time</b> needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E

5|$|Jameson did {{not regard}} this {{ambiguity}} as a proper answer, and impatiently waited for further {{word from the}} king. After standing by for the specified two days and receiving nothing, he correctly concluded that Lobengula was stalling him, and using <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>time</b> {{to distance himself from}} his former capital. Jameson therefore made good on his pledge, and called for volunteers; he assembled a host of about 470 men, mixed together from the Mashonaland Mounted Police, the Bechuanaland Border Police, and Raaff's Rangers, an independent unit led by the eponymous Commandant Piet Raaff. This force was placed under Forbes's command, with three Maxim guns attached. Jameson told the major to scout the area between Shiloh and Inyati for spoor, with the ultimate objective of capturing Lobengula, and sent him out just before sunset on 14 November 1893.|$|E
5|$|Kameo {{is known}} for its {{prolonged}} development cycle, which spanned four Nintendo and Microsoft consoles. It was conceived as a Pokémon-style game of capturing and nurturing monsters, but traded its lighthearted Nintendo overtones for darker themes more befitting of Xbox audiences when Microsoft acquired the developer. In this process, Kameo was repurposed from a fairy to an elf—a transition the game's director later concluded was unsuccessful. While nearly finished for the original Xbox console, the title was delayed to become an exclusive launch title for the upcoming Xbox 360. Rare used <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>time</b> to improve the game's audiovisuals, including Rare's first orchestral soundtrack, and add a local cooperative multiplayer mode. Kameo released alongside the Xbox 360 launches: November 2005 in North America and several weeks later in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, {{the company}} {{collected}} NOK3.07 million in tolls, 21% more than estimated. By 1977, the annual income had reached NOK5.03 million, which was up 28% from the estimates. From 1978, the tolls for people were removed, resulting in about NOK1 million less revenue per year. One {{of the reasons}} for the removal of passenger tolls was <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>time</b> used to count passengers, which increased the queues at the toll plaza, and that the company's debt would be covered anyway, even without the extra revenue. From 1 January 1981, scheduled buses were also exempt from tolls, under the condition that the funds saved were used by the bus companies to strengthen public transport on Sotra. From 1980, there was disagreement within the company as to whether the toll period should be extended to increase the subsidies to projects on Sotra and Øygarden, or if an as short as possible collection period was desirable. The board decided to terminate toll collections from 31 December 1983. A minority of the owners wanted to extend the period for another two years, which would have given an estimated additional NOK20 million.|$|E

25|$|Three {{championship}} {{titles are}} disputed in UAAP football, {{one for each}} division, namely the men's, women's and juniors. The tournament is a double round robin elimination. A Team that sweeps both rounds automatically wins the championship. Otherwise, the number one and two ranked teams meet in the Finals round with the former having a twice-to-beat advantage over the number two team. Games in the Finals go into extra time if the score is a draw {{at the end of}} Regulation Time. <b>The</b> <b>extra</b> <b>time</b> consists of two 15-minute periods. If there is still no winner after <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>time,</b> then the game will go to a penalty shootout (free kick) to decide the winner.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time in an {{international}} football tournament, the silver goal system was applied, whereby the team that led the game at the half-time break during <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>time</b> period would be declared the winner. If the scores were still level after the initial 15 minutes of extra time, play would continue for a further 15 minutes. If the teams could still not be separated after <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>time,</b> there would be a penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each) to determine which team progressed to the next round. The silver goal replaced the golden goal from the previous two championships and was used in the semi final between Greece and the Czech Republic.|$|E
