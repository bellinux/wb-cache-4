There are some conditions in which the external price includes only {{the value of the}} merchandise and other conditions in which, besides the value of the merchandise, the price includes also the external transport and insurance. In the case of the exports on commercial credit, when it appears the notion of external interest, this one may be included in the price or may be <b>invoiced</b> <b>separately,</b> thus defining gross external prices and net external prices...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} theory of optimal {{currency}} basket in a small open economy general equilibrium model with sticky prices. In contrast to existing literature, we focus on an economy with vertical trade, where the currencies in the basket may play different roles in invoicing trade flow. In a simple two-currency basket, one currency is used <b>to</b> <b>invoice</b> imported intermediate goods and is called "import currency", while the other currency is used <b>to</b> <b>invoice</b> exported finished goods and is called "export currency" We find that the optimal weights of the import currency and the export currency depends critically {{on the structure of}} vertical trade. Moreover, if a country decides to choose a single-currency peg, the choice of pegging currency also depends on how other competing economies respond to external exchange rate fluctuations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Since many {{developed}} countries have started <b>to</b> <b>invoice</b> their exports not only in American dollars but also in their own currencies, new models have been developed in international macroeconomics literature to show under which conditions exporting firms choose the currency <b>to</b> <b>invoice</b> their exports and to know {{what are the implications}} of those decisions on optimal monetary policy. In this paper, I use the second order approximation method of the policy function for solving Stochastic Dynamic General Equilibrium models to show two important results. First, gains from monetary policy cooperation are different from zero when the elasticity of substitution between domestic and imported goods consumption is different from one. Second, when monetary policy is endogenous in a two-country model, the only Nash equilibria supported by this model are those that are symmetric. That is all exporting firms in both countries choose to price in their own currency or all exporting firms in both countries choose to price in the importer’s currency.

50|$|Customers {{with lower}} water demand may draw {{insignificant}} amounts without becoming a formal member. In cases of water shortage {{they have to}} renounce the supply {{for the benefit of}} the regular members. The need of service water varies very much - for example annually for a public pool 500 m³/year up to 15 Mio. m³/year for a thermal power station. All together the withdrawal is on the average 60 Mio. m³/year (with downward drift). The technically possible maximum of 400 Mio. m³/year has never been used. The discharge of canal water via the Stever into Halterner Stausee and Talsperre Hullern depends on the annual rainfall, for example the discharge in 1976 was 11.5 Mio. m³ but in “wet years” nothing is discharged.The withdrawal of service water that is used and has to be treated separately and discharged as waste water is invoiced with 0,0353 €/m³ (waste water is <b>invoiced</b> <b>separately</b> by the operator of the wastewater treatment facility). For water that has been removed, warmed-up and discharged again into the canal the invoice value is 3.3% of that amount. The fees cover the costs that appear from operation and maintenance of the pumping stations and other costs related to the water services.|$|R
