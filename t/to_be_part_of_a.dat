5|$|Although the A303 as a {{whole is}} {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> route from London to Exeter, a popular alternative is to take the M4 motorway to Bristol, followed by the M5. Although this is a high-quality motorway route throughout, it is a considerably further distance.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2006, Martinez {{joined the}} ECW brand as Ariel, a tarot reading fortune teller. Originally, Martinez was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 'vampire' faction with Gangrel and Kevin Thorn; however, the faction did not {{materialise}} on television. Instead, Ariel and Thorn began appearing in vignettes together, and on July 25, Thorn made his in-ring debut with Ariel acting as his valet.|$|E

5|$|After the meal, Starling {{tries to}} attack Lecter, but he overpowers her. She {{handcuffs}} his wrist to hers. Hearing the police closing in, Lecter threatens to sever her cuffed hand to escape. Lecter is later {{seen on a}} flight with his own boxed lunch, his arm in a sling. As he prepares to eat his meal, including what is assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cooked brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food. Initially reluctant, Lecter then assents.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning a}} third title with the Crusaders in 2000, he was again {{selected}} for the All Blacks; getting a start against Tonga, and in that years Tri-Nations. After returning from All Blacks duty, he played for Canterbury and contributed to a Ranfurly Shield win over Waitako. Canterbury then reached the NPC final, giving Hammett the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Super 12, Ranfurly Shield, and NPC winning team, {{all in the same}} year. Wellington won the NPC final however, and the opportunity was lost. Hammett was then {{selected for the}} end-of-year All Blacks tour, and played against France and Italy (both as a substitute).|$|E

5|$|Although {{initially}} {{skeptical about}} the role, Perrineau took it after Lost creator J. J. Abrams told him more about it. Much of the first season arc for Michael was rewritten; he was originally going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> love triangle with Korean couple Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), but positive fan reaction to the couple meant this storyline was dropped. After Michael leaves the Island in season two, Perrineau knew {{he would return to}} Lost at some point; he felt there was more to tell of Michael's story. Reception for the character was mixed. However, Perrineau's acting was praised.|$|E
5|$|As a {{young and}} {{promising}} defenceman, Bourdon was regularly mentioned in rumours of trades for more offence at the forward positions. Most significantly, he was speculated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> package in exchange for Tampa Bay Lightning forward Brad Richards. Although Bourdon had a powerful shot, he did not play defence responsibly enough to earn a regular spot on the roster. He began {{to show signs of}} improvement and maturity as the Canucks used him more in the 2007–08 season.|$|E
5|$|Before {{taking the}} role, Capaldi {{said that he}} had to seriously {{consider}} the increased visibility that would come with the part. He {{said in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly that he had been invited to audition for the role of the Eighth Doctor in 1995 before the production of the 1996 TV film, but did not go because he was unsure if he would get the part and did not wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large group of actors turned down for the role.|$|E

5|$|Due to a weak mid-level {{anticyclone}} {{over the}} Gulf of Mexico {{that was not}} observed operationally, Mitch began a slow southerly motion on October27, passing very near Guanaja. The NHC had anticipated the movement <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small loop in the Gulf of Honduras, although the agency noted continued uncertainty. Steadily deteriorating, Mitch weakened below major hurricane intensity late on October28, due to land interaction, upwelling, and possibly an eyewall replacement cycle. On October29, the hurricane made landfall in Honduras, east of La Ceiba, with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Despite being over land, the NHC continued to predict a turn to the north, which would allow for restrengthening.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, it was {{announced}} that a younger John Constantine would feature in Justice League Dark, one of the new titles launched as part of September 2011's DC Universe reboot. He was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> team including Shade, The Changing Man, Deadman and Madame Xanadu, known as Justice League Dark. As part of the DC universe reboot in September 2011, Peter Milligan started the title which featured an alternate version of John Constantine as a prominent part of the team. Milligan wrote eight issues of Justice League Dark, with writer Jeff Lemire taking over on issue nine.|$|E

After the Morrises are taken into custody (which causes Darlene to lose her trust towards Mulder and Scully), Mulder examines the charred roof of their RV, prompting him to head to Lake Okobogee. There, the agents discover sand turned to glass and a burned tree line, indicating {{the presence of a}} massive heat source. Upon encountering some white wolves, Mulder and Scully find Greg Randall's body in a shallow grave.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack was}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coordinated pincer {{movement}} against the airfields. Ju 88s from II./KG 76 were to dive-bomb buildings and hangars from high-altitude first. Five minutes later, 27 Do 17s from I. and II./KG 76 would level-bomb from high altitude to crater the runways and landing grounds while knocking out its defences. 9 Staffel KG 76, the specialist low-level strike unit, {{would go in}} and finish off any buildings still standing. It was a bold and imaginative plan. If it worked, it would wreck Kenley from end-to-end. The high-flying bombers would have full fighter escort but the low-flying bombers would have to use stealth to avoid interception {{to and from the}} target area. The operation began at 09:00 but was postponed because of heavy haze reducing visibility up to 4,000 feet.|$|E
5|$|The {{common theme}} in {{conspiracy}} theories about a New World Order {{is that a}} secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government—which will replace sovereign nation-states—and an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails {{the establishment of the}} New World Order as the culmination of history's progress. Many influential historical and contemporary figures have therefore been purported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events, ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies, at both national and international levels, as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination.|$|E

5|$|The section {{through the}} Naomikong Point area was built {{starting}} in 1967 by the Michigan State Highway Department {{under contract to}} the USFS. The road, at the time, was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> longer scenic highway that would connect a proposed lakeshore road through the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore with roads running along Whitefish Bay and the St. Marys River south of Sault Ste. Marie. The western end was realigned and paved in the late 1970s, moving the roadway closer to Tahquamenon Bay west of Naomikong Point. The former roadway was removed in the process. The last section was paved in 1987 between the two paved sections at Naomikong and Iroquois points.|$|E
5|$|The volcano appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> north-south {{trending}} {{group of}} rhyolitic, silicic Quaternary volcanoes (including Puelche Volcanic Field, Laguna del Maule, and Volcán Domuyo) that veers off the north-northeast {{direction of the}} rest of the Andes. The directional formation of this belt corresponds to the fold-and-thrust movement of the nearby Malargüe fault, which formed in the Tertiary and remained active until the early Pliocene or late Miocene. This may suggest that Calabozos' activity is more dependent on local processes than subduction of the Nazca Plate.|$|E
