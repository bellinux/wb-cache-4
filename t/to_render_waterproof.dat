The technology for developing waterproof breathable textiles is focussed around two key aspects: The polymer membrane that is laminated onto the fabric <b>to</b> <b>render</b> it <b>waterproof</b> and breathable and the lamination technology with allows the proper adhesion of the membrane and fabric. Numerous breakthroughts have been made {{over the past two}} decades with regard to the development of new polymer membranes for clothing lamination.

40|$|Acrylamide {{produces}} ataxia {{and limb}} weakness in rats when given in repeated oral doses of 25 to I 00 mg. /kg. at various intervals or {{mixed with the}} diet in concentrations of 100 tO 400 p. p. m. An electrophysiological and histological study of peripheral nerves {{has been carried out}} in chronically poisoned rats. In animals with severe clinical abnormalities, motor nerve conduction velocity in the fibres supplying the small muscles of the hind paw was reduced to approximately 8 o % of the control value. Histologically, degeneration of axis cylinders and myelin sheaths was found in peripheral nerves, affecting predominantly the distal parts of the longest fibres. When paralysed animals were no longer given acrylamide, they recovered clinically, conduction velocity returned to the normal range, and there was histological evidence of regeneration of nerve fibres. Acrylamide CH 2 = CHCONH 2 has a number of commercial uses, one of which involves pumping solutions containing acrylamide into soil during mining and tunnelling operations in order <b>to</b> <b>render</b> the soil <b>waterproof.</b> It seemed possible that under these conditions men might be seriously exposed t...|$|R
40|$|Cellulose acetate and {{cellulose}} nitrate are the important constituents of airplane dopes in {{use at the}} present time, but planes were treated with other materials in the experimental stages of flying. The above compounds belong to the class of colloids and are of value because they produce a shrinking action on the fabric when drying out of solution, rendering it drum tight. Other colloids possessing the same property have been proposed and tried. In the first stages {{of the development of}} dope, however, shrinkage was not considered. The fabric was treated merely <b>to</b> <b>render</b> it <b>waterproof.</b> The first airplanes constructed were covered with cotton fabric stretched as tightly as possible over the winds, fuselage, etc., and flying was possible only in fine weather. The necessity of an airplane which would fly under all weather conditions at once became apparent. Then followed experiments with rubberized fabrics, fabrics treated with glue rendered insoluble by formaldehyde or bichromate, fabrics treated with drying and nondrying oils, shellac, casein, etc. It was found that fabrics treated as above lost their tension in damp weather, and the oil from the motor penetrated the proofing material and weakened the fabric. For the most part the film of material lacked durability. Cellulose nitrate lacquers, however were found to be more satisfactory under varying weather conditions, added less weight to the planes, and were easily applied. On the other hand, they were highly inflammable, and oil from the motor penetrated the film of {{cellulose nitrate}}, causing the tension of the fabric to be relaxed...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{excellent}} properties of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), the condensation technique {{may have some}} influence in its sealing ability. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the sealing ability of sonic and ultrasonic setting of MTA. Thirty-four extracted human teeth had their canals prepared and filled with Sealapex sealer and gutta-percha using the active lateral condensation technique. The teeth were <b>rendered</b> <b>waterproof</b> and apicoectomy performed at 3 mm from the apex. Root-end cavities (3. 0 mm deep and 1. 4 mm diameter) were prepared with diamond ultrasonic tips. The root-end cavities were filled with Pro-Root MTA&# 174; with ultrasonic vibration, sonic vibration or no vibration. The positive control group did not receive any material while the negative control group was totally <b>rendered</b> <b>waterproof.</b> After material set, the specimens were immersed in Rodhamine B for 24 h, under vacuum in the first 15 min, then washed, dried and split longitudinally for evaluating the infiltration at the dentin/material interface. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's tests at 5 % significance level. Sonic vibration promoted the lowest infiltration values (p< 0. 05). It was concluded that sonic vibration could be considered an efficient aid to improve the sealing ability of MTA when used as root-end filling material...|$|R

The dock walls were of local brick, with Bramley Fall stone coping piece. Cement for the lock wall's front construction was <b>rendered</b> <b>waterproof</b> through the use of pozzolana imported from Italy. Piling for the walls consisted of piles narrowing from 12 by 9 in to 3 in at the bottom supporting sleepers 12 by 6 in wide by deep trenailed to the piles.

50|$|The Carley float {{was formed}} from {{a length of}} copper or steel tubing 12-20 inches (30-50 cm) in {{diameter}} bent into an oval ring. The ring {{was surrounded by a}} buoyant mass of kapok or cork, and then covered with a layer of canvas <b>rendered</b> <b>waterproof</b> via painting or doping. The metal tube was divided into waterproof compartments with vertical baffles. The raft was thus rigid, and could remain buoyant, floating equally well with either side uppermost, even if the waterproof outer was punctured. The floor of the raft was made from a wood or webbing grating. Boxes containing paddles, water, rations and survival equipment were lashed to the floor grating. Men could either sit around the rim of the raft, or, if in the water, cling to rope loops strung around its edge. The largest model could accommodate up to fifty men, half inside the raft, and the others in the water holding onto the ropes.|$|R
