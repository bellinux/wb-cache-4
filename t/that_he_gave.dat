Although Alex Muradin, Softpedia editor, expressed concern over the lack of proper technical support for TuneUp Utilities 2006, he gave this product a final score of 5 out of 5. However, it is notable <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> this product a subscore of 3 out of 5 for pricing/value.|$|E
5|$|Corman had initial {{trouble finding}} {{distribution}} for the film, as some distributors, including American International Pictures (AIP), felt that the film would be interpreted as anti-Semitic, citing the characters of Gravis Mushnick and Siddie Shiva. Welles, who is Jewish, stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> his character a Turkish Jewish accent and mannerisms, and that he saw the humor of the film as playful, and felt there was no intent to defame any ethnic group. The film was finally released by its production company, The Filmgroup, nine months after it had been completed.|$|E

5|$|Ernest learned cavalry {{drill and}} tactics under Captain von Linsingen of the Queen's Light Dragoons, and {{proved to be}} an {{excellent}} horseman as well as a good shot. After only two months of training, Freytag was so impressed by the Prince's progress <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> him a place in the cavalry as captain. Ernest was supposed to receive infantry training, but the King, also impressed by his son's prowess, allowed him to remain with the cavalry.|$|E
5|$|His selflessness and {{strength}} were exemplified {{during this period}} by the assistance <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> to a fellow worker who had become ill. Johnson would carry two sacks of corn on each journey between the wharf and the grain warehouse, rather than the usual single sack, up an incline so steep that it was known as Labour-in-vain-hill. He gave the extra money he earned {{to the family of}} the sick man until he was able to return work.|$|E
5|$|Umar and {{his senate}} {{identified}} this act as misuse of state treasure, {{though not as}} punishing as to lose one's office, Khalid was already warned not act as alone, he should seek permission from his commander or Caliph for such actions. He immediately {{wrote a letter to}} Abu Ubaidah asking him to bring Khalid in front of the congregation, his turban, and take off his cap. Umar wanted Abu Ubaida to ask Khalid from what funds he gave to Ash'as: from his own pocket or from the state treasury? If he confessed to having used the spoils, he was guilty of misappropriation. If he claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> from his own pocket, he was guilty of extravagance. In either case he would be dismissed, and Abu Ubaida would take charge of his duties. Abu Ubaida was himself an admirer of Khalid and loved him as his younger brother, and so said that he was not capable of doing it. Instead, Bilal ibn Ribah was appointed for this task and called back Khalid from Chalcis to Emessa, where he was charged publicly. Khalid stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> money from his own pocket and thus was declared innocent in that charge. However, when he went to Abu Ubaida, he told him that he had been dismissed on the order of Umar and is required to go back to Medina.|$|E

5|$|What {{this phrase}} meant to {{the maker of}} these riddles is {{impossible}} to say. In Hávamál 160 {{it is said that}} the dwarf Thjódrørir sang before Delling's doors, which (in {{view of the fact that}} Delling is the father of Dag (Day) in Vafþrúðnismál 25) may mean <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> warning to his people that the sun was coming up, and they must return to their dark houses; the phrase would then virtually mean 'at sunrise.'

5|$|Wulfhelm (died 12 February 941) was Bishop of Wells {{before being}} {{promoted}} to the Archbishopric of Canterbury about 926. Nothing is known about his time at Wells, but as archbishop he helped codify royal law codes and gave lands to monasteries. He went to Rome soon after his selection as archbishop. Two religious books <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> to his cathedral are still extant.|$|E
5|$|Although the Admiralty saw no use {{to which}} Halkett's designs could be put in general naval service, this larger design was {{extremely}} well received by explorers. John Franklin bought one {{to take on the}} ill-fated 1845 expedition in which the entire expedition party of 129men and two ships vanished. Franklin saw Halkett boats as so essential to travel in Canada <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> the boat intended for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land, for use in his travels in the region. He ordered a replacement boat from Halkett, who delivered it in time for him to take possession before setting out on his last expedition.|$|E

5|$|Beginning on 22 August 2013, the Jinan Intermediate People's Court heard Bo's case. The {{proceedings}} of the trial were relayed in real-time by the court's official microblog account, though journalists covering the trial needed {{to belong to a}} pre-approved list. Bo faced three charges: bribery, abuse of power, and embezzlement. The prosectors alleged that Bo received the equivalent of some 21.79 million yuan (US$3.56 million) in bribes from businessmen Xu Ming and Tang Xiaolin. At the trial Xu Ming testified <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> Bo's wife Gu Kailai $3.23 million in 2000 to buy the villa Fontaine St-Georges in Nice, France, and that he paid for their son Bo Guagua's travel and credit card bills. Bo Xilai cross-examined Xu and denied knowledge of many of the payments.|$|E
5|$|Chesney was {{a builder}} in his diocese, where {{he ordered the}} {{construction}} of the episcopal palace. He also founded a Gilbertine house of canons just outside the city of Lincoln, the priory of St Catherine, shortly after the order was recognised by the papacy in 1148. Unusually for its time it was only founded for men, although Gilbertine monastic houses typically accommodated both men and women. In 1161 he bought the Old Temple in London as a house for himself. These expenditures contributed to his financial difficulties, along with royal demands, which led to complaints about Chesney's spending. Another cause for complaint was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> away some of his estates as marriage portions for his nieces. Chesney also was a benefactor to the town of Banbury, to which he granted the right to hold a fair some time before 1154.|$|E
5|$|Constantine met {{his future}} wife, Norma Agatha Cox, in 1921. She had little {{interest}} in cricket and, although their relationship developed during the early 1920s, she resented <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> more time to cricket than he did to her. However, the relationship lasted and she began to take more of an interest in his sporting achievements. They were married on 25 July 1927; their only child, Gloria, was born in April 1928. Throughout their marriage, his wife motivated him to continue his efforts to further his career and they remained close. Norma died two months after her husband in 1971.|$|E

5|$|George {{was active}} in {{directing}} British foreign policy during his early reign. In 1717 he contributed {{to the creation of}} the Triple Alliance, an anti-Spanish league composed of Great Britain, France and the United Provinces. In 1718 the Holy Roman Empire was added to the body which became known as the Quadruple Alliance. The subsequent War of the Quadruple Alliance involved the same issue as the War of the Spanish Succession. The Treaty of Utrecht (1713) had recognised the grandson of King Louis XIV of France, Philip, as the King of Spain on the condition <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> up his rights to succeed to the French throne. Upon the death of Louis XIV in 1715, however, Philip sought to overturn the treaty.|$|E
5|$|Leofric {{replaced}} the monks with canons. The new community {{was given the}} Rule of Chrodegang by Leofric, which rule he had probably learned in Lotharingia before his return to England. Leofric moved {{the seat of his}} see because Crediton was too poor and rural, and Exeter was a city with protective walls and an abandoned church that could be used as the new cathedral. Leofric claimed that he found his diocese lacking in episcopal vestments and the other items required for church services, and his surviving list of gifts to the church noted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> vestments, crosses, chalices, censers, altar coverings, and other furnishings to the cathedral.|$|E
5|$|One morning Josh {{witnesses}} Arthur Shaw, {{a wealthy}} Tower resident, being kidnapped. Josh gives chase, but is tackled by FBI agent Claire Denham, who explains that Shaw {{was attempting to}} flee the country and avoid arrest for embezzling $2 billion in a Ponzi scheme. Josh confesses to the Tower staff <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> their pensions to Shaw to invest, and they have lost everything; Lester attempts suicide by stepping {{in front of a}} train, but survives. After visiting Lester in the hospital, Josh, Charlie, and Enrique confront Shaw, under house arrest in his penthouse apartment. Shaw expresses condolences, but is not sincere enough when he forgets to ask if Lester is all right, and out of anger, Josh smashes the windows of the 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso displayed in Shaw's apartment. Josh's boss, Mr. Simon, fires him for his actions, as well as Charlie and Enrique.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} was so serious that Augustus himself {{appeared at the}} trial, {{even though he had}} not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> no such order. Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.|$|E
5|$|This {{bridge is}} {{named in honor}} and remembrance of Charles West Cullen (18651948), a man who {{dedicated}} his life to public service and {{to the citizens of}} Delaware. Between 1930 and 1940, he served on the State Highway Commission, eventually being elevated to Chairman of the Commission from 1938-1939. While he was Chairman, work was started on a new bridge to span the Indian River Inlet. In recognition for his service on the Commission, the bridge was dedicated on May 28, 1940, in his name for his advocacy for the proper opening of the inlet and the internal development of the Indian River. Two additional bridges bearing his name have spanned the inlet since that time. This, the fifth bridge to span the inlet waterway, is also being dedicated in his name. As this bridge serves the public, let us not forget the lifetime of service <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave.</b>|$|E

Although Jerry offers George his own ticket, George does {{not go to the}} game with Horneck because he does not know Horneck. Jerry decides to give Horneck both tickets, {{claiming}} that he cannot make the game because he is tutoring his nephew. Later, the night of the Knicks game,Jerry is in his apartment talking to his ex-girlfriend Elaine. She jokingly tries to add to Jerry's list of excuses with which he avoids Horneck. He later discovers that Horneck took Kramer to the game and that Horneck is in the building. When Horneck meets Jerry and Elaine, Horneck invites them out to another Knicks game. They come up with more unusual excuses in an attempt to avoid going out. However, Horneck then gets out a newspaper and tries to organize a time when they can all meet, weeks in advance. Jerry realizes that no matter what excuses he comes up with, he cannot avoid Horneck.|$|E
