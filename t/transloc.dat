40|$|PcrA is a DNA helicase {{involved}} in unwinding plasmi ds {{as a part}} of a complex in asymmetric rolling - circle replication of certain plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes. PcrA translocates on single stranded DNA by coupling ATP hydrolysis to movement on DNA. Initiator protein, RepD is required to nick supercoiled plasmid site - specifically and open an ssDNA stretch that PcrA can bind. The presence of RepD is needed throughout plasmid unwinding to maintain processivity. Using fluorescent - based techniques, PcrA helicase mechanistic functions and interactions with different components of the replication complex were examined at the ensemble and single molecule level. The development of ensemble techniques included labelling of PcrA with environment sensitive fluorophores such as the coumarin derivative, MDCC. Using MDCC - PcrA(K 138 C) a <b>transloc</b> ation assay was developed, which determined that PcrA translocates two times faster on dC (500 bases s - 1) than on dT oligos (240 bases s - 1). MDCC - PcrA(E 449 C) was used to investigate the PcrA and RepD interaction. The signal observed with this and other labelled PcrA mutants indicated that the 2 B subdomain of PcrA is likely to be interaction site between PcrA and RepD. MDCC - PcrA(E 449 C) enabled the determination of PcrA kin etics with the initiation complex and showed that ATP - PcrA binds differently to PcrA to RepD - DNA complex as compared to apo PcrA, possibly indicating tha t ATP binding stabilises PcrA in a specific conformation when binding to RepD - DNA. A single - molecule a ssay was developed to study individual surface - bound PcrA helicases unwinding full length plasmids by total internal reflection fluorescence microscop y. PcrA unwinds plasmid with the average rate of 40 - 50 bp s - 1 showing 10 - fold variation between the indivi dual helicases. The experiments indicated that the unwinding starts almost immediately after addition of ATP. The single molecule experiments with fluorophore - labelled biotinylated PcrA so clear indication that PcrA unwinds plasmids as a monomer with proce ssivity over 3000 base pairs. The comparison of the ssDNA translocation rate and dsDN A unwinding rates show ed a significant difference between the two forms of translocation, which indicate d PcrA to be a passive helicase. This means that PcrA is n o t active ly destabilising the hydrogen bonding between DNA bases but taking advantage of the thermal fluctuation between the base pairs and so leading to separation of component DNA strands...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} ADAM proteases play {{important}} roles in ectodomain shedding o f various proteins, including paracrine growth factors, receptors or adh esion molecules. ADAM 10 stands out for {{its role in the}} proteolytic proce ssing and shedding of a rapidly growing number of critically important s ubstrates proteins like Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), Cadherins and N otch receptors, thereby initiating their regulated intramembrane proteol ysis (RIP). Here we show that ADAM 10 itself is subject to RIP. We identi fy ADAM 9 and - 15 as shedding proteases capable of releasing the ADAM 10 e ctodomain, and Presenilin/g-Secretase as the protease responsible for th e release of the ADAM 10 intracellular domain (ICD). This domain <b>transloc</b> ates to the nucleus and localizes to nuclear speckles, thought to be inv olved in gene regulation. We also show that the ectodomain shedding of A DAM 10 by ADAMs 9 and 15 occurs both in vitro and in vivo. The soluble ec todomain sADAM 10 is an active protease with the intriguing capacity to s hed typical substrates, like APP or N-cadherin, from distant membrane su rfaces as well as to cleave soluble substrates like Ab. Shedding of ADAM 10 is especially prominent in the brain and is developmentally regulated, with high pre- and early postnatal levels that drop to a lower constan t amount in adulthood which then further decrease during aging. The ADAM 10 ectofragment is also found in the human brain and was conspicuously r educed in a pilot group of AD patients as compared to age-matched contro ls. In summary, these findings indicate that the different domains found in ADAM 10 may confer a significant functional potential (long-range Secre tase with possible functions in development and tissue plasticity and po ssibly as an additional line of defense against Ab accumulations; cell a dhesion via the disintegrin and cystein-rich domains; cell signalling vi a the ICD) way beyond its role as cell surface proteases. We also demonstrate in collaboration with the group of P. Saftig (CAU Kie l, Germany) that neuronal cadherin (N-cadherin) is cleaved specifically by ADAM 10 in its ectodomain, directly regulating the overall levels of N -cadherin expression at the cell surface. The ADAM 10 -induced N-cadherin cleavage changes the adhesive behaviour of cells and results in a dramat ic redistribution of b-catenin from the cell surface to the cytoplasmic pool, thereby influencing the expression of b-catenin target genes. ADAM 10 thus constitutes a central switch in the signalling pathway from N-ca dherin at the cell surface to beta-catenin/LEF- 1 -regulated gene expressi on in the nucleus. Furthermore, I was part of a team in our lab that investigated the pheno type of mice in which the genes that encode for Aph 1, one of the four ma in g-Secretase constituents, were inactivated. Aph 1 A-/- embryos show a l ethal phenotype characterized by angiogenesis defects in the yolk sac, n euronal tube malformations, and mild somitogenesis defects, with similar ities to the PS 1, 2 -/- or ADAM 10 -/- knockout mice. Aph 1 B-/- or C-/- or th e combined Aph 1 BC-/- mice (which can be considered as a model for total Aph 1 B loss in human) survive into adulthood but display behavioral abnor malities that could be reversed by antipsychotic drugs. Our work provide s in vivo evidence for the concept that different g-Secretase complexes may exert different biological functions. In the context of AD therapy, this implies the theoretical possibility that targeting specific g-Secre tase subunit combinations could yield less toxic drugs than the currentl y available general inhibitors of g-Secretase activity. An extremely intr iguing fact about gamma-Secretase, is its ability to cleave more t han 30 type I transmembrane proteins, that do not share any sequence hom ology around their cleavage site. The only prerequisite for their intram embranous cleavage is the shortening of its ectodomain by sheddases, lik e ADAM 10. This apparent lack of specificity will have repercussions when regarding regulation of gamma-Secretase activity. During a study exchange in the lab of Prof. SJ DeArmond (UCSF San Francisco, USA), I wa s involved in a study in which the combined oral administration of quina crine and g-Secretase inhibitor LY 411575 was shown to reduce levels of t he prion protein PrP(Sc) and Notch- 1 intracellular domain transcription factor (NICD) formation and prevent following dendritic atrophy in a mou se model for Creutzfeldt Jacob disease. This study was the first to show a promising effect of g-Secretase inhibitors on the morphological subst rate of neurodegeneration. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Policy Questions: How {{should a}} large urban {{university}} make short-term trade-offs in its provision of transit service to a new, multi-use library {{that is expected}} to shift demand towards new transit policies? How should the goals of transportation and campus planning fit into a larger decision-making process for university development? Recommendations: Based on the emerging preference among the NCSU community for rapid, direct bus services between major trip generators and in particular between Main Campus and Centennial Campus, these recommendations focus on short-term route adjustments and long-term changes in service delivery. The short-term route changes to the Wolfline system can meet demand at the Hunt Library without incurring substantial changes in existing service patterns or increases in transit resources. The long-term route changes impact the larger issues of campus planning and community engagement that NC State Transportation must address as Centennial Campus becomes a larger and more multi-use part of the campus. Short-term transit demand analysis at Hunt Library: 2012 — 2013 •	Re-route 3 A Centennial Express and 8 Southeast Loop to stop at Hunt Library via Main Campus Drive and Partners Way •	Do not change frequencies on 8 Southeast Loop •	Move one bus from 3 Engineering to 3 A Centennial Express to improve frequencies •	Increase daily end of 3 A Centennial Express service from 6 : 30 PM to 9 : 54 PM Long-term campus development planning and transit planning: 2015 — 2022 •	Wolfline service o	Shift focus on Wolfline service from circulating loops to prioritize rapid, high-frequency service between campus precincts via major transit hubs and trip generators with limited stops o	Develop express bus service between Hunt Library and D. H. Hill Library with limited stops along North and Central Campus precincts o	Shift express bus service to corridor between Hunt Library and Talley Student Center following completion of renovations •	Development of parking decks for parking supply o	Ensure that each campus precinct has sufficient parking for people traveling to precinct o	Maintain sufficient surface parking around campus buildings to permit access for facilities vehicles and emergency service vehicles •	Pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure o	Implement reductions in automobile access on Dan Allen Drive to improve pedestrian safety o	Increase bike and pedestrian safety at Avent Ferry and Western intersection •	NCSU community outreach o	Communicate clear service standards for Wolfline operations to NCSU community to set expectations about public transportation services 	Stress the use of the <b>TransLoc</b> app to make wait times more predictable o	Communicate the Wolfline system upgrades and benefits that students, faculty, staff and corporate partners receive from their student fee and parking fee contributions o	Communicate all restrictions in automobile access as early and as directly as possible to give opportunities for community feedback and travel behavior adjustment o	Update Office of University Architect and Centennial Campus Development Office on transit technologies and infrastructures at all levels: NCSU; City of Raleigh; North Carolina Context for Case Study: This project uses North Carolina State University as a case study for transit planning at large urban university campuses and focuses on a new capital project, a large, multi-use library called the James B. Hunt Jr. Library located on the Centennial Campus of NCSU, a newer satellite campus precinct that is currently undergoing expansion. The NCSU Transportation Department will be responsible for providing public transit service (the Wolfline) for students, faculty and staff who want to travel to and from the Hunt Library, which is scheduled to open in the winter of 2013. Many departments attached to the Hunt Library and Centennial Campus view the Library as a flagship building that will raise the profile of NCSU and will transform the Centennial Campus from “an office park environment” to a “campus environment,” with greater student and pedestrian activity. Since the building will likely {{have a significant impact on}} a rapidly developing campus precinct, NC State Transportation must evaluate the potential demand for traveling to and from the Hunt Library that students, faculty and staff demonstrate to determine the impact that the Library will have on the Wolfline system. This expansion of transit service is one of several changes in transit operations that NC State Transportation is evaluating in its Campus Mobility Plan. The goal of the Campus Mobility Plan is to outline the changes in funding, service provision and streetscape infrastructure that are necessary to create an “enhanced multimodal campus transportation system” over the next ten years. Because the Campus Mobility Plan has far-reaching impact on the physical design of the campus, NC State Transportation will be communicating with and working with numerous departments across the NCSU Administration. Representatives from these departments serve as Advisory Stakeholders to the CMP and have the opportunity to share their visions for the Hunt Library and NCSU transportation in general with the Department at planning meetings. Methodology: This report bases its analysis on three evaluations. The first evaluation is an estimation of ridership and transit demand at the Hunt Library based on trip generation rates at the Library as a function of the Library’s net assignable square footage. This report compares these estimates to trip generation rates at the D. H. Hill Library and distributes the number of daily trips that each building generates into trips in to the library and trips out of the library and into low-demand morning hours and high-demand afternoon and evening hours. This analysis takes this system of trip generation and distribution from the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ Trip Generation Report and applies the system to both libraries. The second and third evaluations are both qualitative. The second evaluation extrapolates trends in stated preferences from two surveys that NC State Transportation conducted in the Fall of 2011 : a Customer Satisfaction Survey that the Department distributed to a sample of students, faculty and staff; and an Engineering Student Survey that the Department distributed to a sample of first-years, sophomores and juniors who have a major in the College of Engineering. Both surveys evaluate student preferences for Wolfline services and ask students to predict their interest in using the Hunt Library and their travel behaviors to and from the Library. The third evaluation is a series of interviews with members of the NCSU community who are serving as Advisory Stakeholders for the Campus Mobility Plan. The author interviews each stakeholder to obtain the stakeholder’s perspective on the current services that NC State Transportation offers to the larger community and those that the Department plans on providing. Specifically, these interviews focus on Wolfline services, parking services, the design and planning of campus transportation infrastructure, and the Hunt Library. Findings: 1. 	Assuming a seven-percent mode share for Wolfline services, estimated levels of demand for Wolfline services at the Hunt Library are within the system’s current capacity and NC State Transportation can meet this demand with small changes to existing services. 2. 	The Customer Satisfaction Survey and the Engineering Student Survey reflect that the Wolfline service plays an important role in students’ mobility on a daily basis and that students show a high level of familiarity with the information technologies that NC State Transportation uses to promote its services and notify riders about changes and updates. 3. 	Students’ priorities for service improvements focus on greater frequency, longer evening service hours, and more connections between Main Campus and Centennial Campus. 4. 	The Customer Satisfaction Survey and the Engineering Student Survey show high levels of interest in the Hunt Library and high levels of demand for travel between Main Campus and Centennial Campus. 5. 	The results of the stakeholder analysis show substantial support for an increase in public transportation services and for greater connectivity between Main Campus and Centennial Campus. Many stakeholders express significant concern for reducing automobile access on Main Campus and promoting the development of parking decks over surface parking. Stakeholders also express opposition for increasing parking fees or transportation fees to fund an increase in Wolfline services. Support for greater pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure is present, but opinions are more muted. 6. 	Many stakeholders state a preference for direct, limited-stop services between major trip generators with low travel times and high frequencies and believe that the growth of Centennial Campus will create greater demand for these services. They assert that NC State Transportation should prioritize these services in its future route planning. 7. 	Many stakeholders stress that the Department should engage with the NCSU community more directly and openly about the opportunities and limitations of a public transit system and its ability to enhance mobility and connectivity across the campus. 8. 	Several stakeholders believe that NC State Transportation should increase its investments in transportation infrastructure and develop high-speed, high-frequency transit services that are more capital-intensive than the current Wolfline system, including light rail transit and bus-only corridors...|$|E
