On , a group of five Tu-142s tracked a US submarine in the Philippine Sea; one of the Tu-142s reportedly trailed the submarine for 4 hours and 5 minutes. Soviet Tu-142s, besides operating domestically, were sent to friendly overseas bases in Angola, Cuba, Ethiopia, Vietnam, and Yemen. In the early 1990s, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Soviet fleet of Tu-142s was handed to the Russian Navy, although the Ukrainian Air Force gained a few Tu-142s that had been left in its territory. Ukrainian Tu-142s were later dismantled as a result of <b>the</b> <b>bilateral</b> START I treaty signed between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1991, which came into effect in late 1994.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Ultrasound imaging {{technology}} has wide applications in cattle reproduction {{and has been}} used to monitor individual follicles and determine the patterns of follicular development. However, the speckles in ultrasound images affect the post-processing, such as follicle segmentation and finally affect the measurement of the follicles. In order to reduce the effect of speckles, a bilateral filter is developed in this paper. Results We develop a new bilateral filter for speckle reduction in ultrasound images for follicle segmentation and measurement. Different from <b>the</b> previous <b>bilateral</b> filters, <b>the</b> proposed <b>bilateral</b> filter uses normalized difference in the computation of the Gaussian intensity difference. We also present the results of follicle segmentation after speckle reduction. Experimental results on both synthetic images and real ultrasound images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter. Conclusions Compared with <b>the</b> previous <b>bilateral</b> filters, <b>the</b> proposed <b>bilateral</b> filter can reduce speckles in both high-intensity regions and low intensity regions in ultrasound images. The segmentation of the follicles in the speckle reduced images by the proposed method has higher performance than the segmentation in the original ultrasound image, and the images filtered by Gaussian filter, <b>the</b> conventional <b>bilateral</b> filter respectively. </p...|$|R
40|$|Classification of hyperspectral images (HSI) {{has been}} a {{challenging}} problem under active investigation for years especially due to the extremely high data dimensionality and limited number of samples available for training. It is found that hyperspectral image classification can be generally improved only if the feature extraction technique and the classifier are both addressed. In this paper, a novel classification framework for hyperspectral images based on <b>the</b> joint <b>bilateral</b> filter and sparse representation classification (SRC) is proposed. By employing the first principal component as the guidance image for <b>the</b> joint <b>bilateral</b> filter, spatial features can be extracted with minimum edge blurring thus {{improving the quality of}} the band-to-band images. For this reason, the performance of <b>the</b> joint <b>bilateral</b> filter has shown better than that of <b>the</b> conventional <b>bilateral</b> filter in this work. In addition, the spectral similarity-based joint SRC (SS-JSRC) is proposed to overcome the weakness of the traditional JSRC method. By combining <b>the</b> joint <b>bilateral</b> filtering and SS-JSRC together, the superiority of the proposed classification framework is demonstrated with respect to several state-of-the-art spectral-spatial classification approaches commonly employed in the HSI community, with better classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient achieved...|$|R

50|$|Apart from agriculture, {{there are}} minimal {{economic}} and trade barriers between the European Union and Switzerland. In {{the wake of}} the Swiss voters' rejection of the European Economic Area Agreement in 1992, the Swiss Government set its sights on negotiating bilateral economic agreements with the EU. Four years of negotiations culminated in Bilaterals, a cross-platform agreement covering seven sectors: research, public procurement, technical barriers to trade, agriculture, civil aviation, land transport, and the free movement of persons. Parliament officially endorsed <b>the</b> <b>Bilaterals</b> in 1999 and it was approved by general referendum in May 2000. The agreements, which were then ratified by the European Parliament and the legislatures of its member states, entered into force on June 1, 2002. The Swiss government has since embarked on a second round of negotiations, called <b>the</b> <b>Bilaterals</b> II, which will further strengthen the country's economic ties with the organisation.|$|R
