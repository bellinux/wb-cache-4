5|$|Other sites {{show more}} circumstantial {{evidence}} of mammoth hunting, such as piled bones bearing butcher marks. Some {{of these sites}} are not closely associated with Clovis points. The Lehner Mammoth-Kill Site and <b>the</b> <b>Dent</b> Site, where multiple juvenile and adult mammoths have been found with butcher marks and in association with Clovis points, were once interpreted as the killing of entire herds by Clovis hunters. However, isotope {{studies have shown that}} the accumulations represent individual deaths at different seasons of the year, and therefore not herds killed in single incidents. Many other such assemblages of bones with butcher marks may also represent accumulations over time, and are therefore ambiguous as evidence for large scale hunting.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of transfers, Overbeck tried to sell the {{territory}} to Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy but all rejected his offer. Overbeck then co-operated with the British Dent brothers (Alfred Dent and Edward Dent) for financial backing to develop the land, with <b>the</b> <b>Dent</b> company persuading him that any investors would need guarantees of British military and diplomatic support. Overbeck agreed to this co-operation, {{especially with regard to}} the counterclaims of the Sultan of Sulu, part of whose territory in the Sulu Archipelago had been occupied by Spain. Overbeck, however, withdrew in 1879 and his treaty rights were transferred to Alfred Dent, who in 1881 formed the North Borneo Provisional Association Ltd to administer the territory. In the following year, Kudat was made its capital but due to frequent pirate attacks, the capital was moved to Sandakan in 1884. To prevent further disputes over intervention, the governments of the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany signed the Madrid Protocol of 1885, recognising the sovereignty of the King of Spain over the Sulu Archipelago in return for the relinquishment of all Spanish claims over northern Borneo. The arrival of the company brought prosperity to the residents of northern Borneo, with the company allowing indigenous communities to continue their traditional lifestyles, but imposing laws against headhunting, ethnic feuds, slave trade, and piracy. North Borneo then became a protectorate of the United Kingdom in 1888 despite facing local resistance from 1894 to 1900 by Mat Salleh and Antanum in 1915.|$|E

5|$|Like modern elephants, Columbian mammoths were {{probably}} social {{and lived in}} matriarchal (female-led) family groups; most of their other social behavior was also {{similar to that of}} modern elephants. This is supported by fossil assemblages such as <b>the</b> <b>Dent</b> Site in Colorado and the Waco Mammoth National Monument in Waco, Texas, where groups consisting entirely of female and juvenile Columbian mammoths have been found (implying female-led family groups). The latter assemblage includes 22 skeletons, with 15 individuals representing a herd of females and juveniles that died in a single event. It was originally proposed that the herd was killed by a flash flood, and that the arrangement of some of the skeletons suggests that the females may have formed a defensive ring around the juveniles. In 2016, it was instead suggested that the herd had died by drought near a diminishing watering hole; scavenging traces on the bones contradicts rapid burial, and the absence of calves and large diversity of other animal species found gathered at the site support this scenario. Another group, consisting of a bull and six females, is found at the same site; although both groups died between 64,000 and 73,000 years ago, whether they died in the same event is unknown. At the Murray Springs Clovis Site in Arizona, where several Columbian mammoth skeletons have been excavated, a trackway similar to that left by modern elephants leads to one of the skeletons. The mammoth may have made the trackway before it died, or another individual may have approached the dead or dying animal—similar to the way modern elephants guard dead relatives for several days.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} <b>the</b> <b>denting</b> <b>the</b> {{response}} of pipeline segments subjected to lateral quasi-static wedge loading, {{in the presence}} of internal pressure. Nonlinear finite element models of pipeline segments, which are in good agreement with denting test data from internally pressurized pipes, are employed to obtain load-deflection curves for different levels of pressure, for various wedge shapes and for different types of boundary conditions. It is found that the presence of internal pressure increases significantly <b>the</b> <b>denting</b> resistance. <b>The</b> present study gives special emphasis on the development of a simplified three-dimensional analytical model, which yields closed-form expressions for <b>the</b> <b>denting</b> force and <b>the</b> corresponding <b>denting</b> length in terms of <b>the</b> corresponding <b>denting</b> displacement. <b>The</b> model, introduced elsewhere for non-pressurized tubes, is enhanced to include the pressure effects, accounting for different types of pipe end conditions.

Its height is exceeded by four major summits: the Weisshorn (4,505 m), the Dom (4,545 m), the Liskamm (4,527 m) and the second highest in the Alps, Monte Rosa (4,634 m). This section of the Pennine Alps, including the Matterhorn, the Zinalrothorn, <b>the</b> <b>Dent</b> Blanche, <b>the</b> <b>Dent</b> d'Hérens, the Breithorn, the Strahlhorn, the Rimpfischhorn and the Alphubel, concentrates most of western Europe's highest mountains and forms a crown of peaks around Zermatt.

25|$|The dales are 'U' and 'V' shaped valleys, {{the former}} {{enlarged}} and shaped by glaciers, {{mainly in the}} most recent Devensian ice age. The underlying rock is mainly Carboniferous Limestone, which results in a large areas of karst topography, in places overlain with shale and sandstone and topped with Millstone Grit, although to the north and west of <b>the</b> <b>Dent</b> Fault the hills are formed from older Silurian and Ordovician rocks.|$|E
25|$|The Matterhorn has a {{pyramidal}} {{shape with}} four faces nearly facing the four compass points. Three of them (north, east and west) {{are on the}} Swiss {{side of the border}} and watershed (Mattertal valley) and one of them (south) is on the Italian side of the border (Valtournenche valley). The north face overlooks the Ober Gabelhorn (7km away) across the Zmutt Glacier and valley (above Zermatt), the east face overlooks the Gorner Glacier system between the Gornergrat and Monte Rosa (respectively 10 and 17km away) across the Theodul Pass, the west face overlooks the upper basin of the Zmutt Glacier between <b>the</b> <b>Dent</b> Blanche and <b>the</b> <b>Dent</b> d'Hérens (respectively 7 and 4km away) and the south face fronts the resort town of Breuil-Cervinia and overlooks {{a good portion of the}} Valtournenche. The Matterhorn does not form a perfect square pyramid, as the north and south faces are wider than the west and east faces. Moreover, the latter faces do not actually meet on the summit but are connected by a 100-metre-long horizontal west–east ridge between the north and south faces.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} a {{lighthouse}} at Cape Cleveland arose with proclamation of Cleveland Bay as a port of entry in 1865, {{and the development of}} Townsville into a major port. From its beginning, the lighthouse was closely related to <b>the</b> <b>Dent</b> Island Light. The construction of both lighthouses was recommended by Commander George Poynter Heath, the Chairman of the Queensland Marine Board, in February 1878. The lighthouses were formally approved in April 1878 and tenders for the construction of both stations, each including a lighthouse and two keepers' cottages, were called in May 1878 and closed in June 1878. The tenders were awarded to W. P. Clark, who also constructed Bustard Head Light (1868), Low Isles Light (1877), Double Island Point Light (1884) and Pine Islet Light (1885). However, following personal difficulties, the contracts were transferred to John Clark and James Wiseman who completed the construction of both stations in December 1879.|$|E

For approximately six weeks the vessel remained in drydock while her bottom was scraped clean of barnacles and other sea growth, the engines and boilers were overhauled, the entire vessel was cleaned and painted, {{and a number}} of improvements made, including an iron shield around the top of the turret. To make the vessel more seaworthy a [...] funnel shaped smokestack was placed over the smoke outlet while taller fresh air vents were installed. The berth deck below was also enlarged and raised by removing some of the side storerooms and placing them below, thus reducing the height of the interior which now barely allowed the crew to stand upright. Several cranes were also added while interior improvements were made making the confining environment more livable. A large blower that operated with its own engine was installed which drew fresh air down through the pilothouse. During this time the two Dahlgren guns were each engraved with large letters, MONITOR & MERRIMAC – WORDEN and MONITOR & MERRIMAC – ERICSSON, respectively. Additional iron plates were installed covering where dents were made during the previous battles. Each plate was inscribed with the name of the source from where the shell causing <b>the</b> <b>dent</b> was made. i.e. Merrimack, Fort Darling, etc. Stanchions were also installed {{around the perimeter of the}} freeboard with a rope strung through each making it safer to walk about the deck amid stormy weather and rough seas. Monitor was finally taken out of drydock on 26 October. By November the ship was fully repaired and refitted, resupplied and ready to return to service.|$|E
