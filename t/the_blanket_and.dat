5|$|It is {{not always}} easy to predict a grown Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed tend to be born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of the}} horse's life although some, such as <b>the</b> <b>blanket</b> <b>and</b> leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.|$|E
5|$|When the {{announcer}} {{at the ball}} asks {{if there is a}} doctor in the house, Mac puts his hand up, to Caroline's embarrassment. Things get more embarrassing when Guy also volunteers, and asks why Caroline is sitting next to Mac when she is Guy's fiancée. A unconscious patient lies on an operating table. Guy touches her breasts, takes pictures of her naked body under <b>the</b> <b>blanket,</b> <b>and</b> kisses her. Caroline alleges that the patient is transgender, which repels Guy. Sue White then appears in a tutu, claiming that the patient is stalking Mac, and repeating the assertion that the patient is transgender.|$|E
5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes on a blanket. Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs <b>the</b> <b>blanket</b> <b>and</b> follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E

5|$|In R v. Fiak (2005), the {{defendant}} used a clean blanket {{to block the}} toilet of the police cell he was occupying, causing the water to overflow and flood his and other cells. The defence argued that clean water had flooded on to a waterproof floor, {{and that in the}} process the blanket was soaked by clean water. The blanket would have been reusable when dry. Cleaning up a wet cell floor did not constitute damage to the cell itself. The Court of Appeal noted that this argument assumed the absence of any possible contamination or infection from the lavatory itself, and held that {{while it is true that}} the effect of the appellant's actions in relation to <b>the</b> <b>blanket</b> <b>and</b> the cell were both remediable, the simple reality was that the blanket could not be used as a blanket by any other prisoner until it had been dried out and cleaned. Further, the flooded cells remained out of action until the water had been cleared. Thus, both had sustained damage, albeit temporary.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Trescott {{returns home}} to find his house ablaze; after he is told by his hysterical wife that Jimmie is still inside, he rushes into the house {{by way of the}} laboratory's hidden passageway. [...] He finds Jimmie still wrapped in <b>the</b> <b>blanket</b> <b>and</b> carries him outside. [...] Hearing that Henry is inside the house, Dr. Trescott {{attempts}} to re-enter, but is held back. [...] Another man goes into the house and returns with the badly burned [...] "thing" [...] that used to be Henry Johnson. [...] The injured men and boy are taken to Judge Denning Hagenthorpe's house across the street to be treated, but while it is thought that Dr. Trescott and Jimmie will survive their injuries, Henry is pronounced as good as dead; he is mourned as a hero by the town.|$|E
500|$|Homer {{initially}} {{refuses to}} attend Bart's show because he discovers the artwork {{is an insult}} to him, but changes his mind after Bart apologizes and writes [...] "I'm sorry" [...] on the hood of Homer's car. At the show, Chief Wiggum and the Springfield Police Department suddenly appear to arrest Bart for making graffiti throughout the town. It is revealed that the gallery show is a sham and that Fairey is an undercover officer who helped the police identify Bart as the graffiti artist that had been spray-painting Springfield. Since Bart is just a boy, he is not sent to jail. Instead, he is punished by once again being locked up in the rabbit cage. When Bart tells Wiggum that he has to go to the bathroom, Wiggum covers the cage with <b>the</b> <b>blanket</b> <b>and</b> finds Bart gone when he removes the blanket from the cage.|$|E

2500|$|He devoted some of {{his free}} time in Malaya to {{creative}} writing [...] "as a sort of gentlemanly hobby, because I knew there wasn't any money in it," [...] and published his first novels: Time for a Tiger, The Enemy in <b>the</b> <b>Blanket</b> <b>and</b> Beds in the East. These became known as The Malayan Trilogy and were later published in one volume as The Long Day Wanes.|$|E
2500|$|His Malayan trilogy The Long Day Wanes was Burgess's first {{published}} fiction. Its three books are Time for a Tiger, The Enemy in <b>the</b> <b>Blanket</b> <b>and</b> Beds in the East. Devil of a State is a follow-on to the trilogy, {{set in a}} fictionalized version of Brunei. [...] It was Burgess's ambition to become [...] "the true fictional expert on Malaya." [...] In these works, Burgess {{was working in the}} tradition established by Kipling for British India, and Conrad and Maugham for Southeast Asia. Burgess operated more in the mode of Orwell, who had a good command of Urdu and Burmese (necessary for Orwell's work as a police officer) and Kipling, who spoke Hindi (having learnt it as a child). Like many of his fellow English expatriates in Asia, Burgess had excellent spoken and written command of his operative language(s), both as a novelist and speaker, including Malay.|$|E
2500|$|First Man, First Woman, Great Coyote, and the Holy People next planned {{stars for}} the night sky.

2500|$|Startup fuel - Unlike mined uranium, mined thorium {{does not}} have a fissile isotope. Thorium {{reactors}} breed fissile uranium-233 from thorium, but require a small amount of fissile material for initial start up. There is relatively little of this material available. This raises {{the problem of how to}} start the reactors in a short time frame. One option is to produce U-233 [...] in today's solid fueled reactors, then reprocess it out of the solid waste. An LFTR can also be started by other fissile isotopes, enriched uranium or plutonium from reactors or decommissioned bombs. For enriched uranium startup, high enrichment is needed. Decommissioned uranium bombs have enough enrichment, but not enough is available to start many LFTRs. It is difficult to separate plutonium fluoride from lanthanide fission products. One option for a two-fluid reactor is to operate with plutonium or enriched uranium in the fuel salt, breed U-233 in <b>the</b> <b>blanket,</b> <b>and</b> store it instead of returning it to the core. Instead, add plutonium or enriched uranium to continue the chain reaction, similar to today's solid fuel reactors. When enough U-233 is bred, replace the fuel with new fuel, retaining the U-233 for other startups. A similar option exists for a single-fluid reactor operating as a converter. Such a reactor would not reprocess fuel while operating. Instead the reactor would start on plutonium with thorium as the fertile and add plutonium. The plutonium eventually burns out and U-233 is produced in situ. At the end of the reactor fuel life, the spent fuel salt can be reprocessed to recover the bred U-233 to start up new LFTRs.|$|E
