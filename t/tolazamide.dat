40|$|The mechanism(s) {{by which}} the oral sulfonylurea, <b>tolazamide,</b> exerts its extrapancreatic hypoglycemic effects was studied using rat epididymal adipose tissue {{maintained}} 20 - 44 h in {{the presence or absence}} of the drug. Insulin binding, hexose transport and glucose metabolism were compared in adipocytes isolated from the cultured tissue. In contrast to earlier reports that suggested that sulfonylureas alter the binding of insulin, neither receptor number nor affinity were changed by <b>tolazamide</b> treatment. The uptake of the glucose analogs 2 -deoxyglucose and 3 - 0 -methylglucose in the absence of insulin (i. e., basal) was also unchanged. However, exposure to <b>tolazamide</b> resulted in a potentiation of the stimulatory effects of insulin by approximately 30 % at each hormone concentration assayed (0. 4 - 40 ng/ml). This potentiation was dependent on the <b>tolazamide</b> concentration (0. 003 - 0. 30 mg/ml), with a maximal effect observed at therapeutic levels. A <b>tolazamide</b> analog hypoglycemic activity in vivo was found not to enhance either basal or insulin-stimulated uptake in vitro. Conversion of 0. 1 - 5. 0 mM glucose to CO 2 and total lipids in the presence of insulin was also potentiated by <b>tolazamide</b> treatment. The inability of the drug to directly stimulate basal glucose uptake was paralleled by its lack of effect on glucose metabolism. At 50 mM glucose, where transport is no longer rate-limiting, <b>tolazamide</b> did not potentiate metabolism in the absence or the presence of insulin. These studies demonstrate that <b>tolazamide</b> in vitro alters postreceptor insulin action without influencing the receptor, and suggests insulin-stimulated hexose transport as the cellular process responsible for the hypoglycemic effect of sulfonyureas in adipose tissue...|$|E

Insulin (10 (- 7) M) increased 2 -deoxyglucose uptake in differentiated L 6 myotubes by 30 - 40 % after 8 h of incubation. The sulfonylurea <b>tolazamide</b> (0. 6 mg/ml, 22 h) {{had no effect on}} glucose uptake in the absence of insulin, but increased insulin-stimulated 2 -deoxyglucose uptake twofold. The total cellular content of glucose transporters was assessed with a monoclonal anti-transporter antibody by a solid-phase ELISA method. Insulin (8 h) increased the quantity of glucose transporters, with a maximal twofold increase at 10 (- 7) M and a dose-response curve similar to that for insulin stimulation of glucose uptake. In spite of its lack of effect on glucose uptake, <b>tolazamide</b> alone (0. 6 mg/ml) increased the cellular content of transporters by 70 %. The effects of insulin and <b>tolazamide</b> on transporter gene expression were studied with probes derived from Hep G 2 glucose transporter cDNA. Insulin increased the transporter mRNA level 1. 7 -fold, <b>tolazamide</b> increased it 1. 5 -fold, and the combination of insulin and <b>tolazamide</b> increased transporter mRNA 3 -fold. It is concluded that sulfonylureas, together with insulin, enhance glucose uptake in L 6 skeletal muscle cells by increasing the number of functioning glucose transport molecules.

40|$|Effects of sulfonylureas, Î±-endosulfine counterparts, on {{glomerulosclerosis}} in type 1 {{and type}} 2 models of diabetes. BackgroundPreviously, we showed {{the expression of}} a unique sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) and its putative endogenous ligand, Î±-endosulfine, in mesangial cells and isolated glomeruli. Further, this ligand was up-regulated by high glucose concentration. To investigate the possible role of Î±-endosulfine up-regulation in diabetes, we administered sulfonylureas, the exogenous ligands of SUR, to diabetic animals. MethodsIn streptozotocin-induced, insulin-deficient, diabetic rats, glomerulosclerosis, albuminuria, glomerular expression of fibronectin mRNA, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were studied for various periods up to 36 weeks. Several rat groups received either glibenclamide or <b>tolazamide</b> during the entire study period. Also, glomerulosclerosis and albuminuria were determined in insulin-resistant db/db mice, at 26 weeks of treatment with <b>tolazamide.</b> ResultsSulfonylureas did not improve hyperglycemia or reduce glycosylated hemoglobin levels. In insulin-deficient diabetic rats, sulfonylureas significantly decreased the degree of glomerulosclerosis and completely reversed the enhanced albumin excretion. Also, glibenclamide reduced diabetes-induced glomerular overexpression of fibronectin mRNA. Because glibenclamide may improve the afferent arteriolar dilatation of diabetes, thereby reducing glomerular hyperfiltration, its effect on GFR was determined. Glibenclamide did not alter glomerular hyperfiltration or renal hypertrophy, regardless of the intensity of hyperglycemia. Finally, in insulin-resistant mice, <b>tolazamide</b> did not alter the extent of diabetic glomerulosclerosis or increased albuminuria. ConclusionLong-term treatment with sulfonylureas completely prevents glomerular injury in insulin-deficient diabetes in rats. However, this protective effect is not demonstrable in an insulin-resistant model of the disease. We postulate that mesangial Î±-endosulfine up-regulation in the hyperglycemic milieu of insulin-deficient diabetes may retard glomerular extracellular matrix formation and mesangial expansion...|$|E
40|$|Effects of oral antihyperglycemic {{agents on}} {{extracellular}} matrix synthesis by mesangial cells. BackgroundIncreased {{expression of the}} glucose transporter GLUT 1 in mesangial cells (MCs) markedly stimulates glucose transport {{and the formation of}} extracellular matrix (ECM), even when ambient glucose concentrations are low. Certain antihyperglycemic agents cause GLUT 1 overexpression and increase glucose transport in various tissues. However, their effects on the kidney are unknown. Because diabetic glomerulosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of mesangial matrix, we studied the effects of antihyperglycemic agents on matrix metabolism in MCs cultured either in 8 or 20 mm glucose. MethodsMembrane-associated GLUT 1 was measured by immunoblotting. The initial rate of glucose transport was determined according to the 2 -deoxy-D[14 C(U) ]glucose uptake. Collagen metabolism was studied by metabolic radiolabeling with [14 C]-proline. Fibronectin in the medium was measured by ELISA. GLUT 1 mRNA was estimated by Northern analysis. ResultsThe sulfonylurea <b>tolazamide</b> increased GLUT 1 protein expression by 107 and 69 % in 8 and 20 mm glucose-grown cells, respectively. However, GLUT 1 mRNA levels remained unchanged. Transporter-dependent deoxyglucose uptake was increased by <b>tolazamide</b> up to 184 % in a dose-dependent fashion and was evident at both glucose concentrations after three or five days of exposure to the drug. <b>Tolazamide</b> significantly stimulated transforming growth factor-Î² 1 (TGF-Î² 1) secretion and the total synthesis of collagen and collagen and fibronectin accumulation in the medium of MCs maintained in high or low glucose concentrations. The biguanide metformin did not alter GLUT 1 expression, glucose transport, fibronectin formation, or collagen metabolism, except at high concentrations.

On {{study showed that}} drug-polymer interactions {{in the context of}} crystallization inhibition using MD simulations is a powerful tool to discern molecular level interactions {{in order to determine the}} energetics involved in the drug-polymer interactions in aqueous media. The crystal growth of <b>tolazamide</b> (TLZ) is modulated by the presence of a diblock copolymer, poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(lactic acid) (PEG-b-PLA). The crystal morphology of the drug then changes from needles to plates in aqueous media. Molecular dynamics simulations on crystal surfaces of TLZ in water containing PEG-b-PLA were conducted to better understand the crystal surface drugâpolymer interaction. Interaction of PEG-b-PLA with the (001) face occurred more rapidly (â¤ 10 Â ns) and more strongly than that with the (010) face, and there was little interaction with the (100) face. Hydrophobic and van der Waals (VDW) interactions were the dominant forces, accounting for more than 90 % of total interaction energies. The work suggests that polymers capable of forming strong hydrophobic and vdW interactions might be more effective in inhibiting crystallization of poorly water-soluble and hydrophobic drugs in aqueous media (such as gastrointestinal fluid) than those with hydrogen-bonding capacities. Such in-depth analyses and understanding facilitate the rational selection of polymers in designing supersaturation-based enabling formulations. These types of simulations are essential for understanding molecular interactions of ASDs.|$|E

BackgroundSulfonylurea receptors are classified as either high-affinity type 1 (SUR 1) or low-affinity type 2 receptors (SUR 2), and the gene expression of SURs has recently been demonstrated in kidney. However, functional data regarding a renal SUR are lacking. We previously demonstrated that mesangial cell (MC) gene and protein expression of extracellular matrix components were up-regulated by the sulfonylurea, <b>tolazamide.</b> After noting this biological response, we next sought to investigate {{the presence of a}} sulfonylurea receptor in rat MCs. MethodsEquilibrium binding studies employing [3 H]glibenclamide as a ligand were performed on crude MC membrane preparations. Gene expression for SUR was explored by Northern analysis of cultured MCs and whole kidney tissue. The effect of sulfonylurea on intracellular Ca 2 + in MCs was assayed by spectrofluorometry, and glibenclamide-induced changes in the contractility of MCs were assessed. ResultsMCs bound [3 H]glibenclamide with a KD of 2. 6 Î¼m and a Bmax of 30. 4 pmol/mg protein as determined by Scatchard analysis. Three SUR 2 transcripts were detected in MCs. A major transcript was detected at 5. 5 kb and minor transcripts at 7. 5 and 8. 6 kb. Following sulfonylurea treatment of MCs, real-time videomicroscopy revealed intense MC contraction, coinciding with oscillatory increments of intracellular Ca 2 + concentration. Further evidence of sulfonylurea-induced MC contraction was demonstrated by glibenclamide-induced deformation of a silicone rubber substrate. ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that SUR 2 resides on MCs. Functional activation of this receptor by sulfonylurea induces Ca 2 + transients that result in MC contraction...|$|E
40|$|Obese {{subjects}} with {{non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus}} (NIDDM) lose weight soon after diagnosis and tend to gain weight during hypoglycemic therapy. One explanation for these weight shifts is the change in caloric loss from glycosuria. We compared 24 obese Pima Indians with NIDDM to 24 Pima Indians with normal glucose tolerance to determine whether resting metabolic rate changes may be an additional factor influencing the weight shifts. The diabetic and nondiabetic subjects were equally obese, body fat 38 +/- 1 % versus 37 +/- 1 % (mean +/- SEM), respectively, as determined by densitometry. In the morning after an overnight fast, resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured by indirect calorimetry. The mean RMR of the diabetic subjects, 32. 9 +/- 0. 5 kcal/day X kg fat-free mass (FFM), was 5 % {{higher than that of}} the nondiabetic subjects, 31. 4 +/- 0. 5 kcal/day X kg FFM (P less than 0. 05). In nine of the diabetic subjects, 6 wk of <b>tolazamide</b> therapy was associated with reductions in mean FPG, 253 +/- 16 to 144 +/- 14 mg/dl (P less than 0. 01), mean daily urine glucose loss, 128 +/- 26 to 11 +/- 4 g (P less than 0. 01), and mean RMR, 31. 9 +/- 0. 8 to 30. 2 +/- 0. 6 kcal/day X kg FFM (P less than 0. 04).

40|$|Sulfonylurea {{drugs are}} widely used for the {{treatment}} of type 2 diabetes. The primary mechanism of action of the sulfonylurea class of drugs is the acute stimulation of insulin secretion by the pancreas (Lebovitz, 1984). However, additional effects on enhanced insulin-mediated glucose uptake both in vivo (Bak et al., 1989; Firth et al., 1986; Kolterman et al., 1984) and in vitro in peripheral tissue have been reported (Cooper et al., 1990; Rogers et al., 1987; Tsiani et al., 1995), although the mechanism of action for glucose uptake is not clear. Studies have shown increased glucose uptake owing to post-receptor effects after treatment with sulfonylureas (Bak et al., 1989; Pulido et al., 1996). One study concluded that the effect of insulin is enhanced while insulin binding remains unaltered following exposure of adipose tissue to <b>tolazamide</b> under in vitro conditions (Maloff and Lockwood, 1981). Santos et al. (2000) recently reported that erythrocyte insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase activity is increased in glyburide-treated patients with type 2 diabetes. The present study was designed to determine whether gliclazide, a second-generation sulfonylurea, could directly act on skeletal muscle to enhance insulin signaling. Insulin stimulation results in the activation of two distinct pathways involved in metabolic regulation: the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) pathway and the mitogenic signaling pathway [mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway]. The PI 3 -kinase pathway (Farese, 2001) and, more recently, p 38 MAPK activation have been implicated in glucose uptake (Konrad et al., 2001; Somwar et al., 2000, 2001 a). Insulin has been shown to activate p 38 in skeletal muscle cells (Somwar et al., 2000). In the present study, the effect of gliclazide was also studied on the IR downstream pathway and on all three MAPKs (p 38 MAPK, JNK and ERK) ...|$|E
40|$|The fibrinolytic {{activity}} of blood is {{to a large}} extent determined by the plasma level of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Changes in the plasma level of t-PA are mainly achieved by the endothelium by two mechanisms: (a) a rapid, short-term release of t-PA, which occurs within minutes (acute release, regulated secretion) and (b) a long-term change in the rate of synthesis and constitutive secretion of t-PA. The rapid t-PA release response of the endothelium upon stimulation may {{play an important role in}} the dissolution of fibrin at the initial event of fibrin formation, and hence in the prevention of thrombus formation. The rate of constitutive t-PA secretion is an important determinant of the actual levels of t-PA under basal and stimulated conditions.

In this review we summarize our present knowledge about the factors, including intracellular signalling pathways, promoter elements and transcription factors involved in the modulation of t-PA gene expression, with particular reference to the regulation in human endothelial cells.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} (MD) simulation {{has been}} widely used in understanding the physical basis of the structure and function of biological macromolecules. However, its application in pharmaceutical research is still at an early stage. This dissertation attempts to establish the use of MD simulation in studying several important pharmaceutical mass transfer processes. The three-series study included (1) the understanding of drug crystal dissolution at molecular level, (2) the elucidation of an unique mechanism for facile polymorphic transformation of crystalline drugs in solutions, and (3) the determination of drug-polymer interactions at water-crystal interface and the implications to crystallization inhibition. A drug crystal dissolution into aqueous solution was simulated successfully {{for the first time}} on acetaminophen crystal Form I. The results revealed distinct corner 2 Ì 6 edge effect and differentiated dissolution rate among the three crystal surfaces of (001), (101) and (100), which correlated strongly with total interaction energies among the drug molecules and between the drug and water molecules. This study helped us gain additional fundamental understanding in the relationship between dissolution rate and particle size and morphology. A series of MD simulations and experimental methods were utilized to evaluate the thermodynamic and kinetic forces that control the polymorphic transformation in solutions. Acetaminophen Form II, a metastable crystalline form which readily converts to the themodymically stable Form I when in contact with solution was studied. It was found that the facile polymorphic transformation is not attributed to the solubility differences; rather it is caused by a unique mechanism of surface facilitated phase transformation (SurFPT). This new mechanism is able to promote faster polymorphic transformation than the well-known mechanism of solution-mediated phase transformation (SMPT), thus it is more detrimental. In the third study, the molecular mechanism of crystal surface specific drug-polymer interaction was investigated by simulating <b>tolazamide</b> crystals in the presence of hydrated PEG-b-PLA, a diblock copolymer. The results from the simulations demonstrated the polymer 2 Ì 7 s strong interaction with the (001) face, weaker interaction with the (010) face and minimal to no interaction with the (100) face, which matched remarkably well with the reported crystal habit alteration by the preferential interaction of PEG-b-PLA primarily with the (001) and partially with (010).

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{is unclear}} whether people with type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus on insulin monotherapy who do not achieve adequate glycaemic control should continue insulin as monotherapy or can benefit from adding oral glucose-lowering agents to the insulin therapy. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of insulin monotherapy compared {{with the addition of}} oral glucose-lowering agents to insulin monotherapy for people with type 2 diabetes already on insulin therapy and inadequate glycaemic control. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials. gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and reference lists of articles. The date of the last search was November 2015 for all databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled clinical trials of at least two months' duration comparing insulin monotherapy with combinations of insulin with one or more oral glucose-lowering agent in people with type 2 diabetes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, extracted data and evaluated overall quality of the evidence using GRADE. We summarised data statistically if they were available, sufficiently similar and of sufficient quality. We performed statistical analyses according to the statistical guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. MAIN RESULTS: We included 37 trials with 40 treatment comparisons involving 3227 participants. The duration of the interventions ranged from 2 to 12 months for parallel trials and two to four months for cross-over trials. The majority of trials had an unclear risk of bias in several risk of bias domains. Fourteen trials showed a high risk of bias, mainly for performance and detection bias. Insulin monotherapy, including once-daily long-acting, once-daily intermediate-acting, twice-daily premixed insulin, and basal-bolus regimens (multiple injections), was compared to insulin in combination with sulphonylureas (17 comparisons: glibenclamide = 11, glipizide = 2, <b>tolazamide</b> = 2, gliclazide = 1, glimepiride = 1), metformin (11 comparisons), pioglitazone (four comparisons), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (four comparisons: acarbose = 3, miglitol = 1), dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitors (DPP- 4 inhibitors) (three comparisons: vildagliptin = 1, sitagliptin = 1, saxagliptin = 1) and the combination of metformin and glimepiride (one comparison). No trials assessed all-cause mortality, diabetes-related morbidity or health-related quality of life. Only one trial assessed patients' treatment satisfaction and showed no substantial differences between the addition of either glimepiride or metformin and glimepiride to insulin compared with insulin monotherapy. Insulin-sulphonylurea combination therapy (CT) compared with insulin monotherapy (IM) showed a MD in glycosylated haemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) of - 1 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) - 1. 6 to - 0. 5); P < 0. 01; 316 participants; 9 trials; low-quality evidence. Insulin-metformin CT compared with IM showed a MD in HbA 1 c of - 0. 9 % (95 % CI - 1. 2 to - 0. 5); P < 0. 01; 698 participants; 9 trials; low-quality evidence. We could not pool the results of adding pioglitazone to insulin. Insulin combined with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors compared with IM showed a MD in HbA 1 c of - 0. 4 % (95 % CI - 0. 5 to - 0. 2); P < 0. 01; 448 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence). Insulin combined with DPP- 4 inhibitors compared with IM showed a MD in HbA 1 c of - 0. 4 % (95 % CI - 0. 5 to - 0. 4); P < 0. 01; 265 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence. In most trials the participants with CT needed less insulin, whereas insulin requirements increased or remained stable in participants with IM. We did not perform a meta-analysis for hypoglycaemic events because the included studies used different definitions [...] In most trials the insulin-sulphonylurea combination resulted in a higher number of mild episodes of hypoglycaemia, compared to the IM group (range: 2. 2 to 6. 1 episodes per participant in CT versus 2. 0 to 2. 6 episodes per participant in IM; low-quality evidence). Pioglitazone CT also resulted in more mild to moderate hypoglycaemic episodes compared with IM (range 15 to 90 episodes versus 9 to 75 episodes, respectively; low-quality evidence. The trials that reported hypoglycaemic episodes in the other combinations found comparable numbers of mild to moderate hypoglycaemic events (low-quality evidence). The addition of sulphonylureas resulted in an additional weight gain of 0. 4 kg to 1. 9 kg versus - 0. 8 kg to 2. 1 kg in the IM group (220 participants; 7 trials; low-quality evidence). Pioglitazone CT caused more weight gain compared to IM: MD 3. 8 kg (95 % CI 3. 0 to 4. 6); P < 0. 01; 288 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence. Metformin CT was associated with weight loss: MD - 2. 1 kg (95 % CI - 3. 2 to - 1. 1), P < 0. 01; 615 participants; 7 trials; low-quality evidence). DPP- 4 inhibitors CT showed weight gain of - 0. 7 to 1. 3 kg versus 0. 6 to 1. 1 kg in the IM group (362 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence). Alpha-glucosidase CT compared to IM showed a MD of - 0. 5 kg (95 % CI - 1. 2 to 0. 3); P = 0. 26; 241 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence. Users of metformin CT (range 7 % to 67 % versus 5 % to 16 %), and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors CT (14 % to 75 % versus 4 % to 35 %) experienced more gastro-intestinal adverse effects compared to participants on IM. Two trials reported a higher frequency of oedema with the use of pioglitazone CT (range: 16 % to 18 % versus 4 % to 7 % IM). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The addition of all oral glucose-lowering agents in people with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycaemic control who are on insulin therapy has positive effects on glycaemic control and insulin requirements. The addition of sulphonylureas results in more hypoglycaemic events. Additional weight gain can only be avoided by adding metformin to insulin. Other well-known adverse effects of oral glucose-lowering agents have {{to be taken into account}} when prescribing oral glucose-lowering agents in addition to insulin therapy...|$|E
