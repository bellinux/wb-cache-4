40|$|The {{goal of the}} <b>TeleAction</b> {{project is}} to allow an online {{community}} to collaboratively and remotely experience and interact with a real-world environment. In recent years, the rise of “reality ” TV, featuring unscripted filming of ongoing events and (limited) audience participation, demonstrates that such programming attracts a sizeable audience. Television media, by its nature, is strikingly one-sided, and viewers of such reality TV shows cannot directly interact with the broadcast. Even online, real-world broadcasts via Web-Cam are view-only, which {{is at odds with}} the rich interactive experience of online games and social spaces. <b>TeleAction</b> represents a new paradigm in television broadcasting. We combine an interactive social interface with a broadcast from the real world, and give the community within this online space the ability to direct a live Actor in the real world. With <b>TeleAction,</b> we turn viewers into Directors, and give them a strong sense of “being there, ” as their directions cause real actions to be enacted in the remote location.

Multi-modal telepresence systems are to enable human operators to become present and active in remote or inaccessible environments through a communication network and a suitable telerobotic system. The major challenges of such a multimodal telepresence system like stabilizing measures, and transparency, e. g. in the case of time-delay (latency) in the communication network, are discussed. A practical implementation of an integrated mobile and bimanual multi-user telepresence and <b>teleaction</b> system as well as some exemplary experiments are presented.

40|$|Broadband {{integrated}} services digital networks (BISDN) {{are designed to}} {{offer a variety of}} services with bit rates ranging from several kb/s (e. g. <b>teleactions)</b> to hundreds of Mb/s (e. g. HDTV), and in some cases approaching Gb/s (e. g. in interconnections of high-speed LANs). A multiplicity of rates and the burstiness of traffic sources lead naturally to systems based on the fast packet switching (or asynchronous transfer mode) concept. The requirements of data buffering and high-speed processing of packet headers have resulted in a plethora of proposals for ATM switching nodes and an equal number of ways for evaluating them. In particular, the class of non-blocking architectures of ATM switches has received the most attention from the research community. This paper reviews this class of architecture with emphasis on contention resolution methods and communication traffic performance. The contention resolution methods are divided into four categories: input buffering, output buffering, shared buffering, and hybrid buffering. The communication traffic characteristics are divided into two categories: uniform traffic and bursty traffic...|$|R

This paper presents an approach that reduces haptic data traffic in networked telepresence and <b>teleaction</b> systems to {{a small fraction of the}} original rate without impairing performance by using fast Kalman filters on the input signals combined with model based prediction of haptic signals.

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for the transmission of haptic data in telepresence and <b>teleaction</b> systems. The goal of this work {{is to reduce the}} packet rate between an operator and a teleoperator without impairing the immersiveness of the system. Our approach exploits the properties of human haptic perception and is, more specifically, based on the concept of just noticeable differences. In our scheme, updates of the haptic amplitude values are signaled across the network only if the change of a haptic stimulus is detectable by the human operator. We investigate haptic data communication for a 1 degree-of-freedom and a 3 degree-of-freedom <b>teleaction</b> system. Our experimental results show that the presented approach is able to reduce the packet rate between the operator and teleoperator by up to 90 % of the original rate without affecting the performance of the system...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} and immersiveness of telepresence and <b>teleaction</b> systems critically {{depend on the}} quality of the communication between the operator and the teleoperator. High packet rate for low delay data exchange in internet-based teleoperation is one of the major challenges in this context. A psychophysically motivated data reduction scheme, earlier presented by the authors, solves this problem by the use of signal amplitude dependent deadband quantization. This scheme successfully limits the amount of transmitted packets, but as soon as the size of the deadband exceeds a certain limit, noticeable and disturbing artifacts are introduced into the haptic signals. In this paper, we present a novel signal reconstruction technique, based on a signal adaptive synthesis filter. It removes discontinuities in the displayed signals and enables the use of strong deadband based data reduction without perceptible disturbance in the telepresence system.

This approach has been extended to three dimensions resulting in an additional perceptual domain- namely force direction. An experimental evaluation with human subjects was conducted {{in order to examine}} the change of the JND in 3 D when force magnitude and force direction are combined.

40|$|In {{telepresence}} and <b>teleaction</b> systems the haptic {{communication channel}} plays a central role. As it closes a global control loop any introduced communication delay possibly destabilizes {{the system and}} impairs the performance. The scattering theory is known to solve these stability issues by transmitting wave variables instead of haptic signals, i. e. force and velocity, over the communication channel. For stability and performance additionally high packet rates are required stressing the underlying network resources. Perceptual coding techniques of haptic signals, such as the Weberinspired deadband approach, are known to successfully reduce the packet rate on the haptic channel. However, as wave variables do not directly represent haptic information but a linear transformation of both signals, perceptual coding is not directly applicable anymore.

To the authors’ best knowledge, {{it is the first}} attempt to integrate mobile and multi-robot strategies in one physical and logical framework. In order to exploit human manipulation capabilities, a high fidelity telemanipulation system was developed. It consists of two redundant human-scaled anthropomorphic telemanipulator arms controlled by two redundant haptic interfaces providing a large, convex workspace and force feedback {{in a wide range of}} human perception. To provide a multi modal immersion, the haptic modality is augmented by 3 D visual and audio channels. The main research issues are the control of devices with dissimilar kinematics, redundancy resolution methods, and six DOF compliance control. To extend the accessible workspace in remote environments, mobile robots are used as transporting platform extending the functionality of both the input devices and the telerobot. Mechatronic design topics and experimental results of six degree of freedom telemanipulation tasks and mobile telemanipulation are presented.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a new mobile haptic {{interface}} for unconstrained bimanual manipulation is presented. This device, which has been developed at the High-Fidelity Telepresence and <b>Teleaction</b> Research Centre, Munich, Germany, allows locomotion and haptic interaction at the same time. In contrast to most existing haptic interfaces, it is therefore not restricted to desktop applications but also enables bimanual manipulation tasks with high interaction forces in extended remote or virtual environments. The design of this mobile haptic interface {{is based on a}} modular system consisting of two components: two haptic interfaces and a mobile platform. While the haptic interfaces only cover parts of the human arm workspace, the mobile platform extends these to arbitrarily large remote environments. A special design and control concept of the haptic interfaces makes it possible to decouple translational from rotational movements. This decoupling helps to significantly simplify the control algorithms which handle the interaction between the single components. The mobile platform which carries the two haptic interfaces must be positioned {{in such a way that}} the manipulability of both haptic interfaces is maximized. Different optimization strategies are presented and compared. The motion of the mobile platform must be synchronized with the control of the haptic interfaces in order to hide the platform motion from the operator.

40|$|A key {{challenge}} facing 3 D interface designers, and operators who teleoperate remote environments {{is to develop}} effective techniques to depict objects in 3 D space on a 2 -dimensional physical medium; a flat computer screen. Spatial relationships among objects, their sizes and locations are of high importance for users {{in order to be}} able to locate and manipulate these objects. In particular, depth perception (z dimension) is a main challenge for researchers who have designed many depth cues in order to overcome it. The main trend of providing depth perception is stereoscopy; other approaches utilize shading and shadow, motion, reference frames, size, perspective and others. These visual cues, including stereoscopy, have certain limitations. In this work, we propose to exploit human sensory modality for perceiving depth in teleoperated 3 D environments where complex visual information - which may distract the operator - is presented. We exploit the funneling illusion phenomenon to provide a high resolution tactile depth display on the forearm. It utilizes stimulus location perception rather than stimulus intensity perception. One psychophysical experiment is conducted to study the resolution of the funneling illusion method on the forearm, and another experiment to evaluate its performance in a Telepresence and <b>teleaction</b> (TPTA) system scenario where a fragile dangerous object is being manipulated.

40|$|International audienceFor {{some people}} with motor disabilities and speech disorders, {{the only way to}} {{communicate}} and to have some control over their environment is {{through the use of a}} controlled scanning system operated by a single switch. The main problem with these systems is that the communication process tends to be exceedingly slow, since the system must scan through the available choices one at a time until the desired message is reached. One way of raising the speed of message selection is to optimize the elementary scanning delay in real time so that it allows the user to make selections as quickly as possible without making too many errors. With this objective in mind, this article presents a method for optimizing the scanning delay, which is based on an analysis of the data recorded in “log files” while applying the EDiTH system [Digital <b>Teleaction</b> Environment for People with Disabilities]. This analysis makes it possible to develop a human-machine interaction model specific to the study, and then to establish an adaptive algorithm for the calculation of the scanning delay. The results obtained with imposed scenarios and then in ecological situations provides a confirmation that our algorithms are effective in dynamically adapting a scan speed. The main advantage offered by the procedure proposed is that it works on timing information alone and thus does not require any knowledge of the scanning device itself. This allows it to work with any scanning device...|$|E
40|$|Using rhetorical {{criticism}} {{informed by}} actor-network theory (ANT), in this dissertation I explore {{the emergence of}} queer identity and queer community building within the Objectùm Sexuality Internationale Web site (OSI) —the largest source of information related to a community of over 300 hundred individuals who experience emotional and romantic desire towards objects. My goals {{in this study are}} (1) to identify and understand how rhetorical strategies are emergent and networked (rather than individually enacted) within the OSI Web site; and (2) how these emergent rhetorical strategies promote multiplicity of sexual desire and identity through the challenging of heteronormative and anthropocentric binaries and normativities via queer posthuman forms of love and connection. Using an ANT informed rhetorical criticism, I identified four layers of communication that facilitate the emergence of actor networks within the OSI Web site: (1) translation—the process by which human actors depict experience in texts); (2) enactment—the process by which actors (human and object) interact in ways that create networks of action and agency); (3) representation—the process in which certain macroactors (actors that appear as recurring and stable categories) present the interests of other actors within the network); and (4) teleaction—the movement of representations from place to place and over time through memory and text. Within these layers, I identified four categories of translation, thirteen macroactors, and four types of <b>teleaction.</b> The translations that emerge on the OSI Web site include how objectùm sexuality became a term and community, {{what it means to be}} objectùm sexual, how people who identify as objectùm sexual have come to make sense of their experiences, and public pleas for acceptance regarding objectùm sexuality. The macroactors that emerge include people, communication devices, purposes of OSI, orientation, animism, sensuality/intimacy, nonverbal communication, love, gender, attraction, marriage, medicalization, and the Red Fence. The processes of <b>teleaction</b> that emerge include verbal, nonverbal, hybrid, and symbolic actors. These four layers then led to the emergence of four higher-level rhetorical dimensions. These include: (1) terminological dimension— the interrelationship between terms and the OS community; (2) ontological dimension—the emergence of a higher-level philosophy about the existence of beings and the meanings and modes of being, existing, living, and loving for OS; (3) axiological dimension—the emergence of criteria for ethical values and judgments in relation to OS; and (4) epistemological dimension—where the dimensions of ontology and terminology meet and the nature and scope of knowledge about OS is represented. Together, these four transcendent levels facilitate the rhetorical construction of the OS community and critiques of heteronormative/anthropocentric frames of love, desire, and sexuality. Overall, these various strategies lead to two larger rhetorical moves: (1) OSI communicates and adapts to internal and external audiences; and (2) OSI rhetoric moves from specific meanings to larger paradigmatic shifts that reveal is function as a social movement within a single rhetorical text. This process of rhetorical strategy building positions OS within intelligible frameworks of understanding in order to: (1) provide information about OS that will mitigate fear and sensationalism and facilitate acceptance; (2) construct an OSI community identity and human-object desire more generally; and (3) direct people away from heteronormative and anthropocentric worldviews and toward a queer posthuman worldviews of love, desire, and connection.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{and extend the}} concept of model-mediated {{teleoperation}} (MMT) for <b>teleaction</b> systems which provide live video feedback from the remote side with a time delay. In MMT, the haptic feedback is rendered locally on the operator side using a simple object surface model {{in order to keep}} the haptic control loop stable in the presence of communication delays. Because the live video from the remote side is received with delay, this results in a visual-haptic asynchrony for the displayed interaction events. In ad-dition, sudden model parameter updates can lead to “model-jump” effects for the displayed haptic feedback. Both effects degrade the user experience and system performance. To address these issues, we propose an extension of MMT which we call model-displaced teleoperation (MDT) in this paper. In MDT, we adaptively shift the position of the local surface model to delay the haptic contact with the environment, thus compensating the visual-haptic asyn-chrony and avoiding the model-jump effect. As the haptic feed-back is still rendered locally, the advantages of the MMT approach are retained and instabilities in the haptic interaction are avoided. In our experiments, we determine the optimal displacement com-promise between visual-haptic asynchrony, the model-jump effect and perceived distance errors. Moreover, the subjective experience and objective task performance of the proposed MDT and the orig-inal MMT for a teleoperation setup with soft objects are evaluated. Our results show that the users prefer the MDT method compared to MMT once the communication delay between the teleoperator and the operator exceeds 50 ms. In addition, the task error rate is reduced by about 50 % and the subjects are better able to control their contact force for system delays larger than 50 ms if the MDT method is employed.
