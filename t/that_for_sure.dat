Redfoo said, [...] "I feel like we've {{been doing this for}} so long, four or five years" [...] and that he and SkyBlu would not be performing together anytime soon as they would be taking their careers in different directions. Once the news surfaced that band members Redfoo and SkyBlu had split, the group went to MTV News to set the record straight. SkyBlu said, [...] "Well, you know, first of all, we're not breaking up. I know <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure.</b> We're family and stuff, so it's always love ... It's interesting because somebody will say one thing [...] it's just like high school, {{then all of a sudden}} [...] 'They're breaking up. They're fighting.'" [...] However, it has been revealed by SkyBlu that their plan is for fans to see the band as individuals and then come back stronger than ever.|$|E

5000|$|At a 2002 fund-raiser Klein joked, [...] "You know, my {{science is}} limited to the fact that I know that eons ago there was an ice age.

5000|$|Most of the {{references}} cited by von Tunzelmann consist of books by other people, but she apparently has read {{enough to satisfy}} her curiosity on questions that have confounded other historians, like when, exactly, Fidel Castro actually became a Communist. She declares flatly that when he announced in 1961 that he had long been a Marxist-Leninist in secret, [...] "it was not accurate. It was meant to impress the Soviets." [...] Maybe, {{but we do not}} know <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure.</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{arguing for}} the {{objectivity}} of truth, Turek then argues for the objectivity of knowledge. He asks {{those who argue}} that one cannot know anything for sure if they can know <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure.</b> If they can, then the statement is self-defeating. If they cannot, then it calls the legitimacy of that position into question. Turek concludes by saying that people cannot be skeptics about everything, because then they would have to doubt skepticism. However, the more they doubt skepticism, the more sure they become.|$|E

5000|$|Following Albion's relegation to the Championship {{after just}} one season, Valero said that he {{intended}} to remain at the club: [...] "I still have a three-year contract here and would like to be true to <b>that.</b> <b>For</b> <b>sure</b> playing in the second division is not ideal. But if I {{have to put up with}} it then I am going to put up with it." [...] By the beginning of the next campaign, however, he had changed his mind: [...] "I prefer to play in Mallorca and not to be in the second division in England. This is clear. I am disposed for a loan return but it is necessary for an accord between the clubs".|$|E
5000|$|Like {{the other}} {{songs on the}} soundtrack, [...] "Guaranteed" [...] {{is based on the}} story of American {{wanderer}} Christopher McCandless. After graduating as a top student from Emory University in 1990, McCandless decided to give up all of his savings and money and travel across the United States. In April 1992, McCandess hitchhiked to Alaska to live in the wilderness with little food and equipment, hoping to live a period of solitude. Nearly five months later, he died of starvation near Denali National Park and Preserve. Director Sean Penn said that as soon as he heard the song he [...] "just felt <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> this is the musical voice of (actor) Emile (Hirsch's) character." [...] Eddie Vedder has said that the lyrics [...] "Don't come closer or I'll have to go/Owning me like gravity are places that pull/If ever there was someone to keep me at home/It would be you" [...] are for McCandless' sister, Carine.|$|E
5000|$|Commenting on {{the goal}} at the time, Manchester United's manager Sir Alex Ferguson stated,"I've never seen {{anything}} like it, <b>that's</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure.</b> Absolutely stunning. Unbelievable. The thing about that goal is that Nani's goal will be completely forgotten and it was a fantastic goal. His first touch takes it around the defender and he rolled it into the net. It was an unbelievable goal but no-one in their right sense will even talk about it!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Busch said {{afterwards}} {{that winning}} at Kansas was [...] "pretty big - man, there’s {{been a lot}} of rough days here at Kansas, <b>that’s</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure.</b> A lot of good ones too, but I just can’t say enough about this team and everyone on this M&M’s Camry.

5000|$|Farrell Spence {{delivers}} {{an album}} of sweet backwoods ballads charting the claustrophobic relationships and stunted dreams of isolated prairie town life: [...] "Nothing ever happens in a town called hell". She's no Judith Chalmers <b>that's</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure.</b> It has a dusty wind blown lonesome flavour with clear and crisp playing of acoustic and steel guitar and occasional fiddle; sweet sounding {{but at the same}} time an indie album that steers clear of schmaltz and over production.

5000|$|Although A Chrystall Glasse is a biography, {{numerous}} {{scholars and}} critics {{agree that it}} is not one that is completely unbiased and without motives. Insight into the text can be obtained by reading from economic, religious, and feminist perspectives. Philip Stubbs, as the author of the work, sets himself up as the narrator, giving the feel of objectivity. However, even though it claims to have copied her work verbatim, we cannot know <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure,</b> since the text is not written down by the woman herself: she is merely represented by her husband. The work is seen as an exaggerated portrayal of Katherine, which indicates that her husband had further motivation for publishing the work than simply as a dedication to her memory—Katherine {{was meant to be a}} model of the ideal early modern Protestant woman. From an economic perspective, in the age of emergent capitalism, Katherine was also held up by her husband as a contrast and critique of the “bourgeois women consumers who offered her a world of goods—fine food, prideful apparel, and plays.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Fader, Kelela discussed the inspiration behind each of the songs on Hallucinogen. [...] "A Message" [...] and [...] "Hallucinogen" [...] were recorded at the same session with Arca before Cut 4 Me was finished. She wanted to wait on sharing the Arca stuff because she [...] "wanted {{to go all the}} way with them." [...] "A Message" [...] reflects on a relationship that, at that time, had just ended. It's about taking responsibility for how you participated in a relationship and to use the experience to create something completely new for myself. She wrote the song with Arca and then took it to her long-time collaborator and friend Mocky. She stated that most of the time she's [...] "thinking about who's gonna help me evoke the most feelings. Alejandro definitely does <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure,</b> and Mocky and I also have that rapport. We can talk about the hardest part of the hard thing to talk about." [...] The second track, [...] "Gomenasai" [...] came from a conversation Kelela had with Nguzunguzu's Asma Maroof about a documentary which discusses black women in popular music for the past 50 years and how they've been discriminated against. Kelela started working on the song over Christmas break in 2014. She wrote most of the song herself, with Sam Dew writing [...] "a little part" [...] as well. Producer Ariel Rechtshaid later helped to [...] "bring it to another level." [...] The song is [...] "a narrative of a woman being the dominant person is the bedroom, but also dealing with someone who doesn't necessarily represent what you think of as a bottom. So, an alpha male who is being dominated by a powerful woman. Essentially, it drives the point home of a powerful man who always wants to be dominated by a powerful woman." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked about}} his laid-back approach, and his calm and {{contented}} demeanor, he commented, [...] "I {{got a letter from}} somebody here a while back, and they said, 'Bob, everything in your world seems to be happy.' <b>That's</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>That's</b> why I paint. It's because I can create the kind of world that I want, and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Shoot, if you want bad stuff, watch the news." ...|$|R

We'd just eat as much as humanly possible and hopefully we'd eat at the show, but we had absolutely no spending money.

5000|$|Bashur's no {{vacation}} spot, <b>that's</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure.</b> It's dusty when it's not raining {{and noisy}} day and night. Camp life revolved around long workdays.

The latrines - deep trenches in a field {{in full view of}} departing planes - were a 300-yard hike from the camp. A visit to the latrines became [...] "the walk of shame."

Dyes are worldwide used for many different scopes: from textile to pharmaceutical uses, the global demand of dyes is obviously linked to the general disposal of effluents with colorants <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> affect environmental equilibrium.
