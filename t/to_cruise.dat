5|$|In late April 1800, Confiance cruised off Sunda Strait, {{where she}} {{captured}} an American ship; she {{then left the}} strait to avoid the frigate , which was known <b>to</b> <b>cruise</b> in these waters, and sailed to the Seychelles. There, he escaped a British ship {{of the line and}} a frigate, and sailed on <b>to</b> <b>cruise</b> the Bay of Bengal.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{passenger}} pier in the Port of Ashdod. The traffic at this gateway is constantly growing, especially due <b>to</b> <b>cruise</b> ship activities. The other sea gateway is Blue Marina.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{supplying}} {{air to the}} engine, {{the intake}} also supplied air through the ramp bleed to the propelling nozzle. The nozzle ejector (or aerodynamic) design, with variable exit area and secondary flow from the intake, contributed to good expansion efficiency from take-off <b>to</b> <b>cruise.</b>|$|E

2500|$|On February 25, 1934, {{she made}} her last {{crossing}} on a regular line for the White Star between Boston, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Halifax, and Liverpool. She was then assigned <b>to</b> <b>cruises.</b> In March of that year, she transported 700 pilgrims from Dublin to Rome for the Easter celebrations. Many unnecessary ships were sold in the following years, but the Laurentic was retained and temporarily assigned to the Montreal route before returning <b>to</b> <b>cruising.</b>|$|R
5|$|Turbines {{also had}} disadvantages. At {{cruising}} speeds much slower than maximum speed, turbines were markedly less fuel-efficient than reciprocating engines. This was {{particularly important for}} navies which required a long range at cruising speeds—and hence for the US Navy, which was planning {{in the event of}} war <b>to</b> <b>cruise</b> across the Pacific and engage the Japanese in the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August 25, and ultimately discontinued {{about three days}} later. Two cruise ships left Bermuda early to avoid the storm, and another two postponed their scheduled stops there. The threat of the storm, combined {{with a lack of}} passengers due <b>to</b> <b>cruise</b> ship diversions, resulted in the suspension of ferry service. Cristobal ultimately passed well to the northwest of the island, producing breezy conditions and heightened surf.|$|E
5|$|After {{a five-year}} retirement, in early 1807, Surcouf ordered the 18-gun Revenant, a {{privateer}} {{which he had}} built on his own specifications. On 2 March, he departed Saint-Malo with a 192-man crew <b>to</b> <b>cruise</b> off Bengal. On 9 March 1807, while en route, off Madeira, Revenant captured the British slave ship Aun, of sixteen 12-pounders, recently departed from Liverpool, which Surcouf let go for a ransom, after throwing her guns overboard, wetting her gunpowder and destroying some of her sails.|$|E

5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was <b>to</b> <b>cruise</b> behind his opponents {{and hope that}} they crashed, as he realised {{that he could not}} match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his chance of being caught in a collision and falling.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 the 36-year-old QE2 was {{replaced}} on the North Atlantic by Queen Mary 2. Caronia was sold and QE2 continued <b>to</b> <b>cruise</b> {{until she was}} retired in 2008. In 2007 Cunard added a large cruise ship, Queen Victoria. She is not a sister for the QM2, being ordered by Carnival as a Vista class cruise ship for the Holland America Line. To reinforce Cunard traditions, the QV has a small museum on board. Cunard commissioned a second Vista class cruise ship, Queen Elizabeth, in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Official {{interest}} in Hurst Castle increased {{again in the}} 1840s, as the introduction of shell guns and steam ships created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast. Previously, sailing ships had been only able to pass the castle slowly when moving against the tide, making them vulnerable to its guns; steam ships threatened <b>to</b> <b>cruise</b> past at speed. Military estimates and surveys in 1850 and 1851 suggested that the armament should therefore be significantly increased, to include more and much heavier guns.|$|E

5|$|The Hokies {{struggled}} back in {{the third}} quarter, scoring six unanswered points to close the score to 3516. In the fourth quarter, however, Tennessee answered Virginia Tech's effort with 10points, putting the game {{out of reach for}} the Hokies, who managed only a single touchdown in the fourth quarter. The Hokies fumbled the ball five times—losing it once—and threw twointerceptions, allowing Tennessee <b>to</b> <b>cruise</b> to an easy victory, 4523. Tennessee running back James Stewart was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Flambeau brought further acclaim to Shaw, {{who had already}} {{defeated}} several other French privateers and taken them as prizes. Enterprise continued her cruise, next chasing down and capturing Pauline and later Guadaloupeenne. Shortly afterward, chronic illness forced Shaw to transfer command of the vessel to Lieutenant Andrew Sterett. Sterret continued <b>to</b> <b>cruise</b> the Caribbean, taking several more prizes before returning home. Upon Shaw's return home the president and other public officials personally thanked him for his service. Shaw later continued his naval career, serving with distinction during the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|Although the Ligurian Sea was by {{this stage}} largely French {{territorial}} waters, after the Royal Navy had destroyed the French Mediterranean Fleet at the Battle of the Nile off Egypt in 1798, the British in fact controlled {{it and the}} whole Mediterranean Sea. By 1801 British bases at Gibraltar, Menorca and Malta allowed British naval forces <b>to</b> <b>cruise</b> throughout the sea largely unopposed; their presence forced {{the remnants of the}} French fleet based at Toulon to make short journeys between French bases to avoid interception and capture. It was therefore not until a large French squadron under Rear-Admiral Honoré Ganteaume briefly asserted regional naval superiority that a French expeditionary force was able to secure Elba. They sailed from Piombino on 2 May 1801 with 1,500 men under General Jean Victor Tharreau, who landed unopposed at the Neapolitan town of Porto Longone.|$|E

Also in 2007 the Zenith was transferred <b>to</b> Pullmantur <b>Cruises</b> 'in exchange' for the Azamara ships. Transfer of the Zenith also meant the end of Celebrity Cruises' association with Bermuda for the time being, as no ship was brought in to replace her on the <b>cruises</b> <b>to</b> Bermuda. In April 2010, The Celebrity Summit reposition yearly to New Jersey and offers <b>cruises</b> <b>to</b> Bermuda.|$|R
50|$|In December 1996, Regent Rainbow {{was sold}} <b>to</b> Louis <b>Cruise</b> Lines and renamed The Emerald. In 1997, she was {{chartered}} <b>to</b> Thomson <b>Cruises</b> <b>to</b> operate <b>cruises</b> for the British market. During her time with Thomson {{she became the}} company's most popular ship, and remained in service with them until October 2008, when she was dropped {{in favor of a}} larger, more modern and economical vessel. Hereafter, she saw limited further service for Louis until 2009, when the company announced that she was being laid up and most likely would not sail again.|$|R
5|$|Between 7 June and 26 August, New Jersey formed part of {{the first}} {{training}} squadron <b>to</b> <b>cruise</b> Northern European waters since the beginning of World War II. Over two thousand United States Naval Academy and NROTC midshipmen received seagoing experience under the command of Admiral Richard L. Connolly, Commander Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, who broke his flag in New Jersey at Rosyth, Scotland 23 June. She was the scene of official receptions at Oslo, where King Haakon VII of Norway inspected the crew 2 July, and at Portsmouth, England. The training fleet was westward bound 18 July for exercises in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|By April 4, {{the fleet}} reached {{the waters off}} Long Island and {{proceeded}} to capture , which was also laden with supplies. The next day brought a second prize in the Bolton. Hopkins continued <b>to</b> <b>cruise</b> off Block Island that night, hoping to catch more easy prizes. He organized the fleet into a scouting formation of two columns. The right or eastern column was headed by USS Cabot and was followed by Hopkins' flagship USS Alfred, which had 20 guns and was the largest ship of the fleet. The left column was headed by the USS Andrew Doria and was followed by USS Columbus. Behind these came USS Providence, with USS Fly and USS Wasp trailing farther behind as escorts for the prizes. The need to provide crews for the prize ships further reduced the fighting effectiveness of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Discovering on 24 December {{that the}} French squadrons {{had broken out}} of Brest, Barham {{despatched}} two squadrons in pursuit, led by Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan and Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren. A third squadron detached from the blockade of Cadiz without orders, under its commander Rear-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth, all three British forces cruising the mid-Atlantic {{in search of the}} French. Following a brief encounter with Willaumez, Duckworth sailed to the Caribbean and there discovered and destroyed Leissegues' squadron at the Battle of San Domingo in February 1806. With one of the French squadrons eliminated, Strachan and Warren remained in the mid-Atlantic anticipating Willaumez's return from his operations to the south. Warren's squadron was ordered <b>to</b> <b>cruise</b> in the Eastern Atlantic, in the region of the island of Madeira, directly across Linois's line of advance.|$|E

5|$|During the Quasi-War American {{merchant}} ships often {{became the}} target of French privateers who seized them in large quantities. In an effort to stem these depredations against American shipping several United States Navy warships were dispatched to hunt down French privateers.

Enterprise had been sent out to the Caribbean Sea in March 1800 with orders <b>to</b> <b>cruise</b> against French shipping in the region.

The following day, the ships cut submarine telegraph cables between Imbros, Tenedos, Lemnos, Salonica, and the Dardanelles. The ships then steamed to {{the entrance to the}} Dardanelles in an attempt to lure out the Ottoman fleet. When the Ottoman coastal fortifications began to take the Italian ships under fire, the Italians returned fire and inflicted serious damage on them.
