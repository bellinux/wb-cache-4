5|$|The {{chemistry}} of polonium {{is similar to}} that of tellurium, although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor bismuth due to its metallic character. Polonium dissolves readily in dilute acids but is only slightly soluble in alkalis. Polonium solutions are first colored in pink by the Po2+ ions, but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po2+ into Po4+. This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by glassware due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result, polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed. At pH about 1, polonium ions are readily hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as oxalic acid, citric acid, and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E

The disease {{was known to}} be caused by contact with fresh water inhabited by certain species of snails, and orders had been issued that prohibited bathing in fresh water, but the troops were slow to appreciate the danger involved. In its toxic phase, the disease was easily confused with typhus, so Fairley developed a complement fixation test for the disease {{along the lines of the}} Wassermann test. He studied its pathology, confirming that the worms in the circulatory system could be cured by intravenous <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid.</b> Fairley also studied, and later published papers on typhus, malaria, and bacillary dysentery.|$|E

5|$|In India, Fairley {{continued}} his research into schistosomiasis. The disease was unknown in India but snails were abundant {{and there was}} danger that troops returning from Egypt might introduce it. In the absence of human schistosoma, Fairley investigated bovine schistosoma, which infected water buffalo and other domesticated animals in the Bombay area. Experiments with monkeys proved that daily intravenous doses of <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> were an effective treatment. Fairley also carried out pioneering work on Guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis). However, his main interest was Tropical sprue.

25|$|<b>Tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> is, from a {{winemaking}} perspective, {{the most}} important in wine due to the prominent role it plays in maintaining the chemical stability of the wine and its color and finally in influencing {{the taste of the}} finished wine. In most plants, this organic acid is rare, but it is found in significant concentrations in grape vines. Along with malic acid, {{and to a lesser extent}} citric acid, tartaric is one of the fixed acids found in wine grapes. The concentration varies depending on grape variety and the soil content of the vineyard. Some varieties, such as Palomino, are naturally disposed to having high levels of tartaric acids, while Malbec and Pinot noir generally have lower levels. During flowering, high levels of <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> are concentrated in the grape flowers and then young berries. As the vine progresses through ripening, tartaric does not get metabolized through respiration like malic acid, so the levels of <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> in the grape vines remain relatively consistent throughout the ripening process.|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken {{in an attempt}} to prepare an explosive with certain satisfactory plastic and adhesive properties.

It was found that a satisfactory succinic acid - ethylene diamine polymer could be prepared, and could easily be nitrated. The product, though possessive of detonating qualities, was not adequately stable for use as a military explosive. DiffiCulties were encountered in the preparation of satisfactory polymers from maliC and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acids</b> with ethylene diamine, due to the presence of the substituent hydroxy groups.

40|$|Copyright © 2008 Australian Society of Viticulture and Oenology Inc. Biomineralisation in the fleshy {{pericarp}} of berries of Vitis vinifera L. {{gives rise}} to crystals of two distinct forms, viz. raphides and druses, which are found in exocarp and endocarp cells respectively. Druses have generally been considered as crystalline aggregates of calcium oxalate. However, the organic moiety of raphide crystals has been commonly accepted as tartrate, although we have found no analytical data to support that assumption. We now present TEM and X-ray powder diffraction analysis data showing that raphide crystals of V. vinifera berries are composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate. This work also established ascorbic acid as the biosynthetic precursor of both oxalic and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acids.</b> When ascorbic acid labelled with ¹⁴C at position 1 was introduced into berries via the rachis, 21 % and 52 % of the added radiolabel was recovered as oxalic and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acids</b> respectively.

40|$|Low {{temperature}} (165 &deg;C) Wet Oxidation (WO) and Catalytic Wet Oxidation (CWO) of 12 {{organic compounds}} {{has been studied}} in highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution (simulating that encountered in the Bayer process used to refine alumina) for the first time. Most (11 out of 12) of the 12 organic compounds studied (formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, citric, lactic, malic and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acids)</b> {{have been identified in}} various worldwide Bayer liquors. The various aspects of WO and CWO studied for each of the above-mentioned compounds were as follows; -Extent of complete oxidation to carbonate (i. e. extent of removal of organic compound) -Extent of overall oxidation (i. e. extent of complete oxidation and partial oxidation to stable products) -The product(s) formed from partial (incomplete) oxidation -The reaction mechanism occurring -Why certain compounds undergo low temperature WO and/or CWO in highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution -The ability of various transition metal oxides to catalyse the WO of the selected organic compounds Of the 12 organic compounds studied only six (formic, malonic, citric, lactic, malic and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acids)</b> underwent appreciable (&gt; 2 % overall oxidation) WO in isolation under the reaction conditions used (4. 4 - 7. 0 M NaOH, 165 &deg;C, 500 kPa Po₂, 2 hours). Each of these six compounds underwent some complete oxidation and therefore can be partly removed from highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution using low temperature WO. The order of extent of complete oxidation determined was as follows tartaric&gt; citric&gt; malonic&gt; formic&gt; lactic&gt; malic. All of these compounds also underwent some partial oxidation under the reaction conditions used, excluding formic acid, which only underwent complete oxidation. Oxalic acid was a major product of partial oxidation of all of the above-mentioned compounds (excluding formic acid), while acetic acid was a major product of partial oxidation of citric, lactic, malic and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acids.</b> The WO of formic, malonic, citric, lactic, malic and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acids</b> varied considerably with NaOH concentration over the NaOH concentration range studied (4. 4 - 7. 0 M). The extent of overall oxidation undergone by each of these compounds increased significantly with increasing NaOH concentration. All of the compounds that underwent appreciable WO under the reaction conditions studied contained hydrogen(s) significantly more acidic then the compounds that did not undergo appreciable WO, thus indicating that only organic compounds that contain acidic (albeit weakly acidic) hydrogens undergo low temperature (165 &deg;C) WO in highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution. Two different reaction mechanisms were identified to occur during low temperature WO in highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution. Malonic and formic acids underwent WO predominantly via a free radical based reaction mechanism, while citric, lactic, malic and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acids</b> underwent WO predominantly via an ionic based reaction mechanism. The six organic compounds that did not undergo appreciable WO in isolation (acetic, propionic, butyric, oxalic, succinic and glutaric acids) all underwent appreciable WO when in the presence of malonic acid undergoing low temperature WO. Hence, low temperature WO of all of the above-mentioned compounds can be initiated by free radical intermediates produced by malonic acid undergoing WO in highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution. The ability of several transition metal oxides to catalyse the WO of the chosen 12 organic compounds was investigated. Of the transition metal oxides studied CuO was clearly the most active. Five of the organic compounds studied (malonic, citric, lactic, malic and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acids)</b> were catalytically wet oxidised by CuO in highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution in isolation. The order of catalytic activity observed was malonic &gt; tartaric&gt; lactic&gt; malic&gt; citric. Two different catalytic reaction mechanisms were identified for CuO catalysed WO in highly alkaline solution for the organic compounds studied. CuO catalysed the WO of malonic acid predominantly by catalysing the formation of free radical intermediates. CuO catalysed the WO of citric, lactic, malic and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acids</b> predominantly via a complexation-based reaction mechanism...|$|R
