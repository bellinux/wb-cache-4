5|$|Brill Brick and Tile Works {{could not}} compete with the larger and better-connected brickworks at Calvert and declined. The brickworks finally closed in the early 20th century. The {{building}} {{was taken over by}} the W.E. Fenemore workshop, making hay loaders, before being converted into a <b>timber</b> <b>yard</b> in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Glastonbury and Street {{railway station}} {{was the biggest}} station on the {{original}} Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway main line from Highbridge to Evercreech Junction until closed in 1966 under the Beeching axe. Opened in 1854 as Glastonbury, and renamed in 1886, it had three platforms, two for Evercreech to Highbridge services {{and one for the}} branch service to Wells.

5000|$|Generally, <b>timber</b> <b>yards</b> are {{locations}} where raw logs and other wood or forest products are processed and stored. The terms [...] "lumber yard" [...] and [...] "timber yard" [...] are sometimes used interchangeably, and <b>timber</b> <b>yards</b> may include additional aspects that lumber yards encompass, and vice versa.|$|R

5|$|In 1885 the Duke of Buckingham {{opened a}} modern brickworks near Brill station, with a {{dedicated}} siding, and in 1895 his heir William Temple-Gore-Langton, 4th Earl Temple of Stowe, expanded the brickworks, {{which became the}} Brill Brick & Tile Works, using the Brill Tramway to deliver bricks to the main line at Quainton Road. With the connection to Oxford and the upgrading of the rail line abandoned, Brill Brick & Tile Works was unable {{to compete with the}} nearby brickworks at Calvert, and soon closed. The building was taken over by the Fenemore workshop, making hay loaders, before being converted into a <b>timber</b> <b>yard</b> in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|The {{terminus}} of the Rother Navigation {{was on a}} side stream, at {{the southern}} edge of Midhurst. There was a wharf and basin, close to a road which is still called The Wharf, and an ashlar bridge crosses the navigation between the wharf and the junction with the main river. It was built in 1794, and was restored in 1977 to commemorate the silver jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The first lock was near Little Topham farm. There was a lock cut across a loop to the north. Costers Brook, which flows north from springs near Cocking, and then alongside the river for a short distance, joins below the site of the lock. The bridge at South Ambersham was built of stone rubble in 1791, with a main arch across the navigation and a smaller arch to the north, which has been repaired with brick. Moorland Lock was on a straight cut across a large meander to the south, close to Moorlands Farm. Lodsbridge Lock also bypasses a meander to the south, which fed Lodsbridge Mill. The mill building dates from the eighteenth century, and has been converted into a house. The seventeenth-century timber-framed mill house is also a listed building. There was a motte castle immediately to the south of the mill. A modern <b>timber</b> <b>yard</b> and saw mill is located {{to the north of the}} lock site, and Lods Bridge, which carries a minor road over the river, dates from the construction of the navigation. The River Lod joins on the north bank just below the bridge.|$|E

50|$|At <b>timber</b> <b>yards</b> (also {{sometimes}} referred to as lumber yards), logs and other forest products are processed and stored. Additional activities include inspection for signs of rot, utilizing stacking techniques to prevent rot from forming, and the removal of bark and spraying of pesticides to prevent insect infestation. The book The Sustainable City VII: Urban Regeneration and Sustainability proposes that forestry roads can be designed to connect directly with <b>timber</b> <b>yards,</b> to better facilitate the logistics of forest products. Some lumber/timber yards use cranes to move logs, and sprinklers to keep the logs moist.|$|R
50|$|Also {{located near}} the slab hut is a stables, which is timber-framed and clad with {{corrugated}} iron, with large double timber doors located along one elevation. Attached to the stables is a timber-framed shed and set of <b>timber</b> <b>yards.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1885 a fire {{which started}} in a <b>timber</b> <b>yard</b> in Grenfell Street and East Terrace spread to Burford's factory, which was destroyed. This led to the {{establishment}} of a factory in Sturt Street.|$|E

25|$|While the {{specific}} {{plant and equipment}} utilized by Lawrence & Foulks is not known, wooden shipbuilding firms in this era could be established for a remarkably small outlayas little as $11,000, and rarely more than $20,000. Tradesmen at this time mostly supplied their own tools, so a shipyard needed {{little more than a}} waterfront property large enough to hold a <b>timber</b> <b>yard</b> and a slipway or two, a derrick to lift heavy components, a large crosscut saw and a few other tools.|$|E

25|$|The federal {{division}} of the Federated Saw Mill, <b>Timber</b> <b>Yard</b> and General Wood Workers Employees' Association {{changed its name to}} the Amalgamated Timber Workers' Union of Australia. The former union had been registered federally in 1907 and had registered branches in Victoria, Adelaide, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania. Although the organization was deregistered in 1918 its members formed a new union, the Australian Timber Workers' Union, the same year. The new union extended coverage to workers in box and case factories, saw makers' shops, joiners' workshops, carpenters, implement workers and wood-working machinists. In 1940 the union filed an application and succeeded in extending its coverage to most workers employed in the timber and wood industry including cabinet makers and furniture factories. In 1991 it amalgamated with the Pulp & Paper Workers' Federation of Australia to form the Australian Timber & Allied Industries Union. Later in the year amalgamation with the Building Workers' Industrial Union of Australia created the ATAIU & BWIU Amalgamated Union. Further amalgamations eventually saw this organization become part of the Construction Forestry Mining & Energy Union in 1993.|$|E

40|$|Aim of study: This {{study is}} focused on {{detailed}} analysis of accidents in yarding during the years 2006 – 2014. There is still not enough information about such accidents in Central Europe in the literature available. Area of study: We collected the data on occupational accidents recorded in <b>timber</b> <b>yarding</b> from the databases of the Slovak state forest enterprise. Material and Methods: The data on occupational accidents were recorded according to actual European Regulation, {{the form of the}} record meets the requirements of the ESAW (European Statistics on Accidents at Work) methodology. To analyze the data, we used the multiple regression and correlation analysis, contingency tables, and a χ 2 –test. Main results: Almost half of the accidents were the foot injuries and the most frequent type of injury was fracture of a bone. The most hazardous operation was yarding. Most of the accidents occurred between 1301 - 1400 h (22 %). The most frequent agent causing accidents were Particles, dust, splinters, fragments, etc. (14. 05 by ESAW). Research highlights: This study informs about the most important risk factors in <b>timber</b> <b>yarding,</b> the most hazardous parts of shift, as well as the days when the most accidents occur during the week, and as such contributes to better understanding of how the accidents happen in <b>timber</b> <b>yarding.</b> The information can be subsequently used in knowledge-based improvement of safety trainings in forest enterprises...|$|R

500|$|During the 19th century, {{vegetation}} {{continued to}} grow over the castle's stonework, although after a survey by Arthur Blomfield in 1883, which highlighted the damage being caused by the ivy, {{attempts were made to}} control the plants, cleaning them off many of the walls. Ludlow Castle was held in high esteem by Victorian antiquarians, George Clark referring to it as [...] "the glory of the middle marches of Wales" [...] and as being [...] "probably without rival in Britain" [...] for its woodland setting. When Ludlow became connected to the growing railway network in 1852, the numbers of tourists to the castle increased, with admission costing six pence in 1887. The castle was put {{to a wide range of}} uses. The grassy areas of the bailey were kept cropped by grazing sheep and goats, and used for fox hunting meetings, sporting events and agricultural shows; parts of the outer bailey was used as a <b>timber</b> <b>yard,</b> and, by the turn of the century, the old prison was used as an ammunition store by the local volunteer militia.|$|E
500|$|Calcraft was [...] "in great demand" [...] as an executioner {{elsewhere}} in the country as well, such as at Reading Gaol. During his tenure of office the Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868 was passed, requiring that all executions must be conducted in private. Calcraft carried out the last public execution in Britain on 26 May 1868, when he hanged the Fenian Michael Barrett in front of Newgate Prison for his part in the Clerkenwell Outrage. Calcraft also carried out the first private execution in Britain under the new law. Eighteen-year-old Thomas Wells, who had been convicted of the murder of his superior Edward Walshe, the stationmaster at Dover Priory railway station, was hanged on 13 August 1868 in a former <b>timber</b> <b>yard</b> inside Maidstone Gaol. Members of the press were allowed to attend and reported that Wells, who wore his railway porter's uniform, did not die quickly, [...] "struggling {{on the end of the}} rope for several minutes". Calcraft's final official duty was the hanging of James Godwin, on 25 May 1874.|$|E
