25|$|The strong anthropic {{principle}} (SAP) as explained by John D. Barrow and Frank Tipler states <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> {{the case because}} the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life emerge within it. Some critics of the SAP argue {{in favor of a}} weak {{anthropic principle}} (WAP) similar to the one defined by Brandon Carter, which states that the universe's ostensible fine tuning is the result of selection bias (specifically survivor bias): i.e., only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of observing and reflecting upon fine tuning. Most often such arguments draw upon some notion of the multiverse for there to be a statistical population of universes to select from and from which selection bias (our observance of only this universe, compatible with our life) could occur.|$|E
500|$|The next day, SpongeBob {{begins to}} notice that {{everyone}} in town is behaving like jerks. SpongeBob meets Sandy at her treedome, {{and she was a}} jerk, too. SpongeBob accidentally drops a piece of fruitcake in Sandy's Christmas Magic Analyzer, which shows that it is filled with Jerktonium. He and Sandy discover the antidote for Jerktonium to cure the residents in Bikini Bottom is a song called [...] "Don't Be a Jerk (It's Christmas!)." [...] SpongeBob sings it, bringing back the residents' Christmas spirit. Unfortunately, it was too late when Santa arrives and states that everyone is on his naughty list, except for Plankton, who is the only nice person there is, which has earned him the Krabby Patty formula, much to Mr. Krabs shock. SpongeBob tries to convince Santa <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> a mistake, but Santa refuses to believe him, saying he's the worst of all, being blamed for his robot doppelganger's deeds. The wind-up robot shows up to eliminate Santa, but SpongeBob fights the robot with the fruitcake dispenser and finally destroys it, clearing his name. Santa thanks SpongeBob for saving him, which shows that SpongeBob is good, but then he finds the robot's wind-up key by reading [...] "If found, please return to the Chum Bucket," [...] revealing that Plankton was behind all the chaos, and punishes Plankton by giving him, once again, a stocking of coal. Santa lets the residents of Bikini Bottom celebrate the holiday, and he leaves Bikini Bottom, only for Patrick Star to capture him in a jellyfish/butterfly net and throw him off-course.|$|E

He claims that the Panamanian students stumbled and accidentally tore their own flag. David M. White, an apprentice telephone technician with the Panama Canal Company, stated that [...] "the police gripped the students, who were four or five abreast, under the shoulders in the armpits and edged them forward. One of the students fell or tripped and I believe when he went down the old flag was torn." [...] However we must take into account <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> hearsay.|$|E

But failure cases of ERP implementation showed, that organizations have to do extensive work on implementation. Because of that, organizations have to create conditions, {{in which they can}} implement chosen solution in expected time, scope and evaluated costs. That means that organizations should be aware of what most critical factors for success (CSF) in ERP implementations are. The high failure rate of ERP implementations call for better understanding of critical success factors (CSFs). In the paper we will research the CSFs in ERP implementation by studying published prior research on the field of ERP implementation. We will build a model of CSFs for ERP implementation, discuss in depth some most important factors and present preliminary results of importance CSFs of ERP implementation in Slovenian organizations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeveral {{models have}} {{proposed}} that language control occurs between language representations, such as language tags, and between lemmas. Yet, most research has solely focused on language-control processes between language representations. In the present study, we investigated whether language control can also occur between lemmas by allowing bilinguals to practice a language or language-specific items prior to a language-switching task, and thus change the relative activation of the language representations and/or lemmas. By changing the activation levels, relatively more language control should occur for this language representation and/or lemma relative to their translation-equivalent due to the reactive nature of language control. The results showed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> the more so when language-specific items were practiced than when merely a language was practiced. Hence, the current study provides evidence that language control is not restricted to language representations, but could also occur between lemmas...|$|R
