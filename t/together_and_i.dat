25|$|Under these {{circumstances}} any political bargaining {{might well have}} been disastrous to Home Rule. Redmond desperately wanted and needed a rapid enactment of the Home Rule Act, and undoubtedly his words were a means to that end. He called on the country to support the Allied and British war effort and Britain's commitment under the Triple Entente; this was a calculated response to the situation principally in the belief that the attained measure of self-government would be granted in full after the war and to be in a stronger position to stave off a final partition of Northern Ireland. His added hope was that the common sacrifice by Irish nationalists and Unionists would bring them closer together, but above all that nationalists could not afford to allow Ulster Unionists to reap the benefit of being the only Irish to support the war effort, when they spontaneously enlisted in their 36th (Ulster) Division. He said Let Irishmen come together in the trenches and risk their lives together and spill their blood <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> say there is no power on earth that when they come home can induce them to turn as enemies upon one another.|$|E

In June 2005, Whibley {{proposed}} to her. The couple married on 15 July 2006 in Montecito, California. On 9 October 2009, Lavigne filed for divorce, releasing the statement, [...] "I am grateful for our time <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship."

500|$|In {{an early}} {{recollection}} of the character's creation, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan #2 (Summer 1965): [...] "Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist & spider signal." [...] At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was [...] "almost nil", he and Ditko had [...] "worked on storyboards <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> added a few ideas. But {{the whole thing was}} created by Steve on his own... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands." ...|$|E
500|$|In casting his nine-member crew, Whedon looked {{first at}} the actors and {{considered}} their chemistry with others. Cast member Sean Maher recalls, [...] "So then he just sort of put us all <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{think it was very}} quick, like right out of the gate, we all instantly bonded". All nine cast members were chosen before filming began. However, while filming the original pilot [...] "Serenity", Whedon decided that Rebecca Gayheart was unsuitable for the role of Inara Serra, and shot her scenes in singles so that {{it would be easier to}} replace her. Morena Baccarin auditioned for the role and two days later was on the set in her first television show. [...] "Joss brought me down from the testing room like a proud dad, holding my hand and introducing me," [...] Baccarin recalled.|$|E
500|$|Pickens {{prepared}} for this role by observing several of Kersh's real-life counterparts at the FBI's Los Angeles office, where, according to the actor, the most useful thing he learned was {{that most of the}} people at Kersh's level had been with the Bureau for twenty or twenty-five years and had not reached their positions in the FBI hierarchy by taking their work less than seriously or bucking the system without good reason. Robert Patrick, who portrayed John Doggett, recognized that his own character and Kersh were [...] "both military men – Air Force, Marines". Kersh was depicted as a United States Navy A-6 Intruder weapons officer during the Vietnam War. Both Patrick and director Kim Manners thought that, as Kersh, Pickens would [...] "come in each week and just nail his stuff" [...] regardless of what else was going on. Similarly, Frank Spotnitz thought that [...] "Robert Patrick and James Pickens really had a chemistry, loved playing scenes <b>together.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> think their scenes together were some of the finest ones in the last two years of the show." ...|$|E

500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E
500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way to find your way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E

In the aftermath of his dismissal, Sheen remained vocally critical of Chuck Lorre, and filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against Lorre and Warner Bros., which was settled the following September 26. That same month, Sheen, while presenting an award at the Primetime Emmy Awards, addressed [...] "everybody here from Two and a Half Men" [...] and stated, [...] "From {{the bottom of my}} heart, I wish you nothing but the best for this upcoming season.

2500|$|The No. 88, {{according}} to NASCAR archives, {{was driven by}} Ralph Earnhardt, his paternal grandfather, in 1957.

Hendrick said about Earnhardt and his uncles, [...] "I can look at Robert Gee Jr., or Jimmy Gee, or Dale Jr., and all I see is Robert Gee. They're the spitting image of him. I go back and look and pictures from when we did things <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have to say, I owe Robert a lot."

Writers have variously attributed Bacharach influence on Wilson's [...] "Guess I'm Dumb", [...] "Let Him Run Wild, and [...] "The Little Girl I Once Knew". Discussing [...] "Let's Go Away", Wilson said: [...] "there {{were a lot of}} chord changes similar to the way he would put something <b>together.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> think that his music had such a profound thing on my head; he got me going in a direction."

2500|$|Marvel {{editor-in-chief}} Roy Thomas asked writer Len Wein {{to devise}} a character specifically named Wolverine, who is Canadian and of small stature and with a wolverine's fierce temper. John Romita, Sr. designed the first Wolverine costume, and believes he introduced the retractable claws, saying, [...] "When I make a design, I {{want it to be}} practical and functional. I thought, 'If a man has claws like that, how does he scratch his nose or tie his shoelaces?'" [...] Wolverine first appeared in the final [...] "teaser" [...] panel of The Incredible Hulk #180 (cover-dated Oct. 1974) written by Wein and penciled by Herb Trimpe. The character then appeared in a number of advertisements in various Marvel Comics publications before making his first major appearance in The Incredible Hulk #181 (Nov. 1974) again by the Wein–Trimpe team. In 2009, Trimpe said he [...] "distinctly remembers" [...] Romita's sketch and that, [...] "The way I see it, [...] sewed the monster <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shocked it to life!... It {{was just one of those}} secondary or tertiary characters, actually, that we were using in that particular book with no particular notion of it going anywhere.

2500|$|Following the breakup, Christensen {{became more}} {{introverted}} than usual, {{and his girlfriend}} could not handle him being in this crisis. He went through a difficult time of coping with both his breakup with the band and with Rosendahl, but {{he went on to}} find his musical style, which resulted in the release of his debut solo album Secrets on Parade in 2000, of which some songs were based on the Dizzy Mizz Lizzy demos from 1998. Several songs on the album were rather ambiguous as to whether they referred to Dizzy Mizz Lizzy or Rosendahl. The album was a success, and it allowed him to further pursue a career in music. Nielsen and Friis initially also intended to continue in music, but turned to a normal working-class life. To walk off the extra weight he had gained from being at home for a long time, Nielsen {{took a job as a}} postman, while Friis became a truck driver delivering gas containers. Despite their different paths, Christensen explained in a 2000 interview that the trio remained friends: [...] "We meet occasionally and have great fun together. Of course we talk about the old days and amuse ourselves with it, because we experienced a lot of great things <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> simply can not remember anything bad from back then. (...) But we just developed ourselves in three different directions, and we kept growing further apart, so it was simply the time to stop." ...|$|E
