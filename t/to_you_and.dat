5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

25|$|Metheny {{then again}} delved into adventurous solo and band projects, {{and four years}} went by before {{the release of the}} next record for the next Pat Metheny Group. This was a live set {{recorded}} in Europe entitled The Road <b>to</b> <b>You,</b> <b>and</b> it featured tracks from the two Geffen studio albums alongside new tunes. By this stage, the group had integrated new instrumentation and technologies into its sound, including Mays' addition of midi-controlled synthesized sounds to acoustic piano solos, accomplished via a pedal control.|$|E
25|$|I {{might put}} it this way. The story is cast {{in terms of a}} good side, and a bad side, beauty against {{ruthless}} ugliness, tyranny against kingship, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save mere power, and so on; but both sides in some degree, conservative or destructive, want a measure of control. But if you have, as it were, taken 'a vow of poverty', renounced control, and take your delight in things for themselves without reference to yourself, watching, observing, and to some extent knowing, then the questions of the rights and wrongs of power and control might become utterly meaningless <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> the means of power quite valueless...|$|E

25|$|I {{will say}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> to the colored race {{that men who}} bore arms and {{followed}} {{the flag of the}} Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{variously}} {{described as a}} recreation or re-enactment of this source material, or else as a homage, a pastiche a [...] "loving, but merciless" [...] parody, or spoof of it.

It's more about examining how {{your friends and family}} react to you when you're sick." [...] "We don't want to do some ridiculous she-might-die thing.

5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{philosophers}} to write {{on the theme of}} divine hiddenness was Anselm of Canterbury, who in his Proslogion links it to an existential or spiritual concern: I have never seen thee, O Lord my God; I do not know thy form. What, O most high Lord, shall this man do, an exile far from thee? What shall thy servant do, anxious in his love of <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> cast out afar from thy face? He pants <b>to</b> see <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> thy face is too far from him. He longs <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> thy dwelling place is inaccessible. He is eager <b>to</b> find <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> knows not thy place. He desires <b>to</b> seek <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> does not know thy face. Lord, thou art my God, and thou art my Lord, yet never have I seen thee. It is thou that hast made me, and hast made me anew, and hast bestowed upon me all the blessings I enjoy; and not yet do I know thee. Finally, I was created <b>to</b> see <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> not yet have I done that for which I was made.|$|R
