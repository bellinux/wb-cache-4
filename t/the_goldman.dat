As <b>the</b> <b>Goldman</b> Sachs senior partner, he helped develop a private sector plan to rescue the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management when the leveraged fund's collapse {{in the fall of}} 1998 threatened contagion across the U.S. financial system. According to U.S. News & World Report, Corzine did not get along with co-CEO Henry Paulson, who came from the other major area of the bank, investment banking. When Corzine participated in structuring the bailout, Paulson seized control of the firm. As co-chairman of the firm, he oversaw its expansion into Asia. When Goldman Sachs went public after Corzine's departure, Corzine made $400million.|$|E

Bikeshare Holdings LLC, a new entity formed by the partners at real estate developer Related Companies and gym chain Equinox Fitness, acquired Alta Bicycle Share—renamed Motivate—and named Jay Walder as the new chief executive. The increase of funding includes $5 million from Bikeshare Holdings; $70.5 million from a 10-year extension of the Citigroup sponsorship; and $15 million from <b>the</b> <b>Goldman</b> Sachs Urban Investment Group. As part of the restructuring deal, Walder moved the company headquarters from Portland, Oregon, to New York City. The Citi Bike system {{would continue to be}} operated by NYC Bicycle Share, a subsidiary of Alta Bicycle Share. By 2017, Citi Bike would expand its operations by 6,000 bikes and add 375 new docking stations. This agreement also calls for improvements to the system's operations, including upgrades to its software and technology. The company was also appointing a vice president for technology.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Goldman</b> model {{differs from}} the Kidd-Stubbs series {{decompression}} model in that <b>the</b> <b>Goldman</b> model assumes linear kinetics, where the K-S model includes a quadratic component, and <b>the</b> <b>Goldman</b> model considers only the central well-perfused compartment to contribute explicitly to risk, while the K-S model assumes all compartments to carry potential risk. The DCIEM 1983 model associates risk with the two outermost compartments of a four compartment series. The mathematical model based on this concept is claimed by Goldman to fit not only the Navy square profile data used for calibration, but also predicts risk relatively accurately for saturation profiles. A bubble version of the ICM model was not significantly different in predictions, and was discarded as more complex with no significant advantages. The ICM also predicted decompression sickness incidence more accurately at the low-risk recreational diving exposures recorded in DAN's Project Dive Exploration data set. The alternative models {{used in this study}} were the LE1 (Linear-Exponential) and straight Haldanean models. <b>The</b> <b>Goldman</b> model predicts a significant risk reduction following a safety stop on a low-risk dive and significant risk reduction by using nitrox (more so than the PADI tables suggest).|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Goldman</b> Sachs global {{economics}} team {{released a}} follow-up report to its initial BRIC study in 2004.

This predicts a massive rise {{in the size of the}} middle class in these nations. In 2025, it is calculated that {{the number of people}} in BRIC nations earning over $15,000 may reach over 200 million people. This indicates that a huge pickup in demand will not be restricted to basic goods but impact higher-priced goods as well.

25|$|Early {{decompression}} models {{tended to}} use the dissolved phase models, and adjusted them by more or less arbitrary factors {{to reduce the risk}} of symptomatic bubble formation. Dissolved phase models are of two main groups. Parallel compartment models, where several compartments with varying rates of gas absorption (half time), are considered to exist independently of each other, and the limiting condition is controlled by the compartment which shows the worst case for a specific exposure profile. These compartments represent conceptual tissues and are not intended to represent specific organic tissues, merely to represent the range of possibilities for the organic tissues. The second group uses serial compartments, where gas is assumed to diffuse through one compartment before it reaches the next. A recent variation on the serial compartment model is <b>the</b> <b>Goldman</b> interconnected compartment model (ICM).|$|E
