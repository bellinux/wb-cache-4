25|$|At {{the scale}} of the {{wavelength}} of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner (not diffusely). <b>The</b> <b>glint</b> of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small angles of incident light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Little Round Top was undefended by Union troops. Maj. Gen. George Meade, {{commander}} of the Army of the Potomac, had ordered Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles's III Corps to defend {{the southern end of}} Cemetery Ridge, which would have just included Little Round Top. But Sickles, defying Meade's orders, moved his corps a few hundred yards west to the Emmitsburg Road and the Peach Orchard, causing a large salient in the line, which was also too long to defend properly. His left flank was anchored in Devil's Den. When Meade discovered this situation, he dispatched his chief engineer, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, to attempt to deal with the situation south of Sickles's position. Climbing Little Round Top, Warren found only a small Signal Corps station there. He saw <b>the</b> <b>glint</b> of bayonets in the sun to the southwest and realized that a Confederate assault into the Union flank was imminent. He hurriedly sent staff officers, including Washington Roebling, to find help from any available units in the vicinity.|$|E

2500|$|An antireflective or anti-reflection (AR) coating {{is a type}} {{of optical}} coating applied to the surface of lenses and other optical {{elements}} to reduce reflection. In typical imaging systems, this improves the efficiency since less light is lost. In complex systems such as a telescope, the reduction in reflections also improves the contrast of the image by elimination of stray light. This is especially important in planetary astronomy. In other applications, the primary benefit is the elimination of the reflection itself, such as a coating on eyeglass lenses that makes the eyes of the wearer more visible to others, or a coating to reduce <b>the</b> <b>glint</b> from a covert viewer's binoculars or telescopic sight.|$|E

2500|$|Lucy is {{the common}} name of AL 288-1, several hundred pieces of bone {{representing}} about 40% of the skeleton of an individual Australopithecus afarensis. Lucy is reckoned to have lived 3.2 million years ago. This hominid was significant as the skeleton shows evidence of small skull capacity akin to that of apes and of bipedal upright walk akin to that of humans, providing further evidence that bipedalism preceded increase in brain size in human evolution. While working in collaboration with a joint French-British-American team, Lucy was discovered in Hadar, Ethiopia on November 24, 1974, when American paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, coaxed away from his paperwork by graduate student Tom Gray for a spur-of-the-moment survey, caught <b>the</b> <b>glint</b> of a white fossilized bone {{out of the corner}} of his eye, and recognized it as hominid. Later described as the first known member of Australopithecus afarensis.

5000|$|Long ago, the {{isolated}} planet Maske was settled by a religious group. They seized {{a section of}} the planet from earlier colonists (the Djan), and named it Thaery. The ship carrying a dissident faction was attacked and crashed across the Long Ocean which encircles the planet. The survivors eventually reemerged as the Waels of Wellas. The members of another faction were exiled to the stony peninsula of Glentlin, where they became <b>the</b> <b>Glints.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Glints</b> became notorious bandits, but were eventually subjugated. However, they are still looked down upon as coarse and belligerent. Some Glints took to sailing, and as [...] "Sea Nationals", claimed sovereignty over the ocean. The orthodox settlers divided Thaery into twelve prosperous cantons. Seeking to maintain their religious purity, the Thariots prohibited all travel to other worlds.|$|R

2500|$|Little Round Top, which {{dominated}} the Union position on Cemetery Ridge, was initially unoccupied by Union troops. [...] Union commander Maj. Gen. George Meade's chief engineer, Brig. Gen Gouverneur K. Warren, had climbed the hill on his superior's orders {{to assess the}} situation there; he noticed <b>the</b> <b>glint</b> of Confederate bayonets to the hill's southwest, and realized that a Southern attack was imminent. [...] Warren's frantic cry for reinforcements to occupy the hill was answered by Col. Strong Vincent, commanding the Third Brigade of the First Division of the Union V Corps. [...] Vincent rapidly moved the four regiments of his brigade onto the hill, only ten minutes ahead of the approaching Confederates. [...] Under heavy fire from Southern batteries, Vincent arranged his four regiments atop the hill with the 16th Michigan to the northwest, then proceeding counterclockwise with the 44th New York, the 83rd Pennsylvania, and finally, {{at the end of}} the line on the southern slope, the 20th Maine. [...] With only minutes to spare, Vincent told his regiments to take cover and await the inevitable Confederate assault; he specifically ordered Col. Joshua L. Chamberlain, commanding the 20th Maine (at the extreme end of the Union line), to hold his position to the last man, at all costs. [...] Were Chamberlain's regiment to be forced to retreat, the other regiments on the hill would be compelled to follow suit, and the entire left flank of Meade's army would be in serious jeopardy, possibly leading them to retreat and giving the Confederates their desperately needed victory at Gettysburg.|$|E

40|$|<b>Glint,</b> <b>the</b> {{specular}} reflection of sunlight off Earth's oceans, may reveal {{the presence of}} oceans on an extrasolar planet. As an Earth-like planet nears crescent phases, the size of <b>the</b> ocean <b>glint</b> spot increases relative to the fraction of illuminated disk, while the reflectivity of this spot increases. Both effects change the planet's visible reflectivity {{as a function of}} phase. However, strong forward scattering of radiation by clouds can also produce increases in a planet's reflectivity as it approaches crescent phases, and surface glint can be obscured by Rayleigh scattering and atmospheric absorption. Here we explore <b>the</b> detectability of <b>glint</b> in <b>the</b> presence of an atmosphere and realistic phase-dependent scattering from oceans and clouds. We use the NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory 3 -D line-by-line, multiple-scattering spectral Earth model to simulate Earth's broadband visible brightness and reflectivity over an orbit. Our validated simulations successfully reproduce phase-dependent Earthshine observations. We find that <b>the</b> <b>glinting</b> Earth can be as much as 100 % brighter at crescent phases than simulations that do not include <b>glint,</b> and that <b>the</b> effect is dependent on both orbital inclination and wavelength, where the latter dependence is caused by Rayleigh scattering limiting sensitivity to the surface. We show that this phenomenon may be observable using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) paired with an external occulter.
