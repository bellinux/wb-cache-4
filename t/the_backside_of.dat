5|$|Saomai {{continued}} {{moving toward}} the northwest and passed over the Mariana Islands on August 6 while continuing to strengthen, and was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA later that day. The storm then began organizing and intensifying more rapidly, becoming a typhoon early on August 7. Saomai moved into the area of responsibility of PAGASA on August 8, and was designated Typhoon Juan. Due to Saomai's proximity to Tropical Storm Bopha, located near Taiwan, the two underwent a Fujiwhara interaction.

5|$|The Jets snapped their {{losing streak}} in a 27–13 {{victory over the}} St. Louis Rams in which Sanchez {{completed}} 15 of his 20 passes for 178 {{yards and a touchdown}}. However, his struggles continued in a rematch against New England on Thanksgiving night. Despite completing 26 of 36 of his pass attempts for 301 yards and a touchdown and interception, the Jets lost to the Patriots 49–19 and fell to 4–7 as Sanchez turned the ball over twice—each turnover led to Patriots touchdowns. The Jets surrendered 21 points within a 53-second span on 3 turnovers. The play that earned Sanchez the most criticism was a second-quarter fumble where he ran into <b>the</b> <b>backside</b> <b>of</b> lineman Brandon Moore and the Patriots scored on the resulting fumble; this play, becoming widely known as the butt fumble, was mocked in the media.|$|E
5|$|On Falalop Island, the seawall erected during World War II {{was entirely}} {{destroyed}} and allowed storm surge to inundate the island; however, {{at no point}} was the entire island under water. Initially, Falalop was left under 1.2m (4ft) of water, though {{by the time the}} eye moved over this had decreased to 0.6m (2ft). Along the south shore, waves reached 1.8m (6ft) and caused moderate beach erosion. Sand from the coastline was found up to 215m (700ft) inland, filling many taro pits in the island's interior. Along the south shore, two children were killed when their home collapsed, pinning them underneath debris, and water later inundated the area and drowned them. Elsewhere on the island, three people sustained minor injuries. Asor Island experienced most of its flooding as <b>the</b> <b>backside</b> <b>of</b> Ophelia moved through. The island was shortened by 45m (150ft) to the north and southern beaches experienced varying degrees of erosion. Mogmog Island, located at the northern end of the atoll's lagoon, saw the deposition of large boulders and cobblestone along its north shore which covered an area 30 to 45m (100 to 150ft) wide. Flying debris resulted in one injury on both Asor and Mogmog. To the west, Potangeras Island saw an increase in land area by 60m (200ft) as sand was pushed from other areas.|$|E

5|$|One more legend narrated {{is about}} the goddess painted on a thangka in the monastery which is of Palden Lhamo. This female deity is {{compared}} to the Hindu Goddess Kali. Like Kali, Palden Lhamo's thangka is drawn in black colour, with flaming eyes, dressed in skirt made of tiger skin, and a garland of skulls around her neck. A moon disc adorns her hair, {{similar to the one}} seen on Shiva. She is also associated with Goddess Saraswati and Ma Tara. Legend also states that in the past she had lived in Sri Lanka as the consort of a demon king who practiced human sacrifice. As she was not supportive of this practice she fled from the kingdom. As she was running away, the king shot her shot with an arrow, which struck <b>the</b> <b>backside</b> <b>of</b> the mule that she was riding. When she drew out the arrow, it left a gaping hole in the mule's back, and through this gap Palden Lhamo could watch the teachings of Lord Buddha.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the rear}} {{part of the}} skull is preserved. It likely showed a horselike, broad snout {{equipped}} with pencil-like teeth, as seen in related sauropods for which more complete skulls are known. As in other dicraeosaurids, the external naris (nostril opening) was situated in the posterior half of the skull, diagonally above the eye socket, which was proportionally large. As in most other dinosaurs, the skull featured three additional openings (fenestrae). The infratemporal fenestra, located below the eye socket, was long and narrow. Behind the eye socket was the supratemporal fenestra, which in dicraeosaurids was uniquely small and can be seen when the skull is viewed from the side. This contrasts with other diapsid reptiles, where these openings were directed upwards, thus being visible only in top view. The antorbital fenestra would have been located {{in front of the}} eye socket, although this region is not preserved. An unusual feature were small openings seen on <b>the</b> <b>backside</b> <b>of</b> the skull, the so-called parietal openings or fontanelles. In other tetrapods, these openings are usually seen only in juveniles and would close as the individual grows. Skull features shared with Dicraeosaurus but absent in other sauropods included the fused frontal bones and the notably long basipterygoid processes, bony extensions connecting the braincase with the palate.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of temperature and roughness on <b>the</b> <b>backside</b> emissivity <b>of</b> Si wafers was studied.

At temperatures above 600 - 700 -degrees-C the wafers are opaque and the emissivity is only slightly dependent on backside roughness. At lower temperatures the wafers are partially transparent and the emissivity is strongly dependent on <b>the</b> <b>backside</b> roughness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wafer due to light trapping in the bulk of the wafer. For the latter case a new model was developed to simulate the emissivity of wafers with a rough backside at low temperatures. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Service on Flowers in the North Atlantic was {{typically}} cold, wet, monotonous and uncomfortable.

25|$|Viewed {{from the}} {{entrance}} gate, which is facing west, it is in curved shape, and appears like <b>the</b> <b>backside</b> <b>of</b> an elephant and hence the style is termed gajapristha (back of an elephant). To add to this epithet, a large sized elephant sculpture, a monolithic sculpture, is carved next to the ratha. The ratha is classified under the vasara style. This monolithic structure, {{along with the other}} Pancha Rathas, opposite to the Arjuna Ratha, was built out of a single rock outcrop of granite. It is an apsidal (horseshoe-shaped) dvitala (two tiered) free standing structure, entirely of Dravidian architecture. It is built on the same base, {{at the end of the}} three rathas of Dharmaraja, Bhima and Arjuna, but facing south. There are no idols to worship inside the ratha. The walls of this ratha also have features arranged in a sequence to delineate the “projections and recesses created by pairs of shallow pilasters.” The niches on the interior walls of the ratha have carved images of gods and demi-gods. The roof (in the form of the back of an elephant) terminates as a pyramid or finial or shikara, which is carved with motifs. The unusual architecture of this ratha is said to be an innovation of the architect.|$|E
25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on <b>the</b> <b>backside</b> <b>of</b> the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E
