5|$|Meibomian glands, in the eyelids, secrete {{a form of}} sebum called meibum {{onto the}} eye, that slows the {{evaporation}} of tears. It also serves to create an airtight seal when the eyes are closed and its lipid quality also prevents the eyelids from sticking together. The meibomian glands are also known as <b>tarsal</b> glands, Zeis glands and palpebral glands. They attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes, which are arranged vertically within the <b>tarsal</b> plates of the eyelids.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{hypothesised}} {{description of}} what Mesozoic ants looked like was somewhat accurate when compared to actual specimens, some characteristics were inaccurate. They believed that ant-like mandibles first appeared before {{the development of an}} ant-like petiole, but such case was proven false when it was opposite on S. freyi specimens (ant-like petiole first appeared before the development of ant-like mandibles). Based on drawings, it was suggested that Mesozoic ants had long mandibles with multiple teeth, toothed <b>tarsal</b> claws and a broadly jointed petiole. Examination of collected specimens, however, shows that these ants had very short mandibles, toothless <b>tarsal</b> claws and a separated petiole.|$|E
5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for heel pain is extensive and includes pathological entities including, {{but not limited}} to the following: calcaneal stress fracture, calcaneal bursitis, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis involving the nerve roots of lumbar spinal nerve 5 (L5) or sacral spinal nerve 1 (S1), calcaneal fat pad syndrome, hypothyroidism, seronegative spondyloparthopathies such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or rheumatoid arthritis (more likely if pain is present in both heels), plantar fascia rupture, and compression neuropathies such as <b>tarsal</b> tunnel syndrome or impingement of the medial calcaneal nerve.|$|E
50|$|Estimated at under 1 kg in weight, Albinykus {{was one of}} the {{smallest}} alvarezsaurs and among {{the smallest}} nonavian dinosaurs. The body size of alvarezsaurs decreased throughout their evolutionary history, and Albinykus represents a particularly derived form. One distinguishing feature of Albinykus not seen in other alvarezsaurids is the complete fusion of the <b>tarsals</b> to other bones of the leg; the proximal <b>tarsals</b> are fused to the tibia bone of the lower leg and the distal <b>tarsals</b> are fused to the metatarsal bones of the foot.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} sauropod limbs is their reduced ossification - {{the tendency to}} replace bone by cartilage. Gongxianosaurus is the only known sauropod with ossified distal <b>tarsals.</b> Thus, either Gongxianosaurus {{was one of the}} basalmost sauropods, or ossified distal <b>tarsals</b> were present in other early sauropods but are simply not preserved due to the fragmentation of the specimens.|$|R

5|$|The spiders {{are unique}} in the {{flexible}} and teethed hook-like claws on the last segments (tarsus) of their legs. These elongated claws resemble those of spiders in the family Gradungulidae of Australia and New Zealand, but the two families are only distantly related. Hooked <b>tarsal</b> claws are also present {{to a lesser extent}} in the unrelated genera Doryonychus of Tetragnathidae, Hetrogriffus of Thomisidae and Celaenia of Araneidae.|$|E
5|$|The multisegmented legs end {{in two to}} five small {{segments}} called tarsi. Like {{many other}} insect orders, beetles have claws, usually one pair, {{on the end of}} the last <b>tarsal</b> segment of each leg. While most beetles use their legs for walking, legs have been variously adapted for other uses. Aquatic beetles including the Dytiscidae (diving beetles), Haliplidae, and many species of Hydrophilidae, the legs, often the last pair, are modified for swimming, typically with rows of long hairs. Male diving beetles have suctorial cups on their forelegs that they use to grasp females. Other beetles have fossorial legs widened and often spined for digging. Species with such adaptations are found among the scarabs, ground beetles, and clown beetles (Histeridae). The hind legs of some beetles, such as flea beetles (within Chrysomelidae) and flea weevils (within Curculionidae), have enlarged femurs that help them leap.|$|E
5|$|Beetles are {{generally}} {{characterized by a}} particularly hard exoskeleton and hard forewings (elytra) not usable for flying. Almost all beetles have mandibulate mouthparts with the mandibles mobile in a horizontal plane. The mouthparts are rarely suctorial and are sometimes reduced and the maxillae always bear palps. The antennae usually have 11 or fewer segments except in some groups like the Rhipiceridae and Cerambycidae. The coxae of the legs are usually located recessed within a coxal cavity. The genitalic structures are telescoped into the last abdominal segment in all extant beetles. Unlike the adults, beetle larvae can often be confused with larvae of other endopterygote groups. The beetle's exoskeleton {{is made up of}} numerous plates, called sclerites, separated by thin sutures. This design provides armored defenses while maintaining flexibility. The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform, although specific organs and appendages vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order. Like all insects, beetles' bodies are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. Because there are so many species, identification is quite difficult, and relies on attributes including the shape of the antennae, the <b>tarsal</b> formulae and shapes of these small segments on the legs, the mouthparts, and the ventral plates (sterna, pleura, coxae). In many species accurate identification can only be made by examination of the unique male genitalic structures.|$|E

50|$|Artiocetus is an extinct genus {{of early}} whales {{belonging}} to the family Protocetidae. It was a close relative to Rodhocetus and its <b>tarsals</b> indicate it resembled an artiodactyl.|$|R
50|$|In {{primitive}} tetrapods, such as Trematops, the tarsus {{consists of}} three rows of bones. There are three proximal <b>tarsals,</b> the tibiale, intermedium, and fibulare, named for their points of articulation with {{the bones of the}} lower limb. These are followed by a second row of four bones, referred to as the centralia (singular: centrale), and then a row of five distal <b>tarsals,</b> each articulating with a single metatarsal. In the great majority of tetrapods, including all of those alive today, this simple pattern is modified by the loss and fusion of some of the bones.|$|R
5|$|Caddisfly larvae are aquatic, {{with six}} pairs of {{tracheal}} gills {{on the underside}} of the abdomen. The eggs are laid above water on emergent twigs or vegetation or on the water surface although females of some species enter water to choose sites. Although most species lay eggs, a few in the genus Triplectides are ovoviviparous. Some species lay eggs on land and although most are associated with freshwater, a few like Symphitoneuria are found in coastal saline water. Philanisus plebeius females lay their eggs into the coelomic cavity of intertidal starfish. The larvae are long and roughly cylindrical, very similar to those of lepidoptera but lacking prolegs. In case-bearing species, the heads are heavily sclerotinised while the abdomen is soft; the antennae are short and the mouthparts adapted for biting. Each of the usually ten abdominal segments bears a pair of legs with a single <b>tarsal</b> joint. In case-bearing species, the first segment bears three papillae, one above and two at the sides, which anchor the larva centrally in the tube. The posterior segment bears a pair of hooks for grappling. There are five to seven larval instars, followed by an aquatic pupa which has functional mandibles (to cut through the case), gills, and swimming legs.|$|E
5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, <b>tarsal</b> (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The postcranial {{anatomy of}} Heterodontosaurus tucki has been well-described, {{although}} H. tucki {{is generally considered}} the most derived of the Early Jurassic heterodontosaurids, so {{it is impossible to}} know how many of its features were shared with other species. The forelimbs were long for a dinosaur, over 70% of the length of the hindlimbs. The well-developed deltopectoral crest (a ridge for the attachment of chest and shoulder muscles) of the humerus and prominent olecranon process (where muscles that extend the forearm were attached) of the ulna indicate that the forelimb was powerful as well. There were five digits on the manus ('hand'). The first was large, tipped with a sharply curved claw, and would rotate inwards when flexed; Robert Bakker called it the 'twist-thumb'. The second digit was the longest, slightly longer than the third. Both of these digits bore claws, while the clawless fourth and fifth digits were very small and simple in comparison. In the hindlimb, the tibia was 30% longer than the femur, which is generally considered an adaptation for speed. The tibia and fibula of the lower leg were fused to the astragalus and calcaneum of the ankle, forming a 'tibiofibiotarsus' convergently with modern birds. Also similarly to birds, the lower <b>tarsal</b> (ankle) bones and metatarsals were fused to form a 'tarsometatarsus.' There are four digits in the pes (hindfoot), with only the second, third, and fourth contacting the ground. The tail, unlike many other ornithischians, did not have ossified tendons to maintain a rigid posture and was probably flexible. The fragmentary skeleton known for Abrictosaurus has never been fully described, although the forelimb and manus were smaller than in Heterodontosaurus. Also, the fourth and fifth digits of the forelimb each bear one fewer phalanx bone.|$|E
50|$|In birds, the tarsus has disappeared, {{with the}} {{proximal}} <b>tarsals</b> having fused with the tibia, the centralia having disappeared, and the distal bones having fused with the metatarsals {{to form a}} single tarsometatarsus bone, effectively giving the leg a third segment.|$|R
5000|$|Pantodonts have plesiomorphic (unaltered) {{and robust}} postcranial skeletons. Their five-toed feet are often hoofed with the <b>tarsals</b> {{similar to those}} of ungulates, which feature had led to {{previously}} suggested ties to arctocyonid [...] "condylarths", but this similarity is now considered primitive.|$|R
50|$|Similarly to extant reptiles, C. aguti has a {{functional}} “mesotarsal” joint. It divides the tarsus into a proximal and distal unit, where the centrale is linked mechanically to the proximal (astragalus-calcaneum) unit. The increased flexibility {{due to this}} multiple-jointed arrangement allowed for the articulations between the centrale and first three distal <b>tarsals</b> on the medial side of the mesotarsal joint to have mechanical independence from the lateral articulation between the astragalus-calcaneum and {{the fourth and fifth}} distal <b>tarsals.</b> This is almost certainly closely correlated with the primitive sprawling step cycle. Due to the shape of the distal femoral articulation, Captorhinus aguti would have had little capacity to compensate for lateral movement of the femur.|$|R
25|$|Forficula auricularia has an {{elongated}} flattened brownish colored body, with a shield-shaped pronotum, {{two pairs of}} wings {{and a pair of}} forcep-like cerci. They are about 12–15mm long. The second <b>tarsal</b> segment is lobed, extending distally below the third <b>tarsal</b> segment. The antenna consists of 11–14 segments, and the mouth parts are of the chewing type.|$|E
25|$|The Pieridae {{have the}} radial vein on the forewing {{with three or}} four {{branches}} and rarely with five branches. The forelegs are well developed in both sexes, unlike in the Nymphalidae, and the <b>tarsal</b> claws are , unlike in the Papilionidae.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{compression}} can cause, over time, the cartilage {{between the}} upper and lower surfaces of the lower <b>tarsal</b> bones to become compressed and eroded. The joint spaces then become smaller, and new bone growth may occur in the area.|$|E
50|$|Hylomys megalotis {{is a type}} of gymnure. Compared {{to other}} Hylomys species, H. megalotis has rounder, more prominent, and larger ears. Its soles and <b>tarsals</b> are naked, and it has long and {{moderately}} stout claws. The skull of H. megalotis is elongated, flattened, and moderately slender.|$|R
25|$|A {{short bone}} {{is one that}} is cube-like in shape, being {{approximately}} equal in length, width, and thickness. The only short bones in the human skeleton are in the carpals of the wrists and the <b>tarsals</b> of the ankles. Short bones provide stability and support as well as some limited motion.|$|R
50|$|Vallesaurus {{is a small}} drepanosaurid about 15 cm long. It is pentadactyl, {{with the}} 4th digit being longest and equal in length to the humerus. Its tarsus has a centrale, or an ankle bone which articulates with the tibia. In addition, Vallesaurus also has {{modified}} distal <b>tarsals</b> and metatarsals, and a clawless hallux.|$|R
25|$|Viral {{conjunctivitis}} shows a fine, diffuse pinkness of the conjunctiva, {{which is}} easily mistaken for the ciliary infection of iris (iritis), {{but there are}} usually corroborative signs on microscopy, particularly numerous lymphoid follicles on the <b>tarsal</b> conjunctiva, and sometimes a punctate keratitis.|$|E
25|$|Conjunctivitis is {{identified}} by irritation and redness of the conjunctiva. Except in obvious pyogenic or toxic/chemical conjunctivitis, a slit lamp (biomicroscope) {{is needed to}} have any confidence in the diagnosis. Examination of the <b>tarsal</b> conjunctiva is usually more diagnostic than the bulbar conjunctiva.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the year}} white-tailed deer will rub-urinate, a process during which a deer squats while urinating so that urine will {{run down the}} insides of the deer's legs, over the <b>tarsal</b> glands, and onto the hair {{covering}} these glands. Bucks rub-urinate more frequently during the breeding season.|$|E
50|$|A 16 m {{individual}} of B. isis had 35 cm long hind limbs with fused <b>tarsals</b> {{and only}} three digits. The limited size of the limb {{and the absence of}} an articulation with the sacral vertebrae, makes a locomotory function unlikely.Analysis has shown that the reduced limbs could rapidly adduct between only two positions.|$|R
50|$|Short {{bones are}} {{designated}} as those bones {{that are as}} wide as they are long. Their primary function is to provide support and stability with little to no movement. They are one of five types of bones: short, long, flat, irregular and sesamoid. Examples of these bones include the <b>tarsals</b> in the foot and the carpals in the hand.|$|R
5000|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to determine the maturity of MNG 7722, it is thought to be an early adult. Poor ossification of the carpals, <b>tarsals,</b> and endochondral portion of the braincase suggest that MNG 7722 represents an early stage of development, while the pitted skull roof, with tightly closed sutures between bones, indicates a mature individual.|$|R
25|$|It {{is found}} {{exclusively}} in South Africa, particularly the Namaqualand region. As with other monkey beetles, blue monkey beetles have characteristically moveable and unequally sized <b>tarsal</b> claws, {{particularly on the}} strong hind legs of the males. Males of the species are covered in minute sky-blue scales while the scales of the females are sienna brown.|$|E
25|$|Corticosteroid {{injections}} {{into the}} lower hock joints may solve the lameness of the horse for several weeks or months. Unlike other joints, the drugs can be repeatedly injected {{into the lower}} <b>tarsal</b> joints as needed. Again, {{it is important to}} check association rules to see if corticosteroids are not allowed in competition, so that they may be discontinued before the horse competes.|$|E
25|$|The tibia of {{each leg}} bears a single tibial spur. The <b>tarsal</b> claws are double and unequal, with one weak, slender claw {{pressed against the}} larger, {{stronger}} claw. The claws of the hind legs are particularly large. In males the hind legs are also more strongly developed than in females, swollen and more robust through the femora, tibiae, and tarsi.|$|E
5|$|Also defined herewith: tarsometatarsus. The {{third and}} most {{conspicuous}} {{portion of the}} bird's leg, from which the toes spring; the foot. In birds, the true tarsus has disappeared, with the proximal <b>tarsals</b> having fused with the tibia, the centralia having disappeared, and the distal bones having fused with the metatarsals to form a single tarsometatarsus bone, effectively giving the leg a third segment.|$|R
50|$|The {{pelvic girdle}} also {{displays}} the same characteristics as the pectoral girdle. The femur is elongated and enlarged and place perpendicularly to the pelvic girdle. The proximal {{end of the}} femur was enlarged to allow strong muscle attachment and also displayed well developed <b>tarsals,</b> metatarsals,and phalanges that served the same purposes for mobility and flexibility of joints in their hindlimbs.|$|R
50|$|The {{articulated}} tail has elongate rod-like {{extensions of}} the prezygaphophyses and chevrons characteristic of most dromaeosaurids, and these reach almost to the most anterior caudals. The sternum is large, with a maximum anteroposterior length 56% of the femoral length and is long axially in proportion. Bone fusion in the scapula, vertebrae, coracoid, and <b>tarsals</b> suggest that the specimen is a mature adult weighing 0.31 kg, {{making it one of}} the smallest known non-avian theropods thus far discovered.|$|R
