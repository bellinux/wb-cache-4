25|$|The XP-47B was of {{all-metal}} construction (except for the fabric-covered <b>tail</b> <b>control</b> surfaces) with elliptical wings, with {{a straight}} leading edge that was slightly swept back. The air-conditioned cockpit was roomy and the pilot's seat was comfortable—"like a lounge chair", as one pilot later put it. The canopy doors hinged upward. Main and auxiliary self-sealing fuel tanks were placed under the cockpit, giving a total fuel capacity of 305U.S. gal (1,155L).|$|E
25|$|Three initial design {{concepts}} were {{developed for the}} Model 45, including one with the Bonanza's signature V-tail, but the final design that emerged in 1948 incorporated conventional <b>tail</b> <b>control</b> surfaces {{for the benefit of}} the more conservative military (featuring a relatively large unswept vertical fin that would find its way onto the Travel Air twin-engine civil aircraft almost ten years later). The Bonanza's fuselage with four-passenger cabin was replaced with a narrower fuselage incorporating a two-seater tandem cockpit and bubble canopy, which provided greater visibility for the trainee pilot and flight instructor. Structurally, the Model 45 was much stronger than the Bonanza, being designed for +10g and −4.5g, while the Continental E-185 engine of 185 horsepower (hp) at takeoff (less than a third of the power of the T-6's engine) was the same as that fitted to contemporary Bonanzas.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is predominantly}} made from carbon fiber. The wings have airfoils from the FX81 family of profiles.

2500|$|The {{empennage}} was conventional, with {{a straight}} edged, blunt topped fin and rudder. [...] The tailplane, semi-elliptical in plan, was mounted halfway up the fin, braced on each side {{with a pair of}} struts from the lower fuselage.

2500|$|While {{technically}} advanced, the Trident (and other aircraft with a T-tail arrangement) had {{potentially dangerous}} stalling characteristics. If its airspeed was insufficient, and particularly if its high-lift devices were not extended {{at the low}} speeds typical of climbing away after take-off or of approaching to land, it could enter a deep stall (or [...] "superstall") condition, in which the <b>tail</b> <b>control</b> surfaces become ineffective (as {{they are in the}} turbulence zone of the stalled main wing) from which recovery was practically impossible.|$|E
2500|$|The Type 146 was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with tapering {{wings of}} moderate dihedral {{on the outer}} sections. The wings were stress skinned with aluminium with only the ailerons and <b>tail</b> <b>control</b> surfaces fabric-covered. The two sets of four [...] Browning machine guns were housed in the outer wing sections. The undercarriage was mounted about halfway along the centre section and retracted cleanly inwards into the wing; the tailwheel was also fully retractable. In contrast to the Type 133, the fuselage was a monocoque structure. The cockpit was enclosed with a one-piece sliding canopy.|$|E

2500|$|The Highlander version, {{intended}} for rough airstrips and marketed {{only in the}} U.S.A., is designed to fly slowly and has a more robust undercarriage. Its wing has a 3ft (910mm) [...] greater span, with vortex generators over the whole upper leading edge, and the fin is square cornered and 8in (200mm) taller.

[...] A 99hp (74kW) Rotax 912 ULS engine is fitted and allows a maximum takeoff weight of 1,320lbs (598kg).|$|E
2500|$|The single engine, tandem, {{two seat}} I-12 was a {{development}} of the similarly laid out I-11, strengthened for aerobatics. It was an all wood low wing monoplane, entirely plywood covered apart from the <b>tail</b> <b>control</b> surfaces and with a fixed, conventional undercarriage. Its cantilever wing was built around a main and an auxiliary box spar, both made from spruce and plywood. The short wing centre section was integral with the fuselage, with the main undercarriage legs on it. [...] These and the wheels, fitted with brakes, were faired. [...] Outboard, the wing panels tapered to rounded tips, carrying both the balanced and slotted differential ailerons and hand operated camber changing split flaps.|$|E
2500|$|After {{making its}} maiden flight on 16 November 1962, the Marvelette {{was used in}} an {{extensive}} test program to evaluate the aircraft and its novel features. The aircraft retained the original [...] Continental C-90 engine of the AG-14, which powered the boundary control system {{as well as providing}} the propulsion for the aircraft. As the Marvellette was heavier than the original AG-14, the engine proved to be underpowered for its task. Nevertheless, the test successfully evaluated the novel features planned for the Marvel. The full-sized aircraft had a modified camber-changing mechanism and more conventional <b>tail</b> <b>control</b> surfaces. The Marvelette completed 25 test flights, with the last flight in March 1964, and was subsequently the platform for Marvel development ground tests before being dismantled.|$|E

In order to manage the difficulties associated with "zerodynamics" that arise in <b>tail</b> <b>controlled</b> missiles, two distinct approaches for approximate feedback linearization are advanced. The first approach imposes a time-scale structure in the closed-loop dynamics, while the second technique redefines the output.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a robust Feedback Linearization (FL) based pitch plane autopilot {{design for a}} highly maneuvering, skid-to-turn, <b>tail</b> <b>controlled</b> tactical missile. Owing to the highly nonlinear missile dynamics, firstly a feedback linearization based controller is proposed. As the resulting design lacks robustness, the issue is addressed by robustifyng the FL based controller using Extended State Observer (ESO). The system uncertainties are estimated by the ESO and the estimate {{is used in the}} FL control to nullify it’s effect. A novel feature of this technique {{is that it does not}} require any knowledge of the system uncertainty. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} bolted-together aluminum tubing, with its flying surfaces covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its 10.17 m span wing has an area of 17 m2 and is supported by V-struts and jury struts. There is a cabane strut that passes though the windshield and cockpit area. The aircraft is built around a central bent aluminum keel tube that runs from the cockpit to the <b>tail.</b> <b>Controls</b> are standard three-axis type.

50|$|Single-engined {{propeller}} {{aircraft are}} inherently asymmetric, as the propeller rotation direction {{and the resultant}} propwash gives a strongly asymmetric effect over the <b>tail</b> <b>control</b> surfaces, especially at low speeds during takeoff. As engines became more powerful, {{around the end of}} World War II, the last single piston-engined fighters used contra-rotating propellers both to handle this great power, and also to reduce their asymmetry.|$|E
50|$|Compared to the F-35A, the F-35C carrier variant {{features}} larger wings with foldable wingtip sections, larger {{wing and}} <b>tail</b> <b>control</b> surfaces for improved low-speed control, stronger landing gear for {{the stresses of}} carrier arrested landings, a twin-wheel nose gear, and a stronger tailhook for use with carrier arrestor cables. The larger wing area allows for decreased landing speed while increasing both range and payload.|$|E
50|$|The {{wing and}} <b>tail</b> <b>control</b> {{surfaces}} were fabric-covered, {{as well as}} the sides of the fuselage from just behind the firewall to the tail. The remainder of the aircraft was metal-covered and featured fixed (non-retractable) landing gear. The Army Air Corps purchased a total of 199 BT-9s, BT-9As and BT-9Bs.
