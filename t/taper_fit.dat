25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a <b>taper</b> <b>fit</b> into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E

In this paper, a model was developed to study {{the influence of the}} taper on the interference fit between a propeller hub and a shaft. Using the classic elastic plane stress theory, the exact solutions of the radial stresses, tangential stresses and radial displacements of the propeller hub and shaft are derived. Then the calculation method of the magnitude of the <b>tapered</b> interference <b>fit</b> was presented. Finally taking a screw propeller system as an example, the above solutions were calculated by using the numerical method. The results show that the taper {{plays a key role in}} the interference fit. Improving the stress distribution of the propeller hub is an effective approach to increase the connection strength.

The purpose is to allow a quick and easy change between different tools (either automatically or by hand) while ensuring the tool or toolholder will be tightly and rigidly connected to the spindle, and accurately coaxial with it.

50|$|An example:The {{allowance}} {{per inch}} of diameter usually ranges from 0.001 inch to 0.0025 inch (0.1-0.25%), 0.0015 inch (0.15%) being a fair average. Ordinarily the allowance per inch decreases as the diameter increases; thus the total allowance for {{a diameter of}} 2 inches (50.8 mm) might be 0.004 inch (0.102 mm, 0.2%), whereas for a diameter of 8 inches (203.2 mm) the total allowance might not be over 0.009 or 0.010 inch (0.23 or 0.25 mm, i.e. 0.11-0.12%). The parts to be assembled by forced fits are usually made cylindrical, although sometimes they are slightly tapered. Advantages of the taper form are: the possibility of abrasion of the fitted surfaces is reduced; less pressure is required in assembling; and parts are more readily separated when renewal is required. On the other hand, the <b>taper</b> <b>fit</b> is less reliable, because if it loosens, the entire fit is free with but little axial movement. Some lubricant, such as white lead and lard oil mixed to the consistency of paint, should {{be applied to the}} pin and bore before assembling, to reduce the tendency toward abrasion.|$|E

Criteria are measuring factors including interface connector attributes, such as the number, size, and weight; positioning attributes, such as the ease of position, and easy of handling; and operation attributes, such as accessibility, ease of assembly, tool applications. Geometry complexity includes parts’ size, shape and weight. Operation complexity considers fasteners’ operation and position. Values of these elements are assigned by weighting factors for their importance in interface operations, including parts connected, connectors used, geometry complexity, operation complexity, tools used in the operation, and operation accessibility.

40|$|In {{evaluation}} of the long-term success of a dental implant, the reliability and {{the stability of the}} implant-abutment interface plays a great role. <b>Tapered</b> interference <b>fits</b> provide a reliable connection method between the abutment and the implant. In this work, the mechanics of the <b>tapered</b> interference <b>fits</b> was analyzed using a closed-form formula and the finite element (FE) method. An analytical solution, which is used to predict the contact pressure in a straight interference, was modified to predict the contact pressure in the tapered implant-abutment interface. An elastic-plastic finite element model was used to simulate the material non-linearity of the implant and abutment material. The validity and the applicability of the analytical solution were investigated by comparisons with the FE model for a range of problem parameters. It was shown that the analytical solution could be used to determine the pull-out force and loosening-torque with 5 - 10 % accuracy. Detailed analysis of the stress distribution due to <b>tapered</b> interference <b>fit,</b> in a commercially available, abutment-implant system was carried out. This analysis shows that plastic deformation in the implant limits the increase in the pull-out force that would have been otherwise predicted by higher interference values...|$|R

40|$|A {{new form}} of surface {{junction}} thermocouple sensor has been developed and tested. The novel feature of the design {{is the use of}} a <b>tapered</b> <b>fit</b> between two coaxial thermocouple elements to form a thin, robust junction. The gauge has a response time on the order of 1 µs and is suitable for measuring large transient heat fluxes in hypervelocity wind tunnels. Asymptotic analysis is used to demonstrate the operating principles and to assess the errors associated with the finite thickness of the surface junction. Spectral deconvolution methods are used to infer a mean square optimal estimate of the surface heat flux from time resolved surface temperature measurements. This improved signal processing method is applicable to transient heat flux gauges of all types. Potential reducible error sources and other systematic errors are described. Measurements of the heat flux about the forebody of a cylindrical body in a hypervelocity flow demonstrate the functioning of the gauge and are used to obtain statistical estimates of the repeatability of the technique. The measured heat fluxes are compared with established theoretical predictions...|$|R

The micromirror is formed from a single mode fiber that has been <b>tapered</b> to <b>fit</b> into the hollow core and fixed in place using a fusion splicer. A large range of reflectivities higher than 4 % was also achieved by silver-coating the silica tapered-fiber end-face using thermal evaporation. The current micromirror provides two key advantages over using a full-sized fiber splice to create a reflective interface. First, the tapered fiber tip can be coated to increase the reflectivity without degradation due to heating during the splicing process. Second, increased efficiency of input and output coupling is possible because of improved mode-field overlap with the fundamental mode of the HC-PCF.
