25|$|I'm just shocked. It's unbelievable. I {{feel like}} my dream has come true, the dream I've been dreaming since a little girl has come true.

He announced many games {{over the years and}} he became well known for his way of announcing “Jose Cruuuuuuz.” “ is the one to come out with the way they announced my name.” Jose Cruz commented. Once Duckett said: “Strangers are always <b>telling</b> <b>me,</b> 'I've heard that voice. I just don't know where.” In 1992 he left the Astros.|$|E
25|$|In the {{old days}} I had looked up to MacDonald as a great leader. He had a fine {{presence}} and great oratorical power. The unpopular line which he took during the First World War seemed to mark {{him as a man}} of character. Despite his mishandling of the Red Letter episode, I had not appreciated his defects until he took office a second time. I then realised his reluctance to take positive action and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery, while his habit of <b>telling</b> <b>me,</b> a junior Minister, the poor opinion he had of all his Cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression. I had not, however, expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political history of this country... The shock to the Party was very great, especially to the loyal workers of the rank-and-file who had made great sacrifices for these men.|$|E

500|$|Volk {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan in 1963. His decision to attend Michigan rather than Ohio State was influenced by family ties, including Bob Chappuis, who was Volk's uncle and {{finished second in the}} Heisman Trophy voting while playing for the undefeated 1947 Wolverines. Volk noted:"I had all these stories growing up. He [...] was my hero, so I always wanted to go to Michigan. ... And I didn't like Woody [...] anyway.

500|$|Azalea found [...] "Bounce" [...] to be {{different}} from her previous releases and the most commercial song on The New Classic. She initially felt that it was a risky choice for a single, and consulted Nas regarding the decision; [...] "With 'Bounce,' I was like, 'It's a pop record. I don't know.' [...] was like, 'Just fucking do it. It's something different. It's one song, what's the big deal?' I couldn't believe Nas was <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> to do a hip-pop record." [...] Azalea also did not intend to include the song on The New Classic, believing that it strayed too far from the album's musical and lyrical themes, but her record label convinced her otherwise and it was included as one of the album's three bonus tracks. The song was later included in the main track listing of the album's reissue, Reclassified.|$|E
