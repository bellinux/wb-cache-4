I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been having a good many dreams of lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.|$|E

500|$|Beecham was {{dismissive of}} some of the {{established}} classics, saying for example, [...] "I would give the whole of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos for Massenet's Manon, and would <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> vastly profited by the exchange". [...] He was, by contrast, famous for presenting slight pieces as encores, which he called [...] "lollipops". Some of the best-known were Berlioz's Danse des sylphes; Chabrier's Joyeuse Marche and Gounod's Le Sommeil de Juliette.|$|E

500|$|Slayer {{embarked}} on the Reign in Pain tour with the bands Overkill in the United States and Malice in Europe; they {{also served as}} the opening act for W.A.S.P.'s U.S. tour in 1987. In late November 1986, drummer Lombardo quit the band; he said: [...] "I wasn't making any money. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> just gotten married, and I figured if we were gonna be doing this professionally—on a major label—I wanted my rent and utilities paid."

500|$|According to {{journalist}} and Britain's Got Talent judge Piers Morgan, Talbot's performances resulted in many children, including Faryl Smith, auditioning {{for the second}} series of the show. After his victory, series 2 winner George Sampson spoke of his participation in the first series, where he was knocked out before the live shows, saying [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> any shot of winning last year... When {{you look at the}} standard of Paul Potts and Connie Talbot. Paul Potts is out of this league, and Connie is out of this league – I wasn't good enough." [...] Talbot voted for Sampson, saying [...] "I liked his dancing – he was good on the lamppost".|$|E
500|$|Although Piquet's {{result was}} fortuitous, Renault Engineering Director, Pat Symonds, {{subsequently}} praised him for {{stepping up to}} the job of staying with the leaders in the final stint of the race. Meanwhile, Massa commented that his car was not in good order during the race: [...] "It was just slow with difficult stability and also on braking I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a little problem as well and lost a lot of performance. I didn’t have the car to fight. I tried but it was not possible." [...] Teammate Räikkönen also struggled with low grip and hot brakes {{for the duration of the}} race, while Kovalainen and Kubica had problems with their tyres.|$|E
500|$|Until now, Cardinale's {{own voice}} {{had not been}} used in her Italian films, as it was {{considered}} too hoarse, and owing to [...] her French accent, insufficiently Italian. Not until 8½ was she allowed to use her own voice. Cardinale explained: [...] "When I arrived for my first movie, I couldn't speak a word. I thought I was on the moon. I couldn't understand {{what they were talking}} about. And I was speaking in French; in fact I was dubbed. And Federico Fellini was the first one who used my voice. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a very strange voice." [...] With her portrayal of Angelica in The Leopard and her brief appearance as herself in 8½, Cardinale achieved the definitive status of a top-ranking star.|$|E

[...] Because of this, his asides to the viewer serves as an indication of Underwood's true feelings and intentions - typically when he is feigning politeness and courtesy to people whom he despises. In the season 2 premiere, after having gone the whole episode without doing so, Underwood addresses the viewer directly, saying, [...] "Did you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> forgotten you? Perhaps you hoped I had."

500|$|Cele Goldsmith's {{tenure as}} editor {{began with the}} {{opportunity}} to showcase two very well-established writers: E.E. Smith and Isaac Asimov. Smith's The Galaxy Primes began serialization in March 1959. Asimov's first published story, [...] "Marooned off Vesta", had appeared in the March 1939 issue of Amazing, and Goldsmith reprinted it in March 1959 along with a sequel and Asimov's comments on the story. She soon began to publish some of the better new writers. Cordwainer Smith's [...] "Golden the Ship Was—Oh! Oh! Oh!" [...] appeared in April; and {{by the middle of the}} following year she had managed to attract stories from Robert Sheckley, Alan E. Nourse, Fritz Leiber, Gordon R. Dickson, Robert Bloch, and James Blish. The changes she made were enough to bring Robert Heinlein back as a subscriber; Heinlein read a copy of the June 1961 issue, which, he said, [...] "... caused me to <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been missing something." ...|$|E
500|$|Several suicides were {{connected}} to the campaign, including a Cuban gay activist in Miami named Ovidio [...] "Herbie" [...] Ramos, who was stunned at the vehemence against homosexuals. He and several other Cuban gay activists participated in a radio call-in show to hear people say homosexuals should be deported, forced into concentration camps, or executed. Ramos shot himself {{a few days later}} after telling a friend, [...] "I didn't know they hated us so much". Another Cuban gay activist named Manolo Gomez was fired from his job and severely beaten, after which he decided to leave Miami. Gay activists in New Orleans tried to discourage Bryant's performance with the New Orleans Pops orchestra by connecting local suicides to her campaign. Bryant responded to violence saying, [...] "It made me sad and shocked me that anyone would <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> anything to do with it, but my conscience is clear. I can't be responsible for how people react to what happened in Dade County. My stand was not taken out of homophobia, but of love for them." ...|$|E

500|$|Aronofsky had {{the idea}} for The Wrestler for over a decade. He hired Robert D. Siegal to turn his idea into a script. The actor Nicolas Cage entered {{negotiations}} in October 2007 to star as Randy, the film's protagonist. The following month Cage left the project, and Mickey Rourke replaced him in the lead role. Aronofsky said that Cage {{pulled out of the}} movie because Aronofsky wanted Rourke to star; Aronofsky said, stating that Cage was [...] "a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but, you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race." [...] Cage responded, [...] "I wasn't quote 'dropped' from the movie. I resigned from the movie because I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> enough time to achieve the look of the wrestler who was on steroids, which I would never do". The roughly 40-day shoot began in January 2008.|$|E
500|$|As a small child, Minaj and {{a sibling}} {{lived with her}} {{grandmother}} in Saint James. Her mother, who had moved to The Bronx, New York to attend Monroe College, brought the family to Queens, New York, when Minaj was 5. By then the family had a house on West 147th Street. Minaj recalled, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a lot of discipline in my household. My mom motivated me, but it wasn't a strict household. I kind of wanted a strict household." [...] Minaj successfully auditioned for admission to LaGuardia High School in Manhattan, which focuses on visual and performing arts. After graduation, Minaj wanted to become an actress, and she was cast in the Off-Broadway play In Case You Forget in 2001. At the age of 19, as she struggled with her acting career, {{she worked as a}} waitress at Red Lobster in the Bronx, but was fired for discourtesy to customers. She said she was fired from [...] "at least fifteen jobs" [...] for similar reasons. She also worked as an administrative assistant, in customer service and as an office manager for a Wall Street business.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{produced}} and mixed by Max Martin and Rami Yacoub. Max Martin {{began working on}} the song at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden in mid-2001 and Spears recorded in June {{of the same year}} at Battery Studios in New York City, New York. The June 20, 2001 recording session aired on MTV Diary on September 1, 2001. Background vocals were provided by Martin and Jeanette Oison. Spears considered the song as one of her favorites, while praising Dido for [...] her input into its songwriting, saying [...] "it was truly an honor for you to be part of my album. Thanks for your input." [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" [...] is a pop power ballad, founded on a strong piano melody, that lasts for three minutes and 49 seconds. The song is composed in the key of E♭ major and is set in time signature of common time, with a moderately slow tempo of 76 beats per minute. The song's lyrics talk about the angst and heartache that teenage girls suffer with puberty, where Spears claims, [...] "I used to <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the answers to everything." [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" [...] has a basic sequence of E♭–A♭2–Fm7–B♭ as its chord progression.|$|E

500|$|On 8 February 2010 he {{announced}} his resignation from Fine Gael and from Dáil Éireann, due to having [...] "virtually no influence or input" [...] into shaping Fine Gael's economic policies {{at a time of}} economic upheaval. It emerged that on 2 February, Lee met with the Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny and told him of his intention to resign. Kenny then offered Lee the frontbench position as spokesman on economic planning. Speaking to reporters outside Leinster House soon after his announcement, Lee said it would have been dishonest of him to accept the position: [...] "I had absolutely no input for nine months. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to be honest with myself and honest with the electorate about that and not pretend." [...] Asked if his resignation was a vote of no confidence in Kenny, Lee said there were [...] "certainly lots of large mutterings at the moment in relation to the leader's position". He said he had [...] "minimal involvement" [...] with Fine Gael finance spokesman Richard Bruton. [...] "I had a maximum of two or three conversations with Richard Bruton in a total nine months period. I don’t know how my relationship is with [...] " [...] Lee said.|$|E
500|$|Azaria did {{not expect}} to hear from the show again, but they {{continued}} to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He felt that, initially, [...] " [...] didn't seem too pleased with what I had done... was very exacting... was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I {{thought it was going to}} be my last week because I really didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done that well." [...] Nevertheless, by the show's second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. Since he joined later than the rest of the cast, Groening still considered Azaria the [...] "new guy". In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, Lou, Snake Jailbird, Kirk Van Houten, the Sea Captain, Superintendent Chalmers, Disco Stu, Duffman, the Wiseguy and numerous one-time characters. His co-star in The Simpsons, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: [...] "The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star." ...|$|E
500|$|Ralph Waldo Emerson never {{joined the}} Brook Farm community, despite several invitations. He wrote to Ripley on December 15, 1840, of his [...] "conviction that the Community {{is not good}} for me". He also {{questioned}} the idealism of the community, particularly its optimism that all members would equally share responsibility and workload. As he wrote, [...] "The country members naturally were surprised to observe that one man ploughed all day and one looked out of a window all day... and both received at night the same wages". Twenty years later, Emerson publicly denounced the experiment in his collection of essays titled The Conduct of Life. Charles Lane, {{one of the founders of}} another community called Fruitlands, thought the Brook Farmers lived a lifestyle that did not sacrifice enough. As he said, they were [...] "playing away their youth and day-time in a miserably joyous frivolous manner". Like other communities, Brook Farm was criticized for its potential to break up the nuclear family because of its focus on working as a larger community. After its conversion to Fourierism, the Transcendentalists showed less support for the experiment. Henry David Thoreau questioned the community members' idealism and wrote in his journal, [...] "As for these communities, I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> rather keep bachelor's hall in hell than go to board in heaven". Even Sophia Ripley later questioned their original optimism, referring to it as [...] "childish, empty, & sad".|$|E
