5|$|After {{an absence}} of <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> the music scene, Miguel {{announced}} on 19 July 1999 that he would release an album by September, saying {{it would be a}} return to pop recordings as opposed to the bolero cover versions he had recorded on the Romance series. The record's final title, Amarte Es un Placer was announced on 17 August 1999.|$|E
5|$|Early in production, Warner Bros. {{decided to}} release Phantasm as a {{theatrical}} release, rather than straight to video. That left {{less than a}} year for production time (most animated features take well over <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> finished story to final release). Due to this decision, the animators went over the scenes in order to accommodate the widescreen theatrical aspect ratio. The studio cooperated well, granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control.|$|E

5|$|In November 1874, several {{shipowners}} were contracted for <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> the South Australian {{government to}} provide ten round trips between the colonial capital of Adelaide and its furthest outpost, Port Darwin. Port Darwin was feeling {{the effects of}} a gold rush at Pine Creek and growing quickly as a trade post with the Dutch East Indies. However, all the local banks sent their money, together with government paperwork and the Royal Mail, around the east coast to Adelaide. On successful completion of each voyage, the South Australian government would pay the owners £1000 sterling.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} off-season, Cloutier's remaining year {{on his contract}} was bought out by the Kings on June 21, 2008. As teams cannot buyout the contract of an injured player, Cloutier claimed he was not healthy and contested the move. However, the NHL ruled in favour of the Kings; the buyout stood and Cloutier became an unrestricted free agent. Consequently, he received $2 {{million over the next}} <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> the Kings.|$|E
5|$|One {{circumstance}} {{which may}} call for issuance {{of a second}} passport of a particular type is a prolonged visa-processing delay especially for Angola and São Tomé and Príncipe visa applications. Another is safety or security. The period of validity of a second passport issued under either circumstance is generally <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> the date of issue.|$|E

5|$|The {{city was}} {{captured}} by Great Britain in 1762 {{as part of the}} European Seven Years' War between Spain, France and Great Britain. The city was then occpuied by the British for almost <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> 1762 to 1764 and remained the capital of the Philippines. Eventually, the British withdrew in accordance with the 1763 Treaty of Paris. An unknown number of Indian soldiers known as sepoys, who came with the British, deserted and settled in nearby Cainta, Rizal, which explains the uniquely Indian features of generations of Cainta residents.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Mackensens, the three ships of the Ersatz Yorck class were never completed. This was {{primarily}} due to shifting wartime construction priorities; U-boats were deemed more important to Germany's war effort, and so work on other types of ships was slowed or halted outright. The lead ship, Ersatz Yorck, was the only vessel of the three to have construction begin, though she was over <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> completion by the time work was abandoned. With the hull incomplete, the ship could not be launched and towed to ship-breakers; as a result, Ersatz Yorck was broken up in situ.|$|E
5|$|For <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> <b>from</b> 1948–1950, {{work was}} done on the new {{building}} connected to the rectory by the arch. The three-story building was made of flexicore slab and the outside was made from a mixture of new and old bricks {{in the back and}} Michigan red sandstone in the front, so that the building was the same color as the buildings to which it was adjoined. The interior of the building was plastered by one of the best plasterers in the area, Dom Graziano, who {{was the son of a}} parishioner. He did all of the plastering for free.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, {{after he}} unsuccessfully {{applied for a}} job with Canada's National Research Council, the University of Chicago {{accepted}} him as a research associate. There, Slotin gained his first experience with nuclear chemistry, helping to build the first cyclotron in the midwestern United States. The job paid poorly and Slotin's father had to support him for <b>two</b> <b>years.</b> <b>From</b> 1939 to 1940, Slotin collaborated with Earl Evans, {{the head of the}} university's biochemistry department, to produce radiocarbon (carbon-14 and carbon-11) from the cyclotron. While working together, the two men also used carbon-11 to demonstrate that plant cells had the capacity to use carbon dioxide for carbohydrate synthesis, through carbon fixation.|$|E
5|$|Luoyang, {{the region}} of his birthplace, was {{recovered}} by government forces {{in the winter of}} 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill-health (by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments). They stayed in Kuizhou (in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing) {{at the entrance to the}} Three Gorges for almost <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> late spring 766. This period was Du Fu's last great poetic flowering, and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense, late style.|$|E
5|$|Tharoor {{is also an}} {{acclaimed}} writer, having authored 16 bestselling {{works of}} fiction and non-fiction since 1981, {{all of which are}} centred on India and its history, culture, film, politics, society, foreign policy, and more. He {{is also the author of}} hundreds of columns and articles in publications such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, TIME, Newsweek, and The Times of India. He was a contributing editor for Newsweek International for <b>two</b> <b>years.</b> <b>From</b> 2010 to 2012, he wrote a column in The Asian Age/Deccan Chronicle and, for most of 2012, until his appointment as Minister, a column in Mail Today; he also writes an internationally syndicated monthly column for Project Syndicate.

5|$|The station {{consists}} of two side platforms situated under street level, with two mezzanines connecting to the surface at James Street and Yesler Way in Seattle's Pioneer Square neighborhood. It opened on September 15, 1990, and was used exclusively by buses until 2009. The tunnel and stations closed for almost <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> <b>from</b> 2005 to 2007, for renovation and modifications to accommodate light rail trains. Link light rail service to Pioneer Square station began on July 18, 2009, {{the first day of}} Central Link operations. Trains and buses serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between light rail trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times.|$|E
5|$|Walsh was {{employed}} with the FBI until 1942 when, as a Reserve Marine Lieutenant, {{he took a}} leave to serve with the United States Marine Corps during World War II. After he left, Hoover refused to allow any more active agents {{to be members of}} any military reserve. He fought in the Pacific Theater, specifically on Okinawa and in North China. In one incident, he and his comrades were pinned down by a sniper, whom Walsh was able to kill from 90 yards away with a single shot to the torso from a M1911 pistol. He earned the rank of Colonel and returned to the FBI for <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> 1946–1947. In total, during his tenure with the agency, he killed between 11 and 17 suspects.|$|E
5|$|A {{technology}} demo for Forza Motorsport 4 {{was first}} revealed at Microsoft's E3 2010 press conference. The live demonstration showcased a passing challenge while driving the 2010 Ferrari 458 Italia. Using the Microsoft Kinect sensor the player steered {{the car to}} pass opponents. Forza Motorsport 4 was formally unveiled at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards. Turn 10 announced that the game would feature over 500 cars from 80 manufacturers, and confirmed that it will support Kinect as well as standard Xbox 360 controllers and racing wheels. Turn 10 officially partnered with the American Le Mans Series (ALMS) for <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> August 8, 2011. The partnership provides several in-game ALMS themed events to complement the cars and tracks raced in the ALMS present in previous entries in the Forza Motorsport series. Unlike past games in the series, vehicles from the SCCA Pro Racing World Challenge were not present initially in Forza Motorsport 4 aside from a Mopar sponsored Dodge Viper. The Porsche download content pack added one World Challenge Porsche GT3. More known content was leaked during IGN's visit to E3 2011, which revealed {{that there will be}} the option to create car clubs and share garages within that club, and that the game will support 16 player online racing. Hockenheimring, Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Infineon Raceway were added as three more real world tracks to the Forza series.|$|E

5|$|Eventually {{promoted}} to Temporary Flying Officer, Brooks began {{working for the}} Missing Research and Enquiry Service (MRES), which was an initiative to locate individuals from the Commonwealth of Nations who were missing or killed in action during World War II over hostile territory. He worked with the service for nearly <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> <b>from</b> November 1945 through July 1947, as a Search Officer in Denmark, Norway, and as a Section Leader in the American Zone of Germany. Brooks and a colleague sailed a fishing smack around Cape Nordkinn in the Arctic Circle, the most northerly coastal point of the mainland of Europe, {{in the search for}} missing airmen. It was during his tenure with MRES that he met his wife Birthe. He also played ice hockey during his downtime in Scandinavia with the U.S. Army Allstars, and was selected {{to be a member of}} Canada's national delegation to the 1948 Winter Olympics. This squad, known as the Ottawa RCAF Flyers, consisted entirely of members of the Royal Canadian Air Force.|$|E
5|$|He {{joined the}} Oxford Playhouse in 1951 and worked {{there for three}} years, {{appearing}} in plays such as He Who Gets Slapped as the clown. Peter Hall worked with Barker at Oxford and gave him his break, casting him as the Chantyman and Joe Silva in his production of Mourning Becomes Electra at the Arts Theatre in London's West End in 1955. By {{the time he had}} made it to the West End, Barker had appeared in an estimated 350 plays. Barker remained a West End actor for several years, appearing in numerous plays between 1955 and 1968. These included, in 1955, two performances each night as he played a gypsy in Listen to the Wind at the Arts Theatre and then a peasant in Summertime later in the evening. Other roles included Mr Thwaites in Double Image in 1956 (with Olivier), Camino Real (directed by Hall) in 1957, French gangster Robertoles-Diams in Irma La Douce for <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> 1958, Lord Slingsby-Craddock in Mr Whatnot in 1964 and Birdboot in The Real Inspector Hound in 1968. He also appeared in several Royal Court Theatre productions, including A Midsummer Night's Dream as Quince.|$|E
5|$|Lutosławski started {{piano lessons}} in Warsaw for <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> {{the age of}} six. After the Polish-Soviet War the family left Warsaw to return to Drozdowo, {{but after a few}} years of running the estates with limited success, his mother {{returned}} to Warsaw. She worked as a physician, and translated books for children from English. In 1924 Lutosławski entered secondary school (Stefan Batory Gymnasium) while continuing piano lessons. A performance of Karol Szymanowski's Third Symphony deeply affected him. In 1925 he started violin lessons at the Warsaw Music School. In 1931 he enrolled at Warsaw University to study mathematics, and in 1932 he formally joined the composition classes at the Conservatory. His only composition teacher was Witold Maliszewski, a renowned Polish composer who had been a pupil of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Lutosławski was given a strong grounding in musical structures, particularly movements in sonata form. In 1932 he gave up the violin, and in 1933 he discontinued his mathematics studies to concentrate on the piano and composition. As a student of Jerzy Lefeld, he gained a diploma for piano performance from the Conservatory in 1936, after presenting a virtuoso program including Schumann's Toccata and Beethoven's fourth piano concerto. His diploma for composition was awarded by the same institution in 1937.|$|E
