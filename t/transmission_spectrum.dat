For the both cases, we assumed to put a neutron detector at downstream of the sample and took into account the detector efficiency of neutrons to estimate statistics. ANNRI gives high statistical neutron <b>transmission</b> <b>spectra.</b> Therefore, it is useful for obtaining the total cross-section data through the <b>transmission</b> <b>spectra</b> for the small amount sample or the small cross-section regions between the resonances not only for monitoring the beam condition during the neutron capture-reaction measurements at ANNRI. On the other hand, a compact neutron source shows <b>transmission</b> <b>spectra</b> at resonances with less deformation by its single bunch beam. This implies that the compact neutron source is useful for assigning the resonances and the resonance analysis...|$|R

In addition, many designs of first-generation WSS (particularly those based on MEMs technology) show pronounced dips in the <b>transmission</b> <b>spectrum</b> between each channel due to the limited spectral ‘fill factor’ inherent in these designs. This prevents the simple concatenation of adjacent channels to create a single broader channel.|$|E

50|$|In {{follow-up}} observations by larger telescopes, powerful means will {{be available}} to probe the atmospheric composition of exoplanets discovered by NGTS. For example, during secondary eclipse, when the star occults the planet, a comparison between the in-transit and out-of-transit flux allows computation of a difference spectrum representing the thermal emission of the planet. Calculation of the <b>transmission</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the planet's atmosphere can be obtained by measuring the small spectral changes in the spectrum of the star that arise during the planet's transit. This technique requires an extremely high signal-to-noise ratio, and has thus far been successfully applied to only a few planets orbiting small, nearby, relatively bright stars, such as HD 189733 b and GJ 1214 b. NGTS is intended to greatly increase the number of planets that area analyzable using such techniques. Simulations of expected NGTS performance reveal the potential of discovering approximately 231 Neptune- and 39 super-Earth-sized planets amenable to detailed spectrographic analysis by the VLT, compared to only 21 Neptune- and 1 super-Earth-sized planets from the Kepler data.|$|E

5000|$|A long-period {{fiber grating}} couples {{light from a}} guided mode into forward {{propagating}} cladding modes where it is lost due to absorption and scattering. The coupling from the guided mode to cladding modes is wavelength dependent so we can obtain a spectrally selective loss.It is an optical fiber structure with the properties periodically varying along the fiber, such that the conditions for the interaction of several copropagating modes are satisfied. The period of such a structure is {{of the order of}} a fraction of a millimeter. In contrast to the fiber Bragg gratings, LPFGs couple copropagating modes with close propagation constants; therefore, the period of such a grating can considerably exceed the wavelength of radiation propagating in the fiber. Because the period of an LPFG is much larger than the wavelength, LPFGs are relatively simple to manufacture. Since LPFGs couple copropagating modes, their resonances can only be observed in transmission spectra. The <b>transmission</b> <b>spectrum</b> has dips at the wavelengths corresponding to resonances with various cladding modes (in a single-mode fiber).|$|E

This formula {{is identical to the}} one given previously with the exception that it has been augmented by the [...] coefficients which encode the deviation of the sample normalized spectrum from the average normalized spectrum. Where the sample beer has a normalized spectrum close to the average the c's are small and it is remarkable how often this is the case. Typically one or two augmentation coefficients are sufficient and they are frequently small enough that one or more can be neglected. For example, an imported ale with SRM equal to 6.8 has coefficients -0.07 and -0.1. Using both these coefficients one obtains color accuracy of less than one L*a*b* space unit (the limit of perception) in up to a 10 cm path under Illuminant C. Using just the SRM for this beer gives a reasonably good description of its color with error of about 4 L*a*b* units. Beers which deviate dramatically from the [...] "average" [...] spectrum are easily accommodated. Thus a sample of Kriek (Belgian cherry beer), has an SRM of 15.27. Were its color to be reconstructed from just the SRM it would be the color of an [...] "average" [...] beer which will be dark amber not the red of a Kriek. Including 3 coeffiecents (1.8, 0.8 and -0.1) yields color accuracy of less than 1 L*a*b* unit in paths up to 8 cm again under Illuminant C.|$|E

Furthermore, the changes in FWHM of up to 50 %, in the FSR range, seen in Fig. 6 a are ascribed to noise. Any noise in the system may be due to temperature fluctuations.
