5|$|Hungary {{recognised}} Croatian independence on 15 January 1992 (with {{the rest}} of the European Economic Community member states), and established diplomatic relations with Croatia three days later. During the Croatian War of Independence, Croatia obtained arms from several countries (including Hungary), despite a United Nations-imposed arms embargo. As of December 2011, Hungary and Croatia have 96 <b>treaties</b> <b>and</b> <b>agreements</b> in force regulating a wide range of activities and relations (including diplomatic, cultural, economic, energy, transport, education, minority and other issues). Furthermore, Hungary supported the Croatian NATO membership request and Croatian accession to the European Union.|$|E
5|$|Frank E. Holman, {{president}} of the American Bar Association (ABA), called attention to Federal court decisions, notably Missouri v. Holland, which he claimed could give international <b>treaties</b> <b>and</b> <b>agreements</b> precedence over the United States Constitution and {{could be used by}} foreigners to threaten American liberties. Senator Bricker was influenced by the ABA's work and first introduced a constitutional amendment in 1951. With substantial popular support and the election of a Republican president and Congress in the elections of 1952, together with support from many Southern Democrats, Bricker's plan seemed destined to be sent to the individual states for ratification.|$|E
5|$|From 1944, the Allies became {{increasingly}} concerned with laying {{the framework of}} post-war Europe. These were formalized through numerous <b>treaties</b> <b>and</b> <b>agreements</b> from 1944. In July 1944, Camille Gutt attended the Bretton Woods Conference in the United States {{on behalf of the}} Belgian government, establishing the Bretton Woods System of currency controls. During the negotiations, Gutt served as an important intermediary between the delegates of the major Allied powers. Through the agreements, the Belgian Franc's exchange rate would be tied to the American Dollar after the war, while the conference also established the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of which Gutt would serve as the first director.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik ("Eastern Policy") {{at the end}} of the 1960s reduced tensions between the two German states. It led to a series of <b>treaties</b> <b>and</b> <b>agreements</b> in the early 1970s, most significantly a treaty in which East and West Germany recognised each other's sovereignty and supported each other's applications for UN membership, although East Germans leaving for the West retained the right to claim a West German passport. Reunification remained a theoretical objective for West Germany, but in practice that objective was put aside by the West and abandoned entirely by the East. New crossing points were established and East German crossing regulations were slightly relaxed, although the fortifications were as rigorously maintained as ever.|$|E
5|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{combines}} NASA's Space Station Freedom {{project with}} the Soviet/Russian Mir-2 station, the European Columbus station, and the Japanese Kibō laboratory module. NASA originally planned in the 1980s to develop Freedom alone, but US budget constraints {{led to the}} merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993, managed by NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The station consists of pressurized modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components, which have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and the US Space Shuttles. It is currently being assembled in Low Earth Orbit. The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, {{the completion of the}} US Orbital Segment occurred in 2011 and the completion of the Russian Orbital Segment is expected by 2016. The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental <b>treaties</b> <b>and</b> <b>agreements</b> which divide the station into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception of Zarya), with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.|$|E

25|$|The United Kingdom is {{party to}} a number of {{international}} <b>treaties</b> <b>and</b> <b>agreements</b> which guarantee fundamental human rights and freedoms.

The provisions of unincorporated treaties can have nevertheless an impact on domestic law in a certain number of situations including the interpretation of legislation, the consideration of public policy and the assessment of the legality of the exercise of administrative discretion. In particular, there is a presumption that Parliament does not intend to legislate in a manner contrary to international agreements which have been ratified by the United Kingdom but not incorporated into domestic law. This presumption is capable of rebuttal by reference to Hansard in accordance with the principle established in Pepper v Hart.|$|E

25|$|At the Eighth Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party {{which lasted}} from 26 February to 8 March 1948, Xoxe was implicated in {{a plot to}} isolate Hoxha and {{consolidate}} his own power. He accused Hoxha of being responsible for the decline in relations with Yugoslavia, and stated that a Soviet military mission should be expelled {{in favor of a}} Yugoslav counterpart. Hoxha managed to remain firm and his support had not declined. When Yugoslavia publicly broke with the Soviet Union, Hoxha's support base grew stronger. Then, on 1 July 1948, Tirana called on all Yugoslav technical advisors to leave the country and unilaterally declared all <b>treaties</b> <b>and</b> <b>agreements</b> between the two countries null and void. Xoxe was expelled from the party and on 13 June 1949 he was executed by hanging.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{tensions}} between the two German states eased with the inauguration of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik. The Brandt government sought to normalise relations between West Germany and its eastern neighbours, and produced a series of <b>treaties</b> <b>and</b> <b>agreements.</b> Most significantly, on 21December 1972 the two German states signed a treaty recognising each other's sovereignty and supporting each other's applications for UN membership (achieved in September 1973). Reunification remained a theoretical objective for West Germany, but in practice the issue was put to one side by the West and was abandoned entirely by the East. The agreement had significant implications for the border. The two Germanies established a border commission (Grenzkommission) which met from 1973 to the mid-1980s to resolve practical problems related to the border. The normalisation of relations also led to a slight relaxation in the regulations for crossing the border legally, although the border fortifications were as rigorously maintained as ever.|$|E
25|$|Harry Johnston was {{appointed}} {{as the first}} Commissioner of the British Central Africa Protectorate in July 1891. Johnston did not consider that the Crown had a general claim to sovereignty over any land unless it had been expressly transferred by cession. Without sovereignty, the Crown {{had no right to}} alienate that land. However, some treaties made after July 1891 did cede sovereignty over land, but granted the communities involved the right to retain any land that they actually occupied as Crown tenants, leaving any vacant land free for the Crown to alienate. He also accepted that the <b>treaties</b> <b>and</b> <b>agreements</b> made {{before the start of the}} protectorate might be evidence of sales of land. Even though he accepted that the land belonged to its African communities, not the chiefs, Johnston proposed the legal fiction that the people had given their chiefs the right to sell it. This interpretation validated the chiefs’ sales and grants of unused land to Europeans. He also claimed that he was entitled to investigate whether these sales were valid and, if they were, to issue Certificates of Claim (in effect a registration of freehold title over the land to the new owners.|$|E
