The three-dimensional (3 D) finite difference models were built to investigate stresses, displacements and damages in the surrounding rocks of the entry and the <b>working</b> <b>face.</b> The field study includes selection of reinforcing methods and materials, design parameters, and determination of cable prestress. The monitoring data of entry deformation and stress along the cables during every stage were presented. The state of the reinforced entry was evaluated based on the monitoring data. The results demonstrate that before the heading face of the entry crosses the adjacent <b>working</b> <b>face,</b> the influence of advanced abutment pressure caused by adjacent <b>working</b> <b>face</b> upon the entry is not significant. After they cross each other, however, the lateral abutment pressure will have an evident impact on the entry.

The fully-grouted cable with short length, high strength and high prestress is an effective way to reinforce the entry suffering from severe mining-induced stresses, which greatly reduces the displacement and failure possibility of the entry.
