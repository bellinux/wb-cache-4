500|$|The {{committee}} professes <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>me</b> {{very useful}} in unravelling the conundrums sent {{down by the}} finance committee... The last two nights I have found the drafting committee fagged [...] and despairing, {{and now they have}} pitched the conundrums at me and gone out for a smoke; and then I worked out algebraic formulas to clear the thing up, drafted clauses accordingly, and when the committee returned we had plain sailing.|$|E
500|$|The {{second game}} {{received}} mixed to positive reviews, with a reviewer from PC Gamer commenting {{that what he}} had hoped for in the sequel [...] "was more mind games and more uncertainty. I wanted the plodding animatronic suits <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>me</b> and rip my face off in new and interesting ways. I wanted working legs", and that [...] "what I got was a horror game dipping heavily into deception and subtlety". However, {{he also noted that}} [...] "enjoying the good parts, though, comes with a cost of a frustratingly steep difficulty". Destructoid also gave the game a positive review, saying that [...] "It's absolutely terrifying to know that you could be attacked at any moment from multiple avenues" [...] and also praised the introduction of new animatronics and mechanics, but also criticizing the jumpscares and calling the game [...] "too hard for its own good".|$|E
6000|$|... “It is {{the hardest}} {{thing in the world}} to be in love, and yet attend [...] business. As for me, all who speak <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>find</b> <b>me</b> out, and I must [...] lock myself up, or other people will do it for me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{responsible}} to my owners," [...] said Brisket. [...] "Have you any fault <b>to</b> <b>find</b> with <b>me,</b> gentlemen?" [...] he demanded, turning on {{them with a}} frown.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{know what}} fault you've got <b>to</b> <b>find</b> wi' <b>me,</b> Mr. Tulliver," [...] said Mr. Moss, deprecatingly; [...] "I know there isn't a day-laborer works harder." ...|$|R
500|$|No {{lingering}} {{about was}} allowed, no gossiping {{with the other}} actors; the women’s dressing-rooms were {{on one side of}} the stage, the men's on the other, and when we were not actually playing we had to mount at once our respective narrow staircases– sheep rigorously separated from the goats! [...] Once, when my mother came to see me in London, expecting <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>me</b> dwelling in haunts of gilded luxury, and far down the road to perdition, I took her behind the scenes and showed her the arrangements for the actors and actresses, conventual in their austerity. ... I think there never was a theatre run on lines of such strict propriety; no breath of scandal ever touched it in all the twenty years of my experience. [...] Gilbert would suffer no loose word or gesture either behind the stage or on it, and watched over us young women like a dragon.|$|E
500|$|Matt Hills and Rebecca Williams also {{discuss the}} {{treatment}} of Cordelia (and Darla) in [...] "Angels Monstrous Mothers and Vampires with Soul: Investigating the Abject in 'Television Horror'", from [...] by Stacey Abbot. They see the send-offs of Cordelia, Fred and other characters {{as part of a}} pattern of highly gendered [...] "elaborated abjection" [...] seen in Angel. They also see Cordelia's possession in season four as part of a recurring pattern: [...] "More so than other characters in [...] and Angel, Cordelia has suffered or been threatened with bodily invasion and rape, either symbolically or literally" [...] and recounts the demon impregnation in [...] "Expecting", and similarly in [...] "Epiphany", where she develops a gestating demon in her head and then told she must mate with the Groosalugg in [...] "Through the Looking Glass". Cordelia even remarks on this, as Hills and Williams quote her as she remarks on her [...] "status as a violated and devalued character"; Cordelia states, [...] "If you ever {{figure out how to get}} us out of here, I want you <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>me</b> a dimension where some demon doesn't want to impregnate me with his spawn!" [...] They liken the horror motif in these examples, and in [...] "Inside Out", to what Barbara Creed called the 'monstrous womb' in her book The Monstrous-feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis. Jes Battis also comments how, in comparison with the Fred-Illyria season five storyline, Cordelia's storyline is not as positive as Fred's rebirth, because Fred got to [...] "'live on' through Illyria, whereas Cordelia is taken right out of the show and receives no interesting blue-haired reincarnation". Continuing, they say that in fact, there is no meaningful connection between the [...] "real" [...] Cordelia and Jasmine, as the Cordelia who did those bad things is killed the moment Jasmine is, [...] "and the 'true' Cordy wakes up from her coma". Further illustrating the comparisons, [...] "Fred/Illyria become a joined mother/daughter subjectivity, a dual being whose constituent essences are inseparable; Cordelia is never so intimately connected with her evil child and is remembered as the healthy, vibrant Cordy that everyone knew." [...] Pointing out symbolic parallels in the subtexts of these gestations, Battis notes Cordelia, a vocal advocate of her own privilege, creates a fully formed supernatural being, Jasmine, who attempts (shockingly) to control the world. Fred, on the other hand, who internalizes her own privilege and cannot express it except in terms of insecurity and awkwardness, has her body devoured from the inside by the demon Illyria.|$|E
2500|$|According to Loveless, [...] "...I {{learned so}} much about what to feel in a song from those years of playing those clubs. I was saddened {{sometimes}} because I thought 'I left Nashville, I left all that for this? What happened to me? What is wrong with me?' But I think what was happening was that I was beginning <b>to</b> <b>find...</b> <b>me.</b> Find who I really was. And {{what kind of person}} I was inside and out. I still believe to this day it happened the way it was supposed to happen.|$|E

6000|$|... "Though, unfortunately, rather lazy. I {{intend to}} allow Rachel to {{be a fool}} if she wants <b>to,</b> and--Do you <b>find</b> <b>me</b> on the whole {{satisfactory}} in other respects?" [...] he asked shyly.|$|R
2500|$|In an interview, Dappy {{described}} the song as being [...] "up-tempo, fast, party music" [...] {{as well as}} being [...] "Up-to-date and about Facebook and stuff." [...] The song lyrics follow a theme of infatuation and disappointment with each member describing their own personal experience of how they met someone they thought was 'The one' and how the person left before {{they were able to get}} the phone number. References by Dappy include how he searched on Facebook for the woman he never got a phone number from. Tulisa's story includes how she wore a [...] "LBD" [...] and [...] "Bang bang shoes" [...] when leaving her date for a moment to go to the ladies bathroom at a club and on return discovering he left her without his phone number. Despite the lyric in the song referring to searching for someone you are in love with on Facebook, in an interview with Hollyoaks, Dappy said that that is not something he does: If I want to get in touch with someone, I'll just ring them, man. A lot of girls might be trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>me</b> on Facebook, but they won't. They'll find a fake one.|$|E
60|$|She looked swiftly around, and I fancied {{that it was}} {{a relief}} to her <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>me</b> alone.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} {{he caught sight}} of me, and came up, pleased <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>me,</b> but vexed with me for having got lost.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] replies {{the mother}} {{to such a}} request, [...] "I'll tell you a story; but I must have a picture <b>to</b> my story. <b>Find</b> <b>me</b> a picture in some book." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{helped me}} more than {{anything}} else because it showed my face. After it was aired, people wanted <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out about <b>me</b> and use me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm as {{nervous as}} I can be," [...] she confessed. [...] "Mr. Heepman will be {{watching}} all the night for something <b>to</b> <b>find</b> fault with <b>me</b> about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see, sir, {{that you}} {{recognize}} me, and I suppose you are somewhat surprised <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>me</b> here, and thus," [...] glancing at her dress.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{a little}} silver one like {{the key of}} my piano, or the black cabinet. She woke and was very angry <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>me</b> meddling." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, I {{have thought}} of one other,' said she. 'It is that if ever you had <b>to</b> <b>find</b> fault with <b>me</b> about anything, it should be when we are alone.' ...|$|R
60|$|My one {{hope was}} that Isaline might {{possibly}} be surprised at my delay in returning, and might send {{out one of the}} guides <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... “He wants <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{out about}} <b>me,</b> {{and he thinks}} they may tell him something. Some day he’ll ask you right out ‘What sort of a woman is she anyway?’” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] she declared. [...] "You are {{not going}} to pretend, then, that you don't know? That is excellent. Julien, tell me at once where <b>to</b> <b>find</b> her. Take <b>me</b> <b>to</b> her." ...|$|R

60|$|MINNIE. Cut it out, George! (Glancing around apprehensively.) Say, if {{your mother}} was <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>me</b> here she'd want to send me up to the {{reformatory}} (she frees herself).|$|E
6000|$|Hallam, who {{had been}} {{watching}} him, nodded reflectively. [...] "I guess you didn't expect <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>me,</b> or you wouldn't have come," [...] he said. [...] "Where were you going?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cryptic, {{but with}} quite a nice sort of sound about it," [...] she observed, smiling. [...] "Tell me honestly, though, aren't you {{surprised}} <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>me</b> living here quite alone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Giuseppi," [...] he said, as he {{took his}} place in the boat, [...] "I want you <b>to</b> <b>find</b> for <b>me,</b> for service tonight, a gondolier who is a native of Chioggia, and who knows every foot of the country round, and every winding of the canals.
