To {{investigate}} the mechanism underlying this behavior, we characterized the sodium current and {{a subset of}} the potassium currents in the cells in voltage-clamp experiments. We found that there is a persistent component of the sodium current in DA cells which activates at more depolarized potentials than the <b>transient</b> <b>component</b> of the current. The <b>transient</b> <b>component</b> was completely inactivated at − 50 mV, but DA cells remained able to fire spontaneous action potentials when potassium channels were partially blocked and the membrane potential remained above − 40 mV. Based on these electrophysiological data, we developed a reduced computer model that reproduced the major features of DA cells. In simulations at the physiological resting potential, the persistent component of the sodium current was both necessary and sufficient to account for spontaneous activity, and the major contribution of the <b>transient</b> <b>component</b> of the sodium current was to initiate the depolarization of the model cell during the interspike interval.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} a robust adaptive Lomb periodogram (RALP) for time-frequency (TF) analysis of time series with sinusoidal and <b>transient</b> <b>components,</b> which are possibly non-uniformly sampled. It extends the conventional Lomb spectrum by windowing the observation data and adaptively selects the window lengths by {{the intersection of}} confidence intervals (ICI) rule. The influence of <b>transient</b> <b>components</b> to conventional time-frequency representation can be moderated using M-estimation of robust statistics. Instead of treating the <b>transient</b> <b>components</b> as impulsive noise and removing them, the proposed RALP TF distribution yields separately a time domain representation of the <b>transient</b> <b>components</b> and a conventional TF representation of the sinusoidal components, which greatly improves the visualization and detection of these components.

40|$|Pulsars show {{two classes}} of {{rotational}} irregularities {{that can be used}} to understand neutron-star interiors and magnetospheres: glitches and timing noise. Here we present an analysis of the Vela pulsar spanning nearly 21 yr of observation and including 8 glitches. We identify the relative pulse number of all of the observations between glitches, with the only pulse-number ambiguities existing over glitch events. We use the phase coherence of the timing solution to simultaneously model the timing noise and glitches in a Bayesian framework, allowing us to select preferred models for both. We find the glitches can be described using only permanent and transient changes in spin frequency, i. e., no step changes in frequency derivative. For all of the glitches, we only need two exponentially decaying changes in spin frequency to model the <b>transient</b> <b>components.</b> In contrast to previous studies, we find that the dominant <b>transient</b> <b>components</b> decay on a common ≈ 1300 d time scale, and that a larger fraction (≳ 25 %) of glitch amplitudes are associated with these <b>transient</b> <b>components.</b> We also detect shorter-duration <b>transient</b> <b>components</b> of ≈ 25 d, as previously observed, but are limited in sensitivity to events with shorter durations by the cadence of our observations.

40|$|Background. Adaptation {{models of}} the {{horizontal}} disparity vergence system assume a non-adaptable <b>transient</b> <b>component.</b> They also predict identical post-adaptation dynamics during convergence and divergence movements. Method. To test the adaptation property of the <b>transient</b> <b>component,</b> a set of experiments are performed in which closed-loop vergence dynamics measured before and after sustained convergence are compared, primarily by comparing the peak vergence velocity, occurrence time of peak vergence velocity and steady-state vergence posture. Vergence dynamics after durations of 30, 60 and 90 secs of sustained convergence are compared to those after a control duration of 5 sec. Results. The peak divergence velocity is reduced by about 25 % within 30 secs of sustained vergence. However, the peak convergence velocity is unchanged for all the exposure durations. Additionally, for all durations, the peak divergence velocity is significantly higher than peak convergence velocity. In contrast to peak velocities, the occurrence time of peak convergence and divergence velocity {{did not differ significantly}} and remained unchanged for all durations. Conclusions. It is shown that the <b>transient</b> <b>component</b> is adaptable.

Pressurized arteriolar segments (internal diameter: 175 +/- 2 microm) developed spontaneous tone (90 +/- 2 microm). Application of acetylcholine (0. 1 and 0. 3 microM) {{resulted in a}} transient dilation followed by a steady-state dilatory response. In the presence of N(G) -nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) approximately 70 % of the transient dilation was resistant to nitric oxide inhibition, whereas the steady-state response was abolished. Further experiments using 0. 1 microM acetylcholine (no L-NNA present) were aimed to inhibit synthesis or action of the mediator of the <b>transient</b> <b>component</b> (amplitude: 39 +/- 2. 8 microm). A high-potassium buffer (30 - 50 mM) abolished this transient dilation (1. 3 +/- 1. 3 microm), suggesting that the dilation is mediated by an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). This putative EDHF-mediated dilation is strongly reduced by cytochrome P- 450 inhibitors miconazole (11 +/- 1. 3 microm) and SKF- 525 a (4. 8 +/- 4. 5 microm). The <b>transient</b> <b>component</b> is inhibited by tetraethylammonium but not by glibenclamide, indicating it is mediated by opening of Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an approach for decomposing a signal into {{the sum of}} an oscillatory component and a <b>transient</b> <b>component.</b> The method uses a newly developed rational-dilation wavelet transform (WT), a selfinverting constant-Q transform with an adjustable Q-factor (quality-factor). We propose that the oscillatory component be modeled as signal that can be sparsely represented using a high Q-factor WT; likewise, we propose that the <b>transient</b> <b>component</b> be modeled as a piecewise smooth signal that can be sparsely represented using a low Q-factor WT. Because the low and high Q-factor wavelet transforms are highly distinct (having low coherence), morphological component analysis (MCA) successfully yields the desired decomposition of a signal into an oscillatory and non-oscillatory component. The method, being non-linear, is not constrained by the limits of conventional LTI filtering. Keywords: wavelets, sparsity, morphological component analysis, constant Q, Q-factor 1...|$|E
40|$|At {{conventional}} synapses, {{invasion of}} an action potential into the presynaptic terminal produces a rapid Ca 2 + influx and ultimately the release of synaptic vesicles. However, retinal rod bipolar cells (RBCs) generally do not produce action potentials, {{and the rate of}} depolarization of the axon terminal is instead governed by the rate of rise of the light response, which can be quite slow. Using paired whole-cell recordings, we measured the behaviour of the RBC-AII amacrine cell synapse while simulating light-induced depolarizations either by slowly ramping the RBC voltage or by depolarizing the RBC with the mGluR 6 receptor antagonist (R,S) -α-cyclopropyl- 4 -phosphonophenylglycine (CPPG). Both voltage ramps and CPPG evoked slow activation of presynaptic Ca 2 + currents and severely attenuated the early, <b>transient</b> <b>component</b> of the AII EPSC compared with voltage steps. We also found that the duration of the <b>transient</b> <b>component</b> was limited in time, and this limitation could not be explained by vesicle depletion, inhibitory feedback, or proton inhibition. Limiting the duration of the fast transient insures the availability of readily releasable vesicles to support a second, sustained component of release. The mGluR 6 pathway modulator cGMP sped the rate of RBC depolarization in response to puffs of CPPG and consequently potentiated the <b>transient</b> <b>component</b> of the EPSC {{at the expense of the}} sustained component. We conclude that the rod bipolar cell is capable of both transient and sustained signalling, and modulation of the mGluR 6 pathway by cGMP allows the RBC to switch between these two time courses of transmitter release...|$|E

Adenosine, but not adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP), dose-dependently and reversibly inhibited the <b>transient</b> <b>component</b> of the whole-terminal Ba 2 + currents, with an IC 50 of 0. 875 μm. Adenosine strongly inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner (IC 50 = 2. 67 μm), depolarization-triggered AVP and OT release from isolated NH terminals. Adenosine and the N-type Ca 2 + channel blocker ω-conotoxin GVIA, but not other Ca 2 + channel-type antagonists, inhibited the same <b>transient</b> <b>component</b> of the Ba 2 + current. Other components such as the L-, Q- and R-type channels, however, were insensitive to adenosine. Similarly, only adenosine and ω-conotoxin GVIA were able to inhibit the same component of AVP release. A 1 receptor agonists, but not other purinoceptor-type agonists, inhibited the same <b>transient</b> <b>component</b> of the Ba 2 + current as adenosine. Furthermore, the A 1 receptor antagonist 8 -cyclopentyltheophylline (CPT), but not the A 2 receptor antagonist 3, 7 -dimethyl- 1 -propargylxanthine (DMPGX), reversed inhibition of this current component by adenosine. The inhibition of AVP and OT release also appeared to be via the A 1 receptor, since it was reversed by CPT. We therefore conclude that adenosine, acting via A 1 receptors, specifically blocks the terminal N-type Ca 2 + channel thus leading to inhibition of the release of both AVP and OT...|$|E
