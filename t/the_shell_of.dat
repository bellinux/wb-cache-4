5|$|Prior to 1900, the {{similarity}} in shape of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> Amphidromus {{to that of}} South American tree snails in the family Bulimulidae had misled taxonomists. However, the dissections made by Wiegmann and Jacobi clearly showed that the inner anatomical features of Amphidromus {{were the same as}} those of the Asian-Indonesian Camaenidae, and that the resemblance of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> Amphidromus to that of bulimulids was merely an example of parallelism.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the hotel}} was {{occupied}} by Japanese troops, and the Japanese flag was flown above the walls for {{the entirety of the}} war. During the Battle for the Liberation of Manila, {{the hotel was}} set on fire by the Japanese. <b>The</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> the building survived the blaze and the structure was later reconstructed.|$|E
5|$|In {{shells of}} most of the species in the {{subgenus}} Amphidromus, resting stages are marked by the deposition of a brown or black radial band called a varix. This appears to be rare in the subgenus Syndromus, although <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> A. laevus does show evidence of interruption of the spiral banding after a resting phase.|$|E

50|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} can {{be observed}} in <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> this species: <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> males tend to be more elongate with a smoother outer surface, whereas <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> females are generally wider and more nodulose. The angle of the spire also differs between males and females.|$|R
5000|$|As well as {{sea snail}} shells, shell jewelry also {{sometimes}} uses <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> clams (bivalves) and tusk shells (scaphopods). Occasionally shell jewelry {{is made from}} <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> non-marine mollusks such as <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> land snails http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/274/1627/2907.full, or <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> freshwater mollusks. Not all shell jewelry is made from whole shells; some kinds are made from parts <b>of</b> <b>shells,</b> including <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> layer known as mother of pearl or nacre, and the [...] "trapdoor" [...] or operculum {{which is part of}} some sea snails.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> Theodoxus fluviatilis is {{somewhat}} depressed (with an usually low spire), strongly calcified, and has 3–3.5 whorls (including the protoconch). Larger specimens are usually eroded. The width {{of an adult}} shell is usually 5–9mm, but can reach up to 11–13mm. The height of the shell is 4–6.5mm, or up to 7mm. These mean values vary among populations depending on the environment: the maximum width of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> brackish water populations is 9.3mm. Brackish water shells are somewhat shorter, reaching up to 5.8mm, and the maximum weight of the shell is 124mg. In freshwater populations, the maximum recorded shell width is 13.1mm, and maximum height is 9.3mm. The maximum weight of freshwater shells is 343mg.|$|E
5|$|Both sides cite strong evidence, and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} be resolved. <b>The</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> testudines distinguishes them from other vertebrates. The shell is not an exoskeleton, but a modified ribcage and part of the vertebral column. Because of the shell, the pectoral and pelvic girdles are located within the ribcage. The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to the shell.|$|E
5|$|The first {{published}} depictions of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> this species appeared in 1681 {{in the earliest}} book solely about sea shells, Recreatio mentis et oculi in observatione animalium testaceorum (Refreshment {{of the mind and}} the eye in the observation of shell-bearing animals) by Italian scholar Filippo Buonanni. The species was shown in the 1742 Index Testarum Conchyliorum, quae adservantur in Museo Nicolai Gualtieri (List of the shells of shellfish which are preserved in the museum of Niccolò Gualtieri) by Italian physician and malacologist Niccolò Gualtieri. In both books, the morphology of an adult shell was shown from different perspectives.|$|E
50|$|Lirae (singular lira) {{are fine}} lines or ridges (much finer than ribs) {{that are a}} sculptural feature of <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> various animals. <b>The</b> term is {{commonly}} applied to <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> molluscs such as gastropods, bivalves and nautiloids. It {{can also be used}} to describe similar sculpture on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> brachiopods.|$|R
5000|$|Juvenile cowry shells {{are not at}} all {{similar to}} adult cowry <b>shells.</b> <b>The</b> {{juvenile}} <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> cowries perhaps more closely resemble <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> some [...] "bubble snails" [...] in the order Cephalaspidea. Also <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> juvenile cowries seldom exhibit the same color patterns as <b>the</b> adult <b>shells</b> do, and thus can be hard to identify to species.|$|R
50|$|The genera Provanna and Desbruyeresia have {{smaller and}} slender <b>shells,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> Alviniconcha and Ifremeria are larger and swollen. <b>The</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> these two last genera house a hypertrophied ctenidium large {{quantities}} of symbiotic bacteria.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is ovate, slender, acute, and of {{moderate}} thickness. The shell suture is deep. The spire is gently convex, laterally compressed, with 3¼ whorls. The spire is long, {{slightly less than}} half the shell length, and the aperture is very oblique. The shell color is subtranslucent, calcareous pale yellow to white. The surface is somewhat glossy and marked with growth wrinkles and lines. The size varies somewhat, but adult specimens of the type lot averaged 20.9millimeters (mm) in shell length. Various adult specimens measured during the summer of 1981 and 1982 ranged from 19 to 24mm.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> {{the object}} is so hard that even a boron nitride drill makes no impression, and when the attempt is made, {{vibrations}} cause severe distress in people around the object. Quatermass interviews local residents and discovers ghosts and poltergeists have been common {{in the area for}} decades. A hysterical soldier is carried out of the object, claiming to have seen a dwarf-like apparition walk through the wall of the artefact, a description that matches a 1927 newspaper account of a ghost.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the more}} unusual {{relationships}} are those between certain anemones (such as Adamsia, Calliactis and Neoaiptasia) and hermit crabs or snails, and Bundeopsis or Triactis anemones and Lybia boxing crabs. In the former, the anemones live on <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> the hermit crab or snail. In the latter, the small anemones are carried in the claws of the boxing crab.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> Nannamoria {{have a small}} blunt protoconch, {{their overall}} shape varies but most species have a {{shoulder}} with nodules or spines. The base colour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> Nannamoria is white, and they are overlaid with brown axial lines.|$|R
5000|$|A plait is an {{anatomical}} feature {{which is}} present <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> some snails, or gastropods.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> sea snails {{are often}} found by humans as seashells {{commonly}} wash up on beaches.

5|$|A third {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1868 {{at a cost of}} £50,000, within <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> the old theatre, for Lord Dudley. It was designed by Charles Lee and Sons and their partner, William Pain. They had taken over John Nash's practice on his retirement. The new theatre was designed to be less susceptible to fire, with brick firewalls, iron roof trusses and Dennett's patent gypsum-cement floors. The auditorium had four tiers, with a stage large enough for the greatest spectaculars. For opera, the theatre seated 1,890, and for plays, with the orchestra pit removed, 2,500. As a result of a dispute over the rent between Dudley and Mapleson, and a decline in the popularity of ballet, the theatre remained dark until 1874, when it was sold to a Revivalist Christian group for £31,000.|$|E
5|$|At a temple, which Meera visits as {{her daily}} ritual, Zeenat makes her first contact. Zeenat is {{too afraid to}} tell Meera {{the truth about the}} situation, and she does not reveal who she is or why she has come. Over a few weeks, they become good friends and spend most of the time together. Their {{friendship}} brings out the missing part in each of their personalities. In the process, Zeenat realizes helplessness; this is totally new to her forthright way of thinking. Meera, on the other hand, gets a glimpse of freedom; this brings her out of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> the traditions in her haveli and gives her a new perspective on her life.|$|E
5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} (commonly {{known as}} the dog conch or by its better-known synonym, Strombus canarium) is a species of edible sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Strombidae (true conches). Known from illustrations in books dating from the late 17th century, L.canarium is an Indo-Pacific species occurring from India and Sri Lanka to Melanesia, Australia and southern Japan. <b>The</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> adult individuals is coloured from light yellowish-brown to golden to grey. It has a characteristic inflated body whorl, a flared, thick outer lip and a shallow stromboid notch. The shell is valued as an ornament, {{and because it is}} heavy and compact it is also often used as a sinker for fishing nets.|$|E
50|$|A callus {{exists in}} <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> various species of {{gastropods}} (snails) {{and also in}} <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> several species of Nautilus, a cephalopod.A callum is an anatomical feature of some mature bivalve <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> species in <b>the</b> family Pholadidae, the piddocks.

5|$|Logarithms {{have many}} {{applications}} {{inside and outside}} mathematics. Some of these occurrences {{are related to the}} notion of scale invariance. For example, each chamber of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> a nautilus is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor. This gives rise to a logarithmic spiral. Benford's law on the distribution of leading digits can also be explained by scale invariance. Logarithms are also linked to self-similarity. For example, logarithms appear in the analysis of algorithms that solve a problem by dividing it into two similar smaller problems and patching their solutions. The dimensions of self-similar geometric shapes, that is, shapes whose parts resemble the overall picture are also based on logarithms.|$|E
5|$|Plastromancy: The {{earliest}} use of turtle shells {{comes from}} the archaeological site in Jiahu site. The shells, containing small pebbles of various size, colour and quantity, were drilled with small holes, suggesting that each pair of them was tied together originally. Similar finds have also {{been found in the}} Dawenkou burial sites of about 4000–3000 BC, as well as in Henan, Sichuan, Jiangsu and Shaanxi. The turtle-shell shakers for the most part are made of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> land turtles, identified as Cuora flavomarginata. Archaeologists believe that these shells were used either as rattles in ceremonial dances, shamantic healing tools or ritual paraphernalia for divinational purposes.|$|E
5|$|The guns {{proved to}} be too {{powerful}} for Furious light hull, and they became available for other uses during 1917, after trials showed the ship could not handle the stress of firing. Admiral Sir Reginald Bacon, commander of the Dover Patrol, conceived a plan to mount two guns inside <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> the Palace Hotel in Westende from where they could bombard the naval facilities at Zeebrugge and Bruges, provided that the hotel was captured during the upcoming Battle of Passchendaele. He planned to transport the guns across the English Channel lashed to the torpedo bulges of monitors. He also thought {{that they could be}} used on the decks of monitors and as such a dual purpose carriage was designed for the guns, which could be used both afloat and ashore. Only a limited amount of traverse was required for either role, but elevation had to be increased to 45° to maximize range. The concept was approved 23 September 1917, and Elswick was ordered to design the new 'B CD' mounts for delivery in five months.|$|E

5|$|Four {{other churches}} are {{associated}} with this tradition: St John the Baptist's Church, Chester, Old St. Paul's Cathedral, London, Bath Abbey and the destroyed Benedictine Abbey of Coventry. The collegiate church of St John in Chester was raised to cathedral status in 1075, but became a co-cathedral in 1102, when the see was removed to Coventry. The current building was probably begun {{around the time of}} the see's removal. St. Paul’s, a cathedral with a secular chapter, was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and was replaced by the present cathedral in the Baroque style designed by Christopher Wren. Bath Abbey was co-cathedral of the Diocese of Bath and Wells, along with Wells Cathedral. Although a large church, architecturally it does not fit the cathedral tradition, but has much in common with King’s College Chapel, Cambridge and St. George’s Chapel, Windsor. The abbey church at Coventry, was co-cathedral with Lichfield and St John Chester in the Diocese of Lichfield, but was destroyed at the Dissolution. The large parish church of St. Michael’s, Coventry, became Coventry Cathedral in 1918. It was bombed during World War II, leaving intact only its spire, regarded as one of the finest in England. The new Coventry Cathedral designed by Sir Basil Spence was consecrated in 1962 and adjoins <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> the ancient church.|$|E
5|$|Located {{close to}} Polaris is Lambda Ursae Minoris, a red giant of {{spectral}} type M1III. It is a semiregular variable varying from magnitudes 6.35 to 6.45. The northerly {{nature of the}} constellation means that the variable stars can be observed all year: the red giant R Ursae Minoris is a semiregular variable varying from magnitude 8.5 to 11.5 over 328days, while S Ursae Minoris is a long period variable that ranges between magnitudes 8.0 and 11 over 331days. Located south of Kochab and Pherkad towards Draco is RR Ursae Minoris, a red giant of spectral type M5III that is also a semiregular variable ranging from magnitude 4.44 to 4.85 {{over a period of}} 43.3days. T Ursae Minoris is another red giant variable star that has undergone a dramatic change in status—from being a long period (Mira) variable ranging from magnitude 7.8 to 15 over 310–315 days to a semiregular variable. The star is thought to have undergone a shell helium flash—a point where <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> helium around the star's core reaches a critical mass and ignites—marked by its abrupt change in variability in 1979. Z Ursae Minoris is a faint variable star that suddenly dropped 6magnitudes in 1992 and was identified as one of a rare class of stars—R Coronae Borealis variables.|$|E
5|$|Mr Knight of Cannington {{alerted the}} nuns {{to the sale}} of Taunton Lodge, and they raised the £3,150 {{required}} to purchase it. They completed the purchase in early May 1807, after some minor quibbles with the Coles family. When the abbess visited the Lodge prior to the purchase, she had identified that it would require £1,000 worth of improvements {{in addition to the}} money already spent on its acquisition. The plans included extending the existing building to gain a staircase and some dormitories for the school girls, and the addition of a new wing that would include a chapel, infirmary, four cells, and rooms for the male chaplain and servants. The new building was begun in March 1808, and by June of that year, the entire community had moved from Winchester, despite the work being ongoing. <b>The</b> <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> the new body was completed by the autumn of 1808, but the work was delayed {{due to a lack of}} finances as £1,908 had already been spent on altering the old building. This cost did not include the erection of the new wing, thus the constructions costs were already far surpassing the original estimate.|$|E
