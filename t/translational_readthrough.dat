The human genome encodes a few genes, whose mRNA stop codon are surprisingly leaky: In these genes, termination of translation is inefficient due to special RNA bases in the vicinity of the stop codon.

Here, we leverage comparative genomic evidence across 21 Anopheles mosquitoes to systematically annotate readthrough genes in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, and to provide the first study of abundant readthrough evolution, by comparison with 20 Drosophila species. Using improved comparative genomics methods for detecting readthrough, we identify evolutionary signatures of conserved, functional readthrough of 353 stop codons in the malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, and of 51 additional Drosophila melanogaster stop codons, including several cases of double and triple readthrough and of readthrough of two adjacent stop codons. We find that most differences between the readthrough repertoires of the two species arose from readthrough gain or loss in existing genes, rather than birth of new genes or gene death; that readthrough-associated RNA structures are sometimes gained or lost while readthrough persists; that readthrough {{is more likely to}} be lost at TAA and TAG stop codons; and that readthrough is under continued purifying evolutionary selection in mosquito, based on population genetic evidence. We also determine readthrough-associated gene properties that predate readthrough, and identify differences in the characteristic properties of readthrough genes between clades.

There have been some reports of <b>translational</b> <b>readthrough</b> of such premature stop codons in mammals, as reviewed in the [...] "Translational readthrough" [...] section of the stop codon article. As alluded to in the figure above, a small amount of the protein product of such readthrough may still be recognizable and function at some level.

SMA is caused by loss or mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 gene, SMN 1, with retention of a nearly identical copy gene, SMN 2. In contrast to SMN 1, most SMN 2 transcripts lack exon 7. This alternatively spliced transcript, Î” 7 -SMN, encodes a truncated protein that is rapidly degraded. Inhibiting this degradation may be of therapeutic value for the treatment of SMA. Recently aminoglycosides, which decrease translational fidelity to promote readthrough of termination codons, were shown to increase SMN levels in patient cell lines. Amid uncertainty concerning the role of SMN's C-terminus, the potential of <b>translational</b> <b>readthrough</b> as a therapeutic mechanism for SMA is unclear. Here, we used stable cell lines to demonstrate the SMN C-terminus modulates protein stability in a sequence-independent manner that is reproducible by <b>translational</b> <b>readthrough.</b> Geneticin (G 418) was then identified as a potent inducer of the Î” 7 -SMN target sequence in vitro through a novel quantitative assay amenable to high throughput screens.

Furthermore, treatment of SMA mice with G 418 increased both SMN protein and mouse motor function.

The UGA codon and its neighboring nucleotide sequences were subcloned into a heterologous coding context, and readthrough efficiency was measured by cell-free translation of RNA transcripts in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The CUA codon immediately downstream of the UGA codon {{was found to be}} sufficient for efficient <b>translational</b> <b>readthrough.</b> Further mutagenesis of residues in the CUA triplet demonstrated that mutations at the second or third residues following the UGA codon (U and A, respectively) had little effect on readthrough efficiency. In contrast, replacement of the cytidine residue immediately downstream of the UGA codon with any of the other three nucleotides (U, A, or G) dramatically reduced the readthrough efficiency from approximately 10 % to less than 1 %. These results show that a simple sequence context can allow efficient readthrough of UGA codons in a mammalian translation system. Interestingly, compilation studies of nucleotide sequences surrounding eukaryotic termination codons indicate a strong bias against cytidine residues immediately 3 ' to UGA termination codons.

40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{mechanisms}} mediating longevities of mRNAs. As a means of identifying potential cis- and trans-acting elements which stabilize an individual mRNA, naturally occurring mutations that decreased stability of the normally long-lived globin mRNA were analyzed. Our previous studies demonstrated that a subset of mutations which allowed the translating ribosome to read through into the alpha 2 -globin 3 ' nontranslated region (NTR) targeted the mutant mRNAs for accelerated turnover in erythroid cells but not in several nonerythroid cell lines (I. M. Weiss and S. A. Liebhaber, Mol. Cell. Biol. 14 : 8123 - 8132, 1994). These results suggested that <b>translational</b> <b>readthrough</b> interfered with some feature of the alpha 2 -globin 3 ' NTR required for message stability in erythroid cells. To define the cis-acting sequences which comprise this erythroid cell-specific stability determinant, scanning mutagenesis was performed on the alpha 2 -globin 3 ' NTR, and the stability of each mutant mRNA was examined during transient expression. Three cytidine-rich regions which are required for longevity of the alpha 2 -globin mRNA were identified. However, in contrast to the readthrough mutations, base substitutions in these elements destabilize the message through a translation-independent mechanism. To account for these results, we propose that the cis-acting elements form a complex or determinant in the normal alpha 2 -globin mRNA which protects the message from degradation in erythroid cells. Disruption of this determinant, by <b>translational</b> <b>readthrough</b> or because mutations in an element prevent or inhibit its formation, targets the message for accelerated turnover in these cells...|$|E

We developed a <b>translational</b> <b>readthrough</b> assay for selenoprotein biosynthesis by using the gene for luciferase as a reporter. Insertion of a UGA or UAA codon into the coding region of luciferase abolished luciferase activity. However, activity was restored to the UGA mutant, {{but not to the}} UAA mutant, upon insertion of the PhGPx 3 ' UTR.

UV cross-linking studies identified a 120 -kDa protein in rat testis that binds specifically to the sense strands of the PhGPx and GPx 3 ' UTRs. Direct cross-linking and competition experiments with deletion mutant RNAs demonstrated that binding of the 120 -kDa protein requires the AUGA SECIS element but not AAAAC.

40|$|<b>Translational</b> <b>readthrough</b> of stop codons by ribosomes is a recoding event used by {{a variety}} of viruses, {{including}} plus-strand RNA tombusviruses. Translation of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in tombusviruses is mediated using this strategy and we have investigated this process using a variety of in vitro and in vivo approaches. Our results indicate that readthrough generating the RdRp requires a novel long-range RNA-RNA interaction, spanning a distance of âˆ¼ 3. 5 kb, which occurs between a large RNA stem-loop located 3 '-proximal to the stop codon and an RNA replication structure termed RIV at the 3 '-end of the viral genome. Interestingly, this long-distance RNA-RNA interaction is modulated by mutually-exclusive RNA structures in RIV that represent a type of RNA switch. Moreover, a different long-range RNA-RNA interaction that was previously shown to be necessary for viral RNA replicase assembly was also required for efficient readthrough production of the RdRp. Accordingly, multiple replication-associated RNA elements are involved in modulating the readthrough event in tombusviruses and we propose an integrated mechanistic model to describe how this regulatory network could be advantageous by (i) providing a quality control system for culling truncated viral genomes at an early stage in the replication process, (ii) mediating cis-preferential replication of viral genomes, and (iii) coordinating <b>translational</b> <b>readthrough</b> of the RdRp with viral genome replication.

It is unclear how the Tca 2 gag UGA codon is bypassed to allow pol expression. However, in other retroelements, <b>translational</b> <b>readthrough</b> of the gag stop codon can be directed by its flanking sequence, including a 3 ' pseudoknot. RESULTS:The hypothesis was tested that in Tca 2, gag stop codon flanking sequences direct <b>translational</b> <b>readthrough</b> and synthesis of a gag-pol fusion protein. Sequence from the Tca 2 gag-UGA-pol junction (300 nt) was inserted between fused lacZ and luciferase (luc) genes in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae dual reporter construct. Although downstream of UGA, luc was expressed, but its expression was unaffected by inserting additional stop codons at the 3 ' end of lacZ. Luc expression was instead being driven by a previously unknown minor promoter activity within the gag-pol junction region. Evidence together indicated that junction sequence alone cannot direct UGA readthrough. Using reporter genes in C. albicans, the activities of this gag-pol junction promoter and the Tca 2 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter were compared. Of the two promoters, only the LTR promoter was induced by heat-shock, which also triggers retrotransposition. Tca 2 pol protein, epitope-tagged in C. albicans to allow detection, was also heat-shock induced, indicating that pol proteins were expressed from a gag-UGA-pol RNA. CONCLUSION:This is the first demonstration that the LTR promoter directs Tca 2 pol protein expression, and that pol proteins are translated from a gag-pol RNA, which thus requires a mechanism for stop codon bypass. However, in contrast to most other retroelement and viral readthrough signals, immediate gag UGA-flanking sequences were insufficient to direct stop readthrough in S. cerevisiae, indicating non-canonical mechanisms direct gag UGA bypass in Tca 2...|$|E

Sequence from the Tca 2 gag -UGA- pol junction (300 nt) was inserted between fused lacZ and luciferase (luc) genes in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae dual reporter construct. Although downstream of UGA, luc was expressed, but its expression was unaffected by inserting additional stop codons at the 3 ' end of lacZ. Luc expression was instead being driven by a previously unknown minor promoter activity within the gag-pol junction region. Evidence together indicated that junction sequence alone cannot direct UGA readthrough. Using reporter genes in C. albicans, the activities of this gag-pol junction promoter and the Tca 2 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter were compared. Of the two promoters, only the LTR promoter was induced by heat-shock, which also triggers retrotransposition. Tca 2 pol protein, epitope-tagged in C. albicans to allow detection, was also heat-shock induced, indicating that pol proteins were expressed from a gag -UGA- pol RNA. Conclusion This is the first demonstration that the LTR promoter directs Tca 2 pol protein expression, and that pol proteins are translated from a gag - pol RNA, which thus requires a mechanism for stop codon bypass. However, in contrast to most other retroelement and viral readthrough signals, immediate gag UGA-flanking sequences were insufficient to direct stop readthrough in S. cerevisiae, indicating non-canonical mechanisms direct gag UGA bypass in Tca 2. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe plus-strand RNA genome of Tobacco {{necrosis}} virus-D (TNV-D) expresses its polymerase via <b>translational</b> <b>readthrough.</b> The RNA signals {{involved in}} this readthrough process were characterized in vitro using a wheat germ extract translation system and in vivo via protoplast infections. The results indicate that (i) TNV-D requires a long-range RNA-RNA interaction between an extended stem-loop (SL) structure proximal to the readthrough site and a sequence in the 3 '-untranslated region of its genome; (ii) stability of the extended SL structure is important for its function; (iii) TNV-D readthrough elements are compatible with UAG and UGA, but not UAA; (iv) a readthrough defect can be rescued by a heterologous readthrough element in vitro, but not in vivo; and (v) readthrough elements can also mediate translational frameshifting. These results provide new information on determinants of readthrough in TNV-D and further support {{the concept of a}} common general mechanism for readthrough in Tombusviridae...|$|E
40|$|Translational {{regulation}} {{provides an}} efficient means {{to control the}} localization and production of proteins. The headcase (hdc) mRNA in Drosophila generates two overlapping proteins {{as a result of}} <b>translational</b> <b>readthrough</b> of an internal UAA stop codon. This readthrough event is necessary for the function of hdc as a branching inhibitor during tracheal development. By ectopic expression of different Hdc proteins in the trachea, we show that the long Hdc form alone, can function as a potent branching inhibitor whose activity is proportional to its amount. The suppression of termination in the hdc mRNA is not stop-codon dependent, suggesting that the readthrough does not involve codon specific suppressors. We have identified an 80 nucleotide sequence immediately downstream of the UAA, which is necessary and sufficient to confer termination readthrough in a heterologous mRNA. We present a novel mechanism of eukaryotic translational termination suppression that may regulate the amount of functional Hdc...|$|E
40|$|We sequenced two {{recombinant}} DNA clones constituting {{a single}} provirus of the milk-transmitted mouse mammary tumor virus characteristic of BR 6 mice. The complete provirus is 9, 901 base pairs long, flanked by 6 base-pair duplications of cellular DNA {{at the site}} of integration. Five extensive blocks of open reading frame corresponding to the gag gene, the presumed protease, the pol and env genes, and the open reading frame orf within the long terminal repeat of the provirus were readily discernible. Translation of gag, protease, and pol involved three different translational reading frames to produce the three overlapping polyprotein precursors Pr 77, Pr 110, and Pr 160 found in virus-infected cells. Synthesis of the reverse transcriptase and endonuclease therefore required two separate frameshifts to suppress the termination codons at the ends of the Pr 77 and Pr 110 domains. Direct evidence is presented for <b>translational</b> <b>readthrough</b> of both stop codons in an in vitro protein synthesis system...|$|E
40|$|The Upf {{proteins}} {{are essential}} for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). They have also been implicated in the modulation of translational fidelity at viral frameshift signals and premature termination codons. How these factors function in both mRNA turnover and translational control remains unclear. In this study, mono- and bicistronic reporter systems {{were used in the}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae to differentiate between effects at the levels of mRNA turnover and those at the level of translation. We confirm that upfÎ” mutants do not affect programmed frameshifting, and show that this is also true for mutant forms of eIF 1 /Sui 1 p. Further, bicistronic reporters did not detect defects in <b>translational</b> <b>readthrough</b> due to deletion of the UPF genes, suggesting that their function in termination is not as general a phenomenon as was previously believed. The demonstration that upf sui 1 double mutants are synthetically lethal demonstrates an important functional interaction between the NMD and translation initiation pathway...|$|E
