5|$|Other thinkers have {{emphasised}} <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> {{of power}} as a virtue. Some philosophies {{are rooted in the}} love of power because philosophies tend to be coherent unification in <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> of some goal or desire. Just as a philosophy may strive for truth, it may also strive for happiness, virtue, salvation, or, finally, power. Among those philosophies which Russell condemns as rooted in love of power: all forms of idealism and anti-realism, such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte's solipsism; certain forms of Pragmatism; Henri Bergson's doctrine of Creative evolution; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche (Russell 1938:209–214).|$|E
5|$|President and her {{squadron}} {{returned to}} <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> of the Jamaican fleet, and on 1July began {{to follow the}} trail of coconut shells and orange peels the Jamaicans had left behind them.

Rodgers kept up <b>the</b> <b>pursuit,</b> using his bow chasers to severely damage Belvideras rigging, but his two broadsides had little effect. The crew of Belvidera quickly made repairs to the rigging. They cut loose her anchors and boats and pumped drinking water overboard to lighten her load, thereby increasing her speed. Belvidera soon gained enough speed to distance herself from President, and Rodgers abandoned <b>the</b> <b>pursuit.</b> Belvidera sailed to Halifax {{to deliver the}} news that war had been declared.|$|E
