However, as of June 2006, the A12 now follows {{the course of}} the new single {{carriageway}} 40 mph Southern Relief Road that joins the original A12 at Lowestoft bascule bridge.

The presence of these bridge choke points can cause serious disruption to north-south <b>trunk</b> <b>traffic,</b> especially when local traffic is added during rush hours. An adequate bypass for Lowestoft would need to be well to the west, even to the west of Oulton Broad (the body of water), and its route would have to consider the great areas of marshland in that area.

This work studies {{the relation between}} elderly people’s preferences of standard factors in different public transport systems, and their physical capacity. Three public transport systems are focused, service route <b>traffic,</b> <b>trunk</b> route <b>traffic</b> and special transport service, which demand different capacity from the travellers to use. Six quantitative studies were carried out, in which four traveller groups were studied: service route travellers, STS entitled service route travellers, STS travellers and travellers in <b>trunk</b> route <b>traffic.</b> The included standard factors are: walking distance, travel time, headway, transfer, waiting time at transfers, booking, booking time, get seated, vehicle type, travel alone. Results showed that the physical capacity in the traveller groups differed, with STS travellers having least physical capacity. The valuations of the standard factors varied between the groups and the overall pattern was that those with low physical capacity had higher valuations {{for most of the}} factors. Walking distances turned out to be of very large importance for groups with low physical capacity, while avoiding booking was important among those with more physical capacity. Other factors like getting seated before the bus starts, and type of vehicle (for some groups), was also shown to be important. A secondary aim was to study whether the stated preference method conjoint analysis was applicable to study elderly people’s preferences. The overall conclusion is that this is possible, but special considerations must be taken concerning the design of the study. Despite the difficulties, however, knowledge about elderly people preferences gained through conjoint analysis proves to be valuable input in the process of planning a public transport {{that at the same time}} provides good quality to elderly people and is cost-effective for society...|$|R

40|$|Transparent optical {{networking}} promises a cost-efficient solution for future core and metro networks {{because of the}} efficacy of switching high-granularity <b>trunk</b> <b>traffic</b> without opto-electronic conversion. Network availability is an important performance parameter for network operators, who are incorporating protection and restoration mechanisms in the network to achieve competitive advantages. This paper focuses on the reduction in Capital Expenditures (CapEx) expected from implementing sharing of backup resources in path-protected transparent networks. We dimension a nationwide network topology for different protection mechanisms using transparent and opaque architectures. We investigate the CapEx reductions obtained through protection sharing on a population of 1000 randomly generated biconnected planar topologies with 14 nodes. We show that the gain for transparent networks is heavily dependent on the offered load, with almost no relative gain for low load (no required parallel line systems). We also show that for opaque networks the CapEx reduction through protection sharing is independent of the traffic load and shows only a small dependency {{on the number of}} links in the network. The node CapEx reduction for high load (relative to the number of channels in a line system) is comparable to the CapEx reduction in opaque OTN systems. This is rather surprising as in OTN systems the number of transceivers and linecards {{and the size of the}} OTN switching matrix all decrease, while in transparent networks only the degree of the ROADM (number and size of WSSs in the node) decreases while the number of transponders remains the same...|$|E

The dissertation considers, for the case study, two of the Sudan Telecommunication Company pilot projects executed mainly to study the impact of introducing voice over the Internet in the international call trunks. The dissertation addresses the general technical issues in applying VoIP and brief analysis on the performance parameters. The devices implemented, configurations deployed and the connectivity are demonstrated. The designs of the cases with the capacity of resources used are verified. The transported packets are captured and decoded. The carried traffics are analyzed and compared with ordinary <b>trunk</b> <b>traffic.</b> The {{results of this study}} show that the implemented VoIP trunks has carried a total volume of incoming-traffic of 130 % of that carried by the ordinary trunks. The incoming volume of traffic via the ordinary trunks is dropped to 70 % of traffic carried before introducing VoIP trunks. The implemented solution demonstrates that the deployment of VoIP trunk does not need establishment or reconfiguration of the international link, not a big platform change, and not very complicated devices to be used. Delay measurements of VoIP trunk show that the delay is within the recommended range. Statistical analysis of the traffic shows that VoIP has similar daily profile as that of the ordinary voice trunks, which will not affect the current call pricing policy. The traffic load pattern of VoIP has shown that there is always a room for summing up trunks to maximize the circuit utilization. Calculation shows that VoIP trunks obtain better answer-to-seizure ratio and higher average holding-time than that of the ordinary one, thus more paid time than that of the ordinary one is expected. Measurements of IP band width and calculation of the carried traffic volume estimated that if one fourth of the capacity of the current ordinary voice trunks is changed into VoIP trunks, then the traffic volume is expected to be double...|$|E

40|$|Rerouting {{has been}} used in traffic {{management}} to perform dynamic load balancing. The aim of rerouting is to reassign path/bandwidth allocations of current <b>traffic</b> <b>trunks</b> in a network in order to minimize the probability of blocking future resource requests. In this work, we are interested in investigating how the effectiveness of rerouting can be affected by the characteristic of the underlying network topology. In order to evaluate the blocking performance achievable by rerouting, we established baseline measures through two resource allocation algorithms: a shortest distance path algorithm (SDP), that represents the best common practice without rerouting, and a global rerouting algorithm that is based on a provably ɛ-optimal algorithm for multi-commodity flow problem. We proposed two rerouting algorithms based on the basic SDP algorithm that selects for rerouting either from <b>traffic</b> <b>trunks</b> with the same source-destination pairs (local rerouting) or from all <b>traffic</b> <b>trunks</b> (global rerouting). Our results show that the effectiveness of rerouting is highly related to the average node degree. As the connectivity of a graph increases, rerouting tends to be more effective. However, rerouting does not always perform better when connectivity is increased. Significant performance improvement only occurs within a relatively small range of connectivities when a rerouting algorithm like SDP-LR is able to find alternative paths and SDP cannot. Furthermore, local reroutng is sufficient to exploit most of the benefits of rerouting and {{it is not necessary to}} utilize much more computationally intensive global rerouting algorithms. Finally, we investigate the rerouting frequency vs. blocking trade-off and show that for local rerouting, the best performance can be achieved by a rerouting frequency of only 30 %. I...|$|R
