30|$|In {{the present}} work, novel nine terpolymers were {{prepared}} via free radical chain addition polymerization, using (1 : 1 : 1) molar ratio of (jojoba: alkylacrylate: α-olefins) terpolymers. The alkylacrylates used were dodecylacrylate, tetradecylacrylate and hexadecylacrylate while the α-olefins used were dodecene, <b>tetradecene</b> and hexadecane. The prepared terpolymers {{were determined by}} FTIR, 1 H-NMR and GPC for determination of molecular weight. The thermal analyses of the prepared terpolymers were measured using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The prepared additives were evaluated as lube oil viscosity index improvers and pour point depressants.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{organometallic}} {{synthesis of}} ruthenium nanoparticles stabilized by water-soluble alkyl sulfonated diphosphines as ligands is described {{for the first}} time. After isolation, the so-obtained nanoparticles could be easily dispersed into water giving rise to stable aqueous colloidal solutions without precipitation {{over the course of}} several months. The catalytic behaviour of these aqueous colloidal solutions has been investigated in the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates (<b>tetradecene,</b> styrene and acetophenone) in biphasic liquid-liquid conditions, showing interesting results in terms of reactivity. Interestingly, small structural differences in the backbone of the diphosphine ligands influence the catalytic activity of these nanocatalysts. In addition, preliminary tests of recycling showed promising results with neither loss of activity or significant precipitation...|$|E
30|$|In this article, {{with the}} aim of modifying the {{performance}} properties of engine oil, nine terpolymers consisting of (jojoba: alkylacrylate: α-olefins) backbone were synthesized via free radical chain addition polymerization. The alkylacrylates used were (dodecylacrylate, tetradecylacrylate and hexadecylacrylate), while α-olefins used were (dodecene, <b>tetradecene</b> and hexadecane. The monomers’ ratio used for polymerization was (1 : 1 : 1) and they were characterized using FTIR, 1 H-NMR and GPC, for determination of weight average molecular weight. It was found that the viscosity index increases with increasing the alkyl chain length, molecular weight and concentration of used terpolymer. At the same time, the pour point of lube oil decreases (more negative) with decreasing the alkyl chain length of both alkylacrylate and α-olefin used. The thermal stability of the synthesized terpolymers was determined using TGA and DSC. The prepared terpolymers proved its efficiency as lubricating oil additives under severe conditions.|$|E
40|$|In 2 O 3 nanocrystals were {{prepared}} by injection of In 2 O 3 sol {{in a hot}} (160 degrees C) solution of <b>tetradecene</b> and an an-Line. By properly controlling the amine chain length, the processing of the starting Sol and the heat-treatment temperature, In 2 O 3 nanocrystals with a size ranging from 4 to 10 nm were obtained. The nanocrystals suspensions could be easily processed by drop-coating onto alumina substrates to obtain gas-sensing devices. The devices displayed an enormous response to ozone gas, with a response of several orders of magnitude even to 60 ppb of ozone. In particular, the monitoring of low ozone concentrations was possible even by operating at room temperature, where the ozone concentration profile could be rapidly and reversibly monitored. The enhanced gas-sensing properties were explained as the cooperative effect of the nanocrystal size and surface chemistry, characterized by high densities of oxygen vacancies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMetal oxide (SnO 2, TiO 2, In 2 O 3, ZnO) sols are {{prepared}} by various sol-gel processes {{in such a}} way as to hinder the condensation reactions. The obtained sols are injected at 160 °C into a solution of <b>tetradecene</b> and dodecylamine, and kept under heating for different periods of time. Depending on the starting sol, variously crystallized oxide nanoparticles are obtained, whose phase compositions and chemical structure have been studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform IR spectroscopy. The elimination of the organic residuals has been carried out by thermal treatment, and the thermal evolution of the nanoparticles has been studied by thermal analyses and Raman spectroscopy. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy studies coupled with XRD measurements show that the thermal treatment does not markedly affect the particle size, which remains in the nanometer-sized regime (from 3. 5 to 8. 5 nm, depending on the system), except in the case of ZnO.

40|$|Pd-modified SnO 2 nanocrystals, with a Pd/Sn nominal {{atomic ratio}} of 0. 025, were {{prepared}} by injecting SnO 2 sols and a Pd precursor solution into <b>tetradecene</b> and dodecylamine at 160 degrees C. Two different doping procedures were investigated: in co-injection, a Pd acetylacetonate solution in chloroform was {{mixed with the}} SnO 2 sol before the injection; in sequential injection, the Pd solution was injected separately after the SnO 2 sol. The obtained suspensions were heated at the resulting 80 degrees C temperature, then the product was collected by centrifugation and dried at 80 degrees C. When using co-injection, in the dried products PdO and Pd nanoparticles were observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Only SnO 2 nanocrystals were observed in dried products prepared by sequential injection. After heat-treatment at 500 degrees C, no Pd species were observed for both doping procedures. Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that, in both the doping procedures, after heat-treatment Pd is distributed only into the SnO 2 nanocrystal structure. This conclusion was reinforced by the measurement of the electrical properties of Pd-doped nanocrystals, showing a remarkable increase of the electrical resistance if compared with pure SnO 2 nanocrystals. This result was interpreted as Pd insertion as a dopant inside the cassiterite lattice of tin dioxide. The addition of Pd resulted in a remarkable improvement of the gas-sensing properties, allowing the detection of carbon monoxide concentrations below 50 ppm and of very low concentrations (below 25 ppm) of other reducing gases such as ethanol and acetone...|$|E
40|$|The {{reactions}} of gas-phase transition-metal ions with neutral olefins {{are the subject}} of this thesis. Activation of the allylic C-C bonds is observed for {{reactions of}} Fe(2 ̆ 7 +), Ni(2 ̆ 7 +), Co(2 ̆ 7 +) and Cu(2 ̆ 7 +) and alkenes. ^ Upon complexation with Fe(2 ̆ 7 +), olefins ranging from pentene to <b>tetradecene</b> rearrange to a bis(olefin) complex. These rearrangements are general, and are consistent with a mechanism that begins with addition of an allylic C-C bond to the metal ion. This is followed by abstraction of a (beta) -H atom from the resulting alkyl ligand to form a hydrido (pi) -allyl intermediate. Transfer of the H atom to the allylic fragment produces a bis(olefin) complex. ^ The mechanism was verified by examining the structures of the alkene complexes formed by reaction of ionized Fe(CO) (, 5) with olefins in a high-pressure ion source of a tandem mass spectrometer. The structures of the Fe(olefin) (2 ̆ 7 +) adducts were determined by collisionally activating the ion and analyzing the decomposition products. Additional support for the mechanism was obtained by studying the structures of the decomposition products. These studies involved comparisons with reference spectra of the collisionally activated decomposition (CAD) spectra of decomposition products formed either in the ion source by bimolecular reactions or by collisional activation of stable Fe(olefin) (2 ̆ 7 +) adducts, (an MS/MS/MS experiment). ^ Rearrangements of Fe(alkyne) (2 ̆ 7 +) adducts were also investigated. The reaction of Fe(2 ̆ 7 +) and alkynes proceeds via oxidative addition of the propargylic C-C bond. The terminus of the (beta) -H atom was determined to be primarily the third carbon of the propargylic fragment. In contrast, for Fe(alkene) (2 ̆ 7 +) adducts the (beta) -H is transferred primarily to the first carbon of the (pi) -allyl fragment. ^ The use of transition-metal ions as chemical ionization reagents for locating multiple bonds in olefins was explored. For mixture analysis, iron(I) chemical ionization was combined with either tandem mass spectrometry or Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS). Mixtures of isomers and congeners were analyzed by using multicomponent analysis of MS/MS data or by combining capillary gas chromatography and FTMS. ...|$|E
