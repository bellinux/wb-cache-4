50|$|The {{victim was}} {{a witness in}} a {{prosecution}} against <b>the</b> <b>defendant,</b> gave material assistance to the state in any investigation or prosecution of <b>the</b> <b>defendant,</b> or was an eye witness to a crime alleged to have been committed by <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> or possessed other material evidence against <b>the</b> <b>defendant.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{arraignment}} {{is held in}} both misdemeanor and felony cases. At the arraignment, {{the complaint}} or information is read out loud unless <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> waives reading, and in a felony case the district attorney gives <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> {{a copy of the}} information. The court then asks <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> to submit a plea. <b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> may plead “guilty”, “no contest”, “not guilty”, or “{{not guilty by reason of}} mental disease or defect”. A plea of no contest has the same effect in a criminal case as a guilty plea, except it cannot be used as an admission of criminal action in a civil case. <b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> may not enter a plea of no contest without approval from the court. If <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> pleads guilty or no contest, the court sentences <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> or places <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> on probation. If <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> pleads not guilty or not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, the case proceeds to trial.|$|R

5|$|The trial, Illinois vs. August Spies et al., {{began on}} June 21, 1886, {{and went on}} until August 11. The trial was {{conducted}} {{in an atmosphere of}} extreme prejudice by both public and media toward <b>the</b> <b>defendants.</b> It was presided over by Judge Joseph Gary. Judge Gary displayed open hostility to <b>the</b> <b>defendants,</b> consistently ruled for the prosecution, and failed to maintain decorum. A motion to try <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> separately was denied. The defense counsel included Sigmund Zeisler, William Perkins Black, William Foster, and Moses Salomon. Selection of the jury was extraordinarily difficult, lasting three weeks, and nearly one thousand people called. All union members and anyone who expressed sympathy toward socialism were dismissed. In the end a jury of 12 was seated, most of whom confessed prejudice towards <b>the</b> <b>defendants.</b> Despite their professions of prejudice Judge Gary seated those who declared that despite their prejudices they would acquit if the evidence supported it, refusing to dismiss for prejudice. Eventually the peremptory challenges of the defense were exhausted. Frustrated by the hundreds of jurors who were being dismissed, a bailiff was appointed who selected jurors rather than calling them at random. The bailiff proved prejudiced himself and selected jurors who seemed likely to convict based on their social position and attitudes toward <b>the</b> <b>defendants.</b> The prosecution, led by Julius Grinnell, argued that since <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> had not actively discouraged the person who had thrown the bomb, they were therefore equally responsible as conspirators. The jury heard the testimony of 118 people, including 54 members of the Chicago Police Department and <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> Fielden, Schwab, Spies and Parsons. Albert Parsons' brother claimed there was evidence linking the Pinkertons to the bomb. This reflected a widespread belief among the strikers.|$|E
5|$|While admitting none of <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> were {{involved}} in the bombing, the prosecution made the argument that Lingg had built the bomb and two prosecution witnesses (Harry Gilmer and Malvern Thompson) tried to imply the bomb thrower was helped by Spies, Fischer and Schwab. <b>The</b> <b>defendants</b> claimed they had no knowledge of the bomber at all.|$|E
5|$|Judge José A. Cabranes {{presided over}} {{the case in the}} United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. In order to defeat a defense motion to dismiss the case in 1987, the plaintff called a number of expert {{witnesses}} including psychologist Margaret Singer, author of Cults in Our Midst, and psychiatrist and neurologist James Merikangas. Both Singer and Merikangas submitted affidavits asserting that Slee's death was related to the est training. After <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> refused to respond to discovery requests, on January 18, 1990, the plaintiff filed a motion for default judgment, for failure of <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> to comply with discovery, which was denied. In 1991, before the case came to trial, defendant Erhard left the country. In 1992, a jury heard the wrongful death lawsuit. During the trial, <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> called a number of expert witnesses, including medical experts.|$|E
40|$|In a mock-trial paradigm, 205 {{participants}} {{considered a}} patricide trial {{in which a}} child <b>defendant</b> claimed <b>the</b> patricide was done in self-defense after years of sexual abuse. Participants in an empathy-induction condition were asked to take the perspective of <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> and to detail how they would be thinking and feeling if they were <b>the</b> <b>defendant.</b> Control condition participants received no such instructions. Results indicated that, compared to jurors in the control condition, jurors who were asked to take <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> perspective had more empathy for <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> (without feeling more similar to or more sympathy for <b>the</b> <b>defendant),</b> found <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> less guilty and less responsible for the murder, {{and were more likely}} to consider abuse to be a mitigating factor in the killing. Overall, compared to men, women were more likely to believe <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> abuse allegations, find <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> credible, and consider <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> to be less responsible for the murder. Women in the empathy condition found <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> less guilty than did all other jurors. Finally, child defendant gender was also varied, but this had few effects on case judgments overall. Jurors, however, were more likely to believe that <b>the</b> girl <b>defendant</b> wa...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> and <b>the</b> {{claimant}} were {{situated at}} Liverpool and Birkenhead respectively. <b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> called at <b>the</b> {{office of the}} claimant in order to negotiate the purchase of some houses. <b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> handed <b>the</b> claimant a note giving him the option to purchase some houses within 14 days. On the next day, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> withdrew <b>the</b> offer by post, but this withdrawal did not reach the claimant until 5 P.M. Meanwhile, the claimant responded by post with an unconditional acceptance of the offer, which was delivered to <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> after its office had closed.

5|$|On July 7, 2009, Judge Naves {{found that}} <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> (university) were {{entitled}} to quasi-judicial immunity {{as a matter of}} law, vacated the jury verdict and determined that the University did not owe Churchill any financial compensation. Naves denied Churchill's request for reinstatement at CU.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, 2008, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) {{announced}} {{the arrest of}} 96 individuals, of whom 75 were San Diego State University students, {{on a variety of}} drug charges in a multiple-month narcotics sting called Operation Sudden Fall. Two kilograms of cocaine were seized, along with 50 pounds of marijuana, 350 Ecstasy pills, hash oil, methamphetamine, other drug paraphernalia, three guns, and $60,000 in cash. Several months after the May 6 announcement, it was reported that the majority of <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> had pleaded guilty to the felony charges. <b>The</b> <b>defendants</b> were then either placed on probation or were required to enter drug diversion programs. Other defendants only received citations or had their cases dismissed.|$|E
5|$|On Wednesday 19 June {{the court}} opened at 9am; the {{indictment}} on three of <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> was read for forcibly entering {{the house of}} Robert Speechly in Littleport and stealing personal property. Mr Gurney addressed the jury, who later pronounced all defendants guilty.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>defendant’s</b> first {{court date}} {{is called the}} initial appearance. The court informs <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> of <b>the</b> charges filed against him or her and gives <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> {{a copy of the}} complaint. The court also informs <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> of his or her right to have an {{attorney}} and that if <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> is indigent and requests counsel, the court will appoint an attorney. If <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> is in custody, the court determines whether to release <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> on bail, and if <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> is released, imposes conditions for bail. In a misdemeanor case, the court may set the trial date at the initial appearance. The next court action in a misdemeanor case is the arraignment. Further steps are required in a felony case. At the initial appearance, the court informs a felony defendant {{that he or she is}} entitled to a preliminary examination before the criminal case may go forward.|$|R

25|$|In a {{conversion}} suit, {{it is no}} defense to claim that <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> was not negligent or that <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> acquired <b>the</b> plaintiff's property through the plaintiff's unilateral mistake, or that <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> acted in complete innocence and perfect good faith.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>defendants</b> {{appealed to}} the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On December 23, 1973, Judge Levin H. Campbell, for the {{unanimous}} panel, affirmed. Because the trust relationship was found, the First Circuit did not reach the third issue.|$|E

25|$|If the trier of {{fact has}} no doubt as to <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> guilt, or if their only doubts are {{unreasonable}} doubts, then the prosecutor has proved <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> guilt {{beyond a reasonable doubt}} and <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> should be pronounced guilty.|$|R

25|$|The Court {{found in}} Harris v. New York, , that a {{confession}} obtained {{in violation of}} the Miranda standards may nonetheless be used for purposes of impeaching <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> testimony: that is, if <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> takes <b>the</b> stand at trial and the prosecution wishes to introduce <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> confession as a prior inconsistent statement to attack <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> credibility, <b>the</b> Miranda holding will not prohibit this.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>defendants</b> {{were subject}} to fines of up to $100,000 per {{violation}} of the Spyware Act and $2,000 per violation of the Consumer Protection Act if found liable. They were also subject to paying restitution to affected consumers.|$|E
5|$|Townsend was arraigned on 20 August, but {{strongly}} {{questioned the}} view that his writings were subversive {{as well as the}} legal foundations of the charges. Along with the other defendants, Townsend was as before strongly defended by senators with anti-interventionist sympathies, including Gerald Nye who said <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> were no more guilty of sedition than he had been for speaking out against intervening in the war. In fact there were from the beginning many concerns even within the US government about the validity of the proceedings and their constitutionality as no clear evidence had yet been uncovered to demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> were in collusion with Nazi Germany or with each other.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed at {{the popular}} appeal of Paine's Rights of Man, the king issued a {{proclamation}} against seditious writings in May 1792. Booksellers and printers bore {{the brunt of}} this law, the effects of which {{came to a head}} in the 1794 Treason Trials. Johnson testified, publicly distancing himself from Paine and Barlow, despite the fact that <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> were received sympathetically by the juries.|$|E
50|$|For example: {{a witness}} who testifies that he saw <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> shoot <b>the</b> victim gives direct evidence. A witness who testifies that he saw <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> fleeing <b>the</b> scene of the crime, or a {{forensics}} expert who says that ballistics proves that <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> gun shot <b>the</b> bullet that killed the victim both give circumstantial evidence from which <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> guilt may be inferred.|$|R

50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> deems that <b>the</b> {{punishment}} that would, concretely, be handed down {{is less than}} a five-year imprisonment (or that it would just be a fine), <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> may request to plea bargain with <b>the</b> prosecutor. <b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> is rewarded with a reduction on the sentence and has other advantages (such as that <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> does not pay the fees on <b>the</b> proceeding). <b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> must accept <b>the</b> penalty for the charges (even if the plea-bargained sentence has some particular matters in further compensation proceedings), no matter how serious the charges are.|$|R
