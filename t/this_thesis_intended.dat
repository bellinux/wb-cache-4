Many of these pieces are written with materials that extend beyond common practice tonality. Unfortunately most study materials {{are written in}} a highly tonal language and date to the Romantic or late Romantic periods. Further, almost all studies written in a modern style are advanced and not progressive in difficulty. As {{a result of the}} lack of progressive post-tonal study materials, students are rarely prepared for post-tonal solo works. The traits that mark these pieces as modern pose particular difficulties for tonally-trained students. <b>This</b> <b>thesis,</b> <b>intended</b> for the collegiate instructor of horn, illustrates a method for addressing this disparity, using The Sonata for E-flat Alto Horn and Piano by Paul Hindemith as an example.

For this, I used a combination of biological and social sampling methods. The results show that harvest of endemic pigeons is performed predominantly for commercial purposes by a small and specialized group of hunters, but is also widely practiced opportunistically by most hunters and rural inhabitants. The hunting pressure on the two least abundant species already determines their patterns of distribution and abundance, and their extraction is probably unsustainable. Harvesting of the most hunted species is potentially sustainable, but more research is essential to the definition of measures to manage the species. Only one species is not commercially hunted and exploitation for subsistence is sustainable. The conservation of the species on the long term requires the development of specific measures; it is essential to promote legal restrictions on hunting and trading, to search for economic alternatives for bird hunting and define strategies of education / awareness of consumersFCT - PhD grant and the I&D project “Endemic pigeons of São Tomé: developing science-based conservation and sustainable use of African pigeons...|$|E

The purpose {{was to examine the}} process of sheltered accommodation for girls at Styrka and investigate whether the three categories girls, social workers, and staff had an unanimous view regarding the process of the sheltered housing. Through semi-structured interviews, ten informants, four girls who previously lived at Styrka, four social workers and two out of Somaya's staff, were interviewed. The results showed that the girls and the social secretaries subconsciously expressed an understanding of the housing process and that they understood that the staff worked to meet the girl in the phase she was in. The process and the phases the staff saw, and worked according to, where the moving in phase, landing phase, happiness phase, liberation phase, and the moving out phase. Initially, it was important for the girls to feel trust, be protected and believed, get help quickly, and feel secure. The social workers felt that the protection and safety at Styrka was good, but that it at times could be different opinions about the potential relief efforts. All of the girls were happy with their stay at Styrka.

40|$|Since the {{teaching}} of English in Indonesia focuses on reading comprehension, {{it is important for}} students to have the skills of comprehending English written texts. <b>This</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>intended</b> to present a technique which may help the students comprehend the reading texts better. The writer's experience shows that many SMU students got difficulties in understanding the English textbooks. They tend to read word by word and also they still spend alot of time trying to comprehend the reading texts. This thesis suggests some ideas about teaching reading through Gestalt Psychology. Through this technique it is expected that the teacher can help the students comprehend the reading texts better. The good thing of using gestalt is that although students do not correctly say every word, they are able to guess the missing parts and thus are able to maintain a general idea of the meaning of the passage. Finding the main idea is a key to understand a paragraph on a short selection. It is expected that Gestalt Psychology can give some contribution to SMU teachers in their efforts to increase the students reading ability and to eliminate boredom in reading classes. Consequently, in the application of Gestalt, teacher should creative to guide the students and must help them mastery the learning and also he has to give some questions which help the students to predict the passage. Since the ideas presented here are quite theoretical, it is expected that other thesis writing students do some experiments to see whether these ideas can work in real teaching or not...|$|E

The root rot fungus Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato (s. l.) is the main P. abies pathogen. Including resistance in breeding programs would help mitigating {{the impact of the}} pathogen but knowledge regarding defense mechanisms in P. abies needs a better understanding. The work within <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>intended</b> to expand the existing knowledge on P. abies resistance mechanisms focusing on hormone signaling, flavonoid biosynthesis and its transcriptional regulation. I found that jasmonic acid is the major hormone controlling defense signaling pathways in P. abies. Furthermore, we validated a candidate gene, PaLAR 3, as a resistance marker for H. annosum s. l. in P. abies. PaLAR 3 encodes an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of (+) catechin, which showed a fungistatic effect on H. parviporum. Analysis of genetic diversity revealed two allelic lineages of PaLAR 3 that showed significant differences in fungal resistance and (+) catechin content that were explained by dissimilarities in inducibility. We studied the role of PaNAC 03, a transcription factor that is associated with H. annosum s. l. infection. PaNAC 03 not only showed repression of multiple genes including PaLAR 3, but bound only to the promoter of one of the PaLAR 3 allelic lineages explaining at least partly the differences in allelic expression that were observed. Finally, we identified a full repertoire of members of a MYB/bHLH/WDR transcription factor complex in Norway spruce, which showed differences in protein interactions and expression patterns, and also in ability to control the expression of genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway including PaLAR 3...|$|E

Specifically, in terms of acute exercise responses, we aimed at investigating the submaximal exercise capacity and cardiac autonomic function of adults with and without DS. Subsequently, we determined whether 12 weeks of exercise training were effective in improving exercise capacity (economy and peak oxygen uptake – VO 2 peak) and autonomic function both in adults with and without DS. Overall, {{we found that the}} submaximal exercise capacity of adults with DS was characterized by poor walking economy, but appropriate VO 2 kinetics. As importantly, these individuals demonstrated reduced cardiac responsiveness to changes in the sympathovagal balance resulting from submaximal dynamic exercise. Findings also indicated a breakdown in their fractal scaling properties of heart rate dynamics that was transversal to resting, exercise and post-exercise recovery conditions. Moreover, compared to nondisabled participants, adults with DS showed reduced cardiodeceleration during recovery from peak exercise intensities. Finally, in general terms, a combined exercise regimen resulted in gains of similar magnitude between participants with and without DS for submaximal exercise capacity and cardiac autonomic function. In conclusion, this thesis provides evidence that persons with DS have reduced submaximal exercise capacity and that this is paired by disturbed autonomic function. Nevertheless, these results also indicate that exercise training is an effective intervention for improving their physiological function in similar magnitude as in adults without DS.

The financial and physical cost of obesity and overweight continues to rise. Obesity and overweight are characterised as relapsing conditions which can share psychopathology with eating disorders. <b>This</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>intended</b> to evaluate current psychological approaches to obesity and overweight which was under-researched. It explored a compassionate mind approach intervention for weight management which focused on psychosocial factors present in obesity and overweight. The systematic literature review evaluated psychological interventions for the treatment of obesity and overweight. Twelve articles were reviewed and assessed for methodological quality. The results demonstrated short-term treatment efficacy for behavioural therapy but the evidence for the most effective form of psychological intervention was inconclusive. There was no conclusive evidence that psychological interventions offered long-term weight-loss maintenance. A requirement for further research into psychological interventions for obesity and overweight using robust methodology was indicated. Methodological issues were considered which may have limited the conclusions of the review. The empirical study was a randomised control trial that lasted for six months. Thirty six participants received either compassionate mind approach guided self-help (GSH) or treatment as usual (TAU) in a dietetic clinic. Measures of shame, self-compassion, psychological wellbeing, disordered eating, physical activity and BMI were taken at pre and post-intervention. No statistically significant results were demonstrated for GSH or TAU in terms of these factors. Treatment effect sizes were observed for GSH regarding levels of external shame, self-compassion and preoccupation with shape and for TAU regarding levels of uncontrolled eating. The results suggested that eating psychopathology and psychosocial factors are relevant in treatment seeking obese populations and these should be explored when developing interventions. The study limitations, clinical implications and future research were discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The research described in <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>intended</b> to review the current mix design procedures for Slurry Seal and Micro-surfacing and suggest modifications to the actual International Slurry Seal Association (ISSA) mix design procedure for microsurfacing as a high performance surface treatment and pavement preservation method. The first part of study reports the findings of a detailed laboratory investigation concerning the effect of asphalt emulsion, added water content, and the use of additives (Portland cement) on the design parameters and properties of micro-surfacing mixtures. For this, one aggregate type, one asphalt emulsion type/grade, and one aggregate gradation were used in the study. The evaluation was conducted at one curing stages of the mix (24 -Hours). Three levels of asphalt emulsion, four levels of added water content, and one level of Portland cement were used in order to evaluate role of asphalt emulsion, water, and cement. This part of study consisted mainly of establishing a method for preparing and testing micro-surfacing mixture using four main mixture design tests proposed by the ISSA (TB 139, TB 113, TB 100, and TB 109).

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [51]- 53) This thesis {{focuses on}} the freedoms of expression available to {{a specific type of}} artist: the Christian artist. Many well-known artists of the twentieth century have painted, sculpted or designed the occasional work for a church or have, on occasion, used Christian subject matter for various reasons. But what is more seldom seen is the artist who devotes a substantial amount of his work to his belief, experience, growth and life in Jesus Christ. There are, though, a sufficient number of successful Christian artists in the twentieth century to prove the authenticity of, and interest in, modern Christian art. This paper will document the freedoms that belong to the Christian artist: freedoms of truth and expression gained through the movement of modernism and through God. To elaborate, the freedoms the Christian artist has gained through modernism will be the same freedoms of any other modern artist, but a new dimension of freedom is added when that modern artist is also a Christian; {{this is due to the}} freedoms that artist has accepted from his God. In addition to its central concern, Christian faith, this presentation has faith-oriented components regarding the motivations and personal expression of the artists in their work and social components regarding the effects the artists have on their communities and which the communities have on them. <b>This</b> <b>thesis,</b> <b>intended</b> to be polemical and apologetic, is divided into seven chapters, each focusing on a different freedom of truth and/or expression belonging to the modern Christian artist: 1) freedom from tradition and the past; 2) freedom of truth and expression; 3) freedom from the object; 4) art as a language; 5) freedom to obey the inner voice; 6) freedom of creation; and 7) freedom to interact with a community and its individuals.

40|$|<b>This</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>intended</b> to be a {{comparison}} and {{an examination of}} the differences between Chu Hsi and Wang Yang-ming in their interpretations of the concept "ko-wu" (格物) in the Ta-hsueh (《大學》,the Great Learning). As is well-known, Chu plays a significant role not only in reaffirming the importance of the Ta-hsueh as the basis curriculum for self-cultivation, but also in adding a supplement to the text, claiming that it embodies the original meaning of the lost chapter on "ko-wu". In this supplement, Chu maintains that to "ko-wu" means to "chiung- 1 i" (窮理), that is, to investigate the principles inherent in things. Quite to the contrary, in the conviction that "chih liang-chih" (致良知), that is, to extend the innate knowledge of the good, is the most crucial in the learning process, Wang defines "ko-wu" as "cheng-shih" (正事), which means to rectifying things. This thesis will illustrate the following points: (1) "li" (理, the principle) in Chu's system actually represents both the principle of morality and the laws according to which things run. (2) This very fact will inevitably cause theoretical problems to Chu's moral philosophy. (3) In an attempt to solve these problems, Wang confines the meaning of "li" to moral principle. (4) In so doing, Wang, however, has actually reverted the order of the learning process originally outlined in the Ta-hsueh. (5) In additions, Wang's action will deceptively lead people to considering him a proponent of subjective idealism. This thesis will conclude that as strong advocates of the significance of self-cultivation as they are, their theories of "ko-wu" entail special ontological commitments, the validity of which is, nevertheless, difficult to prove or disprove, without mentioning the detrimental effects they may cause to their moral philosophies...|$|E
40|$|Poor {{quality and}} unrefreshing sleep {{is one of}} the most common symptom {{complaints}} in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Despite this, the links between sleep dysfunction and CFS are not well understood, and there has been an absence of good quality research into the nature of sleep problems in CFS, which also lack consistency in the data reported. However, it remains plausible that sleep problems may help to maintain and exacerbate other existing symptoms. Given the dispute in models ranging from the biological to the psychological, competing to explain symptomology, it is a critical time by which we try to understand the relationship between poor sleep, fatigue, endocrine activity and CFS, in an attempt to shortcircuit this debate. With an aim to redress this, <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>intended</b> to examine the role of sleep from several angles, utilizing a range of assessment methods; Study 1 addressed the lack of in depth qualitative interview studies, to understand the extent to which sleep, its management and problems, are linked to the lived experience of CFS, and how it interacts with other symptoms (chapter 3). Patient narratives demonstrated that sleep disturbances experienced were highly unpredictable and variable over time, but played a key role in symptom maintenance; Study 2 examined self-reported sleep (via sleep diaries) in CFS patients, exploring whether sleep quality and daytime napping had an impact on daytime fatigue, sleepiness and cognitive functioning (key dimensions of the illness experience) (chapter 4). The results were highly variable but indicated that afternoon-evening napping was associated with greater impairment in daytime cognitive functioning in CFS patients. It was also evident that CFS patients with longer wake time and a shorter diagnosis had more severe fatigue; Study 3 explored the possibility that sleep problems in this population are not homogeneous and revealed four sleep-specific phenotypes to exist, which are amenable to different treatment approaches.
