40|$|The Index of Receptivity to Tobacco Industry Promotion (IRTIP) is a {{model that}} is used by {{hundreds}} of articles. The causal claim based on findings from this model is even more pervasive, and has resulted in much of the modern post 1998 tobacco legislation that is still enforced. This thesis tested the link between adolescent receptivity to tobacco industry promotion and susceptibility to smoking. Pierce et al. (1998) reported that they had found a positive and causal association between receptivity and susceptibility by using IRTIP. They claimed that receptivity to tobacco industry promotion was the only significant causal factor affecting adolescent susceptibility to smoking. Exposure to peer and parental smoking was not found to be a significant effect. A review of the literature found that many sections of IRTIP differ from accepted marketing theory on how cigarette advertising and promotions affect adolescent adoption of cigarette smoking. The proxy measures used in IRTIP were shown to diverge from those previously used for measuring the constructs of Attention, Intention, Desire and Action (AIDA) in marketing communications. IRTIP also differs from previous theory by including measures that attempt to quantify the effect of <b>tobacco</b> <b>premiums</b> into a model that was designed to measure the effects of advertising. <br /...|$|E

40|$|A {{communication}} containing {{proposals for}} {{reform of the}} EU tobacco regime was forwarded by the European Commission to the EU Council and European Parliament on September 23 rd 2003. These proposals involve: the progressive decoupling of the existing <b>tobacco</b> <b>premium</b> from production over a three-year period; the phasing-out of the tobacco fund; {{the establishment of a}} special fund under the rural development pillar to support restructuring in tobacco-growing areas. By the end of the reform period more than 70 % of the current <b>tobacco</b> <b>premium</b> will have been converted into the single farm payment and at least 20 % will be deployed as restructuring assistance. A detailed assessment of the situation and options for reform in the EU tobacco sector {{can be found in a}} Commission staff working paper 'Extended Impact Assessment: Tobacco Regime. Full details of the Commission's proposals for reform of the tobacco regime, alongside a summary assessment of the current situation, can be found in the text of the Commission's communication to the Council and European Parliament on 'Accomplishing a sustainable agricultural model for Europe through the reformed CAP: the tobacco, olive oil, cotton and sugar sectors'. It is envisaged that the reform process will 'bring better market orientation and income growth for producers, in addition to the positive impact on producer income development from the increased transfer efficiency of decoupled payments'. This is especially the case for small scale producers who will receive a larger part of their income through the single farm payments. The reform process will also lead to the cessation of production of less profitable varieties of tobacco and the conversion of land to other uses. By the end of the reform period it is anticipated that EU prices will be aligned with world market prices. Comment: The alignment of EU prices with world market prices which the reform process is intended to bring about is likely to reduce the income to ACP suppliers of tobacco to the EU market. These price effects will need to be carefully assessed in the light of the prices which ACP suppliers currently enjoy. A communication containing proposals for reform of the EU tobacco [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Speaking to the European Parliament on September 23 rd 2003 the Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler {{outlined}} the proposals {{contained in the}} second round of the CAP mid-term review proposals. He pointed out that the trend towards decoupling was now firmly established, and argued that the more products which would be included in the single farm payment scheme the better. Against this background the Commission has put forward a communication on reform of the common market organisation for olive oil, tobacco and cotton. Reform proposals in the olive oil, tobacco and cotton sectors are aimed at reorienting support to 'reward healthy, high quality products and practices' and to supporting the development of 'alternative sources of income and economic activity'. In order to achieve this the majority of support is to be decoupled from production and integrated into the single farm payment scheme. Since the production of these crops is concentrated in less favoured regions of the EU it is also proposed to strengthen the rural development measures for these regions. For tobacco the existing <b>tobacco</b> <b>premium</b> is to be decoupled over a three-year period alongside a phasing out of the tobacco fund. During this transition period a special fund will be set up under the rural development pillar to support restructuring in tobacco-growing areas. By the end of the reform period more than 70 % of the current <b>tobacco</b> <b>premium</b> will have been converted into the single farm payments and at least 20 % will be deployed as restructuring assistance. In the olive-oil sector the approach is to be modified, for there are concerns that a complete conversion into a single decoupled payment scheme could lead to land abandonment in traditional production areas. For this reason 40 % of payments are to remain linked to production with 60 % being decoupled and incorporated into the single farm payment scheme. In the cotton sector the Commission has proposed to incorporate part of the current support into the single farm payment scheme and to transform the rest into production aid granted as an area payment. Here again only partial decoupling is to occur. Commissioner Fischler noted that a slightly different approach was being adopted in the sugar sector with three options being put forward for further discussion. This follows the approach adopted in the dairy sector and is designed to find an approach which will minimise land abandonment throughout the EU. Further discussion was felt to be necessary since 'the sugar sector is a sensitive and also complicated sector, which has never, until now, been fundamentally reformed'. It is felt that there is therefore a need for a political debate on sugar-sector reform. Commissioner Fischler noted that in the sugar sector it was clear that any reform of the sugar market will have to: bridge the gap between domestic and world market prices; involve a decoupling of support; weigh the pros and cons of the quota system; take into account the international impact of reform. A concise summary of the situation in the raw tobacco, olive oil and cotton sectors, an explanation of how the common organisation of the market works and a summary of the situation on world markets can be found in the Commission memorandum of September 23 rd 2003. Comment: Reform of the EU tobacco regime is likely to exert a downward price on EU tobacco prices, which could affect ACP earnings from tobacco exports. More fundamentally, the facilitation of disengagement of EU farming from tobacco production will intensify pressures to reduce tobacco consumption in the EU, which could result in a shrinking of the EU tobacco market. In the olive oil and cotton sectors only partial decoupling is proposed. This highlights the extent to which the EU is willing to retain coupled farm payments where this is necessary to keep land under production, setting limits on the extent to which the EU can move over to decoupled farm payments. The Commission's cautious approach to sugar-sector reform highlights the sensitivity of this sector within the EU.

50|$|The {{southern}} United States was distinctive for {{its production}} of <b>tobacco,</b> which earned <b>premium</b> prices {{from around the}} world. Most farmers grew a little for their own use, or traded with neighbours who grew it.

Southerners dominated the tobacco industry in the United States; even a concern as large as the Helme Tobacco Company, headquartered in New Jersey, was headed by former Confederate officer George Washington Helme. In 1938 R.J. Reynolds marketed eighty-four brands of chewing tobacco, twelve brands of smoking tobacco, and the top-selling Camel brand of cigarettes. Reynolds sold large quantities of chewing tobacco, though that market peaked about 1910.|$|R
