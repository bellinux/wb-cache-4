5|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> NHL season would be suspended due to a lockout, Samuelsson initially signed with Genève-Servette HC of the Swiss National League A in September 2004. He appeared in 12 games for the club, recording six points. A month after signing in Switzerland, he returned to Södertälje SK of the Elitserien in late October. He recorded 20 points over 29 games as the club qualified for the eighth and final playoff spot, where they were defeated by Färjestad BK in four-straight games.

5|$|On December 18, 2011, CMLL {{announced}} that their World Heavyweight Champion Héctor Garza {{had decided to}} leave CMLL to work for Perros del Mal Producciones, vacating the championship.

The main event of the December 25 Domigos Arena México show was a 10-man torneo cibernetico elimination match designed to reduce the field of championship contenders from ten to two. The match ended when El Terrible pinned Marco Corleone to eliminate him, leaving El Terrible and Rush to face off the following week. On January 1, 2012, El Terrible defeated Rush in two-out-of-three falls to become the seventeenth overall champion.|$|E
5|$|The FA Charity Shield {{was founded}} in 1908 as a {{successor}} to the Sheriff of London Charity Shield.

5|$|Two {{competing}} hypotheses {{exist in}} Egyptology {{to describe the}} succession of events running from the death of Neferirkare Kakai, the third king of the Fifth Dynasty, to the coronation of Nyuserre Ini, the sixth ruler of the dynasty. Relying on historical sources, where Nyuserre {{is said to have}} directly succeeded Neferefre, many Egyptologists such as Jürgen von Beckerath and Hartwig Altenmüller have traditionally believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> succession took place: Neferirkare Kakai → Shepseskare → Neferefre → Nyuserre Ini. In this scenario, Neferefre is the father of Nyuserre, who would have become pharaoh after Neferefre's unexpected death. Neferefre would be the successor of Shepseskare, credited with seven years of reign, as indicated in Manetho's Aegyptiaca.|$|E
5|$|A {{scientific}} study of the water quality parameters of physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics and role of phumdis in the Loktak Lake has been conducted by collecting surface water samples on monthly basis from 15 stations, representing 5 zones; northern, western, eastern, middle and southern. The test results indicated that water quality in the phumdi area was poor in {{the northern and southern}} zones of the lake; test results indicated low dissolved oxygen, low pH (normal range for pH in surface water systems is 6.5 to 8.5) high CO2 and high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) but the water quality was good in the open water area. Assessment of the total nitrogen content of the macrophyte species of phumdis indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> were present in descending order: Salvinia natans (1.8%), Zizania latifolia (1.6%), Capillipedium sp. (1.3%), Brachiaria mutica (1.2%), Cyperus brevifolius (1.2%), Echinochloa stagnina (1.0%), Phragmites karka (1.0%) and Hedychium coranarium (0.94%). The test results confirmed the fact that the phumdis were efficient in absorbing nutrients from the lake water. However, they deteriorated water quality due to reduced light penetration and accumulation of organic matter in the lake ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|When Mackintosh and the depot-laying party {{finally reached}} Cape Evans in mid-June, {{they learned that}} Aurora, with 18 men on board and {{carrying}} most of the shore party's supplies and equipment, had broken loose from its winter mooring during a gale. Ice conditions in McMurdo Sound {{made it impossible for}} the ship to return; the shore party of ten was effectively marooned, with drastically depleted resources. However, most of the stores required for the depots had been landed. Mackintosh therefore resolved <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> season's work would be carried out to the full: depots would be laid across the Great ice Barrier {{all the way to the}} Beardmore Glacier. The party would seek to make up its lack of supplies and equipment by salvaging the stores left by earlier expeditions, particularly from Captain Scott's recent sojourn at Cape Evans. The entire party pledged its support to this effort, though it would require, wrote Mackintosh, a record-breaking feat of polar travel to accomplish it. However, the long months of preparation were difficult for Mackintosh. The only officer in the party, he found it hard to form close relationships with his companions. His position became increasingly isolated, and subject to the frequent vocal criticisms of Joyce in particular.|$|E
