500|$|Niffenegger {{began writing}} the novel in 1997; the last scene, {{in which an}} aged Clare is waiting for Henry, was written first, {{because it is the}} story's focal point. The {{narrative}} was originally structured thematically. Responding to comments from readers of early drafts of the manuscript, Niffenegger reorganized the narrative so that it largely followed Clare's timeline. The work was finished in 2001. With no history of commercial publication, Niffenegger had trouble finding interested literary agents—25 rejected the manuscript. In 2002, she sent it unsolicited to the small, San Francisco-based publisher MacAdam/Cage, where it reached Anika Streitfeld. Streitfeld, who became Niffenegger's editor, [...] "thought it was incredible. Right from the very beginning you feel like you are in capable hands, that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> who has a story to tell and who knows how to tell it." [...] She gave it to David Poindexter, the founder of the publishing firm, [...] "who read it overnight and decided to buy the book". However, Niffenegger had acquired an agent by this time, and several publishing houses in New York City were interested in the novel. The manuscript was put up for auction and MacAdam/Cage bid US$100,000, by far the largest sum it had ever offered for a book. Although another publisher outbid them, Niffenegger selected MacAdam/Cage because they were so dedicated to her work. Also, Niffenegger explains that her [...] "own natural inclination is to go small. My background is in punk music—I'd always pick the indie company over the giant corporation." ...|$|E
500|$|Philip Nel {{places the}} book's title {{character}} {{in the tradition of}} con artists in American art, including the title characters from Meredith Willson's The Music Man and L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Nel also contends that Geisel identified with the Cat, pointing to a self portrait of Geisel in which he appears as the Cat, which was published alongside a profile about him in The Saturday Evening Post on July 6, 1957. Michael K. Frith, who worked as Geisel's editor, concurs, arguing that [...] "The Cat in the Hat and Ted Geisel were inseparable and the same. I think there's no question about it. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> who delighted in the chaos of life, who delighted in the seeming insanity of the world around him." [...] Ruth MacDonald asserts that the Cat's primary goal in the book is to create fun for the children. The Cat calls it [...] "fun that is funny", which MacDonald distinguishes from the ordinary, serious fun that parents subject their children to. In an article titled [...] "Was the Cat in the Hat Black?", Philip Nel draws connections between the Cat and stereotyped depictions of African-Americans, including minstrel shows, Geisel's own minstrel-inspired cartoons from early in his career, {{and the use of the}} term [...] "cat" [...] to refer to jazz musicians. According to Nel, [...] "Even as [...] wrote books designed to challenge prejudice, he never fully shed the cultural assumptions he grew up with, and was likely unaware of the ways in which his visual imagination replicated the racial ideologies he consciously sought to reject." ...|$|E

"With Walsh or Starr, the {{president}} and his supporters could more easily argue that a prosecutor was overzealous or irresponsible, because there had been a three-judge panel that appointed him. [...] With Fitzgerald, you have a prosecutor who was appointed by the deputy attorney general [...] The administration almost has to stand behind him because <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> they selected themselves. It is harder to criticize someone you yourself put into play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hugh Laurie as Senator Tom James: {{a charming}} senator and Selina's new running mate after Doyle leaves the ticket. He is {{extremely}} popular with his colleagues and with voters. Selina {{was reluctant to}} pick him as a running mate {{out of fear that}} he would remember a time they nearly slept together. He frustrates Meyer at his desire to be involved with the economy, {{going so far as to}} request to serve simultaneously as Vice President and Secretary of the Treasury. In the general election, loophole rules in the Constitution dictate that in certain circumstances, James could become the Acting President (and subsequently President), further angering Selina. He offers that, should this occur, he would like her to be his Vice President. She later appoints him as her economy czar. Before the fourth season, Armando Iannucci met with Laurie in the UK after learning that he was a fan of Veep. The two began developing the character Tom James alongside the show's writers (also based in the UK). Iannucci describes Tom James as a [...] "normal, but ambitious operator ... <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> who seems to outdo [...] in his ability." [...] (Seasons 4–6) ...|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{the reason}} for voter decline in the recent 2016 {{election}} is likely because of restrictive voting laws around the country. Brennan Center for Justice reported that in 2016 fourteen states passed restrictive voting laws. Examples of these laws are photo ID mandates, narrow times for early voter, and limitations on voter registration. Barbour and Wright also believe that one of the causes is restrictive voting laws but they call this system of laws regulating the electorate. The Constitution gives states the power to make decisions regarding restrictive voting laws. In 2008 the Supreme Court made a crucial decision regarding Indiana’s voter ID law in saying that it does not violate the constitution. Since then almost half of the states have passed restrictive voting laws. These laws contribute to Barbour and Wrights idea of the rational nonvoter. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> who does not vote because the benefits of them not voting outweighs the cost to vote. These laws add to the “cost” of voting, or reason that make it more difficult and to vote. In the United States programs such as MTV's [...] "Rock the Vote" [...] and the [...] "Vote or Die" [...] initiatives have been introduced to increase turnouts of those between the ages of 18 and 25. A number of governments and electoral commissions have also launched efforts to boost turnout. For instance Elections Canada has launched mass media campaigns to encourage voting prior to elections, as have bodies in Taiwan and the United Kingdom.|$|E

But now Skelly—the grandfather—has Alzheimer's disease and everything has changed for Jake. Indeed, it is now like Jake is the adult and Skelly is the kid. More than that, it seems like caring for his grandfather has been very much left {{up to him and}} that puts an increased burden on his own life.|$|R

5000|$|The {{precocious}} Raphael, who {{was eleven}} at his father's death, continued {{to run his}} father's workshop with help from his family. It has often been speculated that Viti contributed to Raphael's training. [...] In any case they remained friends, and Viti obtained or inherited the most important group of Raphael's studio drawings, which his descendents sold to Pierre Crozat in the 17th century. [...] Drawings have often been disputed between the two artists in the past, and Viti has also been accused of forging some Raphael drawings (though it seems now accepted <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> else).|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} of a therapist into a couple's dynamics may be problematic. It may be {{experienced by the}} non-client as the client-partner having an emotional affair with the therapist. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> granted {{a greater degree of}} intimacy and confiding than themselves. The tendency to create a mate-substitute out of the therapist may be especially acute in incest survivors.|$|E

5000|$|A Jean Duvet from Dijon is also {{recorded}} {{working as a}} goldsmith in Calvinist Geneva from 1540-56, but most scholarly opinion now believes that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> else, probably his nephew. [...] The question perhaps cannot be regarded as entirely settled. The Geneva Duvet was recorded {{as the son of}} [...] "Loys Duvey, alias Drot de Dijon", probably Jean Duvet's brother, who became a Master in 1509. Eisler and Blunt favour the Geneva figure being Duvet himself, followed by Marqusee; Zerner and R. May do not. Yet another Jean Duvet, working as a goldsmith in Geneva, was condemned to death for extortion in Geneva in 1576.|$|R
50|$|A related {{novel by}} Deighton, Yesterday's Spy (1975), also {{features}} {{some of the}} same characters that appeared in Spy Story, although 'Harry Palmer' is not apparently amongst them. It has been theorised that the protagonist in another of Deighton's spy novels, An Expensive Place to Die (1967), also written in the first-person-anonymous narrative, is also 'Harry Palmer'; however, differences in characterisation and plotting indicate <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> else other than Palmer.|$|E
