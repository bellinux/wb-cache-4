25|$|The Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA) is the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the Albany Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Every {{metropolitan}} {{area in the}} United States {{with a population of}} over 50,000 must have a MPO in order to get any federal transportation funding. The US Department of Transportation (USDOT) uses an MPO to make decisions on what projects are most important to a metro area for immediate versus long <b>term</b> <b>funding.</b> The USDOT will not approve federal funds for transportation projects unless they are on an MPO's list. The Adirondack/Glens Falls Transportation Council (A/GFTC) is the MPO for the Glens Falls MSA (and the town of Moreau, in Saratoga County).|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, the CTA, {{projecting}} a $55 million funding {{shortfall in}} its 2005 budget, {{called for a}} [...] "long <b>term</b> <b>funding</b> solution," [...] involving a change to the sales tax distribution formula in the RTA Act. In response, the Illinois General Assembly appropriated $54 million {{to cover the cost}} of CTA's paratransit service for 2005. An amendment to the RTA Act [...] made the RTA responsible for the funding, financial review and oversight of all ADA paratransit services, effective July 1, 2005, and transferred responsibility for operating or providing for the operation of paratransit service to Pace starting July 1, 2006, thereby relieving the CTA of that responsibility. The General Assembly also directed the Illinois Auditor General to audit the RTA and the Service Boards, as part of its review of the funding issue. The Auditor General's preliminary report, while agreeing that public funding was insufficient to support the level of transit services, said that the legislature must address other issues, including underfunded pensions, high salaries, absenteeism, and the lack of strong, centralized planning, resulting in several of the service boards competing for customers in the same areas, the Auditor General calling for [...] "an end to the transit agencies fighting each other for customers, routes and federal funding for pet projects that may not fit into an overall regional transit plan." ...|$|E

50|$|Some {{financial}} advisors recommend having {{six months}} spending saved {{in an emergency}} fund. This fund helps satisfy the goal of security. A person's goals may be short term security (the savings account), intermediate term portfolio for a child's education expenses and a longer <b>term</b> <b>fund</b> for eventual retirement. The emergency fund should be invested in very short term low risk investments. The intermediate <b>term</b> <b>fund</b> should be longer and take more risk but only moderately. While the long <b>term</b> <b>fund</b> would likely own long dated bonds, stocks and other equity investments. Circumstances of the individual can satisfy {{the needs of the}} various goals or make those needs more aggravated. For instance, a pension benefit or annuity can greatly decrease the need for a retirement fund while a scholarship eligible child can reduce the need for a college fund. An employment contract reduces the need for an emergency fund. A chronic illness might increase the need for an emergency fund.|$|R

5000|$|As {{described}} above, {{many economists}} believe that financial fragility arises when financial agents such as banks take on too many or too illiquid liabilities {{relative to the}} liquidity of their assets. Note that asset liquidity is also {{a function of the}} degree of stable funding available to market participants. As a result, the reliance on cheap short <b>term</b> <b>funding</b> creates a negative risk externality (Perotti and Suarez, 2011). Some economists propose that the government tax or limit such liabilities to reduce such excessive risk-taking. Perotti and Suarez (2009) proposed prudential Pigouvian charges on unstable short <b>term</b> <b>funding,</b> while Shin (2010) targets unstable foreign flows. Others have supported this approach.|$|E

40|$|The study aims at {{investigating}} {{the impact of}} capital market on economic growth in Nigeria. The research adopts a time-series research design depending comprehensively on secondary data with coverage from 1983 to 2013. The study employs regression analysis as data analysis method including unit root test using Augmented Dicker Fuller (ADF). The {{findings from this study}} suggest that three exhibit positive while one exhibit inverse relationship with economic growth. Also, two variables were statistically significant while the other two were statistically insignificant. We recommend that there should be an improvement in the negativity of All Share Index by encouraging extension of long <b>term</b> <b>funds</b> to investors in the capital market rather than short <b>term</b> <b>funds</b> as it will help to boost the economic growth as more funds would be invested in the economy. Also, there should be an increase in the availability and sufficiency of investment instruments such as options, derivatives, future and convertibles for investors as this will boost the value of transactions in the market...|$|R

40|$|The late 1970 s saw {{the use of}} {{geothermal}} resources located 2, 000 metres {{under the}} Ile de France region. These low temperature geothermal resources were regulated from 1978 by a decree allowing their use, as in France the ground below the surface belongs to the State. To encourage this expansion, a Short <b>Term</b> <b>Fund</b> was set up prior to 1981 to cover the geological risks linked {{to the performance of}} deep drilling. In 1982, a Long <b>Term</b> <b>Fund</b> took place managed by the SAF Environment subsidiary of the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations, to cover the operating life of the geothermal installations for 15 years. These are the measures that made possible the installation of 500 MW of thermal power for a cumulative saving in 3 MTOE of fossil fuels over a 35 -year period.

5000|$|The TAF is {{a credit}} {{facility}} {{that allows a}} depository institution to place a bid for an advance from its local Federal Reserve Bank at an interest rate that is determined {{as the result of}} an auction. By allowing the Federal Reserve to inject <b>term</b> <b>funds</b> through a broader range of counterparties and against a broader range of collateral than open market operations, this facility could help ensure that liquidity provisions can be disseminated efficiently even when the unsecured interbank markets are under stress.In short, the TAF will auction <b>term</b> <b>funds</b> of approximately one-month maturity. All depository institutions that are judged to be in sound financial condition by their local Reserve Bank and that are eligible to borrow at the discount window are also eligible to participate in TAF auctions. All TAF credit must be fully collateralized. Depositories may pledge the broad range of collateral that is accepted for other Federal Reserve lending programs to secure TAF credit. The same collateral values and margins applicable for other Federal Reserve lending programs will also apply for the TAF.|$|R
