50|$|Bladderball {{returned}} {{again to}} Yale University on October 8, 2011, despite the remaining ban. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> appeared at Dwight Hall at approximately 4:30 p.m. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> popped on High Street, {{but the game}} continued with students fighting over <b>the</b> deflated <b>ball.</b> Police {{arrived on the scene}} as <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> travelling on Elm Street, and the game ended 11 minutes after it had begun, when police interfered because of traffic that it had caused on Elm Street. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> confiscated by <b>the</b> police, who threatened to arrest students who continued to hold on to it. At least one piece of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> retained by a student.|$|R
5000|$|A {{new version}} of the play-the-ball was created which {{consisted}} of two players from each team. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> contested by only the defending marker and tackled player who <b>was</b> playing <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>the</b> marker <b>was</b> required to keep both feet on the ground until <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> dropped or placed. The other two players stood ready act as halfback should their teammate win the contest.|$|R
5|$|Three {{positions}} {{are specific to}} the field goal and PAT (point-after-touchdown) unit: the placekicker (K or PK), holder (H) and long snapper (LS). The long snapper's job is to snap the football to the holder, who will catch and position it for the placekicker. There is not usually a holder on kickoffs, because <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> kicked off of a tee; however, a holder {{may be used in}} certain situations, such as if wind is preventing the ball from remaining upright on the tee. The player on the receiving team who catches <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> known as the kickoff returner (KR).|$|E
5|$|A {{field goal}} (FG), worth three points, is scored when <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> placekicked or dropkicked through the {{uprights}} {{and over the}} crossbars of the defense's goalposts. After a PAT attempt or successful field goal the scoring team must kick the ball off to the other team.|$|E
5|$|A {{player is}} only allowed {{to catch a}} fly ball on {{the first step of}} the dugout. If the player has one foot on the first step and his other foot on the second step <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> ruled non-playable and the player is not allowed to catch it.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> racked in a {{specific}} order: <b>The</b> 15 <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> at <b>the</b> apex; the 2 and 3 <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> directly behind <b>the</b> 15 <b>ball</b> (in either order); <b>the</b> 1 <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> center; the 13 and 14 <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> behind <b>the</b> 1 <b>ball</b> (in either order); and all other <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> placed in any remaining position. Pattern racking these remaining <b>balls</b> <b>is</b> also allowed. (See illustration) ...|$|R

5000|$|... 1841 - At Bellou-en-Houlme contestants {{numbered}} up to 800 {{and there}} were said to <b>be</b> 6,000 spectators. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> three feet around and weighed 13 pounds. In this game, the losing side would often cut <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in half with their knives. To prevent this, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> sheathed in tin.|$|R
5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E
5|$|On the {{backstop}} at the {{top left}} and right corners is a metal wire that holds the backstop up and if a ball hits it and deflects foul, then <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> foul; however, if a ball deflects into fair play, then it is in play.|$|E
5|$|The lane is a {{restricted}} {{area in which}} players can stay for only {{a limited amount of}} time. On all levels, a team on the offensive (in possession of <b>the</b> <b>ball)</b> <b>is</b> prohibited to stay inside the lane for more than three seconds; after three seconds the player will be called with a three-second violation which will result in a turnover.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> {{unveiled}} during <b>the</b> {{draw for}} the competition. The name [...] "Cafusa" [...] (...) is a syllabic abbreviation {{of the words}} [...] "" [...] (Carnival), [...] "" [...] (football) and [...] "samba". Former Brazil captain Cafu, who coincidently has a similar name to <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>was</b> invited to officially unveil <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{probability}} that <b>the</b> second <b>ball</b> picked <b>is</b> red {{depends on whether}} <b>the</b> first <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> red or white. If <b>the</b> first <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> red then <b>the</b> above formula is used with [...] reduced by one. If <b>the</b> first <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> white then <b>the</b> above formula is used with [...] reduced by one.|$|R
5|$|After {{a safety}} is scored, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> put into play by a free kick. The {{team that was}} scored upon must kick the ball from their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place kick the ball. In {{professional}} play, a kicking tee cannot be used – however, a tee {{can be used in}} high school or college football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball.|$|E
5|$|After {{his time}} with the Indians ended, Coveleski spent three seasons with the Senators and one with the Yankees before {{retiring}} after the 1928 season. He retired to South Bend, Indiana, where he died in 1984. A starting pitcher, Coveleski specialized in throwing the spitball, a pitch where <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> altered with a foreign substance such as chewing tobacco. It was legal when his career began and outlawed in 1920, but {{he was one of}} 17 pitchers permitted to continue throwing the pitch.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> its rubber layer; it was {{designed}} to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E
50|$|The 1940s World War II Era <b>Ball</b> <b>was</b> first held in 2008. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> {{founded by}} Khyentse James, who {{previously}} founded the Decibelle Music and Culture Festival. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> created {{in honor of}} James' grandparents, who were radio performers and met while they were working at a radio station together in the 1940s.|$|R
50|$|Interesting {{situations}} {{could occur}} if somehow both <b>the</b> free <b>ball</b> and <b>the</b> real <b>ball</b> on <b>are</b> potted. If a colour <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> on (all reds were potted), and both <b>the</b> free <b>ball</b> and <b>the</b> actual <b>ball</b> on <b>are</b> potted, only <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> on <b>is</b> scored. <b>The</b> free <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> respotted while <b>the</b> actual <b>ball</b> on will {{stay off the}} table. This {{is the only time}} when attempting to pot a colour that two <b>balls</b> can <b>be</b> potted without a foul occurring, because technically speaking both of <b>the</b> potted <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> on.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} {{using a new}} design, {{consisting of}} eight thermally bonded, three-dimensional panels. These were spherically moulded from ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). The surface of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> textured with grooves, a technology developed by Adidas called GripnGroove that was intended to improve <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> aerodynamics. <b>The</b> design received considerable academic input, being developed in partnership with researchers from Loughborough University, United Kingdom. <b>The</b> <b>balls</b> <b>were</b> made in China, using latex bladders made in India, thermoplastic polyurethane-elastomer from Taiwan, ethylene vinyl acetate, isotropic polyester/cotton fabric, and glue and ink from China.|$|R
5|$|Handled <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> Law 33 in {{the laws}} of cricket {{established}} by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). A batsman can be given out for handling the ball if, while playing a delivery, the batsman intentionally touches the ball with {{one or both of}} their hands not holding the bat. A decision of not out must be reached if the batsman handles the ball to avoid incurring an injury. A bowler does not receive credit for the wicket when a batsman is dismissed in this fashion.|$|E
5|$|No player {{along the}} lane may enter the key until the shot is released; the player {{shooting}} the free throw, and anyone {{on top of}} the key, should not pass the free throw line until the ball hits the rim. If any of the offensive players violate the rule, no points are awarded for the shot and, if there are no more shots remaining, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> given to the defending team. If a defending player is in the lane too soon, an extra shot will be awarded regardless of whether the shot was made or missed.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} team must {{line up in}} a legal formation {{before they}} can snap the ball. An offensive formation is considered illegal if {{there are more than}} four players in the backfield or fewer than five players numbered 50–79 on the offensive line. Players can temporarily line up in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they immediately report the change to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change. Neither team's players, {{with the exception of the}} snapper, are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> snapped. Interior offensive linemen are not allowed to move until the snap of the ball.|$|E
5000|$|For the {{purposes}} of the rules, all players on the team in possession of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>are</b> attackers, and those on the team without <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>are</b> defenders, yet throughout the game being played you are always [...] "defending" [...] your goal and [...] "attacking" [...] the opposite goal.|$|R
50|$|Other {{devices to}} catch <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>are</b> not allowed.|$|R
5000|$|A fumble going out-of-bounds {{between the}} end zones is {{retained}} by the last team with possession (in Canadian football, the last team to touch <b>the</b> <b>ball).</b> If <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> moving backwards {{with regard to the}} recovering team, it is spotted where it went out of bounds. If <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> moving forwards, it is spotted where the fumble occurred (the fumble itself cannot advance <b>the</b> <b>ball).</b>|$|R
5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair catch kick. Because the defense is required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick, the kicker can take a running start before kicking {{as opposed to the}} typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap because <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> not snapped. The defense is not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage.|$|E
5|$|France {{hosted the}} 2007 World Cup, {{and the two}} teams met in the tournament quarter-finals. Despite France's hosting of the tournament, the match {{was held at the}} Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. The match was won by France 2018, and {{involved}} several controversial decisions by referee Wayne Barnes, who subsequently received death threats from some fans. France scored one try after the sin binning of All Blacks second five-eighth Luke McAlister, and another from a forward pass unseen by the referee. The All Blacks were strongly criticised for not attempting a drop goal in the game's final minutes. Their performance was analysed by Palmerston North based company Verusco who had analysed 1,500games since 2000. They discovered that the All Blacks made 57 tackles to France's 269, and they had 66 percent possession and 60 percent territory. The playing time, that is time <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> in play, was the longest of any game Verusco had ever recorded.|$|E
5|$|Homer, having {{forgotten}} Marge's birthday, rushes {{out to buy}} her {{a present}} at the Springfield Mall. He finds a bowling ball and decides to buy it for her. During the night of her birthday dinner at the Singing Sirloin, Marge is happy with the kids' presents of French perfume from Bart and a macaroni and glue card of her as the Mona Lisa from Lisa. However, she is offended by Homer's gift as it is another demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had reminded her of earlier. To make matters worse, as he presents his 'gift', it bursts through its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life, but <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> also inscribed with his name.|$|E
