5|$|Although not as {{significant}} as deforestation and hunting, some lemurs, such as crowned lemurs and other species that have successfully been kept in captivity, are occasionally kept as exotic pets by Malagasy people. Bamboo lemurs are also kept as pets, although they only survive for up <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b> Live capture for the exotic pet trade in wealthier countries is not normally considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export.|$|E

5|$|By 1943, the Allies {{had gained}} air superiority over Germany, and bombings of German cities and {{industry}} had become commonplace. However, the Allies in their strategic bombing campaign did not concentrate on industry, and Speer {{was able to}} overcome bombing losses. In spite of these losses, German production of tanks {{more than doubled in}} 1943, production of planes increased by 80 percent, and production time for Kriegsmarine submarines was reduced from one year <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b> Production would continue to increase until the second half of 1944.|$|E
5|$|In November 1907 {{six more}} {{families}} consisting of 27 individuals from Mingulay squatted on Sandray, {{which has a}} sheltered beach. Meanwhile, {{the plight of the}} Vatersay raiders had been raised at Westminster. Despite considerable public sympathy they were eventually sentenced <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> in prison. Shortly thereafter the Congested Districts Board purchased the entire island of Vatersay with the aim of providing new crofts. By the next summer there were 14 Mingulay families living there. Only six families remained on Mingulay itself, and all of them planned to leave.|$|E

5|$|Planula larvae exhibit {{positive}} phototaxis, swimming towards {{light to}} reach surface waters, where they drift and grow before descending {{to seek a}} hard surface to which they can attach and begin a new colony. They also exhibit positive sonotaxis, moving towards sounds that emanate from the reef and away from open water. High failure rates afflict many stages of this process, and even though millions of gametes are released by each colony, few new colonies form. The time from spawning to settling is usually two to three days, but can be up <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b> The larva grows into a polyp and eventually becomes a coral head by asexual budding and growth.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{deployment}} of the AIF a reinforcement system was used to replace wastage. Reinforcements received training in Australia before sailing as drafts and joining their assigned units at the front. To provide officer reinforcements, a series of AIF officer schools, such as that at Broadmeadows, were established in Australia before officer training was eventually concentrated at a school near Duntroon. These schools produced {{a large number of}} officers, but they were eventually closed in 1917 due to concerns that their graduates were too inexperienced and after this most replacement officers were drawn from the ranks of the AIF's deployed units, and candidates attended either British officer training units, or in-theatre schools established in France. After February 1916, the issue of NCO training was also taken more seriously, and several schools were established, with training initially being two weeks in duration before being increased <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gestational period varies among bovids - while duiker {{gestation}} {{ranges from}} 120 to 150 days, gestation in African buffalo ranges from 300 to 330 days. Usually, a single offspring is born (twins are less frequent), {{and it is}} able to stand and run by itself within an hour of birth. In monogamous species, males assist in defending their young, {{but that is not the}} case in polygynous species. Most newborn calves remain hidden for a week <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>months,</b> regularly nursed by their mothers. In some bovid species the neonates start following about their mothers immediately or within a few days, as in the impala. Different bovids have different strategies for defence of juveniles. For instance, while wildebeest mothers solely defend their young, buffaloes exhibit collective defence. Weaning might occur as early as two months (as in royal antelope) or as late as a year (as in muskox).|$|E

An agreement was inked with a top school in China, Beijing's The Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal University, in which classrooms will be leased. A total of four batches of students make their way to the campus every year, staying for up <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b> Priority is given to scholars of HCI's Bicultural Studies Programme and Humanities Programme. Students in the campus take lessons together with students from China in partner schools, carry out community involvement activities, and take field trips to cities such as Xi'an, Tianjin and Shanghai.|$|E
5|$|Most bovids are diurnal. Social {{activity}} and feeding usually peak during dawn and dusk. Bovids typically rest before dawn, during midday, and after dark. They have various methods of social organisation and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Bovids use {{different forms of}} vocal, olfactory, and tangible communication. Most species alternately feed and ruminate throughout the day. While small bovids forage in dense and closed habitat, larger species feed on high-fiber vegetation in open grasslands. Most bovids are polygynous. Mature bovids mate {{at least once a}} year and smaller species may even mate twice. In some species, neonate bovids remain hidden for a week <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>months,</b> regularly nursed by their mothers; in other species, neonates are followers, accompanying their dams, rather than tending to remain hidden.|$|E
5|$|Nursing lasts six {{to eight}} months in Californian populations and four to twelve months in Alaska, with the mother {{beginning}} to offer bits of prey at one <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b> The milk from a sea otter's two abdominal nipples is rich in fat and more similar to the milk of other marine mammals than {{to that of other}} mustelids. A pup, with guidance from its mother, practices swimming and diving for several weeks before it is able to reach the sea floor. Initially, the objects it retrieves are of little food value, such as brightly colored starfish and pebbles. Juveniles are typically independent at {{six to eight}} months, but a mother may be forced to abandon a pup if she cannot find enough food for it; at the other extreme, a pup may nurse until it is almost adult size. Pup mortality is high, particularly during an individual's first winter– by one estimate, only 25% of pups survive their first year. Pups born to experienced mothers have the highest survival rates.|$|E

5|$|Several {{sets were}} {{rendered}} digitally, {{and almost all}} of the sets had some form of digital enhancement. The largest digital environment was the Devetashka cave, which had to be digitally recreated because of the environmental concerns of filming explosions in the real cave. Using over 5,000 photographs taken at different times of day, the cave was accurately illuminated and rendered down to crevices and moss. The cave's interior containing a concealed nuclear vault was subjected to several changes up <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> before the effects' delivery date based on editorial input, including modifications to its scale. The railcar used within the cave was also digitally built alongside a practical version, but the digital versions versatility saw it largely replace its practical counterpart. The scene featuring the Expendables and prisoners trapped in the cave were shot entirely on Chroma key with the cave background inserted later.|$|E
5|$|Strong wind gusts downed nearly 1,500power {{lines and}} knocked over 28 large high tension wire towers at {{a power plant}} in Mariel. As a result, {{more than half of}} the {{electricity}} customers in Havana Province were left without power for 12days after the storm, and all of Pinar del Río Province was without power for over 11days. Blackouts continued in areas where power returned. The power outages resulted in lack of drinking water for numerous people, including no potable water in the city of Havana for four days. As a result, the Cuban government sent water tanks to satisfy the short term need. Similarly, there was a lack of gas for cooking for over a week. However, one Cuban government official stated that it could take up <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> for basic utilities to be returned to many isolated villages.|$|E
5|$|After a {{score of}} ten starts, two podiums, three other top six {{finishes}} and five retirements, Toivonen left Opel Team Europe for the 1984 season. He {{was linked to the}} lead drive at the Peugeot Talbot Sport, Peugeot's new factory World Rally Championship team, but eventually signed to drive a Porsche 911 SC RS for the Rothmans-sponsored Porsche factory team in the European Rally Championship. The team was run by Prodrive, a new motorsport group set up by David Richards, Toivonen's former boss at Opel. His European season with Porsche {{turned out to be a}} success. He started with two retirements, a third and a second place, but went on to win five rallies in a row and led the championship from Italian Lancia driver Carlo Capone. As Toivonen had a contract with Lancia for the World Rally Championship, and Lancia boss Cesare Fiorio wanted Capone to win the European title, it was suggested that Fiorio might enter Toivonen in WRC events to keep him away from important ERC rounds. However, Toivonen's title campaign ended in a back injury and a resulting enforced rest that was expected to take up <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b> He missed several events and finished second in the championship behind Capone.|$|E

5|$|In Bačka and Baranja, the Volksdeutsche and Hungarian {{authorities}} killed {{significant numbers}} of Serbs. After small-scale armed resistance broke out in Hungarian-occupied Bačka and Baranja {{in the second half}} of 1941, the Hungarian military reacted with heavy repressive measures. In September 1941 alone the Hungarian occupation forces summarily executed 313 people. Measures included the establishment of temporary concentration camps at Ada, Bačka Topola, Begeč, Odžaci, Bečej and Subotica, as well as at Novi Sad, Pechuj and Baja. According to Professor Paul Mojzes, some 2,000 Jews and a large number of Serbs were detained in these camps for periods from two weeks <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>months,</b> with Jews that had not been interned being employed as forced labourers. Several thousand people remained in camps until the end of the war. Some of the Jews that had migrated to Bačka and Baranja during the inter-war period were expelled to the NDH or the German-occupied territory of Serbia where they were killed. The communist-led Partisan resistance movement of Josip Broz Tito was never strong in Bačka and Baranja because the flat terrain of the region did not lend itself to guerilla warfare, and because South Slavs, from which the Partisans drew their recruits, only made up one-third of the regional population. Some Partisan units raised in the occupied territories were sent to the NDH to reinforce Partisan formations operating there. Despite their initial resistance, the Chetnik movement was largely inactive during the occupation, maintaining some covert activity only. The Partisans and their regional committee had largely been destroyed by the end of 1941.|$|E
5|$|Isotretinoin is an oral retinoid {{that is very}} {{effective}} for severe nodular acne, and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments. One <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4–6month course of oral isotretinoin. After a single course, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting complete remission. About 20% of patients require a second course. Although concerns have emerged that isotretinoin use is linked with {{an increased risk of}} adverse effects, like depression, suicidality, anemia, although there is no clear evidence to support some of these claims. Isotretinoin use in women of childbearing age is regulated due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy. For such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin, she must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control. In 2008, the United States started the iPLEDGE program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy. iPledge requires the woman under consideration for isotretinoin therapy to have two negative pregnancy tests and mandates the use of two types of birth control for at least one month before therapy begins and one month after therapy is complete. The effectiveness of the iPledge program has been questioned due to continued instances of contraception nonadherence.|$|E
