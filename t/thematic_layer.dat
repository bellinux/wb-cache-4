As far as the spatial conception is concerned, the residential area was clearly distinguished from the reception and study area. The scientist`s personal belongings, the original furniture are the part of this unusual ambient. The painted decoration on the walls and ceilings, the work of a young painter Dragutin Inkiostri Medenjak, a scientist`s good friend, represents the special value of the interior. The decoration was done in al secco technique. Reflecting the scientist`s interest for the area of Balkan Peninsula, the <b>thematic</b> <b>layer</b> of painting was inspired by the landscape of Bosnia, Šumadija and Herzegovina, which Cvijić particularly explored and scientifically approached. Born in Split in 1866, Inkiostri started as a self-thought painter, and then studied painting in Florence.

40|$|Implementing {{agricultural}} water management programs over appropriate spatial extents can have {{positive effects on}} water access and erosion management. Lack of access to water for domestic and agricultural uses represents a major constraint on agricultural productivity and perpetuates poverty and hunger in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This lack of access {{is the result of}} erratic precipitation, poor water management, limited knowledge of hydrological systems, and inadequate investment in water infrastructure. Water management programs should be made by multi-disciplinary teams that consider the interrelationship between hydraulic and anthropogenic factors. This paper proposes a method to prioritize watersheds for water management and agricultural development across Mali (Western Africa) using remote sensing data and GIS tools. The method involves deriving a set of relevant thematic layers from satellite imagery. Satellite images from Landsat ETM+ were used to generate thematic layers such as land use/land cover. Slope and drainage density maps were derived from Shuttle RADAR Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) at 90 m spatial resolution. Population grids were available from the Global rural-urban mapping project (GRUMP) database for the year 2000 and mean rainfall maps were extracted from Tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) grids for each year between 1988 and 2014. Each <b>thematic</b> <b>layer</b> was divided into classes that were assigned a rank for agriculture and livelihoods development provided by experts in the relevant field (e. g., Soil scientist ranking the soil classes) and published literature on those themes. Zones of priority were delineated based on the combination of high scoring ranks from each <b>thematic</b> <b>layer.</b> Five categories of priority zones ranging from “very high” to “very low” were determined based on total score percentages. Field verification was then undertaken in selected categories to check the priority assigned to each class using a random sampling method. Watershed boundaries were prepared at 1000 ha scale and overlaid on the priority map to identify watersheds that were in a very high priority zone. The importance and efficiency of using remote sensing to prioritize watershed interventions across countries is critical due to the limited technical and financial resources available in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) ...|$|E

It was one of the driest and water scarcest regions in the country. Groundwater potential zones are demarcated by integrating the highly impacting <b>thematic</b> <b>layers</b> such as land use, soil texture and depth, rainfall, slope, drainage density, lineament and geomorphology. The <b>thematic</b> <b>layers</b> are prepared from the remote sensing satellite images, ground truth data and available secondary data.
