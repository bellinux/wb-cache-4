25|$|An {{officer of}} the Santa Hermandad has a warrant for Quixote's arrest for freeing the galley-slaves. The priest begs for the officer to have mercy on account of Quixote’s insanity. The officer agrees, and Quixote is locked in a cage and made <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is an enchantment {{and that there is}} a prophecy of his heroic return home. While traveling, the group stops to eat and lets Quixote out of the cage, and he gets into a fight with a {{goatherd}} and with a group of pilgrims, who beat him into submission, and he is finally brought home. The narrator ends the story by saying that he has found manuscripts of Quixote's further adventures.|$|E
25|$|Such a {{phenomenon}} was observed, but not photographed, in the Owens Valley of California. Early {{in the morning}} with no wind, thin clouds were observed to form above the valley. The distinction was that they were created alternately and moved in opposite directions away from a central location on the valley floor, suggesting the existence of an inaudible free convection whistle. The reason for including this type of whistle is that we tend <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is necessary for a forced jet flow to encounter a solid material to create a whistle. Perhaps it would be more correct to generalize the concept to a particular impedance mismatch rather than a solid object. The Hartmann whistle and the jet screech fits into this generalization. The concept also applies to any fluid motion as opposed to a strictly forced flow.|$|E

500|$|The medieval {{churches of}} St Nicholas, Blakeney and St Margaret's, Cley, and the now ruined Blakeney friary, {{were not the}} first {{religious}} buildings in the area. An early church was recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book at Esnuterle ("Snitterley" [...] was a former name for Blakeney, the current name first appearing in 1340), but the 11th-century church's location is unknown, {{and there is no}} reason <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is on the site of the 'chapel'.|$|E
500|$|Dennis Feldman had {{the idea}} for Species in 1987, as he worked on another film about an alien invasion, Real Men. Having read an article by Arthur C. Clarke about the insurmountable odds against an {{extraterrestrial}} craft ever locating and visiting Earth, given that stellar distances are great, and faster-than-light travel is unlikely, Feldman started <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "unsophisticated for any alien culture to come here in what 'd describe as a big tin can." [...] Thus in turn he considered {{that the possibility of}} extraterrestrial contact was through information. Then he detailed that a message would contain instructions from across the void to build something that would talk to men. Instead of a mechanical device, Feldman imagined wetware. The visitor would adapt to Earth's environment through DNA belonging to Earth's organisms. Mankind has sent to space transmissions [...] "giving out directions" [...] such as the Arecibo message, which Feldman considered unwary, as they relay information to potential predators from outer space. He pointed out that [...] "in nature, one species would not want a predator to know where it hides." ...|$|E
500|$|Another popular {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's vision of goddess Annapurna of Varanasi. Ramprasad {{was on his way}} to the river for his daily ritual bath when a {{beautiful}} young woman stopped him, asking if she could hear him sing a devotional song to the Divine Mother. Ramprasad requested her to wait, since it was getting late for his noon worship. When he returned, he couldn't find her, and began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may have been the [...] "play of Divine Mother." [...] Sitting down to meditate, he was surrounded by a radiant light and heard a female voice saying, [...] "I am Annapurna (…) I came all the way from Varanasi to hear your songs but, alas, I had to leave disappointed." [...] Ramprasad was angry with himself and immediately left for Varanasi to find Mother Annapurna and sing for her. After walking many miles, he reached Triveni, where he took rest under a tree on the bank of the Ganges. Here he reportedly received another vision, saw the same mystical light, and heard the Mother's voice saying, [...] "Stay here and sing for me. (…) Varanasi is not the only place where I live; I pervade the whole universe." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2006 he {{reflected}} on his career saying [...] "Those {{who have been}} doing for this for 40 years would like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> a kind of Darwinian survival of the talented.

Not many people have the temperament to deal with that." ...|$|R
500|$|Darwin's {{position}} as a naturalist on board was as a self-funded guest with no official appointment, and he could leave the voyage at any suitable stage. At the outset George Peacock had advised that [...] "The Admiralty are not disposed to give a salary, though they will furnish you with an official appointment & every : if a salary should be required however I am inclined <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be granted". Far from wanting this, Darwin's concern was to maintain control over his collection. He was even reluctant {{to be on the}} Admiralty's books for [...] until he got assurances from FitzRoy and Beaufort that this would not affect his rights to assign his specimens. Darwin did not want his collection to go to the British Museum as he had heard that specimens from the first Beagle voyage were still waiting to be described. Beaufort assured him that he [...] "should have no difficulty" [...] as long as he [...] "presented them to some public body" [...] such as the Zoological or Geological societies. Darwin himself thought his new finds should go to the [...] "largest & most central collection", not the [...] Cambridge Philosophical Society museum that Henslow was setting up at Cambridge, but after getting Henslow's willing agreement to take delivery of the consignments of specimens, Darwin replied that he hoped to give some to the Cambridge museum.|$|E
500|$|According to Dunn, Willkie's {{mission was}} to be Roosevelt's {{personal}} representative, [...] "demonstrating American unity, gathering information, and discussing with key heads of state plans for the postwar future". After leaving the U.S. on August 26, Willkie's first stop was in North Africa, where he met General Montgomery and toured the front at El Alamein. In Beirut, he stayed with General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French. In Jerusalem, Willkie met with Jews and Arabs, told the British rulers of Palestine that both peoples should {{be brought into the}} government, and he later wrote that the conflict there was so ancient, it was unrealistic <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could [...] "be solved by good will and simple honesty". Willkie had been moved to add the Soviet Union to his itinerary when three Western reporters there urged him by telegram to do so. There, he met with Stalin, and upon his return he advocated more liberal Lend-Lease terms for the USSR. In China, Willkie was hosted by Chiang Kai-shek and was fascinated by Madame Chiang. Willkie was taken to the front in order to observe the Chinese military forces in their fight against the Japanese, and he spoke out against colonialism, in China and elsewhere. [...] His statements were reported widely in Britain, angering Churchill, who responded by saying, [...] "We mean to hold our own. I have not become the King's First Minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wuthering Heightss {{violence}} and passion led the Victorian public and many early reviewers <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{had been written}} by a man. According to Juliet Gardiner, [...] "the vivid sexual passion and power of its language and imagery impressed, bewildered and appalled reviewers." [...] Even though it received mixed reviews when it first came out, and was often condemned for its portrayal of amoral passion, the book subsequently became an English literary classic. Emily Brontë never knew the extent of fame she achieved with her only novel, as she died a year after its publication, aged 30.|$|E
2500|$|During her June 12, 2010, {{appearance}} on Freedom Watch, Palin elaborated on her stance {{that even though}} marijuana should not be legalized, enforcement of marijuana prohibition laws should be made a lower priority: [...] "Well, if we’re talking about pot, I’m not for the legalization of pot because I think that that would just encourage, especially, our young people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was okay {{to go ahead and}} use it. And I’m not an advocate for that. However, I {{think that we need to}} prioritize our law enforcement efforts. And if somebody’s gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody else any harm, then perhaps there are other things that our cops should be looking at to engage in and try to clean up some of the other problems that we have in society that are appropriate for law enforcement to do and not concentrate on such a, relatively speaking, minimal problem that we have in the country." ...|$|E

[...] he said. [...] "So, since I had recorded the first record by myself, playing all the instruments, but I wanted people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a group, I figured that FOO FIGHTERS might lead people to believe that it was more than just one guy.

50|$|Tat Wood and Lawrence Miles {{point out}} the {{theatrical}} influence on this story, drawing particular attention to Luigi Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, and that {{the point of the}} story is to lead the audience <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> a story about an alien presence infiltrating the TARDIS in order to pull off the twist that the ship is actually conscious.

2500|$|ERA {{generated}} {{nearly as}} much attention from legislators as the simultaneous consideration of the successful right-to-work law. Supporters of the amendment seemed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a foregone conclusion that Speaker Henry had {{found a way to}} get the amendment out of the previously [...] "obstructionist" [...] committee. Meanwhile, a small group of social conservatives, unknown to Henry or LeBlanc, was giving speeches in parts of the state where they sought to switch the votes of four Democratic representatives on the committee. These lawmakers were John W. [...] "Jock" [...] Scott of Alexandria, Michael F. [...] "Mike" [...] Thompson of Lafayette, Lane A. Carson of New Orleans, and A. J. McNamara of Metairie. It was believed that the Pentecostal Church, which opposed ERA and which was influential in Rapides Parish, convinced Scott to reverse his position. pro-life and anti-feminist groups in Lafayette and New Orleans, persuaded Thompson to oppose the ERA, and conservative women in Jefferson Parish pleaded with McNamara, later a Ronald W. Reagan-appointed U.S. district judge, to switch his vote as well.|$|E
2500|$|... 4. Following local custom/There is no fixed date line. According to Rabbi Menachem Mendel Kasher, {{there is}} no clear {{tradition}} or Talmudic source dictating any of the preceding opinions as binding. For that reason, and consistent with a responsum of the Radbaz, Rabbi Kasher starts with the default law that a Jew not knowing the proper day for Shabbat should count days from the last time s/he observed Shabbat, and that every seven days is Shabbat. In his view, established Jewish communities are presumed to have fixed their calendars according to this principle. Therefore, Shabbat in an established community is whatever day the community has established. Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer and Rabbi Zvi Pesach Frank apparently agree with this position. This position does not in and of itself require a formal date line to be established, and Rabbi Kasher does not seem <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is necessary to do so. But the de facto result of this position is consistent with the conventional International Date Line, at least anywhere there is an established Jewish community.|$|E
2500|$|The lyrical use of {{the word}} midons, {{borrowed}} from Guilhem de Poitou, allowed troubadours to address multiple listeners—the lords, men, and women of the court alike. A sort of hermaphroditic code word, or senhan, scholar Meg Bogin writes, the multiple meanings behind this term allowed a covert form of flattery: [...] "By refusing to disclose his lady's name, the troubadour permitted every woman in the audience, notably the patron's wife, <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was she; then, besides making her the object of a secret passion—it was always covert romance—by making her his lord he flashed her an aggrandized image of herself: she was more than 'just' a woman; she was a man." [...] These points of multiple meaning and ambiguity facilitated a [...] "coquetry of class", allowing the male troubadours to use the images of women as a means to gain social status with other men, but simultaneously, Bogin suggests, voiced deeper longings for the audience: [...] "In this way, the sexual expressed the social and the social the sexual; and in the poetry of courtly love the static hierarchy of feudalism was uprooted and transformed to express a world of motion and transformation." ...|$|E
