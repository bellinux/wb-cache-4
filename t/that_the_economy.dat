5|$|Along {{with the}} rising {{importance}} of a central administration arose {{a new class of}} educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E
5|$|Based on archaeological {{findings}} in the Middle East, in particular physical artifacts, textual references, inscriptions and wall paintings, it appears that Mycenaean Greeks achieved strong commercial and cultural interaction {{with most of the}} Bronze Age people living in this region: Canaanites, Kassites, Mitanni, Assyrians, and Egyptians. The 14th century Uluburun shipwreck, off the coast of southern Anatolia, displays the established trade routes that supplied the Mycenaeans with all the raw materials and items <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> of Mycenaean Greece needed, such as copper and tin for the production of bronze products.

5|$|The {{developments}} in Uruguay were closely watched by the Empire of Brazil, which had vital {{interests in the}} Río de la Plata Basin. After Rosas fell in 1852, Brazil became the dominant regional power. Its foreign policy included the covert underwriting of opposition parties in Uruguay and Argentina, preventing strong governments that might threaten Brazil's strategic position in the area. Brazilian banking and commercial firms also had ventures in the area, furthering ties within the region. In Uruguay, the bank run by Irineu Evangelista de Sousa (Baron and later Viscount of Mauá) became so heavily involved in commercial enterprises <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> depended on this source of continued capital flow.|$|E

He listed eighteen such crops. He further argued that these introductions, along with an increased mechanization of agriculture and irrigation, led to major changes in economy, population distribution, vegetation cover, agricultural production and income, population, urban growth, distribution of the labour force, industries linked to agriculture, cooking, diet and clothing in the Islamic world.|$|E

5|$|The Lincoln-Liberty Building, {{completed}} in 1932, {{was intended to}} partly house a large men's department store and offices. The building's cornerstone was set on October 1, 1932 with a ceremony attended by William L. Nevin and Wanamaker executives from New York City, Paris and London. The Wanamaker Men's Store opened on October 12, 1932, with four Wanamaker buglers blowing a reveille and the ringing of the building's Founders Bell. Opening during the Great Depression, Nevin said the new building {{was a sign of}} the store's faith <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> would improve. Intended to rival European department stores in size and selection, the men's store ordered US$2,000,000 worth of merchandise and was the largest store {{of its kind in the}} world. As early as 1939 there were rumors the men's store would close, but Wanamaker's would not close the store unless a replacement tenant would agree to rent the space. When a new tenant was ready to take the store's place in the 1950s, the men's store was relocated to the Wanamaker Building down the street.|$|E

External shocks have low effects on domestic variables but they are increasing over time. Given that real exchange rate reacts stronger to real economy but lower to its own shock, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>economies</b> tend to experience real depreciation and lower volatility in inflation in the post-crisis period, the results imply more effective policy and greater role of exchange rate to act as a shock absorber under floating exchange rate regimes aftermath the crisis. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} industry is commonly {{believed to have}} slow growth in labour productivity. This belief {{is partly due to}} the labour intensive nature of the construction process and partly due to the inherent difficulty the industry has in adopting labour saving technologies such as the production line technique due to the one-off nature of construction projects. The ‘fragmented’ structure of the industry and its apparent stagnant technological progress further strengthens this belief. However, on the other hand, it can also be argued that a ‘fragmented’ structure facilitates the division of labour and therefore enhances the productive efficiency of labour. Furthermore, the labour intensive nature of the construction process simply means that output (in value added terms) per unit of labour, at any point in time, is likely to be lower than <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> This however does not necessarily imply that growth in labour productivity in the {{construction industry}} over time will be also lower than <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> Whether labour productivity growth in the construction industry compares favourably with <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> is purely an empirical question which this paper attempts to investigate. It presents a simple method of estimating the relative labour productivity (RLP) trend of the construction industry (labour productivity of the construction industry relative to <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>economy)</b> from national accounting data. The method is then used to derive the trend of RLP in Hong Kong's construction industry. The results do not support <b>the</b> common belief <b>that</b> labour productivity in the construction industry grows at a slower rate compared with <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> <b>economy...</b>|$|R
