30|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the role of}} occupational human capital in determining the earnings losses after job displacement; in particular, {{the degree to which}} occupation-specific skills are transferable across occupations depends on the similarity between two given occupations. The key finding of this paper is that occupational human capital, and more specifically skills <b>transferability</b> <b>between</b> occupations, is an important determinant of changes in weekly earnings following displacement. In particular, the ordinary least square (OLS) estimates present that, on average, 10 additional units of skills <b>transferability</b> <b>between</b> pre- and post-displacement occupations lowers earning losses by 3.6 percentage points ceteris paribus. It implies that the degree of similarity between pre- and post-displacement occupations has a strong effect on how displaced workers will suffer from earnings losses both in terms of significance and the magnitude of the effect. This goes beyond the usual finding from most of the previous studies using the dichotomous “change-in-occupation” variable. In addition, the relationship <b>between</b> occupational skills <b>transferability</b> and earnings losses are not linear: a higher degree of skills transferability lowers earnings losses, but the decline attenuates as skills transferability increases. Moreover, the results from the further analysis show a strong and positive relationship between the degree of occupational similarity and the pre-displacement earnings.|$|R

This paper, for instance, demonstrated that this approach yielded {{the highest rate of}} <b>transferability</b> <b>between</b> sales occupations and food preparation vocations. It is far more likely that this estimate is simply the result of higher turnover within the secondary labor market and, thus, represents an inadequate measure – by itself – of OSHC transferability.|$|R

40|$|AbstractNetwork safety ranking (or hotspot identification) is {{conducted}} {{in order to}} identify hazardous road locations and develop a priority list for application of effective safety treatments. In this process empirical Bayes approach, using accident prediction models, has been recommended. In order to be conducted efficiently, several questions need to be answered: for example which model function form should be adopted; which explanatory variables need to be collected and included in model; which time period is to be used. There is also a question whether each region requires its specific model or whether a transfer from elsewhere is feasible. These decision points motivated the presented study, which was conducted with data from national road network in two adjacent regions in the southeast of the Czech Republic (South Moravian region and Zlín region). For the purpose of network safety ranking, separate accident prediction models have been developed and applied in both regions. Several analysis steps were conducted in order to compare the model quality and performance, as well as both temporal <b>transferability</b> (<b>between</b> various periods) and spatial <b>transferability</b> (<b>between</b> the regions). The idea was to develop a transferable model, which would ease up on demands on data collection and modelling efforts and would thus increase effectiveness of the network safety ranking process.

30|$|The {{paper by}} Eaton [31] proposes {{to build a}} target learner based on a {{transferability}} measure from multiple related source domains. The approach first builds a logistic regression learner for each source domain. Next, a model transfer graph is constructed to represent the <b>transferability</b> <b>between</b> each source learner. In this case, transferability from a first learner to a second learner {{is defined as the}} performance of the second learner with learning from the first learner minus the performance of the second learner without learning from the first learner. Next, the model transfer graph is modified by adding the <b>transferability</b> measures <b>between</b> the target learner and all the source learners. Using spectral graph theory [17] on the model transfer graph, a transfer function is derived that maintains the geometry of the model transfer graph and is used in the final target learner to determine the level of transfer from each source. Experiments are performed in the applications of document classification and alphabet classification. Source domains are identified that are either related or unrelated to the target domain. The method by Eaton [31] is tested along with a handpicked method where the source domains are manually selected {{to be related to the}} target, an average method that uses all sources available, and a baseline method that does not use transfer learning. Classification accuracy is the performance metric measured in the experiments. The source and target domains are represented by a homogeneous feature input space. The results of the experiments are mixed. Overall, the Eaton [31] approach performs the best; however, there are certain instances where Eaton [31] performed worse than the handpicked, average, and baseline methods. In the implementation of the algorithm, the <b>transferability</b> measure <b>between</b> two sources is required to be the same; however, the transferability from source 1 to source 2 is not always equal to the transferability from source 2 to source 1. A suggestion for future improvement is to use directed graphs to specify the bidirectional nature of the <b>transferability</b> measure <b>between</b> two sources.|$|R

If the business cycle generates structural changes which force individuals to switch careers, there is a risk attached to investments in specific skills. Relatedly, technological changes could create an advantage for general skills if they enhance the ability to learn new skills. Employers could be more likely to offer further training to these individuals, who then become even less sensitive to changes. In sum, the long-run relative earnings implications are ambiguous, and the time frame emerges as an important aspect to appropriately analyze the impact of general vs. specific skills.|$|R
