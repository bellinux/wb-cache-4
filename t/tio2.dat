5|$|A {{variety of}} reduced oxides of {{titanium}} are known. Ti3O5, {{described as a}} Ti(IV)-Ti(III) species, is a purple semiconductor produced by reduction of <b>TiO2</b> with hydrogen at high temperatures,O5 Powder|journal=Journal of Inorganic Materials|date=26 June 2013|volume=28|issue=4|pages=425–430|doi=10.3724/SP.J.1077.2013.12309|language=Chinese}} and is used industrially when surfaces need to be vapour-coated with titanium dioxide: it evaporates as pure TiO, whereas <b>TiO2</b> evaporates as a mixture of oxides and deposits coatings with variable refractive index. Also known is Ti2O3, with the corundum structure, and TiO, with the rock salt structure, although often nonstoichiometric.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen is {{employed}} to saturate broken ("dangling") bonds of amorphous silicon and amorphous carbon that helps stabilizing material properties. It {{is also a}} potential electron donor in various oxide materials, including ZnO, SnO2, CdO, MgO, ZrO2, HfO2, La2O3, Y2O3, <b>TiO2,</b> SrTiO3, LaAlO3, SiO2, Al2O3, ZrSiO4, HfSiO4, and SrZrO3.|$|E
5|$|The alkoxides of titanium(IV), {{prepared}} by reacting TiCl4 with alcohols, are colourless compounds that convert to the dioxide on reaction with water. They are industrially useful for depositing solid <b>TiO2</b> via the sol-gel process. Titanium isopropoxide {{is used in}} the synthesis of chiral organic compounds via the Sharpless epoxidation.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} oxide is <b>TiO2,</b> which exists in three important polymorphs; anatase, brookite, and rutile. All {{of these are}} white diamagnetic solids, although mineral samples can appear dark (see rutile). They adopt polymeric structures in which Ti is surrounded by six oxide ligands that link to other Ti centers.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{tetrachloride}} (TiCl4), a colorless liquid, {{is important}} {{as an intermediate}} {{in the process of}} making <b>TiO2</b> and is also used to produce the Ziegler–Natta catalyst. Titanium tetrachloride is also used to iridize glass and, because it fumes strongly in moist air, it is used to make smoke screens.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} only {{for the first three}} members of the group. The chemistry of rutherfordium is not very established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. All the elements of the group are reactive metals with a high melting point (1668°C, 1855°C, 2233°C, 2100°C?). The reactivity is not always obvious due to the rapid formation of a stable oxide layer, which prevents further reactions. The oxides <b>TiO2,</b> ZrO2 and HfO2 are white solids with high melting points and unreactive against most acids.|$|E
5|$|The most {{noteworthy}} {{reaction of}} TiCl4 is its easy hydrolysis, signaled by {{the release of}} hydrogen chloride {{and the formation of}} titanium oxides and oxychlorides, as described above for the production of <b>TiO2.</b> Titanium tetrachloride has been used to create naval smokescreens. The hydrogen chloride immediately absorbs water to form an aerosol of hydrochloric acid that efficiently scatter light. In addition, the highly refractive titanium dioxide is also an efficient light scatterer. This smoke is however corrosive.|$|E
5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% <b>TiO2,</b> are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic single {{crystals}} {{and films}} of <b>TiO2</b> {{are used as}} a semiconductor, and also in Bragg-stack style dielectric mirrors owing to the high refractive index of <b>TiO2</b> (2.5–2.9).|$|E
25|$|Noxer, a {{building}} material incorporating <b>TiO2.</b>|$|E
25|$|CAMP {{lava flows}} of North America can be geochemically {{separated}} in three units: {{the older ones}} are classified as high titanium quartz normative (HTQ) basalts (<b>TiO2</b> = 1.0-1.3nbsp&wt%); these are followed by lava flows classified as low titanium quartz normative (LTQ) basalts (<b>TiO2</b> = ca. 0.8-1.3nbsp&wt%); {{and then by the}} youngest lava flow unit classified as high titanium iron quartz normative (HTIQ) basalts (<b>TiO2</b> = 1.4-1.6nbsp&wt%). According to , geochemical analyses based upon titanium, magnesium and silicon contents show a certain correlation between the lower North American lava flows and the Lower Unit of the Moroccan CAMP, thus reinforcing the conclusion that the Moroccan basalts postdate the Tr-J boundary.|$|E
25|$|Thus {{there is}} reason to believe that ophiolites are indeed oceanic mantle and crust; however, certain {{problems}} arise when looking closer. Compositional differences regarding silica (SiO2) and titania (<b>TiO2)</b> contents, for example, place ophiolite basalts in the domain of subduction zones (~55% silica, <1% <b>TiO2),</b> whereas mid-ocean ridge basalts typically have ~50% silica and 1.5-2.5% <b>TiO2.</b> These chemical differences extend to a range of trace elements as well (that is, chemical elements occurring in amounts of 1000 ppm or less). In particular, trace elements associated with subduction zone (island arc) volcanics tend to be high in ophiolites, whereas trace elements that are high in ocean ridge basalts but low in subduction zone volcanics are also low in ophiolites.|$|E
25|$|Both anatase and rutile <b>TiO2</b> can intercalate cations, {{acting as}} anode {{material}} in Li-ion batteries and Na-ion batteries.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{significant}} ionic and electronic conduction of <b>TiO2,</b> it is potent {{to be used}} as the mixed conductor.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{cited in}} HP's initial reports on their <b>TiO2</b> memristor, the {{resistance}} switching characteristics of titanium dioxide were originally {{described in the}} 1960s.|$|E
25|$|In comparison, the {{injection}} process {{used in the}} DSSC does not introduce {{a hole in the}} <b>TiO2,</b> only an extra electron. Although it is energetically possible for the electron to recombine back into the dye, the rate at which this occurs is quite slow compared to the rate that the dye regains an electron from the surrounding electrolyte. Recombination directly from the <b>TiO2</b> to species in the electrolyte is also possible although, again, for optimized devices this reaction is rather slow. On the contrary, electron transfer from the platinum coated electrode to species in the electrolyte is necessarily very fast.|$|E
25|$|When the V2O5 {{is used as}} an {{intimate}} mixture with carbon, the synthesis proceeds at 200–400°C; {{in this case the}} carbon serves as a deoxygenation agent akin to its use in the Kroll process for the manufacturing of TiCl4 from <b>TiO2.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although the dye {{is highly}} {{efficient}} at converting absorbed photons into free electrons in the <b>TiO2,</b> only photons {{absorbed by the}} dye ultimately produce current. The rate of photon absorption depends upon the absorption spectrum of the sensitized <b>TiO2</b> layer and upon the solar flux spectrum. The overlap between these two spectra determines the maximum possible photocurrent. Typically used dye molecules generally have poorer absorption in the red part of the spectrum compared to silicon, which means that fewer of the photons in sunlight are usable for current generation. These factors limit the current generated by a DSSC, for comparison, a traditional silicon-based solar cell offers about 35 mA/cm2, whereas current DSSCs offer about 20 mA/cm2.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, highly {{photocatalytic}} active titania/tungsten (VI) oxide/noble metal (Au and Pt) composites toward {{oxalic acid}} {{were obtained by}} the means of selective noble metal photodeposition on the desired oxide's surface (either on <b>TiO2</b> or on WO3). The composite showed a modest hydrogen production performance.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have found}} that using dyes {{comprising}} a perylenemonoimid (PMI) as the acceptor and an oligothiophene coupled to triphenylamine as the donor greatly improve the performance of p-DSC by reducing charge recombination rate following dye-sensitized hole injection. The researchers constructed a tandem DSC device with NiO on the p-DSC side and <b>TiO2</b> on the n-DSC side. Photocurrent matching was achieved through adjustment of NiO and <b>TiO2</b> film thicknesses to control the optical absorptions and therefore match the photocurrents of both electrodes. The energy conversion efficiency of the device is 1.91%, which exceeds the efficiency of its individual components, but is still much {{lower than that of}} high performance n-DSC devices (6%–11%). The results are still promising since the tandem DSC was in itself rudimentary. The dramatic improvement in performance in p-DSC can eventually lead to tandem devices with much greater efficiency than lone n-DSCs.|$|E
25|$|DSSCs {{are still}} {{at the start of}} their {{development}} cycle. Efficiency gains are possible and have recently started more widespread study. These include the use of quantum dots for conversion of higher-energy (higher frequency) light into multiple electrons, using solid-state electrolytes for better temperature response, and changing the doping of the <b>TiO2</b> to better match it with the electrolyte being used.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the dye {{molecule}} has lost an electron and the molecule will decompose if another electron is not provided. The dye strips one from iodide in electrolyte below the <b>TiO2,</b> oxidizing it into triiodide. This reaction occurs quite quickly {{compared to the}} time that it takes for the injected electron to recombine with the oxidized {{dye molecule}}, preventing this recombination reaction that would effectively short-circuit the solar cell.|$|E
25|$|Depleted {{uranium dioxide}} can be also {{used as a}} catalyst, e.g. for {{degradation}} of volatile organic compounds in gaseous phase, oxidation of methane to methanol, and removal of sulfur from petroleum. It has high efficiency and long-term stability when used to destroy VOCs when compared {{with some of the}} commercial catalysts, such as precious metals, <b>TiO2,</b> and Co3O4 catalysts. Much research is being done in this area, DU being favoured for the uranium component due to its low radioactivity.|$|E
25|$|High-speed {{spinning}} {{processes for}} {{the manufacture of}} POY normally need a viscosity of 0.62–0.64 dℓ/g. Starting from bottle flakes, the viscosity can be set via the degree of drying. The additional use of <b>TiO2</b> is necessary for full dull or semi dull yarn. In {{order to protect the}} spinnerets, an efficient filtration of the melt is, in any case is necessary. For the time-being, the amount of POY made of 100% recycling polyester is rather low because this process requires high purity of spinning melt. Most of the time, a blend of virgin and recycled pellets is used.|$|E
25|$|In DSSC, {{electrodes}} {{consisted of}} sintered semiconducting nanoparticles, mainly <b>TiO2</b> or ZnO. These nanoparticle DSSCs rely on trap-limited diffusion through the semiconductor nanoparticles for the electron transport. This limits the device efficiency {{since it is}} a slow transport mechanism. Recombination {{is more likely to}} occur at longer wavelengths of radiation. Moreover, sintering of nanoparticles requires a high temperature of about 450°C, which restricts the fabrication of these cells to robust, rigid solid substrates. It has been proven that there is an increase in the efficiency of DSSC, if the sintered nanoparticle electrode is replaced by a specially designed electrode possessing an exotic 'nanoplant-like' morphology.|$|E
25|$|Nanoparticles of {{different}} materials have shown skin’s permeability limitations. In many experiments, gold nanoparticles 40nm in diameter or smaller are used and have shown to penetrate to the epidermis. Titanium oxide (<b>TiO2),</b> zinc oxide (ZnO), and silver nanoparticles are ineffective in penetrating the skin past the stratum corneum. Cadmium selenide (CdSe) quantum dots {{have proven to}} penetrate very effectively when they have certain properties. Because CdSe is toxic to living organisms, the particle must be covered in a surface group. An experiment comparing the permeability of quantum dots coated in polyethylene glycol (PEG), PEG-amine, and carboxylic acid concluded the PEG and PEG-amine surface groups allowed for the greatest penetration of particles. The carboxylic acid coated particles did not penetrate past the stratum corneum.|$|E
25|$|Nanoparticle-Assisted PCR (nanoPCR): In recent years, it {{has been}} {{reported}} that some nanoparticles (NPs) can enhance the efficiency of PCR (thus being called nanoPCR), and some even perform better than the original PCR enhancers. It was also found that quantum dots (QDs) can improve PCR specificity and efficiency. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are efficient in enhancing the amplification of long PCR. Carbon nanopowder (CNP) was reported be able to improve the efficiency of repeated PCR and long PCR. ZnO, <b>TiO2,</b> and Ag NPs were also found to increase PCR yield. Importantly, already known data has indicated that non-metallic NPs retained acceptable amplification fidelity. Given that many NPs are capable of enhancing PCR efficiency, it is clear that there is likely to be great potential for nanoPCR technology improvements and product development.|$|E
25|$|Rutile is {{the second}} most {{abundant}} mineral sand. Rutile found in primary rock cannot be extracted hence the deposits containing rutile sand can be mined meaning a reduced availability to the high concentration ore. Crude titanium dioxide (in the form of rutile or synthetic rutile) is purified via converting to titanium tetrachloride in the chloride process. In this process, the crude ore (containing at least 70% <b>TiO2)</b> is reduced with carbon, oxidized with chlorine to give titanium tetrachloride; i.e., carbothermal chlorination. This titanium tetrachloride is distilled, and re-oxidized in a pure oxygen flame or plasma at 1500–2000K to give pure titanium dioxide while also regenerating chlorine. Aluminium chloride is often added to the process as a rutile promotor; the product is mostly anatase in its absence. The preferred raw material for the chloride process is natural rutile because of its high titanium dioxide content.|$|E
25|$|White Portland cement {{or white}} {{ordinary}} Portland cement (WOPC) {{is similar to}} ordinary, grey, Portland cement in all respects, except for its high degree of whiteness. Obtaining this colour requires high purity raw materials (low Fe2O3 content), and some modification to the method of manufacture, a.o. a higher kiln temperature required to sinter the clinker {{in the absence of}} ferric oxides acting as a flux in normal clinker. As Fe2O3 contributes to decrease the melting point of the clinker (normally 1450°C), the white cement requires a higher sintering temperature (around 1600°C). Because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the grey product. The main requirement is to have a low iron content which should be less than 0.5wt.% expressed as Fe2O3 for white cement, and less than 0.9wt.% for off-white cement. It also helps to have the iron oxide as ferrous oxide (FeO) which is obtained via slightly reducing conditions in the kiln, i.e., operating with zero excess oxygen at the kiln exit. This gives the clinker and cement a green tinge. Other metallic oxides such as Cr2O3 (green), MnO (pink), <b>TiO2</b> (white), etc., in trace content, can also give colour tinges, so for a given project it is best to use cement from a single batch.|$|E

This material, an impure form of <b>TiO2,</b> is derived from ilmenite by removal of iron, either using carbon reduction or extraction with sulfuric acid. Crude TiCl4 contains {{a variety of other}} volatile halides, including vanadyl chloride (VOCl3), silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4), and tin tetrachloride (SnCl4), which must be separated.|$|E
500|$|Titanium {{tetrachloride}} is the {{inorganic compound}} with the formula TiCl4. It {{is an important}} intermediate {{in the production of}} titanium metal and the pigment titanium dioxide. TiCl4 is an unusual example of a metal halide that is highly volatile. Upon contact with humid air, it forms spectacular opaque clouds of titanium dioxide (<b>TiO2)</b> and hydrogen chloride (HCl). It is sometimes referred to as [...] "tickle" [...] due to the phonetic resemblance of its molecular formula (TiCl4) to the word.|$|E
500|$|The {{potential}} of X-ray crystallography {{for determining the}} structure of molecules and minerals—then only known vaguely from chemical and hydrodynamic experiments—was realized immediately. The earliest structures were simple inorganic crystals and minerals, but even these revealed fundamental laws of physics and chemistry. The first atomic-resolution structure to be [...] "solved" [...] (i.e., determined) in 1914 was that of table salt. The distribution of electrons in the table-salt structure showed that crystals are not necessarily composed of covalently bonded molecules, and proved the existence of ionic compounds. The structure of diamond was solved in the same year, proving the tetrahedral arrangement of its chemical bonds and showing that the length of C–C single bond was 1.52 angstroms. Other early structures included copper, calcium fluoride (CaF2, also known as fluorite), calcite (CaCO3) and pyrite (FeS2) in 1914; spinel (MgAl2O4) in 1915; the rutile and anatase forms of titanium dioxide (<b>TiO2)</b> in 1916; pyrochroite Mn(OH)2 and, by extension, brucite Mg(OH)2 in 1919;. Also in 1919 sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and caesium dichloroiodide (CsICl2) were determined by Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff, and the wurtzite (hexagonal ZnS) structure became known in 1920.|$|E
