30|$|In parallel, to {{investigate}} the effect of waste glass powder on the ASR expansion of cementitious composite bars, pH values in pore solution of cementitious composite were also measured by solid–liquid extraction method (Cyr et al. 2010). The extraction of the pore solution of small pieces of hardened cement mortar under hydraulic pressure {{is the most common}} technique for acquiring pore solution for further analysis including pH measurements (Cyr et al. 2010; Jr and Diamond 1981; Plusquellec et al. 2017). The pore fluid expression device consists of a hollow steel cylinder in which cement mortar specimens are located, a steel piston which is located {{on the top of the}} specimen inside the hollow steel cylinder and a steel base plate which has few drainage channels for collecting the extracted cementitious composites pore solution. In terms of pH measurement after extracting the concrete pore solution, pH values using a commercial pH electrode or determining hydroxide ion concentrations can be used for calculating the pH value (Pavlı́K 2000). Before each extraction test, all surfaces of the device were cleaned by ethanol at least twice until no residue remained. An approximately 6  mm-thick <b>Teflon</b> <b>seal</b> was inserted between the top of the specimen and the bottom surface of the piston to reduce the damage to the piston and reduce the friction between cement mortar specimens and piston by facilitating transfer of the applied pressure to the specimens. The loading rate for extraction was about 1 – 2.8  MPa/s until the maximum 550  MPa stress was achieved. To eliminate residual particles, the collected solution was filtered as soon as possible using filter paper with pore size of 0.45  μm. Then the pH of the pore solution was determined using a precision pH meter. All the liquid specimens were sealed to minimize any carbonation or oxidation.|$|E

40|$|Nine {{years ago}} we {{designed}} the prototype of a microperfusion pump for calibrated perfusions of tubular segments in vivo(l). The apparatus consists, in principle, of a metal pin whiclh is driven into the fluid-filled shaft of a micropipet. Since the base of this pipet is sealed, the fluid may escape with a constant flow rate only through {{the tip of the}} capillary. In the meantime many improvements were developed both in the apparatus and in the perfusion technique. I should like to start this review with a brief description of new details in the equipment. Formerly the pump was driven by an electric synchronous motor and the pump rate was adjusted by regulating the speed of the motor. This resulted in a reliable reproducibility of the pumping rate. However, the constancy of perfusion rate was dependent on a highly stable electric power supply. Furthermore, calibration of the pump was somewhat troublesome since it had a sigma-shaped calibration curve with only a relatively short region in which the pumping rate could be precisely established (Fig. 1). In the new system, constancy of perfusion rate is stabilized by a self-regulating electronic device. Because the calibration curve has a linear characteristic, the calibration procedure is simplified. The new apparatus was built by V. Roslicek and Wolfgang Hampel, the engineer who previouisly had helped us to develop the first type of microperfusion equipment. The new principle is depicted schematically in Fig. 2. In spite of the great advantages whlich the new apparatus provide, it should be emphasized that the most frequent pitfalls encountered with the microperfusion pump remain the same. The most critical point is the careful mounting of the microcapillary to the pump. When the base of the glass capillary does not exactly fit into the <b>Teflon</b> <b>seal</b> around the forward-moving metal pin, then the fluid displaced by the pin does not quantitatively escape througlh the tip of th...|$|E

In first stage, total lipids were extracted with 1 : 3 chloroform/methanol (CHCl 3 :CH 3 OH) and then followed by n-hexane. Solvents were evaporated under vacuum to collect and quantify lipid on weight basis. Estimation of sugar (xylose in prehydrolysate) during cell biomass generation and lipid maturation was quantified by High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (UFLC, Shimadzu, Japan) with PL Hiplex-H acid 8  μm column (100 [*]×[*] 7.7  mm diameter, by PL Polymer laboratory, UK).

40|$|Ground crew {{veterans}} at Kennedy Space Center {{still talk}} about what they call "the summer of hydrogen"-the long, frustrating months in 1990 when the shuttle fleet was grounded by an elusive hydrogen leak that foiled our efforts to fill the orbiter's external fuel tank. Columbia (STS- 35) was on Launch Pad A for a scheduled May 30 launch when we discovered the hydrogen leak during - tanking. The external fuel tank is loaded through the orbiter. Liquid hydrogen flows through a 17 -inch umbilical between the orbiter and the tank. During fueling, we purge the aft fuselage with gaseous nitrogen {{to reduce the risk of}} fire, and we have a leak-detection system in the mobile launch platform, which samples (via tygon tubing) the atmosphere in and around the vehicle, drawing it down to a mass spectrometer that analyzes its composition. When we progressed to the stage of tanking where liquid hydrogen flows through the vehicle, the concentration of hydrogen approached four percent-the limit above which it would be dangerously flammable. We had a leak. We did everything we could think of to find it, and the contractor who supplied the flight hardware was there every day, working alongside us. We did tanking tests, which involved instrumenting the suspected leak sources, and cryo-loaded the external tank to try to isolate precisely where the leak originated. We switched out umbilicals; we replaced the seals between the umbilical and the orbiter. We inspected the seals microscopically and found no flaws. We replaced the recirculation pumps, and we found and replaced a damaged <b>teflon</b> <b>seal</b> in a main propulsion system detent cover, which holds the prevalve-the main valve supplying hydrogen to Space Shuttle Main Engine 3 -in the open position. The seal passed leak tests at ambient temperature but leaked when cryogenic temperatures were applied. We added new leak sensors-up to twenty at a time and tried to be methodical in our placements to narrow down the possible sources of the problem. We even switched orbiters, sending Columbia back to the Vehicle Assembly Building and bringing out Atlantis, scheduled to fly as STS- 38. Two shuttles on their mobile launchers passing in the night was a majestic sight, but not one you want to see if you're trying to get an orbiter launched.

All these chemicals were loaded at room temperature in a <b>Teflon</b> <b>sealed</b> tube and the reaction mixture heated at 100 degrees C. The effects of CdCl 2 /thiourea/MPA feed molar ratios, pH, and concentrations of precursors affecting {{the growth of the}} CdS QDs, was monitored via the temporal evolution of the optical properties of the CdS nanocrystals. High concentration of precursors and high MPA/Cd feed molar ratios were found to lead to an increase in the diameter of the resulting CdS nanocrystals and of the trap state emission of the dots. The combination of moderate pH value, low concentration of precursors and slow growth rate plays the crucial role in the good optical properties of the obtained CdS nanocrystals. The highest photoluminescence achieved for CdS@MPA QDs of average size 3. 5 nm was 20 %. As prepared colloids show rather narrow particle size distribution, although all reactants were mixed at room temperature. CdS@MPA QDs were characterized by UV-vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry and MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. This noninjection one-pot approach features easy handling and large-scale production with excellent synthetic reproducibility. Surface passivation of CdS@MPA cores by a wider bandgap material, ZnS, led to enhanced luminescence intensity.

40|$|We {{present a}} sample {{handling}} system, a subsystem {{of the proposed}} Dragon landed Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission [1], that can return to Earth orbit a significant mass of frozen Mars samples potentially consisting of: rock cores, subsurface drilled rock and ice cuttings, pebble sized rocks, and soil scoops. The sample collection, storage, retrieval and packaging assumptions and concepts {{in this study are}} applicable for the NASA's MPPG MSR mission architecture options [2]. Our study assumes a predecessor rover mission collects samples for return to Earth to address questions on: past life, climate change, water history, age dating, understanding Mars interior evolution [3], and, human safety and in-situ resource utilization. Hence the rover will have "integrated priorities for rock sampling" [3] that cover collection of subaqueous or hydrothermal sediments, low-temperature fluidaltered rocks, unaltered igneous rocks, regolith and atmosphere samples. Samples could include: drilled rock cores, alluvial and fluvial deposits, subsurface ice and soils, clays, sulfates, salts including perchlorates, aeolian deposits, and concretions. Thus samples will have a broad range of bulk densities, and require for Earth based analysis where practical: in-situ characterization, management of degradation such as perchlorate deliquescence and volatile release, and contamination management. We propose to adopt a sample container with a set of cups each with a sample from a specific location. We considered two sample cups sizes: (1) a small cup sized for samples matching those submitted to in-situ characterization instruments, and, (2) a larger cup for 100 mm rock cores [4] and pebble sized rocks, thus providing diverse samples and optimizing the MSR sample mass payload fraction for a given payload volume. We minimize sample degradation by keeping them frozen in the MSR payload sample canister using Peltier chip cooling. The cups are sealed by interference fitted heat activated memory alloy caps [5] if the heating does not affect the sample, or by crimping caps similar to bottle capping. We prefer cap sealing surfaces be external to the cup rim to prevent sample dust inside the cups interfering with sealing, or, contamination of the sample by <b>Teflon</b> <b>seal</b> elements (if adopted). Finally the sample collection rover, or a Fetch rover, selects cups with best choice samples and loads them into a sample tray, before delivering it to the Earth Return Vehicle (ERV) in the MSR Dragon capsule as described in [1] (Fig 1). This ensures best use of the MSR payload mass allowance. A 3 meter long jointed robot arm is extended from the Dragon capsule's crew hatch, retrieves the sample tray and inserts it into the sample canister payload located on the ERV stage.

The EAG re-sponses of C. rosaceana to all tested dosages of pheromonal stimuli and blank controls were lowered by 55 – 58 % and made a linear recovery to 70 – 100 % of the pre-exposure amplitude within 12. 5 min at a rate of 3 – 4 %/min. Exposures of 5 min were insufficient to maximally adapt C. rosaceana; however, expo-sures of 15 and 60 min reduced sensory responsiveness to the same minimum. In contrast, EAG responses of redbanded leafroller, Argyrotaenia velutinana (Walker), after identical pheromone exposure for 5 and 60 min yielded no long-lasting peripheral sensory adaptation as measured by EAGs, even though this species shares the same main pheromone components with C. rosaceana.

A metal catalytic etching method was utilized to prepare monocrystalline silicon nanowire arrays (SiNWs). In a typical process, {{the pieces of the}} selected silicon wafers were washed by sonication in acetone and deionized water. Then, the silicon wafers were dipped into HF/H 2 O solution (1 : 10) to remove the thin oxidation layer and dried by N 2 blow.

40|$|The Electrochemical Hydrogen Compressor EHC was {{evaluated}} against DOE applications for compressing hydrogen at automobile filling stations, in future hydrogen pipelines {{and as a}} commercial replacement for conventional diaphragm hydrogen compressors. It was also evaluated as a modular replacement for the compressors used in petrochemical refineries. If the EHC can be made inexpensive, reliable and long lived then it can satisfy all these applications save pipelines where the requirements for platinum catalyst exceeds the annual world production. The research performed did not completely investigate Molybdenum as a hydrogen anode or cathode, it did show that photoetched 316 stainless steel is inadequate for an EHC. It also showed that: molybdenum bipolar plates, photochemical etching processes, and Gortex <b>Teflon</b> <b>seals</b> are too costly for a commercial EHC. The use of carbon paper in combination with a perforated thin metal electrode demonstrated adequate anode support strength, but is suspect in promoting galvanic corrosion. The nature of the corrosion mechanisms are not well understood, but locally high potentials within the unit cell package are probably involved. The program produced a design with an extraordinary high cell pitch, and a very low part count. This {{is one of the}} promising aspects of the redesigned EHC. The development and successful demonstration of the hydraulic cathode is also important. The problem of corrosion resistant metal bipolar plates is vital to the development of an inexpensive, commercial PEM fuel cell. Our research suggests that there is more to the corrosion process in fuel cells and electrochemical compressors than simple, steady state, galvanic stability. It is an important area for scientific investigation. The experiments and analysis conducted lead to several recommended future research directions. First, we need {{a better understanding of the}} corrosion mechanisms involved. The diagnosis of experimental cells with titration to determine the loss of membrane active sites is recommended. We suspect that the corrosion includes more than simple galvanic mechanisms. The mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are poorly understood. Shunt currents at hydraulic cathode ports were problematic, but are not difficult to cure. In addition to corrosion there is evidence of high component resistivity. This may be due to the deposition of organic compounds, which may be produced electrochemically on the surface of the metal support screens that contact carbon gas diffusion layers (GDLs) or catalyst supports. An investigation of possible electro-organic sythesis mechanisms with emphasis on oxalates formation is warranted. The contaminated cell parts can be placed in an oxidizing atmosphere at high temperature and the weight loss can be observed. This would reveal the existence of organic compounds. Investigation into the effects of conductivity enhancers such as carbon microlayers on supporting carbon paper is also needed. Corrosion solutions should be investigated such as surface passivation of 316 SS parts using nitric acid. Ultra thin silane/siloxane polymer coatings should be tried. These may be especially useful in conjunction with metal felt replacement of carbon paper. A simple cure for the very high, localized corrosion of the anode might be to diffusion bond the metal electrode support screen to bipolar plate. This will insure uniform resistance perpendicular to the plane of the cell and eliminate some of the dependence of the resistance on high stack compression. Alternative materials should be explored. Alternatives to carbon in the cell may be helpful in any context. In particular, alternatives to carbon paper GDLs such as metal felts and alternatives to carbon supports for Pt such as TiC and TiB 2 might also be worthwhile and would be helpful to fuel cells as well. Some alternative to the metals we used in the cell, Mo and 316 SS, are potentially useful. These include Al/Mg/Si alloys. Corrosion resistant materials such as Nb and Mo might prove useful as cladding materials that can be hot stamped. Several cost reduction areas should be explored. Such as the water pumps used in pressure washers. The power consumption of these pumps is a concern, but their cost is surprisingly low. Two components of unit cell construction proved to be extremely costly. The first of these is photoetching, where selective etching of alloys present a corrodible composition in the cell. An alternative to photoetching may be hot stamping. An investigation of materials for hot stamping and the dimension tolerance attainable with this process should be first on the agenda. Hot stamping of clad materials should also be studied. Photoetched electrode supports can be replaced with expanded metal screens (Dexmet). The other high cost area is the use of Gortex TFE seals. Analytic’s prior experience with Acrylic seals shows they can probably replace TFE...|$|R
