5|$|Due to {{attitudes in}} Western {{medicine}} in the 1940s and 1950s, Native American and Fijian cultures and societies were strongly dissuaded from premastication due to concerns about the hygiene of the practice. However, the lack of knowledge regarding premastication and its prohibition by missionaries and doctors instead caused severe anemia in <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> of the population, or resulted in malnourished infants and children deprived of nourishment.|$|E
5|$|Predator {{detection}} by {{the males}} becomes particularly important {{during the period}} when <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> are born.

5|$|Male {{care for}} infants has been {{documented}} in ruffed lemur societies. During early development, adult males may guard the nests of multiple core group females, as well as help care for <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> that were likely fathered by other males. During the season when females practice infant stashing, males effectively lighten the reproductive burden of up to several mothers by guarding, huddling, grooming, travelling, playing with and feeding the young.|$|E

50|$|The Synactive Theory is the {{foundation}} of both: 1) the Assessment of Preterm Infants’ Behavior (APIB), a standardized comprehensive newborn test, and 2) the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP), which is the care and intervention approach, that focuses on each infant’s behavioral cues (e.g., hand(s) to mouth, bracing with feet against a supporting surface) in order to support <b>the</b> <b>infant’s</b> strengths and reduce <b>the</b> <b>infant’s</b> vulnerabilities. <b>The</b> <b>infant’s</b> family is viewed as <b>the</b> <b>infant’s</b> most important nurturer and is integrated in all care from <b>the</b> <b>infant’s</b> birth on throughout <b>the</b> <b>infant’s</b> hospitalization.|$|R
5|$|Unlike other diurnal primates, {{which usually}} carry their infants with them, ruffed lemur mothers will stash their young by concealing {{them in the}} canopy foliage, leaving them to rest and sit quietly for several hours while she forages and {{performs}} other activities. Mothers continue to transport their offspring by mouth, moving them {{one at a time}} by grasping the infant's belly crosswise. This form of transport usually stops around 2.5 months of age when <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> become too heavy to carry.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a captive}} from Barcoor, {{pregnant}} women often gave birth en route, and their babies {{had to be}} borne bundled about them. When they rested, <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> were suspended in cradles from the branches of trees. If anyone happened to die they were buried on the spot. Captives were not given any rations, and {{when the time came}} to move on, those who had not finished cooking had to leave behind their rice and the cooking pots. The Barcoor Manuscript along with other British Government records suggest that 20,000 captives (one-third of the total) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease, and ill treatment by soldiers. The journey to Seringapatam took six weeks. By 1787, some 30,000 captives, half the original number, had perished.|$|E
5|$|In this {{double-blind}} RCT, the preterm infants {{were fed}} either control formula containing phospholipids derived from egg yolk lecithin with sphingomyelin at 13% of total phospholipid or a supplemented formula with milk-derived phospholipids containing 20% sphingomyelin.

25|$|Test: Finally, infants {{are tested}} in the lab using the Headturn-preference procedure, a {{behavioral}} data-collection tool that measures preferences for one kind of auditory stimulus over another. The Headturn-preference procedure maintains that an infant will turn its head towards a stimulus it prefers. This procedure is conducted in a testing booth, with <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> sitting on <b>the</b> lap {{of his or her}} mother. A light is located on either side of <b>the</b> <b>infant.</b> <b>The</b> trial begins when <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> is looking straight ahead. Mother and experimenter are required to wear tight-fitting earphones which deliver masking music {{for the duration of the}} entire procedure. This is done to guarantee that neither mother, nor experimenter bias <b>the</b> <b>infant's</b> response. During each trial, one sidelight flashes, urging <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> to look at it. Once <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> turns his or her head and looks at the light, the sound stimulus is played. The stimulus continues to play until the sound finishes or <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> looks away.

5|$|Reproduction in most strepsirrhine species {{tends to}} be seasonal, {{particularly}} in lemurs. Key factors that affect seasonal reproduction include {{the length of the}} wet season, subsequent food availability, and the maturation time of the species. Like other primates, strepsirrhines are relatively slow breeders compared to other mammals. Their gestation period and interbirth intervals are usually long, and the young develop slowly, just like in haplorhine primates. Unlike simians, some strepsirrhines produce two or three offspring, although some produce only a single offspring. Those that produce multiple offspring tend to build nests for their young. These two traits are thought to be plesiomorphic (ancestral) for primates. The young are precocial (relatively mature and mobile) at birth, but not as coordinated as ungulates (hoofed mammals). Infant care by the mother is relatively prolonged compared to many other mammals, and in some cases, <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> cling to the mother's fur with their hands and feet.|$|E
5|$|Sherwood's four-month sea {{voyage to}} India was difficult; she was again {{pregnant}} and the regiment's ship {{was attacked by}} French warships. The Sherwoods stayed in India for eleven years, moving with the army and an ever-increasing family from Calcutta (Kolkata) to Dinapore (Danapur) to Berhampore (Baharampur) to Cawnpore (Kanpur) to Meerut (Meerut). They had six children in India: Henry (1805–1807), Lucy Martha (1807–1808), Lucy Elizabeth (1809–1835), Emily (1811–1833), Henry Martyn (1813–?), and Sophia (1815–?). The deaths of <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> Henry and Lucy Martha and later of young Emily and Lucy Elizabeth affected Sherwood deeply; she frequently named the heroes and heroines of her books (many of whom die) after her late children.|$|E
5|$|There is {{one case}} study on maltreated twins {{published}} in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006.

The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder. The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.|$|E
40|$|In <b>the</b> {{study of}} <b>infant</b> and young child’s psychopathology, the psychofunctional {{symptoms}} are understood asindicators of temporary or permanent {{problems at the}} level of the interactional exchanges among parents andinfant. In this sense, any event representing a threat to these exchanges between <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> and its parents, such asthe hospitalization of <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> in <b>the</b> neonatal period, deserves attention and investigation. Therefore, assumingthat the initial relations between <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> and its caretakers are structuring, constituting the human psyche andpotentially responsible for the current and future mental health of <b>the</b> <b>infant,</b> this article intends, starting from abrief review on the literature, to approach the specificities of clinical psychology with <b>the</b> <b>infant,</b> <b>the</b> symptom of theinfant, and the problems of the diagnosis in first infancy, reflecting on the possible psychological implications andsymptomatic manifestations in <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> who experienced neonatal hospitalization...|$|R

5|$|After the {{offspring}} are born, lemurs either carry them around or stash them while foraging. When transported, <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> either {{cling to the}} mother's fur or are carried in the mouth by the scruff. In some species, such as bamboo lemurs, infants are carried by mouth until {{they are able to}} cling to their mother's fur. Species that park their offspring include nocturnal species (e.g. mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, and dwarf lemurs), bamboo lemurs, and ruffed lemurs. In the case of the ruffed lemurs, the young are altricial and the mothers build nests for them, much like the smaller, nocturnal lemur species. Woolly lemurs are unusual for nocturnal lemurs because they live in cohesive family groups and carry their single offspring with them rather than parking them. Alloparenting (multiple or group parenting) has been reported in all lemur families except the sportive lemurs and aye-aye. Allonursing is also known to occur in several lemur groups. Even males have been observed caring for infants in species such as the red-bellied lemur, mongoose lemur, eastern lesser bamboo lemur, silky sifaka, fat-tailed dwarf lemur, and ruffed lemurs.|$|E
5|$|Newborns {{have black}} natal coats and bright pink skin. Females {{are the primary}} {{caregivers}} of infants, but males also play a role. In its first few days, the infant {{may be unable to}} stay attached to its mother and relies on her for physical support. However, its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother's fur by itself. By two weeks, the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods, but stays near her. The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older it gets. In general, higher-ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank, which usually keep their offspring close to them. However, this difference only lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant's life. Olive baboons do not seem to practice co-operative parenting, but a female may groom an infant that is not hers. Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another's young, as they have not yet produced offspring of their own. One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants is that they can prepare for their future roles as mothers. Infant baboons born to first-time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers, which suggests that prior experience in caring for infants is important. Adult males in the groups also care for <b>the</b> <b>infants,</b> as {{they are likely to be}} related to them. Males groom infants, reducing the amount of parasites they may have, and calm them when they are stressed. They may also protect them from predators, such as chimpanzees. However, adult males exploit infants and use them to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them.|$|E
5|$|Other, {{more recent}} {{studies suggest that}} the idea of object {{permanence}} may not be an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E

50|$|Granny {{midwives}} had specific protocols for newborn infants. When {{children were}} born, granny midwives might place charms on <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> such as silver or copper coins to help bind <b>the</b> <b>infant’s</b> spirit to its body. Granny midwives also encouraged breastfeeding after birth, as breast milk would pass the mother’s wisdom or “mother wit” to her infant.

Another common practice among granny midwives was <b>the</b> coating of <b>infant’s</b> skin in lard, tallow, or Vaseline.
