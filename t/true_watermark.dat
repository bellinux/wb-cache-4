50|$|In 1885 a new {{definitive}} series used {{larger and}} more readable numeric tablets, and surmounted Carol's profile with a bird. In 1889 the stamp paper was also impressed with a coat of arms, similar to, but not a <b>true</b> <b>watermark.</b> In 1891, Romania issued its first commemorative stamps, a series of five in which the usual profile of the king was framed by an inscription marking 25 years of his reign. The series of 1893 introduced a variety of frames, and the first stamps denominated in lei.|$|E
50|$|In 1957, {{governor}} of Bank Indonesia Sjafruddin Prawiranegara commissioned {{a new series}} of notes from English printer, Thomas De La Rue & Co. However, Syafruddin's involvement with PRRI meant that he was replaced in January 1958 as governor by Loekman Hakim. Specimens were produced in denominations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000 rupiah, and the first of these to be brought into circulation were the 100 and 1000 rupiah notes, in 1958, due to the counterfeiting of these denominations of the 1952 series (the counterfeit notes can be distinguished by the wavy line watermark being printed onto the paper rather than a <b>true</b> <b>watermark).</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{new design}} with more legible seated Helvetia {{appeared}} in 1862, now sporting a [...] "watermark" [...] {{consisting of a}} cross inside an ellipse (not a <b>true</b> <b>watermark</b> because it was impressed into the paper after printing), {{and for the first}} time, perforations. The units of currency disappeared, with [...] "HELVETIA" [...] inscribed at the top and [...] "FRANCO" [...] at the bottom. Initially printed on white wove paper, the stamps switched to granite paper in 1881. (The paper has red and blue silk threads, clearly visible in the larger image of the stamp to the left.) The stamps continued in use until 1883; many of them are common and cheaply available today, although legitimate cancellations on the granite paper varieties are uncommon because of the short period of use.|$|E
