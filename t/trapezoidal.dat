5|$|The Su-25 has a {{conventional}} aerodynamic layout with a shoulder-mounted <b>trapezoidal</b> wing and a traditional tailplane and rudder. Several metals {{are used in}} the construction of the airframe: 60% aluminium, 19% steel, 13.5% titanium, 2% magnesium alloy and 5.5% other materials.|$|E
5|$|A {{settlement}} and cemetery of the Lengyel-Polgár cultural zone, dated around or after 4600 BCE, {{was discovered in}} Ślęza, Wrocław County. It consisted of a central long <b>trapezoidal</b> house accompanied by several post-built supporting structures. Among the large explored settlements of the Lengyel culture from the 4400-4000 BCE period, there is one in Brześć Kujawski, and another one in Osłonki, solidly fortified about 4200 BCE after an assault incident involving arson and murder, both located in the Kujawy region. At the Osłonki settlement nearly 30 <b>trapezoidal</b> houses and over 80 graves were located, some of them with many copper ornaments. The agricultural and construction activities of the communities centered on the two large settlements (hunting and fishing were also practiced) caused very likely an accumulation of environmental damage, which eventually forced them to abandon the area. 4th millennium BC constructions reinforced with ditches and palisades and ceramics molded into figural representations of the Lengyel-Polgár culture were located in Podłęże, Wieliczka County.|$|E
5|$|Crickets {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with mostly cylindrical, somewhat vertically flattened bodies. The head is spherical with long slender antennae arising from cone-shaped scapes (first segments) and just behind {{these are two}} large compound eyes. On the forehead are three ocelli (simple eyes). The pronotum (first thoracic segment) is <b>trapezoidal</b> in shape, robust, and well-sclerotinized. It is smooth and has neither dorsal or lateral keels (ridges).|$|E
5|$|Littleton {{incorporated}} {{optical lens}} blanks manufactured by Corning {{with his own}} hot-worked glass. In each case he sandblasted and cut the optical disc, draping, and in one case piercing, the disc with fluid, cased glass forms. These were followed, in 1978, by Littleton’s Solid Geometry series, in which heavy cased glass forms were cut into <b>trapezoidal,</b> spheroid and ovoid shapes and highly polished.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} that the {{original}} proposals were being studied, advances in supersonic flight were proceeding rapidly. The narrow delta was establishing itself as a preferred planform for supersonic flight, replacing earlier designs like the swept-wing and <b>trapezoidal</b> layouts seen on designs like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and the earlier WS-110 concepts. Engines {{able to cope with}} higher temperatures and widely varying intake ramp air speeds were also under design, allowing for sustained supersonic speeds.|$|E
5|$|Like the House of the Lake, most {{houses in}} the crowded Theatre Quarter of Delos have irregular-shaped floor plans (such as <b>trapezoidal</b> designs), as opposed to square or {{rectangular}} designs. The narrow and irregular street grid is unlike that of other quarters, where streets usually meet at approximately right angles. Similar {{to the majority of}} excavated homes of Delos, those in the Theatre Quarter feature an open courtyard without porticoes, instead of the peristyle layout with columns. Some of the {{houses in the}} Theatre Quarter lack interior decoration altogether, with neither wall murals nor mosaics, which is unusual for most Delian homes.|$|E
5|$|The BT46 was an {{aluminium}} alloy monocoque featuring the <b>trapezoidal</b> cross section common {{to many of}} Gordon Murray’s 1970s designs. It featured inbuilt pneumatic jacks fed from an external supply of compressed air to lift it off the ground for tyre changes during practice. It employed a very early version of the carbon brakes that were in universal use by the mid-1980s—a concept taken from the aircraft industry. The system, which Brabham had been developing since 1976, combined carbon composite brake pads with a steel disc faced with carbon composite 'pucks'.|$|E
5|$|The flaps {{are mounted}} by steel sliders and rollers, {{attached}} to brackets {{on the rear}} spar. The <b>trapezoidal</b> ailerons are near the wingtips. The fuselage of the Su-25 has an ellipsoidal section and is of semi-monocoque, stressed-skin construction, arranged as a longitudinal load-bearing framework of longerons, beams and stringers, with a transverse load-bearing assembly of frames. The one-piece horizontal tailplane {{is attached to the}} load-bearing frame at two mounting points.|$|E
5|$|The {{space between}} the large {{fortification}}s was covered {{by a series of}} smaller redans (chevron-shaped forts) and barkans (<b>trapezoidal</b> forts). The strongest fortification in the outer line of defences was Fort 56 in the suburb of Wola, built around the St Lawrence's Church. It was supported by Lunette 57 in front of it, and two forts (54 and 55) to the south of it. The headquarters was in Fort 73 between Rakowiec and the Jerozolimskie Gate.|$|E
5|$|Though {{a myriad}} of bones was {{available}} by 1969, many important ones were missing or hard to interpret. There were few postorbital skull elements, no femurs, no sacrum, no furcula or sternum, missing vertebrae, and (Ostrom thought) only a tiny fragment of a coracoid. Ostrom's skeletal reconstruction of Deinonychus included a very unusual pelvic bone– a pubis that was <b>trapezoidal</b> and flat, unlike that of other theropods, but which was the same length as the ischium and which was found right next to it.|$|E
5|$|Towers A, B, and C house mostly first-year freshmen. The towers {{are all of}} {{different}} heights, and differ slightly in their living accommodations. Tower B is the tallest of the three, at 22 stories. Tower A is 19 stories tall, and Tower C is 16 stories in height. Rooms in Towers A and B are the same size, roughly 17ft (5.2m) by 11ft (3.4m). These measurements are not exact, however, because the three towers are cylindrical in shape (although actually twenty-sided) and the rooms themselves are therefore somewhat <b>trapezoidal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arran has a {{particular}} concentration of early Neolithic Clyde Cairns, a form of Gallery grave. The typical style of these structures is a rectangular or <b>trapezoidal</b> stone and earth mound that encloses a chamber lined with larger stone slabs. Pottery and bone fragments found inside the chambers suggest they were used for interment and some have forecourts, {{which may have been}} an area for public display or ritual. There are two good examples in Monamore Glen west of the village of Lamlash, and similar structures called the Giants' Graves above Whiting Bay. There are numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times, including six stone circles on Machrie Moor (Gaelic: Am Machaire).|$|E
5|$|In mid-1956, initial {{designs were}} {{presented}} by the two companies. Zip fuel was {{to be used in}} the afterburners to improve range by 10 to 15 percent over conventional fuel. Both designs featured huge wing tip fuel tanks that could be jettisoned when their fuel was depleted before a supersonic dash to the target. The tanks also included the outer portions of the wing, which would also be jettisoned to produce a smaller wing suitable for supersonic speeds. Both became <b>trapezoidal</b> wings after ejection, at that time the highest performance planform known. They also featured flush cockpits to maintain the highest fineness ratio possible in spite of its effects on visibility.|$|E
5|$|Termites are {{relatively}} poor fliers and are readily blown downwind in wind speeds {{of less than}} 2km/h, shedding their wings soon after landing at an acceptable site, where they mate and attempt to form a nest in damp timber or earth. Wings of most termites have three heavy veins along the basal part of {{the front edge of}} the forewing and the crossveins near the wing tip are angled, making <b>trapezoidal</b> cells. Although subterranean termite wings have just two major veins along the front edge of the forewing and the cross veins towards the wingtip are perpendicular to these veins, making square and rectangular cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtyard}} façade of {{the main}} wing, in the same classical style as its counterpart facing the Ill, is narrower. A strong emphasis is put on the verticality of the windows, by which means the impression of height is accentuated. Again, a central avant-corps is crowned with a triangular pediment bearing reliefs {{and in this case}} also statues. Both façades are richly decorated with allegorical mascarons (depicting seasons, temperaments, continents and elements), eighteen in all on the riverside façade and nine in all on the courtyard façade, to which the riverside façade adds a pair of broad wrought-iron balconies. Due to the difference in width and the <b>trapezoidal</b> plan, the centres of the façades are not aligned.|$|E
5|$|The palace is {{structured}} {{around a large}} and paved courtyard. It has a <b>trapezoidal</b> plan, and the land falls away toward the river Ill. To compensate for the slope, the riverside (southern) façade of the main wing has four floors (including the Mansard roof), while the courtyard (northern) façade has three floors. The half-buried floor corresponds to the basement and now houses the archaeological museum (see below, Museums). The riverside façade is thus both the highest and the widest of the palace. The terrace before it, facing the quai des Bateliers, is closed at both ends by elaborate wrought-iron gates adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan.|$|E
5|$|Viewed {{from the}} top, the parietal {{increases}} in width at the back; {{the increase is}} small in K. langenbergensis, such that the bone is overall rectangular, but the difference is larger in K. guimarotae. The back of the bone bears a small notch in K. langenbergensis and a general concavity in K. guimarotae that slightly exposes the underlying supraoccipital. The postorbital bears two branches that join with a gentle curve, separated by an angle of 130° in K. langenbergensis. The supratemporal fenestra is roughly square in K. guimarotae but has a thinner back end in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the maximum distance between the supratemporal fenestrae is {{about a third of}} the total width of the top of the skull. The <b>trapezoidal</b> infratemporal fenestra is 1.5 times as long as it is wide in K. langenbergensis.|$|E
5|$|The XF-104 had {{a radical}} wing design. Most {{supersonic}} jets use a swept or delta wing. This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance, lift, and internal space for fuel and equipment. However {{the most efficient}} shape for high-speed, supersonic flight had {{been found to be}} a small, straight, mid-mounted, <b>trapezoidal</b> wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading. The wing was extremely thin, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.4%. The leading edges of the wing were so thin (0.016in/0.41mm) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews, and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations. The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage. The hydraulic actuators driving the ailerons were only one inch (25mm) thick to fit into the available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument. The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed. The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the thornback guitarfish is heart-shaped, slightly {{longer than it}} is wide, and thick towards the front. The snout is short and broad, with a blunt tip protruding slightly from the disc. The eyes are small and widely spaced; the spiracles are larger than the eyes and lie closely behind. The wide nostrils are preceded by moderately large, broad flaps of skin. The mouth is wide and gently arched; there are a pair of creases running from the mouth corners to the nostrils, enclosing a roughly <b>trapezoidal</b> area. The lower lip is inscribed by a deep furrow that wraps around the mouth corners. The small teeth have low crowns that may be sharp to blunt, and are arranged in 68–82 rows in the upper jaw and 64–78 rows in the lower jaw. The five pairs of gill slits are small and located beneath the disc.|$|E
5|$|Mesolithic humans {{arrived in}} the Firth of the Clyde during the fourth {{millennium}} BC, probably from Ireland. This {{was followed by a}} wave of Neolithic peoples using the same route and {{there is some evidence that}} the Firth of Clyde was a significant route via which mainland Scotland was colonised at this time. A particular style of megalithic structure developed in Argyll, the Clyde estuary and elsewhere in western Scotland that has become known as the Clyde cairn. They are rectangular or <b>trapezoidal</b> in shape with a small enclosing chamber faced with large slabs of stone set on end and sometimes subdivided into smaller compartments. A forecourt area may have been used for displays or rituals associated with the interment of the dead, who were placed inside the chambers. They are concentrated in Arran, Bute and Kintyre and it is likely that the Clyde cairns were the earliest forms of Neolithic monument constructed by incoming settlers although few of the 100 or so examples have been given a radiocarbon dating. An example at Monamore on Arran has been dated to 3160 BC, although it was almost certainly built earlier than that, possibly c. 4000BC. There are also numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times, including six stone circles on Machrie Moor, Arran and other examples on Great Cumbrae and Bute.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{induction}} and {{synchronous motor}} drives are typically with either six-step or sinusoidal waveform output, BLDC motor drives are usually with <b>trapezoidal</b> current waveform; {{the behavior of}} both sinusoidal and <b>trapezoidal</b> PM machines is however identical {{in terms of their}} fundamental aspects.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{advantage of}} square threads {{is that they}} have a much higher intrinsic efficiency than <b>trapezoidal</b> threads (Acme or metric <b>trapezoidal).</b> Due to the lack of a thread angle there is no radial pressure, or bursting pressure, on the nut. This also increases the nut life.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Babylonians {{used the}} <b>trapezoidal</b> rule to {{integrate}} the motion of Jupiter along the ecliptic.|$|E
25|$|In {{case of the}} <b>trapezoidal</b> thread {{form the}} angle is 30° instead of 29°. All {{dimensions}} are in millimeters.|$|E
25|$|The <b>trapezoidal</b> {{metric thread}} form {{is similar to}} the Acme thread form, except the thread angle is 30°. It is codified by DIN 103. While metric screw threads are more {{prevalent}} worldwide than imperial threads for triangular thread forms, the imperially sized Acme threads predominate in the <b>trapezoidal</b> thread form. In some cases customers prefer Acme threads for power screws regardless of metric standards used elsewhere in the product.|$|E
25|$|In this way, it is {{possible}} to calculate the AUC by using an average of a number of <b>trapezoidal</b> approximations.|$|E
25|$|The BLDC motor's {{characteristic}} <b>trapezoidal</b> back-emf waveform {{is derived}} partly from the stator windings being evenly distributed, and partly from {{the placement of}} the rotor's PMs. Also known as electronically commutated DC or inside out DC motors, the stator windings of <b>trapezoidal</b> BLDC motors can be with single-phase, two-phase or three-phase and use Hall effect sensors mounted on their windings for rotor position sensing and low cost closed-loop control of the electronic commutator.|$|E
25|$|The {{tower was}} built by Carillion using {{post-tensioned}} flat slab concrete construction techniques {{and was the first}} structure in the United Kingdom to use the Doka SKE 100 automatic climbing system and <b>trapezoidal</b> windshield.|$|E
25|$|Across its {{geographic}} range, {{this species}} varies greatly phenotypically. As a result, great confusion {{between it and}} other related species, most notably Bothrops atrox, which is similar in color but usually has yellow or rust-like tones and rectangular or <b>trapezoidal</b> blotches.|$|E
25|$|When she died, she and Christo {{were at work}} on Over the River, a set {{of fabric}} panels over the Arkansas River in Colorado (begun in 1992) and The Mastaba, a stack of 410,000 oil barrels {{configured}} as a mastaba, a <b>trapezoidal</b> prism, in the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
25|$|The castle {{structure}} {{includes a}} few lines of walls, the rectangular keep tower addorsed in the southeast by a line of walls, the former-castle residence and corner wall, accessed from an arch, and another line of walls that connects the residence to a small <b>trapezoidal</b> tower.|$|E
25|$|The site {{featured}} a large <b>trapezoidal</b> wall and a temple to the goddess Nisaba and the god Khani. Among the tablets from Tell Harmal {{are two of}} the epic of Gilgamesh and two with parts of the Laws of Eshnunna as well as some important mathematical tablets.|$|E
25|$|The <b>trapezoidal</b> rule, {{in which}} the method of Riemann sums for {{numerical}} integration was republished in a Diabetes research journal, Diabetes Care. The method is almost always taught in high school calculus, and was thus considered {{an example of an}} extremely well known idea being re-branded as a new discovery.|$|E
25|$|The new fighter {{may have}} a {{significantly}} longer fuselage than other fifth generation fighter designs, such as the F-22, for reduction of transonic and supersonic drag. A <b>trapezoidal</b> wing may be implemented for reduction of drag and radar signature. Use of an 's'-shaped air inlet and boundary layer separation system would greatly reduce radar signature.|$|E
25|$|Apophysomyces variabilis {{resembles the}} other {{three members of the}} genus Apophysomyces but is {{characterized}} by the variable appearance of its sporangiospores and sporangiophores which range from club-shaped to <b>trapezoidal</b> to flattened spheres. The sporangiophore can measure up to 400μm in length and has a funnel-shaped apophysis or swelling below the columella. Hyphae are smooth-walled, aseptate, and branched.|$|E
25|$|The Kolibri's tail was conventional, with a <b>trapezoidal</b> plan {{tailplane}} and elevators {{mounted on}} top of the fuselage and with a quadrantal fin and a rounded rudder that reached down to the keel. It had a very simple, fixed, tailskid undercarriage with the mainwheels on a short single axle held just below the fuselage underside, making the track narrow.|$|E
