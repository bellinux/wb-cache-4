Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E
2500|$|Sufis {{believe the}} sharia (exoteric [...] "canon"), tariqa (esoteric [...] "order") and haqiqa ("truth") are {{mutually}} interdependent. Sufism leads the adept, called salik or [...] "wayfarer", in his sulûk or [...] "road" [...] through different stations (maqaam) until he reaches his goal, the perfect tawhid, the existential confession that God is One. Ibn Arabi says, [...] "When we see someone in this Community {{who claims to}} be able to guide others to God, but is remiss in but one rule of the Sacred Law—even if he manifests miracles that stagger the mind—asserting that his shortcoming is a special dispensation for him, we do not even <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, for such a person is not a sheikh, nor is he speaking the truth, for no one is entrusted with the secrets of God Most High save one in whom the ordinances of the Sacred Law are preserved. (Jamiʿ karamat al-awliyaʾ)".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, during the Regency {{of the future}} King George IV, the blue suit was revolutionised by a courtier named George Beau Brummel. Brummel created a suit that closely fitted the human form. [...] The new style had a long tail coat cut to fit the body and long tight {{trousers}} to replace the knee-length breeches and stockings of the previous century. He used plain colours, such as blue and grey, to concentrate attention on {{the form of the}} body, not the clothes. Brummel observed, [...] "If people <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you in the street, you are not well dressed." [...] This fashion was adopted by the Prince Regent, then by London society and the upper classes. [...] Originally the coat and trousers were different colours, but in the 19th century the suit of a single colour became fashionable. By the late 19th century the black suit had become the uniform of businessmen in England and America. In the 20th century, the black suit was largely replaced by the dark blue or grey suit.|$|E
60|$|The Major gave an {{involuntary}} start, and then <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him curiously.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Andre {{across the}} wide space that now {{separated}} them.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Joe again. He {{was staring}} as blankly as ever.|$|R
60|$|A picador {{passes on}} horseback in his uncouth clothes, and all <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed almost}} as if Jeanne was {{conscious}} of the fixity of Marguerite's gaze, for though she did not <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her, the flush gradually deepened in her cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|Their {{two figures}} {{attracted}} some {{attention in the}} crowded street, for Hilary-tall and slight, with his thin, bearded face and soft felt hat--was {{what is known as}} [...] "a distinguished-looking man"; and the little model, though not [...] "distinguished-looking" [...] in her old brown skirt and tam-o'shanter cap, had the sort of face which made men and even women <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her. To men she {{was a little bit of}} strangely interesting, not too usual, flesh and blood; to women, she was that which made men <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her. Yet now and again there would rise in some passer-by a feeling more impersonal, as though the God of Pity had shaken wings overhead, and dropped a tiny feather.|$|E
60|$|Trot <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, and {{her sweet}} face was grave and curious.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the newcomer, {{and saw the}} Lizard {{directly}} behind him.|$|R
60|$|This time he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her. The old dagger {{was drawn}} in her.|$|R
6000|$|Now although, as I suppose, she {{had neither}} seen nor heard me, for I {{came up from}} behind her, Sihamba did not start or cry out as any other woman would have done; {{she did not even}} <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me as she {{answered}} in a clear and steady voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go after her!" [...] {{he burst}} out, {{with a sharp}} edge in his voice. [...] "Do you think she would <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me, or value any word I ever uttered to her again at more than a dirty feather?--Explain! How can a man explain {{at the expense of}} a woman?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> 'im," [...] he said bluntly. [...] "I could 'ear 'is voice plain enough--so {{why should}} I {{take a look}} at 'im? 'Ow did I know there was a goin' to be murder done in my cab, and me wanted to say what the murderer looked like?" ...|$|E
60|$|In sheer amazement M. Binet {{checked in}} his stride, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his companion.|$|R
60|$|Alora <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her father. He was filing {{his pipe}} and scowling more darkly than ever.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} the prince <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his sister. She was gazing earnestly into his face.|$|R
60|$|In {{an instant}} I saw that by attacking the Okarians {{from the rear}} I could so quickly disorganize them that their further {{resistance}} would be short-lived, and with this idea in mind I sprang from the dais, casting a word of explanation to Dejah Thoris over my shoulder, though I did not <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|E
60|$|She {{exhibited}} no {{anger at}} what he said, nor did she <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, but only replied, in a low voice, {{that he should not}} talk so, for that it could only be a pain to them both to speak of such things, and that whether she would or no, she must do everything her grandfather bade her, he being indeed a terrible man.|$|E
60|$|In {{some way}} {{she found herself}} {{a few moments later}} walking out through the iron gate into the throng of promenaders back of the seats. It was the most splendid moment of her life. She forgot her fear of Mason in the {{excitement}} of the moment. She walked with hands clenched tightly and head lifted. The look on her face, and the burning color in her face made scores of people <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|E
60|$|She neither <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him nor spoke. No ghost or {{stranger}} {{could have}} passed more silently.|$|R
60|$|He {{gripped his}} knees and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me again. For half a minute, perhaps, he stared silently.|$|R
60|$|Receiver <b>to</b> ear, he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Paula. Graham, {{bending over}} her but not {{touching}} her, met his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|RAINA (suddenly coming {{round the}} corner of the house and {{standing}} at the top of the steps in the path). Raina is here. (She makes a charming picture as they all <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her. She wears an underdress of pale green silk, draped with an overdress of thin ecru canvas embroidered with gold. On her head she wears a pretty Phrygian cap of gold tinsel. Sergius, with an exclamation of pleasure, goes impulsively to meet her. She stretches out her hand: he drops chivalrously on one knee and kisses it.) ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was late}} that night and after an eternity of resolutions and doubts and indecisions that Mrs. Britling went to her husband. He was sitting close up to the fire with his chin upon his hands, waiting for her; he felt that she would come to him, and he was {{thinking}} meanwhile of Hugh with a slow unprogressive movement of the mind. He showed by a movement that he heard her enter the room, {{but he did not}} <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her. He shrank a little from her approach.|$|E
60|$|The great matador, Mazzantini or Guerrita, arrives the {{day before}} the fight, and perhaps takes a walk in the Sierpes. People <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him and acquaintances shake his hand, pleased that all the world may know how {{friendly}} they are with so great a man. The hero himself is calm and gracious. He feels himself a person of merit, and cannot be unconscious that he has a fortune of several million pesetas bringing in a reasonable interest. He talks with ease and assurance, often condescends to joke, and elegantly waves his hand, sparkling with diamonds of great value.|$|E
60|$|Sam {{walked slowly}} to the bow. As he did this, Wingate <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him in a {{speculative}} way.|$|R
60|$|James {{shrugged his}} shoulders, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Mary, who was coming towards him with letters in her hand.|$|R
60|$|James <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his uncle, noting {{a little}} contemptuously {{the change of}} his costume, and its extravagant juvenility.|$|R
60|$|They {{went down}} the slope and entered the grove. It was an open, pretty spot, with grass and wild flowers, and old, {{bleached}} logs, half sunny and half shady under the new-born, fluttering aspen leaves. Wade saw Moore sitting on his horse. And it struck the hunter significantly that the cowboy should be mounted when an hour back he had left him sitting disconsolately on a log. Moore wanted Columbine to see him first, after all these months of fear and dread, mounted upon his horse. Wade heard Columbine's glad little cry, {{but he did not}} <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her then. But when they reached the spot where Moore stood Wade could not resist the desire to see the meeting between the lovers.|$|E
6000|$|... "A small man," [...] she said; [...] "Saduko {{would make}} two of him, and the other"--who was he, I wondered--"three. His hair, too, is ugly; he cuts it short and it sticks {{up like that}} on a cat's back. Iya!" [...] (i.e. Piff!), and she moved her hand contemptuously, [...] "a feather of a man. But white--white, {{one of those who}} rule. Why, they all of them know that he is their master. They call him 'He-who-never-Sleeps.' They say that he has the courage of a lioness with young--he who got away when Dingaan killed Piti [Retief] and the Boers; they say that he is quick and cunning as a snake, and that Panda and his great indunas think more of him than of any white man they know. He is {{unmarried}} also, though they say, too, that twice he had a wife, who died, and now he does not <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> women, which is strange in any man, and shows that he will escape trouble and succeed. Still, it must be remembered that they are all ugly down here in Zululand, cows, or heifers who will be cows. Piff! no more." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Lush's {{absence from}} Diplow during Gwendolen's visit had been due, not to any fear {{on his part}} of meeting that supercilious young lady, or of being abashed by her frank dislike, but to an {{engagement}} from which he expected important consequences. He was gone, in fact, to the Wanchester station to meet a lady, accompanied by a maid and two children, whom he put into a fly, and afterward followed to the hotel of the Golden Keys, in that town. An impressive woman, whom many would <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> again in passing; her figure was slim and sufficiently tall, her face rather emaciated, so that its sculpturesque beauty was the more pronounced, her crisp hair perfectly black, and her large, anxious eyes what we call black. Her dress was soberly correct, her age, perhaps, physically more advanced {{than the number of}} years would imply, but hardly less than seven-and-thirty. An uneasy-looking woman: her glance seemed to presuppose that the people and things were going to be unfavorable to her, while she was, nevertheless, ready to meet them with resolution. The children were lovely--a dark-haired girl of six or more, a fairer boy of five. When Lush incautiously expressed some surprise at her having brought the children, she said, with a sharp-toned intonation-- ...|$|E
60|$|They <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the bird, which fluttered {{its wings}} and {{stared back at}} them with its big eyes.|$|R
60|$|But when Boabdil was {{crossing}} the mountains he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the city he had lost, {{and burst into}} tears.|$|R
