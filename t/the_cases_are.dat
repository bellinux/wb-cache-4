5|$|The {{first season}} of the American {{television}} series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., {{which is based on}} the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolves around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, who are assigned to several dangerous cases. <b>The</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> centered on Project Centipede and its leader, The Clairvoyant, while Coulson also searches for answers concerning his mysterious resurrection after dying in The Avengers. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise, and was produced by ABC Studios, Marvel Television, and Mutant Enemy Productions. Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell served as showrunners.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} start of class, {{kindergarten}} teacher Rebecca Adler (Robin Tunney) becomes dysphasic, falls to the floor, and experiences seizures. Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) attempts to convince the curmudgeonly Gregory House to treat Adler, but House initially dismisses him, believing that the case would be boring. Hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) approaches House in the elevator and attempts to persuade him to fulfill his duties at the hospital's walk-in clinic, a task House loathes because <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> usually simplistic. House refuses, claiming that Cuddy cannot fire him due to tenure, and hurriedly leaves. When House's team attempts to perform an MRI on Adler, they discover that House's authorization for diagnostics has been revoked; Cuddy restores his authorization in exchange for his working at the clinic.|$|E
5|$|The genetic {{heritability}} of Alzheimer's disease (and memory components thereof), {{based on}} reviews of twin and family studies, ranges from 49% to 79%. Around 0.1% of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> familial forms of autosomal (not sex-linked) dominant inheritance, which have an onset before age 65. This {{form of the}} disease is known as early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Most of autosomal dominant familial AD {{can be attributed to}} mutations in one of three genes: those encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2. Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called Aβ42, which is the main component of senile plaques. Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major forms—particularly Aβ40—without increasing Aβ42 levels.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{if there}} is a mistrial, or <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> {{overturned}} on appeal, generally this is without prejudice and (in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of decision overturned on appeal) either all of <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> retried, or, if not all of <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> overturned, <b>the</b> parts that were overturned (like a sentencing hearing) <b>are</b> retried. If <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> dismissed because of prosecutorial misconduct, it will typically be dismissed with prejudice, which means that the defendant cannot be retried.|$|R
25|$|In 2010, {{the motion}} to re-open <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> denied by <b>the</b> authorities, stating that <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> not {{sufficient}} for re-opening.|$|R
25|$|Michael DuVally, a {{spokesman}} for Goldman Sachs, said <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> without merit. Robert Lenzner, a columnist at Forbes, wrote that Goldman Sachs controls only 3% of the global market and is therefore too small to have pricing power. An article published by Bloomberg L.P. also debunked the conspiracy theory.|$|E
25|$|Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and his Chief of Staff John Harris {{were arrested}} {{at their homes}} at 6:15a.m. on December 9, 2008 by deputies of the United States Marshals Service {{on behalf of the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Blagojevich and Harris were each charged with one count of {{conspiracy}} to commit mail and wire fraud and one count of soliciting bribes. The case involved sweeping pay to play and influence peddling allegations, including the alleged solicitation of personal benefit in exchange for an appointment to the United States Senate as a replacement for Barack Obama, who had resigned after being elected President of the United States. United States Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald noted that there had been no evidence of wrongdoing by Obama. <b>The</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> part of a broader federal investigation by Fitzgerald code-named Operation Board Games that {{had been going on for}} three years in which 15 people have been charged by Fitzgerald.|$|E
25|$|The CNDH {{suggested}} after Bermúdez Zacarías' {{murder to}} create a policy to have judges handle cases anonymously {{in order to protect}} their identity. They argued that by having this policy in place, judges would be able to preside over cases impartially and without being intimidated. This method was used in Peru, Colombia, and Italy to protect judges who faced threats from armed groups. The Mexican government stated that they would debate and consider the proposal as an option, but said that accepting the policy would mean that they were giving in to the pressures from organized crime. Moreover, the 2016 judicial reform – the New Criminal Justice System (Spanish: Nuevo Sistema de Justicia Penal, NSJP) – advocated for greater judicial transparency, a move that was seen at odds with the proposed policy. When Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered, only 70 out of 1,391 federal judges had security measures in place to protect them from attacks. Several judges advocated for more security measures, but this also posed several challenges because of the limited resources and long processes that would need to take place for such budgets to be approved by politicians. Local judges, however, do not enjoy the level of protection that their federal counterparts have, and attacks from organized crime members are more prevalent. In addition, most of the cases involving attacks or intimidation against judges are not reported to the police. If <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> filed to the police, many of them do not reach a court of law and are closed without imparting justice.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> Anderson v. Cryovac. The first {{reported}} decision in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> at 96 F.R.D. 431 (denial of defendants' motion to dismiss).|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> {{assigned}} to Judge Ronald S.W. Lew on September 21, 2005. The following year, Lew took senior status and <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> eventually re{{assigned to}} Judge Stephen G. Larson on October 30, 2006. In November 2009, Larson recused himself and <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> reassigned to Judge Otis D. Wright II.|$|R
50|$|On May Day 1995 <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> {{challenged}} by defence barristers, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> {{an abuse of}} process and that charges should be stayed as {{the passage of time}} had made a fair trial impossible. The presiding magistrate agreed and as <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> never presented before a jury, the law regards the accused as presumed innocent.|$|R
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Passenger" [...] {{begins with the}} band members packing {{themselves}} and their musical instruments into suitcases. [...] They are transported to an airport while the song's first verse is played. [...] During the first chorus, <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> loaded onto a baggage carousel with a bomb, whilst security personnel are distracted. [...] The suitcases and bomb are then loaded onto an aeroplane. [...] During the second verse, the bomb explodes, and the suitcases containing the band members fall {{out of it and}} are swallowed by an unnamed creature resembling a whale. [...] They are later ejected from the blowhole of the creature into zero-gravity, when the second chorus commences. [...] At the end of the chorus, the suitcases re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere. The video ends with the suitcases floating in the ocean.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are seven}} Latin noun cases, which {{also apply to}} {{adjectives}} and pronouns and mark a noun's syntactic role in the sentence by means of inflections.

2500|$|Criminal {{profiler}} Pat Brown {{calls the}} serial killer theory [...] "ludicrous", {{arguing that the}} evidence does not fit {{what is known about}} serial killers. Brown also believes that the smiley face images found in some of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> likely nothing more than coincidences based upon making a guess at where the body entered the water and searching a wide area until an example of smiley face graffiti can be found.

2500|$|The Report {{detailed}} 59 case studies, {{though for}} legal reasons their locations were changed. New York Times science editor Walter Sullivan, {{in his introduction}} to the published version of the Report, said the series [...] "reads like a modern, real-life collection of Sherlock Holmes episodes. The cases range from the eerily perplexing to the preposterously naive. The reader is given a taste of scientific method, even though <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> often such that they defy anything approaching deductive analysis." [...] Six chapters covered field studies of such physical evidence as electromagnetic affects, and visual and radar images. One treated the observations of U.S. astronauts.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{police forces}} that have {{investigated}} the deaths dispute the conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> linked. The La Crosse, Wisconsin, police department, which {{was in charge of}} eight of the investigations, released an official statement reiterating their original conclusions that the deaths were accidental drownings of inebriated men and stating that no smiley face symbols were found in connection with any of these cases. [...] The Center for Homicide Research in Minneapolis, Minnesota, published a research brief that also attempted to scientifically refute the theory. In March 2009, Lee Gilbertson, a criminal justice faculty member at St. Cloud State University, voiced his support for the theory on an episode of Larry King Live in which the alleged murders were discussed.|$|E
2500|$|The Court is {{authorized}} to sit either en banc or in divisions of 3, 5 or 7 members. Since the 1970s, the Court has constituted itself in 3 divisions with 5 members each. A majority of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> heard and {{decided by the}} divisions, rather than the court en banc. However, the Constitution requires that the Court hear en banc “ll cases involving the constitutionality of a treaty, international or executive agreement, as well as “those involving the constitutionality, application, or operation of presidential decrees, proclamations, orders, instructions, ordinances, and other regulations”. [...] The Court en banc also decides cases originally heard by a division when a majority vote cannot be reached within the division. The Court also has the discretion {{to hear a case}} en banc even if no constitutional issue is involved, as it typically does if the decision would reverse precedent or presents novel or important questions.|$|E

2500|$|Although Stevenson {{mainly focused}} on cases of {{children}} who seemed to remember past lives, he also studied two cases in which adults under hypnosis seemed to remember a past life and show rudimentary use of a language they had not learned in the present life. Stevenson called this phenomenon “xenoglossy.” The linguist Sarah Thomason, critiquing these cases, wrote that Stevenson is “unsophisticated about language" [...] and that <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> unconvincing. Thomason concluded, [...] "the linguistic evidence is too weak to provide support for the claims of xenoglossy." [...] William J. Samarin, a linguist from the University of Toronto, wrote that Stevenson corresponded with linguists in a selective and unprofessional manner. He said that Stevenson corresponded with one linguist {{in a period of}} six years [...] "without raising any discussion about the kinds of thing that linguists would need to know." [...] Another linguist, William Frawley, wrote, [...] "Stevenson does not consider enough linguistic evidence in these cases to warrant his metaphysics." ...|$|E
2500|$|An Islamic Front {{sharia court}} judge in Aleppo, Mohamed Najeeb Bannan, stated: [...] "The legal {{reference}} is the Islamic Sharia. <b>The</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> different, from robberies to drug use, to moral crimes. It's {{our duty to}} look at any crime that comes to us[...] [...] After the regime has fallen, {{we believe that the}} Muslim majority in Syria will ask for an Islamic state. Of course, it's very {{important to point out that}} some say the Islamic Sharia will cut off people's hands and heads, but it only applies to criminals. And to start off by killing, crucifying etc. That is not correct at all." [...] In response to being asked what the difference between the Islamic Front's and ISIL's version of sharia would be, he said, [...] "One of their mistakes is before the regime has fallen, and before they've established what in Sharia is called Tamkeen , they started applying Sharia, thinking God gave them permission to control the land and establish a Caliphate. This goes against the beliefs of religious scholars around the world. This is what [...] did wrong. This is going to cause a lot of trouble. Anyone who opposes [...] will be considered against Sharia and will be severely punished." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{report of}} the [...] "Swedish Government's Commission on New Religious Movements" [...] (1998) states that the great {{majority}} of members of new religious movements derive positive experiences from their subscription to ideas or doctrines that correspond to their personal needs—and that withdrawal from these movements is usually quite undramatic, as these people leave feeling enriched by a predominantly positive experience. Although the report describes that there are a small number of withdrawals that require support (100 out of 50,000+ people), the report did not recommend that any special resources be established for their rehabilitation, as these cases are very rare.The great majority of members of the new religious movements derive positive experience from their membership. They have subscribed to an idea or doctrine that corresponds to their personal needs. Membership is of limited duration in most cases. After two years, the majority have left the movement. This withdrawal is usually quite undramatic, and the people withdrawing feel enriched by a predominantly positive experience. The Commission does not recommend that special resources be established for the rehabilitation of withdraws. <b>The</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> too few in number and the problem picture too manifold for this: each individual can be expected to need help from several different care providers or facilitators.|$|E
