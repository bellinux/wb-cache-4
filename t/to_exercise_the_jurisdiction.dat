Distrust began to creep at a very rapid pace even into the ministerial ranks. The tory member for a large {{northern}} borough rose to resent “the inexpedient treatment of the Irishmen from a party point of view,” to protest against the ’straining and stretching of the law’ by the resident magistrates, to declare his opinion that these gentlemen were not qualified <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> entrusted to them, “and to denounce the folly of making English law unpopular in Ireland, and provoking the leaders of the Irish people by illegal and unconstitutional acts.”(266) These sentiments were notoriously shared to the full by many who sat around him. Nobody in those days, discredited as he was with his party, had a keener scent for the drift of popular feeling than Lord Randolph Churchill, and he publicly proclaimed that this sending of Irish members of parliament to prison in such numbers was a feature which he did not like. Further, he said that the fact of the government not thinking it safe for public meetings of any sort to be held, excited painful feelings in English minds.(267) All this was after the system had been in operation for two years. Even strong unionist organs in the Irish press could not stand it.(268) They declared that if (M150) the Irish, government wished to make the coercive system appear as odious as possible, they would act just as they were acting. They could only explain all these doings, not by “wrong-headedness or imbecility,” but by a strange theory that there must be deliberate treachery among the government agents.|$|E

40|$|In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court issued two holdings- {{the first}} covered the {{procedural}} {{aspects of the}} case, and the second addressed the merits. The Court issued a 5 - 4 decision holding {{that at least one}} Petitioner-Massachusetts-had standing <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the court. The majority reasoned that Massachusetts had 2 ̆ 2 special solicitude 2 ̆ 2 in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s standing analysis and that Massachusetts demonstrated the requisite injury-in-fact, traceability, and redressability to establish standing. The Court also ruled 5 - 4 that the EPA does have the statutory authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from new motor vehicles. The majority held that if the EPA elects not to regulate carbon dioxide under the CAA, the reason for refusing must be consistent with the CAA. The purpose of this Note is twofold: first, to analyze the reasoning used by the majority in determining that Massachusetts had standing and explore the effect that the majority 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning will have on future cases; second, to investigate the potential consequences of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision that carbon dioxide is an air pollutant under the language of the CAA. In order to analyze the Court 2 ̆ 7 s holding in Massachusetts v. EPA, it is necessary to first look at the underlying issue of global warming and the legal background of the CAA. In analyzing the procedural aspects of the case, it is necessary to look at the development of the standing doctrine and particularly its use in environmental cases. Part II of this Note explores the science surrounding climate change.

40|$|This article argues that, {{although}} {{choice of}} court agreements can be viewed from a procedural or contractual perspective, the predominant approach in Singapore and English law in respect of <b>the</b> exclusive <b>jurisdiction</b> agreement has been to give primacy to the rationale of the enforcement of a contractual bargain, tempered by a judicial discretion in its enforcement within the procedural jurisdictional context. It is also argued that {{the only difference between}} exclusive and non-exclusive jurisdiction agreements lies in the content and scope of the agreement between the parties, so the same contractual approach (as tempered by procedural considerations) should be applied in so far as the court is enforcing a contractual agreement. The main difficulty lies in determining the promissory content within a non-exclusive <b>jurisdiction</b> agreement. <b>The</b> implications of this analysis go beyond questions relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> of <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of <b>the</b> court.

50|$|Bacon helped {{secure the}} {{position}} of Archbishop of Canterbury for his friend Matthew Parker, and in his official capacity presided over the House of Lords when Elizabeth opened her first parliament. Though an implacable enemy of Mary, Queen of Scots, he opposed Cecil's policy of war against France, on financial grounds; but he favoured closer links with foreign Protestants, and {{was aware of the}} threat to England from the alliance between France and Scotland. In 1559 he was authorized <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>the</b> full <b>jurisdiction</b> of Lord Chancellor. In 1564 he fell temporarily into the royal disfavour and was dismissed from court, because Elizabeth suspected he was concerned in the publication of a pamphlet, A Declaration of the Succession of the Crowne Imperial of Ingland, by John Hales, which favoured the claim of Lady Catherine Grey (sister of Lady Jane Grey) to the English throne. Bacon's innocence having been admitted, he was restored to favour, and replied to a writing by Sir Anthony Browne, who had again asserted the rights of the House of Suffolk to which Lady Catherine belonged. He thoroughly distrusted Mary, Queen of Scots; objected to the proposal to marry her to Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk; and warned Elizabeth that serious consequences for England would follow her restoration. He seems to have disliked the proposed marriage between the English queen and François, Duke of Anjou, and his distrust of the Roman Catholics and the French was increased by the St Bartholomew's Day massacre. As a loyal English churchman he was ceaselessly interested in ecclesiastical matters, and made suggestions for the better observation of doctrine and discipline in the church.|$|R
5000|$|While the Pennoyer {{and later}} Shoe doctrines limit the maximum {{power of a}} {{sovereign}} state, courts must also have authorization <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>the</b> state's power; an individual state may choose to not grant its courts the full power {{that the state is}} Constitutionally permitted <b>to</b> <b>exercise.</b> Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of Federal courts (other than the Supreme Court) are statutorily-defined. Thus, a particular exercise of personal jurisdiction must not only be permitted by Constitutional doctrine, but be statutorily authorized as well. Under Pennoyer, personal jurisdiction was authorized by statutes authorizing service of process, but these methods of service often lacked because they required such service to be effected by officers of the state, such as sheriffs - an untenable method for defendants located outside of the state but still subject to jurisdiction due to their contacts with the state. Subsequent {{to the development of the}} Shoe Doctrine, states have enacted so-called long-arm statutes, by which courts in a state can serve process and thus exercise jurisdiction over a party located outside the state. The doctrine of International Shoe applies only in cases where there is no presence in the forum state. For example, if A committed a tort in State X. He is sued by B and B serves him with process just before he leaves State X before the flight was took off, the service would be valid and State X would have jurisdiction over A. If A did not comply with the final judgement passed by the courts of State X, B could enforce that judgement in the state where A resides under the full faith and credit clause of the US Constitution. There was one case where a defendant was served while the airplane was in the air over the forum State, and the federal district court held that this was valid service, since at law the territory of a state includes the airspace above the State.|$|R
5000|$|The {{court held}} that the defendant's [...] "out-of-state {{creation}} of an Internet web site that is accessible in New York, standing alone, does not provide personal jurisdiction over defendant in New York". New York's long-arm statute states that an out-of-state defendant must transact business within the state, and the cause of action must arise out of such a transaction, in order for jurisdiction to lie in New York. The court analogized to a previous case where advertisements directed toward consumers in New York were insufficient to satisfy the requirement of transacting business. It reasoned that Goldberger's website was not targeted at residents of New York or any other state in particular. His contacts were minimally intrusive, since he had not yet sold any products at the time the lawsuit was brought. On that basis, the court concluded that the website was [...] "analogous to an advertisement in a national publication." [...] Because placing an advertisement does not constitute transacting business under New York law, Goldenberg's activities did not constitute sufficient contacts with New York <b>to</b> justify <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> of <b>jurisdiction.</b> <b>The</b> opinion also made the policy argument that allowing activity in cyberspace to establish sufficient minimum contacts would be too broad an extension of personal jurisdiction.|$|R

In addition to imposing more extensive regulation of internal union affairs, it provided for amendments to the Wagner Act prohibiting certain union activities, such as certain secondary boycotts and certain picketing in connection with organizing activities, eliminated [...] "hot cargo" [...] agreements (in which prohibited employers from dealing with companies with labor disputes) and gave over to <b>the</b> states <b>jurisdiction</b> over matters on which <b>the</b> NLRB declined <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> its <b>jurisdiction.</b> <b>The</b> bill passed by a vote of 303-125, stunning labor officials both because it was substantially more anti-union than anything the Senate contemplated, including Kennedy's bill from 1957, and because they badly misjudged the results of the 1958 election.

In 1637, only 19 people remained in the town due to the effects and consequences of the Thirty Years War and plagues. In 1675, the governance of Waldburg-Zeil-Wurzach was established. In 1806, the Barony of Wurzach came under the suzerainty of Württemberg and was allocated to the Oberamt Leutkirch (administrative district of Leutkirch), a large neighbouring town. In 1813 and 1814, during the War of Liberation, 35,301 soldiers were being taken care of in Wurzach.

40|$|Two {{projects}} {{to create the}} international criminal courts were devised during the 20 th century. On 1 July 2002, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court entered into force. On 16 November 1937, the Convention for the Creation of an International Criminal Court was opened for signature at Geneva. The latter never entered into force, an event made contingent on the coming into force of its companion Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism, which also never occurred. The use {{to be made of}} law in each court forms the core of this discussion: the Rome Statute Court will rely on both vertical and horizontal approaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> of <b>jurisdiction,</b> and will utilise a harmonised approach to substantive criminal law; the 1937 court would have utilised domestic criminal law, in that the intent behind the 1937 convention was to make available an alternate forum, should the need arise. It is argued in particular that a horizontal approach to international criminal law may hold more seeds of future discord than a vertical approach, as harmonised law-making and enforcement lack a much-needed critical foundation. Crucially, the new International Criminal Court could greatly disturb the existing distribution of power and authority originally designed into the United Nations Charter, and effect a major shift in power politics, thus upsetting the balance between the principle of non-interference in state domestic affairs and the maintenance of international peace...|$|R
40|$|What {{should a}} court do when a lawsuit {{involving}} the same {{parties and the}} same issues is already pending {{in the court of}} another country? With the growth of transnational litigation, the issue of reactive, duplicative proceedings - and the waste inherent in such duplication - becomes a more common problem. The future does not promise change. In a modern, globalized world, litigants are increasingly tempted to forum shop among countries to find courts and law more favorably inclined to them than their opponents. The federal courts, however, do not yet have a coherent response to the problem. They apply at least three different approaches when deciding whether to stay or dismiss U. S. litigation {{in the face of a}} first-filed foreign proceeding. All three approaches, however, are undertheorized, fail to account for the costs of duplicative actions, and uncritically assume that domestic theory applies with equal force in the international context. Relying on domestic abstention principles, courts routinely refuse to stay duplicative actions believing that doing so would constitute an abdication of their 2 ̆ 2 unflagging obligation 2 ̆ 2 <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> <b>The</b> academic community in turn has yet to give the issue sustained attention, and a dearth of scholarship addresses the problem. This article offers a different way of thinking about the problem of duplicative foreign litigation. After describing the shortcomings of current approaches, it argues that when courts consider stay requests they must account for the breadth of their increasingly extraterritorial jurisdictional assertions. The article concludes that courts should adopt a modified lis pendens principle, and reverse the current presumption. Absent exceptional circumstances, courts should usually stay duplicative litigation so long as the party seeking the stay can establish that the first-filed foreign action has <b>jurisdiction</b> over <b>the</b> case under U. S. jurisdictional principles. This approach - pragmatic in its orientation, yet also more theoretically coherent than current law - would help avoid the wastes inherent in duplicative litigation, and better serve long-term U. S. interests...|$|R

The case description is as follows: [...] "Lance Paul Larsen, a resident of Hawaii, brought a claim against the Hawaiian Kingdom by its Council of Regency (“Hawaiian Kingdom”) {{on the grounds that the}} Government of the Hawaiian Kingdom is in continual violation of: (a) its 1849 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation with the United States of America, as well as the principles of international law laid down in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969 and (b) the principles of international comity, for allowing the unlawful imposition of American municipal laws over the claimant’s person within <b>the</b> territorial <b>jurisdiction</b> of <b>the</b> Hawaiian Kingdom. In determining whether to accept or decline <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> <b>the</b> Tribunal considered the questions of whether there was a legal dispute between the parties to the proceeding, and whether the tribunal could make a decision regarding that dispute, if the very subject matter of the decision would be the rights or obligations of a State not party to the proceedings. [...] The Tribunal underlined the many points of agreement between the parties, particularly with respect to the propositions that Hawaii was never lawfully incorporated into the United States, and that it continued to exist as a matter of international law. The Tribunal noted that if there existed a dispute, it concerned whether the respondent has fulfilled what both parties maintain is its duty to protect the Claimant, not in the abstract but against the acts of the United States of America as the occupant of the Hawaiian islands. Moreover, the United States’ actions would not give rise to a duty of protection in international law unless they were themselves unlawful in international law. The Tribunal concluded that it could not determine whether the Respondent has failed to discharge its obligations towards the Claimant without ruling on the legality of the acts of the United States of America - something the Tribunal was precluded from doing as the United States was not party to the case." ...|$|R
40|$|Despite all the {{attention}} it receives from both its supporters and critics, universal jurisdiction {{remains one of the}} more confused doctrines of international law. Indeed, while commentary has focused largely and unevenly on policy and normative arguments either favoring or undercutting the desirability of its exercise, a straightforward legal analysis breaking down critical aspects of this extraordinary form of jurisdiction remains conspicuously missing. Yet universal jurisdiction’s increased practice by states calls out for such a clear descriptive understanding. This Essay engages this under-treated area. It offers to explicate a basic, but overlooked, feature of the law of universal jurisdiction: If national courts prosecute on grounds of universal jurisdiction, they must use the international legal definitions—contained in customary international law—of the universal crimes they adjudicate; otherwise their exercise of universal <b>jurisdiction</b> contradicts <b>the</b> very international law upon which it purports to rely. The Essay argues that this legal feature derives from the distinctively symbiotic nature of universal prescriptive <b>jurisdiction</b> (<b>the</b> power to apply law to certain persons or things) and universal adjudicative <b>jurisdiction</b> (<b>the</b> power to subject certain persons or things to judicial process). Unlike other bases of jurisdiction in international law, the prescriptive substance of universal jurisdiction authorizes and circumscribes universal adjudicative jurisdiction; it defines not only the universal crimes themselves, but also the judicial competence for all courts wishing <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> universal <b>jurisdiction.</b> <b>The</b> Essay looks to chart out some important implications of this thesis for the real-world practice of universal jurisdiction; it evaluates how most easily to determine the customary definitions of universal crimes, to detect breaches of international law by courts that manipulate subjectively those definitions, and to enforce against such illicit manipulation. The Essay contends that while some definitional aspects invariably remain to be ironed out by state practice, the provisions of widely-ratified and longstanding international treaties provide generally the best record of the core customary definitions of universal crimes, and accordingly supply not only a harmonized point of departure for courts wishing properly <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> universal jurisdiction, but also a useful means for detecting breaches of international law by overzealous courts seeking only to exploit universal jurisdiction for purely political or sensationalist ends. The framework presented thus addresses concerns that universal jurisdiction hazards unbridled abuse. As the Essay argues, the law of universal jurisdiction does not; rather, it prescribes legal limits. And the Essay concludes that in the end these limits are enforced not by those states exercising universal jurisdiction, but rather by other jurisdictionally-interested states—that is, most often by those states whose national citizens are the subject of foreign universal jurisdiction proceedings...|$|R
