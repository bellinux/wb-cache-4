5|$|The Arabization of the Ayyubid ruling {{families}} differed starkly from <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> their armies, which lacked cultural cohesion, with Turks and Kurds {{dominating the}} cavalry and nomadic Turcomans and Arabs filling <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> the infantry. These groups typically {{settled in the}} pastoral areas outside of the cities, the centers of cultural life, and as such they were relatively isolated from the Arabic-dominant urban environment. This isolation allowed them to preserve their traditions. It is thought that Saladin spoke Turkish to his military commanders. Like their Fatimid predecessors, the Ayyubid rulers of Egypt maintained a substantial force of mamluks (military slaves). By {{the first half of}} the 13th century mamluks were mostly drawn from Kipchak Turks and Circassians and there is strong evidence that these forces continued to speak Kipchak Turkish.|$|E
