According to Argentine graphic artist Rep, the artwork conveys a grotesque, dramatic flavor and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> album should be taken seriously but not too seriously.|$|E
25|$|Pittsburgh {{entered the}} game as seven-point {{favorites}} over Arizona. Major factors for this included {{the view that the}} Steelers' defense was better than that of the Cardinals and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> AFC was an overall better conference than the NFC.|$|E
25|$|Of all {{the reasons}} Lori and Corey found for {{creating}} a bridge between Trial by Fire and Shadows of Darkenss, the most compelling was <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hero character simply hadn't matured enough to face the very grim challenges awaiting him in Transylvania.|$|E

25|$|In the story, Piro has extreme {{difficulty}} understanding Megatokyos female characters, {{making him}} {{for the most part}} ignorant of <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character Nanasawa Kimiko has for him, though he has become much more aware of her attraction as the series progressed. Gallagher has commented <b>that</b> Piro is <b>the</b> focal point of emotional damage, while his friend, Largo, takes the physical damage in the comic.|$|R
25|$|The architects {{wanted the}} {{building}} to give Bloomington residents <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> courthouse belonged to them. To encourage this feeling the entrances on all four sides of the building are identical, a way to welcome people from all directions. Wanting to balance the feeling of symmetry {{with a sense of}} power Reeves and Baile created an identical hierarchy in each facade through the use of an entrance arch, enhanced vertically by columns and topped off with a pediment. The exterior also makes use of many balustrades in the roof and other levels on the exterior. Also included are detailed egg-and-dart molding, and hood molding.|$|E
25|$|On 16 May 1901, Ament {{addressing}} {{guests at}} the third annual Asiatic Society of America dinner in New York, again defended himself and his fellow missionaries:The missionaries in China, of whom I am proud to be one, represent a class of American citizens whose work in the Orient have been purposefully misrepresented....The missionaries' words have been twisted, wring interpretations made. The persistency of work like this can only justify <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> root of this un-American warfare is due, {{not so much to}} what is seen or known of the deeds of missionaries, but the opposition to Christianity itself. The purpose was fixed before China was reached at all, and this murderous spirit stops not at injustice to individuals.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> early 20th {{century was}} {{an era of}} {{economic}} growth due to technological advances contrasted dramatically with {{the standard of living}} of lower social classes. The growth of the previous decades led to an unprecedented population explosion starting in 1929. The Great Depression caused the collapse of the nitrate industry in the north, leaving 60,000 unemployed, which added to the decline in agricultural exports, resulting in a total number for the unemployed to be about 300,000 nationwide. These unemployed workers saw Santiago and its booming industry as the only chance to survive. Many migrants arrived in Santiago with nothing and thousands had to survive on the streets due to the great difficulty in finding a place they could rent. Widespread disease, including tuberculosis, claimed the lives of hundreds of the homeless. Unemployment and living costs increased dramatically whilst the salaries of the population of Santiago fell.|$|E

60|$|These {{being his}} views, <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sight awoke in him of this pair declaring their holy {{love in the}} accustomed, human fashion, can {{scarcely}} be measured and are certainly beyond description.

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{commented on}} Berri's {{exploration}} of human character, [...] "the relentlessness of human greed, <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> land {{is so important}} the human spirit can be sacrificed to it". Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars.|$|E
500|$|Some {{criticism}} {{came from}} <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> program was not educational. Others {{were concerned about}} the waste of food products like beans and eggs in physical challenges and obstacles. In 1989, television and film critic Jeffrey Lyons wrote that he [...] "wouldn't dream of proclaiming that Super Sloppy Double Dare is good for your child. But what's wrong with watching an admittedly dumb—but hilarious—program just for fun?" ...|$|E
500|$|Following that, it {{was decided}} to reinvent the series. Mikami took over directorial duties from Shibata and began working on the version that was released. In an {{interview}} with Game Informer, Mikami explained his decision to shift to a new gameplay system is due to <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> older system is [...] "more of the same" [...] after playing Resident Evil 0. He says that he only felt nervous once more when playing with the newer system.|$|E

500|$|Corporations are {{increasingly}} recognizing {{the benefits of}} green marketing, although {{there is often a}} thin line between doing so for its own benefit and for social responsibility reasons. The term “greenwashing” refers to all industries that adopt outwardly green acts with an underlying purpose to increase profits. The primary objective of greenwashing is to provide consumers with <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> organization is taking the necessary steps to responsibly manage its ecological footprint. In reality, the company may be doing very little that is environmentally beneficial ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the strike, Pittston was a strong coal company and the area was full of strikers protesting. [...] Since the strike, many of Pittston's coal plants have been sold to Alpha Natural Resources, which is now in the nation’s top three coal companies, in order to pay for the health care for the miners. After the strike ended, Moss 3 was {{demolished}} and a new plant was built and named after it, and the recreational park that became Camp Solidarity has been reclaimed by nature and is now an open field. Though the physical aspects of the area have changed since the strike has ended, what has not changed is <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> miners of Pittston accomplished – a win for their own benefits as well as benefits for the UMWA. The union’s actions during the strike made it possible for thousands of miners to receive health care and retirement funds for years to come.|$|E
50|$|Phil Jones {{has written}} {{in his book}} Drama as Therapy, Theatre as Living that there are nine core {{processes}} {{at the heart of}} drama therapy. These include projective identification and dramatic distancing. Projective identification is the process whereby a person feels <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other is unable to access themselves. Dramatic distancing refers to <b>the</b> way <b>that</b> emotional and psychological problems can be accessed easier through metaphor. The client has a distanced relationship through metaphor to these problems that makes them easier to tolerate.|$|R

500|$|The author Sheila Whiteley {{attributes}} Sgt. Pepper underlying philosophy {{not only}} to the drug culture, but also to metaphysics and the non-violent approach of the flower power movement. The musicologist Oliver Julien views the album as an embodiment of [...] "the social, the musical, and more generally, the cultural changes of the 1960s". The American psychologist and counterculture figure Timothy Leary contends that the LP [...] "gave a voice to <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> old ways were over... it came along at the right time" [...] and stressed the need for cultural change based on a peaceful agenda. The album's primary value, according to Moore, is its ability to [...] "capture, more vividly than almost anything contemporaneous, its own time and place". Whiteley agrees, crediting the album with [...] "provid a historical snapshot of England during the run-up to the Summer of Love". Several scholars have applied a hermeneutic strategy to their analysis of Sgt. Pepper lyrics, identifying loss of innocence and the dangers of overindulgence in fantasies or illusions as the most prominent themes.|$|E
500|$|Like Rivette's earlier film La Belle Noiseuse, {{the main}} themes are romantic longing, impermanence, and identity, but this film adds {{the themes of}} mortality, chance, and destiny, and motifs are {{repeated}} from Rivette's Celine and Julie Go Boating. The name of Julien's cat, Nevermore, evokes Poe's The Raven and its similar themes of death and longing. Julien's work as a clockmaker, literally trying to repair time, is an obvious metaphor, and the film is also timeless, giving no indication of when it is set. The blackmail sub-plot is a device to help tell the central love story between Marie and Julien and to explain Marie's situation; Julien is an unlikely blackmailer and Madame X's benevolence towards him is surprising. The plot features dream logic impinging on reality: Senses of Cinema highlighted the role of [...] "outlandish chance" [...] and Film Comment noted <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> characters are inventing or re-enacting the narrative. Marie may be aware that she {{is part of a}} narrative, but she still lacks control over her fate. Michael Atkinson believed that Rivette was working in the [...] "border world between narrative meaning and cinematic artifice".|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{went to the}} Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and U.S. Customs {{early on}} with the script {{and told them that}} they were trying to present as {{detailed}} and accurate a picture of the current drug war as possible. The DEA and Customs pointed out inaccuracies in the script. In addition, they gave the production team access to the border checkpoint to Mexico, as shown in the film during the scene in which Wakefield and his people talk with border officials. Despite the assistance, the DEA did not try to influence the content of the script. Soderbergh said Traffic had influences from the films of Richard Lester and Jean-Luc Godard. He also spent time analyzing The Battle of Algiers and Z, which, according to the director, had <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> footage was [...] "caught" [...] and not staged. Another inspiration was Alan J. Pakula's film All the President's Men because of its ability to tackle serious issues while being entertaining. In the opening credits of his film, Soderbergh tried to replicate the typeface from All the President's Men and the placement on-screen at the bottom left-hand corner. Analyzing this film helped the director deal with the large cast and working in many different locations for Traffic.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the tales}} are from Roman history, but each section has an {{appendix}} consisting of extracts from {{the annals of}} other peoples, principally the Greeks. The exposition exhibits strongly the two currents of feeling which are intermingled by almost every Roman writer of <b>the</b> Empire—the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Romans of the writer's own day are degenerate creatures when confronted with their own republican predecessors, and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that,</b> however degenerate, <b>the</b> latter-day Romans still tower above the other peoples of the world, and in particular are morally superior to the Greeks.|$|R
500|$|Like BuddyTVs Don Williams, {{fans were}} very wary at first of {{bringing}} in female characters to the male-dominated show. To make matters worse, Kripke wrote a lackluster scene intended {{solely for the}} audition process. Fans quickly came across it on casting sites, and developed <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character [...] "really [...] ". However, Kripke believed that fans would change their minds about Ruby after learning {{that she was a}} demon. By the middle of the third season, Kripke felt enough fans were [...] "responding positively to vindicate the character", and that most were [...] "finally embracing her" [...] by the third season finale, with Cassidy's version of Ruby even being dubbed a [...] "fan favorite" [...] later on. When the character returns in the fourth season, she is much different than her third season counterpart. Cortese felt that while the drastic change made fans angry, the flashbacks provided in [...] "I Know What You Did Last Summer" [...] shed some light on Ruby's new mindset and made fans more accepting of the character. However, the overall criticisms towards Cortese's performance made her reluctant to return for an episode in the sixth season, although she eventually accepted when she learned she would be portraying herself.|$|E
500|$|Albert Lasker, {{a wealthy}} {{advertising}} magnate, responded to these calls to help Frank. Lasker contributed personal funds and arranged {{a public relations}} effort in support of Frank. In Atlanta, {{during the time of}} the extraordinary motion, Lasker coordinated Frank's meetings with the press and coined the slogan [...] "The Truth Is on the March" [...] to characterize the efforts of Frank's defense team. He persuaded prominent figures such as Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Jane Addams to make statements supporting Frank. During the commutation hearing, Vice President Thomas R. Marshall weighed in, as did many leading magazine and newspaper editors, including Herbert Croly, editor of the New Republic; C.P.J. Mooney, editor of the Chicago Tribune; Mark Sullivan, editor of Collier's; R. E. Stafford, editor of the Daily Oklahoman; and D. D. Moore, editor of the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Adolph Ochs, publisher of The New York Times, became involved about the same time as Lasker, organizing a prolonged campaign advocating for a new trial for Frank. Both Ochs and Lasker attempted to heed Louis Marshall's warnings about antagonizing the [...] "sensitiveness of the southern people and engender <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> north is criticizing the courts and the people of Georgia." [...] Dinnerstein writes that these attempts failed, [...] "because many Georgians interpreted every item favorable to Frank as a hostile act." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} critical acclaim. Christopher John Farley of Time {{called the}} album [...] "the group's most ambitious and accomplished work yet". Farley wrote, [...] "One gets <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band [...] charged ahead on gut instincts; the sheer {{scope of the}} album (28 songs) didn't allow for second-guessing or contrivance." [...] Time selected Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness as the best {{album of the year}} in its year-end [...] "Best of 1995" [...] list. Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A rating; reviewer David Browne praised the group's ambition and wrote, [...] "Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is more than just the work of a tortured, finicky pop obsessive. Corgan presents himself as one of the last true believers: someone for whom spewing out this much music results in some sort of high art for the ages. He doesn't seem concerned with persistent alterna-rock questions of 'selling out', and good for him: He's aiming for something bigger and all-conquering." [...] IGN gave the album a score of 9.5 out of 10 and said, [...] "As the band's magnum opus it single-handedly changed the face of Alternative Rock. That said, it's not just music, but a work of art." [...] The Music Box gave it all five stars and said, [...] "Indeed, for all its melodramatic self-indulgence, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness {{is one of the best}} double albums of new material to be released by anyone in a long time." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{turning point}} in her life came in 1962-63, when she took the {{opportunity}} to go to Istanbul University on a fellowship as an exchange student. Subsequently she became a student of Ömer Lüfti Barkan, one of the founding fathers of Ottoman history and an editor of Annales. When she first read Fernand Braudel at Barkan’s insistence, she “had <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>the</b> sort of thing I wanted to do.” She wrote her doctoral thesis at Hamburg on a set of documents that a late 16th-century vizier submitted to his sultan discussing Ottoman politics at the time.|$|R
