40|$|AGN {{feedback}} {{in massive}} galaxies and galaxy clusters {{can be thought}} of as a naturally occurring control system which plays a significant role in regulating both star formation and the X-ray luminosity of the surrounding hot gas. By analogy with the principle of least action in classical mechanics, AGN feedback must also be optimal, in some sense. Therefore, the observed behavior of a system, if interpreted correctly, should provide valuable information about the underlying physical principles which govern feedback. For example, AGN heating in elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters seems to occur in relatively discrete episodes [1][2], as opposed to operating continuously at an approximately constant rate. Empirically, this occurs because AGN and star formation in Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) seem to be triggered whenever the central cooling time of the Intra-cluster Medium (ICM) falls below 0. 5 Gyr [3][4]. However, if this is the only consideration, why isn’t AGN heating perpetually triggered and quenched on very short timescales as the cooling time varies around the <b>triggering</b> <b>value?</b> Indeed, if this was the case, the AGN radio emission would appear to be continuous, in conflict with observations. One possibility is that there are time delays associated with the inflow of material on to the black hole and the dissipation of energy output from the AGN. Such time-delayed AGN heating would cause the system to overshoot its equilibrium state and oscillate between longer-lived “on...|$|E

However, in outpatients, {{the rate of}} peripheral manual blood smear reviews is uncertain, as {{is the effect of}} historical results on this rate. Methods: In a prospective cohort study of 687, 955 members of a health maintenance organization, we extracted 39, 759 consecutive automated CBC test results and determined the rate of manual peripheral smear reviews that were indicated using different triggering criteria, and historical results. Results: Individual triggering values increased from 10. 7 % to 19. 5 % when comparing our criteria to those of the consensus criteria. The proportion of CBC test results with at least one <b>triggering</b> <b>value</b> was 7. 2 % using our criteria, compared to 13. 9 % with the inclusion of a mean corpuscular volume &# 60; 75 and a plus one immature granulocyte flag according to the consensus committee.

Conclusions: The peripheral smear review rate in outpatients using the consensus criteria was higher than with our less stringent criteria. If historical data are available and no clinical utility is demonstrated for the additional consensus criteria, an acceptable out-patient review rate might be as low as 2. 6 %.

When I engage in this research area longer and deeper, I gradually realise that there are many unresolved problems in the scientific derivation of water and sediment quality guidelines (i. e., <b>trigger</b> <b>values).</b> In this talk, I will discuss and highlight some of the major challenges in search of the Holy Grail, i. e. ecologically relevant <b>trigger</b> <b>values,</b> for protecting aquatic ecosystems from chemical pollution. First, I will examine the possible ecological impacts of toxic substances when they enter into an aquatic ecosystem. This will lead to discussion on a series of questions such as: What should we protect?, Should we protect all species?, Should we primarily focus on protection of ecological function? etc. Second, I will review and evaluate the conventional methods for determining predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) and <b>trigger</b> <b>values.</b> In particular, I will elucidate various problems and uncertainties in using laboratory ecotoxicity data and species sensitivity distributions to derive PNECs. Third, I will argue that fundamental field-based study on ecology and biodiversity in conjunction with pollution monitoring is indispensable, as such information is vital to validate or refine the <b>trigger</b> <b>values.</b> Finally, I will suggest some possible solutions and advocate that more research effort should be made to fortify the ecological realism in derivation of the <b>trigger</b> <b>value.</b> The EnviroTox 2011 Conference: Sharing Knowledge for a Healthier Environment, Darwin, Australia, 17 - 20 April 2011...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we propose {{for the first time}} an {{approach}} for the tentative derivation of effect-based water quality <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> for an apical endpoint, the cytotoxicity measured by the bioluminescence inhibition in Vibrio fischeri. The <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> were derived for the Australian Drinking Water Guideline and the Australian Guideline for Water Recycling as examples, but the algorithm can be adapted to any other set of guideline values. In the first step, a Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) describing the 50 % effect concentrations, EC 50, was established using chemicals known to act according to the nonspecific mode of action of baseline toxicity. This QSAR described the effect of most of the chemicals in these guidelines satisfactorily, with the exception of antibiotics, which were more potent than predicted by the baseline toxicity QSAR. The mixture effect of 10 - 56 guideline chemicals mixed at various fixed concentration ratios (equipotent mixture ratios and ratios of the guideline values) was adequately described by concentration addition model of mixture toxicity. Ten water samples were then analysed and 5 - 64 regulated chemicals were detected (from a target list of over 200 chemicals). These detected chemicals were mixed in the ratios of concentrations detected and their mixture effect was predicted by concentration addition. Comparing the effect of these designed mixtures with the effect of the water samples, it became evident that less than 1 % of effect could be explained by known chemicals, making it imperative to derive effect-based <b>trigger</b> <b>values.</b> The effect-based water quality <b>trigger</b> <b>value,</b> EBT-EC 50, was calculated from the mixture effect concentration predicted for concentration-dditive mixture effects of all chemicals in a given guideline divided by the sum of the guideline concentrations for individual components, and dividing by an extrapolation factor that accounts for the number of chemicals contained in the guidelines and for model uncertainties. While this concept was established using the example of Australian recycled water, it can be easily adapted to any other set of water quality guidelines for organic micropollutants. The cytotoxicity based <b>trigger</b> <b>value</b> cannot be used in isolation, it must be applied in conjunction with effect-based <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> targeting critical specific modes of action such as estrogenicity or photosynthesis inhibition.

30|$|The {{interpretation}} of triggers is handled by different adaptation layers. In general, an adaptation layer is a process, {{or part of}} a process, that is able to interface with the trigger communication module and thereby receive triggers.

40|$|To {{screen for}} {{hormonal}} activity in water samples, highly sensitive in vitro CALUX bioassays are available which allow detection of estrogenic (ERα), androgenic (AR), progestagenic (PR), and glucocorticoid (GR) activities. This paper presents <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> for the ERα, AR, PR, and GR CALUX bioassays for agonistic hormonal activities in (drinking) water, which define a level above which human health risk cannot be waived a priori and additional examination of specific endocrine activity may be warranted. The <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> {{are based on}} 1) acceptable or tolerable daily intake (ADI/TDI) values of specific compounds, 2) pharmacokinetic factors defining their bioavailability, 3) estimations of the bioavailability of unknown compounds with equivalent hormonal activity, 4) relative endocrine potencies, and 5) physiological, and drinking water allocation factors. As a result, <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> of 3. 8 ng 17 β-estradiol (E 2) -equivalents (eq) /L, 11 ng dihydrotestosterone (DHT) -eq/L, 21 ng dexamethasone (DEX) -eq/L, and 333 ng Org 2058 -eq/L were derived.

For instance, at one specific drinking water production site ERα and AR (but no GR and PR) activities were detected in drinking water, however, these levels are at least a factor 83 smaller than the respective <b>trigger</b> <b>values,</b> and therefore no human health risks are to be expected from hormonal activity in Dutch drinking water from this site...|$|R

40|$|Cell-based bioassays are {{becoming}} increasingly popular in water quality assessment. The new generations of reporter-gene assays are very sensitive and effects are often detected in very clean water types such as drinking water and recycled water. For monitoring applications it is therefore imperative to derive <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> that differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable effect levels. In this proof-of-concept paper, we propose a statistical method to read directly across from chemical guideline <b>values</b> to <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> without the need to perform in vitro to in vivo extrapolations. The derivation is based on matching effect concentrations with existing chemical guideline values and filtering out appropriate chemicals that are responsive in the given bioassays at concentrations {{in the range of}} the guideline values. To account for the mixture effects of many chemicals acting together in a complex water sample, we propose bioanalytical equivalents that integrate the effects of groups of chemicals with the same mode of action that act in a concentration-additive manner. Statistical distribution methods are proposed to derive a specific effect-based trigger bioanalytical equivalent concentration (EBT-BEQ) for each bioassay of environmental interest that targets receptor-mediated toxicity. Even bioassays that are indicative of the same mode of action have slightly different numeric <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> due to differences in their inherent sensitivity. The algorithm was applied to 18 cell-based bioassays and 11 provisional effect-based trigger bioanalytical equivalents were derived as an illustrative example using the 349 chemical guideline values protective for human health of the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling. We illustrate the applicability using the example of a diverse set of water samples including recycled water. Most recycled water samples were compliant with the proposed triggers while wastewater effluent would not have been compliant with a few. The approach is readily adaptable to any water type and guideline or regulatory framework and can be expanded from the protection goal of human health to environmental protection targets. While this work constitutes a proof of principle, the applicability remains limited at present due to insufficient experimental bioassay data on individual regulated chemicals and the derived effect-based <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> are of course only provisional. Once the experimental database is expanded and made more robust, the proposed effect-based <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> may provide guidance in a regulatory context. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
