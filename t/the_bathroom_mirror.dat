500|$|Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank: Chosen {{out of six}} {{unwanted}} pregnancies and {{the first}} child to be legally adopted by a corporation, Truman is unaware that his daily life is broadcast continuously around the world. He has {{a job in the}} insurance business and a lovely wife, but he eventually notices that his environment is not what it seems to be. Robin Williams was considered for the role, but Weir cast Carrey after seeing him in [...] because Carrey's performance reminded him of Charlie Chaplin. Carrey took the opportunity to proclaim himself as a dramatic actor, rather than being typecast in comedic roles. Carrey, who was then normally paid $20 million per film, agreed to do The Truman Show for $12 million. Carrey and Weir initially found working together on set difficult (Carrey's contract gave him the power to demand rewrites), but Weir was impressed with Carrey's improvisational skills, and the two became more interactive. The scene in which Truman declares [...] "this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy" [...] to <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>mirror</b> was Carrey's idea.|$|E

Desperate to reach Mary's spirit, Claire invites her friend Jody (Diana Scarwid) to join her for a séance in her <b>bathroom.</b> <b>The</b> séance provides no results except for the dog scaring them, so Jody leaves after Claire confides that Norman treats her like a child due to her car accident a year before and the recent departure of their daughter. Claire then cleans out <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> but then returns to it with a full bath tub and a steamy message on <b>the</b> <b>bathroom's</b> <b>mirror</b> that reads [...] "You know".

Mary visits her the next day and apologizes for the misunderstanding, explaining that she briefly left her husband because of their volatile fights with each other.

2500|$|Until 2003, Walken had a {{recurring}} SNL sketch called [...] "The Continental", in which Walken played a [...] "suave ladies' man" [...] who in reality cannot {{do anything to}} keep a woman (a neighbor in his apartment building) from giving him the cold shoulder. Though he is outwardly chivalrous, his more perverted tendencies inevitably drive away his date over his pleading objections. For instance, he invites the woman to wash up in his bathroom; once she is inside, it becomes obvious that <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>mirror</b> is a two-way mirror when he is seen lighting up a cigarette.

40|$|Suggesting that {{bathrooms}} in film {{are primarily}} theorized as transgressive spaces of violence, vulnerability, disorder and disturbing acts, Glen Donnar&# 039;s work adopts a different stance, focusing on {{encounters with the}} self and/as other in <b>bathroom</b> <b>mirrors,</b> whereby <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> arguably becomes a space of revelation albeit one which discloses inadequacy, difference and transformation. His chapter explores the many contradictory significances of domestic <b>bathrooms</b> and <b>mirrors</b> for younger men across key depictions from and of the 1980 s in American film. The simultaneously physical and metaphorical, real and unreal characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> disturb <b>bathroom</b> and male protagonist alike, {{in large part because}} of its ambivalent capacity to both reveal and distort. Donnar considers <b>the</b> filmic <b>bathroom</b> finally a revelatory, heterotopic space that can neither conceal nor contain male inadequacy, shame or monstrosity confirmed through the mirrored encounter of the self...|$|R

Louise and Gene resolve to get back at Tammy by scaring her on Halloween night when the older kids plan to enter a mausoleum in the nearby cemetery. Tina surprises them by joining the group and they head into the mausoleum, which immediately shuts and traps them inside in complete darkness. Louise takes this opportunity to steal the box and fill it with bugs from the restaurant and gives it back to Tammy to open.
