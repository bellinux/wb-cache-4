5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of <b>the</b> <b>knots</b> measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E
5|$|Abby Fairgate (formerly Cunningham, Ewing and Sumner) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the CBS soap opera Knots Landing, a long-running serial about middle class {{life on the}} fictional cul-de-sac known as Seaview Circle in Los Angeles, California. She was played by actress Donna Mills between 1980 and 1989. Abby was created by producer David Jacobs as one of Knots Landing earliest characters. She debuted in the first episode of the second season. Mills remained a principal actor in the series until she left in its tenth season. She returned for the two-part series finale to provide closure for the fans. The character made her last television appearance in 1997, when she appeared in <b>the</b> <b>Knots</b> Landing reunion series , and was reunited with former cast members.|$|E

30|$|The {{grades of}} lamina {{specimens}} were measured by machine stress-rated grader (MGFE- 251, Japan). The localized MOE was recorded for reflecting the lengthwise variation in each lamina. The KAR {{was defined as}} <b>the</b> ratio of <b>knot</b> area to <b>the</b> cross-sectional area. <b>Knot</b> images on four surfaces of a lamina were captured using an image-processing system developed by Kim et al. [14, 15] (see Fig.  2). Knots were classified according to <b>the</b> <b>knot</b> area type in ASTM D 3737 [16]. <b>The</b> <b>knot</b> area type is triangle or equilibrium quadrilateral shapes. <b>The</b> <b>knot</b> area was calculated using <b>the</b> <b>knot</b> length at perpendicular to longitudinal direction. <b>The</b> calculated <b>knot</b> area divided by cross-sectional area of lamina. <b>The</b> <b>knot</b> length was detected from <b>the</b> <b>knot</b> image and <b>the</b> KAR was automatically calculated using the Matlab software (2014 a, The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA).

25|$|Weaving {{normally}} begins {{from the}} bottom of the loom, by passing a number of wefts through the warps to form a base to start from. Knots of dyed wool, cotton or silk threads are then tied in rows around consecutive sets of adjacent warps. As more rows are tied to the foundation, these knots become the pile of the rug. Between each row of knots, one or more shots of weft are passed to keep <b>the</b> <b>knots</b> fixed. The wefts are then beaten down by a comb-like instrument, the comb beater, to further compact and secure the newly-woven row. Depending on the fineness of the weave, the quality of the materials and the expertise of the weavers, the knot count of a handmade rug can vary anywhere from 16 to 800 knots per square inch.|$|E
25|$|A family story {{initially}} recounts {{an actual}} historical event concerning named family members. Seasoned {{with time and}} re-telling, the story gets revised and honed to express specific values and character traits valued in the family. Instead of historical accuracies, the narration becomes a medium to re-state and re-enforce shared values of the family group. These stories generally {{take the form of}} an anecdote and follow the pattern of many common traditional tales. A favorite family story involves how the parents met, or how they decided on the one true partner among several. In one family, if the story is to be believed, the prospective bride had to untie all <b>the</b> <b>knots</b> in the string to demonstrate her care and diligence. Another family tells how the young couple got stuck {{at the top of a}} Ferris wheel when he proposed, and she had to either say yes or jump. Given time and repetition, the anecdotes serve to shape the family story as a whole, populating it with real individuals and historical events made personal. In their transmission, these stories serve to codify the norms of behavior within the family.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} size {{distribution}} of spontaneous knots on semiflexible chains confined in square cross-section channels using Monte Carlo simulations. <b>The</b> most probable <b>knot</b> size, i. e. <b>the</b> metastable <b>knot</b> size, {{is found to}} vary nonmonotonically with the channel size. In the case of weak confinement, <b>the</b> metastable <b>knot</b> size is larger than <b>the</b> <b>knot</b> size in bulk because the segments within <b>the</b> <b>knot</b> feel less channel confinement than the segments outside <b>the</b> <b>knot,</b> and <b>the</b> channel pushes <b>the</b> segments into <b>knot</b> cores to reduce the overall free energy. Conversely, {{in the case of}} strong confinement, <b>the</b> metastable <b>knot</b> size is smaller than the one in bulk because the segments within <b>the</b> <b>knot</b> experience more channel confinement, and the channel expels segments from <b>the</b> <b>knot</b> core. We demonstrate that a simple theory can capture this nonmonotonic behavior and quantitatively explain <b>the</b> metastable <b>knot</b> size {{as a function of the}} channel size. These results may have implications for tuning the channel size to either generate or screen knots. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART).

50|$|To tie the Windsor, {{place the}} tie {{around your neck}} and cross the broad end of the tie {{in front of the}} narrow end. Then fold the broad end behind the narrow end and push it up through the inside of the loop around your neck.

25|$|A few knots {{have become}} more or less {{standard}} for attaching the {{various parts of the}} fly lines and backing, etc., together. A detailed discussion of most of these knots is available in any good book on fly fishing. Some of <b>the</b> <b>knots</b> that are in most every fly angler's arsenal are: the improved clinch knot which is commonly used to attach the fly to the leader, the overhand slip knot or arbor knot which is used to attach the backing to the spool, the albright knot which can be used to attach the fly line to the backing. A loop can also be put in fly line backing using a bimini twist. Often, a loop is added to the business end of the fly line to facilitate the connection to the leader. This loop may take one of several forms. It may be formed by creating a loop in the end of the fly line itself or by adding a braided loop or a loop of monofilament nylon (as in Gray's Loop). Alternatively, a single length of monofilament nylon, or fluorocarbon, may be tied {{to the end of the}} fly line using a nail or tube knot or a needle knot. A loop can then be tied at the end of this monofilament butt length or butt section using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, to which the tapered or untapered leader, also looped using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, may in turn be connected via a loop to loop connection. The use of loop to loop connections between the fly line and the leader provides a quick and convenient way to change or replace a tapered leader. Many commercially produced tapered leaders come with a pre-tied loop connection.|$|E

500|$|Two more {{issues are}} {{addressed}} in the Sunday Herald article, {{but not in the}} Daily Mail article. The first is of <b>the</b> <b>knots</b> used to tie up Carol's body [...] <b>the</b> <b>knots</b> on Carol's body were mostly granny knots, of which {{there was no evidence that}} Gordon ever used [...] indeed during the trial he was specifically asked this, and he responded, [...] "I do not use granny knots". The granny knot is always a mistake, used by someone who should have used a reef knot; those learning knot-tying frequently make this mistake. Gordon Park, an experienced knot-tyer, would likely never use a granny knot, and their frequent appearance on the body of Carol is strong evidence that it was not Gordon who tied them. The article also claims that the evidence of knots was irrelevant anyway, as climbers and yachtsmen were so common in the area. The other piece of evidence related to another rock taken from the lakebed, which had supposedly come from the Parks' roof. However, the prosecution eventually admitted that Westmoreland green slate had been worked in the area for hundreds of years, and could have come from anywhere. The Herald also mentions the fact that the police files from the original missing persons inquiry into Carol Park had gone missing themselves, but does not draw any conclusions from this.|$|E
