5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is coincidentally in the area, {{taking a}} {{vacation}} in Maine. After stumbling upon the carnage in <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store,</b> Scully telephones Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and describes the bizarre situation. Mulder tells Scully that the incident might {{be the result of}} witchcraft or sorcery. Scully, however, can find no physical evidence that might support his theory. Assisted by the local police, Scully reviews the store's surveillance footage and notices Melissa Turner leaving the scene, the only customer unaffected. Jack Bonsaint, the police chief, tells Scully that some townspeople believe Melissa to be a witch. Deputy Buddy Riggs informs Melissa that Bonsaint will be questioning her. Riggs promises to help Melissa, but she warns him to stay away.|$|E
5|$|Eladio escapes as he {{is being}} deported, killing a truck driver in the process. A {{clinical}} exam on the driver shows his death {{was caused by a}} rapid growth of Trichophyton — the Athlete's foot fungus. Scully brings samples of the fatal fungi to a mycologist who discovers that their abnormally rapid growth was caused by an unidentifiable enzyme. This revelation leads Scully to suspect Eladio of being an unwitting carrier of the enzyme, necessitating his immediate capture. Eladio, seeking to return to Mexico, meets with his cousin Gabrielle to ask for money. He works with a construction foreman for the day to make the money. Soledad comes after him, seeking to kill him, but finds the foreman dead. Eladio escapes in the foreman's truck and heads to <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store</b> where Gabrielle works, spreading the fungal growth. The agents later confront Soledad at the supermarket, discovering another dead victim of the fungus.|$|E
5|$|Rymkus {{was born}} in Royalton, Illinois, {{the son of a}} Lithuanian {{immigrant}} coal miner who owned a small grocery store. After his father was shot and killed outside <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store,</b> Rymkus and his family moved to the Back of the Yards neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. With family finances tight, he took a number of odd jobs, including working as a laborer and delivering newspapers and groceries. At the suggestion of a friend, Rymkus attended Tilden Tech, now known as Tilden High School, and began to display talent as a lineman on the school's football team. He blocked a kick and scored a touchdown in a game at Chicago's Soldier Field in 1936 against rival Austin High, a play he later said was the most memorable of his high school career. Rymkus won seven letters at Tilden playing on the football, track and wrestling teams. As a senior, he defeated Rudy Mucha to win the Chicago prep-school wrestling title.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem with}} food waste {{has become more}} and more evident during recent years and a {{reduction}} of the waste would be one important step towards a more sustainable society. The purpose of this comparative study is to examine how some Swedish <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> handle their food waste and compare if there are any differences between the three main actors on <b>the</b> Swedish <b>grocery</b> <b>store</b> market; Coop, ICA, and Hemköp. The study will examine how <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> handle their food waste today, what they do to reduce it and if anything hinders them from taking better care of the waste. Theoretical results indicate an improved infrastructure at <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> can reduce <b>the</b> waste, which involves resources, activities and partners. It also shows an efficient supply chain is important and to reach more efficiency must the chain actors be able to handle uncertainties, collaborate and share information. But to know {{what needs to be done}} is one thing, to make it happen is another and to change old habits and routines can be difficult. Empirical findings demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> are very much dependant on their customers’ behaviours and attitudes as well as the efficiency of the whole food supply chain when it comes to food waste reduction.

5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store</b> and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to clarify whether there was a {{difference}} between two inspection methods regarding which the most effective one is considering to which extent businesses accept the requirements from the Environmental and Health Protection Unit (EHPU).

Results showed that there was no difference between the two studied methods in terms of to which extent the operators undertook the requirements. However the pedicure clinics were more satisfied with EHP’s treatment and considered that the EHPU affected their environmental behavior positively which the owners of <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> didn’t thought.
