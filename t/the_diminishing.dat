5|$|The Siege of Mantua (1799) was {{a four-month}} {{effort by the}} Austrian army to regain a {{presence}} in northern Italy after being excluded from that region by Napoleon Bonaparte through the successful French Siege of Mantua in 1797. In April 1799, the Austrians placed a military blockade around Mantua {{as part of the}} War of the Second Coalition with the intent of withering the French by attrition. While <b>the</b> <b>diminishing</b> food supplies and losses weakened the French army, the Austrians received reinforcements and attacked on 4 July 1799. By the end of the month, the French agreed to surrender.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>diminishing</b> {{number of}} troops {{available}} to Vang Pao demanded their replacement by growing numbers of Thai volunteers (Project Unity), who increasingly took over the ground war in the north. By the end of 1971, the entire 55-man battalion of Thais were in action, whose total numbers were 6,000–8,000 men. During the following year, those numbers had ballooned to 17,800. The total force eventually deployed was three artillery and 27 infantry battalions.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{withdrawal}} of U.S. forces under the policy of Vietnamization, from 1 November 1968 until 23 February 1973, Barrel Roll competed for a share of diminishing U.S tactical air assets. In December 1968, approximately 700 American strike aircraft had been available in-theater. By the spring of 1972, that number had fallen to 313. On 18 July, the Nakhon Phanom-based 22nd Special Operations Squadron was disbanded. Its sister squadron, the 602nd Special Operations Squadron, closed out on 20 December, leaving only the 1st Special Operations Squadron at Nakhon Phanom to support Royal Laotian ground operations. The RLAF attempted {{to make up for}} <b>the</b> <b>diminishing</b> number of American sorties. During 1968 the Laotians flew 10,000 strike sorties. During 1970 through 1972 that number increased to over 30,000 in each year.|$|E
5|$|Iron mining {{occurred}} in several locations, including the main English centre in the Forest of Dean, {{as well as}} in Durham and the Weald. Some iron to meet English demand was also imported from the continent, especially by the late 13th century. By the end of the 12th century, the older method of acquiring iron ore through strip mining was being supplemented by more advanced techniques, including tunnels, trenches and bell-pits. Iron ore was usually locally processed at a bloomery, and by the 14th century the first water-powered iron forge in England was built at Chingley. As a result of <b>the</b> <b>diminishing</b> woodlands and consequent increases in the cost of both wood and charcoal, demand for coal increased in the 12th century and it began to be commercially produced from bell-pits and strip mining.|$|E
5|$|People {{have lived}} in the Everglades region for {{thousands}} of years. Within the past 100years however, they have changed the natural landscape dramatically. Settlement of urban areas in South Florida was facilitated by large drainage projects intended to create more land. The drainage was often implemented without a full understanding of the intricacies of ecosystems and shaping processes of the Everglades. The South Florida metropolitan area grew exponentially, causing problems in ecosystems throughout the Everglades. By the 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>diminishing</b> quality of life in many of these urban areas was linked to the degraded local environment. The State of Florida and the U.S. government devised and passed a plan in 2000 to restore as much of the Everglades to pre-drainage conditions as possible. It is the costliest and most comprehensive environmental restoration project in history.|$|E

5|$|Prince of Wales and Repulse {{were the}} first capital ships to be sunk solely by naval air power on the open sea (albeit by {{land-based}} rather than carrier-based aircraft), a harbinger of <b>the</b> <b>diminishing</b> role this class of ships was to play in naval warfare thereafter. It is often pointed out, however, that contributing factors to the sinking of Prince of Wales were her surface-scanning radars being inoperable, depriving Force Z {{of one of its}} most potent early-warning devices and the critical early damage she sustained from the first torpedo. Another factor which led to Prince of Waless demise was the loss of dynamos, depriving Prince of Wales of many of her electric pumps. Further electrical failures left parts of the ship in total darkness, and added to the difficulties of her damage repair parties as they attempted to counter the flooding.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{reaching}} its peak intensity, Debby encountered {{an area of}} dry air, and subsequently weakened. The low level circulation detached itself from <b>the</b> <b>diminishing</b> convection while {{the system as a}} whole continued west-northwestward. Convection redeveloped over a portion of the center, while banding features redeveloped as well. Organization continued, and Debby again reached its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) on August 24. Southerly wind shear displaced the convection {{to the north of the}} center, and Debby weakened to a minimal tropical storm on August 25. The center of the storm became asymmetric and elongated, and on August 26 Debby weakened to a tropical depression. Convection remained minimal and it quickly degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure. The low turned to the north and north-northeast ahead of an approaching trough, and on August 28 the low dissipated.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand forest {{relies heavily}} on frugivorous birds for seed dispersal: about 70% of the woody plants have fruits that are {{probably}} dispersed by birds, which included the huia. The range of fruits eaten by the huia is difficult to establish: hinau (Elaeocarpus dentatus), pigeonwood (Hedycarya arborea) and various species of Coprosma are recorded by Buller, and they were also recorded as eating the fruits of kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides). The extinction of the huia and other frugivorous New Zealand bird species including the moa and piopio, and <b>the</b> <b>diminishing</b> range of many others, including the kiwi, weka, and kōkako, has left few effective seed dispersers in the New Zealand forest. For plants with fruit greater than 1cm in diameter, kereru are the sole remaining dispersers in the ecosystem, and they are rare or extinct in some areas. This depletion of avifauna in the forest ecosystem may be having major impacts on processes such as forest regeneration and seed dispersal.|$|E

50|$|In any tuning system, the {{deviation}} of an octave from three major thirds, however large that is, is typically {{referred to as}} a <b>diminished</b> second. <b>The</b> <b>diminished</b> second is an interval between pairs of enharmonically equivalent notes; for instance the interval between E and F. As mentioned above, the term diesis most commonly refers to <b>the</b> <b>diminished</b> second in quarter-comma meantone temperament. Less frequently and less strictly, the same term is also used to refer to a diminished second of any size. In third-comma meantone, <b>the</b> <b>diminished</b> second is typically denoted as a greater diesis (see below).|$|R

5|$|There Daniel takes part in {{a number}} of experiments, {{including}} the exploration of <b>the</b> <b>diminishing</b> effects of gravity with changes in elevation, the transfusion of blood between dogs and Wilkins' attempts to create a philosophical language. Daniel soon becomes disgusted with some of the practices of the older natural philosophers (which include vivisection of animals) and visits Newton during his experiments with color and white light. They attempt to return to Cambridge, but again plague expels the students. Daniel returns to his father; however, his arrival on the outskirts of London coincides with {{the second day of the}} Fire of London. Drake, taken by religious fervour, dies atop his house as the King blows it up to create a fire break to prevent further spread of the fire. Soon after Drake's death, Newton and Daniel then return to Cambridge and begin lecturing.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} moved over the East China Sea on September1, Agnes began to {{interact}} with a mid-latitude trough situated south of South Korea and began a prolonged extratropical transition. Increasing wind shear exposed {{the center of the}} typhoon and displaced convection to the north and east. Subsequent slowing of the cyclone's forward speed as it turned northward resulted in an extended period of heavy rain for much of South Korea. The JTWC estimated Agnes to have become predominantly extratropical by the end of September1, coinciding with the system weakening below typhoon intensity. The JMA, however, maintained the storm as a tropical system as it began moving northwest. <b>The</b> <b>diminishing</b> cyclone moved over the Korea Strait on September3 and completed its extratropical transition that afternoon. Accelerating over the Sea of Japan, the remnant storm deepened slightly before striking the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido on September4 with an estimated pressure of 976mbar (hPa; 28.82inHg). After moving over the Sea of Okhotsk, Agnes impacted the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia on September5. The system then moved over the open waters of the North Pacific and was last noted near the International Dateline on September6.|$|E
5|$|While {{continuing}} {{generally to}} the west, {{the eye of}} Pongsona gradually became better organized. A baroclinic cyclone east of Japan weakened the ridge, which caused the typhoon to turn more to the northwest. By late on December 7, Pongsona developed a well-defined 55km (35mi) wide eye as it approached Guam. After the typhoon underwent rapid deepening, the JTWC estimated that Pongsona reached peak winds of 240km/h (150mph 1-min sustained), making it a supertyphoon. At 0500UTC on December 8, the eyewall made landfall on Guam, and two hours later the northern portion of the eyewall crossed over nearby Rota. Around that time, the JMA estimated Pongsona attained a peak intensity of 175km/h (110mph 10-min winds) just {{to the north of}} Guam. The typhoon turned to the north-northwest through a weakness in the subtropical ridge a short distance west of the Northern Mariana Islands. On December 9, convection began to weaken as Pongsona began interacting with a mid-latitude system to its north. Dry air became entrained in the southwestern portion of the circulation, and the circulation became exposed from <b>the</b> <b>diminishing</b> convection. As a result, both the JTWC and the JMA declared Pongsona as an extratropical cyclone on December 11 about 1400km (865mi) northwest of Wake Island.|$|E

5|$|Located {{in an area}} of {{warm water}} {{temperatures}} and light wind shear, Hurricane Paul continued to intensify and organize; its well-defined eye was surrounded by a ring of deep convection while outflow remained strong to the north and south. On October23, while located 465miles (750km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Paul reached its peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h), a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A large trough located off the west coast of California turned the hurricane to the north-northwest, and later to the north. The combination of increasing shear and dry air quickly weakened Paul to a tropical storm on October24 as its low-level circulation became detached from <b>the</b> <b>diminishing</b> convection. The storm then turned to the northeast after passing near Socorro Island. Despite increasing wind shear of over 50mph (80km/h), Paul remained a tropical storm while its circulation remained on the southwest side of its developing deep convection. Early on October25, the storm passed about 100miles (160km) south of the southern tip of Baja California. The circulation briefly became involved with the deep convection as it accelerated northeastward, though as it approached the coast of Sinaloa, the center again decoupled from the upper level circulation. Later that day, Paul weakened to a tropical depression a short distance off the coast of Mexico, and turned to the north. Early the next day, the depression, devoid of any deep convection, made landfall near Isla Altamura in northwestern Sinaloa. Hours later, the National Hurricane Center issued the last advisory on the dissipating tropical depression.|$|E
