5000|$|Simple {{interactive}} object extraction (SIOX) is an algorithm for extracting foreground {{objects from}} color images and videos {{with very little}} user interaction. It has been implemented as [...] "foreground selection" [...] tool in the GIMP (since version 2.3.3), {{as part of the}} <b>tracer</b> <b>tool</b> in Inkscape (since 0.44pre3), and as function in ImageJ and Fiji (plug-in). Experimental implementations were also reported for Blender and Krita. Although the algorithm was originally designed for videos, virtually all implementations use SIOX primarily for still image segmentation. In fact, it is often said to be the current de facto standard for this task in the open-source world. Initially, a free hand selection tool is used to specify the region of interest. It must contain all foreground objects to extract and as few background as possible. The pixels outside the region of interest form the sure background while the inner region define a superset of the foreground, i.e. the unknown region. A so-called foreground brush is then used to mark representative foreground regions. The algorithm outputs a selection mask. The selection can be refined by either adding further foreground markings or by adding background markings using the background brush.|$|E

Along with these data reporting norms, we discuss additional metadata that will improve understanding of the data and also enhance the ability to re-interpret and assess them in the context of other studies. We posit that these recommendations will provide a foundation for increasing the longevity and usefulness of measurements in the discipline of U-series geochronology...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWith {{the advent}} of shale oil and shale gas {{development}} facilitated by hydraulic fracturing {{it has become increasingly}} important to develop <b>tracer</b> <b>tools</b> to scientifically determine potential impacts of stray gases, formation fluids, or fracturing chemicals on shallow aquifers. Based on a multi-year monitoring program conducted in Alberta (Canada), we demonstrate that a multi-isotope approach (δ 2 HH 2 O; δ 18 OH 2 O; δ 13 CCH 4; δ 2 HCH 4; δ 13 CC 2 H 6) in concert with chemical analyses is highly capable of identifying potential contamination of shallow aquifers with stray gases or saline fluids from intermediate or production zones, provided that sufficient baseline data have been collected. At baseline conditions, we found that methane in shallow groundwater in southern Alberta is ubiquitous and predominantly of biogenic origin. Novel approaches of in-situ concentration and isotope measurements for methane during drilling of a 530 m deep well yielded a mud-gas profile characterizing natural gas occurrences in the intermediate zone. The assembled data set provides evidence that potential stray gas contamination by isotopically distinct deeper thermogenic gases from the intermediate or from production zones can be effectively detected by suitable monitoring programs...|$|R

40|$|We use the UPPAAL model checker for Timed Automata {{to verify}} the Timing-Sync time-synchronization {{protocol}} for sensor networks (TPSN). The TPSN protocol seeks to provide network-wide synchronization of the distributed clocks in a sensor network. Clock-synchronization algorithms for sensor networks such as TPSN {{must be able to}} perform arithmetic on clock values to calculate clock drift and network propagation delays. They must be able to read the value of a local clock and assign it to another local clock. Such operations are not directly supported by the theory of Timed Automata. To overcome this formal-modeling obstacle, we augment the UPPAAL specification language with the integer clock derived type. Integer clocks, which are essentially integer variables that are periodically incremented by a global pulse generator, greatly facilitate the encoding of the operations required to synchronize clocks as in the TPSN protocol. With this integer-clock-based model of TPSN in hand, we use UPPAAL to verify that the protocol achieves network-wide time synchronization and is devoid of deadlock. We also use the UPPAAL <b>Tracer</b> <b>tool</b> to illustrate how integer clocks can be used to capture clock drift and resynchronization during protocol executio...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 A goal of reusing {{source code}} is to lower {{development}} cost; however, reuse techniques usually require additional costs in creating generic source code and retrieving the appropriate source code from a code repository.

40|$|International audienceThis {{review of}} applied geochemical methods for {{monitoring}} CO 2 leakage focuses on shallow freshwater aquifers overlying CO 2 storage areas. Geochemical <b>tracer</b> <b>tools</b> form {{a set of}} geochemical techniques, {{each of which is}} examined in this review and classified according to its sensitivity in CO 2 detection. The pur- pose of any monitoring programme {{is to be able to}} provide sufficient information to enable site remedi- ation in the case of unforeseen events and also to enable a satisfactory site closure strategy. Therefore, CO 2 monitoring tools must be able to detect a precursor signal or an early warning signal of leakage asso- ciated with potentially minute geochemical modifications (i. e. associated with small amounts of CO 2). We have classified the monitoring/tracing tools into two groups: (A) direct indicators of the CO 2 itself, and (B) indirect indicators (i. e. reaction products) of the presence of CO 2 that take into account displace- ment of the chemical equilibria under the conditions imposed by CO 2 dissolution. Included in these tools are isotopic monitoring tools that are very sensitive to physico-chemical changes and can therefore pro- vide early CO 2 detection. These tools include carbon and oxygen isotope systematics that are convention- ally used with respect to CO 2 in the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) context. Finally, the review offers new perspectives on sensitive indirect detection methods using isotopes that are ‘non-traditional’ in the sense that they have not yet been applied to the field of CO 2 geological storage. The complementarity of these geochemical methods provides a powerful monitoring strategy...|$|R

Using a combination of retrograde <b>tracers,</b> optogenetic <b>tools,</b> and electrophysiological recordings, we show that VTA GABAergic axons make synaptic contacts in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, where we can elicit small postsynaptic currents. Surprisingly, the currents displayed a partial sensitivity to both bicuculline and NBQX, suggesting that these mesohippocampal neurons corelease both GABA and glutamate. Finally, we show that this projection is functional in vivo and its stimulation reduces granule cell-firing rates under anesthesia. Altogether, the present results describe a novel connection between GABA and glutamate coreleasing of cells of the VTA and the dentate gyrus.

40|$|Bacteriophages are {{increasingly}} used as tracers for quantitative analysis in both hydrology and hydrogeology. The biological particles are neither toxic nor pathogenic for other living organisms as they penetrate only a specific bacterial host. They have many advantages over classical fluorescent tracers and offer the additional possibility of multi-point injection for tracer tests. Several {{years of research}} make them suitable for quantitative transport analysis and flow boundary delineation in both surface and ground waters, including karst, fractured and porous media aquifers. This article presents the effective application of bacteriophages based on their use in differing Swiss hydrological environments and compares their behaviour to conventional coloured dye or salt-type tracers. In surface water and karst aquifers, bacteriophages travel {{at about the same}} speed as the typically referenced fluorescent tracers (uranine, sulphurhodamine G extra). In aquifers of interstitial porosity, however, they appear to migrate more rapidly than fluorescent tracers, albeit with a significant reduction in their numbers within the porous media. This faster travel time implies that a modified rationale is needed for defining some gro und water protection area boundaries. Further developments of other bacteriophages and their documentation as tracer methods should result in an accurate and efficient <b>tracer</b> <b>tool</b> that will be a proven alternative to conventional fluorescent dyes...|$|E

To enhance the capabilities of cognitive radio nodes, exploiting the spatial resource in addition to frequency and time re-sources seems reasonable. This thesis investigates the possibility of exploiting the spatial resources during sensing and transmission using sector antennas which is also termed as directional spectrum sensing and transmission. The measured radiation patterns from fabricated antenna and radiation patterns obtained from analytical expressions representing circular array of dipole are used for performance analysis. A ray <b>tracer</b> <b>tool</b> is used for modelling the urban environment as well as for wave propagation simulation. The power angular profiles obtained at different locations are further processed in MATLAB using measured and analytical radiation patterns to evaluate the performance in terms of spatial opportunity and detection of weak primary signals. The results show that exploiting the spatial dimension in spectrum sensing using sector antennas increase the opportunities for secondary communication and also improves the detection of primary signals as compared with an omni-directional antenna. Additionally, directional sensing and trans-mission are studied together using analytical radiation patterns. The results show that the service probability as well as range of communica-tion increases with an increase in number of sectors but saturation is achieved when nine sectors are used, indicating that six sectors antenna is the optimum choice for exploring the spatial resource in cognitive radio in a typical multipath urban environment...|$|E

The purpose of the experiments was to examine whether the conductivity of water flowing through a soluble tracer corresponds to the conductivity of the saturated solution. The results indicate that the conductivity of water flowing through halite is approximately equal to the saturated solution. Unlike halite, gypsum was found to be unsuitable because after drying, gypsum milled to analytical fineness becomes solid mass which does not dissolve any more...|$|R

40|$|A central {{feature of}} {{theories}} of spatial navigation involves {{the representation of}} spatial relationships between objects in complex environments. The parietal cortex has long {{been linked to the}} processing of spatial visual information and recent evidence from single unit recording in rodents suggests a role for this region in encoding egocentric and world-centered frames. The rat parietal cortex can be subdivided into up to four distinct rostral-caudal and medial-lateral regions, which includes a zone previously characterized as secondary visual cortex. At present, very little is known regarding the relative connectivity of these parietal subdivisions. Thus, we set out to map the connectivity of the entire anterior-posterior and medial-lateral span of this region. To do this we used anterograde and retrograde tracers in conjunction with open source neuronal segmentation and <b>tracer</b> detection <b>tools</b> to generate whole brain connectivity maps of parietal inputs and outputs. Our present results show that inputs to the parietal cortex varied significantly along the medial-lateral, but not the rostral-caudal axis. Specifically, retrosplenial connectivity is greater medially, but connectivity with visual cortex, though generally sparse, is more significant laterally. Finally, based on connection density, the connectivity between parietal cortex and hippocampus is indirect and likely achieved largely via dysgranular retrosplenial cortex. Thus, similar to primates, the parietal cortex of rats exhibits a difference in connectivity along the medial-lateral axis, which may represent functionally distinct areas...|$|R

40|$|A {{recent report}} found that power and heat {{produced}} from enhanced (or engineered) geothermal systems (EGSs) could {{have a major impact}} on the U. S energy production capability while having a minimal impact on the environment. EGS resources differ from high-grade hydrothermal resources in that they lack sufficient temperature distribution, permeability/porosity, fluid saturation, or recharge of reservoir fluids. Therefore, quantitative characterization of temperature distributions and the surface area available for heat transfer in EGS is necessary for the design and commercial development of the geothermal energy of a potential EGS site. The goal of this project is to provide integrated tracer and <b>tracer</b> interpretation <b>tools</b> to facilitate this characterization. This project was initially focused on tracer development with the application of perfluorinated tracer (PFT) compounds, non-reactive tracers used in numerous applications from atmospheric transport to underground leak detection, to geothermal systems, and evaluation of encapsulated PFTs that would release tracers at targeted reservoir temperatures. After the 2011 midyear review and subsequent discussions with the U. S. Department of Energy Geothermal Technology Program (GTP), emphasis was shifted to interpretive tool development, testing, and validation. Subsurface modeling capabilities are an important component of this project for both the design of suitable tracers and the interpretation of data from in situ tracer tests, be they single- or multi-well tests. The purpose of this report is to describe the results of the tracer and model development for simulating and conducting tracer tests for characterizing EGS parameters...|$|R

Provided the broad spectrum of putative applications of TSPO ligands, further studies are eagerly awaited. With further development of potential tracers by better understanding of the protean nature of the receptor in healthy and diseased brain, PET imaging of the TSPO could offer a non-invasive modality for early diagnosis and theranostics of CNS diseases in ways beyond the scope of conventional imaging techniques.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe use of {{artificial}} <b>tracers</b> as a <b>tool</b> for matrix and fracture (-network) characterization is examined {{in conjunction with}} a variety of geothermal-related fracturing operations in Germany, either chemical-based or plain-hydraulic, with or without proppants, both with short-term tracings (during and immediately after fracturing) and for long-term production monitoring, in sedimentary and crystalline formations in the N-German Basin, at the sites Horstberg and Groß Schönebeck. As an outcome of tracer test analysis for the latter site, a tool for the tracer-based quantification of individual frac discharge in single-well multiple-frac backflow and production can be derived, whose major advantage consists in using only stable conservative tracers, and in its independence from hydrogeological a priori knowledge. This tool can also be applied in unconventional hydrocarbon reservoir development and operation, where assessing the uniformity of multiple inflow zones is crucial to reservoir economics; complimentary use of reactive alongside with conservative tracers, with dual partitioning behavior for source and daughter species, enables to further determine the relevant hydrogeologic parameters of producing fracs or matrix ‘damage’ zones, independently of their productivity...|$|R
40|$|Ongoing Phase 2 - 3 work {{comprises}} the final development and field-testing of two complementary real-time reservoir technologies; a stimulation process and a tracer fracturing diagnostic system. Initial DE-FC 26 - 99 FT 40129 project work included research, development, {{and testing of}} the patented gamma tracer fracturing diagnostic system. This process was field-proven to be technically useful in providing tracer measurement of fracture height while fracturing; however, technical licensing restrictions blocked Realtimezone from fully field-testing this real-time gamma diagnostic system, as originally planned. Said restrictions were encountered during Phase 2 field test work as result of licensing limitations and potential conflicts between service companies participating in project work, as related to their gamma <b>tracer</b> logging <b>tool</b> technology. Phase 3 work principally demonstrated field-testing of Realtimezone (RTZ) and NETL's Downhole-mixed Reservoir Stimulation process. Early on, the simplicity of and success of downhole-mixing was evident from well tests, which were made commercially productive. A downhole-mixed acid stimulation process was tested successfully and is currently commercially used in Canada. The fourth well test was aborted due to well bore conditions, and an alternate test project is scheduled April, 2004. Realtimezone continues to effectuate ongoing patent protection in the United States and foreign markets. In 2002, Realtimezone and the NETL licensed their United States patent to Halliburton Energy Services (HES). Additional licensing arrangements with other industry companies are anticipated in 2004 - 2005. Ongoing Phase 2 and Phase 3 field-testing continues to confirm applications of both real-time technologies. Technical data transfer to industry is ongoing via Internet tech-transfer and various industry presentations and publications including Society of Petroleum Engineers.

Recent studies focus on from where arc magmas are generated, how subduction components (fluids or melts) are fluxed into {{the source of the}} magmas, and whether or how the subduction components affect partial melting processes beneath volcanic arcs at convergent boundaries. ^ At 39. 5 °S in the Central Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andes, Volcano Villarrica is surrounded by a suite of Small Eruptive Centers (SEC). The SECs are located mostly to the east and northeast of the stratovolcano and aligned along the Liquine-Ofqui Fault Zone, the major fracture system in this area. Former studies observed the geochemical patterns of the SECs differ distinctively from those of V. Villarrica and suggested there may be a relationship between the compositions of the volcanic units and their edifice sizes. This work is a comprehensive geochemical study on the SECs near V. Villarrica, using a variety of geochemical <b>tracers</b> and <b>tools</b> including major, trace and REE elements, Li-Be-B elements, Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes and short-lived isotopes such as U-series and 10 Be. In this work, systematic differences between the elemental and isotopic compositions of the SECs and those of V.

Detailed modeling calculations in this work reconstruct chemical compositions of the primary magmas, source compositions, compositions and percentages of different subduction endmembers mixed into the source, degrees of partial melting and different time scales of the SECs and V.

We also discuss the possibility to use dust <b>tracers</b> as diagnostic <b>tools.</b> We then survey our current understanding of the microscopic, intrinsic properties of dust in different environments, derived from different observables: emission, extinction, polarization, depletions, over the whole electromagnetic spectrum. Finally, we summarize the clues of grain evolution, evidenced either on local scales or over cosmic time. We put in perspective the different evolution scenarios. We attempt a comprehensive presentation of the main observational constraints, analysis methods and modelling frameworks of the distinct processes. We do not cover the dust properties of the Milky Way and distant galaxies, nor circumstellar or active galactic nucleus torus dust.

40|$|Inheritance in ODS style {{templates}} {{has been}} simplified in Version 9. 2 SAS. Now you don’t need a FROM clause in a CLASS statement {{when you work}} with defined lineages in the Styles. Default template. However, lineages as well as attributes can be changed when new style templates are created in ODS. This means that you need an ODS lineage tracer that links inheritance from Base. Template. Style to associated attribute settings in the Styles. Default template. Only by viewing attribute settings at their assigned locations in a lineage, {{is it possible to}} know for certain when STYLE … FROM can safely be discarded in favor of the CLASS statement. This paper shows by example how to use the lineage <b>tracer</b> plus additional <b>tools</b> to develop new styles 1 from the Styles. Default template. By studying the examples presented, you will be able stretch ODS inheritance to get the output you want. INHERITANCE, LINEAGE AND FAMILY TREES Since inheritance plays a pivotal role in ODS style definitions, terms need to be defined from the outset. The added underlined text in the following definitions taken from The Concise Oxford Dictionary [2] shows that inheritance, lineage, and family tree are closely related: inheritance n. 1 a thing that is inherited. 2 the act of inheriting...|$|R
