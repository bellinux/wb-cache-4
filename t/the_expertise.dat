5|$|In 1997, the Russian {{government}} announced {{that all of}} its remaining smallpox samples would be moved to the Vector Institute in Koltsovo.

Specific allegations made against Iraq in this respect, however, proved to be mistaken.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1964, {{however, the}} Kingston Trio's {{dominance}} in record sales and concert bookings began to wane, due partly to imitators in the pop-folk world {{and also to}} the rise of other commercial folk groups like Peter, Paul and Mary. The British Invasion spearheaded by The Beatles, who were signed by EMI/Capitol just as the Trio's seven-year contract was running out, depressed sales of acoustic folk albums significantly, and Capitol did not make a serious effort to re-sign the group. Werber secured a generous signing bonus from Decca Records, and the last four albums of the Kingston Trio's first decade were released by that label. Without the production facilities of Capitol, however, and <b>the</b> <b>expertise</b> of Voyle Gilmore and engineer Pete Abbott, the Decca releases lacked the aural brilliance of the Capitol albums, and none of the four sold especially well.|$|E
5|$|By late 1944, rocket {{development}} and testing work began to taper off, and production models started {{to reach the}} Navy and USAAF in quantity. The director of the OSRD, Vannevar Bush saw an opportunity {{to use some of}} <b>the</b> <b>expertise</b> at Caltech on another secret wartime project he was involved with, the Manhattan Project. Bush arranged for Charles C. Lauritsen, the head of the rocket team at Caltech, to visit the Los Alamos Laboratory, and meet with the project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the laboratory director, Robert Oppenheimer, and senior scientists at the Los Alamos laboratory. Oppenheimer and Lauritsen knew each other well, as Oppenheimer had worked at Caltech before the war. In addition to its scientists, Caltech also possessed an experienced procurement team, headed by Trevor Gardner. This group worked closely with its counterpart at Los Alamos, which was headed by Lieutenant Colonel Robert W. Lockridge.|$|E

In her last words, Connie admits that she set up Lucas in Moscow eight years ago, which resulted in his imprisonment. Lucas and Ros then run to safety as the bomb detonates, killing Connie. With disaster averted, Lucas calls Harry, but receives no answer. In the end, it is revealed Sarkisiian has him locked up in the boot of his car.|$|E
5|$|The DDL {{project was}} {{reviewed}} {{again when the}} Liberal Fraser Government came into office in late 1975. The review panel unanimously advised the new Minister for Defence James Killen that the DDL project was no longer viable as {{the total cost of}} the ships would be about $130 million higher than the Oliver Hazard Perry project, and it would take three years longer for the DDLs to be completed. Killen accepted this advice, and a firm order for two Oliver Hazard Perry frigates was placed in February 1976. A third ship was ordered in late 1977. Six of these frigates, which were designated the , were eventually ordered, and the final two were built in Australia at Williamstown. <b>The</b> <b>expertise</b> of the DDL project office and the preparations which had been undertaken to manage the process of ordering and building the ships contributed to the Navy's ability to rapidly evaluate alternative designs and oversee their entry into service once an order was placed.|$|E
5|$|Currently, the {{conservation}} department serves {{the needs of}} the museum through <b>the</b> <b>expertise</b> of specialists in paintings, textiles, works on paper, frames, and objects conservation. The department has grown in both size and staff throughout the years, with the most recent expansion occurring in 2007. As of 2007, the IMA owned one of the few computer-based X-ray units in the United States, continuing a trend in X-ray technology that the department began in the 1970s. In 1980, the department helped organize and establish the Midwest Regional Conservation Guild, which includes conservators and conservation scientists from Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan. In the mid-1980s, the department received attention when head conservator Martin Radecki assisted local authorities in uncovering over two dozen forged T.C. Steele and William Forsythe paintings worth more than $200,000. The high-profile forgery case led Radecki to organize an exhibit in 1989, Is it Genuine? Steele, Forsythe and Forgery in Indiana. The exhibit highlighted conservation techniques and examined how forgeries can be discovered. Another public presentation of conservation took place in 2007 with Sebastiano Mainardi: The Science of Art, a Star Studio exhibit that allowed visitors to watch conservators as they worked on the 16th-century altarpiece. The IMA's Star Studio is an interactive gallery that enables visitors to learn, through the process of art-making and observation, about the museum's collections.|$|E

5|$|In {{its first}} year, the Referendum Party had little {{established}} organisation and largely remained a concept with limited concrete presence. Goldsmith's finances had allowed its appearance {{to be accompanied}} with mass publicity but it lacked the standard machinery of a political party, such as a mass membership or politically experienced personnel. To counter this problem, Goldsmith sought to create a sophisticated administrative centre and to secure <b>the</b> <b>expertise</b> {{to carry out a}} political campaign, establishing his headquarters in London. By October 1995, the party had established a hierarchical structure consisting of three tiers: the centre, region and constituency. Operating the centre was Goldsmith and a cabinet whose membership included Lord McAlpine, who was a former treasurer of the Conservative Party, and two former members of the Conservative Central Office staff. The centre had around 50 staff, who relayed Goldsmith's instructions through to the ten regional co-ordinators, who in turn transmitted them to the prospective candidates in the constituencies. This top-down and undemocratic structure concentrated decision making with Goldsmith and the centre and provided little autonomy for the regions and constituencies, although this was deemed necessary to ensure efficiency in its campaign.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} <b>the</b> role of <b>{{expertise}}</b> (technē) in Plato’s Statesman. We argue that expertise {{is one of}} the central notions in the dialogue, which pervades the conception of political action and human condition in general. In the Statesman, humans are understood as technological animals whose being is in the constant state of conflict. However, <b>the</b> <b>expertises</b> do not overcome the political conflict but stimulate it even more by competing for political power. One of the activities of statesmanship is to manage and control <b>the</b> conflict of <b>expertises</b> by ordering their functions, using them for communal good and regulating them by means of disciplinary expertises. In such a way, statesmanship reveals as an <b>expertise</b> itself. <b>The</b> foundation for statesman’s expertise is his theoretical knowledge, which gives the understanding about the evolvement of <b>the</b> conflict of <b>expertises</b> and about <b>the</b> solutions required for political action...|$|R
