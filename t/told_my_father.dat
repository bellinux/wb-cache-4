500|$|The elder Lajoie, {{who worked}} as a {{teamster}} and laborer, died not long into the younger Lajoie's childhood, which forced him and his siblings to work to support the family. Lajoie dropped out of school to work in a textile mill. He also began playing semi-professional baseball for the local Woonsocket team under the alias [...] "Sandy", because his parents did not approve of their son playing baseball. He earned money as a taxi driver with a horse and buggy and locally was called [...] "Slugging Cabby." [...] "When I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> I had decided to take the job he was very angry. He shouted that ball players were bums and that nobody respected them, but I was determined {{to give it a try}} at least one season", Lajoie later said. He also received the nickname [...] "Larry" [...] from a teammate who had trouble pronouncing Lajoie. Lajoie admired baseball players such as King Kelly and Charles Radbourn.|$|E

6000|$|She looked {{steadily}} at him. [...] "Mr. Briggs <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> that {{he would}} pay you ten dollars {{for the privilege of}} staying here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Truly {{there is}} but one God,' said Sheikh Hassan, 'and Mahomet is his Prophet. He <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>fathers</b> to pray to Allah, and to Allah I pray.' ...|$|R
6000|$|DORA. [...] I <b>told</b> you-- <b>My</b> <b>father.</b> Well, indeed, {{a friend}} just now, One {{that has been}} much wrong'd, whose griefs are mine, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, not long. We {{are going}} down to the country almost immediately. I <b>told</b> you <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and Mr. Mortimer had taken a house there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} heard a word from Colonel Ray," [...] she said. [...] "It terrifies {{me to think that}} he may have <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> about Blenavon." ...|$|E
6000|$|But so soon as {{the servant}} was gone, he broke forth again at once. “Who <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father?</b> Who dared to tell him? Could it have been you?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not going}} to pay Mr. Axworthy's reckoning," [...] said Norman, rather angrily. [...] "You will never be better till you have <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> the whole." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said he, [...] "I <b>told</b> both <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and <b>my</b> mother. What {{she says}} to you, you must hear, and bear it quietly for my sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Impossible! You {{forget what}} I have just <b>told</b> you. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> was {{suffering}} {{at that time}} under the illness which afterward caused his death. He was quite unfit to interfere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{first words}} to me--they were of my mother. None else {{but the man}} who loved her as she has <b>told</b> me <b>my</b> <b>father</b> did would have thought first of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|But so soon as {{the servant}} was gone, he broke forth again at once. [...] "Who <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father?</b> Who dared to tell him? Could it have been you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> about him,--how you rescued him, and how {{you went}} to see him in the hospital, and what a good man he is, and how poor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just as I thought," [...] {{continued}} Shep. [...] "And {{just what}} I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> He {{wants us to}} go out, you know," [...] and Shep's eyes began to twinkle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must speak}} of them. In former days, I {{think you were}} <b>told</b> that <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> will {{provided}} for my mother and for me. You {{know that we have}} enough to live on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Probably I <b>told</b> you <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{lived at}} Syracuse. I've been in New York ever since I {{came home from}} Paris," [...] said Beaton, with the {{confusion}} {{of a man who}} feels himself played upon by a woman.|$|R
60|$|Then we marched {{from the}} kraal Umgugundhlovu, and when next I saw that kraal {{it was to}} burn all of it which Dingaan had left unburnt, and when next I saw Dingaan--ah! {{that is to be}} <b>told</b> of, <b>my</b> <b>father.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "So he <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> also," [...] added Mary Warren, [...] "who {{has often}} {{spoken to him}} of death, and has hoped to open {{his eyes to the}} truths of the gospel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so, Sir Ralph. I {{have tried}} my best, {{and he has}} been good enough to commend me warmly, and even <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> that I was the aptest pupil that he had." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not," [...] said Richard. [...] "You and I made a mistake, but it {{does not}} follow that Tom would have kept out of this scrape, if we had <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> our notion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This, Son. With {{the black}} bow that you have," [...] and {{she pointed to}} the case that leaned against the table, [...] "it has come down in my family for many generations. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> me that it was the sword of one Thorgrimmer, his ancestor, a Norseman, a Viking he called him, who came with those who took England before the Norman time; which I can well believe since <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> name, like mine, till I married, was Grimmer. This sword, also, has a name and it is Wave-Flame. With it, the tale tells, Thorgrimmer did great deeds, slaying many after their heathen fashion in his battles by land and sea. For he was a wanderer, and it is said of him that once he sailed to a new land far across the ocean, and won home again after many strange adventures, to die at last here in England in some fray. That is all I know, save that a learned man from the north once <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> father that the writing on the sword means:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No; it was Aynsley Clay who <b>told</b> me. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> {{certainly}} {{asked one}} of the Empress mates what had become of you, but learned only that you had left the ship. You must remember Aynsley, the yachtsman you met on the island.” ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was more}} than one pale face among the women and younger {{children}} when I <b>told</b> of <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> death, and I dare say but few would have remained to build homes nearabout the Ohio River if it had been possible for them {{to get back to the}} settlement they had just left.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My eldest brother {{came across}} a Greek philosopher, and <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>Father</b> that he {{intended}} to settle down on the estate as a farmer and a philosopher. You see,'--the young man's eyes twinkled--'his philosopher was a long-haired one!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, the {{landslide}} was {{too heavy}} and too far-reaching. The old miners <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{it was the biggest}} landslide known in Montana. One prospector said he thought the mine must now be a hundred feet or more underground." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was the man. The {{son of the}} vicar. The vicar {{told the}} curate, who told our curate, who told our vicar, who <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> who sent me off here to get a Balliol too. Do you know Barlitt?" ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. And {{then in a}} day or two {{you came}} and <b>told</b> me that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> hadn't left {{anything}} and what there was went to his relations in England.|$|R
60|$|Then I <b>told</b> him of <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> cruel death; {{of what we}} {{had found}} to tell the horrible story, and before I had {{finished}} the tears were running down his cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|Then I hurriedly <b>told</b> of <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> arrival, and {{explained}} more fully than I had yet ventured {{to do his}} misconceptions and prejudices as to Eve. [...] "Now, I want you all," [...] said I, [...] "to help me to remove these prejudices and misconceptions {{as quickly as possible}} by falling in with my little plans." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay! I have <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> that, {{if we stay}} here, I hope he will lessen my allowance. Even then, I can pay off {{something}} {{every year}} of the debts that will be left after what would be cleared by the price of my commission.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It means, chiefly, a {{power of}} being disagreeable to one's own family, I think. I have that, perhaps. I didn't want to live at home, and I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> He didn't like it.... But then I have a sister, and you haven't, have you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's bearable, Bignall, but frightfully small. I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> that, if the First Lord didn't speedily {{regenerate}} the service, {{by building}} more comfortable vessels, the navy would get altogether into vulgar hands. Don't {{you find the}} motion excessively annoying in these single-deck'd ships, Bignall?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Most unwelcome, {{both for}} your own sake and for mine,' said she. 'For your sake because I suspected, as I have <b>told</b> you, that <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> {{intentions}} might be unfriendly. For mine--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not engaged, but <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{and mother}} {{know that we}} are {{attached}} to each other. It happened the day after you came to Eastwich, or they would have <b>told</b> you. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> made me promise that we would not correspond while I was away, as he thought that we were too young to bind ourselves to each other, especially as Anthony has no present prospects or means to support a wife." ...|$|R
60|$|Tor. Can {{you have}} grief, {{and not have}} pity too? He <b>told</b> me,--when <b>my</b> <b>father</b> did return, He had a wond'rous secret to disclose: He kissed me, blessed me, nay--he called me son; He praised my courage; prayed for my success: He was so true a father of his country, To thank me, for {{defending}} even his foes, Because they were his subjects.|$|R
