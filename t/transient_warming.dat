40|$|A {{generalized}} stability {{analysis is}} used to explore the excitation of sea-surface temperature anoma- lies in the eastern equatorial Pacific by optimal initial perturbations in temperature and salinity within an ocean general circulation model. We find perturbations that can efficiently modify the SST of the Nino 3 region with an approximately 9 -month delay. The time interval {{between the end of}} March and mid-April is particularly favorable for these perturbations to cause subsequent changes in the eastern equatorial Pacific. This sensitivity is related to two critical factors: during the boreal spring Equinox the heat content of the western equatorial Pacific reaches its seasonal maximum, whereas the zonal winds along the equator relax. The optimal initial anomalies in temperature and salinity have a complex spatial structure extending between 20 ?S and 20 ?N. This large meridional extent of the anomalies allows for a strong focus- ing effect - signals from different locations reach the eastern equatorial Pacific simultaneously thus generating a strong <b>transient</b> <b>warming</b> in a relatively small region. Ocean adjustment to the optimal perturbations involves a basin-size Rossby wave that propagates westward and induces a large-scale anomalous eastward advection along the equator, which acts on the mean east-west temperature gra- dient and gradually warms SST in the east. At the same time, a continuum of Kelvin waves are being excited, which reduce the thermocline slope along the equator and deepen the thermocline in the east- ern equatorial Pacific. Thus, the Rossby wave and Kelvin waves work constructively to generate the <b>transient</b> <b>warming</b> of the Nino 3 SST. An idealized model with two variables is formulated to illustrate these ideas and, in particular, show the importance of zonal advection feedback for the amplitude and duration of the <b>transient</b> <b>warming.</b> Ultimately, this study highlights the importance of non-normal dynamics for generating an efficient transient growth of SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific {{even in the absence of}} coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions...|$|E

40|$|The {{climate of}} early Mars has been hotly debated for decades. Although most {{investigators}} {{believe that the}} geology indicates the presence of surface water, disagreement has persisted regarding how warm and wet the surface must have been and how long such conditions may have existed. Although the geologic evidence is most easily explained by a persistently warm climate, the perceived difficulty that climate models have in generating warm surface conditions has seeded various models that assume a cold and glaciated early Mars punctuated by <b>transient</b> <b>warming</b> episodes. However, I use a single-column radiative-convective climate model {{to show that it}} is relatively more straightforward to satisfy warm and relatively unglaciated early Mars conditions, requiring only about 1 percent H 2 and 3 bar CO 2 or about 20 percent H 2 and 0. 55 bar CO 2. In contrast, the reflectivity of surface ice greatly increases the difficulty to transiently warm an initially frozen surface. Surface pressure thresholds required for warm conditions increase about 10 to 60 percent for <b>transient</b> <b>warming</b> models, depending on ice cover fraction. No warm solution is possible for ice cover fractions exceeding 40, 70, and 85 percent for mixed snow and ice and 25, 35, and 49 percent for fresher snow and ice at H 2 concentrations of 3, 10, and 20 percent, respectively. If high temperatures (298 to 323 K) were required to produce the observed surface clay amounts on a transiently warm early Mars (Bishop et al), I show that such temperatures would have required surface pressures that exceed available paleopressure constraints for nearly all H 2 concentrations considered (1 to 20 percent).

Based on a supraregional carbon isotope excursion, and a negative shift in oxygen isotopes in the Pacific {{it has been suggested}} that the LDE is an early Paleogene <b>transient</b> <b>warming</b> event. So far the environmental effects of the LDE have been observed in few sections and details on its impact and duration are scarce. We present a quantitative study of benthic foraminiferal assemblages retrieved from five sections along a depth transect on the Paleocene southern Tethyan shelf (Nile Basin, Egypt) to assess paleoenvironmental change during the LDE. The lithologic sequences and foraminiferal assemblages indicate that the onset of the LDE is related to widespread shelf dysoxia. The organic-rich laminated marls of lower LDE bed I contain levels devoid of benthic foraminifera. During the later stage of the LDE (dark-gray shales of bed II) the shelf is repopulated by a Neoeponides duwi benthic assemblage, occurring in all sections, initiating a gradual restoration of normal-marine shelf environments. Qmode and R-mode correspondence analysis assist in the interpretation of the N. duwi assemblage, which is related to disturbed conditions at the sea floor following oxygen depletion and increased organic loading. The sharp lithologic boundary at the base of the LDE suggests that the event coincides with a rapid transgression following a sea-level fall, with an estimated amplitude of ~ 50 m or less. Comparison with the Dan-C 2 and ELPE/MPBE, two proposed <b>transient</b> <b>warming</b> episodes preceding and postdating the LDE, shows that the three Paleocene events have several characteristics in common.

Evidence for ancient fluvio-lacustrine environments at Gale crater on Mars {{and a lack}} of efficient crustal recycling mechanisms on the planet suggests a surface environment that was once warm enough to allow the presence of liquid water, at least for discrete periods of time, and implies a greenhouse effect that may have been influenced by sulfur-bearing volcanic gases. Here we report in situ analyses of the sulfur isotopic compositions of SO 2 volatilized from ten sediment samples acquired by NASA’s Curiosity rover along a 13 [*]km traverse of Gale crater. We find large variations in sulfur isotopic composition that exceed those measured for Martian meteorites and show both depletion and enrichment in 34 S. Measured values of δ 34 S range from − 47 ± 14 ‰ to 28 ± 7 ‰, similar to the range typical of terrestrial environments.

40|$|By {{combining}} the strong points of general circulation models (GCMs), which contain detailed and complex processes, and Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs), which are quick {{and capable of}} large ensembles, we have developed a loosely coupled model (LCM) which can represent the outputs of a GCM-based Earth system model using much smaller computational resources. We {{address the problem of}} relatively poor representation of precipitation within our EMIC, which prevents us from directly coupling it to a vegetation model, by coupling it to a precomputed transient simulation using a full GCM. The LCM consists of three components: an EMIC (MIROC-lite) which consists of a 2 -D energy balance atmosphere coupled to a low resolution 3 -D GCM ocean including an ocean carbon cycle; a state of the art vegetation model (Sim-CYCLE); and a database of daily temperature, precipitation, and other necessary climatic fields to drive Sim-CYCLE from a precomputed transient simulation from a state of the art AOGCM. The <b>transient</b> <b>warming</b> of the climate system is calculated from MIROC-lite, with the global temperature anomaly used to select the most appropriate annual climatic field from the pre-computed AOGCM simulation which, in this case, is a 1 % pa increasing CO 2 concentration scenario. By adjusting the climate sensitivity of MIROC-lite, the <b>transient</b> <b>warming</b> of the LCM could be adjusted to closely follow the low sensitivity (4. 0 K) version of MIROC 3. 2. By tuning of the physical and biogeochemical parameters it was possible to reasonably reproduce the bulk physical and biogeochemical properties of previously published CO 2 stabilisation scenarios for that model. As an example of an application of the LCM, the behavior of the high sensitivity version of MIROC 3. 2 (with 6. 3 K climate sensitivity) is also demonstrated. Given the highly tunable nature of the model, we believe that the LCM should be a very useful tool for studying uncertainty in global climate change...|$|E

40|$|Earth's current icehouse phase began ? 34 m. y. {{ago with}} the onset of major Antarctic {{glaciation}} at the Eocene-Oligocene transition. Changes in ocean circulation and a decline in atmospheric greenhouse gas levels were associated with stepwise cooling and ice growth at southern high latitudes. The Antarctic cryosphere plays a critical role in the ocean-atmosphere system, but its early evolution is still poorly known. With a near-field record from Prydz Bay, Antarctica, we demonstrate that Antarctic ice growth was stepwise and had an earlier onset than previously suggested. Prydz Bay lies downstream of a major East Antarctic Ice Sheet drainage system, and its sedimentary records uniquely constrain the timing of ice-sheet advance onto the continental shelf. We investigated a detrital record extracted from three Ocean Drilling Program drill holes within a new depositional and chronological framework spanning the late Eocene to early Oligocene (ca. 36 ? 33 Ma). The chemical index of alteration (CIA) and the S index, calculated from the major-element geochemistry of bulk samples, yielded estimates of chemical weathering intensities and mean annual temperature on the East Antarctic continent. We document evidence for late Eocene mountain glaciation along with <b>transient</b> <b>warm</b> events at 35. 8 ? 34. 8 Ma. From 34. 4 Ma, associated with the Eocene-Oligocene transition precursor ? 18 O excursion, glaciers advanced into Prydz Bay, coincident with a decline in chemical weathering and temperature. We conclude that Antarctic continental ice growth commenced with the Eocene-Oligocene transition “precursor” glaciation, during a time of Subantarctic surface ocean cooling and a decline in atmospheric pCO 2. These results call for dynamic high-latitude feedbacks that are currently poorly represented in Earth system models and emphasize the need for additional near-field glacio-sedimentological, high-latitude sea-surface temperature and pCO 2 records across the Eocene-Oligocene transition...|$|R
40|$|The first images {{returned}} by the Mariner 7 spacecraft of the Martian surface showed a landscape heavily scared by impacts.

Further evidence for water erosion and surface modification {{has come from the}} Viking Spacecraft, Mars Pathfinder, Mars Global Surveyor's (MGS) Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), and Mars Odyssey's THEMIS instrument. In addition to network channels, this evidence includes apparent paleolake beds, fluvial fans and sedimentary layers. The estimated erosion rates necessary to explain the observed surface morphologies present a conundrum. The rates of erosion appear to be highest when the early sun was fainter and only 75 % as luminous as it is today. All of this evidence points to a very different climate than what exists on Mars today. The most popular paradigm for the formation of the valley networks is that Mars had at one time a warm (T average > 273), wetter and stable climate. Possible warming mechanisms have included increased surface pressures, carbon dioxide clouds and trace greenhouse gasses. Yet to date climate models {{have not been able to}} produce a continuously warm and wet early Mars. The rates of erosion appear to correlate with the rate at which Mars was impacted thus an alternate possibility is <b>transient</b> <b>warm</b> and wet conditions initiated by large impacts. It is widely accepted that even relatively small impacts (approx. 10 km) have altered the past climate of Earth to such an extent as to cause mass extinctions.

During this episode of <b>transient</b> <b>warming,</b> Southern Ocean temperatures gradually rose 4 to 6 ?C over ~ 500 ka, and then warmed ~ 1. 5 ?C more over a brief period {{at the peak of the}} MECO (40. 0 Ma). After the peak warming, rapid cooling occurred over ~ 200 ka returning the Southern Ocean waters to pre-MECO temperatures. Such prominent and <b>transient</b> <b>warming</b> may have affected (or been influenced) by a change in deep-water formation and circulation. Seawater Neodymium (Nd) isotope ratios are commonly used as a proxy for ocean circulation, however, due to the multiple column chemistry steps in sample preparation, traces of Nd are frequently lost throughout the methods. Consequently, in some samples, where Nd is scarce, it is difficult to record an isotope signal. Here we dissect our sample preparation procedures in order to best optimize Nd collection for isotope analysis. We test the yield of Nd through the columns and suggest and alternative in order for maximum collection. Additionally, we investigate the potential relationship between the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) and climate change during the MECO using a high-resolution record of water mass Nd isotopes at Ocean Drilling Project Site 464, in the North Pacific. An approximately - 1 ?Nd shift concurrent with warming occurs over an ~ 500 kyr period at about 42 Ma could suggest stronger water mass intrusion from the south or an increase in weathering to the surface ventilated source water of the Pacific.

The phase relationship between the benthic isotope record and eccentricity is similar to patterns documented for the Oligocene and Miocene confirming the role of orbital forcing as the pace maker for paleoclimatic variability on Milankovitch time scales. In addition, the record documents an unusual <b>transient</b> <b>warming</b> of 2 °C coeval with a 0. 6 per mil carbon isotope excursion {{and a decrease in}} carbonate content at 61. 75 Ma.

The reason for this is two-fold. First, current <b>transient</b> <b>warming</b> lags significantly below equilibrium or “committed” warming. Second, almost all climate models indicate warming rates over land are much higher than those for the oceans. We demonstrate this potential for high eventual temperatures over land, even for contemporary GHG levels, using a large set of climate models and for which climate sensitivities are known. Such additional land warming has implications for impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and human well-being. This suggests that even if massive and near-immediate emissions reductions occur such that atmospheric GHGs increase further by only small amounts, careful planning is needed by society to prepare for higher land temperatures in an eventual equilibrium climatic state...|$|E
40|$|The Haughton impact {{structure}} {{has been the}} focus of systematic, multi-disciplinary field and laboratory research activities over the past several years. Regional geological mapping has refined the sedimentary target stratigraphy and constrained the thickness of the sedimentary sequence at the time of impact to similar to 1880 m. New Ar- 40 -Ar- 39 dates place the impact event at similar to 39 Ma, in the late Eocene. Haughton has an apparent crater diameter of similar to 23 km, with an estimated run (final crater) diameter of similar to 16 km. The structure lacks a central topographic peak or peak ring, which is unusual for craters of this size. Geological mapping and sampling reveals that a series of different impactites are present at Haughton. The volumetrically dominant crater-fill impact melt breccias contain a calcite-anhydrite-silicate glass groundmass, all of which have been shown to represent impact-generated melt phases. These impactites are, therefore, stratigraphically and genetically equivalent to coherent impact melt rocks present in craters developed in crystalline targets. The crater-fill impactites provided a heat source that drove a post-impact hydrothermal system. During this time. Haughton would have represented a <b>transient,</b> <b>warm,</b> wet microbial oasis. A subsequent episode of erosion, during which time substantial amounts of impactites were removed, was followed by the deposition of intra-crater lacustrine sediments of the Haughton Formation during the Miocene. Present-day intra-crater lakes and ponds preserve a detailed paleoenvironmental record dating back to the last glaciation in the High Arctic. Modern modification of the landscape is dominated by seasonal regional glacial and niveal melting, and local periglacial processes.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 Radiative {{feedbacks}} robustly vary {{over time}} in <b>transient</b> <b>warming</b> simulations. Published studies offer two explanations: (i) evolving patterns of ocean heat uptake (OHU) or radiative forcing give rise to OHU or forcing efficacies, and (ii) evolving patterns of surface temperature change. This study seeks to determine whether these explanations are indeed distinct/different. By first using an idealized framework of an aquaplanet atmosphere-only model, we show radiative feedbacks depend on the pattern of climate forcing. Yet, the same feedbacks arise when the temperature pattern induced by that climate forcing is prescribed {{in the absence of}} any forcing. These findings suggest the perspective that feedbacks are influenced by efficacies of forcing and OHU is equivalent to the perspective that feedbacks are dependent on the temperature patterns induced by those forcings. We additionally show that, while there are slight caveats when sea ice and land are included, in general this result holds in more realistic model setups. Thus, prescribed surface temperature simulations are valuable for studying the transient evolution of radiative feedbacks...|$|E
40|$|The early Cenozoic, {{which is}} punctuated by several {{negative}} carbon isotope excursions (CIEs), {{was a time}} of climatic and oceanographic transition from ’Greenhouse’ to ’Icehouse’ conditions. The occurrence of a 0. 5 & CIE starting at the top of Chron C 27 n (TC 27 N) is reconfirmed with stable isotope data from Zumaia (Spain) and Bjala (Bulgaria) localities. Spectral analysis on respective carbonate ⁄magnetic susceptibility proxy records substantiates the orbital cyclostratigraphy allowing correlation to a high-resolution benthic foraminifera isotope record from ODP Pacific Site 1209, that indicates a coeval 2 C <b>transient</b> <b>warming.</b> The hyperthermal event lasts 200 ka, contrasting with other short-lived events from the Eocene, and displays a relatively rapid onset and a longer tailing back to pre-event values similar to the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), though lower in amplitude. That a causal trigger for the TC 27 N event may be the onset of volcanism in the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) can be inferred from a 200 -m-thick lava pile erupted during C 27 n ⁄ C 26 r polarity transition in the E Greenland margin...|$|E
40|$|A {{prominent}} middle Eocene warming {{event is}} identified in Southern Ocean deep-sea cores, indicating that long-term cooling {{through the middle}} and late Eocene was not monotonic. At sites on Maud Rise and the Kerguelen Plateau, a distinct negative shift in d 18 O values (~ 1. 0 per mil) is observed ca. 41. 5 Ma. This excursion is interpreted as primarily a temperature signal, with a <b>transient</b> <b>warming</b> of 4 °C over 600 k. y. affecting both surface and middle-bathyal deep waters in the Indian-Atlantic region of the Southern Ocean. This isotopic event is designated as the middle Eocene climatic optimum, and is interpreted to represent a significant climatic reversal {{in the midst of}} middle to late Eocene deep-sea cooling. The lack of a significant negative carbon isotope excursion, as observed during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum, and the gradual rate of high-latitude warming suggest that this event was not triggered by methane hydrate dissociation. Rather, a transient rise in pCO 2 levels is suspected, possibly as a result of metamorphic decarbonation in the Himalayan orogen or increased ridge/arc volcanism during the late middle Eocene...|$|E
40|$|We {{estimate}} the additional <b>transient</b> surface <b>warming</b> Delta T-s {{caused by a}} potential reduction of marine dimethyl sulfide (DMS) production due to ocean acidification under the high-emission scenario RCP 8. 5 until the year 2200. Since we use a fully coupled Earth system model, our results include a range of feedbacks, such as the response of marine DMS production to the additional changes in temperature and sea ice cover. Our results are broadly {{consistent with the findings}} of a previous study that employed an offline model set-up. Assuming a medium (strong) sensitivity of DMS production to pH, we find an additional <b>transient</b> global <b>warming</b> of 0. 30 K (0. 47 K) {{towards the end of the}} 22 nd century when DMS emissions are reduced by 7. 3 Tg S yr(- 1) or 31 % (11. 5 Tg S yr(- 1) or 48 %). The main mechanism behind the additional warming is a reduction of cloud albedo, but a change in shortwave radiative fluxes under clear-sky conditions due to reduced sulfate aerosol load also contributes significantly. We find an approximately linear relationship between reduction of DMS emissions and changes in top of the atmosphere radiative fluxes as well as changes in surface temperature for the range of DMS emissions considered here. For example, global average T-s changes by- 0. 041 K per 1 Tg S yr(- 1) change in sea-air DMS fluxes. The additional warming in our model has a pronounced asymmetry between northern and southern high latitudes. It is largest over the Antarctic continent, where the additional temperature increase of 0. 56 K (0. 89 K) is almost twice the global average. We find that feedbacks are small on the global scale due to opposing regional contributions. The most pronounced feed-back is found for the Southern Ocean, where we estimate that the additional climate change enhances sea-air DMS fluxes by about 9 % (15 %), which counteracts the reduction due to ocean acidification...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} ocean heat uptake (OHU) on <b>transient</b> global <b>warming</b> is studied in a {{multimodel}} framework. Simple heat sinks are prescribed in shallow aquaplanet ocean mixed layers underlying atmospheric general circulation models independently and combined with CO_ 2 forcing. Sinks are localized to either tropical or high latitudes, representing distinct modes of OHU found in coupled simulations. Tropical OHU produces modest cooling at all latitudes, offsetting {{only a fraction}} of CO_ 2 warming. High-latitude OHU produces three times more global mean cooling in a strongly polar-amplified pattern. Global sensitivities in each scenario are set primarily by large differences in local shortwave cloud feedbacks, robust across models. Differences in atmospheric energy transport set the pattern of temperature change. Results imply that global and regional warming rates depend sensitively on regional ocean processes setting the OHU pattern, and that equilibrium climate sensitivity cannot be reliably estimated from transient observations...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} vibration, flow <b>transients,</b> and <b>warm</b> gas {{pressurization}} on capillary acquisition system performance were evaluated. The degradation observed under wide band random and high frequency sinusoidal vibration {{was of a}} substantially different nature from that obtained under low frequency sinusoidal vibration. With the former, ingestion of small gas bubbles into the liquid region was correlated by a hydrostatic model, while the capillary stability was destroyed and liquid was lost from the liquid region with the latter. No degradation was observed {{as a result of}} flow transients in a flight-type multichannel screen device, but it was observed in a transparent laboratory device. Liquid hydrogen outflow tests were conducted with a multilayer dual-screen-liner system with both helium and hydrogen pressurant gases. The tendency towards dryout of the device with hydrogen pressurant was found to increase with increasing pressurant temperature and length of prepressurization period. Dryout did not occur with helium pressurant...|$|R
