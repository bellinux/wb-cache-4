5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> were {{defeated}} in Surabaya, rebel forces campaigning {{in the interior}} of Central and East Java had more success. The rebel campaign culminated in the fall of the capital Plered in June 1677. The king was ill, and distrust among the royal princes prevented organized resistance. The king fled west with the crown prince and his retinue, allowing <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> to enter and plunder the capital with little fighting. <b>The</b> <b>rebels</b> then withdrew to Kediri, taking the royal treasury with them.|$|E
5|$|By noon, <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> of the 108th Infantry Regiment were {{approaching}} Bjelovar, {{where they were}} joined by elements of the 42nd Infantry Regiment and other units of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska. The leader of <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> in Bjelovar was Kapetan Ivan Mrak, a reserve aviator. When Nedeljković became aware of <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> approach, he ordered the local gendarmerie commander to maintain order, but was advised this would not be possible, as local conscripts would not report for duty. Headquarters of the 4th Army reported the presence of <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> to Headquarters 1st Army Group, and it was suggested that the VVKJ could bomb the rebel units. The 8th Bomber Regiment at Rovine was even warned to receive orders to use its Bristol Blenheim Mk I light bombers to bomb the 108th Infantry Regiment, but the idea was subsequently abandoned. Instead, it was decided to request that the leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, Vladko Maček intervene with <b>the</b> <b>rebels.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rebels</b> had {{multiple}} sources for arms, {{but did not}} possess heavy weaponry, {{with the exception of}} two artillery pieces. Sources for weapons included the Turkish forces in southern Anatolia, Bedouin tribes who either sold or smuggled Mauser rifles to <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> that the Germans had distributed to the tribes during World War I, weapon stockpiles left behind by Ottoman troops fleeing Syria during the British-Arab offensive in 1918, and raids against French arms warehouses. The rebels' arsenal largely consisted of German Mauser rifles, revolvers, shotguns, and Turkish five-shooters, as well as sabres and daggers. According to Khoury, <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> also possessed twelve light machine guns. Following the destruction of the Arab government in July 1920, the Turks became the main arms suppliers of <b>the</b> <b>rebels.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rebels</b> distinguished the Turkish armed movement in Anatolia from the Ottomans, who <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> viewed negatively, by stressing the role of Turkish general Mustafa Kemal, who was viewed as the quintessential guerrilla leader in the struggle against French occupation.|$|E

5|$|At dawn on 29 June, <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> {{attacked}} the Ustaše {{in a village}} on the Mostar–Nevesinje road. Prohaska demanded help from Mostar, and planned to send a force from Nevesinje to assist. From Mostar, a company of the 21st Battalion was despatched to relieve the Ustaše, who had managed to hold off <b>the</b> <b>rebels.</b> The Home Guard company then took over the post from the Ustaše. The same day, two new battalions arrived in Mostar, the 23rd Battalion from Osijek and the 15th Battalion from Travnik. These reinforcements arrived just as Prpić received confirmation that Avtovac had been captured by <b>the</b> <b>rebels.</b> The remaining small garrison in Gacko, consisting of only 20 gendarmes and 30 Ustaše, were holding out but expecting more attacks by <b>the</b> <b>rebels.</b> In the morning, the attack by elements of the 10th Battalion stalled until the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Julije Reš, personally took command of the operation, {{clearing the way for}} the Italians. The promised Italian intervention commenced about midday, and about 100 trucks of Italian soldiers arrived in Gacko about 17:00. As they had passed through Avtovac, <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> had left the town and withdrawn to villages to the east. About 18:00, the 10th Battalion relieved the besieged gendarmes in the village schoolhouse. ZNDH aircraft from Mostar airfield flew reconnaissance sorties over the area and dropped leaflets over Stolac, Stepen, Avtovac, Gacko and Plužine.|$|E

5|$|For decades, {{rebels in}} Cuba had waged an {{intermittent}} campaign for freedom from Spanish colonial rule. By 1895, the conflict had expanded {{to a war}} for Cuban independence. As war engulfed the island, Spanish reprisals against <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> grew ever harsher. American public opinion favored <b>the</b> <b>rebels,</b> and McKinley shared in their outrage against Spanish policies. However while public opinion called for war to liberate Cuba, McKinley favored a peaceful approach, hoping that through negotiation, Spain might be convinced to grant Cuba independence, {{or at least to}} allow the Cubans some measure of autonomy. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but it became clear that Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> (and their American supporters) would never settle for anything less.|$|E

In addition, the Romans began working to drive <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> out of the countryside offering forgiveness to any tribes that would lay down their arms, and a scorched earth policy was implemented through which Tiberius may have been hoping to starve the enemy out. While most of his detachments saw little action at the time, Germanicus did defeat the Mazaei, a Dalmatian tribe.|$|E
