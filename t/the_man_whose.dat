25|$|Leontius was {{in prison}} when a monk once {{told him that he}} would one day wear the Imperial diadem. Such talk was not only {{dangerous}} for the monk (who if discovered would have been blinded and exiled for treason) but also dangerous for <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>whose</b> ears received— and preyed upon Leontius' mind until in 695 (after being released) he immediately began a relatively unplanned coup. Fortunately for him many of his comrades had also been imprisoned (suggesting that perhaps his entire unit may well have been disgraced) so when he marched upon his former prison to release the inmates, many declared their support for him.|$|E
25|$|A {{young woman}} named Suzu, who is {{innocent}} and loves drawing, lives in a seaside town called Eba in Hiroshima City. In 1944, 18-year-old Suzu, working for her grandmother's small family business of cultivating Nori (edible sea weed), is told by her parents that an unknown young man has come to propose marriage to her. <b>The</b> <b>man,</b> <b>whose</b> name is Shūsaku, lives in Kure City, a large naval port city 15 miles away from Hiroshima City, as a navy civilian. He remembers that he and Suzu had first met during one of Suzu's childhood visits to the city. Suzu decides to marry him and moves to join Shūsaku's family in Kure. As Suzu adjusts to her new life in Kure, {{the threat of the}} Pacific War slowly begins to encroach on the daily lives of the townspeople.|$|E
25|$|In February 1931 Morshead {{stayed in}} Burma {{while the rest}} of the family {{returned}} to England for reasons of schooling. It was a time of unrest. A rebellion had started in Burma, against British rule, and Thakin rebels were in the vicinity of Maymyo. A colleague of Morshead had been shot at by a disaffected Survey employee who had been convicted of attempted murder. On 17 May 1931 Morshead set off riding by himself and later that day his riderless pony was discovered back in Maymyo. After extensive searching his body was found next day in the jungle nearby. He had been shot in the chest at point blank range. Two people were arrested, an ex-Gurkha who had been out shooting at the time, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>whose</b> gun he had been using. There was no apparent motive and no charges were ever brought because both men seemed to have alibis.|$|E

25|$|After {{finishing}} {{fourth in}} 1985, the Astros fired general manager Al Rosen and manager Bob Lillis. The former was supplanted by Dick Wagner, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>whose</b> Reds defeated the Astros {{to win the}} 1979 NL West title. The latter was replaced by Hal Lanier who, like his manager mentor in St. Louis, Whitey Herzog, had a hard-nosed approach to managing and espoused a playing style that focused on pitching, defense, and speed rather than home runs to win games. This style of baseball, known as Whiteyball, took advantage of stadiums with deep fences and artificial turf, {{both of which were}} characteristics of the Astrodome. Lanier's style of baseball took Houston by storm. Before Lanier took over, fans were accustomed to Houston's occasional slow starts, but with Lanier leading the way, Houston got off to a hot start, winning 13 of their first 19 contests.|$|E
25|$|Republic. This {{regime is}} {{ruled by a}} philosopher king, and thus is {{grounded}} on wisdom and reason. The aristocratic state, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>whose</b> nature corresponds to it, are the objects of Plato's analyses {{throughout much of the}} Republic, as opposed to the other four types of states/men, who are discussed later in his work. In Book VIII, Plato states in order the other four imperfect societies with a description of the state's structure and individual character. In timocracy the ruling class is made up primarily of those with a warrior-like character. In his description, Plato has Sparta in mind. Oligarchy is made up of a society in which wealth is the criterion of merit and the wealthy are in control. In democracy, the state bears resemblance to ancient Athens with traits such as equality of political opportunity and freedom for the individual to do as he likes. Democracy then degenerates into tyranny from the conflict of rich and poor. It is characterized by an undisciplined society existing in chaos, where the tyrant rises as popular champion leading to the formation of his private army and the growth of oppression.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the elders}} of the village did not approve and did nothing to help her, Lillinonah nursed the {{stricken}} Englishman through {{all the rest of}} the long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along the road to recovery, thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>whose</b> life she had saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was so different from her own? Was it not true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man.|$|E

500|$|To {{decide who}} would become the monarch, six of them decided on a test, with Otanes abstaining, as he had no {{interest}} in being king. They were to gather outside the palace, mounted on their horses at sunrise, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>whose</b> horse neighed first in recognition of the rising sun would become king. According to Herodotus, Darius had a slave, Oebares, who rubbed his hand over the genitals of a mare that Darius favored. When the six gathered, Oebares placed his hands beside the nostrils of Darius's horse, who became excited at the scent and neighed. This was followed by lightning and thunder, leading the others to dismount and kneel before Darius in recognition of his apparent divine providence. In this account, Darius himself favored that he achieved the throne not through fraud, but cunning, even erecting a statue of himself mounted on his neighing horse with the inscription: [...] "Darius, son of Hystaspes, obtained the sovereignty of Persia by the sagacity of his horse and the ingenious contrivance of Oebares, his groom." ...|$|E

500|$|Out of the ruts and {{the ways}} of its village, Selborne {{fashioned}} a new natural history. [...] It spoke simply, with a human voice. [...] But it looked profoundly. [...] It pioneered a way for students of nature who wished, as White did, not to roam the high Arctic or far Pacific but to fathom their own terrain. [...] It offered a wide world to anyone willing to dig deep. [...] Selborne said: [...] watch narrowly, skim close to the ground. [...] It whispered, hushed, what Thoreau would later broadcast: [...] "We are acquainted with a mere pellicle of the globe on which we live. [...] Most have not delved six feet beneath the surface, nor leaped as many above it. [...] We know not where we are."

500|$|The republished version enjoyed greater {{success than}} the original. Although, {{by the time}} of his death in 1968, Steinbeck's {{reputation}} was at an all-time low owing to his mediocre output during the last decades of his life and his support for American involvement in Vietnam, his books have slowly regained their popularity. The Log from the Sea of Cortez became an important work within his oeuvre, not only as an interesting travelogue and work of non-fiction, but for its first-hand account of Ed Ricketts, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>whose</b> thinking had so much influence on the course of Steinbeck's writing and on whom he had based so many of his pivotal characters. Whereas earlier critics mostly assumed that [...] "Mr. Ricketts contributed some of the biology, and Mr. Steinbeck all of the prose", the publication of Ricketts' rediscovered original notes in 2003 has revealed how closely Steinbeck followed Ricketts' journal. This has forced a re-evaluation of how far it is fair to attribute authorship of the narrative portion of Sea of Cortez to Steinbeck, and has caused critics to view the removal of Ricketts' name from the cover as reflecting badly on Steinbeck.|$|E

[...] When contacted, the JP at Long Sutton (a Mr Delamere) confirmed that John Palmer had lived there for about nine months, but that he was suspected of stealing sheep, and had escaped the custody of the local constable. [...] Delamere also suspected that Palmer was a horse-thief and had taken several depositions supporting his view, and told the three JPs that he would prefer him to be detained. [...] The three JPs now presumed that the case was too serious for Palmer to remain at Beverley House of Correction, and demanded sureties for his appearance at York Assizes. [...] Turpin refused, and so on 16October he was transferred to York Castle in handcuffs.|$|E

500|$|In 1804, the United States Congress {{passed a}} statute {{requiring}} {{the secretary of}} the treasury to build a lighthouse at Five Mile Point if land could be obtained for a reasonable price. That same year, Amos Morris, Jr., son of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>whose</b> home was the first to be razed during the 1779 British invasion, sold a suitable one-acre plot of his father's coastal estate to the federal government for $100. On March 16, 1805, an appropriation for $2500 was issued for the construction of the lighthouse. Late that year, a [...] octagonal wooden tower was built by Abisha Woodward on the southwest edge of the harbor and to mark the path around the Southwest Ledge. The fixed white light was made by eight oil lamps with [...] parabolic reflectors, but it was criticized for being too dim. The lighthouse also had a keeper's quarters constructed in 1805. The first keeper of the light was Amos Morris Jr., for a period of just three weeks. An 1832 report noted that the light was [...] above the water and that its visibility had been improved with the removal of some trees. In 1838, [...] Lieutenant George M. Bache reported that the wooden tower and keeper's house was in a poor state. Congress would appropriate $10,000 to construct a new stone lighthouse on March 3, 1847.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from December 17, 1910.

On the same night, Jack Deming, a friend of Tom's who has lost heavily in speculation on Tom's advice, calls at the latter's rooms, very much intoxicated, brandishing a revolver and vowing vengeance. Tom calms his excited visitor, who falls asleep on the couch, after which Tom writes {{a letter to his}} former sweetheart and dispatches it by his servant. When the servant returns, he discovers his master dead on the floor of his apartment and Jack just leaving the room revolver in hand. Jack is arrested on suspicion, and young Miss Marsh , a bright young woman in the detective department, is detailed from headquarters to investigate the case. She does some clever work in the case, and proves Jack's innocence in a novel way, incidentally falling in love with <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>whose</b> life she is working to save. On the strength of her evidence, Jack is set free; and with love to live for, he starts out to make a new record in life for himself." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 1902, Dunlap died penniless {{and alone}} at age 43. According to the Sporting Life, the [...] "last {{two years of}} his life were spent in abject poverty and mental gloom" [...] in a Philadelphia {{boarding}} house. According to several accounts, a policeman at the morgue saw the body and believed it to be Dunlap. [...] Lave Cross was called to the morgue and confirmed that the body was Dunlap. [...] His funeral was poorly attended by his former baseball colleagues, and one former player who did attend observed, [...] "There were not enough friends of Dunlap at his funeral to bury him and we had to call on the hack drivers to make up the list of active pall-bearers." [...] Following Dunlap's death, William A. Phelon, Jr., editor of Sporting Life wrote:"So Fred Dunlap has passed into the great beyond, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>whose</b> salary figure marked the high-water limit of the long ago is gone! ...
