5|$|The Diet was {{initially}} dominated by Polish nobles, but in time, it saw <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> a strong peasant faction. Another notable {{change over time}} included <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> a Ruthenian (modern Ukrainian) bloc, changing {{the balance of power}} within the body. Overall, the Diet preserved the Polish parliamentary tradition during a time in which it waned in the Prussian Partition and the Russian Partition, and saw <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> the major political parties and groupings that were to dominate the political life of the Second Polish Republic after World War I. The leader of the Polish peasant movement in the Second Polish Republic, Wincenty Witos, gained his experience in the Diet, elected {{for the first time in}} 1908. Similarly, the National Democrats, and the Polish socialists, had their political blocs in the diet around that time.|$|E

40|$|The authors model <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> {{processes}} <b>of</b> road obstacles, such as fallen {{objects on}} roads, the deformation {{and destruction of}} pavements, and the damage and destruction of road facilities, as counting processes. Especially, {{in order to take}} into account <b>the</b> heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> risk <b>of</b> a variety of road obstacles, the authors model a mixture Poisson process in which the arrival rate of road obstacles is subject to a probability distribution. In detail, the authors formulate a Poisson-Gamma model expressing the heterogeneity of the arrival rate as a Gamma distribution and formulate the management indicator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> risk <b>of</b> road obstacles. Then, a methodology is developed in order to design a road patrol policy that can minimize the road obstacle risk with a limited amount of budget. Furthermore, the authors empirically verify {{that it is possible to}} design road patrol policy based on <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> risk <b>of</b> actual road obstacles with the proposed methodology, by studying the cases of the application of the methodology to general national roads...|$|R
