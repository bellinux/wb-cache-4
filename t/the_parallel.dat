5|$|In {{the film}} sequel , Alphonse {{continues}} {{searching for his}} brother until learning {{that he is in}} a parallel world. With help from the homunculus Wrath, Alphonse opens the gate to <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> world, {{but at the same time}} causes a soldier named Dietline Eckhart, who is from <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> world, to start attacking Amestris. Joining forces with Edward, Alphonse defeats Eckhart and decides to stay with his brother to live in <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> world.|$|E
5|$|Walter (John Noble) has {{prepared}} himself to reveal to Peter (Joshua Jackson) the truththat {{he is from}} <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universewhen they are called to a case. Two teenagers were found dead, evidently killed by shapeshifter agents from <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe. Exploring the nearby area, they find a third unformed shapeshifter which Walter takes to the lab to study. At the same time of the teenagers' death, they find a carrier signal in the local television. With biotechnology corporation Massive Dynamic's help, they determine that the signal emanated from <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe during a brief moment that the two universes were in sync, and that the next point of synchronization would occur the next afternoon. Recalling Thomas Jerome Newton's (Sebastian Roché) previous attempt to bring a building from <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe into the prime, the Fringe team believes they must stop this next attempt.|$|E
5|$|A {{localized}} {{earthquake in}} New York City damages only one building, killing nearly all inside. The Fringe team discovers {{that a second}} building appeared at the same location as the first, fusing the structure and people inside together. Walter (John Noble) realizes that the second building has been pulled from <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe by Thomas Jerome Newton, using the technology that Walter and William Bell had discovered years ago. Walter warns that because of conservation of mass, a building of similar mass will be taken from the prime universe to <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> one {{sometime in the next}} few days.|$|E

5|$|As {{the episode}} ends, Olivia's {{hallucination}} of Peter points {{out to her}} {{that there is a}} way to tell if she is from the prime universe: by confirming her memories of her niece Ella, who did not survive birth in <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe. During Olivia's final test in the tank, she is again able to cross over to the gift shop in the prime universe. She is able to recall Ella's phone number and calls her, but is brought back to <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe shortly after Ella answers. As she is removed from the tank, she lies, telling Walternate the test did not work.|$|E
5|$|At Nina's recommendation, Olivia {{meets with}} Sam Weiss, {{who works at}} a bowling alley. He tells her to expect {{headaches}} as one consequence of crossing universes. The final scene shows the shapeshifted Charlie communicating with someone from <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe, who tells him to help make Olivia remember her experience crossing over.|$|E
5|$|Back in {{the prime}} universe, Peter and Fauxlivia are in bed {{together}} when Peter receives {{a call from the}} cleaning lady, who relays the message: that Olivia is trapped in <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe. Peter realizes that he has been sleeping with Olivia's doppelgänger.|$|E
50|$|A {{convenient}} {{source of}} <b>the</b> <b>parallels</b> is Thomas Keightley devotes his Chapter VII of his Tales and Popular Fictions (1834) boasting {{he has made}} the largest compilation of these parallels, though {{he was not the}} first to make note of <b>the</b> <b>parallels</b> in published form.|$|R
40|$|A new {{equivalent}} {{map projection}} called <b>the</b> <b>parallels</b> plane projection is proposed in this paper. The transverse axis of <b>the</b> <b>parallels</b> plane projection is {{the expansion of}} the equator and its vertical axis equals half the length of the central meridian. On <b>the</b> <b>parallels</b> plane projection, meridians are projected as sine curves and parallels are a series of straight, parallel lines. No distortion of length occurs along the central meridian or on any parallels of this projection. Angular distortion and the proportion of length along meridians (except the central meridian) introduced by the projection transformation increase with increasing longitude and latitude. A potential application of <b>the</b> <b>parallels</b> plane projection is that it can provide an efficient projection transformation for global discrete grid systems. © Science in China Press 2007...|$|R

5|$|Elizabeth and Peter {{return to}} Reiden Lake, and Peter {{eventually}} comes to call Elizabeth his mom, but Elizabeth becomes forlorn after she realizes the lie {{she has been}} maintaining {{for the last few}} months. The episode ends in <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe, where Walternate has reviewed Olivia's sketchbook, including her latest picture of her and Peter; now aware of <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe, Walternate gains new resolve to get his Peter back.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Bengt Strömgren {{introduced}} the term Hertzsprung–Russell diagram to denote a luminosity-spectral class diagram. This name reflected <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> {{development of this}} technique by both Hertzsprung and Russell earlier in the century.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Finley has {{disagreed}} with these claims. Critics claim that <b>the</b> <b>parallels</b> drawn by Nibley and others ignore {{the possibility of}} simple coincidence and lack a defined methodology for assessing the importance of <b>the</b> <b>parallels.</b> Tvetdnes and Roper responded by noting {{that there are too}} many coincidences for such an assessment to be credible.|$|R
50|$|Darrin uses <b>the</b> <b>parallels</b> {{to create}} {{favorable}} outcomes one by sending his duplicates into a Parallel {{to test for}} a specific outcome, if they failed he deletes that Parallel, if they succeed he uses their solution.

5|$|Olivia (Anna Torv) has {{recovered}} from her ordeal of being trapped in <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe and has rejoined the Fringe team, while {{others on the}} team, particularly Peter (Joshua Jackson), struggle {{with the idea that}} <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe's Olivia, Fauxlivia, had successfully pretended to be Olivia. Throughout the episode, Olivia is shown to be struggling emotionally with knowing that Fauxlivia has lived in her apartment and has slept with Peter.|$|E
5|$|Olivia {{suggests}} {{the possibility that}} the effect is due to quantum entanglement between Alice in the prime universe and Derek in <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> one. Alice previously told Olivia that Derek died recently from trying to replace a faulty fuse after they flipped a coin to decide who would replace it, and Walter surmises that <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe Alice died in a similar fashion due to a different outcome of the coin flip. Alice's connection to <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe Derek is causing the crack. As the building starts to exhibit the initial signs of a singularity and Broyles (Lance Reddick) prepares to release the amber, Olivia and Peter attempt to persuade Alice that the man she sees is not really her husband. Alice does not believe them until Derek starts to refer to their children. Alice, who is childless, realizes Peter and Olivia are telling the truth; the connection is broken and the effects on the building ebb away.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying to listen for each other.|$|E
5|$|The episode ends in <b>the</b> <b>parallel</b> {{universe}} where Olivia, having broken Walternate's conditioning {{making her}} believe {{herself to be}} Fauxlivia, is told that no further tests are needed.
