5|$|Eventually NSB felt {{confident}} that they had found a <b>technical</b> <b>solution</b> that would be satisfactory, and ordered another six units to allow all trains on the Dovre, Bergen and Sørland Lines to be hauled with the class. Units 2227–2232 were delivered in 1987, and put into regular service on the Sørland Line. Although better than the first series, the second series was also prone to technical problems, and never entered regular service on the Bergen Line. During the 1990s, they were also put into service on the regional rail services on the Vestfold and Gjøvik Lines. The units were never well-liked by NSB, {{in part because of}} the bad name the first series had given, and partly because the number of available units was unpredictable. It also took a while for NSB to discover that asynchronous locomotives needed to be operated differently. The locomotives had been designed to haul a six-car train, but NSB regularly needed to haul eight-car trains, and therefore instead used the more powerful El 16.|$|E

25|$|The {{disconnecting}} {{circuit breaker}} (DCB) {{was introduced in}} 2000 and is a high-voltage circuit breaker modeled after the SF6-breaker. It presents a <b>technical</b> <b>solution</b> where the disconnecting function is integrated in the breaking chamber, {{eliminating the need for}} separate disconnectors. This increases the availability, since open-air disconnecting switch main contacts need maintenance every 2–6 years, while modern circuit breakers have maintenance intervals of 15 years. Implementing a DCB solution also reduces the space requirements within the substation, and increases the reliability, {{due to the lack of}} separate disconnectors.|$|E

25|$|The SVR {{have been}} offered first refusal by BRB (Residuary) Ltd. on the all-important tunnel under Bridgnorth as the first {{essential}} part of the plan. If the Telford Steam Railway were to expand and cross the river Severn via the Albert Edward Bridge and operate to the original site of Buildwas Junction station, it would operate over a very short part of the former Severn Valley Line. The planned closure of Ironbridge Power Station In 2015 further adds to the debate because this covers the site of Buildwas Junction station. However, there are several obstacles to overcome, not least of which is that all of the land north of Bridgnorth tunnel is in private ownership. The Holybush Road was widened and raised after closure, impeding access to the southern portal of Bridgnorth tunnel. The group currently promoting such an extension has identified a viable <b>technical</b> <b>solution</b> to this and other difficulties.|$|E

500|$|A {{key feature}} of Sgt. Pepper is Martin and Emerick's liberal use of signal {{processing}} {{to shape the}} sound of the recording, which included the application of dynamic range compression, reverberation and signal limiting. Relatively new modular effects units were used, such as running voices and instruments through a Leslie speaker. Several innovative production techniques feature prominently on the recordings, including direct injection, pitch control and ambiophonics. Another is automatic double tracking (ADT), a system that uses tape recorders to create a simultaneous doubling of a sound. Although it had long been recognised that using multitrack tape to record doubled lead vocals produced an enhanced sound, before ADT it had been necessary to record such vocal tracks twice, a task that was both tedious and exacting. ADT was invented by Townsend during the Revolver sessions in 1966 especially for the Beatles, who disliked tracking sessions and regularly expressed a desire for a <b>technical</b> <b>solution</b> to the problem. The process soon became a common recording practice in popular music. Martin playfully explained to Lennon that his voice had been [...] "treated with a double vibrocated sploshing flange... It doubles your voice, John." [...] Lennon realised that Martin was joking, but from that point on he referred to the effect as flanging, a label that was universally adopted by the music industry. Another important effect was varispeeding. Martin cites [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] as having the most variations of tape speed on Sgt. Pepper. During the recording of Lennon's vocals, the tape speed was reduced from 50 cycles per second to 45, which produced a higher and thinner-sounding track when played back at the normal speed.|$|E
2500|$|Hot {{water can}} cause painful, {{dangerous}} scalding injuries, especially {{in children and}} the elderly. Water at the outlet should not exceed 49 degrees Celsius. Some jurisdictions {{set a limit of}} 49 degrees on tank setpoint temperature. [...] On the other hand, water stored below 60 degrees Celsius can permit the growth of bacteria, such as those that cause Legionnaire's disease, which is a particular danger to those with compromised immune systems. One <b>technical</b> <b>solution</b> would be use of mixing valves at outlets used for sinks, baths or showers, that would automatically mix cold water to maintain a maximum below 49 C. A proposal to add this to the building code of Canada was unsuccessful.|$|E
2500|$|The {{acoustic}} {{distortion of}} a diver's speech {{is due in}} part to the difference in density of the breathing gas, which causes a non-linear shift of low-pitch vocal resonance, due to resonance shifts in the vocal cavities, giving a nasal effect, and a linear shift of vocal resonances which is a function of the velocity of sound in the gas, known as the Donald Duck effect. Another effect of higher density is the relative increase in intensity of voiced sounds relative to unvoiced sounds. The contrast between closed and open voiced sounds decreases with increasing pressure. The contrast between voiced consonants and adjacent vowels also decreases with increased pressure.

40|$|Abstract. Service {{governance}} {{is a set}} {{of businesses}} processes, policies and <b>technical</b> <b>solutions</b> that support enterprises in their implementation and management of their SOA. The decisions of service governance, especially concerning service boundaries at the enterprise level, influence the deployment topology of business services across or within business organizations. Deployment topologies are realized by integration technologies such as Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). Service governance and <b>technical</b> <b>solutions</b> interact in a subtle way including through communication patterns and protocols between services and ESBs, as well as the deployment and configuration of ESB. These factors have a strong influence on the Non-Functional Properties (NFP) of a SOA solution. A systematic approach is essential to understand alternative <b>technical</b> <b>solutions</b> for a specific service governance decision. This paper proposes a modeling approach to evaluate the performance-related NFP impacts when mapping service governance to <b>technical</b> <b>solutions</b> using an ESB. This approach is illustrated by the quantitative performance analysis of a real world example, service governance from an Australian lending organization. ...|$|R
