It's going to go to zero in 2010. And then in 2011, it's going to go to 55 percent. And we have to make sure that the <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>that</b> went into effect, that that level remains. Otherwise, we're going to have one of the biggest tax increases in history in 2011. And I would look to try to regularize the rates and look for some marginal reduction, even beyond what we're doing right now.|$|E

Economist Jared Bernstein notes that it is mathematically impossible to fulfill all of these pledges, writing: [...] "Trump would need to cut spending outside the Social Security, Medicare, and defense by 114 percent to make his budget balance, which is, of course, impossible." [...] Bernstein, {{a senior fellow at the}} Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, stated a proposal “loses probably something in the neighborhood of $5 trillion in revenue over 10 years with regressive <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>that</b> exacerbate the inequalities that already exist in our economy.” [...] The fact-checking website PolitiFact similarly concluded: [...] "Trump's tax plan means either unprecedented spending cuts or increased federal borrowing.

Strickland cut another $540 million from the budget in September 2008. In December 2008, Strickland announced a $640 million budget gap. In 2009, Strickland halted {{the final year of}} a five-year income <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>that</b> had started in 2005.

However, a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>that</b> would adequately stave off a downturn needs to be substantially larger than that proposed by the president.

The test depends on the income distribution, extensive and intensive labor supply elasticities, and income effect parameters.

[...] His reaction to criticism was often severe, prompting his political enemies to derisively refer to him as [...] "Emperor Julian." [...] During the final year of Carroll's term, Lt. Gov.
