While coming to the same conclusion, they are {{convinced}} that Tipet is projecting himself into people's dreams and killing them there. Returning to the warehouse where they found Bormanis, Skinner and Doggett meet Tipet, who is trying to take his own life by pushing his head through a <b>table</b> <b>saw.</b> They rush him to the hospital, where Doggett by surprise finds Scully's name on the register. With Tipet in a coma, Kersh decides to pull the plug on the case, saying they've found the main suspect. But Doggett and Skinner are not satisfied, saying there are no explanations for the various murders and events surrounding the case.|$|E

25|$|Being {{much smaller}} than a normal <b>table</b> <b>saw,</b> they are {{substantially}} safer to use when cutting very small pieces. Using blades that have a smaller kerf (cutting width) than normal blades, there is less material lost {{and the possibility of}} kickback is reduced as well.|$|E
25|$|Mini and micro <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> have a blade {{diameter}} of 4 inches (100 mm) and under. Mini <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> are typically 4 inch, while micro <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> {{are less than}} 4 inch, although the naming of the saws is not well defined.|$|R

25|$|A <b>table</b> <b>saw</b> or {{sawbench}} is a woodworking tool, {{consisting of}} a circular saw blade, mounted on an arbor, that is driven by an electric motor (either directly, by belt, or by gears). The blade protrudes through {{the surface of a}} table, which provides support for the material, usually wood, being cut.|$|E
25|$|Mini and micro {{table saws}} are {{generally}} used by hobbyists and model builders, although the mini table saws (4 inch) have gained some popularity with building contractors that only need a small saw to cut small pieces (such as wood trim). Being {{a fraction of}} the size (and weight) of a normal <b>table</b> <b>saw,</b> they are much easier to carry and transport.|$|E
25|$|Benchtop {{table saws}} {{are the least}} {{expensive}} and least capable {{of the three major}} types; however, they can offer adequate capacity and precision for many tasks. The universal motor is not as durable or as quiet as an induction motor, but it offers more power relative to its size and weight. The top of a benchtop <b>table</b> <b>saw</b> is narrower than those of the contractors and cabinet saws, so the width of stock that can be ripped is reduced. Another restriction results from the top being smaller {{from the front of the}} tabletop to the rear. This results in a shorter rip fence, which makes it harder to make a clean, straight cut when ripping. Also, there is less distance from the front edge of the tabletop to the blade, which makes cross cutting stock using a mitre more difficult (the mitre and/or stock may not be fully supported by the table in front of the blade). Benchtop saws are the smallest type of <b>table</b> <b>saw</b> and have the least mass, potentially resulting in increased vibration during a cut.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Table</b> <b>saws</b> are {{the most}} {{dangerous}} woodworking tool. In the united States, 10 finger amputations by <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> occur every day. [...] The operator holds the wood, rather than the saw, {{making it easy to}} guide fingers into the saw, while guiding the wood.|$|R
50|$|While {{the blade}} sizes are {{interchangeable}} with <b>table</b> <b>saws,</b> a miter blade is optimized for short cuts {{across the grain}} of the wood with little pull, where as <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> are optimized for long rip cuts with the grain and pulling the material into the blade.|$|R

25|$|In {{a modern}} <b>table</b> <b>saw,</b> {{the depth of}} the cut is varied by moving the blade up and down: the higher the blade {{protrudes}} above the table, the deeper the cut that is made in the material. In some early table saws, the blade and arbor were fixed, and the table was moved up and down to expose more or less of the blade. The angle of cut is controlled by adjusting the angle of blade. Some earlier saws angled the table to control the cut angle.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} feather {{board was}} developed in 1990. The patented Grip-Tite is held to a cast iron table top or steel sub fence by high strength permanent magnets. The advantage of a magnetic feather board is the fast setup time on any cast iron tool deck or steel faced fence. When {{used in conjunction with}} a steel faced rip fence, they are used to hold down ripped wood on any saw deck and prevent kickback. Feed wheels added to the Grip-Tite base pull ripped wood to the fence, allowing the operator to rip wood on any <b>table</b> <b>saw</b> with no hands near the blade.|$|E
500|$|That the {{war would}} not last long beyond the {{election}} was clear {{in the final days}} of the 1918 congressional midterm election campaign, which was fought in part to decide which party would control the postwar peace process. [...] Wilson hoped for a treaty based on the Fourteen Points and had urged formation of a postwar organization to assure peace. Borah, well aware the U.S. would play a large role at the peace <b>table,</b> <b>saw</b> such an organization as a trap that would inevitably involve the U.S. whenever conflict developed in Europe. He decided to oppose Wilson's plan despite his personal admiration for the president.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Dual Spires enhanced" [...] video at the Psych website lists further {{references}} to Twin Peaks. Shawn's name for Gus in this episode is [...] "Lodge Blackmunn", a direct {{reference to the}} Black and White Lodge. Leo the Cinnamon Owl is a reference to Killer BOB, who possessed Leland Palmer and often {{took the form of}} an owl. The sheriff's deputy is Deputy Frost, named after Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost. The doctors of both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks have coconuts in their offices. Both Paula's and Laura's diaries described meetings with [...] "J". Sheriff Jackson tells Bob he needs to be strong for his wife. Dr Hayward says the same thing to Leland Palmer in Twin Peaks. Upon entering the town Gus mentions that the residents are looking {{at him as if he}} were the first black man they had ever seen. There are very few black men in Twin Peaks. When they enter the Sawmill Diner Bob Barker says [...] "Top of the morning to you." [...] In the first season of Twin Peaks, Pete Martell corrected Josie Packard on the saying. Maudette wears an orchid in her hair; Harold grew orchids in Twin Peaks. In the library Shawn asks if they can [...] "poke around" [...] but he and Gus immediately say [...] "peek" [...] in correction. Thus [...] "peek", as in Twin Peaks, is spoken twice. A man wearing a hat in the Sawmill Diner gives Shawn and Gus a thumbs up. The older room service attendant did the same thing to Agent Cooper in Twin Peaks. A record player is featured prominently in both the Barker and Palmer homes. The Roadhouse was also a location in Twin Peaks. Both Maudette and Audrey Horne love to dance. Paula's friend Jack is completely blind in one eye, referencing Twin Peaks' brothel named [...] "One Eyed Jacks". In the library Shawn and Gus find a book entitled [...] "Putt Your Way to a Better Future." [...] After Leland Palmer killed Maddy Ferguson he was seen putting golf balls around in his living room. When Randy is using the <b>table</b> <b>saw</b> it resembles the sawmill scene from the extended opening credits of Twin Peaks. When Maudette is placed in the body bag it is bent in such a way that it resembles a smile, like the smiling bag clue Agent Cooper found. On Maudette's desk beside her computer is a roll of green tape like the kind used by Leland Palmer to tie up Jacques Renault. In the cabin Bob Barker lights a match and holds it up like Leland Palmer did when describing BOB to Agent Cooper. Bob Barker wears a gold ring on his pinky, something Agent Cooper did in Twin Peaks. In the cabin the walls are red with red drapes as an allusion to the [...] "Red Room" [...] in Agent Cooper's dream.|$|E

2500|$|... : <b>Table</b> <b>saws</b> {{commonly}} have a fence (guide) {{running from}} the front of the table (the side nearest the operator) to the back, parallel to the cutting plane of the blade.

The fence is commonly called a [...] "rip fence" [...] referring to its use in guiding the workpiece during the process of making a rip cut. Most <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> come standard with a rip fence, but some high end saws are available without a fence so a fence of the user's choice can be purchased separately.|$|R
