Thereafter, his nickname was [...] "31-knot Burke," [...] originally a taunt, later a popular symbol of his hard-charging nature.In March 1944, Burke was promoted to Chief of Staff to the Commander of Task Force 58, the Fifth Fleet's Fast Carrier Task Force, which was commanded by Admiral Marc Mitscher. The transfer stemmed from a directive from the CNO, Admiral Ernest King, that required a surface commander such as Admiral Raymond A. Spruance to have an aviator as Chief of Staff, and an air commander, such as Mitscher, to have a surface officer as Chief of Staff. Neither Mitscher nor Burke were happy with the arrangement, but as time passed Burke realized he had been given {{one of the most important}} assignments in the Navy, and his hard work and diligence eventually warmed Mitscher to him. Burke was promoted to the temporary rank of Commodore, and participated in all the force's naval engagements until June 1945, near the end of the war. He was aboard both [...] and [...] when they were hit by Japanese kamikaze aircraft during the Okinawa campaign.|$|E
40|$|Abstract A silver- and zinc-containing zeolite matrix (AgION) {{used as a}} coating for {{stainless}} steel was tested for antimicrobial efficacy against Escherichia coli 25922, Staphylococcus aureus 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853, and Listeria monocytogenes 7644. Assays were performed on flat coupon surfaces and in formed steel cups. AgION reduced microbial colony-forming units when compared to uncoated steel surfaces under all conditions tested. Percent reductions ranged from 84. 536 to 99. 999 after 4 h exposure, and from 99. 992 to 100 after 24 h in all cases. The durability of the coatings declined most markedly when the coating had been applied with a wet process and scrubbed between uses with a test <b>tube</b> <b>brush.</b> Powder-coated surfaces cleaned with a towel re-tained {{a high degree of}} activity after five cycles of use...|$|E

40|$|The cuticular {{plate is}} {{a network of}} actin {{filaments}} found in hair cells of the cochlea. In the alligator lizard, it consists of rootlets, emanating from the stereocilia, and of cross-connecting actin filaments that anchor these rootlets. In thin sections, this network displays striking patches of 650 +/- 110 -A striae. By quantitative analyses of the images, {{the mystery of the}} striae can be explained. They are {{due in part to the}} rootlets which are sets of flat ribbons of actin filaments. The ribbons in each set are separated by approximately 650 A. Numerous whiskers 30 A in diameter extend from each ribbon's face, interconnecting adjacent ribbons. The nonrootlet filaments, except at the margins of the cell, occur primarily as single filaments. Like the ribbons, they are bristling with whiskers. The patches of striae are explained by ribbons and filaments held at a 650 -A separation by the whiskers that project from them. A simple model for regions of bewhiskered filaments is a box crammed full of randomly oriented test- <b>tube</b> <b>brushes.</b> A thin slice through the box will show regions of dark lines or striae due to the wire backbones of the brushes separated from one another by the bristle length. Using the computer instead of test- <b>tube</b> <b>brushes,</b> we have been able to model quantitatively the filament distribution and pattern of striae seen in the cuticular plate of the lizard. The organization of actin filaments we have deduced from our simulations differs from that found in macrophages or in the terminal web of intestinal epithelial cells...|$|R
50|$|During ovulation, the ovum travels {{down the}} Fallopian tubes to the uterus. These extend about 4 inch cm {{from both sides}} of the uterus. Finger-like {{projections}} at the ends of the <b>tubes</b> <b>brush</b> the ovaries and receive the ovum once it is released. The ovum then travels for three to four days to the uterus. After sexual intercourse, sperm swim up this funnel from the uterus. The lining of the tube and its secretions sustain the egg and the sperm, encouraging fertilization and nourishing the ovum until it reaches the uterus. If the ovum divides after fertilization, identical twins are produced. If separate eggs are fertilized by different sperm, the mother gives birth to non-identical or fraternal twins.|$|R
40|$|Marine {{fish farming}} is an {{important}} and growing industry. Fouling organisms that grow on the net cages and other structural components of the fish farms are a substantial problem for the industry. The overall {{aim of this study}} is to increase the understanding of how the bio fouling influence the hydrodynamic forces on the nets. More specifically the focus is on hydroid growth, and the use of models of net twine with artificial hydroid fouling. The models that were used ar made of two 1. 5 mm steel rods that are twisted together, with short pieces of 0. 32 mm multifilament fishing line fixed between them, similar to a test <b>tube</b> <b>brush.</b> The twisted steel rods were replicating a 3 mm twine, with the fishing lines acting as evenly distributed hydroid growth. Previously drag tests had been done with one and two of these models, with two parallel twines with variyng distance, and also a cross configuration. In the present study the goal was to investigate possible interaction effects between twines, by using various configurations with a higher number of twines; and also make small net sections and estimate the drag increase due to bio fouling. 16 twine models were made, and tests were done with a single twine; and 2, 4, 6 and 8 parallel twines; and also crossing twines, with the same numbers of twines in each direction. In total 18 different configurations were tested, with twine spacings of 12 mm and 24 mm. The experiments were done in a towing tank, with the twine models fixed in a frame, orthogonally to the direction of travel. The drag force was measured on the frame, and the contribution from the frame itself was subtracted from the total force to find the drag on the twine models. Then the drag coefficients were calculated and plotted in various diagrams to visualise any trends. All the configurations were tested at a range of velocities from 0. 05 m/s to 1. 4 m/s. Most of the results were consistent, except for the two lowest velocities (0. 05 m/s and 0. 1 m/s) were the precision error was significant. It was found that the drag coefficient for the fouled twine models were decreasing with increasing current velocity. At 0. 1 m/s (Re = 300) the drag coefficients were between 3. 5 and 4. 0, while for 1. 4 m/s (Re = 4200) they were approximately 3. 0. This is probably either because of deflection of the hydroids at higher velocities, or because the hydroids themselves have a smaller diameter, and hence are in a lower Reynolds number range (from Re = 32 to Re = 448), where the drag coefficient is dependent on the velocity. The variations in drag coefficients between the different model configurations were small, there were some consistent trends, but the magnitude were insignificant. This means that the interaction effects between the twines are relatively small, and it is likely that data from tests with few twines can be extrapolated to net panel applications. The drag coefficients for the net sections in the middle of the cruciform configurations were calculated. For the net sections with 12 mm spacing the results were inconclusive, while for 24 mm spacing the net drag coefficient varied between 0. 66 and 0. 59 for different velocities. This is twice as high as empirical data for a similar clean net. Several possibilities for further work were identified during the work with the thesis. One is to do more similar experiments, both with equivalent models to verify the results, and with either more or less hydroids, to study the influence of the amount of fouling. Another is to try to quantify the bending stiffness of real hydroids compared to the stiffness of the hydroid models (fishing line). The mechanical properties of real hydroids and the hydroid replicas have only been compared qualitatively in previous studies, so quantifying these would be useful both for validation of the models, and for improving them. Further investigations of the drag coefficient of the hydroid stems independently, with regards to the Reynolds number dependency of the drag coefficients of the whole models, would also be interesting...|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to ASTM C 672, XPP 18 - 420 (French Standard) (XPP 18 420 1995) was also used. This scaling test consisted of submerging test tubes of concrete in the NaCl solution for 24  h of 56 consecutive freeze–thaw cycles between + 20 and − 20  °C. For each measurement (after {{each of the}} first seven cycles as well as after the end of all 56 cycles), the test <b>tubes</b> were <b>brushed,</b> and the loosened particles were collected and washed. They were dried in a stove at a temperature of 105  ±  5  °C overnight and then weighed {{in order to determine the}} dried mass. The NaCl solution was then renewed, and the test tube was placed back inside. The cumulated mass of the particles detached from the test tube surface, called the scaling cumulated mass, was thus calculated according to the cycle number.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} {{procedure}} to achieve nanoscale mesoporous materials. Previously we have shown using hydrogen bonded amphiphiles that polymeric comb-coil supramolecules leading to lamellar-within -cylindrical assembly allow preparation of "hairy tubes", i. e. nanoscale empty <b>tubes</b> with polymer <b>brushes</b> at the wall. Here the concept is generalized: We use comb-coil supramolecules; with lamellar-within-lamellar structure based on coordination bonding. Polystyrene-block-poly(4 -vinylpyridine), PS-block-P 4 VP, is used with zinc dodecyl benzene sulphonate Zn(DBS) (2), which coordinates to the lone electron pair of pyridine nitrogen of the latter block. Due to the physical nature of coordination bonding part of supramolecular template can be removed after the structure is, formed by selective dissolution resulting in empty space between lamellae with polymer brushes at the walls...|$|R
40|$|Toothpaste {{retains its}} shape when stress is small, but flows when stress is {{sufficiently}} large. Thus, the toothpaste does not drip or spread {{under its own}} weight, but extrudes from a <b>tube</b> or <b>brushes</b> onto the teeth under a gentle force. The stress above which the toothpaste flows is called the yield stress. Such a fluid {{is known as a}} yield-stress fluid, a plastic fluid, or a viscoplastic fluid (Balmforth, Frigaard, Ovarlex 2014; Coussot 2014). Here we study plasticity in its purest form, using the rigid-plastic model. The model is a limit of the viscoplastic model, and is also a limit of the elastic-plastic, strain-hardening model. The rigid-plastic model characterizes a material using a single material constant, the yield stress. The model avoids complications associated with the flow, such as viscosity, elasticity, strain hardening, and thixotropy. Like linear viscosity and linear elasticity, the rigid-plastic model is among the most useful rheological models. The model describes toothpastes, greases, thermoplastic polymers, and metals (Hill 1950; Tanner 2000). In particular, the rigid-plastic model describes industrial processes of metals, such as extrusion, embossing and stamping. During these processes, plastic strain is much larger than elastic strain, so that elasticity is often negligible. For pre-strained metals, hardening is also often negligible. Rigid-plastic flows have been analyzed fo...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} polyurethane percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube degradation and the role played by fungi. The inner surfaces of 20 used polyurethane <b>tubes</b> were <b>brushed,</b> and the brushing end was incubated for 7 days in Saburaud broth and cultured if fungal growth occurred. Three tubes used for 12 (sample 12 w), 17 (sample 17 w), and 96 (sample 96 w) weeks and two new tubes were cut to produce several 4 -cm-long equal halves. Six samples from the new tubes were considered control samples (Co sample), seven were incubated in Saburaud broth (Co sample + Sa.), and seven in the broth supplemented with Candida albicans (Co sample + Sa. + Ca). All samples underwent morphological examination by electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry measurements (DSC). All tubes had fungal colonization. DSC showed deterioration in all tubes including the new ones; adding Candida albicans had no additional effects. Morphological examination by electron microscopy showed a regular pattern in the Co sample, and thick biofilm, holes, and crevices in samples 12 w, 17 w, and 96 w. The more the tubes had been used, the more severe were the changes. The Co sample + Sa and the Co sample + Sa + Ca showed no changes in the inner surface, but cryogenically fractured surfaces had holes and crevices. Yeasts constantly colonize PEG tubes and are likely to contribute to polyurethane deterioration. The impairment of new PEG tubes incubated in Saburaud broth suggests that other factors also play a role in polyurethane deterioration...|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} ("microlavage") {{was used to}} determine the volume of epithelial lining fluid recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage. A standard bronchial <b>brush</b> <b>tube</b> is used to lavage a peripheral lung subsegment rapidly with 20 ml of normal saline and the concentrations of urea and total protein are measured in the aspirated fluid. Using a very short dwell time for fluid (less than 20 seconds), this technique allows the urea dilution method to be used to quantify the epithelial lining fluid protein concentration, which is then used as an endogenous marker of the epithelial lining fluid in conventional bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The reproducibility of the calculation of the concentration of the lining fluid protein was assessed in 10 patients by performing the method in three separate lung subsegments. The mean coefficient of variation of the urea to protein ratio was 9. 0 %. A comparison of microlavage and conventional lavage was made in a further 28 patients. The differential cell counts were similar by the two methods, suggesting that similar epithelial lining fluid was sampled. The application of the microlavage technique to the calculation of epithelial lining fluid volume gave a lower value than the urea dilution method in association with conventional lavage. Microlavage should provide more accurate quantification of epithelial lining fluid volume and could be used in conjunction with conventional lavage, which is still required for an adequate harvest of alveolar cells...|$|R

40|$|In-furrow {{application}} of granular insecticides in corn {{is an effective}} way to provide root zone protection against insects such as corn root worm, wire worms, cutworms, white grubs and other harmful species. Traditional granular application methods consist of dispensing a uniform {{application of}} pesticide over {{the entire length of the}} furrow. A seed-specific granular pesticide application system was developed to decrease the volume of chemical used by metering pesticide into a modified seed tube fitted with a brush to hold granules in the seed tube. As a seed passes through the brush, granules are released and fall into the open furrow near the seed. Modifying seed <b>tubes</b> with a <b>brush</b> introduced the possibility of an effect on seed spacing. Effect of the seed tube modification on seed spacing was evaluated in laboratory and field trials. ^ Lab trials were performed using a stationary corn planter row unit. Variables tested were brushes (no, yes), granules (no, yes), seeds per second (8. 4, 20. 6), and tilt (no, 8 ° sidehill, 8 ° sidehill x 8 ° downhill). High speed video (1000 fps) recorded seed trajectory and the data was analyzed using multiple linear regression. Results showed while the brushes variable increased the standard deviation of horizontal seed velocity, vertical seed velocity, and seed speed, the combination of brushes and granules did not affect the standard deviation of horizontal seed velocity, vertical seed velocity, or seed speed. ^ Field trials consisted of 4 row plots, 30 m (100 ft) long, and replicated 3 times for a total of 12 rows for each variable. Data was recorded by measuring plant-toplant spacing. Data was then analyzed as a complete, unaltered, set and as an adjusted set with all data points 50 % above expected and 50 % below expected removed. Multiple linear regression was the analysis method of choice. Results showed that the brushes and granules combination did not affect seed spacing but did decrease standard deviation of seed spacing (full data set) and increase standard deviation of seed spacing (adjusted data set). ...|$|R
