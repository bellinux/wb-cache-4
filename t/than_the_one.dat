5|$|Skopje is {{a medium}} city at European level. Being {{the capital and}} largest city in the Republic of Macedonia, Skopje {{concentrates}} {{a large share of}} the national economy. The Skopje Statistical Region, which encompasses the City of Skopje and some neighbouring municipalities, produces 45,5% of the Macedonian GDP. In 2009, the regional GDP per capita amounted to USD 6,565, or 155% of the Macedonian GDP per capita. This figure is however smaller <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> of Sofia (USD 10,106), Sarajevo (USD 10,048) or Belgrade (USD 7,983), but higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> of Tirana (USD 4,126).|$|E
5|$|Besides these distributions, {{there are}} some {{independent}} operating systems based on FreeBSD. DragonFly BSD is a fork from FreeBSD 4.8 aiming for a different multiprocessor synchronization strategy <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> chosen for FreeBSD 5 and development of some microkernel features. It does not aim to stay compatible with FreeBSD and has huge differences in the kernel and basic userland. MidnightBSD is a fork of FreeBSD 6.1 borrowing heavily from NeXTSTEP, particularly in the user interface department.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, The New York Times {{reported}} that a sequel to Wall Street, to be subtitled Money Never Sleeps, was already in pre-production. Michael Douglas would reprise his role as Gordon Gekko.

5|$|Agnolín and Novas (2013) found Archaeopteryx and (possibly synonymous) Wellnhoferia {{to be the}} basalmost avialans (Avialae being {{defined by}} the authors as {{including}} Archaeopteryx lithographica and Passer, their most recent common ancestor {{and all of its}} descendants), with Microraptoria, Unenlagiinae, and the clade containing Anchiornis and Xiaotingia being successively closer outgroups to the Avialae. Another phylogenetic study by Godefroit, et al., using a more inclusive matrix <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> from the analysis in the description of Eosinopteryx brevipenna, also found Archaeopteryx {{to be a member of}} Avialae (defined by the authors as the most inclusive clade containing Passer domesticus, but not Dromaeosaurus albertensis or Troodon formosus). Archaeopteryx was found to form a grade at the base of Avialae with Xiaotingia, Anchiornis, and Aurornis. Compared to Archaeopteryx, Xiaotingia was found to be more closely related to extant birds, while both Anchiornis and Aurornis were found to be more distantly so.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature of Western Chalukya roof art {{is the use of}} domical ceilings (not {{to be confused with the}} European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|E
5|$|Capella A {{consists}} of two yellow evolved stars that have been calculated to orbit each other every 104 days with a separation of around 100 million km. The pair is a non-eclipsing binary—that is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes {{in front of the}} other. The orbit is known extremely accurately and can be used to derive an orbital parallax with far better precision <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> measured directly. The stars are not near enough to each other for the Roche lobe of either star to have been filled and any significant mass transfer to have taken place, even during the red giant stage of the primary star.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Roman {{soldiers}} seem to {{have been}} modelled after those of the Etruscans to the north, who themselves are believed to have copied their style of warfare from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> before it.|$|E
5|$|Each {{successive}} {{scene in}} the sequence was shorter <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> before it by exactly one frame. The scene where Bart writes his confession was done as one long take to balance the shorter scenes elsewhere in the episode. It was animated in the United States by Dan Haskett. There were a few problems with the finished animation for the episode. The banana in the opening scene was colored incorrectly, as the Korean animators were unfamiliar with the fruit, and the final bathtub scene was particularly problematic, including issues with lip sync. The version in the broadcast episode {{was the best of}} several attempts.|$|E
