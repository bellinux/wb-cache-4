5|$|As with zoneinfo, a user of Microsoft Windows configures DST by {{specifying the}} name of a location, and the {{operating}} system then consults a table of rule sets that must be updated when DST rules change. Procedures for specifying the name and updating the table vary with release. Updates are not issued for older versions of Microsoft Windows. Windows Vista supports at most two start and end rules per time zone setting. In a Canadian location observing DST, a single Vista setting supports both 1987–2006 and post-2006 <b>time</b> <b>stamps,</b> but mishandles some older <b>time</b> <b>stamps.</b> Older Microsoft Windows systems usually store only a single start and end rule for each zone, so that the same Canadian setting reliably supports only post-2006 <b>time</b> <b>stamps.</b>|$|E
5|$|These {{limitations}} {{have caused}} problems. For example, before 2005, DST in Israel varied {{each year and}} was skipped some years. Windows 95 used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In Windows 98, Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year. The 2005 Israeli Daylight Saving Law established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way. Partial workarounds, which mishandled older <b>time</b> <b>stamps,</b> included manually switching zone files every year and a Microsoft tool that switches zones automatically. In 2013, Israel standardized its daylight saving time according to the Gregorian calendar.|$|E

SpeedSearch provided full-text search of all SpeedScript documents on a disk, returning a count of how many times the searched word or phrase was used in each document.

40|$|Abstract. In this {{document}} a new <b>time</b> <b>stamping</b> system with linear chaining is presented. It has the characteristic {{that there is}} a symmetric situation between the computation of the <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> of a given document, and the control of its integrity. This is obtained through the use of of a new “baby step giant step ” algorithm that is introduced and applied. The equation for computing a <b>time</b> <b>stamp,</b> is a variable in the number of older timestamps used to compute the actual one. It is safer than the one used in other methods. It has also the characteristic that it establish a logarithmic link between any <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> in the cycle and the last one that is characteristic of the cycle. The availability is very high as no intermediate computations are required. The algorithm is named LILO as an abbreviation for linear logarithmic. From its properties it follows that the data for checking a <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> is logarithmic in volume and is independent of the position of the document in the cycle, whether it be for delivering a <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> or checking the integrity of a <b>time</b> <b>stamp.</b> Another characteristic of the system is that it has a detection and time localization of attempts to modify timestamps. A generalization using arbitrary arithmetic bases of integers is sketched. ...|$|R

In collecting data for finding costs, the time of beginning and completing operations is usually registered on cards by the workman himself in writing. The use of <b>time</b> <b>stamps</b> in the factory effects a considerable saving of time in this respect alone.|$|E
