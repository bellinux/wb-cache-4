After the 1970s it fell into decline until its final owner, Sheldon Adelson, {{made the decision to}} shut it down and to build a brand new resort.

5|$|The first {{manslaughter}} {{charge was}} in March 1888, when Abby H. Corner, a practitioner in Medford, Massachusetts, attended {{to her daughter}} during childbirth; the daughter bled to death and the baby did not survive. The defense argued {{that they might have}} died even with medical attention, and Corner was acquitted. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>dismay</b> of the Christian Scientists' Association (the secretary resigned), Eddy distanced herself from Corner, telling the Boston Globe that Corner had only attended the college for one term and had never entered the obstetrics class.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{dissatisfaction with}} McClellan's failure to {{reinforce}} Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dismay</b> {{of all in}} his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862.

5|$|During World WarI, the palace, {{then the}} home of King GeorgeV and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more {{valuable}} contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in situ. The King imposed rationing at the palace, much <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dismay</b> of his guests and household. To the King's later regret, David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol, to {{set a good example}} to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence. In 1938, the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory, was converted into a swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|Family feud: According to Zonaras, Odaenathus' nephew misbehaved {{during a}} lion hunt; {{he made the}} first attack and killed the animal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dismay</b> of the king.

5|$|Fearful of Hereford's power, Richard {{unjustly}} {{orders that}} his cousin be {{banished from the}} realm for six years, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dismay</b> of the House of Commons and many others. Slowly dying of old age, Gaunt's final advice to Richard, that he put aside his favourites and become a just king, falls on deaf ears.

In the wake of these troublesome events, Richard leaves England for Ireland, a decision widely considered folly considering the turmoil England is in.

40|$|A {{structural}} analysis of Ps 88 {{serves as a}} point of departure for a study of the poetics and especially the sound patterns and other stylistic figures that characterize the psalm. The ways in which sonic figures can serve to counter traumatic need in the psalm are discussed. The vocative expression in the opening line, 'Yhwh, God of my salvation!', already marks an important moment in this process. Because of the divine silence, dialogue does not take place. And yet, the situation is expressed via details of the psalm's structure, including the alternating sonic expressions of first and second person suffixes. Viewed as a whole, there is a progressive descent from <b>the</b> opening exclamation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dismayed</b> and powerlessly whispered conclusion in which 'a dark place' occupies the foreground...|$|R
5|$|In August 1979, {{the band}} entered Wessex Studios to begin {{recording}} London Calling. The Clash asked Guy Stevens {{to produce the}} album, much <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dismay</b> of CBS Records. Stevens had alcohol and drug problems and his production methods were unconventional. During a recording session he swung a ladder and upturned chairs – apparently to create a rock & roll atmosphere. The Clash, especially bassist Paul Simonon, got along well with Stevens, and found Stevens' work to be very helpful and productive to both Simonon's playing and their recording as a band. The album was recorded during a five- to six-week period involving 18-hour days, with many songs recorded {{in one or two}} takes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1988, he {{was put on the}} {{transfer}} list and came close to joining American club Portland Timbers, before injury put negotiations on hold. A £1million price tag also deterred a great deal of potential interest. In view of Whiteside's medical reports, Ferguson rejected bids of £500,000 from Osasuna of Spain and from Ron Atkinson's new club Sheffield Wednesday, before accepting a bid of £600,000 (with £150,000 to follow if Whiteside reached 50 games) from Everton in July 1989. This was <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dismay</b> of some of the club's supporters, who felt that there was still hope that he had a future at Old Trafford. Ferguson intended to build his own team having signed midfield duo Neil Webb and Mike Phelan, and also in the hunt for other players including Paul Ince, Gary Pallister and Danny Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the American embassy {{believed}} the Ngô family's {{claims that the}} regular army {{was responsible for the}} raids. The Voice of America, which was widely listened to in South Vietnam as the only non-Diệmist news source, initially aired Nhu's version of events, much <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dismay</b> of the generals. The American media thought otherwise and began to debunk this theory, pointing out that the Ngô family constantly sought to undermine the army, and that Madame Nhu's joy over the events suggested the family had neither ceded power nor had their hands forced by the military. Furthermore, they identified Nhu's aides at the site, his idiosyncratic style in the announcements supposedly made by the ARVN, {{and the fact that the}} army had little motive to attack the Buddhists.|$|E
50|$|Hindenburg wished <b>to</b> base <b>the</b> {{government}} on the parties of the right, but the right-wing German National People's Party (DNVP) refused to support Brüning's government. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> president's <b>dismay,</b> Brüning {{had to rely on}} his own Centre Party, the only party that fully supported him, and on the toleration of the Social Democrats.|$|R
50|$|Members of the CAA were {{hopeful that}} {{following}} World War II, when Western powers adopted new resolutions {{on the issue}} of colonialism, that they would encourage Third World independence under the trusteeship of <b>the</b> United Nations. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> CAA's <b>dismay,</b> <b>the</b> United States introduced a series of proposals at the April-May 1945 conference that set no clear limits on the length of colonialist occupation and no motions toward allowing territorial possessions to move toward self-government.|$|R

But, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Doctor's <b>dismay,</b> <b>the</b> Brigadier has converted the early, crude version of the antidote into a weapon, and uses it <b>to</b> destroy <b>the</b> remaining Cybermen.|$|R
