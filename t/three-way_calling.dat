40|$|In a {{multicast}} switching network, fanout {{is defined}} {{to be the}} number of outputs {{that need to be}} connected to an input. It is well known that fanout sets the complexity of a multicast switch. In the classic three-stage Clos architecture, fanout is reduced to be the number of output switches that need to be reached from an input. Again this number has a strong bearing on the complexity of the entire switch. In real applications, like teleconferencing, <b>three-way</b> <b>call,</b> etc., most multicast connections have small fanouts. But we must design the switch so that it can handle the worst case condition. To improve the efficiency we propose a fanout reduction scheme for the Clos network.

In first part this thesis, {{the development of a new}} architecture for multicast circuit switching network is presented. A fanout reduction is used in the new architecture to improve the efficiency of the Clos network. The new scheme reduces the complexity of the switch, and still maintain the general one-to-all multicast capability inside the switch. We demonstrate that even the better approach available for building a multicast network can be improved by this technique. The price we pay, however, is an increase in path setup time for connections with large fanouts. In the second part of the thesis, multicast packet switch architectures are studied. A fanout reduction scheme, similar to the scheme in the first part, for the multicast packet switch architecture is evaluated. This architecture required little extra cost to support multicast call, and the procedure of adding and deleting call parties is simple. The fanout reduction approach offers a new way of designing multicast interconnection networks...|$|R
50|$|Stored-program analog {{switches}} {{such as the}} 1ESS switch, {{had both}} simple wire junctors and circuit junctors. Circuit junctors were {{in the form of}} plug-in circuit boards to provide talk battery and supervision for intraoffice calls and were closely similar to intraoffice trunk packs, with two scan points and two signal distributor points per circuit, two circuits per plug-in pack. Wire junctors were two-wire connections between trunk nets and other trunk nets or line nets. When <b>three-way</b> <b>calling</b> was introduced, three-port conference trunks were used, which only appeared on trunk nets. All junctors appeared in subgroups of sixteen on plugs or jacks at the Junctor Grouping Frame, where as many subgroups as required were plugged into other trunk nets, line nets, or circuit junctor frames.|$|E
50|$|Local {{telephone}} wires terminate at {{the central}} office (telephone exchange), a structure containing the hardware needed to switch calls among local lines and long distance networks. Thus, when a call was placed by a customer outside the local calling area, the central office would switch the call to the respective long distance network. As technology advanced, central offices offered more services and their technical abilities improved. Services such as Caller ID, call return call-waiting, <b>three-way</b> <b>calling,</b> and voice-mail were first offered via central office-based technology although later PBXs also provided them. The role of the local phone company includes serving a given community and interfacing with the large long distance carriers. Prior to the advent of cell phones, most phone calls were made via landlines and local companies were thereby involved in some capacity in this communication. Deregulation and especially cell phones have reduced the need for local telephone services while Digital subscriber line Internet service and other services give local companies new roles in the telecommunications industry.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the kinds}} of data that can be moved over the 64 kbit/s {{channels}} are pulse-code modulated voice calls, providing access to the traditional voice PSTN. This information can be passed between the network and the user end-point at call set-up time. In North America, ISDN is now used mostly {{as an alternative to}} analog connections, most commonly for Internet access. Some of the services envisioned as being delivered over ISDN are now delivered over the Internet instead. In Europe, and in Germany in particular, ISDN has been successfully marketed as a phone with features, as opposed to a POTS phone with few or no features. Meanwhile, features that were first available with ISDN (such as <b>Three-Way</b> <b>Calling,</b> Call Forwarding, Caller ID, etc.) are now commonly available for ordinary analog phones as well, eliminating this advantage of ISDN. Another advantage of ISDN was the possibility of multiple simultaneous calls (one call per B channel), e.g. for big families, but with the increased popularity and reduced prices of mobile telephony this has become less interesting as well, making ISDN unappealing to the private customer. However, ISDN is typically more reliable than POTS, and has a significantly faster call setup time compared with POTS, and IP connections over ISDN typically have some 30-35ms round trip time, as opposed to 120-180ms (both measured with otherwise unused lines) over 56k or V.34/V.92 modems, making ISDN more reliable and more efficient for telecommuters.|$|E
50|$|The more {{expensive}} cymbal pads can swing freely after being hit (only {{rotation of the}} pad is prevented by a special cymbal mount), so they feel more like real cymbals, while the less expensive cymbal pads are not movable and always stay in their fixed position, thus feeling less realistic.

40|$|A {{feature in}} the context of a service-oriented {{software}} system is a program module that is added to a basic service in order to add functionality. An example of this type of system is the telephone system, where customers can subscribe to add-on telephony features such as Call Waiting, <b>Three-Way</b> <b>Calling,</b> and Call Number Display. An inherent problem of such a system is the feature interaction problem. A new feature interacts with an existing feature if the behavior of the existing feature is changed by the presence of the new feature. This thesis describes an approach to detecting feature interactions during the requirements phase of feature development. The approach involves specifying features {{in the context of}} a layered state-transition machine model that prioritizes features and avoids interactions due to non-determinism.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of a three-way data set using three-mode principal components analysis yields component matrices for all three modes of the data, and a <b>three-way</b> array <b>called</b> the core, which relates the components for the different modes to each other. To exploit rotational freedom in the model, one may rotate the core array (over all three modes) to an optimally simple form, for instance by three-mode orthomax rotation. However, such a rotation of the core may inadvertently detract from {{the simplicity of the}} component matrices. One remedy is to rotate the core only over those modes in which no simple solution for the component matrices is desired or available, but this approach may in turn reduce the simplicity of the core to an unacceptable extent. In the present paper, a general approach is developed, in which a criterion is optimized that not only takes into account the simplicity of the core, but also, to any desired degree, the simplicity of the component matrices. This method (in contrast to methods for either core or component matrix rotation) can be used to find solutions in which the core and the component matrices are all reasonably simple...|$|R
