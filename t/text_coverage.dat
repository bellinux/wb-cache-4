50|$|Researchers have {{expressed}} {{doubts about the}} adequacy of the GSL because of its age and the relatively low coverage provided by the words not in the first 1,000 words of the list. Engels was, in particular, critical of the limited vocabulary chosen by West (1953), and while he concurred that the first 1,000 words of the GSL were good selections based on their high frequency and wide range, he was of the opinion that the words beyond the first 1,000 of the GSL could not be considered general service words because the range and frequency of these words were too low {{to be included in the}} list. Recent research by Billuroğlu and Neufeld (2005) confirmed that the General Service List was in need of minor revision, but the headwords in the list still provide approximately 80% <b>text</b> <b>coverage</b> in written English. The research showed that the GSL contains a small number of archaic terms, such as shilling, while excluding words that have gained currency since the first half of the twentieth century, such as plastic, television, battery, okay, victim, and drug.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the use of}} "text {{coverage}} " {{to measure}} the intelligibility of reading materials is increasing {{in the field of}} vocabulary teaching and learning, to date there have been few studies which address the methodological variables that can affect reliable <b>text</b> <b>coverage</b> calculations.

40|$|Although {{many studies}} have used “text coverage”to measure the {{intelligibility}} of word lists and second language learning material, to date, {{there have been few}} studies which address the methodological variables that can affect reliable <b>text</b> <b>coverage</b> calculations. The present study addresses this issue by applying empirical analyses (distribution of mean score and standard deviation) to <b>text</b> <b>coverage</b> samples using variations of text length (both with and without proper nouns),vocabulary size and sample size in order to determine how these variables might affect the calculation of <b>text</b> <b>coverage.</b> In building on the previous studies of Chujo and Utiyama(2005 a; 2005 b),text coverage was examined by using twenty-six different text lengths taken from the Time Almanac corpus(both with and without proper nouns),twenty-two lists of graded vocabulary ranges taken from high frequency words of the British National Corpus, and ten different sample sizes in 1, 000 iterations. The results of the study clearly demonstrate that <b>text</b> <b>coverage</b> is more stable when the text length is longer,when more samples are used,and when proper nouns are excluded. When proper nouns were retained,the coverage figures were 7. 9 % on average less than when they were excluded. As a practical guideline for educators,tables showing minimum parameters (both with and without proper nouns) are included for reference in computing <b>text</b> <b>coverage</b> calculations...|$|E
40|$|The inextricable {{link between}} {{vocabulary}} knowledge and reading comprehension is incontrovertible. However, questions remain regarding {{the nature of}} the interaction. One question which remains unresolved is whether there is an optimum <b>text</b> <b>coverage,</b> or ratio of known to unknown words in a text, such that any deleterious effects of the unknown words on reading comprehension are minimised. A related question is what vocabulary size would a reader need to have in order to achieve the optimum <b>text</b> <b>coverage</b> for a given text or class of texts. This thesis addresses these questions in three ways. First, a replication and expansion of a key study (Hu & Nation, 2000) 1 was performed. In that study, 98 % <b>text</b> <b>coverage</b> was found to be optimal for adequate reading comprehension of short fiction texts when reading for pleasure. To replicate that study, equivalent measures of reading comprehension were collected from a more homogeneous group of participants at a university in northern Thailand (n = 138), under stricter conditions and random assignment to one of three <b>text</b> <b>coverage</b> conditions, to verify the generalisability of the results. The original study was also expanded by measuring reader characteristics thought to contribute to reading comprehension, such as vocabulary size, l 1 and l 2 literacy, and reading attitudes, in an effort to improve the explainable reading comprehension variance. In order to more accurately calculate the <b>text</b> <b>coverage</b> a reader experiences for a particular text, both the vocabulary profile of the text and the vocabulary size of the reader must be known as precisely as possible. Therefore, to contribute to the question of vocabulary size, changes such as measuring item completion time and varying the order of item presentation were made to the VST (P. Nation & Beglar, 2007) to improve its sensitivity and accuracy. This may ultimately lead to increased precision when using <b>text</b> <b>coverage</b> to predict reading comprehension. Finally, l 2 English vocabulary size norms were established to supplement the diagnostic usefulness of the VST. Data were collected through an online version of the VST created for this thesis from primarily self-selected participants (n 1 : 31 105) located in countries (n 100) around the world representing several l 1 and age groups. Analysis of the data collected for this thesis suggest that <b>text</b> <b>coverage</b> explains much less reading comprehension variance than previously reported while vocabulary size may be a more powerful predictor. An internal replication of Hu and Nation (2000) found errors in the calculation of optimum <b>text</b> <b>coverage</b> and in the reported size of the effect on reading comprehension. A critical review of the theoretical foundations of the <b>text</b> <b>coverage</b> model of reading comprehension found serious flaws in construct operationalisation and research design. Due to these flaws, most research which has purported to measure the effect of <b>text</b> <b>coverage</b> on reading comprehension actually measured the effect of an intervening variable: readers’ vocabulary size. Vocabulary size norms derived from data collected through an online version of the VST appear to be reliable and representative. Varying item presentation order appears to increase test sensitivity. Despite a moderate effect for l 1 English users, item completion time does not seem to account for any variance in vocabulary size scores for l 2 English learners. Based on the finding that vocabulary size may explain both reading comprehension and <b>text</b> <b>coverage,</b> the putative power of <b>text</b> <b>coverage</b> to predict reading comprehension is challenged. However, an alternative measure which may offer greater power to predict reading comprehension, the VST, has been modified and made available online. This version of the VST may provide greater sensitivity and ease of use than the offline, paper-based version...|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{models of}} parsing {{as used in}} {{interfaces}} have shown to be weak and ineffective in complex tasks such as processing of naturally-occurring <b>texts.</b> Broad <b>coverage</b> parsers go mad when confronted with extended inputs without sufficient information to control the interpretation process.

Extra-linguistic criteria (e. g. statistics, semantic or goal-driven heuristics) can be employed to reduce the combinatorics of parsing and to avoid misdirected efforts, focusing the analysis on the most promising solutions.
