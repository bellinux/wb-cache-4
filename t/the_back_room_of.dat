5|$|Joseph Merrick, the Elephant Man, {{moved to}} Whitechapel Road in 1884. Visitors paid {{to see him}} in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> a shop owned by showman Tom Norman. The shop was {{directly}} opposite the Royal London Hospital, and Merrick was frequently visited by doctors. Merrick later moved to the hospital permanently, where he spent the last years of his life.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the exterior scenes taking place in New Jersey were filmed on location, with the {{majority of}} the interior shots—including most indoor shots of the Soprano residence, <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the strip club Bada Bing!, and Dr. Melfi's psychiatrist's office—filmed at Silvercup Studios in New York City.|$|E
5|$|He {{established}} his practice in Lower Manhattan in general surgery and medicine, treating {{both black and}} white patients. He started a school in the evenings, teaching children. He established what has been called the first black-owned and operated pharmacy in the United States, located at 93 West Broadway (near present-day Foley Square). His friends and activists gathered in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the pharmacy to discuss issues related to their work in abolitionism.|$|E
50|$|In {{its very}} early days, the Tammany Society met in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> various taverns, {{most often in}} Barden's Tavern on Broadway near Bowling Green. These <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> served as {{unofficial}} campaign headquarters on election days.|$|R
50|$|Jessie: Niles's son, a {{computer}} hacker, {{and almost as}} good with machines as his dad. Jessie survives using his craftiness, as evidenced in their idea to hide out from the original slaughter in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forsetti Station's theatre. He is voiced by Jason Marsden.|$|R
50|$|The Bing {{is owned}} and chiefly {{operated}} by Silvio Dante, Tony Soprano's consigliere, in Lodi, New Jersey.

5|$|That year, {{the couple}} decided {{to open up}} an occult store, named The Warlock Shop, at 300 Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights, New York City; {{alongside}} this venture, they also founded a company, Earth Religion Supplies, Inc, which would later go into publishing. Officially opening on June 21, 1972, <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the shop would {{also be used for}} weekly lectures and would be rented to various occult groups who wanted to assemble there.|$|E
5|$|The Minoan Brotherhood {{was officially}} inaugurated on January 1, 1977. Naming this first group the Knossos Grove coven, it {{initially}} began at his and Geraci's shared flat, {{where they were}} joined by their friend Joseph Cupolo. Setting up a lineage recording system to take into account which new initiates were being brought into the Brotherhood, the first man to be welcomed in was Kim Schuller, who was soon followed by Bruce-Michael Gelbert. Not long after, Cupolo moved to New Orleans, where he founded a second coven, known as Phaistos Grove. In 1977, Buczynski began attending the Sheridan Square Gym, and it was here that he met Gene Muto the following year. A stage director and part-time bartender, Muto entered into a sexual relationship with Buczynski, which Geraci accepted as per the rules of their open relationship. However, when Buczynski announced that he {{had fallen in love with}} Muto, it marked the end of his relationship with Geraci, who decided to move back to New Orleans in February 1979. Muto proceeded to move in with Buczynski at his apartment on West 13th Street, but did not share his boyfriend's magico-religious beliefs, instead being a far left atheist. He felt that Buczynski was wasting his life on Witchcraft, and encouraged him to aim for an academic education; Buczynski proceeded to attain a graduate equivalency diploma (GED). The Knossos Grove had meanwhile begun to deteriorate, rarely meeting from late-1978 through early 1979. He did however bring in Tony Fiara in late 1979, who would go on to play a significant role in the Minoan tradition, which was then being eclipsed in size by the Radical Faerie movement. That year, Buczynski decided to stop using his flat as a covenstead, which he moved to the Earth Star Temple, <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> The Magickal Childe, Herman Slater's new shop.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the temple, the opisthodomos, usually {{served as}} a storage space for cult equipment. It could also hold the temple treasury. For some time, the opisthodomus of the Athenian Parthenon {{contained}} the treasury of the Delian League, thus directly protected by the deity. Pronaos and opisthodomos were often closed off from the peristasis by wooden barriers or fences.|$|E

50|$|Segni {{was also}} a {{professor}} of law at University of Sassari. Straightforward, witty and courteous, Segni was more at ease in the classroom or the law court than in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> Italian politics. He died on 1 December 1972, in Rome. The frail, often ailing Segni, was affectionately called malato di ferro—"the invalid with the iron constitution".|$|R
25|$|Lee {{was the son}} of Chinese immigrants. He {{was born}} in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the family's laundry on Carondelet Street, in the part of New Orleans known as Central City. When they were old enough, he and his siblings, {{eventually}} numbering eight, were given jobs in the laundry and later in the family's restaurants, including the House of Lee in Metairie.|$|E
25|$|Interior {{scenes were}} {{initially}} {{supposed to be}} filmed at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, but to simplify cross-country logistics, {{the decision was made}} to use the facilities of Greenwich Studios in North Miami instead, and only carry out post-production in L.A. In a few scenes particularly in earlier episodes, Greenwich Studios' rear loading dock is repeatedly portrayed as <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the Gold Coast Shipping building, where the offices of the vice squad are located.|$|E
25|$|The pair leave, {{and walk}} along the streets taking turns {{carrying}} the disguises and discussing how to split the money. This serves to introduce some levity and ease the narrative out of the emotional climax of the scene, helping to prepare the audience for the twists and emotion of the following scene, the true climax of the play. Tamashima Ittō is invited into <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the shop for a drink, perhaps in part in thanks for pointing out the thieves.|$|E
5000|$|Early Ohio Republicans such as Salmon P. Chase staffed many {{important}} national offices. Chase coined the phrase [...] "Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men". Starting in the 1880s, Ohio's Marcus A. Hanna {{was a significant}} power in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national Republican party. In the 1890s, Hanna led the conservative {{wing of the party}} against Theodore Roosevelt's progressive movement.|$|R

50|$|Although destined {{by birth}} to a {{secondary}} role, Contarini took naturally to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> power, and proved just as adept at attending the Senate of Venice as {{he might have been}} as a Senator. Nor was his public life totally non-existent: {{he was elected to the}} Council of Ten, even serving as savio of the Council, and in March 1655, he served as Vice-Doge for the period between the death of Doge Francesco Molin and the election of Carlo Contarini.|$|R
25|$|The OBPA holds {{a breakfast}} event every Wednesday at a Denny's {{restaurant}} in Oceanside, California. The breakfast starts at 8 am although members start showing up {{as early as}} 6:30 am to get {{a head start on}} the festivities. The group occupies <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the restaurant which is decorated with model aircraft hanging from the ceiling and photos of aircraft and pilots lining the walls. Attendees come from communities throughout southern California. Less frequent are visitors from around the world including Germany, Australia, Hungary and South Africa. Some come for the camaraderie while others find relief discussing the rigors of combat with people who have had similar experiences.|$|E
25|$|In 1837, Echeverría {{founded the}} Asociación de Mayo, at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> his store. The meeting was first viewed favorably by top functionaries of the Rosas government, {{even though they}} were {{considered}} suspicious by the Sociedad Popular Restauradora (Rosas' government's political arm). In the same year, the French blockade of the Río de la Plata started, which first for cultural reasons, then political, defined them as anti-Rosas. The threats of the para-military group, the Mazorca, Sastre did not flee to Montevideo, as several of his friends had done. The government's displeasure and the stopping of imports from France caused the bankruptcy of his bookstore. In 1840, Sastre published a novel, Cartas a Germania.|$|E
25|$|On 14 December 1999, former Beatle Paul McCartney {{returned}} to the New Cavern Club stage to play his last gig of 1999 publicising his new album, Run Devil Run. It has around 40 live bands performing every week; both tribute and original bands, although most perform their own material. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the Cavern is {{the most frequently used}} location for touring acts and ticketed events, in more recent times playing host to The Wanted, Adele and Jessie J. The Cavern is also used as a tour warm-up venue with semi-secret gigs announced at the last moment. The Arctic Monkeys did this in October 2005, Jake Bugg in November 2013, as well as many others before them, such as Travis and Oasis.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1830s, the Paris police counted 271 wandering street musicians, 220 saltimbanques, 106 players of the barbary organ, and 135 itinerant street singers. The goguettes , or working class singing-clubs, continued to grow in the popularity, meeting in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> cabarets. <b>The</b> repertoire of popular songs ranged from romantic to comic and satirical, to political and revolutionary, especially in the 1840s. in June, 1848, the musical clubs were banned from meeting, as the government tried, without success, to stop the political unrest, which finally exploded into the 1848 French Revolution.|$|R
60|$|He {{proceeded}} {{to draw a}} picture of the alternative--himself living like a fangless lion about <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> a house in which his stepdaughter was mistress, an inoffensive old man, tenderly smiled on by Elizabeth, and good-naturedly tolerated by her husband. It was terrible to his pride to think of descending so low; and yet, for the girl's sake he might put up with anything; even from Farfrae; even snubbings and masterful tongue-scourgings. The privilege of being in the house she occupied would almost outweigh the personal humiliation.|$|R

25|$|Giosue's elder brother, Gennaro Gallucci, {{was shot}} dead on November 14, 1909, in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the family bakery. The assassin entered the bakery and yelled for Gennaro. When he appeared, he {{was shot and killed}} immediately. His {{activities}} as a collector of protection payments had caught the attention of the authorities earlier, and he had to leave New York City for a while. Gennaro arrived in New York from Italy in December 1908, having escaped from prison after serving 23 years of a life sentence for murdering two men. He lived on East 109th Street with his brother, Giosuè, and sister-in-law, Assunta. Soon after his arrival, the police began receiving complaints about extortion practices, but when the plaintiffs were told that they had to confront him in court, they dropped the charges.|$|E
25|$|Bogan {{was placed}} in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> a local saloon, as there was no jail at the time, but before his shotgun wound had healed, {{the next day in}} fact, he took {{advantage}} of the poor security and made an escape during a roaring blizzard. Owens, knowing that Bogan was badly wounded, believed he could not go far. He was right, as two weeks later Bogan, burning up with fever and with his wound infected, sent word to Owens that he wished to surrender and receive medical attention. Bogan met with Owens sixteen miles outside of Lusk, and voiced to Owens that he feared a lynch mob would be waiting for him when they reached Lusk, as Gunn was extremely well liked and respected in the town. As they entered town, Owens backed down a mob that was intent on hanging Bogan, then Owens shackled Bogan {{in the back of the}} Sweeney Saloon. The next day, Owens left with Bogan en route to Cheyenne, Wyoming, and by February 4 he had him secured in the Laramie County jail.|$|E
25|$|In 1952 Alberto Ruz Lhuillier {{removed a}} stone slab {{in the floor}} of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the temple {{superstructure}} to reveal a passageway (filled in shortly before the city's abandonment and reopened by archeologists) leading through a long stairway to Pakal's tomb. The tomb itself is remarkable for its large carved sarcophagus, the rich ornaments accompanying Pakal, and for the stucco sculpture decorating {{the walls of the}} tomb. Unique to Pakal's tomb is the psychoduct, which leads from the tomb itself, up the stairway and {{through a hole in the}} stone covering the entrance to the burial. This psychoduct is perhaps a physical reference to concepts about the departure of the soul at the time of death in Maya eschatology where in the inscriptions the phrase ochb'ihaj sak ik'il (the white breath road-entered) is used to refer to the leaving of the soul. A find such as this is greatly important because it demonstrated for the first time the temple usage as being multifaceted. These pyramids were, for the first time, identified as temples and also funerary structures.|$|E

5000|$|O'Brien said: [...] "I {{guess it}} was my curiosity that drove my {{attraction}} to political journalism—and drove my desire to work for Gough Whitlam when that opportunity came up—because I {{wanted to see what}} it was like behind the scenes.

When I came back to journalism, I realised that the experience I'd had in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> politics was like gold for me—in terms of being able to understand and second guess what was really going on behind that sort of opaque screen that the political processes, the processes of government throw up." ...|$|R

It discharged when the hammer hit the floor. [...] "The ball passed through his coat, struck the north wall then glanced off and passed out through the ceiling." [...] Wyatt was so red-faced by the incident that years later, he persuaded biographer Stuart Lake to omit it from his book Wyatt Earp, Frontier Marshal.|$|E
500|$|The gunfight started during court {{proceedings}} in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> a saloon.

An inquest on both men, {{held in the}} saloon, found that the bodies each contained bullet wounds from the [...]41 caliber revolvers that were used, and powder burns caused by {{the proximity of the}} shootout. Truby also had [...]45 caliber bullet wounds in his back, indicating that somebody else had shot him during the shootout.|$|E

Elijah brings David to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> his studio, extends his hand, and asks David to shake it. Upon doing so, David sees visions of Elijah orchestrating several terrorist disasters, including David's recent train accident, causing hundreds of deaths. David is horrified, but Elijah insists the deaths were justified {{as a means to}} find him. Calling himself [...] "Mr. Glass", a nickname his peers had used to taunt him with when he was growing up, he explains that his own purpose in life is to be the villain to David's hero.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the gift basket shop Sinito opened in Beachwood, Ohio, he also co-owned the Appliance Mart with his brother Chuck. The Appliance Mart was a business front for the Cleveland family. The mart, which opened in 1972, had two locations, one in Euclid, Ohio {{and the other in}} Bedford, Ohio on Northfield Road. The Bedford store soon became a major base of operations for Sinito, from which he regularly met with Lonardo and other mobsters, discussed various illegal activities, short term as well as long term criminal plots, schemes and scams, and operated various illegal activities. Detailed plans for drug trafficking, conspiracies to kill police informers and other violent measures were conceived and acted on from meetings in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> Appliance Mart.|$|R
