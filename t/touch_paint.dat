5000|$|This small {{church is}} {{in a distant}} corner of Venice; it {{is best known for}} the painted organ doors {{depicting}} the Story of Tobias, attributed to the late 18th century vedutista Gianantonio Guardi. While Guardi is also known for his misty lagoon vistas of Venice, in this religious painting the scene explodes with scintillating brushstrokes. It is a parting demonstration that the Venetian school still had a flash of originality. The [...] (<b>touch</b> <b>painting)</b> world of these paintings exists in a world where clouds and bodies are feathered with color. A last firework of paint dabbed just a few decades before the real blasts of Napoleonic grapeshot were heard by the last Doge.|$|R

50|$|The {{scope of}} Rozentāls' {{activities}} was very wide, but painting was of paramount importance. He revealed {{the beauty of}} nature, demonstrated the integrity of man and nature. In Rozentāls' works the linear coexisted with the picturesque, flatness - with a soft transition of tones, small <b>touches</b> of <b>paint</b> - with wast surfaces of color. The main trait of his compositions was asymmetry, the wavelike rhythm of Art Nouveau.|$|R

60|$|A {{call for}} the {{competitors}} now drew the Quartermaster and his adversary away, {{and in a few}} moments the second trial of skill commenced. A common wrought nail was driven lightly into the target, its head having been first <b>touched</b> with <b>paint,</b> and the marksman was required to hit it, or he lost his chances in the succeeding trials. No one was permitted to enter, on this occasion, who had already failed in the essay against the bull's-eye.|$|R
40|$|The {{transverse}} {{and persistent}} mechanisms of de-valuation and containment of women’s irony and humor, especially {{in terms of}} literary representation, has triggered some dynamics of exclusion and/or hierarchical inclusion in the cultural system of the humorous literary products by women writers. This paper intends to let emerge, from the “galassia sommersa" (Arslan) of the Italian women literature, Marchesa Colombi’s novel Matrimonio in provincia (1885), exactly in the light of its fundamental humorous nature, so rare in the Italian women's fiction, especially in a historical tranche (the end of the XIXth century) where women writers, through decadent and realistic <b>touches,</b> <b>paint</b> fictional universes oppressed by patriarchal value systems, in relation to which the mild forms of women characters’ resistance are represented by suicidal acts or sad resignation to an unwanted fate. On the contrary, the witty and sarcastic tone of Marchesa Colombi’s writing, its bitter and disturbing sense of humour, which attacks the reality and causes its grotesque reversal, is able to change so transgressively the canonical narrative system that the clichés of the traditional romantic literature are demolished and the symbolic and material representations of women in the collective unconscious are strongly questioned...|$|R

They had nothing {{much to talk about}} but themselves, and, while she received a liberal education concerning Arctic travel and gold-mining, he, in turn, <b>touch</b> by <b>touch,</b> <b>painted</b> an ever clearer portrait of her. She amplified the ranch life of her girlhood, prattling on about horses and dogs and persons and things until {{it was as if he}} saw the whole process of her growth and her becoming. All this he was able to trace on through the period of her father's failure and death, when she had been compelled to leave the university and go into office work. The brother, too, she spoke of, and of her long struggle to have him cured and of her now fading hopes. Daylight decided that it was easier to come to an understanding of her than he had anticipated, though he was always aware that behind and under all he knew of her was the mysterious and baffling woman and sex. There, he was humble enough to confess to himself, was a chartless, shoreless sea, about which he knew nothing and which he must nevertheless somehow navigate.|$|R

60|$|In {{spite of}} his natural effrontery, the envoy of the Wild Boar of Ardennes now became pale; and that {{notwithstanding}} some <b>touches</b> of <b>paint</b> with which he had adorned his countenance. Toison d'Or, the chief herald, as we have elsewhere said, of the Duke, and King at arms within his dominions, stepped forward with the solemnity of one who knew what was due to his office, and asked his supposed brother in what college he had studied the science which he professed.|$|R

The bullet passed directly through the centre of the bull's-eye, much the best shot of the morning, since the others had merely <b>touched</b> the <b>paint.</b>|$|R

It was that of the Empress, but oh! so changed by jealous rage that I should scarce have known her. The large eyes seemed to flash fire, the cheeks were white, save where they had been <b>touched</b> with <b>paint,</b> the lips trembled. Twice she tried to speak and failed, but at the third effort words came.|$|R
25|$|Initial {{suspicion}} that the oils might be attributable to contamination from fingers, as the <b>touching</b> of the <b>painting</b> is encouraged in Buddhist tradition, was dispelled by spectroscopy and chromatography giving an unambiguous signal for the intentional use of drying oils rather than contaminants.

50|$|Bare mud-and-tape drywall is {{generally}} only acceptable {{as a final}} decorating finish in utility spaces such as attics or garages. In most rooms, such walls are finished with paint or wallpaper. Plaster veneer walls are usually similarly decorated, but unpainted plaster can {{also serve as a}} finish. Because bare plaster can be appealing to the <b>touch,</b> and <b>paint</b> would add an additional layer, some decorators opt to leave exposed plaster in some or all of a room, as a creative choice. In such cases, if the plaster's natural color is not desired, tints can be added as part of the mixing process, or can be introduced unevenly for artistic color effects.|$|R
40|$|Ahaptic {{interface}} {{lets the}} user <b>touch,</b> explore, <b>paint,</b> and manipulate virtual 3 D models {{in a natural}} way using a haptic display device. A haptic rendering algorithm must generate a force field to simulate {{the presence of these}} virtual objects and their surface properties (such as friction and texture), or to guide the user along a specific trajectory. We can roughly classify haptic rendering algorithms according to the surface representation they use: geometric haptic algorithms for surface data, 1, 2 and volumetric haptic algorithms based on volumetric data 3 including implicit surface representation. 4 A novel haptic rendering technique using a hybrid surface representation addresses conventional limitations in haptic displays. ...|$|R

By degrees, however, the place resolved itself into a bare and dirty room, with a couple of windows, whereof a tenth part might be of glass, the remainder being stopped up with old copy-books and paper. There were a couple of long old rickety desks, cut and notched, and inked, and damaged, in every possible way; two or three forms; a detached desk for Squeers; and another for his assistant. The ceiling was supported, like that of a barn, by cross-beams and rafters; and the walls were so stained and discoloured, {{that it was impossible to}} tell whether they had ever been <b>touched</b> with <b>paint</b> or whitewash.|$|R
