2500|$|Impressed by the {{reasoning}} {{and character of}} these men, Earle and Barbara joined the Society of Friends (Quakers) and considered taking over their protest in the Phoenix. Dr. Reynolds, {{an expert on the}} dangers of radiation, was concerned about the effect of this additional radiation on the world environment. Mikami, as a citizen of Hiroshima, said in effect that his desire to be included on such a trip was a [...] "no brainer." [...] The family spent days in research, thought and prayer and on June 11, 1958, the Phoenix cleared from Honolulu [...] "for the high seas." [...] On July 1, {{at the edge of the}} invisible perimeter of the zone, Reynolds announced by radiotelephone, on the international frequency for ships at sea, [...] "The United States yacht Phoenix is sailing today into the nuclear <b>test</b> <b>zone</b> as a protest against nuclear testing..." [...] The Phoenix became the first vessel to enter a nuclear <b>test</b> <b>zone</b> in protest when they sailed into the test area at Bikini Atoll. (Years later, in private correspondence, Captain Bigelow wrote Earle that most people had never heard of the Phoenix and thought the [...] Golden Rule had sailed into the area.) They were intercepted [...] inside the forbidden area by an American Coast Guard vessel, the Planetree, whose armed officers boarded the yacht and put Dr. Reynolds under arrest. They ordered him to sail the Phoenix to Kwajalein, escorted by the Navy destroyer Collett and from there they flew him, with Barbara and Jessica, back to Honolulu for trial.|$|E

This voyage included a number of local kiwi peace organisations who had organised an international flotilla of protest yachts that accompanied the frigates into the Mururoa zone. Many of the early NZ peace activists and organisations were enthusiastic young hippies and students, many of whom were involved with the counter-culture and the original opposition to the Vietnam War movements.|$|E

40|$|The {{availability}} of IKONOS stereo pairs {{has made it}} possible to generate Digital Surface Models of IKONOS data. Though it is possible to obtain a DSM from two images with a different viewing angle on the same area, it is preferred to work with products ordered as stereo. Such stereo pairs have images that are made in the same orbital pass, resulting in a much better geometry of the stereo model. In this paper the accuracy of an IKONOS derived DSM of urban areas is assessed, based on DSMs from aerial photography and laser scanning. The quality and accuracy of a DSM derived from IKONOS stereo pairs has been assessed for <b>test</b> <b>zones</b> in two cities, Ghent and Liege. The <b>test</b> <b>zones</b> are characterized by a typical urban morphology (city center, residential, industry). The accuracy has been assessed for each of the different types of urban morphology in the study areas. An error surface is obtained by calculating the difference between the generated IKONOS surface models and reference surface models. This surface is used as a measure for the accuracy of the IKONOS surface model. Reference surface models from different origins are used (aerial photography, lidar, large scale 3 D database). For the <b>test</b> <b>zones</b> in Liege, the relation between the DSM accuracy and different land cover types is studied in detail. Also the relation between DSM error and the topography will be investigated...|$|R

40|$|A {{field-scale}} in situ bioremediation {{test was}} conducted at a chlorinated solvent (mainly 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane) contaminated aquifer to evaluate the feasibility of source-zone treatment through anaerobic reductive dechlorination. Contaminated groundwater was extracted {{at the bottom of}} the <b>testing</b> <b>zone,</b> amended/ mixed with an electron donor (lactate) solution, and reinjected at the head of the <b>testing</b> <b>zone.</b> Both forced groundwater recirculation and lactate injection resulted in significant mobilization of chlorinated contaminants from the source zone, probably through enhanced dissolution of DNAPL (dense nonaqueous phase liquid) pools. The addition of lactate stimulated the establishment of anaerobic conditions in the aquifer and the onset of microbial reductive dechlorination processes. Dechlorination of 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane led to the formation of predominantly 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane and cis-dichloroethene. Noticeably, dechlorination occurred at aqueous 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane concentrations as high as 90 mg L- 1, indicating than in situ bioremediation is a feasible source-treatment strategy for chlorinated solvents such as chloroethane...|$|R

30|$|Our {{contribution}} {{in this study}} is to utilize both the SOM properties and the advantages of spectral clustering, by obtaining the data representatives (prototypes) with the SOM and clustering the SOM prototypes by spectral partitioning using a local density-based similarity CONN instead of a distance-based similarity, for agriculture monitoring. We develop an LPIS quality assessment based on this SOM based spectral clustering, and show that it is successful using three <b>test</b> <b>zones</b> in Hungary. We also compare the proposed method to other SOM based HAC methods and also to neural gas [30] based clustering. The rest of this article is organized as follows: Section ‘Neural networks for unsupervised clusteringment’ explains the clustering methods (HAC and spectral clustering) for these neural networks. Section ‘Study area and images’ describes three <b>test</b> <b>zones</b> and the remote sensing images used in this study. Section ‘Results and discussions’ discusses the clustering performance for these zones, and Section ‘Conclusions’ concludes the article.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} {{an analog}} fiber optic communication system for transporting signals {{in a high}} power Laboratory. Basically, the process involves converting the test signals {{in the range of}} KV and KA in to signals ranging from 200 mV to 200 V, after this these signals are modulated and finally they are transmitted by a fiber optic transceiver from the <b>testing</b> <b>zone</b> to an analog receiver located at a control room. However, several potential error sources should be minimized, among them there is dc shifting and gain variation due to temperature influence along the <b>testing</b> <b>zone.</b> Electronics and software techniques are used to reduce errors in conditioning and transmission of signals. Performances of the fiber optic transceiver were tested in bandwidth, temperature, linearity and signal to noise ratio responses; the result of using diferent compensation techniques showed remarkable improvements to performance of this fiber optic transceiver. The transmission media is optical fiber to ensure signal integrity, avoiding distortion due to EMI caused by the large currents and voltages during tests...|$|R
