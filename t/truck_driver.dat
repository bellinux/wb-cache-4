40|$|<b>Truck</b> <b>drivers</b> {{are one of}} {{the largest}} {{occupational}} groups in Iran. Evidence from previous studies suggests that working and living conditions on the road engender many concerns for <b>truck</b> <b>drivers,</b> and their families and communities. This research aimed to explore the experiences of Iranian <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> regarding life on the road. This qualitative study was conducted among Iranian <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> working in the inter-state transportation sector. A purposeful sample of 20 <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> took part in this research. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed based on qualitative content analysis.

This studyendeavours to document the sexual behaviour andtrends of condom usage, of <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> halting atKalamboli <b>Truck</b> Terminal, Navi Mumbai. MethodThis community based, cross sectional study wasconducted by interviewing 300 male <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> usinga pre-tested structured questionnaire. Data collectedwas compiled and analysed using Mean andPercentages. ResultsOf the 300 <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> interviewed, mean age of firstsexual encounter was 19. 4 years. 270 <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> hadexperienced sexual intercourse and 30 had not. Out of 270 sexually exposed <b>truck</b> <b>drivers,</b> 40. 7 % had sex withcommercial sex workers (CSWs) only, 1. 1 % with othermen only, 0. 7 % with Transsexuals only and 7. 5 % withother known females. 5. 9 % had sex with multiplecategories. Premarital sex was reported in 70. 25 %truck drivers and 28. 4 % married <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> hadextramarital sex. Of the <b>Truck</b> <b>drivers</b> having sexoutside marriage, 53 % used condoms regularly.

40|$|To {{develop and}} {{validate}} a short and user-friendly questionnaire measuring psychological job strain in <b>truck</b> <b>drivers.</b> In cooperation with an occupational physician in the Dutch road transport industry we developed {{items on the}} basis of face validity and information of existing questionnaires on the subject. These items were pilot-tested, by means of interviews, in 15 <b>truck</b> <b>drivers.</b> Study I examined the factorial structure of the initial 30 -item trucker strain monitor (TSM) in a sample of 153 <b>truck</b> <b>drivers.</b> Subsequently, number of items per factor was reduced {{on the basis of}} reliability analyses (Cronbach's alpha). Study II examined construct and criterion validity of the TSM in a randomly selected group of 2, 000 <b>truck</b> <b>drivers,</b> of whom 1, 111 participated (adjusted response = 63 %). Additionally, sensitivity and specificity were assessed by examining the ability of the TSM to identify <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> with or without self-reported sickness absence in the past 12 months because of psychological complaints. Factor analyses of the initial 30 -item TSM revealed a two-factor solution. Item reduction resulted in a six-item work-related fatigue scale and four-item sleeping problems scale with high internal consistency. Results of study II confirmed {{the internal consistency of the}} TSM scales and provided support for construct and criterion validity. The composite, work-related fatigue, and sleeping problems scale had a sensitivity of 83 %, 80 % and 71 % respectively, in identifying <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> with prior sickness absence because of psychological complaints. Specificity rates were 72 %, 73 % and 72 % respectively. Despite methodological limitations, the results suggest that the TSM is a reliable and valid indicator of psychological job strain in <b>truck</b> <b>drivers.</b> In particular, the composite and work-related fatigue scale identified drivers with prior absenteeism because of psychological complaints, quite accurately. Future longitudinal research in specific sub-groups of <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> including both self-reported and objective psychological health measures should evidence whether (1) the distinction between two indicators of psychological job strain is useful, and whether (2) the TSM can be used in screening out <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> at risk of developing psychological health problem...|$|R

40|$|Given {{the monotony}} and {{extended}} driving periods inherent in transport <b>truck</b> driving, <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> might rely on stimulants to sustain attention and combat fatigue. Research indicates stimulants improve some cognitive functions but impair driving ability, and stimulant use is common among <b>truck</b> <b>drivers.</b> In addition, stimulant use {{is linked to}} collisions. Research to date on collision culpability among stimulant-positive <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> is sparse and presents with limitations due to small sample sizes {{and a lack of}} control over confounding variables. The present study investigated the influence of stimulants on unsafe driving actions (UDAs) in collisions. The odds of being stimulant-positive were expected to be statistically significantly higher for drivers who committed at least one UDA that led to a collision. Using the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) database, the author compared <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> who had at least one UDA recorded to a control group of drivers who had none. Logistic regression was used in order to account for the influence of confounding variables (age, previous driving record, and other drug-use) and to calculate the odds ratio of being stimulant-positive {{in the event of an}} UDA. Results indicate that the odds of being stimulant-positive are statistically significantly greater for <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> who committed an UDA (OR 2. 29, 95 % CI 1. 7 - 3. 0). In addition, Pearson?s Chi-square models indicated stimulant-positive <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> were significantly more likely to have a history of infractions on their driving record and to have other drugs in their system. The results suggest stimulants negatively influence driving ability and <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> should not use stimulants while driving. In addition, the results support the inclusion of previous driving record and other drug use data as control variables for future studies. Despite this, the finding that 0. 58 % of <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> in the FARS database tested positive for stimulants suggests that stimulant use is not common...|$|R

Low back pain {{continues to be the}} most common musculoskeletal problem in the work place. It affects many workers and contributes to high costs to the companies and individuals. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the magnitude and risk factors for low back pain among <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> in Dar es Salaam Methods: A cross-sectional survey using quantitative research methods were used, where by 415, <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> were interviewed by using structured questionnaire consisting of close ended questions and body weight in kg was measured by using weighing scale machine and tape measure used to check height in cm,BMI in kg/m 2 was calculated by using calculators. Pwani Haulier Company located in Temeke which has 900 <b>trucks</b> and 1000 <b>drivers</b> was chosen for the study. Simple random sampling using lottery method was used to select 415 respondents. Validity and reliability of data questionnaires were tested to forty one <b>truck</b> <b>drivers.</b> The collected data were analyzed using the computer software program (SPSS version 16). Results: Findings revealed a high prevalence of LBP among <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> in Dar es Salaam as presented by 88. 7 % of all study respondents. Moreover, suitable truck seat and adjustable lead restraint and lordosis pad were associated with LBP. Consequently the findings revealed that car vibration, BMI, resting time, work experience, age as well education level showed to have statistically no association with LBP among <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> in Dar es Salaam. Conclusion and recommendation: This study identified a high prevalence of LBP among <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> in Dar es Salaam. With these findings it is highly recommended that truck seat as well as adjustable lead restrains be used so as to reduce LBP among <b>truck</b> <b>drivers.</b> Moreover other studies should be carried out to determine other factors which might contribute to LBP among <b>truck</b> <b>drivers,</b> abreast the proper preventive intervention to mitigate this occupational health problem should be well known to all stakeholders...|$|R
