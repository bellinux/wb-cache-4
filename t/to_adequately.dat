5|$|Lighting {{also served}} Gaudí for the {{organisation}} of space, which required a careful {{study of the}} gradient of light intensity <b>to</b> <b>adequately</b> adapt to each specific environment. He achieved this with different elements such as skylights, windows, shutters and blinds; a notable case is the gradation of colour used in the atrium of the Casa Batlló to achieve uniform distribution of light throughout the interior. He also tended to build south-facing houses to maximise sunlight.|$|E
40|$|Is it {{possible}} to justify requiring that I respond <b>adequately</b> <b>to</b> the other’s vulnerability? I contend that insofar as I value my own personal identity it is consistent <b>to</b> respond <b>adequately</b> <b>to</b> {{the vulnerability of the}} other. Part one provides a break down of vulnerability in terms of its fundamental indeterminacy. Part two illustrates how the ability <b>to</b> respond either <b>adequately</b> or inadequately <b>to</b> the other’s vulnerability is implied by the fundamental co-constitution of personal identity. I understand myself as a self only insofar as I stand in relation to other selves that see me as a self. If the relationship between recognition and identity also holds for the other, my response to her vulnerability founds her identity as well. In part three the relationship developed in part two is employed to justify the obligation <b>to</b> respond <b>adequately</b> <b>to</b> the vulnerable other. If I value my own personal identity, then I require an adequate response from others, because that response plays an integral role in the foundation of my personal identity. The other cannot respond <b>adequately</b> <b>to</b> my vulnerability unless her own identity is assured. Only if I respond <b>adequately</b> <b>to</b> the vulnerability of the other will she {{be in a position to}} assure my identity. Therefore, I ought <b>to</b> respond <b>adequately</b> <b>to</b> the vulnerability of others if for no other reason than it puts the other in a position where she can assure the personal identity that I value...|$|R

5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect 47 Ursae Majoris b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. Preliminary astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos satellite suggest the planet's orbit is inclined at an angle of 63.1° to {{the plane of the}} sky, which would imply a true mass 12% greater than the lower limit determined by radial velocity measurements. However, subsequent investigation of the data reduction techniques used suggests that the Hipparcos measurements are not precise enough <b>to</b> <b>adequately</b> characterise the orbits of substellar companions, and the true inclination of the orbit (and hence the true mass) are regarded as unknown.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} USAF investigation {{blamed the}} accident on several factors. The F-15 pilots were faulted for misidentifying the helicopters as hostile. Also, {{the crew members}} of the AWACS aircraft were blamed for their inaction in failing to exercise appropriate control and for not intervening in the situation. In addition, the {{identification friend or foe}} (IFF) systems had not functioned to identify the helicopters to the F-15 pilots. Furthermore, USAF leaders had failed <b>to</b> <b>adequately</b> integrate U.S. Army helicopter operations into overall OPC air operations. As a result of the investigation several USAF officers received administrative discipline but only one, Jim Wang, an AWACS crew member, was tried by military court-martial, in which he was acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Britain, {{which had}} {{concluded}} in 1892 {{that it needed}} twice as many cruisers as any potential enemy <b>to</b> <b>adequately</b> protect its empire's sea lanes, responded to the perceived threat by laying down its own large armoured cruisers. Between 1899 and 1905, it completed or laid down seven classes of this type, a total of 35 ships. This building program, in turn, prompted the French and Russians to increase their own construction. The Imperial German Navy began to build large armoured cruisers for use on their overseas stations, laying down eight between 1897 and 1906.|$|E

Rennyo refused to support these rebellions, and the Ikkō-ikki were quickly defeated and forced to take refuge in neighboring Etchū. Shimotsuma Rensu, a ji-samurai from Echizen and an advisor to Rennyo, led another revolt, falsely claiming that Rennyo authorized his actions. This revolt also failed, and Rennyo excommunicated Rensu.|$|E

As soon as the French prize crew was removed, Lieutenant Philip Fitz Gibbon, the remaining officer on Ceylon, rehoisted British colours and assumed control of the ship. This allowed Boadicea to sail past the recaptured frigate and engage the French ships directly, reaching Vénus at 16:40. Hamelin recognised that the battered state of his flagship meant {{that he would not}} be able <b>to</b> <b>adequately</b> defend against Rowley's attack and ordered Victor to take news of his defeat back to Port Napoleon. Readying his ship for a token action, Hamelin fired at Boadicea as she came up but was forced to surrender within ten minutes.|$|E
5|$|Implementation of the Bland–Allison Act {{did not end}} {{calls for}} free silver. The 1880s saw a steep decline in the prices of grain and other {{agricultural}} commodities. Silver advocates argued that this dropoff, which caused the price of grain to fall below its cost of production, {{was caused by the}} failure of the government <b>to</b> <b>adequately</b> increase the money supply, which had remained steady on a per capita basis. Advocates of the gold standard attributed the decline to advances in production and transportation. The late 19th century saw divergent views in economics as the laissez-faire orthodoxy was questioned by younger economists, and both sides found ample support for their views from theorists.|$|E

Supporters of evolution further contend that no alternative explanation {{has been able}} <b>to</b> <b>adequately</b> explain the biological origin of these phenomena either.|$|E

Zhekov requested that Germany immediately reinforce the Balkan Front, hinting that Austria-Hungary would also be required to strengthen its positions in Albania. On 17 August, Hindenburg pledged to provide Bulgaria with support once the situation on other front permits it. Hindenburg's reluctance to support Bulgaria was also manifested by the early September redeployment of the last German Jäger battalion stationed in Macedonia back into Germany.|$|E
