25|$|Many toothpastes make {{whitening}} claims. Some {{of these}} toothpastes contain peroxide, the same ingredient found in tooth bleaching gels. The abrasive in these toothpastes, not the peroxide, removes the stains. Whitening toothpaste cannot alter the natural color of teeth or reverse discoloration by penetrating surface stains or decay. To remove surface stains, whitening toothpaste may include abrasives to gently polish the teeth or additives such as sodium <b>tripolyphosphate</b> {{to break down}} or dissolve stains. When used twice a day, whitening toothpaste typically takes two to four weeks to make teeth appear whiter. Whitening toothpaste is generally safe for daily use, but excessive use might damage tooth enamel. Teeth whitening gels represent an alternative. However, the whitening process can permanently reduce {{the strength of the}} teeth, as the process scrapes away a protective outer layer of enamel.|$|E

40|$|Clean label” {{has become}} the {{normality}} in the food industry. Many consumers have become increasingly concerned with the added ingredients in their food products and the meat industry is not exempt from these concerns. Consequently, processed meat products could benefit from the elimination of synthetic non-meat additives. Citrus fiber {{has the potential to}} serve as a natural alternative to sodium <b>tripolyphosphate</b> in processed meat and minimize changes in sensory characteristics associated with an acceptable product. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the functionality of citrus fiber as a natural alternative to sodium <b>tripolyphosphate</b> in an uncured all-pork bologna and an oven-roasted turkey breast. Five bologna treatments were produced using the following sodium <b>tripolyphosphate</b> replacement formulations: 1) sodium <b>tripolyphosphate</b> control (STPP), 2) no sodium <b>tripolyphosphate</b> control (No STPP), 3) 0. 50 % citrus fiber (0. 50 % CF), 4) 0. 75 % citrus fiber (0. 75 % CF), and 1. 00 % citrus fiber (1. 00 % CF). The treatments all maintained acceptable quality throughout a 98 -day shelf life. Citrus fiber treatments resulted in bologna with acceptable technological parameters, as indicated by similar cook/chill yields and emulsion stability compared with the STPP control. Lipid oxidation across all treatments was maintained for the entirety of the 98 -day shelf life period. There were slight differences among sensory evaluation scores for texture and moistness, with the citrus fiber treatments perceived as being softer and less moist; however, these contradicted the TPA measurement data showing the citrus fiber treatments as harder than the sodium <b>tripolyphosphate</b> control. The citrus fiber treatments were harder, less resilient, less cohesive, and less springy compared to the sodium <b>tripolyphosphate</b> control. Sensory evaluation of color showed no difference in lightness throughout the 98 -day shelf life. While there were instrumental color differences, they were slight and did not result in a product that was visually different or unappealing compared to the sodium <b>tripolyphosphate</b> control. Four oven-roasted turkey treatments were produced using the following: 1) sodium <b>tripolyphosphate</b> control (STPP), 2) no sodium <b>tripolyphosphate</b> control (No STPP), 3) 0. 25 % citrus fiber (0. 25 % CF), and 4) 0. 50 % citrus fiber (0. 50 % CF). The treatments all maintained acceptable quality throughout an 84 -day shelf life. Citrus fiber treatments resulted in turkey with acceptable technological parameters, as indicated by similar cook/chill yields compared to the STPP control. Lipid oxidation across all treatments was maintained for the entirety of the 84 -day shelf life period. There were slight differences among sensory evaluation scores for moistness, with the citrus fiber treatments perceived as being less moist.

40|$|ABSTRACT Turkey breast muscle was {{injected}} {{with salt and}} various types of phosphate (sodium tripolyphosphate; 90 % sodium <b>tripolyphosphate</b> and 10 % sodium hexametaphosphate; 75 % sodium <b>tripolyphosphate</b> and 25 % sodium hexametaphosphate; 90 % sodium <b>tripolyphosphate</b> and 10 % tetrasodium pyrophosphate) solutions to 3 % of green weight. After injection, breasts were tumbled in a cold room in a laboratory-sized tumbler for 2 hr at 20 rpm with alternate intervals of tumbling for 10 min and 10 min of rest {{for a total of}} 1 hr of tumbling. The presence of salt, during tumbling, significantly reduced expressible moisture and cooking losses but did not significantly affect shear values. All of the phosphates used significantly reduced expressible moisture and cooking losses without influencing shear values. Sensory properties (binding ability, juiciness, and flavor) of rolls made from tumbled meat were significantly improved when the breast muscle was tumbled in the presence of salt and phosphates. A combination of sodium <b>tripolyphosphate</b> and sodium hexametaphosphate significantly improved extractability of myofibrillar proteins during the tumbling process as compared to other phosphate sources.

40|$|Objectives The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to prepare gliclazide–chitosan microparticles with <b>tripolyphosphate</b> by ionic crosslinking. Methods Chitosan microparticles were produced by emulsification and ionotropic gelation. The effects of process variables including chitosan concentration, pH of <b>tripolyphosphate</b> solution, glutaraldehyde volume and release modifier agent such as pectin added to the <b>tripolyphosphate</b> crosslinking solution were evaluated. The microparticles were examined with scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning colorimetry. The serum glucose lowering effect of gliclazide microparticles was studied in streptozotocin-diabetic rabbits compared with the effect of pure gliclazide powder and gliclazide commercial tablets. Key findings The particle sizes of tripolyphosphate–chitosan microparticles were over the range 675 – 887 mm and the loading efficiency of drug was greater than 94. 0 %. In-vivo testing of the gliclazide–chitosan microparticles in diabetic rabbits demonstrated a significant antidiabetic effect of gliclazide–chitosan microparticles after 8 h that lasted for 18 h compared with gliclazide powder, which produced a maximum hypoglycaemic effect after 4 h.
