25|$|Elasmobranchs' {{ability to}} enter fresh water is limited because their blood is {{normally}} {{at least as}} salty (in terms of osmotic strength) as seawater through the accumulation of urea and <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide,</b> but bull sharks living in fresh water show a significantly reduced concentration of urea within their blood. Despite this, the solute composition (i.e. osmolarity) of a bull shark in fresh water is still much {{higher than that of}} the external environment. This results in a large influx of water across the gills due to osmosis and loss of sodium and chloride from the shark's body. However, bull sharks in fresh water possess several organs with which to maintain appropriate salt and water balance; these are the rectal gland, kidneys, liver, and gills. All elasmobranchs have a rectal gland which functions in the excretion of excess salts accumulated as a consequence of living in seawater. Bull sharks in freshwater environments decrease the salt-excretory activity of the rectal gland, thereby conserving sodium and chloride./K+-ATPase activity in gill, rectal gland, kidney and intestine|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B|year=2005|volume=175 |issue=1 |pages=37–44 |pmid=15565307|url=http://www.sciencecollege.com/sharklab/courses/elasmobiology/readings/pillans.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00360-004-0460-2}} The kidneys produce large amounts of dilute urine, but also {{play an important role in}} the active reabsorption of solutes into the blood.

Recent work also shows that the differences in density of fresh water to that of marine waters result in significantly greater negative buoyancies in sharks occupying fresh water, resulting in increasing costs of living in fresh water. Bull sharks caught in freshwater have subsequently been shown to have lower liver densities than sharks living in marine waters. This may reduce the added cost of greater negative buoyancy.|$|E

40|$|Longstanding {{mechanistic}} {{questions about}} the role of protecting osmolyte <b>trimethylamine</b> N- <b>oxide</b> (TMAO) which favors protein folding and the denaturing osmolyte urea are addressed by studying their effects on the folding of uncharged polymer chains. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we show that 1 -M TMAO and 7 -M urea solutions act dramatically differently on these model polymer chains. Their behaviors are sensitive to the strength of the attractive dispersion interactions of the chain with its environment: when these dispersion interactions are high enough, TMAO suppresses the formation of extended conformations of the hydrophobic polymer as compared to water, while urea promotes formation of extended conformations. Similar trends are observed experimentally on real protein systems. Quite surprisingly, we find that both protecting and denaturing osmolytes strongly interact with the polymer, seemingly in contrast with existing explanations of the osmolyte effect on proteins. We show that what really matters for a protective osmolyte is its effective depletion as the polymer conformation changes, which leads to a negative change in the preferential binding coefficient. For TMAO, there is a much more favorable free energy of insertion of a single osmolyte near collapsed conformations of the polymer than near extended conformations. By contrast, urea is preferentially stabilized next to the extended conformation and thus has a denaturing effect...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The deep-sea, hypersaline anoxic brine {{lakes in}} the Mediterranean {{are among the}} most extreme environments on earth, and in one of them, the MgCl 2 -rich Discovery basin, the {{presence}} of active microbes is equivocal. However, thriving microbial communities have been detected especially in the chemocline between deep seawater and three NaCl-rich brine lakes, l'Atalante, Bannock and Urania. By contrast, the microbiota of these brine-lake sediments remains largely unexplored. Results Eighty nine isolates were obtained from the sediments of four deep-sea, hypersaline anoxic brine lakes in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea: l'Atalante, Bannock, Discovery and Urania basins. This culture collection was dominated by representatives of the genus Bacillus and close relatives (90 % of all isolates) that were investigated further. Physiological characterization of representative strains revealed large versatility with respect to enzyme activities or substrate utilization. Two third of the isolates did not grow at in-situ salinities and were presumably present as endospores. This is supported by high numbers of endospores in Bannock, Discovery and Urania basins ranging from 3. 8 × 10 5 to 1. 2 × 10 6 g - 1 dw sediment. However, the remaining isolates were highly halotolerant growing at salinities of up to 30 % NaCl. Some of the novel isolates affiliating with the genus Pontibacillus grew well under anoxic conditions in sulfidic medium by fermentation or anaerobic respiration using dimethylsulfoxide or <b>trimethylamine</b> N- <b>oxide</b> as electron acceptor.

40|$|Direct {{architecture}} of complex nanostructures is desirable and still remains {{a challenge in}} areas of materials science. Due to their size-, shape-dependent electronic and optical properties, much effort {{has been made to}} control morphologies of transition metal oxide nanoparticles and to organize them into complicated 3 D structures using templates. In particular, manganese oxides have attracted much attention because they have extensive applications in many chemical processes due to their porous structures, acidity, ionexchange, separation, catalysis, and energy storage in secondary batteries. Using organic templates such as <b>trimethylamine</b> (TMA), manganese <b>oxides</b> have been successfully organized into macroscopic rings and helices via sol-gel processes. However, the methods mentioned above all need further purification, so impurities will be avoided. Subsequent procedures are needed to obtain pure products. Thus facile and template-free methods are highly desired for synthesis of manganese oxide nanaoparticles with complex 3 D structures. ^ Manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieves (OMS) are a class of microporous transition metallic oxides with various kinds of tunnel structures that can be synthesized via controlling synthetic conditions such as temperature, concentration, pH, and cations. Manganese oxide molecular sieves are semiconducting mixed-valence catalysts that utilize electron transport to catalyze reactions such as selective oxidation of alcohols. OMS has distinct advantages over aluminosilicate molecular sieve materials for applications in catalysis due to the mixed valence character. The synthesis of manganese oxide OMS materials will be much more complicated than those of main group metallic oxides because of different coordination numbers and oxidation states. OMS-type materials with desirable morphologies formed under mild synthetic conditions are highly desirable. Herein, we report a template-free, low temperature preparation of porous cryptomelane-type manganese oxide (OMS- 2) 3 D nanostructures. ^ The objectives of this research include exploration of new methods to oxidize Mn 2 + in aqueous solution either under low-temperature reflux or hydrothermal conditions. Various oxidants were used with precisely controlled synthetic parameters such as temperature, concentrations of starting materials, pH, and kinds of templates. ^ A variety of techniques including powder X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) scanning electron microscopy are used to investigate the structures of synthesized materials. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy are utilized to studying the morphology and topography. The surface areas of the materials is measured by the BET method.

Following lipophilic transfection to lens epithelial B 3 cells, the recombinant mutated CRYAA protein was highly insoluble upon 0. 5 % Triton X- 100 (Tx) extraction. It was retained and formed aggregation, and distributed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) along with the ER resident protein (protein disulfide isomerise). The wild-type (WT) CRYAA {{was found to be}} soluble and diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. The accumulation of G 98 R mutant induced ER stress, and the affected cells were prone to apoptosis. After treatment with a small chemical molecule, the natural osmolyte <b>trimethylamine</b> N <b>oxide</b> (TMAO), the Tx insolubility of mutant protein was reduced in dose- and time-dependent manners. It was also prone to be degraded via ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP). In mutant-expressing cells, the mutant protein aggregation was decreased after treatment. The ER stress and the rate of apoptosis were also alleviated, probably mediated by heat shock response, as demonstrated by the effect of TMAO on heat shock protein 70 expression. The third eye gene model was myocilin (MYOC), the first identified gene responsible for primary open angle glaucoma. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if glaucoma-causing MYOC variants, including D 384 N MYOC, could be correctable. D 384 N MYOC was identified in a Chinese family diagnosed with high tension juvenile-onset primary open-angle glaucoma. Disease causing mutations in MYOC (R 82 C, C 245 Y, Q 368 X P 370 L, T 377 M, D 380 A, D 384 N, R 422 C, R 422 H, C 433 R, Y 437 H, I 477 N, I 477 S and N 480 K) were cloned into mammalian expression vector p 3 XFLAG-myc-CMV"- 25 and the sequences confirmed by direct sequencing. Following lipophilic transfection to human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells, the Tx solubility and secretion of MYOC and cell apoptosis were examined in the presence or not with small chemical treatments. 4 -PBA, TMAO and deuterium oxide (D 2 O), reduced the portion of insoluble fractions to various extents in the mutant proteins. The osmolytes TMAO and D 2 O were more effective than 4 -PBA in improving MYOC solubility. TMAO was further shown to improve the secretion and ER-Golgi trafficking of D 384 N MYOC, thereby reducing the ER stress and rescuing cells from apoptosis. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) The truncated G 165 fsX 8 gammaD-crystallin (CRYGD) variant was studied to further examine the effects of small chemical-assisted protein rescue of a CRYGD mutant that causes congenital cataract. G 165 fsX 8 CRYGD was identified in a Chinese family with nuclear type of congenital cataract. The mutation was cloned into a mammalian expression vector p 3 XFLAG-myc-CMV"- 25 and sequence was confirmed by direct sequencing. Following lipophilic transfection to COS- 7 cells, the G 165 fsX 8 CRYGD mutant protein was significantly insoluble upon 0. 5 % Tx extraction and was mistrafficked to the nuclear envelope with co-localization with nuclear lamins, whereas WT protein was Tx soluble and nuclear located. Treatment with small chemical sodium 4 -phenylbutyrate (4 -PBA) substantially reduced the Tx insolubility and reversed the mutant protein to nuclear localization. This correction has resulted in better cell survival, probably via a heat-shock response, as demonstrated by heat-shock protein 70 up-regulation. To date, many genes and mutations are identified to cause various ocular diseases. Some of them result in a disruption of protein folding, an important cause of disease pathogenesis and progression. In my laboratory, novel mutations of crystallins and myocilin have been identified to segregate with congenital cataract and primary open-angle glaucoma, respectively. In this thesis, I reported molecular investigations of the resultant protein variants and their altered cellular functions in relation to the clinical phenotypes that contributed to new understanding of the roles of these genes in ocular tissues.

40|$|BACKGROUND. The choline {{oxidation}} pathway {{comprises the}} sequential metabolism of choline into betaine, dimethylglycine (DMG), and sarcosine. In addition, dietary choline and betaine {{can be turned}} into <b>trimethylamine</b> N-amino <b>oxide</b> (TMAO). Alterations in choline metabolism may relate to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T 2 D). Several investigations have focused on systemic concentrations of choline and betaine; however large-scale prospective data are scarce. There is therefore a need for more comprehensive assessments of choline metabolites in relation to incident CVD, T 2 D and mortality, in addition to investigating any potential benefit in risk prediction from such biomarkers. AIM. We carried out observational cohort studies of the prospective relationships between plasma DMG and incident acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and mortality, as well as the association between systemic and urinary choline metabolites with the risk of incident T 2 D. The biomarkers’ impact on model discrimination and reclassification of patients at risk was also assessed, as were their test-retest reliabilities and temporal trends according to B-vitamin treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Analyses on the association between plasma DMG and incident AMI, as well as the relationships between choline metabolites and incident T 2 D were performed among patients evaluated for suspected stable angina pectoris (SAP). The risk assessment between plasma DMG and mortality included SAP patients and patients with AMI from an independent cohort. Clinical endpoint data were obtained from regional and national health registries. Endpoint analyses on incident AMI and mortality were carried out by Cox regression, whereas analyses on incident T 2 D were performed by logistic regression. Model discrimination and reclassification were explored by calculating the C-statistics, the integrated discrimination index (IDI), and the continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI> 0), respectively. Mixed linear modelling was used for assessing temporal trends in metabolite concentrations. RESULTS. Higher plasma DMG was associated with several traditional risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). After about {{four and a half years}} of follow-up, plasma DMG showed linear relationships with incident AMI among 4154 patients with suspected SAP (age, gender and fasting adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the fourth vs. first quartile (95 % confidence intervals (CI)) 1. 95 (1. 42 - 2. 68); P< 0. 001). The relationship between plasma DMG and incident AMI was particularly strong among non-smokers and patients with lower serum apoB and triglyceride levels (P for interaction≤ 0. 03). Among essentially the same patients, as well as among 3733 patients with AMI who were followed for 7 years, higher plasma DMG was also associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (age and gender adjusted HRs (95 % CIs) for the fourth vs. the first quartile 1. 72 (1. 21 – 2. 46) and 1. 76 (1. 42 – 2. 18) among SAP and AMI patients, respectively) and CVD mortality (HRs (95 % CIs) 1. 94 (1. 21 – 3. 11) and 1. 97 (1. 50 – 2. 59) among SAP and AMI patients, respectively). The associations were only slightly attenuated when adjusting for established CHD risk factors, to which adding plasma DMG also improved risk prediction for both AMI and all-cause mortality. Moreover, plasma DMG showed good to excellent within-person reproducibility throughout repeated measurements among patients not receiving supplementation with folic acid + vitamin B 12. In general, higher plasma choline and lower plasma betaine and serum sarcosine levels were associated with an adverse risk profile of T 2 D. In urine, most choline metabolites were positively related to an adverse diabetes risk profile. After an average follow-up of 7. 5 years, 233 (6. 4 %) out of 3621 non-diabetic patients were registered with new-onset T 2 D. Incident T 2 D was strongly inversely associated with plasma betaine and positively related to urine betaine, DMG and sarcosine (age, gender and fasting adjusted odds ratios (95 % CIs) per 1 SD increment 0. 72 (0. 62 - 0. 83), 1. 25 (1. 09 - 1. 43), 1. 22 (1. 06 - 1. 40), and 1. 30 (1. 13 - 1. 49), respectively). We did not find any relationship between choline or TMAO and incident T 2 D. The estimates were not materially altered when adjusting for a range of traditional T 2 D risk factors and potential confounders, and were similar in sensitivity analyses. Among the choline metabolites associated with new-onset T 2 D in univariate analyses, plasma betaine and urine sarcosine were most strongly related to incident T 2 D, and both indices also enhanced risk prediction when added to the multivariate model. After 1 year, as compared to placebo treatment, supplementation with folic acid + vitamin B 12 lowered plasma DMG and sarcosine, but increased plasma betaine and choline. No alterations in plasma TMAO were observed. In urine, we observed similar responses to supplementation as to those seen in blood. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS. Among patients with suspected or verified SAP, high plasma DMG was related to increased risk of AMI, as well as all-cause and CVD mortality, the latter endoints being validated among patients with AMI. Moreover, plasma DMG improved risk prediction of both AMI and mortality. Lower plasma betaine and higher urine betaine, DMG and sarcosine concentrations were related to incident T 2 D. Plasma betaine and urine sarcosine also improved reclassification of patients at risk. Plasma DMG and betaine, as well as urine sarcosine showed good to excellent within-subject reproducibility among patients not supplemented with folic acid + vitamin B 12, justifying one-time assessment of biomarker status. Our observational findings suggest novel pathophysiological pathways involved in conditions heavily impacting the global burden of disease, warranting more research into the field of one-carbon and choline metabolism in relation to life-style related diseases...|$|R

At the time, United Fruit Company (the predecessor to Chiquita Brands International Inc) was struggling to contain the spread of a soil-born fungus destroying its banana farms in Latin America, known as Panama disease (Fusarium Wilt). Wornick, who helped come up with a treatment for Panama Disease, was promoted to scientist and later a division president in charge of food processing. MIT awarded him a graduate degree shortly thereafter.|$|E
50|$|Elasmobranchs' {{ability to}} enter fresh water is limited because their blood is {{normally}} {{at least as}} salty (in terms of osmotic strength) as seawater through the accumulation of urea and <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide,</b> but bull sharks living in fresh water show a significantly reduced concentration of urea within their blood. Despite this, the solute composition (i.e. osmolarity) of a bull shark in fresh water is still much {{higher than that of}} the external environment. This results in a large influx of water across the gills due to osmosis and loss of sodium and chloride from the shark's body. However, bull sharks in fresh water possess several organs with which to maintain appropriate salt and water balance; these are the rectal gland, kidneys, liver, and gills. All elasmobranchs have a rectal gland which functions in the excretion of excess salts accumulated as a consequence of living in seawater. Bull sharks in freshwater environments decrease the salt-excretory activity of the rectal gland, thereby conserving sodium and chloride. The kidneys produce large amounts of dilute urine, but also {{play an important role in}} the active reabsorption of solutes into the blood. The gills of bull sharks are likely to be involved in the uptake of sodium and chloride from the surrounding fresh water, whereas urea is produced in the liver as required with changes in environmental salinity. Recent work also shows that the differences in density of fresh water to that of marine waters result in significantly greater negative buoyancies in sharks occupying fresh water, resulting in increasing costs of living in fresh water. Bull sharks caught in freshwater have subsequently been shown to have lower liver densities than sharks living in marine waters. This may reduce the added cost of greater negative buoyancy.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{relationship}} between the decomposition of <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide</b> in Pacific shrimp and shrimp meat quality was investigated {{to evaluate the use}} of the <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide</b> system as a quality control indice. Changes in the levels of <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide</b> and its decomposition products in whole shrimp stored on ice and in its derived raw and cooked meat and in raw shrimp meat stored under refrigeration (1 - 2 °C) were investigated. The concentration dependency of the decomposition of <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide</b> to dimethylamine and formaldehyde in frozen storage (- 18 °C) and the heat sensitivity of the <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide</b> decomposition systena was evaluated. A statistical {{relationship between}} amine and formaldehyde levels in whole shrimp and raw and cooked meat stored under laboratory conditions and obtained from commercial processing plants with flavor panel scores was developed. <b>Trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide</b> levels decreased in a linear manner in whole shrimp, and in the raw and cooked meat during iced storage. This apparent disappearance was related to the washing action of melting ice and its degradation to trimethylamine, dimethylamine and formaldehyde. Levels of dimethylamine and formaldehyde increased in a parallel manner during iced storage. Trimethylamine levels increased steadily during the first four days of storage, followed by rapid increase during the latter four days reflecting a microbial out-growth. <b>Trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide</b> levels in raw shrimp meat held at 1 - 2 °C decreased during the first four days of storage at a relatively slow rate, followed by a sharp decline during the remainder of an eight day storage period. Trimethylamine levels were shown to remain relatively constant during the first four days of storage, followed by a rapid increase in levels reflecting the decline of <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide</b> levels. Dimethylamine and formaldehyde levels increased rapidly in a linear manner during the storage period. Dimethylamine and formaldehyde levels in frozen raw shrimp meat increased during storage (- 18 °C) in a linear manner. The rate of dimethylamine formation was shown to depend upon initial <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide</b> levels and/or enzyme concentration. A rate dependency on <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide</b> for formaldehyde was not established. The presumably enzyme-catalyzed mechanism of dimethylamine formation was found to be completely inactivated by the exposure of the raw meat to water at 100 °C for 15 seconds. Flavor panel scores for cooked meat derived from whole shrimp stored on ice declined in a linear manner over an eight day storage period. Scores for these samples of shrimp meat and samples obtained from commercial processing plants correlated well with <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide,</b> dimethylamine, and formaldehyde levels in whole shrimp and derived raw and cooked meat. Trimethylamine levels, indicative of microbial out-growth provided correlations inferior to these indices. The magnitude of change observed in <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide</b> levels accurately reflected flavor panel scores. The simplicity of its determination supports its use in quality control practices...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} is presented for {{the determination of}} dimethylamine in crude liquors containing, in addition to dimethylamine, monomethylamine, trimethylamine and <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide.</b> The sample is treated with nitrous acid which destroys most of the monomethylamine, converts dimethylamine to dimethylnitrosamine, and leaves trimethylamine and <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide</b> substantially unaffected. The establishment of the alkalinity at treating has been difficult according to F. L. ENGLISH but in our experiment, that alkalinity is got simply comparatively. The dimethylnitrosamine is determined polarographically. We can recognized the following fact, by the above mentioned method, that is, long-dried sardine sample contains dimethylamine, and on the contrary fresh does not...|$|E
40|$|The {{technique}} of {{thin layer chromatography}} was studied {{as one of the}} methods to analyze methylamines and trimethylamine-N-oxide. Methylamines and <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide,</b> which are difficult to separate in their free form or salt, were successfully separated by thin layer chromatography when these substances had previously been converted to their 3, 5 -dinitrobenzoate. It was observed that, in this method, cellulose ion exchanger is most suitable for the adsorbent and 12 % acetic acid water solution for the developer. By this method, methylamines and <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>oxide</b> were determined after having been isalated from spine species of fish and marine products...|$|E
