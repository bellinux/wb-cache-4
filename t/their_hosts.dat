5|$|The {{parasitoid}} {{chalcid wasp}} Ixodiphagus hookeri {{has been investigated}} for its potential to control tick populations. It lays its eggs into ticks; the hatching wasps kill <b>their</b> <b>hosts.</b>|$|E
5|$|These parasites attach {{themselves}} to <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> {{by means of}} disks that bear crescent-shaped hooks. They are divided into Monogenea and Cestoda.|$|E
5|$|Arp 220 {{hosts the}} first megamaser discovered, is the nearest ultraluminous {{infrared}} galaxy, {{and has been}} studied in great detail at many wavelengths. For this reason, it is the prototype of hydroxyl megamaser host galaxies, and is often used {{as a guide for}} interpreting other hydroxyl megamasers and <b>their</b> <b>hosts.</b>|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of Hyperion all the known regular planetary natural satellites in the Solar System are tidally locked to <b>their</b> <b>host</b> planet, so they have zero rotation relative to <b>their</b> <b>host</b> planet, but have prograde rotation relative to the Sun because they have prograde orbits around <b>their</b> <b>host</b> planet.|$|R
50|$|NSE {{features}} a tuition reciprocity {{system that allows}} students to attend <b>their</b> <b>host</b> institution by paying either the in-state/in-province tuition of <b>their</b> <b>host</b> institution or the normal tuition of their home campus.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Hibiscus hamabo. They {{mine the}} leaves of <b>their</b> <b>host</b> plant. The young larvae form a long red linear mine. Older larvae bore the stem of <b>their</b> <b>host</b> plant.|$|R
5|$|Australia {{were left}} {{a target of}} 225 for victory. Davidson fell for eight {{as part of a}} Jasu Patel-inspired collapse. Patel took 14/124 and Australia were out for 105. This {{resulted}} in Australia's first loss in the fifteen Tests since Davidson began leading the attack, and their first at the hands of <b>their</b> <b>hosts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Natural predators {{of black}} bean aphids include both adults and larvae of ladybirds and lacewings and the larvae of hoverflies. Certain species of tiny {{parasitic}} wasps {{lay their eggs}} inside aphids and the developing wasp larvae devour <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> from inside. Members of the wasp genera Diaeretiella and Lysiphlebus behave in this way and may provide a measure of control of the aphids.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} is hunted by {{birds of prey}} {{including}} the Eurasian sparrowhawk. As {{with other members of}} its genus, it is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. Eggs laid by cuckoos that specialise in using pipits as <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> are similar in appearance to those of the pipit.|$|E
50|$|Kyrzin is {{a prince}} of slime and ooze who lives beneath the Shadow Marches. Kyrzin has created {{numerous}} types of oozes, including parasitic oozes that may control <b>their</b> <b>host</b> or burst from <b>their</b> <b>host's</b> flesh.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Santolina species. They {{mine the}} leaves of <b>their</b> <b>host</b> plant. The larvae live freely at the {{underside}} of {{the leaves of}} <b>their</b> <b>host</b> plant, creating small fleck mines. Larvae can be found in May.|$|R
50|$|In {{comparison}} to A. echinatior, the females of A. insinuator are on average smaller, males are on average larger and the minor workers are relatively indistinguishable from <b>their</b> <b>host</b> counterparts. However, {{a more recent}} study has noted {{a decrease in the}} metapleural glands of the A. insinuator workers in {{comparison to}} <b>their</b> <b>host.</b> It is hypothesized this decrease in gland size represents the reduced importance for disease resistance mechanisms as the species becomes more reliant on <b>their</b> <b>host's</b> herd immunity, and more importantly - a decreased investment in the production of a worker caste. This is also a common characteristic of social parasites in that they deviate further from their commonalities with <b>their</b> <b>host</b> species.|$|R
5|$|The {{animals that}} eat the figs {{disperse}} the seeds, which then germinate and grow on other plants (epiphytes) or on rocks (lithophytes). As the new plants develop, they send roots {{to the forest}} floor. Figs growing on other plants grow larger and larger until they strangle <b>their</b> <b>hosts.</b> Ficus obliqua is long-lived, and trees are thought to live in excess of 500 years.|$|E
5|$|The plot of {{the episode}} sees FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} the deaths of an Alaskan research team. Isolated and alone, the agents and their accompanying team discover the existence of extraterrestrial parasitic organisms which drive <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> into impulsive fits of rage.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} is hunted by {{birds of prey}} {{including}} the Eleonora's falcon, and eggs and young may be taken by terrestrial predators including stoats and snakes. As {{with other members of}} its genus, the water pipit is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. Eggs of cuckoos that specialise in parasitising pipits are similar in appearance to those of <b>their</b> <b>hosts.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Purpose:microRNAshavebeen shown tobe {{involved}} in different human cancers. We there-fore have performed expression profiles {{on a panel}} of pediatric tumors to identify cancer-specificmicroRNAs. Wealso investigated ifmicroRNAsare coregulatedwith <b>their</b> <b>host</b> gene. Experimental Design: We performed parallel microRNAs and mRNA expression profil-ing on 57 tumor xenografts and cell lines representing 10 different pediatric solid tu-mors using microarrays. For those microRNAs that map to <b>their</b> <b>host</b> mRNA, we calculated correlations between them. Results: We found {{that the majority of}} cancer types clustered together based on their global microRNA expression profiles by unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Fourteen microRNAswere significantly differentially expressed between rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma, and 8 of themwere validated in independent patient tumor samples. Ex-ploration of the expression of microRNAs in relationship with <b>their</b> <b>host</b> genes showed that the expression for 43 of 68 (63 %) microRNAs located inside known coding geneswas significantly correlated with that of <b>their</b> <b>host</b> genes. Among these 43 microRNAs, 5 of 7 microRNAs in the OncomiR- 1 cluster correlated significantly with <b>their</b> <b>host</b> gen...|$|R

5|$|These parasites' name {{refers to}} the {{cavities}} in their holdfasts (Greek τρῆμα, hole), which resemble suckers and anchor them within <b>their</b> <b>hosts.</b> The skin of all species is a syncitium, a layer of cells that shares a single external membrane. Trematodes are divided into two groups, Digenea and Aspidogastrea (also known as Aspodibothrea).|$|E
5|$|All birds lay amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay camouflaged eggs. There are many {{exceptions}} to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. Species that are victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of <b>their</b> <b>hosts.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Bill Woodfull led Australia back to England on a {{tour that}} had been under a cloud after the tempestuous cricket {{diplomacy}} of the previous bodyline series. Jardine had retired from International cricket in early 1934 after captaining a fraught tour of India and under England's new captain, Bob Wyatt, agreements {{were put in place}} so that bodyline would not be used. However, there were occasions when the Australians felt that <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> had crossed the mark with tactics resembling bodyline.|$|E
25|$|Ichneumonids {{use both}} idiobiont and koinobiont parasitising strategies. Idiobionts paralyze <b>their</b> <b>host</b> and {{prevent it from}} growing while it is eaten. Koinobionts let <b>their</b> <b>host</b> grow and develop while they feed on it. In both strategies, the host {{typically}} dies after some weeks, after which the ichneumonid larva emerges and pupates.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Saxifragaceae species, {{including}} Lithophragma, Heuchera grossulariifolia, Heuchera micrantha and Heuchera saxicola. They initially live in {{a capsule}} of <b>their</b> <b>host</b> plant, feeding on the seeds. Older larvae create a shelter of leaves on <b>their</b> <b>host</b> and complete feeding from within. Pupation takes place inside this shelter.|$|R
40|$|Rare {{earth and}} other trace element abundances are {{determined}} in megacrysts of clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, amphibole, mica, anorthoclase, apatite and zircon, {{as well as}} <b>their</b> <b>host</b> basalts, {{in an effort to}} gather data on mineral/melt trace element partitioning during the high pressure petrogenesis of basic rocks. Phase equilibria, major element partitioning and isotopic ratio considerations indicate that while most of the pyroxene and amphibole megacrysts may have been in equilibrium with <b>their</b> <b>host</b> magmas at high pressures, mica, anorthoclase, apatite, and zircon megacrysts are unlikely to have formed in equilibrium with <b>their</b> <b>host</b> basalts. It is instead concluded that they were precipitated from more evolved magmas, and have been mixed into <b>their</b> present <b>hosts...</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1934, {{having been}} reappointed to a {{position}} on the selection panel, Woodfull led Australia back to England on a tour that had been under a cloud after the tempestuous cricket diplomacy of the previous bodyline series. After agreements were put in place so that bodyline would not be used, the tour went ahead. However, there were occasions when the Australians felt that <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> had crossed the mark with tactics resembling bodyline.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Colbert left The Daily Show {{to host a}} {{spin-off}} series entitled The Colbert Report, {{a parody}} of personality-driven political pundit programs such as Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor that center largely on the personal views of <b>their</b> <b>hosts.</b> Because of this enlarged role, the personality and beliefs of the Stephen Colbert character have become more clearly defined {{over the course of}} the show, complete with a fictitious backstory that has been revealed piecemeal in short monologues accompanying a part of the program.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of {{the sperm}} or egg, which {{manifest}} in the offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, {{which is likely to}} be more important than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into <b>their</b> <b>hosts.</b> Organisms do not want to mutate: mutation just happens. Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, but a very small minority turn out to be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.|$|E

5|$|Not all co-evolved {{interactions}} between species involve conflict. Many cases of mutually beneficial interactions have evolved. For instance, an extreme cooperation exists between {{plants and the}} mycorrhizal fungi that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil. This is a reciprocal relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis. Here, the fungi actually grow inside plant cells, allowing them to exchange nutrients with <b>their</b> <b>hosts,</b> while sending signals that suppress the plant immune system.|$|E
5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to {{synthesize}} the 20 common amino acids. Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential amino acids, so nine essential amino acids must be obtained from food. Some simple parasites, such as the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, lack all amino acid synthesis and take their amino acids directly from <b>their</b> <b>hosts.</b> All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine. Amino acid synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then transaminated to form an amino acid.|$|E
5|$|Prem has an amicable {{relationship}} with his warm-hearted sister-in-law. In time, Pooja and Rajesh discover that they are expecting a child. Professor and Mrs. Chaudhary were unable to come to Kailashnath's house for the ceremony marking the impending arrival of the baby. They send Nisha instead, who is present at the birth. Meanwhile, Nisha and Prem {{fall in love with}} each other, but keep it a secret. Professor and Mrs. Chaudhary come over to Kailashnath's house to celebrate the birth of their grandchild. When the time comes to part, <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> are dejected, especially Prem. He and Nisha promise each other that they will soon reunite for ever.|$|E
40|$|Viruses mercilessly exploit <b>their</b> <b>host</b> {{cells to}} {{guarantee}} their own proliferation and propagation. To achieve this goal, many viruses suppress the apoptotic program, thereby avoiding premature {{death of the}} host cell. Indeed, apoptosis of infected cells may {{be considered as a}} pristine defense against infectious pathogens, as illustrated by a simple Gedankenexperiment: if all host cells died immediately after infection, then the virus could not replicate. It is only at late stages of the viral life cycle that some viruses actively induce apoptosis, either in <b>their</b> <b>host</b> cells or, via a variety of different strategies, in immunologically relevant cells, with the specific aim to subvert the host’s innate or cognate immune response. As viruses have coevoluted with <b>their</b> <b>host</b> to adapt to particular ecological niches, they have “learned ” to target strategic processes in <b>their</b> <b>host</b> cell’s biology...|$|R
