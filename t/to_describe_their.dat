5|$|ATLs {{story is}} {{loosely based on}} {{material}} by producers Dallas Austin and Tionne Watkins, who set out <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>their</b> experiences growing up {{on the south side}} of Atlanta in the early '90s. Watkins and producer Jody Gerson approached James Lassiter with the idea of a story about a skating rink that many involved in the Atlanta music scene had started at, and how all of these people would attend the rink every Sunday night in their teen years.|$|E
5|$|All these controversies {{have led}} {{ethnic groups in}} Macedonia to use terms in {{conflicting}} ways. Despite {{the fact that these}} terms may not always be used in a pejorative way, they may be perceived as such by the ethnic group to which they are applied. Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from Macedonia <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>their</b> own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general.|$|E

5|$|By the 15th century, writers, artists, {{and architects}} in Italy {{were well aware}} of the transformations that were taking place and were using phrases such as modi antichi (in the antique manner) or alle romana et alla antica (in the manner of the Romans and the ancients) <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>their</b> work. In the 1330s Petrarch {{referred}} to pre-Christian times as antiqua (ancient) and to the Christian period as nova (new). From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.|$|E
5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the Son of God was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>their</b> commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E
5|$|In May 1861, Britain and France {{declared}} the South to be belligerents by international law, and their ships {{were entitled to}} {{the same rights as}} U.S.-flagged vessels to remain 24 hours in neutral ports. Nevertheless, Seward was pleased that both nations would not meet with Confederate commissioners or recognize the South as a nation. Britain did not challenge the Union blockade of Confederate ports, and Seward wrote that if Britain continued to avoid interfering in the war, he would not be overly sensitive to what wording they used <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>their</b> policies.|$|E

5|$|In cladistics, a homoplasy is a trait {{shared by}} two or more taxa for any reason other than that they share a common ancestry. Taxa which do share ancestry {{are part of the}} same clade; cladistics seeks to arrange them {{according}} to their degree of relatedness <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>their</b> phylogeny. Homoplastic traits caused by convergence are therefore, {{from the point of view}} of cladistics, confounding factors which could lead to an incorrect analysis.|$|E
5|$|The work of Krafft-Ebing and Ellis {{was widely}} read, {{and helped to}} create public {{consciousness}} of female homosexuality. The sexologists' claims that homosexuality was a congenital anomaly were generally well-accepted by homosexual men; it indicated that their behavior was not inspired by nor {{should be considered a}} criminal vice, as was widely acknowledged. In the absence of any other material <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>their</b> emotions, homosexuals accepted the designation of different or perverted, and used their outlaw status to form social circles in Paris and Berlin. Lesbian began to describe elements of a subculture.|$|E
5|$|In March 1971 South Vietnamese forces, {{supported}} by U.S. air power, launched Operation Lam Son 719, the long-awaited offensive {{to cut the}} Ho Chi Minh trail in southeastern Laos. However, {{the result was a}} failure. North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces had already begun to expand the trail system westward, pushing Royal Lao forces toward the Mekong, slowly extending the territory it controlled, moving west of the trail and creating a larger buffer zone between its logistical system and the South Vietnamese. After Lam Son 719, that process accelerated. Hanoi's effort was simplified {{by the fact that the}} Royalist forces in the south had little experience fighting PAVN and they were quickly overwhelmed. Inept and ineffective were terms utilized <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>their</b> defense. On 30 April 1971 the key town of Attopeu was seized by the communists.|$|E

5|$|Industrial Music for Industrial People was {{originally}} coined by Monte Cazazza as the strapline {{for the record}} label Industrial Records, founded by British art-provocateurs Throbbing Gristle. The first wave of this music appeared with Throbbing Gristle, from London; Cabaret Voltaire, from Sheffield; and Boyd Rice (recording under the name NON), from the United States. Throbbing Gristle first performed in 1976, and began as the musical offshoot of the Kingston upon Hull-based COUM Transmissions. COUM was initially a psychedelic rock group, but began <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>their</b> work as performance art {{in order to obtain}} grants from the Arts Council of Great Britain. COUM was composed of P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti. Beginning in 1972, COUM staged several performances inspired by Fluxus and Viennese Actionism. These included various acts of sexual and physical abjection. Peter Christopherson, an employee of commercial artists Hipgnosis, joined the group in 1974, with Carter joining the following year.|$|E
5|$|Singing {{schools in}} Baltimore were {{few in number}} until the 1830s. Singing masters began {{incorporating}} secular music into their curriculum, and divested themselves from sponsoring churches, {{in the early part}} of the 1830s. Attendance increased drastically, especially after the founding of two important institutions: the Academy, established in 1834 by Ruel Shaw, and the Musical Institute, founded by John Hill Hewitt and William Stoddard. The Academy and the Institute quickly became rivals, and both gave successful performances. Some Baltimore singing masters used new terminology <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>their</b> programs, as the term singing school was falling out of favor; Alonzo Cleaveland founded the Glee School during this era, focusing entirely on secular music. In contrast, religious musical instruction by the middle of the 19th century remained based around itinerant singing masters who taught for a period of time, then continued to new locations.|$|E
5|$|Stowe {{was among}} several authors {{who wrote about}} Florida {{following}} the Civil War. By far, the majority were men who concentrated on hunting prospects, but the women who wrote about the region often used an adolescent narrator who was usually male as a device <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>their</b> encounters with the novelty of what they saw. Stowe wrote simply as herself, something {{that may have been}} allowed because of her celebrity. Gene Burnett, author of Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State writes: Harriet was probably never fully aware of how great had been her influence in advertising Florida to the country, turning it from an obscure down under tip on the map into a beckoning, lush, tropical paradise, to which tens of thousands would flock to help build a state over the following decades. She herself would doubtless have viewed it as a fitting Christian act to help restore a prostrate, defeated brotherland to its feet; Florida's first promoter was merely a Good Samaritan.|$|E

5|$|The lack of {{surviving}} theoretical writing on art and recorded opinion {{from any of}} the pre-16th-century major artists presents still more difficulties in attribution. Dürer, in 1512, was the first artist of the era to properly set down in writing his theories of art, followed by Lucas de Heere in 1565 and Karel van Mander in 1604. Nash believes a more probable explanation for the absence of theoretical writing on art outside Italy is that the northern artists did not yet have the language <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>their</b> aesthetic values, or saw no point in explaining in writing what they had achieved in painting. Surviving 15th-century appreciations of contemporary Netherlandish art are exclusively written by Italians, the best known of which include Cyriacus Ancona in 1449, Bartolomeo Facio in 1456, and Giovanni Santi in 1482.|$|E
