5|$|In the 16th century, the Marsamxett Harbour {{was one of}} the {{two major}} {{harbours}} in the Maltese city of Valletta. In the centre of the harbour was an island, originally known as l'Isolotto and now known as Manoel Island after the fort, which overlooked the city. Shortly after Valletta's construction, the Order of Saint John realised this was a potential vulnerability in the city's defences. As early as 1569, it was proposed that a small fort with a cavalier be built on the Isolotto to prevent the enemy from taking the island and building batteries on it. <b>The</b> <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> again highlighted by the Spanish military engineer Scipione Campi in 1577, and by Giovanni Battista in 1582.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} that followed, there were still some intermittent, mainly artillery, attacks from Serb-held areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina on the Dubrovnik area and elsewhere. The {{remaining}} Serb-held area in Croatia, in Eastern Slavonia, was faced {{with the possibility of}} military confrontation with Croatia. Such a possibility was repeatedly stated by Tuđman after Storm. <b>The</b> <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> underlined by the movement of troops to the region in mid-October, as well as a repeat of an earlier threat to intervene militarily—specifically saying that the Croatian Army could intervene if no peace agreement was reached {{by the end of the}} month.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores <b>the</b> {{power of}} <b>threats</b> in <b>the</b> absence of binding commitment. The threatener cannot commit {{to carry out}} <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> if <b>the</b> victim refuses payment, and cannot commit not to carry out <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> if payment <b>is</b> made. An {{important}} assumption of the model <b>is</b> that once <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> carried out it cannot be repeated. If exercising <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> costly to <b>the</b> threatener, then <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> cannot succeed in extracting money from the victim. If exercising <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> would benefit <b>the</b> threatener, however, then <b>the</b> <b>threat's</b> success depends upon whether <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> may <b>be</b> repeated after a payment is made. In the equilibrium of a finite-period game, <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> carried out and the victim makes no payments. In an infinite-horizon game, however, it is an equilibrium for the victim to make a stream of payments over time. The expectation of future payments keeps the threatener from exercising <b>the</b> <b>threat.</b> 1...|$|R

The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour.

5|$|By 1704, the War of the Spanish Succession was in {{its fourth}} year. The {{previous}} year {{had been one of}} success for France and her allies, most particularly on the Danube, where Marshal Villars and the Elector of Bavaria had created a direct threat to Vienna, the Habsburg capital. Vienna had been saved by dissension between the two commanders, leading to the brilliant Villars being replaced by the less dynamic Marshal Marsin. Nevertheless, by 1704, <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> still real: Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt was already threatening the Empire's eastern approaches, and Marshal Vendôme's forces threatened an invasion from northern Italy. In the courts of Versailles and Madrid, Vienna's fall was confidently anticipated, an event which would almost certainly have led to the collapse of the Grand Alliance.|$|E
5|$|When William Rufus became king of England {{after his}} father's death, Malcolm did not {{intervene}} in the rebellions by supporters of Robert Curthose which followed. In 1091, William Rufus confiscated Edgar Ætheling's lands in England, and Edgar fled north to Scotland. In May, Malcolm marched south, not to raid and take slaves and plunder, but to besiege Newcastle, built by Robert Curthose in 1080. This {{appears to have been}} an attempt to advance the frontier south from the River Tweed to the River Tees. <b>The</b> <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> enough to bring the English king back from Normandy, where he had been fighting Robert Curthose. In September, learning of William Rufus's approaching army, Malcolm withdrew north and the English followed. Unlike in 1072, Malcolm was prepared to fight, but a peace was arranged by Edgar Ætheling and Robert Curthose whereby Malcolm again acknowledged the overlordship of the English king.|$|E
5|$|With {{the truce}} and the {{recognition}} {{that he would not}} conquer Denmark, Harald turned his attention to England. England had belonged to Harthacnut, the son of Cnut the Great, until he died childless in 1042. Harald based his claim to the throne of England on an agreement made between Magnus and Harthacnut in 1038, which stated that if either died, the other would inherit the throne and lands of the deceased. When Harthacnut died, Magnus assumed the crown of Denmark and considered himself the lawful heir to Harthacnut. While Edward the Confessor had himself crowned English king in his absence, Magnus had planned to invade England in 1045, only to be forced to turn his fleet towards Denmark due to an uprising by Sweyn Estridsson. Although <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> temporarily averted by Magnus's death in 1047, Edward's negotiations with his enemies throughout the 1050s gave Harald (as well as Sweyn Estridsson and William of Normandy) an impression that he was a possible heir to Edward. When Edward died in January 1066, he was to Harald's dismay succeeded by Harold Godwinson, a son of one of Edward's advisors.|$|E

5|$|After the games, Evans {{returned}} to the United States to continue his studies and collegiate swimming career. Before the 1984 Olympics, Evans travelled to Hong Kong to train with Haller, who was coaching the British colony's swimming team. Evans revitalised himself under his favourite coach and {{returned to}} his old style of sprinting. He twisted his ankle later in Perth and missed some training time. He won the Australian 100m breaststroke championship to qualify for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and returned to Arizona to continue training. His Olympic campaign was placed in jeopardy when the ASU threatened to remove Evans from the team for skipping their training camp in Australia. <b>The</b> <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> withdrawn after Evans' father confronted the ASU and pointed out that his son was training, although in a different location. Before the Games, Evans joined the Australians for their final training camp at Stanford University in California. Evans arrived in Los Angeles with the same program as in Moscow; he entered both breaststroke events and the medley relay. Evans started brightly to win his heat of the 100m breaststroke in an Olympic record time of 1m 2.87s. His new mark did not last long—John Moffet broke it in a later heat to relegate Evans to the second-fastest qualifying time.|$|E
