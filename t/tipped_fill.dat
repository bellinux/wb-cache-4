40|$|A {{complete}} {{factorial experiment}} using three nitrogen (44, 106 and 160 lbs N/acre) and three water rates (60, 100 and 130 % consumptive use) examined the specific management criteria necessary for obtaining optimum yield {{and quality of}} drip -irrigated 'Jubilee' sweet coni. The crop was planted on I March and harvested on 10 June, with an 86 / 50 °F heat unit accumulation of 1738. When present, a nitrogen deficiency greatly decreased marketable yield, number of marketable ears/plant, mean ear weight, ear length and <b>tip</b> <b>fill.</b> Higher moisture rates generally had less effect on yield and quality than did N rates; however, increasing water rates significantly increased marketable yields and plant height, improved <b>tip</b> <b>fill</b> and lessened the occurrence of blank kernels. The effect of N and water rates on N and dry matter accumulation and on diagnostic plant tissue testing results for sweet corn are also presented. The maximum marketable yield obtained in this experiment was 7. 8 tons per acre, using 160 lbs N/acre and 21. 1 inches of irrigation water...|$|R

30|$|Although {{there is}} no tubular micromotor {{reported}} moving by the bubble recoil mechanism in pure water, alternative mechanisms have offered the possibility of moving such structures in water. On the one hand, diffusion induced the linear and rotational movement of (Pb 0.25 Ba 0.15 Sr 0.6)TiO 3 nanotube growth in AAO membranes. While {{one end of the}} tubes was closed, the opened one was firstly filled with potassium hydroxide solution leading to its motion by means of a diffusion process once immersed in deionized water (see Figure  4 C) [45]. On the other hand, tubular motors have been reported moving by the surface-induced Marangoni effect for decontaminating phenolic and azo dye compounds. Such motors were based on commercial pipette <b>tips</b> <b>filled</b> with enzyme solution and surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)). The spontaneous release of the mixture once it is {{in the presence of the}} polluted water results in the movement of the motor, which at the same time releases the bioremediation agent and enhances its interaction with the pollutant due to the effective fluid convection related to its motion [54].|$|R

40|$|A {{breeding}} {{program to}} obtain sweet corn (Zea mays L.) hybrids {{adapted to the}} environmental conditions of Galicia (Northwest of Spain) was established in 1976. The program began with populations and elite inbred lines from North America which showed poor early vigor in the usual cold and wet springs of Northwestern Spain. No inbreds {{were obtained from the}} populations. Several crosses were made from the American inbreds and selfed the following years with pedigree selection to produce adapted inbred lines. Five selected hybrids from the new inbreds along with five commercial hybrids and six maturity check hybrids were evaluated in three environments. Hybrids developed in our Institute were better for early vigor and quality ratings, worse for conicalness and ear <b>tip</b> <b>filling</b> and equal to the commercial hybrids for important agronomic traits like silking date, plant and ear height, tillering, and yield characteristics. As a conclusion we suggest that adaptation of sweet corn, specially early vigor, can be improved by pedigree selection for agronomic performance while quality remains constant.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{isolating}} and cloning mRNA populations from individual cells in living, intact plant tissues is described. The contents of individual cells were aspirated into micropipette <b>tips</b> <b>filled</b> with RNA extraction buffer. The mRNA from these cells was purified by binding to oligo(dT) -linked magnetic beads and amplified on the beads using reverse transcription and PCR. The cell-specific {{nature of the}} isolated mRNA was verified by creating cDNA libraries from individual tomato leaf epidermal and guard cell mRNA preparations. In testing the reproducibility of the method, we discovered an inherent limitation of PCR amplification from small amounts of any complex template. This phenomenon, which we have termed the "Monte Carlo" effect, is created by small and random differences in amplification efficiency between individual templates in an amplifying cDNA population. The Monte Carlo effect is dependent upon template concentration: the lower the abundance of any template, the less likely its true abundance will {{be reflected in the}} amplified library. Quantitative assessment of the Monte Carlo effect revealed that only rare mRNAs (< or = 0. 04 % of polyadenylylated mRNA) exhibited significant variation in amplification at the single-cell level. The cDNA cloning approach we describe should be useful for a broad range of cell-specific biological applications...|$|R

40|$|Boron (B) is an {{essential}} micronutrient needed for normal plant growth and development. To evaluate the response of corn to foliar B applications at V 4 –V 6 (4 – 6 leaves with visible collars) and VT (tasseling) growth stages on fine textured soils, a field experiment was conducted at four sites from 2008 to 2010 in Northeast Missouri. The treatments included a non-treated control; V 4 –V 6 applied B at 0. 56, 1. 12 and 2. 24 kg·ha− 1; and VT applied B at 0. 28, 0. 56 and 1. 12 kg·ha− 1. Foliar B, applied at V 4 –V 6 at 2. 24 kg·ha− 1, resulted in higher yields than VT applications. No significant differences in yield were found for B applications at different timings for concentrations of 0. 56 and 1. 12 kg·ha− 1. Boron applied at V 4 –V 6 and 2. 24 kg·ha− 1 increased yield 0. 29 Mg·ha− 1 compared to the non-treated control. The B applications at VT increased ear leaf tissue B concentration compared to V 4 –V 6 applications and non-treated control, but it had no significant effect on corn yields. No significant difference between B treatments was observed for grain oil, protein, starch or extractable starch concentration; severity of anthracnose stalk rot or common rust; and ear <b>tip</b> <b>fill.</b> The B application of 2. 24  kg·ha− 1 at V 4 –V 6 decreased the severity of gray leaf spot, but increased the severity of northern leaf blight compared to the non-treated control.
