40|$|The local defect {{inspection}} in longitudinal {{structures such as}} plates or pipelines implies high economical {{costs and}} it is time consuming mainly in underground infrastructures, energy or water, and aerospace sectors. Moreover, if these structures are non-accessible, their local inspection is not possible. Ultrasonic (US) inspection technique based on guided waves is one of the potential alternatives to address this issue. The US inspection based on these type of waves could be applied in many scenarios to monitor the damage state of structures; i. e., in water underground pipelines to identify the wall <b>thickness</b> <b>losses</b> or impact damage detection on Carbon Fiber Reinforced Composites (CFRC). A SHM system based on guided waves requires a special signal processing in order to identify possible damage in the structure. The signal emitted and received is a combination of different propagation modes which are difficult to identify and analyse. However, if the signals are compared to each other (signal related to non-damaged components compared to damaged signal) it is possible to measure their difference as a distance {{that can be used to}} estimate the damage level. In this work, signals corresponding to non-damaged samples have been captured and then different types of damage have been applied for different cases. After the data acquisition phase, the comparison between signals has been carried out by applying different mathematical methods and distance metrics (SDC, DTW, Euclidean, Manhattan and Chebyshev), with the aim of detecting defects in different structures and materials. For this purpose, two cases have been analysed: 1) In CFRC plates subjected to impact damage and deformations and 2) In a pipe coated by cement-mortar in order to quantify the wall <b>thickness</b> <b>losses.</b> In both cases ultrasonic PZT sensors, an ultrasonic multichannel pulser/receiver and a software developed ad-hoc have been used. Although the SHM system components were similar, it must be noted that the type of ultrasonic guided waves used were different; in the case of CFRC plates, Lamb waves were excited whereas in the case of the pipeline, Love waves have been used. A comparison between the above mentioned methods is provided. The results show the validity of the approach for damage characterization.

40|$|Massive glacier {{thinning}} in the Alps {{during the}} past 20 years is documented by direct mass balance measurements on nine regularly observed glaciers. How representative this limited sample of glaciers is for the entire Alps, however, remained uncertain. The near-global digital terrain model from the SRTM enables a closer analysis of this question, which is of fundamental importance to assess overall glacier volume change. Here we present elevation changes from 1985 to 1999 for about 1050 glaciers in the Swiss Alps. The analysis reveals extreme <b>thickness</b> <b>losses</b> (> 80 m) for flat/low-lying glacier tongues and a strong overall surface lowering. The mean cumulative mass balance of the nine glaciers with direct measurements (− 10. 8 m w. e.) agrees well with the mean change of the entire region from DEM differencing (− 11 m w. e.) and can thus {{be considered to be}} representative. Mean thickness change of individual glaciers is correlated with their size, elevation, and exposure to solar irradiation.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive series of UKAs used in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss in the medial compartment of the knee. Patients and Methods: Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in 90 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss and followed up independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients had partial thickness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full <b>thickness</b> <b>loss</b> on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively). Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1 : 2 based on age, gender and pre-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees with full <b>thickness</b> <b>loss</b> on both the femur and tibia. The functional outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-operations were assessed at one, two and five years post-operatively. A subgroup of 36 knees in 36 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss, who had pre-operative MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors identified on MRI that predicted the outcome. Results: Knees with partial thickness cartilage loss had significantly worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-operatively compared with those with full <b>thickness</b> <b>loss.</b> A quarter of knees with partial <b>thickness</b> <b>loss</b> had a fair or poor result and a fifth failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with full <b>thickness</b> <b>loss.</b> Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between the groups, the rate of re-operation in knees with partial <b>thickness</b> <b>loss</b> was three times higher. Most of the re-operations (three-quarters), were arthroscopies for persistent pain. Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients with partial thickness cartilage loss who achieved fair or poor outcomes were younger and had worse pre-operative functional scores. However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics. MRI findings of full thickness cartilage loss, subchondral oedema, synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information. Conclusion: Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full thickness cartilage loss on both the femur and tibia. Whilst some patients with partial <b>thickness</b> <b>loss</b> achieve a good result we cannot currently identify which these will be and in this situation MRI is unhelpful and misleading...|$|E

40|$|Objective: to {{estimate}} the role of adipose tissue in gestational weight gain (GWG) and preferential fat deposition among normal-weight women. Subjects and methods: prospective cohort study of 84 pregnancies: maternal body mass index 18, 5 – 24, 9 kg/m 2, singleton term pregnancy, nondiabetic women, somatically well. GWG and skinfold thickness were evaluated in the 1 st, 2 nd, 3 d trimesters, on the 3 d day after delivery. Results: fat mass gain in low GWG was similar to recommended GWG and in the high-GWG group was greater one. Women with recommended and low GWG returned to their initial fat level on the 3 d day after delivery, in excessive weight gain fat significantly increased (р= 0, 025). Compared to initial recommended GWG resulted in triceps skinfold <b>thicknesses</b> <b>loss</b> (р= 0, 001), in abdominal skinfold gained nothing and in thighs skinfold thicknesses increasing (р= 0, 021). Inadequate GWG leads to fat loss in arms (р= 0, 017), fat of abdominal area and thighs return to initial level. In excessive GWG fat in the upper trunk and arms not changed, in the lower area (thighs) significantly increased compared to initial level (р= 0, 001) or other groups (р= 0, 001). Conclusion: excessive GWG was associated with greater adipose tissue cumulation and its deposition preferentially over the thighs. Inadequate GWG was clearly linked to low fat-free mass gain...|$|R
