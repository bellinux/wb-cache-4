5|$|Coal {{has been}} mined around Worsley from {{as long ago}} as 1376, {{originally}} in bell pits. The coal seams in the area tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> thin, slanting downwards from north to south, and so deeper mining became necessary during the 17thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The German Type IXA {{submarine}} was a sub-class of the German Type IX submarine {{built for}} Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine between 1937 and 1938. These U-boats were designed between 1935 and 1936 and were intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> large ocean-going submarines. The {{inspiration for the}} Type IXA submarine came from the German Type IA submarine, which had a similar diving depth and identical submerged horsepower.|$|E
5|$|Surface-to-surface missile battalions {{were divided}} into three or four batteries, each {{equipped}} with one missile launcher. They operated thirty FROG-3 and eighteen SCUD missile launchers. The FROG-3, a tactical missile first introduced in 1960, was being replaced in other non-Soviet Warsaw Pact armies. Proven <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> inaccurate in combat, FROG and SCUD missiles would be ineffective weapons carrying conventional high-explosive warheads. Tipped with nuclear or chemical warheads, however, they could be devastating. According to one former Romanian official writing in 1988, Romania produced chemical agents that could be delivered by battlefield missiles.|$|E

5|$|Winds to {{tropical}} storm-force {{were reported}} throughout {{the western part}} of Cuba, with a peak gust of 64mph (102km/h) in Havana. Heavy rainfall of up to 18inches (450mm) was also reported in the area. 32houses were damaged or destroyed due to flooding that resulted. One person was killed in western Cuba and three others were injured. The overall economic loss {{as a result of the}} storm was reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> minor.|$|E
5|$|With the CSBS the {{sighting}} system and calculator {{were the same}} device, which required the bombsight <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> large. With this restriction removed, the sight head was much smaller and lighter than the older versions. The resulting sight head was easy to mount on a stabilizer system, adapted from the same Sperry gyroscope as earlier experiments. With the sight head stabilized, the bomb aimer could continue to measure drift even as he indicated turns to the pilot, eliminating the need to correct, re-measure and correct again. The remote console and second operator eliminated {{the need for the}} bomb aimer to look away from the sights, to make adjustments while on the bomb run. As a result of these changes, short aiming periods of a few seconds would be enough for an accurate drop.|$|E
5|$|Ariel appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> evenly cratered {{compared}} to other moons of Uranus; the relative paucity of large craters suggests that its surface does not date to the Solar System's formation, which means that Ariel must have been completely resurfaced at some point of its history. Ariel's past geologic activity {{is believed to have}} been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently. The largest crater observed on Ariel, Yangoor, is only 78km across, and shows signs of subsequent deformation. All large craters on Ariel have flat floors and central peaks, and few of the craters are surrounded by bright ejecta deposits. Many craters are polygonal, indicating that their appearance was influenced by the preexisting crustal structure. In the cratered plains there are a few large (about 100km in diameter) light patches that may be degraded impact craters. If this is the case they would be similar to palimpsests on Jupiter's moon Ganymede. It has been suggested that a circular depression 245km in diameter located at 10°S 30°E is a large, highly degraded impact structure.|$|E

5|$|Different {{traditions and}} genres of poetry {{tend to use}} {{different}} meters, ranging from the Shakespearean iambic pentameter and the Homeric dactylic hexameter to the anapestic tetrameter used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a caesura (or pause) may be added (sometimes {{in place of a}} foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a feminine ending to soften it or be replaced by a spondee to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular. Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, iambic tetrameter in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.|$|E

In contrast, most Republicans from New York City (such as Rudy Giuliani, Michael Bloomberg, and Fossella's two predecessors, Guy and Susan Molinari) tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> moderate. Although Democrats have a 17-point advantage in registered voters, the Democrats {{in this district}} tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> conservative on social issues.|$|E

25|$|Butanol {{may be used}} as a fuel in an {{internal}} combustion engine. Because its longer hydrocarbon chain causes it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> non-polar, it is more similar to gasoline than it is to ethanol. Butanol has been demonstrated to work in vehicles designed for use with gasoline without modification. It has a four link hydrocarbon chain.|$|E

Drawing on research conducted on 28 separate elections, Miguel Angel Lara Otaola argues that elections not only need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> conducted <b>fairly,</b> {{but that they}} have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> perceived as such.

Textiles are not a straightforward commodity because <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> traded, there must be regulation in cotton cultivation, dyeing, stitching, and every other step in the process of textile production. Fair trade textiles must not be confused with the sweat-free movement although the two movements intersect at the worker level.|$|E

25|$|MERS-CoV is a betacoronavirus {{derived from}} bats. Camels {{have been shown}} to have {{antibodies}} to MERS-CoV but the exact source of infection in camels has not been identified. Camels are believed to be involved in its spread to humans but it is unclear how. Spread between humans typically requires close contact with an infected person. Its spread is uncommon outside of hospitals. Thus, its risk to the global population is currently deemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> low.|$|E
25|$|The German Type IXB {{submarine}} was a sub-class of the German Type IX submarine {{built for}} Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine between 1938 and 1940.

The {{inspiration for the}} Type IXB submarine came from the earlier original Type IX submarine, the Type IXA submarine.

This design was improved even further in the later Type IXC submarines.|$|E

It is reputed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> close to the North Baffin dialect, since a group of migratory Inuit from Baffin Island settled in the area during the 19th and early 20th centuries.
