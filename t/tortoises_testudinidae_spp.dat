50|$|The Emydidae {{are most}} {{closely related to}} the <b>tortoises</b> (<b>Testudinidae)</b> and are {{included}} along with that family in the Testudinoidea. Shared features include a lack of inframarginal scutes, the shape and muscle attachment of the ilium, and the shape of the eighth cervical vertebra (biconvex). Within the Emydidae, two subfamilies were recognized along biogeographic lines. The Emydidae as understood today contain New World species (except Emys), while the former Batagurinae, today a separate family Geoemydidae, contain Old World species (except Rhinoclemmys). Osteological characters, such as the construction of the mandible and articulations of the cervical vertebrae distinguish the two families.|$|R

40|$|Reintroduction {{programs}} of tortoises Lire often implemented for the recovering of natural populations. Introduced animals {{should be free}} of known diseases and pathogens, such ais herpesviruses; these are well known to cause latent infections that may be reactivated under certain conditions. Thus, clinically healthy chelonians may carry and shed herpesviruses, posing a thrat to naive populations. From August 2006 to August 2007, blood and oral swabs were collected from 92 clinically healthy <b>tortoises</b> (<b>Testudinidae),</b> and a serum-neutralization test was performed to detect antibodies against tortoise herpesviruses. Oral samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) {{for the presence of}} the tortoise herpesvirus. Anti-herpesvirus antibodies were detected in 9 % of the tested animals, whereas 16 % of the oral samples were positive for tortoise herpesvirus using PCR. The relatively high percentage of clinically healthy tortoises shedding herpesviruses suggests that, before reintroduction of tortoises, herpesvirus testing should be mandatory and that both serology and PCR should be applied...|$|R

50|$|The {{ability to}} store and {{separate}} sperm from multiple males enables females to manipulate paternity by choosing which sperm fertilize their eggs, {{a process known}} as cryptic female choice. Evidence for this ability exists in many different taxa, including birds, reptiles, gastropods, arachnids, and insects. In combining long-term sperm storage with polyandrous behavior, female members of the <b>tortoise</b> family <b>Testudinidae</b> have access to sperm from a range of genetically different males and can potentially influence a clutch’s paternity during each fertilization event, not just through her mating choices alone. As a result of clutches with greater variation in paternal genes and increased sperm competition, females can maximize both the genetic quality and number of offspring.|$|R
25|$|Many reptile species also {{demonstrate}} polyandry, {{especially among}} members of the <b>tortoise</b> family (<b>Testudinidae).</b> Through polyandry and long-term sperm storage, recent studies have found evidence for the ability of female tortoises to produce clutches of eggs that demonstrate multiple paternity. Predictably, these hatchlings showed an increase in genetic variability compared to those sired by a single male. Potential for multiple paternity within a clutch is primarily a result of sperm storage across reproductive cycles, since studies have confirmed the presence of multiple males' sperm in the female tortoise reproductive tract simultaneously. As a result of clutches with greater variation in paternal genes and increased sperm competition, females can maximize both the genetic quality and number of offspring. Multiple paternities within a single clutch is therefore considered an effective strategy to increase the reproductive success and fitness of female tortoises.|$|R
40|$|This {{identification}} guide {{provides a}} brief {{introduction to the}} star-patterned tortoises potentially encountered by wildlife law enforcement officials. The taxonomy used here follows that currently recognized by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). The emphasis here is on providing a photographic guide to identification, rather than a detailed biological key. The three primary species {{commonly referred to as}} star-patterned <b>tortoises</b> (Family <b>Testudinidae)</b> include the Indian Star Tortoise (Geochelone elegans), the Burmese Star Tortoise (Geochelone platynota), and the Radiated Tortoise (Astrochelys radiata). These three species are emphasized here. There are additional tortoises that may have star-like patterns on their shells. Some, but not all of these are also described or illustrated here. When attempting to identify wildlife species for law enforcement purposes, consultation with an expert is always recommended. For further identification tips and an overview of basic terminology, see Charette (1999) and Ernst and Barbour (1989) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{excessive}} {{collection and}} destruction of their natural biotope are the dominant cause of decrease in free nature occurance, therefore the majority of tortoises were classified in the CITES convention. This theses evalued the trade with madagascan and sub-Saharan <b>tortoises</b> from the <b>Testudinidae</b> family between years 1978 and 2012. The CITES Trade databasis was the main sources of datas. The most imported species were Stigmochelys pardalis, Testudo graeca and Kinixys homeana. These species were the most imported for comercial purposes and as specimens bred in captivity. The most exported species were Stigmochelys pardalis, Testudo graeca and Kinixys homeana again for the comercial purposes and as specimens bred in captivity...|$|R
40|$|Plants evolve {{physical}} defences, such as spines, against browsing herbivores. However, in some cases, these defences may be anachronistic {{because the}} principal consumers of protected {{parts of the}} plant are extinct. In such cases, there may be few extant species consuming heavily defended resources. Here we examine the spiny defences of Madagascar’s endemic Didiereoideae, and ask whether they may be anachronistic. To accomplish this aim, we reviewed the literature to determine which species consume these plants today, and then used stable isotope biogeochemistry to determine who may have exploited Didiereoideae in the recent past. There are four major groups of browsers that are now extinct in Madagascar: giant lemurs, elephant birds (Aepyornis and Mullerornis: Aepyornithidae), pygmy hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus) and giant <b>tortoises</b> (Aldabrachelys: <b>Testudinidae).</b> Each group was evaluated for isotopic evidence of didiereoid plant consumption. Given the structure of members of this plant clade (especially Alluaudia), we predicted that lemurs would be their most important consumers. Three extant lemur species consume Didiereoideae. Several of the extinct lemurs, particularly Hadropithecus stenognathus, may have relied heavily on these spiny plants. None of the non-lemur megafaunal browsers (elephant birds, hippopotamuses and giant tortoises) were important consumers of Didiereoideae...|$|R
40|$|International {{conventions}} dictate reliable {{identification of}} various reptile species which {{are subject to}} intensive trade targeting and habitat destruction. As a rule, tortoises with a minimal plastron length of 100 mm are fitted with a microchip transponder. The development of new generations of transponders, however, may offer the possibility to identify smaller individuals. This study evaluated the use of microchip transponders in juvenile Hermann’s tortoises (Testudo hermanni) using two groups of 30 captive bred tortoises. Microchip transponders were implanted in {{the first group of}} tortoises and the second group served as a control group. During a 10 month observation period, including 2 months of hibernation, both groups were evaluated for short- as well as mid-term effects of microchip implantation, and readability of the microchips was checked twice a week. Body weight and plastron length were determined twice a week to compare growth and weight curves between both groups. Radiographs were obtained from all animals immediately following microchip implantation, 4 weeks later, {{and at the end of}} the observation period. In addition, applicability and readability of the marking method were evaluated in 130 <b>tortoises</b> (family <b>Testudinidae)</b> and 73 turtles (family Emydidae) with a plastron length exceeding 100 mm. Besides overall uncomplicated application and excellent readability, our results provide a solid basis for the assumption that the use of microchip transponders do not result in negative behavioral or physical effects and are safe to use in juvenile Hermann’s tortoises, allowing at least mid-term identification of tagged individuals...|$|R
40|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1970 s, ecologists began {{unraveling}} the role of recently extinct large vertebrates in evolutionary ecology and ecosystem dynamics. Three decades later, practitioners are now considering the role of ecological history in conservation practice, and some have called for restoring missing ecological functions and evolutionary potential using taxon substitutes - extant, functionally similar taxa - to replace extinct species. This pro-active approach to biodiversity conservation has proved controversial. Yet, rewilding with taxon substitutes, or ecological analogues, is now being integrated into conservation and restoration programmes around the world. Empirical evidence is emerging that illustrates how taxon substitutions can restore missing ecological functions and evolutionary potential. However, a major roadblock to a broader evaluation and application of taxon substitution {{is the lack of}} practical guidelines within which they should be conducted. While the International Union for Conservation of Nature 2 ̆ 7 s reintroduction guidelines are an obvious choice, they are unsuitable in their current form. We recommend necessary amendments to these guidelines to explicitly address taxon substitutions. A second impediment to empirical evaluations of rewilding with taxon substitutions is the sheer scale of some proposed projects; the majority involves large mammals over large areas. We present and discuss evidence that large and giant <b>tortoises</b> (family <b>Testudinidae)</b> are a useful model to rapidly provide empirical assessments of the use of taxon substitutes on a comparatively smaller scale. Worldwide, at least 36 species of large and giant tortoises went extinct since the late Pleistocene, leaving 32 extant species. We examine the latent conservation potential, benefits, and risks of using tortoise taxon substitutes as a strategy for restoring dysfunctional ecosystems. We highlight how, especially on islands, conservation practitioners are starting to employ extant large tortoises in ecosystems to replace extinct tortoises that once played keystone roles. © 2010 The Authors.

40|$|We {{developed}} and optimized a simple, efficient and inexpensive method for in vitro culture of peripheral blood lymphocytes from the Brazilian <b>tortoise</b> Chelonoidis carbonaria (<b>Testudinidae),</b> testing various parameters, including culture medium, mitogen concentration, mitotic index, culture volume, incubation time, and mitotic arrest. Peripheral blood samples {{were obtained from}} the costal vein of four couples. The conditions that gave a good mitotic index were lymphocytes cultured at 37 °C in minimum essential medium (7. 5 mL), with phytohemagglutinin as a mitogen (0. 375 mL), plus streptomycin/penicillin (0. 1 mL), and an incubation period of 72 h. Mitotic arrest was induced by 2 -h exposure to colchicine (0. 1 mL), 70 h after establishing the culture. After mitotic arrest, the cells were hypotonized with 0. 075 M KCl for 2 h and fixed with methanol/acetic acid (3 : 1). The non-banded mitotic chromosomes were visualized by Giemsa staining. The diploid chromosome number of C. carbonaria was found to be 52 in females and males, and sex chromosomes were not observed. We were able to culture peripheral blood lymphocytes of a Brazilian tortoise in vitro, for the preparation of mitotic chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|Background. Just as {{for most}} other {{tortoise}} species, the once common Chaco <b>tortoise,</b> Chelonoidis chilensis (<b>Testudinidae),</b> is under constant threat across it distribution in Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay. Despite initial qualitative {{description of the}} species distribution and further individual reports of new locations for the species, there is no description of the species distribution in probabilistic terms. With this work we aim to produce an updated predictive distribution map for C. chilensis {{to serve as a}} baseline management tool for directed strategic conservation planning. Methods. We fitted a spatially expanded logistic regression model within the Bayesian framework that accounts for uncertainty on presence-only and generated pseudo-absence data into the parameter estimates. We contrast the results with reported data for the national networks of protected areas to assess the inclusion of the species in area-based conservation strategies. Results. We obtained maps with predictions of the occurrence of the species and reported the model’s uncertainty spatially. The model suggests that potential suitable habitats for the species are continuous across Argentina, West Paraguay and South Bolivia, considering the variables, the scale and the resolution used. The main limiting variables were temperature-related variables, and precipitation in the reproductive period. Discussion. Given the alarming low density and coverage of protected areas over the distribution area of C. chilensis, the map produced provides a baseline to identify areas where directed strategic conservation management actions would be more efficient for this and other associated species...|$|R
