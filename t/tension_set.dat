5000|$|... #Caption: This table compares {{different}} sub-families of TPE, ranking {{their performance}} compared {{to each other}} as excellent, good, fair or poor. It demonstrates that TPV offers a combination of elastomeric properties, like compression and <b>tension</b> <b>set,</b> coupled with aging performance and chemical resistance. In addition to a relatively low density (or specific gravity), TPVs can be used to reduce the weight of flexible systems and parts.|$|E
50|$|A major {{difference}} between tension settings and other settings is that tension settings are only manufactured after they are sold while other settings are often manufactured first and then sold to consumers. There are several reasons for this difference. First, tension settings can not be resized easily as resizing them will remove the spring-loading effect. In cases they can be resized up or down up to 2 sizes but does depend on the design in question. A {{lot of the time}} instead of resizing a <b>tension</b> <b>setting,</b> the manufacturer actually has to melt down the old setting and create a new spring-loaded <b>tension</b> <b>setting</b> that is appropriately sized. Second, tension settings are calibrated to the exact specifications of the stone that they will hold, therefore they can not be manufactured until the customer has selected the gem that will go inside. Unlike other settings which can be manufactured ahead of time regardless of the stone that will ultimately be placed inside, each <b>tension</b> <b>setting</b> is designed specifically for the stone it will hold. The <b>tension</b> <b>setting</b> is calibrated by a computer using light to identify the exact places where pressure must be applied on the gemstone in order to avoid fracturing it through even pressure distribution.|$|R
5000|$|Because tension {{settings}} place such {{pressure on}} the stone, only four types of gemstone can {{be placed in a}} <b>tension</b> <b>setting</b> safely: diamonds, rubies, moissanite,and sapphires. Additionally, <b>tension</b> <b>setting</b> manufacturers must be careful which stones they place in tension settings; a stone that either has significant inclusions or is too soft will fracture under the intense pressure of the setting. The Mohs scale is a reliable way to rank a gem's hardness; generally gems that have a Mohs hardness of less than 9.0 cannot be placed in the setting.|$|R

The key factor in these operations is <b>tension</b> <b>setting</b> of the tendon transfer. In this article, we retrospectively reviewed our extensor indicis proprius (EIP) to EPL transfer cases for chronic EPL ruptures. Methods: Five patients were operated on for chronic rupture of the EPL tendon between December of 2011 and April of 2014. The EIP tendon {{was transferred to the}} EPL tendon using the wide-awake approach in order to optimally <b>set</b> the <b>tension.</b> Results: All five patients were able to extend their thumbs.

5000|$|The {{original}} Niessing tension {{ring was}} constructed out of 18 karat gold (75% pure gold and 25% other alloying metals) and weighed 35 grams.

In 1987, Steven Kretchmer patented a proprietary platinum alloy called [...] "Plat/SK". This has since been licensed to other companies, for example Hoover & Strong, who require a super hard platinum alloy for jewelry such as <b>tension</b> <b>set</b> rings. Steven Kretchmer's advancements in the alloying of metals allowed the modern day tension ring to lose much of its weight without sacrificing strength.|$|E
