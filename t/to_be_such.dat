5|$|The third {{industrial}} revolution is spreading from {{the developed world}} to some, but not all, parts of the developing world. To participate in this new global economy, developing countries {{must be seen as}} attractive offshore production bases for multinational corporations. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> bases, developing countries must provide relatively well-educated workforces, good infrastructure (electricity, telecommunications, transportation), political stability, and a willingness to play by market rules.|$|E

Fifteen-year-old Sem Veeger, lead actress in the film Keep Off (2006), said she knew that many people had seen the film, but she did not expect it to receive a Golden Film.|$|E
5|$|Tory leaders {{scheduled}} a leadership convention for December. In early November, the Suez crisis erupted. Minister of External Affairs Lester Pearson {{played a major}} part in the settlement of that dispute, and was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role. Diefenbaker, as the Tories' foreign policy critic and as the favourite in the leadership race, gained considerable attention for his speeches on Suez. The Tories attacked Pearson for, as they said, being an errand boy for the United States government; he responded {{that it was better}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a lackey than to be an obedient colonial doing Britain's will unquestioningly. While Suez would come to be regarded by many as one of the finest moments in Canadian foreign policy, at the time it cost the Liberals support outside of Quebec.|$|E

25|$|While {{adhering}} {{to the death penalty}} by beheading as punishment for homosexuality or adultery, Justinian's legal novels heralded a change in Roman legal paradigm in that he introduced a concept of not only secular but also divine punishment for homosexual behavior.

25|$|Many Christians pretended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> while {{continuing}} pagan practices, and many converted back to paganism; numerous laws against apostasy kept being promulgated and penalties increased {{since the time}} of Gratian and Theodosius. pagans were openly voicing their resentment in historical works, like the writings of Eunapius and Olympiodorus, and books blaming the Christian egemony for the 410 Sack of Rome. Christians destroyed almost all such pagan political literature, and threatened copyists with the cutting of their hands.|$|E

Thucydides mentions the Acarnanians and Livy refers to the inhabitants of three Greek cities on the northern coast of the Peloponnesus as expert slingers.

His father was killed in 1023, probably on the orders of his half-brother Donnchad mac Briain who thereby made himself king of Munster. Donnchad, while he successfully retained control of Munster for four decades, was never able to achieve the same success as Brian. Epigraphic evidence shows that he aimed to be king of Ireland, and perhaps considered himself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>such,</b> but the annalists and later historians recognised no such pretensions.|$|E
