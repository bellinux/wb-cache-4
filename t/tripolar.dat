5000|$|Errors {{can occur}} during mitosis, {{especially}} during early embryonic development in humans. Mitotic errors can create aneuploid cells that have too few or {{too many of}} one or more chromosomes, a condition associated with cancer. [...] Early human embryos, cancer cells, infected or intoxicated cells can also suffer from pathological division into three or more daughter cells (<b>tripolar</b> or multipolar mitosis), resulting in severe errors in their chromosomal complements.|$|E
50|$|The {{biotechnology}} {{and pharmaceutical}} industries experienced strong {{growth in the}} late 1980s. Pharmaceutical production grew an estimated 8 percent in 1989 because of increased expenditures by Japan's rapidly aging population. Leading producers actively developed new drugs, such as those for degenerative and geriatric diseases. Pharmaceutical companies were establishing <b>tripolar</b> networks connecting Japan, the United States, and Western Europe to co-ordinate product development. They also increased merger and acquisition activity overseas. Biotechnology research and development was progressing steadily, including the launching of marine biotechnology projects, with full-scale commercialization expected {{to take place in}} the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|Self psychology, {{a modern}} psychoanalytic theory and its {{clinical}} applications, was conceived by Heinz Kohut in Chicago in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, {{and is still}} developing as a contemporary form of psychoanalytic treatment. In self psychology, the effort is made to understand individuals from within their subjective experience via vicarious introspection, basing interpretations on {{the understanding of the}} self as the central agency of the human psyche. Essential to understanding self psychology are the concepts of empathy, selfobject, mirroring, idealising, alter ego/twinship and the <b>tripolar</b> self. Though self psychology also recognizes certain drives, conflicts, and complexes present in Freudian psychodynamic theory, these are understood within a different framework. Self psychology was seen as a major break from traditional psychoanalysis and is considered the beginnings of the relational approach to psychoanalysis.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} mitosis {{is divided into}} stages {{corresponding}} to the completion of one set of activities {{and the start of}} the next. These stages are prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. During mitosis, the chromosomes, which have already duplicated, condense and attach to spindle fibers that pull one copy of each chromosome to opposite sides of the cell. The result is two genetically identical daughter nuclei. The rest of the cell may then continue to divide by cytokinesis to produce two daughter cells. Producing three or more daughter cells instead of normal two is a mitotic error called <b>tripolar</b> mitosis or multipolar mitosis (direct cell triplication / multiplication). Other errors during mitosis can induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) or cause mutations. Certain types of cancer can arise from such mutations.|$|E
50|$|Anaplastic cells display marked pleomorphism (variability). The nuclei are {{characteristically}} extremely hyperchromatic (darkly stained) and large. The nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio may approach 1:1 {{instead of}} the normal 1:4 or 1:6. Giant cells that are considerably larger than their neighbors may be formed and possess either one enormous nucleus or several nuclei (syncytia). Anaplastic nuclei are variable and bizarre in size and shape. The chromatin is coarse and clumped, and nucleoli may be of astounding size. More important, mitoses are often numerous and distinctly atypical; anarchic multiple spindles may be seen and sometimes appear as <b>tripolar</b> or quadripolar forms. Also, anaplastic cells usually fail to develop recognizable patterns of orientation to one another (i.e., they lose normal polarity). They may grow in sheets, with total loss of communal structures, such as gland formation or stratified squamous architecture. Anaplasia is the most extreme disturbance in cell growth encountered in the spectrum of cellular proliferations.|$|E
50|$|Pandanus utilis is a palm-like {{evergreen}} tree, {{ranging in}} height up to 20 m. They {{are found in}} tropical areas and have an upright trunk that is smooth with many horizontal spreading branches with annular leaf scars. Old leaf scars spiral around the branches and trunk, like a screw. The anatomy of Pandanaceae stems can be distinguished from other monocotyledons {{by the presence of}} a compound vascular bundle. This bi- or <b>tripolar</b> vascular bundle has two or three distinct conduction strands encased by a common bundle sheath. At the end of each branch is a spiral cluster of long, linear leaves with a pectinate (comb-like) edge tapering to a long point at the apex. This margin is filled with small reddish colored teeth. The leaves are simple without lobes and can be up to 2 m long and 3 to 11 cm broad. They are without petioles and are broadly clasped at the base. The leaf venation is parallel running longitudinal. The blue/green to dark green leaves is rather stiff with a waxy texture. The leaves of P. utilis have a spongy tissue with numerous fibers arranged in bundles. These bundles can contain over 150 fibers.|$|E

50|$|Meiospore {{germination}} {{is usually}} bipolar or <b>tripolar</b> and they develop into densely branched thread-like microthalli. The filaments are 10-15gm in diameter in both species. Growth {{is the result}} of both terminal and intercalary(located between its daughter cells) cell divisions, and in older microthalli longitudinal intercalary divisions are common. The cells contain a star-shaped chloroplast having a typical pyrenoid. The way microthalli will develops depend on the conditions in which they are cultured. Prior to gametogenesis the vegetative cells of the gametophyte contained a number of large vesicles. Several changes occur following the onset of gametogenesis. In the cytoplasm, smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) became noticeable and the number of membrane-bound electron-dense (possibly lipid) bodies increased. At a later stage these bodies accumulated in the vesicles. There is a single Golgi body in the cell which appears to be closely linked with the vesicles. The transition to the next stage is marked by the shrinking of the cytoplasm away from the cell wall. Following this, flagella appear within cytoplasmic vesicles and the paired centrioles of the vegetative cells take on the function of basal bodies (organelles that form the base of a flagellum or cilium). The flagella gains mastigonemes and takes up an external position. At the same time the volume of extracellular material increases. The Golgi body at this stage occupies a position next to the developing flagella and the vesicles with the Golgi body contain a noticeable core of electron-dense material. An eyespot develops in the chloroplast which had retained its star-shape throughout gametogenesis. The internal walls of the gametangium then dissolve and the contents are expelled into the sea-water.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} accepted, among {{political}} scientists at least, that Italy's so-called ‘First Republic’ (c. 1946 – 1994) had a <b>tripolar</b> party system while the ‘Second Republic’ has had, {{at least until}} 2008, a fragmented bipolar one. A superior conceptualisation of the party system of the ‘First Republic’ was provided by Paolo Farneti, and it remains relevant both for {{a better understanding of}} the current party system and for exploring party system dynamics, particularly the relationship between structure and agency in such dynamics. Farneti synthesised Sartori's 1976 analysis of <b>tripolar</b> mechanics with Galli's equally famous analysis of the party system (as one of ‘imperfect bipartism’) in terms of the coexistence of a subordinate bipolar dynamic and a dominant <b>tripolar</b> one. This article argues that the dynamics of the party system in the ‘Second Republic’, or at least the transition to it, can be conceptualised in terms of a dominant bipolar dynamic and a subordinate, <b>tripolar</b> one.

40|$|International audienceAIMS: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} any benefits to the number of viable pacing vectors and maximal spatial coverage with quadripolar left ventricular (LV) leads when compared with <b>tripolar</b> and bipolar equivalents in patients receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). METHODS AND RESULTS: A meta-analysis of five previously published clinical trials involving the Quartet™ LV lead (St Jude Medical, St Paul, MN, USA) was performed to evaluate the number of viable pacing vectors defined as capture thresholds ≤ 2. 5 V and no phrenic nerve stimulation and maximal spatial coverage of viable vectors in CRT patients at pre-discharge (n = 370) and first follow-up (n = 355). Bipolar and <b>tripolar</b> lead configurations were modelled by systematic elimination of two and one electrode(s), respectively, from the Quartet lead. The Quartet lead with its four pacing electrodes exhibited the greatest number of pacing vectors per patient when compared with the best bipolar and the best <b>tripolar</b> modelled equivalents. Similarly, the Quartet lead provided the highest spatial coverage in terms of the distance between two furthest viable pacing cathodes when compared with the best bipolar and the best <b>tripolar</b> configurations (P 0. 05). Among the three modelled bipolar configurations, the lead configuration with the two most distal electrodes resulted in the highest number of viable pacing vectors. Among the four modelled <b>tripolar</b> configurations, elimination of the second proximal electrode (M 3) resulted in the highest number of viable pacing options per patient. There were no significant differences observed between pre-discharge and first follow-up analyses. CONCLUSION: The Quartet lead with its four electrodes and the capability to pace from four anatomical locations provided the highest number of viable pacing vectors at pre-discharge and first follow-up visits, providing more flexibility in device programming and enabling continuation of CRT in more patients when compared with bipolar and <b>tripolar</b> equivalent...|$|E
