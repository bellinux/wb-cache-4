25|$|High Castleton {{had been}} a part of the Robertland Estate and was farmed by William Smith and his spouse Jessie Gibson in the late 18th century. William died aged 83 on 14 December 1913, whilst Jessie died aged 64 on 7 April 1895. They were both buried at the Laigh Kirk, Stewarton. The fields between the Law Mount and Laigh Castleton were known by <b>the</b> <b>quaint</b> names of East and West Tinkerdyke Parks.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{historic}} parts of the town is <b>the</b> <b>quaint</b> and beautiful Westoe village, which consists of a quiet street of 1st grade and 2nd grade Georgian and Victorian houses, many {{of which had been}} built by business leaders from the coal and shipping industries in the town. Given its beautiful setting, parks and trees, this street was often the setting for a number of books by the novelist Catherine Cookson.|$|E

25|$|Charles Kickham was {{the author}} of three {{well-known}} stories, dealing sympathetically with Irish life and manners and the simple faith, the joys and sorrows, <b>the</b> <b>quaint</b> customs and the insuppressible humour of the peasantry. “Knocknagow,” or “The Homes of Tipperary,” one of the finest tales of peasant life ever written, suggests O’Sullivan. “Sally Cavanagh,” or “The Untenanted Graves,” a touching story illustrating the evils of landlordism and emigration; and “For the Old Land,” dealing with the fortunes of a small farmer’s family, with its lights and shades.|$|E
25|$|A few {{kilometers}} to {{the north}} of Alcobaça is another wondrous building constructed in memory of a different important battle, that of Aljubarrota in 1385, when Dom João I of Portugal defeated the Castilians and ensuring two hundred years of independence from the Castilian invaders. The construction of the Abbey at Batalha commenced in 1388 and was added to by various Portuguese Kings over these next two centuries. To the east of Batalha is the world-famous location of Fátima and a point of pilgrimage for the Roman Catholic religion due to the vision of the Virgin Mary in 1917 by three young children whilst tending their flock. To the west of Alcobaça is the well-known fishing village of Nazaré. Today, the village is now a small town and a popular holiday resort with most of its past and traditions having rapidly evaporated in the course of time. A very successful Portuguese feature film was made in the early 20th century that dramatically captured the primitive and dangerous life of these fishermen. Stoutly Catholic, the inhabitants have retained some of their past as can be still seen in their own particular style of costume. To the south is Caldas da Rainha and <b>the</b> <b>quaint</b> medieval town of Óbidos that is an attraction for any tourists that enjoys a true glimpse of the past. Also to the south is the town of Porto de Mós with its fanciful rebuilt castle. This town borders the Nature Reserve Parque Natural das Serras de Aire e Candeeiros. These 390 square kilometres of limestone-covered landscape is also known for its underground caverns. The best known being the Grutas de Mira de Aire can be visited and consists of tunnels, caverns with stalactites, stalagmites, lakes, and a music and light finale.|$|E

[...] The notion of having animals shed their skins for laundering provides opportunities for amusing illustrations, but the tale {{does not have a}} strong narrative line to hold it together or to grip the reader's attention.

David Bowers stated that [...] "the shallow relief of Barber's work is but a travesty of Krider's {{extremely}} detailed high-relief artistry". According to Don Taxay, [...] "When one compares Barber's portraits to those by Du Vivier [...] and Caunois, it is clear why [...] Saint-Gaudens used to refer contemptuously to the 'commercial medalists of the Mint'. [...] The difference here is not merely in the relief, but in elementary modeling skill." [...] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that, [...] "the Lafayette dollar lacks <b>the</b> <b>quaint,</b> dated appeal of the Isabella quarter or the amusing originality of the Columbian half-dollar. [...] Despite the necessity for low relief the jugate busts are too linear. The reverse suffers from too much lettering of uniform size. [...] The words 'Paris 1900' might have been enough; at most, the addition of 'From the Youth of the United States' would have conveyed the matter." ...|$|E

Some of the tracks planned for Tupelo Honey did appear on the album, [...] but other more traditional country songs like [...] "The Wild Side of Life", [...] "Crying Time" [...] and [...] "Banks of the Ohio" [...] were abandoned. Morrison decided to move from Woodstock when the lease on his house expired and the landlord wanted to move back in. He explained to Richard Williams in Melody Maker that {{the release of the}} documentary film, Woodstock, in 1970 had altered <b>the</b> <b>quaint</b> character of the [...] community: [...] "Everybody and his uncle started showing up at the bus station, and that was the complete opposite of what it was supposed to be." [...] In April 1971, before he began recording on the planned album, [...] Morrison and his family moved to Marin County, California, where his wife Janet Planet had family living close by. Morrison's guitarist at the time, John Platania, told biographer Steve Turner that Morrison [...] "didn't want to leave, but Janet wanted to move out West. He was manipulated into going." [...] The Morrisons' new home was in a rural setting situated on a hillside close to San Francisco amid redwood trees. With the move, Morrison abandoned the idea of a full country album and exchanged some of the intended material for songs he had written earlier.|$|E

Challoner was the author over the years of numerous controversial and devotional works, which have been frequently reprinted and translated into various languages. In 1740 he brought out a new prayer book for the laity, the Garden of the Soul, which until the mid 20th century remained a favourite work of devotion, though the many editions that have since appeared have been [...] so altered that little of the original work remains.|$|E
