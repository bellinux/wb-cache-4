Despite various {{research}} efforts on microRNAs, how microRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> are transcriptionally regulated {{and how the}} transcriptional regulation of microRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> relates {{to that of the}} microRNA genes are not well studied. By investigating the transcriptional regulation of microRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes,</b> we found that different groups of <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> of the same microRNA are co-expressed under different conditions, and these groups rarely overlap with each other for the majority of microRNAs. We also discovered that co-expressed microRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> are often co-regulated, and different groups of <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> of the same microRNA are often regulated differently. In addition, we observed that transcription factors regulating a microRNA gene often regulate its <b>target</b> <b>genes.</b> Our study sheds light on the regulation of microRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes,</b> which will facilitate the prediction of microRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> and the understanding of the transcriptional regulation of microRNA genes...|$|R

25|$|Following λ-red operon {{activity}} induction, a linear, double-stranded cassette encoding a selectable marker, such as antibiotic resistance, {{is transformed}} into the cells {{in place of the}} <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> and incorporated into the DNA behind a specific inducible promoter. This allows for growth selection of the recombinant cells with proper insertion location verified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific incorporation can be achieved by including flanking PCR primers around the inserted linear DNA that are complement to the targeted insertion site. After selection of the recombinants, a second transformation is needed to remove the selective marker. A plasmid expressing flippase (FLP) can be transformed into the recombined cells, which can specifically cleave FLP recognition target sites (FRTs) flanking the antibiotic resistance gene. While this successfully removes the selective marker from the genome, it leaves FRT scars in place of the <b>target</b> <b>gene.</b>|$|E

50|$|Discrete <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> {{respond to}} {{different}} thresholds of morphogen activity. The expression of <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> {{is controlled by}} segments of DNA called 'enhancers' to which transcription factors bind directly. Once bound, the transcription factor then stimulates or inhibits the transcription of the gene and thus controls the level of expression of the gene product (usually a protein). 'Low-threshold' <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> require only low levels of morphogen activity to be regulated and feature enhancers that contain many high-affinity binding sites for the transcription factor. 'High-threshold' <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> have relatively fewer binding sites or low-affinity binding sites that require much greater levels of transcription factor activity to be regulated.|$|R

Specifically, the type I receptor, activated by the type II receptor, phosphorylates R-SMADs that then bind to the co-SMAD, SMAD4.

40|$|Enhancers {{are short}} {{regulatory}} regions (50 - 1500 bp) of DNA {{that control the}} tissue-specific activation of gene expression by long distance interaction with <b>targeting</b> <b>gene</b> regions. Recently, genome-wide identification of enhancers in diverse tissues and cell lines was achieved using high-throughput sequencing. Enhancers {{have been associated with}} malfunctions in cancer development resulting from point mutations in regulatory regions. However, the potential impact of copy number variations (CNVs) on enhancer regions is unknown. To learn more about the relationship between enhancers and cancer, we integrated the CNVs data on enhancers and explored their <b>targeting</b> <b>gene</b> expression pattern in high-grade ovarian cancer. Using human enhancer-gene interaction data with 13, 691 interaction pairs between 7, 905 enhancers and 5, 297 <b>targeting</b> <b>genes,</b> we found that the 2, 910 copy number gain events of enhancer are significantly correlated with the up-regulation of <b>targeting</b> <b>genes.</b> We further identified that a number of highly mutated superenhancers, with concordant gene expression change on their <b>targeting</b> <b>genes.</b> We also identified 18 <b>targeting</b> <b>genes</b> by super-enhancers with prognostic significance for ovarian cancer, such as the tumour suppressor CDKN 1 B.

40|$|Abstract Background microRNAs (miRNAs) are {{believed}} to regulate their <b>targets</b> through posttranscriptional <b>gene</b> regulation and {{have the potential to}} silence gene expression via multiple mechanisms. Despite previous advances on miRNA regulation of gene expression, little has been investigated from a genome scale. Results To gain new insight into miRNA regulation in humans, we used large scale data and carried out a series of studies to compare various features of miRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> to that of non-miRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes.</b> We observed significant differences between miRNA and non-miRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> for a number of characteristics, including higher and broader mRNA expression, faster mRNA decay rate, longer protein half-life, and longer gene structures. Based on these features and by analyzing their relationships we found that miRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes,</b> other than having miRNA repression, were most likely under more complex regulation than non-miRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes,</b> which was evidenced by their higher and broader gene expression but longer gene structures. Our results of higher and broader gene expression but fast mRNA decay rates also provide evidence that miRNA dampening of the output of preexisting transcripts facilitates a more rapid and robust transition to new expression programs. This could be achieved by enhancing mRNA degradation through an additive effect from multiple miRNA targeting. Conclusion Genome-scale analysis on the nature of miRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> has revealed a general mechanism for miRNA regulation of human gene expression. The results of this study also indicate that miRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes,</b> other than having miRNA repression, are under more complex gene regulation than non-miRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes.</b> These findings provide novel insight into miRNA regulation of human gene expression. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{transforming}} {{growth factor}} beta (TGFB) {{signaling pathway is}} involved in many cellular processes in both the adult organism and the developing embryo including cell growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, cellular homeostasis and other cellular functions.

TGFβ superfamily ligands bind to a type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates a type I receptor. The type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs) which can now bind the coSMAD SMAD4. R-SMAD/coSMAD complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the regulation of <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> expression.|$|E

40|$|The nuclear {{receptor}} DAF- 12 has {{roles in}} normal development, {{the decision to}} pursue dauer development in unfavorable conditions, and the modulation of adult aging. Despite the biologic importance of DAF- 12, <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> for this receptor are largely unknown. To identify DAF- 12 targets, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to whole-genome tiling arrays. We identified 1, 175 genomic regions to be bound in vivo by DAF- 12, and these regions are enriched in known DAF- 12 binding motifs and act as DAF- 12 response elements in transfected cells and in transgenic worms. The DAF- 12 <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> near these binding sites include an extensive network of interconnected heterochronic and microRNA genes.

However, {{little is known about}} convergent SNS, HPA and inflammatory signaling {{at the level of the}} immune cell transcriptome in PTSD. To explore such signaling, we examined the prevalence of specific transcription factor binding motifs in the promoter regions of differentially expressed genes in monocytes from individuals with PTSD and matched controls. Participants included 49 men (24 PTSD+ and 25 trauma-exposed controls) and 18 women (10 PTSD+ and 8 controls).
