500|$|In June 2012, {{news outlets}} and music journalists from pre-release {{listening}} events for Channel Orange {{raised questions about}} certain songs' lyrics and Ocean's sexuality. The lyrics addressed a male object of love and deviated from the heterosexual perspective of his past songs. Scrapping his original plan of including it in the album's liner notes, Ocean published a TextEdit file as an open letter through his Tumblr blog on July 4. Originally written in December 2011, it recounted his unrequited feelings for a man when he was 19 years old, citing the experience as his first love. Ocean's disclosure was received with support from Def Jam and praise from other recording artists and cultural commentators. He also remarked on writing Channel Orange after years of emotional struggle with the experience, stating in the letter, [...] "I wrote to keep myself busy and sane. I wanted to create worlds that were rosier <b>than</b> <b>mine.</b> I tried to channel overwhelming emotions." ...|$|E

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for Commit This to Memory, which were booked by Hoppus, were scheduled over six weeks at Seedy Underbelly Studios in Valley Village, a district of Los Angeles, California, which {{was actually a}} rented house that had once belonged to Jeff Porcaro, the drummer for Toto. The band had, according to Hoppus, [...] "a million ideas {{and a lot of}} energy and enthusiasm to make a great record". Pierre strove for the record to have a sound that resembled the bands Braid, Superchunk, Jawbox and the Pixies. Living in a suburb, the neighbors had called police to the band and Hoppus several times for being too loud at night time, especially when Hoppus brought a Roland TR-808 drum machine outside to work on a song late at night. According to Pierre, Hoppus was not interested in putting his own stamp on the music, but rather bringing out the best in what he saw in the group. Hoppus generally modeled his production after Jerry Finn (a longtime producer of Blink-182), and therefore it involved much watching and listening. [...] "Mark kept telling us, 'Your name {{is going to be a}} lot bigger on the front <b>than</b> <b>mine</b> is on the back'," [...] recalled Justin Pierre, [...] "So he would throw suggestions out there but always say, 'Feel free to turn these down.' And we would!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Technically, Degas {{differs from}} the Impressionists in that he {{continually}} belittled their practice of painting en plein air. [...] "He was often as anti-impressionist as the critics who reviewed the shows", according to art historian Carol Armstrong; as Degas himself explained, [...] "no art was ever less spontaneous <b>than</b> <b>mine.</b> What I do {{is the result of}} reflection and of the study of the great masters; of inspiration, spontaneity, temperament, I know nothing." [...] Nonetheless, he is described more accurately as an Impressionist than as a member of any other movement. His scenes of Parisian life, his off-center compositions, his experiments with color and form, and his friendship with several key Impressionist artists—most notably Mary Cassatt and Édouard Manet—all relate him intimately to the Impressionist movement.|$|E

He has also spoken of his distrust of another Doctor when his name [...] "sounded too foreign", telling the audience at a Biblically themed amusement park [...] "My mind immediately started thinking, wait a minute, maybe his religious persuasion is different <b>than</b> <b>mine!</b> She [...] could see the look on my face and she said, 'Don't worry, Mr. Cain, he's a Christian from Lebanon'.

2500|$|Rabbi Bradley Artson, Dean of the Rabbinic School at American Jewish University, {{claims to}} have studied every {{reference}} he could find to homosexual activity mentioned in ancient Greek and Latin writers.

Rabbi Artson {{could not find a}} single example where one partner was not subservient to the other. [...] "Homosexual relationships today," [...] Rabbi Artson says, [...] "should not be compared to the ancient world. I know too many homosexual individuals, including close friends and relatives, who are committed to one another in loving long-term monogamous relationships.

2500|$|In 1932 Smoky Dawson {{worked at}} a tannery and on {{weekends}} he played a lap steel guitar in a duo, The Coral Island Boys, with his younger brother, Ted, on Spanish guitar. Both sang lead vocals, with Ted's singing described by Dawson as [...] "a much richer voice <b>than</b> <b>mine.</b> He had more depth in his voice". They performed then-popular songs, such as [...] "Gee But I'm Lonesome for You Caroline" [...] and [...] "Southern Moon Keep on Shining". In 1934, Dawson formed a Western group with an accordionist, a bass guitarist, and Malcolm on violin; which cut a test acetate at Fidelity Records with Jack Murray recording. It was the first professional use of Dawson's nickname, [...] "Smoky" [...] – he had tried pipe smoking when living at Stewarton but it had sickened him. The recording led to sponsorship by Pepsodent – a toothpaste company – and so the group were named, Smoky and the Pepsodent Rangers. In 1935 {{they were the first}} Western group to be broadcast live on an Australian radio station, 3KZ, and by 1937 Dawson had his own radio show. His show was re-broadcast into New South Wales on 2CH as [...] "Hill-billy Artists" [...] by [...] "Smoky" [...] Dawson and His Boys. In 1941, he signed with Columbia Records, where he recorded his first commercial releases, including [...] "I'm a Happy Go Lucky Cowhand" [...] and [...] "The Range in the Western Sky".

5000|$|Mining thorium {{is safer}} and more {{efficient}} <b>than</b> <b>mining</b> uranium. Thorium's ore monazite generally contains higher concentrations of thorium than the percentage of uranium found in its respective ore.

2500|$|Gonzales, who is {{considered}} to be among the greatest tennis players of all time, always maintained that Hoad was the toughest, most skilful adversary that he had ever faced. [...] "He was the only guy who, if I was playing my best tennis, could still beat me." [...] said Gonzales in a 1995 New York Times interview. [...] "I think his game was the best game ever. Better <b>than</b> <b>mine.</b> He was capable of making more shots than anybody. His two volleys were great. His overhead was enormous. He had the most natural tennis mind with the most natural tennis physique." [...] In a 1970 interview he stated that [...] "Hoad was probably the best and toughest player when he wanted to be. After the first two years on the tour, his back injury plagued him so much that he lost the desire to practice. He was the only man to beat me in a head-to-head tour, 15 to 13." [...] Kramer, however, had mixed feelings about Hoad's ability. In spite of calling him one of the 21 best players of all time, he also writes that [...] "when you sum Hoad up, you have {{to say that he was}} overrated. He might have been the best, but day-to-day, week-to-week, he was the most inconsistent of all the top players." [...] In a 1963 article in World Tennis Rosewall judges Gonzales to be a notch above Hoad but stated that [...] "...the latter is the greatest of all time when he is 'on'.", an opinion echoed by Frew McMillan.|$|E
