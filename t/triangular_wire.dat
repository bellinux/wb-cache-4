40|$|Superconducting {{triangular}} Nb wire networks {{with high}} normal-state resistance are fabricated {{by using a}} negative tone hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) resist. Robust magnetoresistance oscillations are observed up to high magnetic fields and maintained at low temperatures, due to the eective reduction of wire dimensions. Well-defined dips appear at integral and rational values (1 / 2, 1 / 3, 1 / 4) of the reduced flux f = Phi/Phi_ 0, {{which is the first}} observation in the <b>triangular</b> <b>wire</b> networks. These results are well consistent with theoretical calculations for the reduced critical temperature as a function of f. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{geometrical}} confinement, atomic position and orientation of Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) on their thermal properties are investigated using the phonon dispersion obtained using a Modified Valence Force Field (MVFF) model. The specific heat (C_v) and the ballistic thermal conductance (κ^bal_l) shows anisotropic variation with changing cross-section {{shape and size}} of the SiNWs. The C_v increases with decreasing cross-section size for all the <b>wires.</b> The <b>triangular</b> <b>wires</b> show the largest C_v due to their highest surface-to-volume ratio. The square wires with [110] orientation show the maximum κ^bal_l since they have the highest number of conducting phonon modes. At the nano-scale a universal scaling law for both C_v and κ^bal_l are obtained with respect to the number of atoms in the unit cell. This scaling is independent of the shape, size and orientation of the SiNWs revealing a direct correlation of the lattice thermal properties to the atomistic properties of the nanowires. Thus, engineering the SiNW cross-section shape, size and orientation open up new ways of tuning the thermal properties at the nanometer regime. Comment: 11 figures, 4 tables, submitted to JA...|$|R

The processing procedures consist of As doping, deposition of silicon nitride layer, electron beam lithography, reactive ion etching, wet oxide and deposition of polysilicon. The resulting Si "twin nano wires': have a small top wire with a dimension of 10 nm and a <b>triangular</b> channel <b>wire</b> with a height of 250 nm.

The toque, {{formed as}} a low cap, has a flattened circular crown of artificial(?) off-white woven straw, which is divided into 4 unequal segments by two bands of crossing yellow velvet ribbon.

50|$|The two-spar wing had a {{straight}} leading edge and constant chord {{out to a}} little over half span, where the trailing edges of the ailerons, hinged at a slight angle to the spar, curved inwards to the wingtips. It was braced from above with pairs of wires from the spars to a central, inverted V-strut pylon and below by wires to the lower nacelle longerons. There were no flaps or air brakes. The central wing rib was continued rearward with the upper member of the open, flat, converging Warren girder fuselage, whose lower member joined the keel of the plywood- and fabric-covered nacelle just aft of the wing trailing edge. This placed the open single cockpit just forward of the wing leading edge. A central keel skid formed the main undercarriage, with assistance from a tail bumper. A narrow-span, <b>triangular</b> tailplane, <b>wire</b> braced above and below, carried longer-span elevators with rounded tips and a cut-out for the deep, rounded rudder hinged to small, triangular fin.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the simulation of an SOI nano-flash memory device. The device {{is composed of}} a <b>triangular</b> quantum <b>wire</b> channel P-MOSFET with a self-aligned nano-floating gate embedded in the gate oxide. The simulation is carried out by combining TSUPREM- 4 [1] and a two-dimensional (2 -D) self-consistent solution of the Poisson and Schrodinger equations. The fabrication process as well as quantum physics are taken into account. Hole distribution in the inversion layer of the triangular channel section. is calculated in terms of wave functions and energy subbands. The threshold voltage shift between the programming and erasing of the device is investigated. In this paper, we show that the channel shape {{plays a crucial role}} in the programming voltage and the threshold voltage shift. Based on the fact that the holes are confined mainly at the top of the triangular channel section, we explain why our triangular channel device can be operated at relatively low programming voltage despite of a thick gate oxide and tunnel oxide. The threshold voltage shift in the triangular channel device is compared with that in a rectangular channel device. The result shows that the triangular channel device exhibits the larger threshold voltage shift...|$|R
