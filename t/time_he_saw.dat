5|$|Altgens {{returned}} to Dealey Plaza {{to photograph the}} assassination site for diagramming purposes, then was sent to Dallas City Hall to retrieve the work of another AP photographer who had pictures of accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald in custody.

5|$|On January 7, 1610, Galileo wrote {{a letter}} {{containing}} the first mention of Jupiter's moons. At the <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> only three of them, and he believed them to be fixed stars near Jupiter. He continued to observe these celestial orbs from January 8 to March 2, 1610. In these observations, he discovered a fourth body, and also observed that the four were not fixed stars, but rather were orbiting Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the Civil War, Gwyn resumed the life he had left behind in 1861. He returned home to his wife Margaret and daughters Elizabeth and Matilda, now five years older than the last <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them. He applied for his military pension on October 6, 1866. Though Gwyn served in positions with a difficulty as high as major general, because he was only brevet, the payment he received would be reduced to the level of his highest non-brevet rank; which would be colonel, the position he effectively gave up on October 14, 1864.|$|E
60|$|He {{read the}} letter carefully, not once, but several <b>times.</b> <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> how Martin and Toglet had failed twice {{in their efforts to}} take Ralph from his path forever.|$|R
5000|$|Goldberg was {{interested}} in politics from a young age. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> the bodies of both Lord Mayors of Cork Tomás Mac Curtain and Terence MacSwiney lying in state, which {{had a profound effect}} on him, as did the four <b>times</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Michael Collins speak.|$|R
60|$|At each {{of these}} three <b>times,</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> with horror that, in spite of the vast {{intellectual}} distance between them, and their being unlike each other in all physical respects, the expression on the boy's face was the expression on his own.|$|R
5|$|A week-long {{visit to}} White House Farm had been {{arranged}} for the August at the Bambers' request; the plan was that the boys would visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with their father. Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant {{to stay at the}} farm. They disliked that June made them pray, and in the car on the way asked their father to speak to her about it. In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and was worried about being forced to eat meat. When their father dropped them off at the house on 4 August, it was the last <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them. The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the casket with her ashes was placed in their coffin.|$|E

25|$|The {{expedition}} {{ended in}} October 1898 and Rivers returned to England.” In 1900, Rivers joined Myers and Wilkin in Egypt to run {{tests on the}} colour vision of the Egyptians; {{this was the last}} <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Wilkin, who died of dysentery in May 1901, aged 24.|$|E
50|$|In Setúbal, Jorginho's {{first year}} was short of impressive, scoring two goals in 32 games. In the 2002-03 campaign, while <b>he</b> netted ten <b>times,</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Vitória {{sink to the}} second division, but helped it return to the top flight in the {{immediate}} year with a career-best 17 goals.|$|R

60|$|For {{the first}} <b>time,</b> when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> her {{standing}} up, and realized how frail a creature she really was, {{a wave of}} pity swept away his own predominant sense of self-interest.|$|R
25|$|Meyer Schapiro {{is one of}} the best-remembered Marxist {{art historians}} of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about {{numerous}} time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, at which <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> evidence of capitalism emerging and feudalism declining.|$|E
25|$|When Morgan {{took the}} {{professorship}} in experimental zoology, he became increasingly {{focused on the}} mechanisms of heredity and evolution. He had published Evolution and Adaptation (1903); like many biologists at the <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> evidence for biological evolution (as in the common descent of similar species) but rejected Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection acting on small, constantly produced variations.|$|E
25|$|Ron Lieberman {{returned}} to the couple's apartment after midnight that night and noticed Philip was not there. He believed she had stayed out late or all night, {{as she had been}} doing, and resolved to remind her the next <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> her to call him under those circumstances. He went to bed as he had to get up early the next morning for work.|$|E

5000|$|Steenstra {{was used}} almost entirely {{as a starter}} in his pre-major league pro career. In fact, he {{was used as a}} {{reliever}} only four <b>times.</b> <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> quite a bit of success in the minors, with a string of three very successful seasons between 1992 and [...] In 1992, with the Geneva Cubs and Peoria Chiefs, he went a combined 9-3 with a 1.89 earned run average.

25|$|As {{a member}} of the royal family, he began {{performing}} engagements at an early age. At the age of sixteen, he walked behind the coffin of his uncle, George VI, at his state funeral in 1952, which also was the first <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> his uncle, the former Edward VIII, who left the country after having abdicated when the young prince was just twelve months old. In 1953, he attended the coronation of his cousin, Elizabeth II, paying homage at her throne after her coronation (following the Dukes of Edinburgh and Gloucester).|$|E
25|$|In 1939 Robert Menzies became Prime Minister for {{the first}} <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> Casey as a rival, and moved him to the lesser {{portfolio}} of Supply and Development. In 1940 Casey resigned from parliament when Menzies appointed him as the first Australian Ambassador to the United States. This was a vital posting in wartime, but it also served to remove Casey from domestic politics. Casey was in Washington, D.C. when the US entered the war, and {{played an important role}} in establishing the alliance between the US and Australia. In this effort he engaged the services of public relations counselor Earl Newsom.|$|E

Meanwhile, Emma is determined to stop Hook and everyone follows her and tell the others to split up. Regina and Robin then run into Zelena, who vows to get custody of her daughter, only to be confronted {{by a group of}} Dark Ones who then place a mark on Emma's family and friends in a similar fashion. Gold explains to Emma that it is the Mark of Charon, who navigates the ferry to the Underworld. The Dark Ones plan to sacrifice the souls of the marked living, who will replace them in Hell. Then, the 21 resurrected Dark Ones march through Storybrooke, led by Nimue, to prepare for their final battle.|$|E
60|$|The Big House, {{with all}} its worthy marvels and bizarre novelties, competed with the figure of Paula Forrest in filling the content of his imagination. Once again, and yet again, many <b>times,</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the slender fingers of Dar Hyal weaving {{argument}} in the air, the black whiskers of Aaron Hancock enunciating Bergsonian dogmas, the frayed coat-cuffs of Terrence McFane articulating thanks to God for the two- legged work-beasties that enabled him to loaf at Dick Forrest's board and under Dick Forrest's madroño trees.|$|R

25|$|Vijaya tied a {{protective}} (paritta) thread on {{the hands of}} all his followers. Later, a Yakkhini (a female Yaksha) appeared before Vijaya's followers in form of a dog. One of the followers thought {{that the presence of}} a dog indicated the existence of a habitation, and went chasing her. After following her for some <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a Yakkhini named Kuveni (or Kuvanna), who was spinning thread. Kuveni tried to devour him, but Vijaya's magical thread protected him. Unable to kill him, Kuveni hurled the follower into a chasm. She did the same thing to all the 700 followers. Meanwhile, Vijaya came to Kuveni's place, looking for his men. Vijaya overpowered her, and forced her to free his men. Kuveni asked Vijaya to spare her life, and in return, swore loyalty to him. She brought, for Vijaya and his followers, food and goods from the ships of the traders whom she had devoured earlier. Vijaya took Kuveni as his consort.|$|E
25|$|During World War II Paavolainen {{served at}} the Information Department of the Headquarters. He was posted after the {{outbreak}} of the Winter War to Mikkeli in eastern Finland, as adjutant to an infantry general and visited Vienola in 1944. His childhood home with its famous palm tree room was destroyed. It was the last <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> his place of birth. Paavolainen's critical World War II diary Synkkä yksinpuhelu, published in 1946, was attacked domestically because of its opposition and surmounted opinions of the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, and Paavolainen's suggested anticipation of the defeat in the early war years. While Paavolainen was during 1940-1941 enthusiastic about an expected German victory and had contacts to the Nazi-inspired Suomen Kansallissosialistinen Työjärjestö (SKT, 'National Socialist Worker's Organization of Finland), he soon started to have reservations about Finland's alliance with Germany as the tide of the war turned against them. After Synkkä yksinpuhelu received major criticism in Finland, Paavolainen effectively ended his career as a publishing writer.|$|E
500|$|The Welsh {{politician}} and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited {{the church in}} 1850. He said that St Nidan's, which he described as [...] "now abandoned and in great measure ruinated", was [...] "a larger and better structure {{than most of the}} Anglesey churches." [...] At the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it, the walls were still largely in place but the only roofed section was the western end; he commented that most of the church was [...] "open to the skies." ...|$|E
5000|$|... • When guest hosts appeared, Vizard's {{voice would}} {{announce}} {{that they would}} be 'playing the role of Mister Steven Vizard', reinforcing a concept that he had mentioned at the <b>time,</b> that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> his on-screen persona as a character.|$|R

60|$|The half-offended idiotic {{expression}} of the man's face was intensely ludicrous, but Paul {{could not see the}} ludicrous at that <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> only <b>saw</b> his usually sedate, manly, generous friend reduced to a state of imbecility.|$|R
500|$|David Bowie, who befriended Lennon in {{the mid-1970s}} (Lennon co-wrote and {{performed}} on Bowie's US #1 hit [...] "Fame" [...] in 1975), performed a tribute to Lennon in the final show of his Serious Moonlight Tour at the Hong Kong Coliseum, on 8 December 1983—the third anniversary of Lennon's death.

500|$|The song's {{narrative}} is in first person, and depicts Swift apologizing {{to a young}} man whose heart she broke.

50|$|Purdon married, {{stayed in}} Chester-le-Street {{after the war}} and worked in the pits digging coal in three foot seams with water up to his knees at <b>times.</b> <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> and shared the {{hardship}} of the miners; many of his songs reflect the sense of community that an embattled people develop. But it was not all doom and gloom. While The Easington Explosion laments the deaths of eighty one miners in one accident, Hally's Piebald Galloway laments the loss of the Lumley pit banner, eaten by a Galloway pony; ponies were used to haul coal carts underground.|$|R
