40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel deep {{coherence}} model (DCM) using a {{convolutional neural network}} architecture to capture the <b>text</b> <b>coherence.</b> The <b>text</b> <b>coherence</b> problem is investigated with a new perspective of learning sentence distributional representation and <b>text</b> <b>coherence</b> modeling simultaneously. In particular, the model captures the interactions between sentences by computing the similarities of their distributional representations. Further, it can be easily trained in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed model is evaluated on a standard Sentence Ordering task. The experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and promise in coherence assessment showing a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art by a wide margin.

40|$|A <b>text’s</b> <b>coherence</b> clearly {{depends upon}} the way ideas are related within that text, {{both in terms of}} their logical relations, as well as the {{cohesive}} devices that show, or create, the links between ideas, across paragraphs and sentences. Thus, it would appear that part of the ability of a competent reader is to recognize the appropriate order of ideas in text, to identify cohesion and <b>coherence</b> in <b>text</b> in order to relate the ideas to each other, and to understand authorial intention with respect to the sequence of ideas. It follows from this that a potentially useful test method that might tap such abilities is to require candidates to inspect text in which the elements are out of order, and to reconstruct the original order. This, it might be supposed, would require candidates to detect the relationship among ideas, to identify cohesive devices and their interrelationships. Such test methods are, indeed, increasingly common in so-called reading tests. However, we know of no reports of research into, or even descriptions of the use of, this promising task type. In this article we report on potential problems in scoring responses to sequencing tests, the development of a computer program to overcome these difficulties, and an exploration of the value of various scoring procedures...|$|R

40|$|Coherence {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} qualities that give a text (semantic) unity and functional purpose. As an essential condition for well-formed and meaningful <b>texts</b> <b>coherence</b> {{has been the focus of}} linguistic studies since the sixties of the last century. It was initially defined as a grammatical property, then as a semantic phenomenon at the level of relations between single words or whole clauses, as a pragmatic notion (coherence between speech acts) and as a cognitive process or construct guided by the linguistic input and inferred from non-linguistic factors. In the modern text linguistics the term ‘text’ refers to a multimodal unity of diverse semiotic codes (language, visual image, music, sound). In recent years a great number of works have appeared dealing with the ways that the elements of visual mode constitute the text-meaning. Still, there has been hardly any work on the nature of the semantic relationships across and between various modes and their medialities. In this paper the author reviews on the one hand previous studies on textuality and text-coherence (starting from the grammatical approach) and discusses aspects in which the coherence can be analyzed as a multidimensional phenomenon, on the other hand tries to point out some new aspects of coherence which occur with the ‘text’ notion in the multimodal linguistics...|$|R

40|$|The present article {{reports on}} a study {{investigating}} the interaction of a reading comprehension test with gender in a formal testing context {{and the performance of}} males and females on reading test items with regard to demands on strategy use. Participants were 187 (59 =female and 128 =male) international students ranging from 17 to 20 years of age studying English at the intermediate level, at The School of Foreign Languages in North Cyprus. Three reading comprehension passages with 25 questions were given to the participants as the final exam of the course. Two of the texts according to Bügel and Buunk’s (1996) classification had male topics and one had a neutral topic. The questions on these passages tapped different information and each question required the students to interact with the reading passages in a different way. The questions given to students were classified into 6 categories: identifying main idea, reading for specific information, guessing meaning from context, identifying referential information, matching titles with paragraph, and <b>text</b> <b>coherence.</b> The findings of the study suggest that males and females perform differently on different items. Females scored higher on identifying main idea, guessing meaning from context, and <b>text</b> <b>coherence</b> questions. Conversely, males outperformed females in reading for specific information, identifying referential information, and matching titles with paragraph. However, gender affected item performance in only two cases: guessing meaning from context, and <b>text</b> <b>coherence</b> in favor of the females. Nonetheless, the overall performance of males and females on the reading test was not significantly different which implies that text topic did not influence male and female performance on the reading comprehension test.

30|$|The present {{research}} chooses {{the perspective of}} coherence from a systemic functional linguistic view as the entry point to compare a source Chinese text and its two English translations, so as to illuminate {{the differences in the}} realization of coherence in both the Chinese source text and the English target <b>texts</b> and how <b>coherence</b> is kept and achieved in translation. It is necessary to examine the feasibility of systemic functional linguistics applied in analysing the realization of coherence in both Chinese and English. One benefit of systemic functional linguistics is that it can provide an overall view of different languages, and can describe both Chinese and English texts from a multi-dimensional view. The description can therefore set the two language texts in the same framework, which provides a basis for a comparative study. To compare the ways that the source and target <b>texts</b> realize <b>coherence,</b> the study will elaborate how the two English target texts handle the transference of coherence and how they are different from the Chinese source text and from each other based on the different properties of systemic functional linguistics.|$|R

40|$|AbstractRather {{than being}} a random {{sequence}} of unrelated sentences and clauses, a text must have solid sense relations between its units to be logically and semantically consistent for the reader-hearer. This logical and semantic consistency relating to the construction and configuration of sense in a <b>text</b> is called <b>coherence</b> by <b>text</b> linguists. <b>Coherence</b> is vital for a complete meaning and understanding of a text. As a cohesive device, reference, especially anaphoric reference, has been examined in many studies in recent years. This study aims to investigate anaphoric expressions by Turkish speakers of French in their spontaneous speech. 29 undergraduate students (23 females and 6 males) with 22 - 25 age range studying at a French language department in Turkey as well as five native speakers of French (three females and two males) with 35 - 55 age range participated in the study.

Expert raters scored the essays for overall quality and <b>text</b> <b>coherence.</b> In terms of overall essay quality, increasing text content (i. e., elaboration) and improving cohesion both led to significant gains in expert judgments of writing quality, and {{a combination of both}} elaboration and improved cohesion led to increased scores over increased cohesion alone. Judgments of <b>text</b> <b>coherence</b> were increased by improved cohesion (but not elaboration); and a combination of both elaboration and improved cohesion led to higher human ratings of coherence in comparison to the original and elaborated versions.

40|$|Previous work by Lin et al.

In this paper, we study the impact of deep discourse structures for the task of co-herence evaluation, using two approaches: (1) We compare a model with features derived from discourse relations in the style of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988), which annotate the full hierarchical discourse structure, against our re-implementation of Lin et al. ’s model; (2) We compare a model encoded using only shallow RST-style discourse relations, against the one encoded using the complete set of RST-style discourse relations. With an evaluation on two tasks, we show that deep discourse structures are truly useful for better dif-ferentiation of <b>text</b> <b>coherence,</b> and in general, RST-style encoding is more powerful than PDTB-style encoding in these settings. ...|$|E

Following the procedure, six revisers who have enough experience in either teaching Japanese or scoring Japanese essays revised 120 Japanese essays written by Japanese native speakers. Comparing the original and revised texts, we found some specific manual revisions frequently occurred between the original and revised texts, e. g. ‘thesis ’ statements were frequently placed {{at the beginning of}} a text.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{favourable}} judgements by some of his contemporaries, and in {{spite of the}} fact that a number of his poems figure in anthologies of French poetry, La Bo'tie's 'Vers fran'ois' of 1571 / 72 and the twenty-nine sonnets published by Montaigne in Book I of the 'Essais' (1580) have not been well received by critics over the years. Even Montaigne was ambivalent about the Vers fran'ois and voiced the opinion that the poems were not sufficiently polished or refined. This article reassesses the poetic value of the 'Vers fran'ois' by undertaking a detailed textual analysis of the dispositio and elocutio of a number of the sonnets and arguing for a more nuanced appreciation of his verse. In an opening general comment, it is suggested that part of the criticism levelled at La Bo'tie's verse is based on a misunderstanding of the disposition of his sonnets, the structural cohesion of which depends not on the more usual stylistic interplay between two quatrains and two tercets, but on the predominant patterning of two quatrains (ABBA ABBA) followed by a distich (CC) and a final quatrain (DEED). A detailed study of two sonnets (nos. 3 & 15) follows in which the structural and closural features (lexical, phonic and syntactical repetitions and parallelisms etc) are seen to give the <b>texts</b> <b>coherence</b> and allusivity. Finally La Bo'tie's sonnet 15 is compared with a sonnet (one of six) which Jean-Antoine de Ba'f rewrote for his 'Diverses Amours' of 1572, and the chapter asserts that the dispositio and elocutio of La Bo'tie's original sonnets are superior to Ba'f's six rewritings...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a written}} assignment in which {{art and design}} {{students were asked to}} research and supply an image as a visual conclusion to a short essay. The essay had to be written in a very strict and unyielding format; it had to argue one of two viewpoints on offer prompted by an image which was already supplied and which introduced the task. Thus the essay was in a sequence of supplied introductory image, text to be written, concluding image to be found. The concluding image had to match the shape and size of the introductory image. It also had to match its colour, content and compositional register. Given the discipline of the students, many were surprisingly unsuccessful {{in this part of the}} task, and simply used images which matched the literal content of the introductory image and their essays. Even this literal matching was at times inaccurate and insensitive. The successful attempts used the text – whose shortness meant that essay conventions were severely strained – as an eristic bridge between the two images. This meant that the successful essays exploited the rhetorical potential of format and tenets of iconology, Gombrich’s ‘invisible world of ideas’. In successful essays, the concluding image also acted as a check on the short <b>text’s</b> <b>coherence,</b> because the importance of its content over exhibitionist techniques was always emphasized yet its shortness often made such techniques essential. This gave some essays an exquisite poise as readings oscillated between the three elements and meanings stayed nimble.
