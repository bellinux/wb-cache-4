40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} produce AZ 91 and AZ 31 {{magnesium}} alloy billets semisolid continuous casting by using an inclined cooling plate was carried out. The molten magnesium alloy in an electric furnace was flowed on the inclined cooling plate and then poured in a tundish. The slurry prepared using this process was solidified by drawing a dummy bar from a water-cooled copper mold, consequently producing a billet. As a result, we could produce the magnesium alloy billets by semisolid continuous casting. Magnesium alloy billets with refined and globular primary α crystals were successfully and continuously cast by optimizing the solidification conditions. In this case, the grain size of AZ 91 billets was about 55 μm and that of AZ 31 billets was 50 μm. The AZ 91 billets produced by semisolid continuous casting were employed in <b>thixocasting</b> experiments.

Measurement of microstructural parameters such as Al-alpha particle size, shape factor, contiguity and entrapped liquid showed a relative equivalency among the various conditioning techniques.

40|$|High {{pressure}} die casting is widely used {{for the possibility of}} obtaining net-shape components of complex geometry and thin wall thickness at high production rates. Unfortunately, conventional die casting has a major limitation that is the presence of defects, which prevents its use on a larger scale. Semi-solid metalworking is a complex process to obtain high integrity die casting components. During semi-solid process a partially liquid–partially solid metal mixture is injected into the die cavity. Castings produced using semi-solid process with hypo-eutectic Al-Si alloys have little or no defects with higher mechanical properties. The non-dendritic microstructure is constituted of solid phase globules, surrounded by an Al-Si eutectic matrix. This paper describes the influence of temperature and time on the obtaining of such globular microstructure during partial remelting and isothermal holding of an A 356 <b>thixocasting</b> alloy.

40|$|Abstract. The {{spheroidal}} grains in billets {{used for}} semi-solid casting are generally manufactured by electromagnetic stirring (EMS) during the casting process. This method however, is not economically applicable for small quantities of the thixo billets. Swirled Enthalpy Equilibration Device (SEED) {{has been developed}} as a rheocasting process, and the SEED process is of interest for developing new thixo alloys, {{as well as for}} optimizing the <b>thixocasting</b> processes for high quality components.

The experimental results show that for as-cast billets made from SEED process, a well-developed spheroidal grain structure is distributed throughout the cross-section of the billet, while for as-cast EMS billets, the grain structure is inhomogeneous, i. e., a dendritic structure was present adjacent to the surface of the billet, while a uniform, spheroidal structure was present at the centre.

40|$|The use of {{recycled}} machining chips instead of aluminium powder to produce foamable precursor material {{leads to a}} significant decrease of the material and manufacturing costs. For the processing of aluminium cutting chips the <b>thixocasting</b> technique is appropriate because this technique offers the possibility to directly use chip-slugs briquetted analogueously to the normal procedure for chip recycling. The strong shearing of chip-material and the high temperatures during the <b>thixocasting</b> process lead to precursor components with a homogenous structure. For the present investigation the alloy AlMg 4. 5 Mn 0. 7 was selected because large quantities of chips from this alloy are available resulting from e. g. sawing processes. The challenge was to improve the known unfavourable foaming characteristics of this alloy {{by the addition of}} small quantities of stabilizing particles, elements and their combinations. For the investigations the following additives were used: CaO, TiB 2, Si 3 N 4, Al 2 O 3; Sn, Sb, as well as the combinations of CaO with Al 2 O 3 and CaO with Sn. The foaming agent quantity was l wt. % TiH 2 for all variants. The briquettes were heated in a conventional air-circulation furnace into the semi-solid state. After heating the slugs were transferred to the <b>thixocasting</b> machine and pressed into a plate cavity. For the qualitative evaluation of the foaming behaviour and the pore structure specimens of each mixture were foamed without and also within a foaming mould. The quantitative expansion and collapse behaviour of the samples were characterized with a mechanical expandometer. The different test methods showed the best foam stabilization characteristics for CaO, Si 3 N 4 and Al 2 O 3. Furthermore, it is interesting that the individual addition of CaO or Sn showed positive effects on the expansion, foam structure and the drainage.

Especially for In and for 3 micrometer-Al 2 O 3 -particles, significant improvements of the foaming behaviour as expressed by the maximum expansion levels obtainable could be observed. In contrast, no major variation of compression strength was substantiated by the experimental data, {{the exception to the}} rule being Sn additions, which led to a deterioration of strength as consequence of unfavourable microstructural characteristics. Pore sizes, however, have invariably been found to decrease irrespective of nature and concentration of additions. Thus the study suggests that the use of additives of the kind evaluated here should be motivated by requirements regarding expansion performance rather than maximum strength. However, given the limited number of samples available, the influence of the observed structural changes on the scatter of mechanical properties could not be judged. Therefore, a continuation of the present study to verify the influence of mesostructural features on property variation at given densities may be considered worthwhile...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} an {{experimental}} and numerical study of globularization during reheating of <b>thixocast</b> billet having non-dendritic microstructure. The process of reheating {{is an important}} step in the semisolid processing and is essential to control its microstructure and hence its mechanical properties. Material chosen for this study is Aluminum alloy, A 356. The primary focus of this study is the heat treatment below eutectic temperature i. e. transformation in solid phase. It is found that during short duration heat treatment, globularization of primary α grains and spheroidization of eutectic Si flakes take place which improves the mechanical properties of semisolid cast products significantly. A prolonged heat treatment is found to degrade the properties of castings since it enhances the porosity and coarsening of Si. The study suggests that a precise heat treatment practice can be designed to improve the semisolid microstructure. A computational model based on Phase field approach has been proposed to study this phenomena. Predictions based on this model are qualitatively compared with corresponding experimental observations. Since eutectics form an important step in multiphase solidification, an attempt has been made to develop an enthalpy based explicit micro-scale model for eutectic solidification. In this preliminary study, growth of adjacent α and β phases in a two dimensional Eulerian framework has been simulated. The model is qualitatively validated with Jackson Hunt theory. Results show expected eutectic growth. This methodology promises significant saving in computational time compared to existing numerical models...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{the work}} {{analyses}} the thixoability of SAE 1070, SAE 1548 and SAE 4340 steels; {{the possibility of}} producing thixotropic semi-solid by partial melting of these alloys and the phase transformations taking place during the process. Design/methodology/approach: thixoability was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine transformation temperatures involving liquid formation and dfl/dT within the solidification range. Thixotropic slurries were produced by heat treatments at different temperatures above Ts, and distinct holding times. Microstructures were analysed by RX diffractometry, optical and electronic microscopy and EDS microanalysis. Findings: {{results show that the}} three alloys investigated present high thixoability, given by wide solidification ranges associated with affordable sensitivity of liquid fraction with temperature within these ranges. Higher thixoability is presented by SAE 1070, followed by SAE 1548 and SAE 4340. Results show also that is perfectly feasible the production of thixotropic slurries of all investigated alloys, by simply heating to temperatures where a liquid phase can be present. Spheroidisation of solid primary phase is fast and increasing holding time at the semi-solid temperature leads to excessive growth of the globules in the <b>thixocast</b> material. Research limitations/implications: thixoability prediction models rely on sensitive experiments as thermoanalysis, with results strongly dependent on experimental conditions; and on thermodynamic data, sometimes not available or reliable for a specific alloy composition. Practical implications: the prediction of the thixoability of a certain alloy can make it more effective its thixoprocessing, allows better control of processing parameters and of the quality of final product. The viability of producing thixotropic semi-solid of ferrous alloys by simple partial melting can definitively insert these families of metallic alloys in the semi-solid processing field. Originality/value: ferrous alloys have become part of the thixoforming scenario more recently, when compared to aluminium and magnesium alloys. Therefore, the study of the thixoability of three commercial steels can bring important information as far as their utilization in thixoforming processing is concerned...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} high {{performance}} cast aluminum alloy components is often disturbed by increasing impurity elements, such as iron accumulated from recycled scraps. It is strongly required that coarse plate-like iron compound of モ-Al 5 FeSi turns into harmless form {{without the need}} for applying refining additives or expensive virgin ingots. The microstructural modification of Al- 7 mass%Si alloy billets with different iron contents was examined by applying ultrasonic vibration during the solidification. Ultrasonically melt-treated billets were thixocast right after induction heating up to the semisolid temperature of 583 ìC, the microstructure and tensile properties were evaluated in the thixocast components. Globular primary メ-Al is required to fill up a thin cavity in <b>thixocasting,</b> so that the microstructural modification by ultrasonic melt-treatment was firstly confirmed in the billets. With ultrasonic melt-treatment in the temperature range of 630 ìC to 605 ìC, the primary メ-Al transforms itself from dendrite into fine globular in morphology. The coarse plate-like モ-Al 5 FeSi compound becomes markedly finer compared with those in non-treated billets. Semisolid soaking up to 583 ìC, does not appreciably affect the size of モ-Al 5 FeSi compounds; however, it affects the solid primary メ-Al morphology to be more globular, which is convenient for <b>thixocasting.</b> After <b>thixocasting</b> with preheated billets, eutectic silicon plates are extremely refined due to the rapid solidification arising from low casting temperature. The tensile strength of thixocast samples with different iron contents does not change much even at 2 mass% of iron, when thixocast with ultrasonically melt-treated billets. However, thixocast Al- 7 mass%Si- 2 mass%Fe alloy with non-treated billets exhibits an inferior strength of 80 MPa, compared with 180 MPa with ultrasonically melt-treated billets. The elongation is also improved by about a factor of two in thixocastings with ultrasonically melt-treated billets for all iron contents of Al- 7 mass%Si alloys, for example, the elongation of 11 % in thixocast of Al- 7 mass%Si- 0. 5 mass%Fe alloy with ultrasonically melt-treated billets, 5 % in that with non-treated billets...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{relation}} between structure evolution, mechanical properties, and stability was investigated for Al 2 O 3 thin films. The existence of different polymorphs of this material offers a range of properties for applications, but also meets the process control challenges when the formation of phase pure material is desired. The aim of this work is to affect the phase structure evolution and the stability of vapor deposited alumina thin films, especially for the case of PECVD. This goal is achieved by experimental investigations of the PECVD process which show that the alpha-Al 2 O 3 phase is obtained only at conditions with a low precursor ratio, a long pulse length and a high power density. These allow for more efficient precursor dissociation as suggested from plasma OES data as well as larger ion bombardment. When these conditions are not fulfilled, only gamma-Al 2 O 3 or alpha-gamma-mixture is formed. Due {{to the use of}} chloridic precursor, it is found that less Cl content is incorporated in alpha-Al 2 O 3 films with < 1. 0 at. % than in gamma-Al 2 O 3 films (~ 2. 0 at. %). This observation is consistent with a high precursor dissociation and significant surface bombardment for the alpha-phase. Smooth and dense alpha-Al 2 O 3 films with negligible Cl incorporation and elastic properties {{similar to those of the}} bulk alpha-Al 2 O 3 are deposited at a growth temperature of 560 ± 10 °C, applying a novel generator that allows for the operation of a PECVD discharge at approx. 4 times larger power density than those utilized conventionally. Up-scaling of a lab-scale PECVD process to an industrial reactor has been successfully conducted allowing the growth of crystalline alumina on large <b>thixocasting</b> tools at substrate temperatures of 590 °C. Steel <b>thixocasting</b> operations on the coated moulds indicate that coatings are intact after <b>thixocasting.</b> No evidence for adhesive or cohesive failure of the coatings was obtained, indicating efficient protecting of the tools during <b>thixocasting.</b> Investigation of thermal stabilities of gamma-Al 2 O 3 films suggest that the gamma-Al 2 O 3 to alpha-Al 2 O 3 transformation in the PECVD films is faster and occurs at lower temperatures in comparison to the FCA films. This could be due to the porous structure of the PECVD grown films which enhance diffusion processes during the phase transformation. The porous structure of PECVD films further enables the oxidation of a TiAlN interlayer and the extrusion of TiO 2 towards the film surface due to large volume expansion from TiO 2, leading to a complete failure of the coating system. The relative stability of gamma-Al 2 O 3 with respect to alpha-Al 2 O 3 with 2. 5 at% of Si, Cr, Ti, Sc, and Y additives is also explored using ab initio calculations, indicating that Si stabilizes gamma-Al 2 O 3, while Cr stabilizes alpha-Al 2 O 3. This is explained by electronic structure changes induced by the alloying element. As Si is added, a bond length increase in alpha-Al 2 O 3 is observed, while strong and short Si-O bonds are formed in gamma-Al 2 O 3, consequently stabilizing this phase. On the other hand, Cr additions induce a smaller bond length increase in alpha-Al 2 O 3 than in gamma-Al 2 O 3, therefore stabilizing the alpha-Al 2 O 3...|$|E

40|$|Semi-solid metal (SSM) {{processing}} {{has emerged}} as an attractive method for near-net-shape manufacturing due to the distinct advantages it holds over conventional near-net-shape forming technologies. These advantages include lower cycle time, increased die life, reduced porosity, reduced solidification shrinkage, improved mechanical properties, etc. SSM processing techniques can not only produce the complex dimensional details (e. g. thin-walled sections) associated with conventional high-pressure die castings, but also can produce high integrity castings currently attainable only with squeeze and low-pressure permanent mold casting processes. There are two primary semi-solid processing routes, (a) <b>thixocasting</b> and (b) rheocasting. In the <b>thixocasting</b> route, one starts from a non-dendritic solid precursor material that is specially prepared by a primary aluminum manufacturer, using continuous casting methods. Upon reheating this material into the mushy (a. k. a. "two-phase") zone, a thixotropic slurry is formed, which becomes the feed for the casting operation. In the rheocasting route (a. k. a. "slurry-on-demand" or "SoD"), one starts from the liquid state, and the thixotropic slurry is formed directly from the melt via careful thermal management of the system; the slurry is subsequently fed into the die cavity. Of these two routes, rheocasting is favored in {{that there is no}} premium added to the billet cost, and the scrap recycling issues are alleviated. The CRP (Trade Marked) is a process where the molten metal flows through a reactor prior to casting. The role of the reactor is to ensure that copious nucleation takes place and that the nuclei are well distributed throughout the system prior to entering the casting cavity. The CRP (Trade Marked) has been successfully applied in hyper-eutectic Al-Si alloys (i. e., 390 alloy) where two liquids of equal or different compositions and temperatures are mixed in the reactor and creating a SSM slurry. The process has been mostly used for hypo-eutectic Al-Si alloys (i. e., 356, 357, etc.) where a single melt passes through the reactor. In addition, the CRP (Trade Marked) was designed to be flexible for <b>thixocasting</b> or rheocasting applications as well as batch or continuous casting. Variable heat extraction rates can be obtained by controlling either the superheat of the melt, the temperature of the channel system, or the temperature of the reactor.

The CNM process does not use the conventional stirring process, instead, it uses solidification conditions to control nucleation, nuclei survival and grain growth, thereby produce fine and globular structures suitable for semisolid forming. No specialised equipment is required. The method can produce both semisolid slurry for rheocasting and semisolid billet for <b>thixocasting.</b> It can be applied {{to a wide range of}} alloys and can easily be incorporated into existing metal forming installation. Semisolid slurries / billets of hypoeutectic and hypereutectic aluminium-silicon casting alloys, aluminium wrought alloys and a magnesium alloys have been successfully produced...|$|E
40|$|Aluminum alloy foams {{were created}} by {{expanding}} foamable precursors containing a gas-releasing blowing agent in a dense metallic matrix. The precursors were prepared in two different ways: either by hot-compaction of powder mixtures or by <b>thixocasting</b> of billets obtained by cold compaction of powder blends. Foam evolution was visualized by means of real-time X-ray radioscopy with image frequencies ranging up to 18 Hz and spatial resolutions down to 10 µm. The difference in pore formation between the two processing routes could be studied. Rupture of cell walls during foam expansion could be visualized, critical rupture thickness measured, and the time-scale of the rupture process estimated. By manufacturing foam precursors in which defects were incorporated deliberately, {{the question of the}} origin of very large pores in solid metal foams could be examined. By forced cooling of liquid metal foams while recording their structure, the importance of solidification-induced changes of foam morphology was illustrated...|$|E
40|$|Since 2003, {{a concerted}} effort between Alcan Inc. (ARDC: Arvida Research and Development Centre) and the Aluminium Technology Centre (ATC) of the National Research Council of Canada is {{underway}} to develop a technology, dubbed SEED (Swirled Enthalpy Equilibration Device), to produce semi-solid aluminium feedstock. This technology, patented by Alcan Inc., is a simple process offering many advantages over <b>thixocasting,</b> especially for reducing the cost of feedstock. The process involves two main steps: 1) heat extraction to achieve a desired liquid/solid mixture, and 2) drainage of an excess liquid to produce a self-supporting semi-solid slug that is cast in a high pressure press. This paper reports that the SEED technology is applicable {{to a number of}} aluminium alloys and can be easily adapted to produce a wide range of slug dimensions. Furthermore, since the heat transfer plays a predominant role during the manufacture of the semi-solid slurry, its analysis is also presented. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|In the {{laboratory}} stage <b>thixocasting</b> of steels {{has shown a}} great potential as a modern method for making thin-walled and complex parts. Surface defects, incomplete form filling and strong inhomogeneous component characteristics were common manufacturing defects for the components manufactured in the semi-solid state. The present work was configured to improve component quality, to test low-carbon steels tested to their suitability for <b>thixocasting</b> and to carry out calculations and attempts to apply the process to a real component made of steel. In addition to the average temperature, the distribution of temperature in the inductively heated bolt material largely determines {{the accuracy of the}} components. A sufficiently homogeneous temperature distribution could be achieved by an cartridge concept in additition to adapted energy-time programs for the inductive heating system. The fire-resistant lining of the cartridge made from vacuum-fiber material is highly insulating and ensures a virtually airtight that effectively suppressed scaling. The data required for the heating programs of induction heating for the steel alloys 100 Cr 6, 42 CrMo 4 and X 46 Cr 13 have been prepared {{solely on the basis of}} thermo-chemical DTA experiments and calculations. Even with steel alloy X 46 Cr 13 the biggest measurable temperature difference between front and interior was always less than 10 Kelvin. The suitability of the steel alloys X 210 CrW 12, 100 Cr 6 and 42 CrMo 4 was tested in terms of <b>thixocasting</b> a thin walled part. These alloys showed a decreasing flow- and mold filling behavior toward low carbon contents with its origin in the different solidification morphology. The results obtained in the meandering part were reduced by half for 42 CrMo 4 compared to X 210 CrW 12. The parts made from steel 42 CrMoV 4 showed a very clear segregation tendency. The microstructure was highly dependent on wall thickness and could not be homogenized by annealing treatments. For thixoforming of steel a number of solid metals, ceramic coatings and massive ceramics are in question as tool material. Temperature measurements of tool inserts made of different materials and coatings were carried out using infrared thermography. A comparison with the results of simulations showed a viable heat transfer coefficient of about 3000 W/(m 2 K 1). Despite very long cycle times only tools made from Si 3 N 4 ceramic and the hardened copper-base alloy CuCo 1 NiBe (2. 1293) convinced. In order to confirm the transferability of the data to the process window and to validate the collected experiences a knife of the German company BÖKER BAUMWERK was redesigned after the <b>thixocasting</b> requirements works. It is a 265 mm long diving knife of 6 mm thickness with an as cast thickness of 0. 8 mm at the blades. Using the simulation software MAGMAsoft® two variants were developed and manufactured for different tool materials. A casting tool from hot-work steel was designed with a bulky ingate section at the handle to reduce premature solidification. The experiments showed, however, that a comparatively high piston speed of more than 0. 5 m/s is necessary for a complete filling of the thin walled knife parts at a liquid phase concentrations of fl= 55 %. The metallographic analysis showed parts of the knife according to a clear enrichment with liquid phase of the outer regions and the blade tip. A reduction of this macroscopic segregation could not be achieved by the choice of process parameters. Preliminary tests with a ceramic tool heated to temperatures of more than 1000 °C had confirmed that the thermal shock to the tools in contact with the semisolid steel is so low that - even with the oxide-ceramic tool material Al 2 O 3 - no failure occurred. The second casting tool for the diving knife was designed as an actively heated oxide ceramic tool. The numerical simulation showed a laminar filling of the mold in 1420 milliseconds because of a very slow piston velocity vp= 0. 05 m/s and because of the low thermal conductivity of the ceramic. Accordingly in the microscopic analysis, the component actually showed only little difference in globulitic structure between the tip and the handle as well as between core and surface, which was also confirmed by EDS line scans. As the only significant structural defect shrinkage porosity was found at the calculated hotspots because of the lack of a dwell pressure phase. The components had virtually no surface flaws and showed in the reproduction of the tools milling structure the ability to generate functional surfaces with typical sizes of the structure of > 30 microns with high accuracy. For production-based processes with short cycle times (< 60 s) and the associated very high temperatures, this tool system is certainly well suited...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Forging is {{state of}} the art for the {{production}} of hand tools in industrial scales. Due to high demands on stiffness and fracture toughness high-strength forged steels are used to provide components with high mechanical load capacity. In spite of all advantages forging is restricted by some means like the freedom of scope. However, because of the extreme thermal load and the hardly avoidable casting defects, hand tools are nowadays not cast. By <b>thixocasting</b> steel technical difficulties can be reduced and new options are provided, which allow manufacturing of components with much higher complexity than forging. During this work ratchets were thixocast successfully using spring steel type 61 SiCr 7. Based on the STC-concept, a new method to prevent the shot sleeve from damage was tested. Dies made of hot forming tool steel X 38 CrMoV 5 were optimized by simulation and coated by plasma chemical deposition of crystalline Al 2 O 3 protective coatings. The cast parts were heat treated successfully to enhance the toughness, which was measured by tensile and Charpy impact tests...|$|E
40|$|<b>Thixocasting</b> {{requires}} manufacturing of billets with non-dendritic microstructure. Aluminum alloy A 356 billets {{were produced}} by rheocasting in a mould placed inside a linear electromagnetic stirrer. Subsequent heat treatment {{was used to}} produce a transition from rosette to globular microstructure. The current and the duration of stirring were explored as control parameters. Simultaneous induction heating of the billet during stirring was quantified using experimentally determined thermal profiles. The effect of processing parameters on the dendrite fragmentation was discussed. Corresponding computational modeling of the process was performed using phase-field modeling of alloy solidification {{in order to gain}} insight into the process of morphological changes of a solid during this process. A non-isothermal alloy solidification model was used for simulations. The morphological evolution under such imposed thermal cycles was simulated and compared with experimentally determined one. Suitable scaling using the thermosolutal diffusion distances was used to overcome computational difficulties in quantitative comparison at system scale. The results were interpreted in the light of existing theories of microstructure refinement and globularisation...|$|E
