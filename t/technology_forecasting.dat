2500|$|The Bass Model or Bass Diffusion Model was {{developed}} by Frank Bass. [...] It consists of a simple differential equation that describes the process of how new products get adopted in a population. The model presents a rationale of how current adopters and potential adopters of a new product interact. The basic premise of the model is that adopters can be classified as innovators or as imitators and the speed and timing of adoption depends on their degree of innovativeness {{and the degree of}} imitation among adopters. The Bass model has been widely used in forecasting, especially new products' sales forecasting and <b>technology</b> <b>forecasting.</b> Mathematically, the basic Bass diffusion is a Riccati equation with constant coefficients.|$|E

40|$|Aircraft {{have become}} more and more {{dependent}} on computers (information processing) for improved performance and safety. It is clear that this activity will grow, since information processing technology has advanced by a factor of 10 every 5 years for the past 35 years {{and will continue to do}} so. Breakthroughs in device technology, from vacuum tubes through transistors to integrated circuits, contribute to this rapid pace. This progress is nearly matched by similar, though not as dramatic, advances in numerical software and algorithms. Progress has not been easy. Many technical and nontechnical challenges were surmounted. The outlook is for continued growth in capability but will require surmounting new challenges. The <b>technology</b> <b>forecast</b> presented in this report has been developed by extrapolating current trends and assessing the possibilities of several high-risk research topics. In the process, critical problem areas that require research and development emphasis have been identified. The outlook assumes a positive perspective; the projected capabilities are possible by the year 2000, and adequate resources will be made available to achieve them. Computer and information <b>technology</b> <b>forecasts</b> and the potential impacts of this technology on aeronautics are identified.
