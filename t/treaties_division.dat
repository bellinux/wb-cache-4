According to the diary of Grand Chamberlain Hisanori Fujita, the Emperor, looking for a decisive battle (tennōzan), replied that it was premature to seek peace [...] "unless we make one more military gain". Also in February, Japan's <b>treaty</b> <b>division</b> wrote about Allied policies towards Japan regarding [...] "unconditional surrender, occupation, disarmament, elimination of militarism, democratic reforms, punishment of war criminals, and the status of the emperor." [...] Allied-imposed disarmament, Allied punishment of Japanese war criminals, and especially occupation and removal of the Emperor, were not acceptable to the Japanese leadership.|$|R

50|$|The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act {{was passed}} shortly after Franklin Roosevelt was elected President {{in order to}} deal with the {{consequences}} of the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. Smoot-Hawley had raised U.S. import tariffs to an average of over 50 percent ad valorem. This sparked retaliatory, prohibitive tariff increases from trading partners that led to a catastrophic collapse of export sales, worsening already-bad economic conditions during the Great Depression. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act empowered the President to reduce import tariffs on products from countries that agreed to do the same for U.S. products. Congress realized that if tariffs could be reduced in return for a quid pro quo from each trading partner, U.S. exports might have a chance of returning to earlier levels. The bill was largely written in the <b>Treaty</b> <b>Division</b> at State Department, and Wheeler contributed to its drafting.|$|R

50|$|Carthage {{concluded}} {{treaties with}} several states, most notably with Rome. Signed in 509 BC, the <b>treaty</b> formalized a <b>division</b> of influence and commercial activities.

Carthage may have signed the treaty with Rome, then an insignificant backwater, because Romans had treaties with the Phocaeans and Cumae, who were aiding the Roman struggle against the Etruscans at that time. Carthage had similar treaties with Etruscan, Punic and Greek cities in Sicily.|$|R
50|$|The first {{mention of}} Henry {{takes place in}} 1310 when he married the several years older Anna, {{daughter}} of Albert I of Habsburg, the ruler of Austria. A year later, {{as a result of}} the pressure of the nobility of both Wrocław and Legnica (tired of the neglected rule of Bolesław III), the Duchy was divided into three parts: Wrocław, Legnica and Brzeg. The poorest and least important was Brzeg. In the <b>treaty</b> of <b>division,</b> it was stipulated that the brother who takes this district would also receive from the other two a payment of 50,000 fines. As the oldest, Bolesław III was able to choose first; with financial problems, he unexpectedly took Brzeg and the monetary compensation. As a result, Henry was allowed to take Wrocław. He had no problems with paying the debt to his older brother (thanks to the help of the rich Wrocław patricians) and kept the district. The youngest brother, Władysław, who received Legnica, wasn't able to pay his part of the debt and for this was expelled from his land by Bolesław III.|$|R

When he became a ruling Duke in Stettin in 1603, he initially kept these possessions, but in 1605, he gave them to his cousin Philip Julius, who he renamed Neuenkamp to Francis Castle, in honor of his father-in-law Duke Francis of Brunswick-Lüneburg. After Philip Julius's death in 1625, Barth Castle served as Wittum for his widow, Agnes of Brandenburg, until she remarried with Francis Charles of Saxe-Lauenburg in 1628.|$|R

5|$|Furthermore, {{executive}} {{power in the}} EU isn't concentrated in a single institution. It becomes clearer under the Lisbon <b>Treaty</b> with the <b>division</b> of the European Council as a distinct institution with a fixed President. This arrangement {{has been compared to}} the dual executive system found in the French republic where there is a President (the Council President) and Prime Minister (the Commission President). However, unlike the French model, the Council President does not hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the other, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence while the Council President may have prestige, it would lack power and while the Commission President would have power, it would lack the prestige of the former.|$|R

As early as 1843 King Frederick William IV of Prussia visited the Kahler Asten. At the time it was planned to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of the Treaty of Verdun by building an observation tower as {{a monument}}. This <b>treaty</b> sealed the <b>division</b> of the Carolingian Empire into three kingdoms: West Francia, East Francia and Lotharingia and was seen as the beginning of the separate development of the French and German nations. During the 1848 year of revolutions the Asten tower was the target of a demonstration for the aims of the March revolution and of German unity.|$|R
