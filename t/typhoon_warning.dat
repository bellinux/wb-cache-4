5|$|The {{origins of}} Dolphin {{were related to}} a strong {{westerly}} wind burst that also {{led to the formation}} of previous Typhoon Noul. Early on May5, the Joint <b>Typhoon</b> <b>Warning</b> Center (JTWC) began monitoring an area of deep convection approximately 300km (185mi) southwest of Pohnpei. It had a poorly-defined circulation and broad rainbands, while low to moderate wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures favored development. The convection quickly became better organized and more concentrated around the broad center, aided by increased outflow. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression at 06:00UTC on May6 about 325km (200mi) southwest of Pohnpei. At 21:00UTC that day, the Joint <b>Typhoon</b> <b>Warning</b> Center (JTWC) also began issuing advisories on the system, classifying it as Tropical Depression 07W.|$|E
5|$|The last area {{affected}} by Typhoon Roy was the Philippines, which {{was struck by}} the storm on January 16. Prior to the storm's arrival, <b>typhoon</b> <b>warnings</b> were raised for 29 provinces in the country, including the capital city of Manila. In the Bicol Region, winds likely reached typhoon intensity; however, no known damage took place in the area. Continuing westward, the Roy brought gale-force winds to parts of southern Luzon before moving into the South China Sea. Low-lying areas in the storm's path were flooded by heavy rains and strong winds downed power lines in Sorsogon.|$|R
5|$|<b>Typhoon</b> <b>warnings</b> {{were issued}} for Jeju and the {{southern}} and eastern coasts of South Korea ahead of the storm. Passenger ships normally serving Jeju Island remained in port. In Busan, ports were closed, and in Ulsan, 1,600 ships remained in port. In South Gyeongsang Province, authorities banned departures from the port at Tongyeong, stranding over 16,000 fishing boats. The Korean Coast Guard said that a total of 52,000 ships remained at ports across the nation. Mount Jiri was also closed ahead of the storm's passage through Korea, which was expected to bring up to 100mm (4inches) of rain.|$|R
5|$|When Faye {{struck the}} central {{portion of the}} Philippines, three people were {{initially}} reported as missing. The typhoon brought heavy rainfall to Luzon, resulting in overflowing rivers, which in turn flooded low-lying areas. Numerous roads and bridges were washed out. Coconut trees were uprooted, while sugarcane and rice suffered severe damage. There, damage to crops, school buildings, and fish ponds totaled $1.5million. When the typhoon veered toward the island nation for the second time, school classes were briefly halted and six flights of the Philippine Airlines were called off. <b>Typhoon</b> <b>warnings</b> were posted {{for much of the}} northern portion of the country.|$|R
5|$|Tropical Storms {{that formed}} in the entire west Pacific basin were {{assigned}} a name by the Joint <b>Typhoon</b> <b>Warning</b> Center.

This can often result in the same storm having two names.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Favio {{originated}} from {{a zone of}} disturbed weather that was first classified by the Météo-France office on Réunion (MFR) at 1200 UTC February11, 2007. Twelve hours later, the Joint <b>Typhoon</b> <b>Warning</b> Center (JTWC) issued their first advisory on the system. Midday on February12, MFR upgraded the system into a tropical disturbance and noted that its rating at that time on the Dvorak technique was 2.0.|$|E
5|$|In {{what would}} later become the second of two {{tropical}} cyclones to form within the basin during November 1988, an area of disturbed weather was first noted by the Joint <b>Typhoon</b> <b>Warning</b> Center (JTWC) early on November1. Six hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started following the system. The same day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also started to track the storm and assigned it with the local name Welpring.|$|E

5|$|On August 31, Jimena {{encountered}} strong southerly wind shear, {{causing it}} to quickly weaken back to a tropical storm by September 1. Jimena then turned west-southwest where {{the center of the}} storm passed 105miles (165km) south of Hawaii at 1500 UTC. Jimena continued to weaken as wind shear increased and the storm weakened to a tropical depression on September 3. After weakening back to a depression, Jimena crossed the International Date Line on September 5 at 0600 UTC, where it became the first storm to exist in all three Pacific basins since 1999's Hurricane Dora. However, Jimena was only tracked briefly by the Joint <b>Typhoon</b> <b>Warning</b> Center, since strong wind shear resulted in the low level circulation to be exposed from the center and at 1727 UTC, the low level had nearly dissipated. At 1800 UTC, the Joint <b>Typhoon</b> <b>Warning</b> Center issued their final advisory on Jimena as the storm dissipated 715miles (1151km) southeast of Wake Island.|$|E

5|$|The South-West Indian Ocean basin {{consists}} of {{the portion of the}} Indian Ocean west of 90°E and south of the Equator.

50|$|The Observatorio Meteorológico del Ateneo Municipal de Manila (Manila Observatory) {{was founded}} in 1865 by the Jesuits after an article they {{published}} in the newspaper Diario de Manila, describing typhoon observations made in September 1865, {{attracted the attention of}} many readers who publicly requested for the observations to be continued. The Spanish government made the observatory the official institution for weather forecasting in the Philippines in 1884, and in 1885 it started its time service. Its seismology section was set up in 1887, while astronomical studies began in 1899. The Observatory published typhoon and climatological observations and studies, including the first <b>typhoon</b> <b>warnings,</b> a service that was highly appreciated by the business community, specially those involved in merchant shipping.|$|R
50|$|When Ike {{began to}} turn towards the {{northwest}} on September 3, <b>typhoon</b> <b>warnings</b> were issued for areas between Hong Kong and Beihai. Hundreds of cargo ships left port to escape the typhoon. In Zhanjiang, sandbagging operations took place throughout the day {{in an effort to}} construct a barrier against Ike's storm surge. Hundreds of thousands of residents evacuated from coastal areas. Offshore, four foreign oil companies evacuated workers off of drilling rigs in the South China Sea. Further north, in Hong Kong, a No 1. hurricane signal was issued on September 4 and later that day was upped to a No 3. hurricane signal, but was dropped once the storm dissipated inland.|$|R
