5|$|After the war, Fermi {{served under}} J. Robert Oppenheimer on the General Advisory Committee, which advised the Atomic Energy Commission on nuclear matters and policy. Following the {{detonation}} {{of the first}} Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, he strongly opposed {{the development of a}} hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds.

Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons, and he speculated that cosmic rays arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space. Many awards, concepts, and institutions are named after Fermi, including the Enrico Fermi Award, the Enrico Fermi Institute, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station, and the synthetic element fermium, making him one of 16 scientists who have elements named after them.|$|E
5|$|Human {{rights in}} Madagascar are {{protected}} {{under the constitution}} and the state is a signatory to numerous international agreements including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Torture by security forces is rare and state repression is low relative to other countries with comparably few legal safeguards, although arbitrary arrests and the corruption of military and police officers remain problems.

5|$|In 1963, Rangers {{governor}} William Jennings {{introduced to}} his peers {{the idea of}} expanding the league to the American West Coast by adding two new teams for the 1964–65 season.

In February 1966, the governors met and decided to award franchises to Los Angeles, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Oakland and St. Louis. The league rejected bids from Baltimore, Buffalo and Vancouver. In Canada, there was widespread outrage over <b>the</b> <b>denial</b> of an expansion team to Vancouver in 1967; three years later, the NHL awarded a franchise to Vancouver, which formerly played in the Western Hockey League, for the 1970–71 season, along with the Buffalo Sabres.|$|E

40|$|Denial {{has been}} an {{integral}} part of the psychological and disability literature for more than 100 years. Yet, denial is an elusive concept and has been associated with mixed, indeed conflicting, theoretical perspectives, clinical strategies, and empirical findings. In this two-part article, the author provides an overview of the existing literature on <b>denial</b> that addresses <b>the</b> most prominent and rehabilitation-relevant features of it. Part I provides a generic yet clinically based discussion of denial and focuses on the following: historical perspective of <b>denial,</b> <b>the</b> definitions of <b>denial,</b> <b>the</b> types or forms of denial most often encountered in the literature, the functions served by <b>denial,</b> <b>the</b> indicators or markers most frequently associated with <b>denial,</b> <b>the</b> dynamics and processes inherent in <b>the</b> operation of <b>denial,</b> and <b>the</b> costs and benefits of denial...|$|R
40|$|According to “disjunctivist neo-Mooreanism”—a {{position}} Duncan Pritchard {{develops in}} a recent book—it is possible to know <b>the</b> <b>denials</b> of radical sceptical hypotheses, {{even though it is}} conversationally inappropriate to claim such knowledge. In a recent paper, on the other hand, Pritchard expounds an “überhinge” strategy, according to which one cannot know <b>the</b> <b>denials</b> of sceptical hypotheses, as “hinge propositions” are necessarily groundless. The present article argues that neither strategy is entirely successful. For if a proposition can be known, it can also be claimed to be known. If the latter is not possible, this is not because certain propositions are either “intrinsically” conversationally inappropriate (as Pritchard claims in his book) or else “rationally groundless” (as Pritchard claims in his paper), but rather that we are dealing with something that merely presents us with the appearance of being an epistemic claim...|$|R

Kom and Vijender were the first boxers to get the award which carried prize money of Rs 750,000 and a citation. Both Sushil and Vijender were recommended to the Padma Shri awards committee, by the Indian Sports and Home Ministries; however, they were denied the awards after recommendations were not fruitful by the Padma Awards Committee for 2009 winners. <b>The</b> <b>denial</b> of Padma Shri for them created a furore among masses with allegations of promoting only a few sports.

A three-judge panel of the Circuit Court affirmed {{the decision of the}} District Court, holding that the tribe derived its power from its own retained sovereignty that was separate from the sovereignty of the United States. The Eighth Circuit's panel noted that in the Duro decision, the Supreme Court had observed that Congress could address the jurisdictional system, which Congress did. When Congress amended the ICRA, they were addressing a federal common law issue, not a constitutional issue, and were within their authority to recognize the sovereignty of the tribes. The panel then affirmed the trial court on the Petite claim. Judge Hansen dissented, believing that the tribe drew its authority to try Lara from the federal government.|$|E
