40|$|Mestrado em Radiações Aplicadas às Tecnologias da SaúdeAccuracy is the keyword when {{it comes}} to radiotherapy. More {{advanced}} treatments usually take more time, so immobilization is mandatory. However, immobilization does not resolve the intrafraction motion problem, whether it is caused by natural processes such as breathing and heart beating or patient intentional movement. This question {{led to the development of}} the Calypso® 4 D Localization System. This is a system that monitors internal movement when treating allowing to interrupt and to correct any shift that occurs during treatment (intrafraction motion). That way it is possible to detect when the patient moves and also to account for internal movement. This technology was recently acquired and installed in Champalimaud Clinical Center. Considering that I am a radiation therapist in this center where the purpose is to ensure good quality of administered treatments, I could not do but to direct this work towards the field in which I dwell daily. It is advisable to study the effect of any new equipment in treatment delivery and that gives the opportunity to acquire and to explore local data. In the first part of this work, a review on state-of-the-art literature is provided (previously submitted in December 2013 and accepted in May 2014), as to allow for a fully comprehension of the subject discussed here: how Calypso® system works, its advantages when compared to other monitoring systems available and how it is being used around the world. After knowing how Calypso® works, one question is inevitable. In order to monitor the patient continuously an array is positioned above the patient during the treatment and the treatment planning system does not account for that. How much dose does the array attenuate? The second part of this work assesses this subject. A study was performed by measuring the transmitted radiation of several beams (with beam energy, field size and gantry angle variation) with and without the array in the beam path and the attenuation was calculated and analyzed (previously submitted in May). Finally, the third part of this work studies radiation attenuation in treatment tabletops. It was noted when Calypso® system was being installed that changing the treatment table was part of the installation process. For the system to work properly no electric conductive materials are allowed in the array’s volume detection, as the system functions by electromagnetic detection. Carbon fiber is an electric conductive material so the Varian Exact IGRT tabletop was replaced by a table with the two exchangeable inserts kVueTM Universal <b>Tip</b> <b>Insert</b> (carbon fibre) and kVueTM Calypso ® Varian Insert (kevlar). A study was performed in order to determine if there was any loss in treatment administration quality due to the radiation attenuated in the treatment tabletop. Radiation measurements were performed without tabletop and also with each of the three tabletops (with beam energy, field size and gantry angle variation). Attenuation was calculated for the three tabletops. It was assessed if new tabletops attenuated more or less radiation than the original one, and it was considered if it was adequate not to switch between kVueTM Calypso® Varian and kVueTM Universal Tip tabletops according to the use of calypso system or not, respectively. It is noteworthy that the Master Commission authorized the presentation of this work as three scientific articles written in English, with the purpose of future publication in international, peer-reviewed journals. In order to do so it respects some criteria related to this objective. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Authors: Yuri G. Strukov and Andrew S. Belmont This {{protocol}} {{was adapted from}} “Development of Mammalian Cell Lines with lac Operator-Tagged Chromosomes,” Chapter 25, in[*Live Cell Imaging*]([URL] Goldman and Spector). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2005. ### INTRODUCTION The discovery and use of fluorescent proteins to label chromosomal proteins has yielded basic structural information as well as insights into dynamics that were previously inaccessible. This protocol describes a method for tagging specific chromosome sites using the *lac* operator/repressor system, wherein direct repeats of bacterial operator sequences are coupled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged proteins that recognize these sequences. Direct *lac* operator repeats are generated by directional cloning. Although the use of direct repeats, as opposed to inverted repeats, reduces recombination within the bacterial host at high copy number, even the direct repeats are unstable, requiring the use of special bacterial hosts and low-copy-number plasmids for cloning. The introduction of the *lac* operator repeats into eukaryotic cells uses traditional transformation methods. Techniques for the isolation of stable cell clones with varying transgene copy numbers are described in the protocol, as are several methods for visual screening {{of large numbers of}} stable cell clones to isolate rare clones containing labeled chromosomal regions with desired features. ### RELATED INFORMATION In principle, chromosome tagging can be accomplished through the use of any repetitive sequence to which a specific protein binds. The first application of this approach used the bacterial lac operator and Lac repressor combination. The lac operator/Lac repressor-labeling system has been successfully adapted for tagging chromatin in live bacteria, yeast, and mammalian tissue culture cells (Fig. 1), as well as in multicellular organisms including *Caenorhabditis elegans*, *Drosophila*, and *Arabidopsis*. Subsequent approaches have used tet operator or glucocorticoid receptor element repeats. Recently, the lac operator system has been used in combination with the bacteriophage viral replicase translational operator and several color variants of GFP to label DNA, RNA, and protein in living cells. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1. ** Examples of different stable cell lines with lac operator-tagged chromosome regions visualized by GFP-Lac repressor in vivo expression.

Agarose gel (0. 7 %) - Ampicillin (add at 100 μg/mL to both LB medium and LB agar plates) - Bacteria (e. g., Stbl 2 competent cells; Invitrogen/GIBCO) - CaCl 2 (250 mM) - Cells for transfection: CHO DG 44 - DNA preparation kits (e. g., QIAGEN miniprep and maxiprep kits) - Ethanol (70 %; ice-cold 100 %) - Fetal bovine serum (FBS), defined and dialyzed (HyClone Lab) - Fluorescein-labeled methotrexate (FMTX) (Molecular Probes) - Glycine (100 μM) - Hypoxanthine (30 μM) - LB medium (liquid and agar plates) - Media for cells used for transfection - F- 12 (HAM) medium (Invitrogen/GIBCO) supplemented with 10 % defined FBS: for growth of DG 44 cells - F- 12 medium, lacking thymidine and hypoxanthine, with 10 % dialyzed FBS: for selection and further passaging of stably transfected cells - Phosphate-buffered saline, calcium- and magnesium-free (CMF-PBS) - Restriction enzymes SalI and XhoI - Sodium acetate (3 M, pH 5. 5) - TE buffer (optional; see Step 4. vii) - Thymine (30 μM) - TR buffer - Trypsin - Vector (e. g., psv 2 -DHFR- 8. 32) and appropriate insert (e. g., 256 -copy lac operator repeat) (see Steps 1 and 2) ### Equipment 1. Dry ice - Equipment for agarose gel electrophoresis - Filter paper - Flasks (25 -cm 2 tissue culture; 75 -cm 2) - Fluorescence-activated cell sorter - Forceps (sharp-tipped) - Incubator preset to 30 °C - Inoculation loops - Marker (permanent) - Microcentrifuge - Microcentrifuge tubes (1. 5 mL) - Micropipette tips (sterile 200 -μL) (1 mL) (optional; see Step 8. viii) - Microscope - Petri dishes (150 -mm) - Pipette - Plastic hose (optional; see Step 8. viii) - Plates for growing bacterial cultures - Plates (96 -well) - Shaking platform - Tubes for transfection ### METHOD **Preparing Vector DNA Containing Large Direct Repeats** 1. Clone the lac operator repeat into a vector. - *This protocol is based on preparations from our laboratory using the pSV 2 -DHFR- 8. 32 plasmid containing a 256 -copy lac operator repeat*. - i. Use Stbl 2 competent cells grown at 30 °C to help maintain full-length lac operator repeats. - ii. Clone the lac operator repeats into low-copy-number vectors (e. g., psv 2 -DHFR- 8. 32). - *Having too many copies in a cell increases the possibility of recombination*. - Purify vector DNA as follows: - The purification of vector DNA should take no more than 3 d to complete (4 d if the optional second minipreps are performed in Step 2. viii). Recombination may occur if plates or cultures from Step 1 are allowed to stand at 4 °C; thus it is important to complete this procedure without delay. However, the plasmid DNA, once prepared from the cells, is stable. Because low-copy-number plasmids are used, expect low yields at every purification step. - i. Streak bacteria from a stab culture onto an LB plate containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL). Store the stab culture in the dark at room temperature. - ii. Incubate the inoculated LB plate for 24 h at 30 °C. - *Even after this length of time, the colonies will be small*. - iii. Inoculate at least 10 3 -mL cultures of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) with well-isolated colonies. Incubate the cultures on a shaker overnight at 30 °C. - iv. Prepare DNA using a miniprep procedure (e. g., QIAGEN) from 1. 5 mL of each culture. Store the remainder of each culture at 4 °C. - v. Digest aliquots of the DNA with SalI and XhoI. Separate the DNA fragments on an agarose gel (0. 7 %). - *At this step, it is critical to be very discerning. Any bands present other than those expected could indicate recombination of the plasmid (in the case of the pSV 2 -DHFR- 8. 32 plasmid containing a 256 -copy lac operator repeat, expect 10 -kb and 5 -kb fragments) *. - vi. Prepare and freeze a glycerol stock, or prepare a stab culture of each positive clone (from the stored cultures in Step 2. iv). - vii. Inoculate 500 mL of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) with the remaining culture from one of the positive clones. Incubate the culture overnight at 30 °C with shaking. - *It may be preferable to prepare two 500 -mL cultures, each from a different positive clone, in the event that one clone is lost during large-scale growth*. - viii. (Optional) Before proceeding with the maxiprep DNA isolation, isolate DNA from an aliquot of the 500 -mL culture by repeating Steps 2. iv- 2. v. While preparing the miniprep DNA, centrifuge the 500 -mL culture. Discard the supernatant, and freeze the bacterial pellet until ready to use. Use positive cultures for the following step: - ix. Isolate DNA from the 500 -mL culture using a maxiprep procedure. If using QIAGEN maxipreps with Qiafilters, double the volume of P 1, P 2, and P 3 added to each pellet, and then split the prep into two Qiafilters. This prevents the Qiafilter from clogging. - *The yield of DNA will be low. A good yield is ~ 125 μg of DNA per 500 -mL culture*. - x. Digest aliquots of the DNA with SalI and XhoI to confirm that only DNA fragments of the expected size are present. **Making Stable Cell Lines Containing lac Operator Repeats** 3. Grow cells for transfection for ~ 1 wk. - *CHO DG 44 cells are derivatives of CHO K 1 cells and are doubly deleted for the DHFR locus. The product of the DHFR gene is necessary for intermediary metabolism of thymidylates and purines. An imbalance of nucleotides in cells may be the cause of both insert instability due to gene amplification and an abnormal cell cycle due to interference with replication timing*. 4. Purify plasmid DNA for transfection as follows: - i. Transfer 300 μL of vector DNA solution (~ 100 μg/mL) into a 1. 5 -mL microcentrifuge tube. - ii. Add 33 μL of sodium acetate (3 M, pH 5. 5) to the DNA, and thoroughly mix the solution with a pipette. - iii. Add 660 μL of ice-cold 100 % ethanol to the tube, and mix the contents by inverting the tube several times. Let the tube stand on dry ice for 5 min. - *At this step, white fibers of DNA precipitate should be visible*. - iv. Centrifuge the reaction in a microcentrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. For convenience, label the location of the pellet inside the tube with a permanent marker. - v. Remove the supernatant, and wash the pellet with 1 mL of 70 % ethanol at 4 °C by inverting the tube several times. Centrifuge the tube in a microcentrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. - *Carry out all subsequent steps in a sterile environment*. - vi. Remove the supernatant, and immerse the entire open tube in 70 % ethanol for 10 sec. Remove the supernatant. Air-dry the DNA pellet for 10 - 15 min. - vii. Dissolve the dried DNA in 200 μL of sterile H 2 O or TE buffer. - viii. Aliquot DNA dissolved in H 2 O and freeze at - 20 °C for short-term storage. DNA dissolved in TE buffer is stable for at least several weeks at 4 °C. - ix. Remove an aliquot of the DNA, and estimate the concentration and purity of the DNA. 5. Transform cells using calcium-phosphate-precipitated DNA. *Use only chemical transformation with competent cells, not electroporation, because increased recombination following electroporation has been observed. The efficiency of transfection using calcium-phosphate-precipitated DNA strongly depends on the growth state of recipient cells, concentration of calcium and phosphates, concentration of DNA, pH, temperature, and duration of the precipitation reaction. It is advisable to prepare several buffers with slightly different pH values (see Step 5. iii below) *. - i. Plate CHO DG 44 cells in three 75 -cm 2 flasks the day before transfection. - ii. Replace the medium in the flasks with fresh medium 4 h before transfection. Cells should be 50 %- 80 % confluent and be in the log phase of growth for efficient transfection. - iii. Prepare three reaction tubes. In each one, dilute 7 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA (from Step 4. vii) in 0. 5 mL of CaCl 2 (250 mM), mixed with 0. 5 mL of TR buffer, varying only in its pH value (6. 95, 7. 05, or 7. 10). Incubate the reactions for 30 min at room temperature. - iv. Add each DNA mixture dropwise to a flask of cells (from Step 5. ii). Incubate the flasks for 24 h. - v. Replace the transfection medium with F- 12 (HAM) medium supplemented with 10 % defined FBS, and incubate the cells for an additional 24 h. - vi. Replace the medium with selective medium (F- 12 medium lacking thymidine and hypoxanthine, but containing 10 % dialyzed FBS). Stable transformants are obtained after 2 wk of selection. **Enrichment of Stable Cells with Large-Copy-Number Inserts Using Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting** *This procedure describes the selection of CHO cells expressing high amounts of exogenous DHFR from a pool of stably transformed cells using cell sorting, a strategy to enrich for cells harboring large chromosome insertions of the DHFR-containing transgene. Selection is based on binding a fluorescent cell-permeable DHFR inhibitor to the pool of cellular DHFR. Cells with high fluorescence show a high total expression of DHFR, which correlates roughly with copy number (as well as chromosome position effects) *. 6. Select and sort the cells as follows: - i. Grow cells in 25 -cm 2 tissue culture flasks until they are in log phase. - ii. Replace the growth medium with fresh F- 12 (HAM) medium supplemented with FBS (10 %) and FMTX (20 μM). Add glycine (100 μM), hypoxanthine (30 μM), and thymine (30 μM) to the medium to relieve the toxic effects of FMTX. Incubate the cells for 8 h. - iii. Harvest cells by trypsinization, and keep them in sterile PBS on ice. - *Because FMTX is retained in cells at concentrations high enough to cause damage, cells are viable in PBS on ice only for several hours*. - iv. Sort the cells into flasks or 96 -well plates. - v. Grow enough cells for freezing, and freeze them after screening. 7. Prepare a large number of clones for screening or subcloning as follows: - i. Plate cells produced in Step 6 onto a Petri dish at a low density, ideally, 20 - 100 cells per 150 -mm dish. To minimize cross-contamination among neighboring colonies, make sure that the density of plating is low enough and that the colonies are spread out. Use several Petri dishes, titrating the cell concentration by factors of 2 - 3 between dishes, to ensure optimal cell density. - *The action of the trypsin (Step 6. iii) must have progressed enough to ensure the absence of cell clumping and the predominance of single cells in suspension. This is aided by mechanical agitation or by vigorous pipetting of the culture*. - ii. Return the cells to the incubator, and if possible, avoid moving the dishes (particularly after the first few days) for ~ 10 d to allow good-size colonies to form. - *Movement of the dishes will cause cells to dislodge and form satellite colonies and/or a lawn of dispersed cells, increasing cross-contamination*. - iii. Allow the cells to grow until the colonies are well-defined and visible by eye while avoiding overgrowth to minimize colony cross-contamination. Mark individual isolated colonies {{on the bottom of the}} plate with a permanent marker. View the colonies under low magnification to check for the presence of undesirable smaller colonies growing in the vicinity of any colony of interest. 8. If visual screening of the clones is unnecessary, then pick and harvest a large number of colonies from the 150 -mm-diameter Petri dish (from Step 7), using one of the subcloning methods described below. If live visual screening is desired, refer to the Discussion regarding subcloning stable transformants. **Trypsin Method for Picking Colonies** - i. Cut filter paper into small squares, each with an area of ~ 4 mm 2. Use sharp-tipped forceps to place the squares together in a glass Petri dish. Cover them and sterilize by autoclaving. - ii. Aspirate the medium from the Petri dish containing the marked colonies (from Step 7. iii above). - iii. Wash the cells with sterile calcium- and magnesium-free PBS (CMF-PBS), and remove excess liquid. - iv. Dispense trypsin solution into a small sterile Petri dish. Using the sterile forceps, dip a sterile filter paper (from Step 8. i) in trypsin, blot it to remove excess trypsin, and place it over a colony. - v. Repeat Step 8. iv for each of the colonies. Return the Petri dish containing the cells to the incubator for ~ 5 min. - vi. Transfer each filter paper into a separate well of a 96 -well microtiter plate containing 0. 1 mL of tissue culture medium per well. If visual screening will be performed, use a glass-bottom 96 -well plate. Duplicate plating can be accomplished by dipping the filter paper into one well to dislodge some cells, and then dropping the filter paper into a well of a second 96 -well plate. - *The efficiency of colony duplication by this method is close to 100 %. Do not leave the cells without buffer for more than 15 - 20 min or they will dry out. Also, CMF-PBS may induce rounding of cells and/or detachment after prolonged treatment (see Steps 8. x and 8. xi) *. - vii. Grow the collected cells in the 96 -well plates for 1 - 2 d. - viii. Remove the filter paper pieces from the wells, taking care to avoid cross-contamination. One method for doing this is to attach a plastic hose to a vacuum system with an in-line trap. Insert the larger end of a 1 -mL micropipette tip into the hose. Cut the other end of the tip to accommodate a sterile 200 -μL micropipette tip. Next, insert the 200 -μL tip into the bottom of a well. The vacuum will cause the filter paper to adhere to the tip. Withdraw the tip, and discard both the filter paper and the 200 -μL pipette tip. Finally, repeat with the remaining wells, using a fresh sterile 200 -μL tip each time. - ix. Continue to grow the cells until their numbers are sufficient for screening. Screen the cells from each well, and freeze the positive clones. Examine the positive clones by microscopy for the biological activity of interest. **Micropipette Tip Method for Picking Colonies** *This method works well with more densely packed colonies, and it is faster than the trypsin method (Steps 8. i- 8. ix). A few hundred colonies can be easily transferred within a couple of hours. Once this method is optimized, efficiency is near 100 %, although the number of cells transferred per colony into the well may be somewhat lower*. - x. Mark the colonies that are less likely to be cross-contaminated with cells from other colonies. Rinse the cells twice with CMF-PBS (10 mL per 150 -mm dish). Add a small amount of CMF-PBS (~ 4 - 6 mL), just sufficient to cover the surface of the dish, and return the dish to the incubator. - xi. After ~ 5 min, look at the cells under a microscope to see if cells in colonies have rounded. If not, incubate further. Once the cells in the colony have rounded, but are still attached, they can be picked. - xii. Use a permanent marker to circle small groups of colonies on the bottom of the dish. This helps to keep track of which colonies have already been harvested. - xiii. Using a fresh 200 -μL pipette tip per colony, scrape two to three times over the colony while aspirating 10 μL into the pipette <b>tip.</b> <b>Insert</b> the pipette tip into the well of a 96 -well plate, pipetting medium from the well several times into the tip to wash the cells off into the well. - xiv. Grow cells until their numbers are sufficient for screening. Screen the cells from each well, and freeze the positive clones. Examine the positive clones by microscopy for the biological activity of interest. ### DISCUSSION In general, screening of clones uses either a visual, microscope-based screen (if possible) or a molecular or biochemical screen. In some cases, both might be combined, either as two sequential screens or one parallel screen. An example from our work is a screen of a set of 96 subclones transfected with a nonfluorescent VP 16 transcriptional activator fusion protein. A visual immunofluorescence assay was used to test directly for expression of the activator, and a transient transfection expression assay was run to test the capability of each clone to activate a luciferase reporter gene. The intersection of these two screens yielded a clone that induced chromosome repositioning after induction of VP 16 targeting. A starting point for subcloning is to determine roughly what fraction of stable transformants show the desired properties. If this fraction is large, then we typically carry out the initial transformation in a single flask, followed by subsequent subcloning of the mixed stable transformant pool by serial dilution cloning into 96 -well plates. A range of dilutions should be used to ensure success. The advantage of serial dilution is that the investigator can more easily verify whether the cells in a given well actually arise from a single clone. If the fraction of desired cells is small (a few percent or less), and if a visual screen is possible, we prepare a single coverslip from the mixed pool of stable transformants and obtain an initial estimate of exactly how many clones need to be screened. One approach is to initially subclone in pools of clones (e. g., five to 10 per well). In theory, this should allow cloning of even rare transformants through several stages of subcloning. Often, however, the desired subclones are rare because of a selective bias against growth of these clones. In this case, if the pool size is too great, the percentage of desired cells can drop in the culture prior to the next stage of subcloning, producing diminishing returns. A better approach, where possible, is cell sorting with flow cytometry to enrich the cell population with cells containing the desired expression levels (see Step 6 above). When large numbers of clones are required, and if visual screening is unnecessary, we simply pick large numbers of colonies from a 150 -mm-diameter Petri dish, using either small, trypsin-soaked pieces of filter paper (Steps 8. i- 8. ix above) or micropipette tips (Steps 8. x- 8. xiv above). These are used to deposit clonal cells into 96 -well plates. Both methods are very rapid but have a high risk of clone contamination, due to the use of a single Petri dish. Any clones selected, based on a secondary screen, must go through an additiona...|$|E

It was found that the surface roughness can be improved when using tools with appropriate chip breakers and a specially designed corner geometry. In addition forming of micropores could be reduced by using tools with a smaller corner radius, which leads to higher compressive stresses in the surface layer during cutting. All tests were carried out with diamond <b>tipped</b> <b>inserts</b> on a precision lathe with emulsion as the cooling lubricant...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{document}} the 1 -year safety, efficacy, and stability results of 355 eyes {{treated in the}} multi-center study of conductive keratoplasty (CK) used to correct low to moderate hyperopia. Design: Nonrandomized comparative (self-controlled) trial. Participants: Twenty surgeons at 13 centers performed CK on the eyes of all patients enrolled in a multicenter, 2 -year, U. S. phase III clinical trial. Treated eyes had 0. 75 to 3. 00 diopters (D) of hyperopia and 0. 75 D of cylinder. Patients were 40 {{years of age or}} older. Intervention: Low-energy, high-frequency current was applied directly into the peripheral corneal stroma through a delivery <b>tip</b> <b>inserted</b> at 8 to 32 treatment spots. The number of treatment spots was increased for increasing levels of hyperopia, but the amount of radiofrequency energy remained constant. Emmetropia was intended. All eyes were treated once (there were no retreatments). Main Outcome Measures: Data from 355 eyes with 1 year of follow-up were analyzed for safety and stability, and data from 318 eyes were analyzed for efficacy and predictability, as well as stability and safety. All patients reported on satisfaction and quality of vision after surgery. Results: At 1 year, uncorrected visual acuity was 20 / 20 in 56 %, 20 / 25 in 75 %, and 20 / 40 in 92 % of eyes.

DESIGN: Prospective randomized study. SETTING: Operating room of a university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: 90 ASA physical status 1 and 2 adults, aged 18 to 72 years, scheduled for orthodontia surgery requiring nasotracheal intubation. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to three groups to undergo tracheal intubation with a Macintosh laryngoscope (Group Mac; n = 30), AWS with its <b>tip</b> <b>inserted</b> into the vallecula for indirect elevation of the epiglottis (Group AWS-I; n = 30), or AWS with its tip positioned posterior to the epiglottis for direct elevation of the epiglottis (Group AWS-D; n = 30). MEASUREMENTS: Percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score at the time of laryngeal exposure, time required for intubation, and intubation difficulty scale (IDS) were measured. The frequency of postoperative sore throat and hoarseness also were noted. MAIN RESULTS: Patient demographics did not differ among the groups. In Groups AWS-I and AWS-D, IDS scores were reduced significantly, and the percentages of glottic opening were significantly improved, compared with the Macintosh group. Time to place the endotracheal tube was significantly shortest in Group AWS-I. In one case from each group, intubation within two attempts failed and a different approach was required. CONCLUSION: The AWS offers better intubation conditions than the Macintosh laryngoscope during nasotracheal intubation. The AWS may be used to elevate the epiglottis both directly and indirectly for nasotracheal intubation...|$|R
40|$|An {{economic}} semiautomatic pipet {{is described}} with its applications. The accuracy of this pipet {{falls within the}} tolerances established by the American Chemical Society Committee on Microchemical Apparatus. USTED et al. reported recently {{on the use of}} an electronic fibrin switch for the determination of prothrombin time (1). We have made similar observations and drawn the same conclusions, using this instru-ment (Fibrometer*). It occurred to us that the semiautomatic pipet employed for the measurement of plasma as well as reagents in the determination of prothrombin time might easily be adapted to clinical chemistry procedures. We were able to obtain this semiautomatic pipet without its electrical attachments. This modification of the original instrument is called the noneiectric automatic pipet, but we prefer the name “governor pipet. ” The pipet is a plastic gun-shaped device with a stainless steel nozzle alld a plastic plunger that is operated by thumb depression (Fig. 1). The plunger can be rotated to set delivery of 100 - or 200 -l. quantities (Fig. 2 and 3). The plunger fits in the metal nozzle and is fitted with an “ 0 ” ring seal.

It is also available at: [URL] dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the atomic-scale stick-slip phenomenon of a pyramidal diamond <b>tip</b> <b>inserted</b> into the Ag(010) surface. The mechanisms behind the stick-slip events are investigated by considering sliding speeds between 1. 0 and 5. 0 ms- 1 and vertical support displacements of 5 and 15 Å. The analysis of the dynamic features of the substrate shows that dislocations are extrinsically linked to the stick events, with the emission of a dislocation in the substrate region near the tip, when slip occurs after stick. For small vertical displacements, the scratch in the substrate is not continuous because the tip can jump over the surface when slipping, whereas at 15 Å, a continuous scratch is formed. The dynamic friction coefficient increases from ∼ 0. 13 to ∼ 0. 46 with increasing depth, but the static friction coefficient increases only from ∼ 0. 32 to ∼ 0. 54. At the larger depths the tip does not come to a halt during stick as it does for shallow indents. Instead the tip motion is more continuous with stick and slip manifested by periods of faster and slower motion. Although the exact points of stick and slip depend on the sliding speed, the damage to the substrate, the atomistic stick-slip mechanisms, and the friction coefficients are relatively independent of speed over the range of values considered...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Conductive {{keratoplasty}} (CK) is {{a surgical}} technique that delivers radio frequency (350 kHz) current {{directly into the}} corneal stroma through a Keratoplasty <b>tip</b> <b>inserted</b> into the peripheral cornea at 8 to 32 treatment points. A full circle of CK spots produces a cinching effect that increases the curvature of the central cornea, thereby decreasing hyperopia. We report here the 12 -month results of a 2 -year, prospective, multicenter US clinical trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and stability of CK. METHODS: A total of 233 patients (401 eyes) with preoperative hyperopia of + 0. 75 to + 3. 00 D and < or = 0. 75 D of astigmatism (mean preoperative manifest refractive spherical equivalent = + 1. 76 D +/- 0. 60) were enrolled into the study at 13 centers and underwent CK treatment. RESULTS: Twelve-month postoperative data are available on 203 eyes for safety and stability and 171 eyes for safety, stability, and efficacy. A total of 91 % had uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 20 / 40 or better, and 51 % had UCVA of 20 / 20 or better. Manifest refractive spherical equivalent was within +/- 0. 50 D in 58 %, within +/- 1. 00 D in 91 %, and within +/- 2. 00 D in 99 %. The mean change in residual refraction was 0. 26 D +/- 0. 49 between 3 and 6 months, 0. 09 D +/- 0. 37 between 6 and 9 months, and 0. 13 D +/- 0. 39 between 9 and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: One-year data show safety and efficacy of CK {{in the treatment of}} hyperopia. Changes in residual refractive error after CK appeared to be small, suggesting that a stable refraction could be achieved by 6 months...|$|R
40|$|The {{damage to}} air {{preheater}} (APH) tubes in the zones where air and gas temperatures are low discovered in CFB boilers at Estonian oil shale power plants was indicative of low-temperature corrosion (LTC). To establish damage causes, samples of ash deposits from boiler heating surfaces and APH corroded tubes were collected and chemically analysed, visual observations were conducted, dew point of flue gas was experimentally determined and deposit {{samples were collected}} also in the gas flue of a working boiler. The measured dew-point temperature of sulphuric acid in a pulverized firing (PF) boiler is 75 – 80 °C. The maximum chlorine content of the deposits collected from a probe <b>tip</b> <b>inserted</b> in a PF boiler’s gas flue is ~ 6 %. The measured dew-point temperature in a CFB boiler’s gas flue is 55 – 60 °C. If the probe tip was contaminated, dew-point temperature rose to 75 – 80 °C. Chlorine content of the deposit samples collected from a CFB boiler was ~ 3 %. The estimated dew-point temperature of water steam with no sulphur in flue gas was 52. 0 – 53. 4 °C in the following conditions: Qri = 8. 30 – 8. 50 MJ/kg, Wri = 11 – 14 % and α = 1. 20 (O 2 = 3. 5 %). Possible LTC causes were analysed and recommendations were offered concerning implementation of measures to reduce LTC. It became evident that the temperature of APH tube walls fell below the dew-point temperature of oil shale flue gas, causing condensation of the water steam present in flue gas on the tubes.
