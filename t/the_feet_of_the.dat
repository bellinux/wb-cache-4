5|$|On {{arrival at}} Seringapatam the Christian captives {{were forced to}} embrace Islam. All those who {{complied}} were freed. Those who refused were tied to <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elephants to be dragged and trampled on Tipu's orders.|$|E
5|$|By all accounts, Kanhopatra then died at <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vithoba image, but the {{circumstances}} were unclear. According to popular tradition, Kanhopatra {{merged with the}} image of Vithoba in a form of marriage—something that Kanhopatra longed for. Other theories suggest that she killed herself, or that she was killed for her rebelliousness.|$|E
60|$|Forester {{turned back}} and {{advanced}} to <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bed. There was a high foot-board at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bed, and Forester leaned upon it with the lamp in his hand.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, infill at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope has a {{stabilising}} {{effect on}} a translational or deep rotational landslide, in which the landslide surface at the top submerges and describes a sub-vertical surface that re-emerges in <b>the</b> area at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope. <b>The</b> process <b>of</b> infill at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope may include construction of berms, gravitational structures such as gabions, or reinforced ground (i.e., concrete blocks).|$|R
5000|$|Outer Continental Shelf limits {{greater than}} 200 {{nautical}} miles {{but less than}} either the 2,500-meter isobath plus 100 nmi or 350 nmi are defined by a line [...] seaward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continental slope or by a line seaward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continental slope connecting points where the sediment thickness divided by <b>the</b> distance to <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope equals 0.01, whichever is farthest.|$|R
5|$|Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now {{an escaped}} {{political}} prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel – his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left {{a key to the}} chapel hidden at <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds.|$|E
5|$|The Maundy Dish {{is one of}} six used by the Queen at Royal Maundy for {{handing out}} alms to elderly people in {{recognition}} of their service {{to the church and}} local community. The ceremony, which takes place in a different cathedral every year, entirely replaced the ancient custom of washing <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor in 1730, and the dish, though it bears the royal cypher of William and Mary, dates from the reign of CharlesII. Two purses containing specially minted coins are taken from the dish and presented to each recipient.|$|E
5|$|As {{bishop and}} archbishop, Oswald was a {{supporter}} {{and one of}} the leading promoters (together with Æthelwold) of Dunstan's reforms of the church, including monastic reforms. Oswald founded a number of monasteries, including Ramsey Abbey, and reformed other seven, including Winchcombe in Gloucestershire and Pershore and Evesham in Worcestershire. Oswald also switched the cathedral chapter of Worcester from secular clergy to monks. While archbishop, he brought the scholar Abbo of Fleury to teach, and he spent two years in England, mostly at Ramsey. Oswald died in 992, while washing <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor. A hagiographical life was written shortly after his death, and he was quickly hailed as a saint.|$|E
25|$|The {{manor house}} {{is laid out}} symmetrically. It is 33 meters from <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stairs to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower, and 33 meters from <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stairs to the main gate portal.|$|R
50|$|Generally, areas above 3,000 metres {{are covered}} by glaciers, the two largest being the Ried Glacier {{situated}} at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nadelgrat and the Fee Glacier, at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dom itself, below the east face.|$|R
50|$|It {{is an easy}} {{climb and}} an {{excellent}} starting course. The climb from <b>the</b> bivouac to <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier <b>of</b> Etançons takes 2½ hour. From <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier to the summit takes 1¼ hours.|$|R
5|$|From 1953 to 1961 Grant {{immersed}} {{himself in}} the study of Hinduism, becoming a follower of the Hindu guru Ramana Maharshi. He was also interested in the work of another Hindu teacher, Lord Kusuma Haranath, and was credited with encouraging and helping to create the three-volume Lord Haranath: A Biography by Akella Ramakrishna Sastri. He also authored articles on Advaita Vedanta and other Hindu topics for Indian journals like the Bombay-based The Call Divine, as well as for Richard Cavendish's Man, Myth & Magic. Many of these articles would be collected into a single anthology and published as At <b>the</b> <b>Feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Guru in 2005. Grant believed that the O.T.O.'s sex magic teachings needed to be refashioned along tantric principles from Indian religion, in doing so relying heavily on Curwen's ideas about tantra.|$|E
5|$|Oswald died on 29 February 992 {{in the act}} of washing <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor at Worcester, as was {{his daily}} custom during Lent, and was buried in the Church of Saint Mary at Worcester. He {{promoted}} the education of the clergy and persuaded scholars to come from Fleury and teach in England. A Life of Oswald was written after his death, probably by Byrhtferth, a monk of Ramsey Abbey. Two manuscripts, a psalter (Harley MS 2904 in the British Library) and a pontifical (MS 100, part 2 from Sidney Sussex College of Cambridge University), probably belonged to Oswald and would have been used in his daily devotions.|$|E
5|$|Silkies {{are also}} known for their polydactyly, usually manifesting as an {{additional}} 1-2 digits in the foot. The genetic cause of this extra digit formation {{has been shown to}} be a SNP in a regulator of the SHH gene, called the ZPA Regulatory Sequence (ZRS). This causes ectopic SHH expression in the anterior of the developing limb bud, leading to increased tissue growth and digits. Interestingly, while <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Silkie display polydactyly, the wings have the standard tridactyly (three digit) arrangement. The Japanese Silkie initially develops additional digits in the wing as an embryo, but these are lost prior to hatching. The genetic cause behind Silkie polydactyly differs from those that cause polydactyly in the Dorking chicken breed, which is due to ectopic FGF4 expression in the AER, with ectopic SHH a secondary effect.|$|E

5000|$|On 27 April 2009 at the Australian Christian Churches National Conference, Southern Cross College officially {{changed it}} name to Alphacrucis. The new name {{derives from the}} star that sits at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern Cross {{constellation}} named Alpha Crucis. The principal, Stephen Fogarty, says, “Alphacrucis is {{the brightest star in}} the Southern Cross, and it’s at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross. … We want our students to shine brightly at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Field {{trips to}} Pace University are called [...] "the bridge to bridge walk" [...] because Pace High School {{is located at}} <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan Bridge, and Pace University is located at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brooklyn Bridge (a 10-15 minute walk).|$|R
5|$|The Motmot Capstone is an inscribed {{stone that}} was placed over a tomb under Structure 10L-26. Its face was finely sculpted with {{portraits of the}} first two kings of the Copán dynasty, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol, facing towards each other with a double column of hieroglyphs between them, all {{contained}} within a quatrefoil frame. The frame and the hieroglyphic names of mythological locations underneath <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two kings place them in a supernatural realm. The capstone bears two calendrical dates, in AD435 and AD441. The second of these is probably the date that the capstone was dedicated.|$|E
5|$|The National Trust {{took control}} of the Tor in 1933, but repairs were delayed until after the Second World War. During the 1960s, {{excavations}} identified cracks in the rock, suggesting the ground had moved in the past. This, combined with wind erosion, started to expose the footings of the tower, which were repaired with concrete. Erosion caused by <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increasing number of visitors was also a problem and paths were laid to enable them to reach the summit without damaging the terraces. After 2000, enhancements to the access and repairs to the tower, including rebuilding of the parapet, were carried out. These included the replacement of some of the masonry damaged by earlier repairs with new stone from the Hadspen Quarry.|$|E
5|$|Minor actions {{continued}} into the night, with small groups of Viet Cong able to pop up undetected and then disappear at will from within the Australian defensive position. The searching units were unable to locate Viet Cong in large numbers but experienced {{a significant number of}} sudden engagements and ambushes throughout the day, and {{it became clear that the}} communists were using tunnels for movement and concealment. Preece suspected that the area was honeycombed with tunnels and that the communist headquarters that he had been tasked to destroy was in fact located beneath <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battalion. The Australians were the only battalion in the US 173rd Brigade to strike significant resistance, and by the end of the first day 1 RAR had suffered a total of three killed and 15 wounded, while the artillery Forward Observer from 105 Field Battery had also been killed. The battalion spent a sleepless night and in the early hours of the morning there were a number of short exchanges of fire as small groups of Viet Cong returned to the area. Not wanting to fire the machine-guns for fear of giving their positions away or hitting friendly troops, the Australians resorted to using grenades forward of the perimeter. Meanwhile, in the US 3rd Infantry Brigade area of operations contact had been light, with only six Viet Cong killed.|$|E

For attachment, screws are used on wooden booms and screws or rivets on aluminium booms. If <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sail {{is attached to the}} boom, there may be hoops from <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sail, around the boom, or there may be a track on <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boom into which fittings on <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sail are slid.|$|R

5|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{the spotted}} green pigeon was not recorded, but theories {{have been proposed}} based on its physical features. Gibbs found the delicate, part-feathered legs and long tail indicative of at least partially arboreal habits. After noting that the wings were not short after all, van Grouw stated that the bird {{would not have been}} terrestrial, unlike the related Nicobar pigeon. He pointed out that the overall proportions and shape of the bird (longer tail, shorter legs, primary feathers probably reaching the middle of the tail) was more similar to the pigeons of the genus Ducula. It may therefore have been ecologically similar to those birds, have likewise been strongly arboreal, and kept to the dense canopy of forests. By contrast, the mainly terrestrial Nicobar pigeon forages on the forest floor. The dark eyes of the Nicobar pigeon are typical of species that forage on forest floors, whereas the coloured bill and presumably coloured eyes of the spotted green pigeon {{are similar to those of}} frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons. <b>The</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spotted green pigeon are also similar to those of pigeons that forage in trees. The slender bill indicates that it fed on soft fruits.|$|E
