40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the implications for}} regulatory competition of {{the judgment of the}} European Court of Justice in Laval. This case is potentially the most important decision on European labour law for a generation. The Court has greatly extended the scope for judicial review of state-level labour laws {{on the grounds that they}} restrict freedom of movement from one member state to another. It has also undermined the principle of the <b>territorial</b> <b>effect</b> of labour legislation and has given a strictly pre-emptive interpretation to social policy directives. The Laval judgment is, however, open to attack on a number of grounds. It fails to mount a coherent economic case for judicial intervention on the scale envisaged, and is, more generally, incompatible with the recent experimentalist or reflexive turn in European governance represented by the open method of coordination...|$|E
40|$|We analyze {{geographic}} inequality {{of access}} to employment at a highly detailed geographic level - the municipality - across all of metropolitan France (mainland + Corsica), for two population groups: unemployed persons registered at the National Employment Agency (ANPE) and recipients of the guaranteed minimum income (RMI). Overall, we find highly pronounced inequality of employment access by municipality of residence. However, across large sections of metropolitan France, groups of contiguous municipalities offer uniformly low or high prospects of employment access. Divergences between localities remain wide when we neutralize inter-municipal differences in socio-demographic composition: this finding confirms {{the existence of a}} specific <b>territorial</b> <b>effect.</b> To explain it, we introduce theoretical determinants of spatial economy into the analysis. The location of economic activities and issues of physical distance from the workplace do indeed have a strong impact, but geographic inequality of employment access may also be due to residential-segregation and social-network effects.

40|$|Translating the European agro-environmental {{policy at}} a local scale implies costs of implementation, {{especially}} when a local cohesion is required. In the case of agro-environmental schemes (AES), farmers are supposed to contract individually and voluntarily but a <b>territorial</b> <b>effect</b> is expected. Then, {{the effectiveness of the}} policy depends on the coordination of the individuals' plans. In this paper, we assume that local institutions such as french 'Parcs Naturels R 9 gionaux' can have a key role in this coordination. We suppose that their knowledge of the territory and their proximity with the local population allow them to adapt pertinently the policy. To address this issue empirically, we questioned 120 farmers about (i) the cost due to the contract and (ii) their perception of AES, both within and outside of three French 'Parcs Naturels R 9 gionaux' (Morvan, Livradois-Forez et Volcans d'Auvergne).

40|$|The aim of our {{research}} is to explain spatial disparities of unemployment-to-work transitions in Paris region (Île-de-France). We are using exhaustive administrative data sets concerning unemployed seeking a job within the French civil service (through Agence nationale pour l?emploi) in order to estimate duration models that allow to assess unemployment-to-work hazard rates for each Paris region?s municipalities. The region shows very strong local disparities between municipalities even if we control for differences in terms of age, sex, skills. This confirms {{the existence of a}} specific <b>territorial</b> <b>effect.</b> The region displays a concentric logical: in the center and in the far away periphery, unemployment-to-work transitions are rarer than in an intermediate area. The farthest municipalities from the center are generally characterized by high unemployment duration. In order to explain this geography, we are interesting to the effects of the urban structure on unemployment-to-work transitions.

40|$|Cyber-attacks {{have become}} {{increasingly}} common in recent years. Capable of shutting down nuclear centrifuges, air defense systems, and electrical grids, cyber-attacks pose {{a serious threat to}} national security. As a result, some have suggested that cyber-attacks should be treated as acts of war. Yet the attacks look little like the armed attacks that the law of war has traditionally regulated. This Article examines how existing law may be applied-and adapted and amended-to meet the distinctive challenge posed by cyber-attacks. It begins by clarifying what cyber-attacks are and how they already are regulated by existing bodies of law, including the law of war, international treaties, and domestic criminal law. This review makes clear that existing law effectively addresses {{only a small fraction of}} potential cyber-attacks. The law of war, for example, provides a useful framework for only the very small number of cyber-attacks that amount to an armed attack or that take place in the context of an ongoing armed conflict. This Article concludes that a new, comprehensive legal framework at both the domestic and international levels is needed to more effectively address cyber- attacks. The United States could strengthen its domestic law by giving domestic criminal laws addressing cyber-attacks extra- <b>territorial</b> <b>effect</b> and by adopting limited, internationally permissible countermeasures to combat cyber-attacks that do not rise to the level of armed attacks or that do not take place during an ongoing armed conflict. Yet the challenge cannot be met by domestic reforms alone. International cooperation will be essential to a truly effective legal response. New international efforts to regulate cyber-attacks must begin with agreement on the problem-which means agreement on the definition of cyber-attack, cyber-crime, and cyber-warfare. This would form the foundation for greater international cooperation on information sharing, evidence collection, and criminal prosecution of those involved in cyber-attacks-in short, for a new international law of cyber-attack...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the current}} thesis, the {{influence}} of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation onto the expression of eight Ras-dependent regulated genes was investigated in immortalized (208 F) and Hras-transformed (FE- 8) rat fibroblasts. All genes are target genes of the Raf/MEK/ERK-signal transduction pathway in FE- 8 cells and are suppressed through an activated pathway. Upon pharmacological inhibition of the pathway, the genes get re-expressed. Clusterin, Loxl 2, Mmp 2, Thbs 1, Timp 2 and Lgals 3 bp also became upregulated in the Hras-transformed cells upon treatment with the demethylating agent 5 -Aza-CdR. In contrast to preliminary investigations, Fstl 1 was not upregulated and Lox was even further suppressed by 5 -Aza-CdR. Inhibition of Histon deacetylases by Trichostatin A resulted in an upregulation of Clusterin, Loxl 2, Mmp 2, Thbs 1 and Timp 2. The expression of Lox and Lgals 3 bp was suppressed; the expression of Fstl 1 was not influenced. siRNA against DNMT 1 in the Hras-transformed cells resulted in a re-expression of Clusterin and Mmp 2, the other genes were not analysed. These experiments suggest an involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the suppression of genes following Ras transformation. For the Clusterin gene, a methylation-dependent regulation could indeed be proven [Lund et al., 2006], while Loxl 2, Mmp 2, Thbs 1 and Timp 2 {{are likely to be}} regulated indirectly via DNA methylation. A <b>territorial</b> <b>effect</b> on DNA with higher-ranking regulatory elements mediating an epigenetic regulation was postulated for Timp 2 and Lgals 3 bp: both genes are located on chromosome 10 q 32. 3 with no other coding regions in between. The mechanism of RAS-dependent epigenetic regulation is unclear, however DNMT 1 must be discussed as one of the key enzymes. An involvement in transformation or tumour genesis is already known for most of the genes investigated.

40|$|International audienceQuestions {{about the}} links between {{investments}} in transport infrastructure and regional development is a longstanding topic for spatial planners, specifically economists. According to several transport and urbanism specialists, economic effects induced by transport infrastructures are not defined by a deterministic relationship. Moreover, the complexity of transport impacts on development leads Plassard, amongst others, to consider the significance of territorial (not only economic) effects. In this context, instead of producing economic predictions, this work proposes a measure of <b>territorial</b> <b>effects</b> of a new transport infrastructure in a forecasting approach. So, {{the aim of this}} research is to build a tool for decision support in planning and transport policy that can show the potential of transport networks to provide the structure of a regional or metropolitan area. This doesn’t mean to replace an economic analysis, but rather to provide further and complementary information to the decision-makers. For instance, french LGV (high-speed train lines) are obviously major tools for development at regional scale. In PACA (Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur) region, the project {{can be seen as a}} future backbone to economic and social relations between Aix-Marseille metropolitan area and Côte d’Azur conurbation (around Nice). Nonetheless, within these two City-regions, LGV can be used as another transport service, thereby support local (urban) relations. To assess this double role of LGV, transport service, understood as the set of speed, schedule and fineness (number of train stops) has to be modelled. Modelling approach is based on a transport-oriented GIS using scheduled graph to represent transport service as previously defined. The model uses scheduled accessibility and path capillarity to define <b>territorial</b> <b>effects</b> of a given transport service. Scheduled accessibility gives disaggregated spatiotemporal distance between two places whereas path capillarity represents the fineness of transport service, i. e. potential for small scale use of the transport service. The confrontation of these two indicators can give an idea of the tension between speed and territorial potential. Indeed, a fine metropolitan service will necessarily damage trip speed at regional scale. At the opposite, a looser transport service (removal of a train stop), involves a speed gain...|$|R
