5|$|Another common {{trick was}} to swallow 30 to 50 unshelled {{hazelnuts}} (although {{one of his}} posters advertised 40 pecans), followed by another nut of a different variety, such as an almond. Ali then brought <b>them</b> <b>up</b> one by one with the odd-nut-out produced at a mark called out by the audience. In another trick, Ali swallowed three to six handkerchiefs of different hues and then produced them in a color order requested by audience members.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push <b>them</b> <b>up</b> the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Wurster's and Ganzert's visit to the site, the entire bridge was buried by river sediments up to the {{springing}} line of the vaults. No efforts to dig <b>them</b> <b>up</b> were undertaken by Wurster and Ganzert. Only two of the 28 arches were exposed enough so that direct measurements of the clear span and the pier width could be undertaken. It was, however, possible to calculate {{the dimensions of the}} remaining bays from their exposed sections.|$|E
5|$|Bolton were relegated on goal {{difference}} {{at the end}} of the 1997–98 Premiership campaign. They finished on the same number of points as Everton, whom they faced in the first competitive match at the newly built Reebok Stadium. The game finished 0–0, but a goal by Gerry Taggart for the Whites was mistakenly not given; the point swing in Bolton's favour would have kept <b>them</b> <b>up.</b> The following season they reached the 1999 Division One play-off Final but lost 2–0 to Watford.|$|E
5|$|Days {{after the}} spill, tar balls began washing ashore on beaches {{down the coast}} in nearby Summerland and then farther down the coast in Ventura county. Although the source of these tar balls could not be {{immediately}} confirmed, the pipeline company sent workers to clean <b>them</b> <b>up.</b> Crews cleaned up coin-sized clumps of oil along the Rincon shoreline such as Faria, the beaches in the City of Ventura including San Buenaventura State Beach, and the extensive oceanfront of the Oxnard Plain.|$|E

5|$|Don Calò further {{established}} his fortune in 1922 {{when he led}} disgruntled peasants who grabbed land from the aristocratic absentee landlords. Vizzini bought three estates in the Villalba region; he divided <b>them</b> <b>up</b> and handed them over – allegedly without making a penny, according to some – to a cooperative he had founded. According to a local villager, although every peasant got a plot, Don Calò kept more than 12,000 acres (49km²) for himself.|$|E
5|$|Early on May 6, three Royal Navy ships sailed into Quebec Harbour. Troops {{on these}} ships were {{immediately}} sent {{into the city}} and, not long after, General Guy Carleton formed <b>them</b> <b>up</b> and marched {{them out to the}} American siege camp. General John Thomas, then in command of the American forces, had already been making arrangements to retreat, but the British arrival threw his troops into a panic. He led a disorganized retreat that eventually reached Sorel on about May 18.|$|E
5|$|I {{had little}} hopes on Monday last {{but to have}} supped in your cabin: but it pleased God to order it otherwise. I am thankful for it. As for those cowardly captains who deserted you, hang <b>them</b> <b>up,</b> for by God they deserve it.|$|E

50|$|From the cemetery, {{teams were}} {{directed}} to a marked carpenter's shop in Kayar. At the shop was the next Detour, a choice between Stack <b>'Em</b> <b>Up</b> or Pull <b>'Em</b> <b>Up.</b> In Stack <b>'Em</b> <b>Up,</b> teams had to stack enough fish to properly cover a drying table. Once the table was properly covered, the fisherwoman would hand them their next clue. In Pull <b>'Em</b> <b>Up,</b> teams traveled on fishing boats and used traditional fishing gear to catch four fish. When they brought the four fish to a bounty man on the shore, he would give them their next clue.|$|R
5000|$|Shoot <b>'em</b> <b>up</b> (also {{known as}} shmup or STG) is a subgenre of the shooter genre of video games. In a shoot <b>'em</b> <b>up,</b> the player {{character}} engages in a lone assault, {{often in a}} spacecraft or aircraft, shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot <b>'em</b> <b>up.</b> Some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement; others allow a broader definition including characters on foot {{and a variety of}} perspectives. Shoot <b>'em</b> <b>ups</b> call for fast reactions and for the player to memorize levels and enemy attack patterns. [...] "Bullet hell" [...] games feature overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles.|$|R
5|$|Later, {{she lets}} them outside again, but this time, Russetfur walks in on them. Instead of {{forcing her to}} give <b>them</b> <b>up</b> to ShadowClan, she instead helps Sasha by giving her some prey, and warns her to leave as soon as possible. Later on, Sasha goes out hunting and the kits go out to find Ken {{because they want to}} make their mother happy.|$|E
5|$|Lon Nol {{hoped to}} use the Vietnamese as hostages against PAVN/Viet Cong activities, and the {{military}} set about rounding <b>them</b> <b>up</b> into detention camps.

On 15 April, the bodies of 800 Vietnamese floated down the Mekong River and into South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 1956 two FDA {{officials}} {{arrived at}} Orgonon {{to supervise the}} destruction of the accumulators. Most of them had been sold by that time and another 50 were with Silvert in New York. Only three were at Orgonon. The FDA agents were not allowed to destroy them, only to supervise the destruction, so Reich's friends and his son, Peter, chopped <b>them</b> <b>up</b> with axes as the agents watched. Once they were destroyed, Reich placed an American flag on top of them.|$|E

The battle is remembered {{as one of the}} most costly and brutal battles of the war.|$|E
5|$|The Marietta-class {{monitors}} were {{a pair of}} ironclad river monitors {{laid down}} {{in the summer of}} 1862 for the United States Navy during the American Civil War. Construction was slow, partially for lack of labor, and the ships were not completed until December 1865, after the war was over.

5|$|The joint {{production}} possibilities {{set at the}} extreme right shows {{the total amount of}} both commodities that can be produced by Crusoe and Friday together. It combines the best of both workers. If both of them work to gather coconuts only, the economy will have 144 coconuts in all, 96 from Crusoe and 48 from Friday.

5|$|When Sunday {{began to}} attract crowds larger {{than could be}} {{accommodated}} in rural churches or town halls, he pitched rented canvas tents. Again, Sunday did much of the physical work of putting <b>them</b> <b>up,</b> manipulating ropes during storms, and seeing to their security by sleeping in them at night. Not until 1905 was he well-off enough to hire his own advance man.|$|E
5|$|A crew of over 200 craftspeople and {{technicians}} constructed the three principal sets: {{the surface of}} the alien planetoid, and the interiors of the Nostromo and the derelict spacecraft. Art Director Les Dilley created -scale miniatures of the planetoid's surface and derelict spacecraft based on Giger's designs, then made moulds and casts and scaled <b>them</b> <b>up</b> as diagrams for the wood and fiberglass forms of the sets. Tons of sand, plaster, fiberglass, rock, and gravel were shipped into the studio to sculpt a desert landscape for the planetoid's surface, which the actors would walk across wearing space suit costumes. The suits themselves were thick, bulky, and lined with nylon, had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled carbon dioxide to escape. Combined with a heat wave, these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out: nurses had to be kept on-hand with oxygen tanks.|$|E
