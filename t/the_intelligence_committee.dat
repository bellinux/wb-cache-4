500|$|Following {{his primary}} {{challenge}} to Schmidt, McEwen {{worked as a}} lobbyist for Côte d'Ivoire strongman Laurent Gbagbo. [...] "In December , McEwen was hired {{at a rate of}} $25,000 per month to assist the Ivorian ambassador to the U.S. 'in exerting his influence in the most strategic way possible,' according to lobbying records." [...] When asked about his representation of Gbagbo, McEwen said: [...] "I was a member of <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>committee.</b> There are not too many places in Africa I haven't been. So I'm knowledgeable of the issue and what's going on." [...] "Despite allegations of human rights abuses, McEwen still supports Gbagbo, calling the 2010 crisis 'a coup in progress' by Gbagbo's opponents. He believes the international response is driven by French financial interests in the country." ...|$|E

50|$|President Bush {{stated that}} he had {{reviewed}} and reauthorized the program approximately every 45 days since it was implemented. The leadership of <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>committees</b> of <b>the</b> House or Representatives and Senate were briefed {{a number of times}} since initiation of the program. They were not, however, allowed to make notes or confer with others to determine the legal ramifications, or even to mention the existence of the program to the full membership of <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>committees.</b> Further, <b>the</b> administration even refused to identify to the public which members of the committees were briefed; it has, however, provided a complete list of these members to <b>the</b> Senate <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Committee.</b>|$|R
50|$|Investigations {{were started}} by the FBI, <b>the</b> Senate <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Committee</b> and <b>the</b> House <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Committee.</b> In May 2017, former FBI Director Robert Mueller was {{appointed}} as special counsel in the FBI's investigation.|$|R
500|$|McEwen {{was caught}} up in the House banking scandal, which had been seized upon by Newt Gingrich, a like-minded {{conservative}} House Republican, {{as an example of the}} corruption of Congress; members of the House had been allowed to write checks on their accounts, which were paid despite insufficient funds and without penalty. Martin Gottlieb of the Dayton Daily News said [...] "McEwen was collateral damage" [...] to Gingrich's crusade. McEwen initially denied bouncing any checks. Later, he admitted he had bounced a few. Then when the full totals were released by Ethics Committee investigators, the number was revealed to have been 166 over thirty-nine months. McEwen said that he always had funds available to cover the alleged overdrafts, pointing to the policy of the House sergeant at arms, who ran the House bank, paying checks on an overdrawn account if it would not exceed the sum of the Representative's next paycheck. In 1991, McEwen had also been criticized for his use of the franking privilege and his frequent trips overseas at taxpayer expense, but McEwen defended the trips as part of his work on <b>the</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Committee</b> and in building relationships with legislatures overseas.|$|E
2500|$|He told reporters, [...] "the vice {{president}} expressed {{the concern that}} a review of what happened on September 11 would take resources and personnel away from the effort {{in the war on}} terrorism. I acknowledged that concern, and it is for that reason that <b>the</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Committee</b> is going to begin this effort, trying to limit the scope and the overall review of what happened. But clearly, I think the American people are entitled to know what happened and why." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his tenure}} as Vice-Chairman of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in 1987, Leahy showed an {{unclassified}} draft report on the Iran-Contra affair to a news reporter. [...] At a press conference, Leahy stated, [...] "Even though it was declassified, I was way too careless about it," [...] and accepted blame. [...] Disclosure of that information was against <b>the</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Committee</b> rules, and Leahy said he hastened his already planned departure from the committee {{because he was so}} angry at himself.|$|E

[...] On May 26, 2017, Chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) and Vice-Chairman Mark Warner (D-VA) both signed off on a bi-partisan subpoena for all documents, emails, telephone records and anything else responsive to {{be turned over to}} <b>the</b> Senate <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Committee.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{most recent}} change to {{exercise}} of findings occurred in <b>the</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Authorization Act of 1991, which introduced increased {{flexibility in the}} reporting requirement: findings are to be [...] "reported to <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>committees</b> as soon as possible" [...] after being approved [...] "and before the initiation of the covert action authorized by the finding." [...] As such, presidential findings {{are one of the}} primary means through which <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>committees</b> exercise their oversight of <b>the</b> government's <b>intelligence</b> operations. However, <b>the</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Authorization Act allows the President to proceed without notifying Congress if he notifies them afterwards [...] "in a timely fashion." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dianne Feinstein, {{a member}} of <b>the</b> Senate <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Committee,</b> stated that all but {{two or three of}} the members of her {{committee}} support Obama. Likewise, she criticized [...] "privacy people" [...] for not understanding the threat terrorists pose to the United States. Mike Rogers, the chair of <b>the</b> House <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Committee,</b> praised Obama's stance on NSA surveillance. Peter King, another member of <b>the</b> House <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Committee,</b> questioned <b>the</b> need for the proposed reform of NSA surveillance, but admitted that they were necessary to calm down the [...] "ACLU types".|$|R
2500|$|In 1998, {{during the}} Monica Lewinsky scandal, Condit {{publicly}} demanded that Clinton [...] "come clean" [...] on {{his relationship with}} the young woman; a video of this demand was aired almost daily during Condit's own scandal involving a relationship with intern Chandra Levy. [...] Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, interest in the Levy case declined. [...] Condit kept his seat on <b>the</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Committee,</b> retained his security clearance, and was one of a small number of members of Congress who were cleared to see the most sensitive information on the 9/11 attacks.|$|E
2500|$|On November 15, 2007, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10–9 along {{party lines}} to send an {{alternative}} measure to the full Senate {{other than the one}} <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>committee</b> had crafted with the White House. The proposal would leave to the full Senate whether or not to provide retroactive immunity to telecommunications firms that cooperated with the NSA. Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy said that granting such immunity would give the Bush administration a [...] "blank check" [...] to do what it wants without regard to the law. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the top Republican on the committee, said that court cases may be the only way Congress can learn exactly how far outside the law the administration has gone in eavesdropping in the United States. When the full Senate takes up the bill, Specter is expected to offer a compromise that would shield the companies from financial ruin but allow lawsuits to go forward by having the federal government stand in for the companies at trial.|$|E
