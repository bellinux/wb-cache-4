Very large corporations such as GE, Toyota and Sharp, and investment {{firms such as}} Goldman Sachs are making multibillion-dollar investments in clean technology.|$|E

5|$|The Shia {{majority}} {{ruled by}} the Sunni Al khalifa family since the eighteenth century have long complained of what <b>they</b> <b>call</b> systemic discrimination.

Palaeontologist Dr Matthew Roney (James Donald) is called in and deduces {{that they are}} the remnants of a group of five-million-year-old apemen, more ancient than any previous finds. One of Roney's assistants uncovers part of a metallic object. Believing it to be an unexploded bomb, <b>they</b> <b>call</b> in an army bomb disposal team.|$|E

He arrives with Daisy Johnson / Quake—a rogue agent that has only {{recently}} joined back with the team—and Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider—a demon-like vigilante and Morrow's nephew, {{as well as a}} newly developed antidote to Lucy's influence. Meanwhile, Mace is debating the anti-Inhuman Senator Ellen Nadeer on live television, who brings up the prison situation which he is not aware of. Faced with further questions from Nadeer, Mace reveals that he is an Inhuman himself.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{resampled}} {{convolution method}} that they describe for computing a numerical approximation of the curve-shortening flow, <b>they</b> <b>call</b> their method the resampled curvature scale space. They observe that this scale space is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the given shape, and assert that it uniquely determines {{the shape and}} is robust against small variations in the shape. They compare it experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a scale space for shapes, and find that the resampled curvature scale space is less computationally intensive, more robust against nonuniform noise, and less strongly influenced by small-scale shape differences.|$|E

Inspired by Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, the episode has the Doctor attempting to use time travel to alter Kazran's past and make him kinder so he will save the spaceship.|$|E
5|$|Martin, Odlyzko, and Wolfram {{investigate}} pseudoforests {{that model}} {{the dynamics of}} cellular automata. These functional graphs, which <b>they</b> <b>call</b> state transition diagrams, have one vertex for each possible configuration that the ensemble of cells of the automaton can be in, and an edge connecting each configuration to the configuration that follows it according to the automaton's rule. One can infer properties of the automaton from the structure of these diagrams, such {{as the number of}} components, length of limiting cycles, depth of the trees connecting non-limiting states to these cycles, or symmetries of the diagram. For instance, any vertex with no incoming edge corresponds to a Garden of Eden pattern and a vertex with a self-loop corresponds to a still life pattern.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse are gregarious, feeding in {{flocks of}} up to 100 birds. As a {{consequence}} of their dry diet, they need to visit water sources regularly. Drinking times vary among the species. Ten species drink at dawn, four at dusk and two at indeterminate times. When drinking, water is sucked into the beak which is then raised to let the water flow down into the crop. By repeating this procedure rapidly, enough water to last twenty four hours can be swallowed in a few seconds. As they travel to water holes, <b>they</b> <b>call</b> to {{members of their own}} species and many hundreds or thousands synchronise their arrival at the drinking site despite converging from many different locations scattered over hundreds of square miles (kilometres) of territory.|$|E

5|$|The 10th-century Persian {{geographer}} Ibn al-Faqih {{wrote of}} a local legend related {{by the people of}} Lajjun regarding the source of the abundant spring used as the town's primary water source over the ages: there is just outside al-Lajjun a large stone of round form, over which is built a dome, which <b>they</b> <b>call</b> the Mosque of Abraham. A copious stream of water flows from under the stone and it is reported that Abraham struck the stone with his staff, and there immediately flowed from it water enough to suffice for the supply {{of the people of the}} town, and also to water their lands. The spring continues to flow down to the present day.|$|E
5|$|Vedar use the Sri Lankan Tamil dialect {{peculiar}} to the region, known as Batticaloa Tamil dialect, in their {{day to day}} conversations. Vedar children also study in that language in schools. During Sadangu ceremonies, those who are possessed by spirits speak in a mixed language that <b>they</b> <b>call</b> Vedar Sinkalam(Vedar Sinhala") or Vedar Bhasai which is the Vedda language of the interior Vedas. This Vedar Sinkalam is mixed with many Tamil words, as people no longer know the language.

Megan later finds residue in Linda's eyes {{to suggest that the}} killer closed her eyes after she died, which leads them back to Linda's parents, who knew that Dave intended to propose. When <b>they</b> <b>call</b> the two into the office, Al admits he killed Dave and Linda. He had only wanted to scare them so they would not marry; however, the gun discharged, killing Linda, and in panic, he killed Dave too. After apologizing to Laura, Al is taken away. Throughout the day, Megan tries to reconnect with her daughter Lacey (Mary Mouser); however, her attempts to create a better relationship with her backfire.|$|E
