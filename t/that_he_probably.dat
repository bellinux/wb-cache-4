5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the {{childhood}} of Marco Polo until he was fifteen years old, excepting <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> spent part of his childhood in Venice. Meanwhile, Marco Polo's mother died, and an aunt and uncle raised him. He received a good education, learning mercantile subjects including foreign currency, appraising, and the handling of cargo ships; he learned little or no Latin. His father later married Floradise Polo (née Trevisan).|$|E
5|$|In that year, he {{took the}} civil service exam, likely in Chang'an. He failed, to his {{surprise}} and that of centuries of later critics. Hung concludes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> failed because his prose style {{at the time was}} too dense and obscure, while Chou suggests his failure to cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame. After this failure, he went back to traveling, this time around Shandong and Hebei.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 2004, Downey {{released}} his debut musical album, The Futurist, on Sony Classical, {{for which he}} designed the cover art and designed the track listing label on the CD with his son Indio. The album received mixed reviews, but Downey stated in 2006 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> will not do another album, as {{he felt that the}} energy he put into doing the album was not compensated.|$|E

5|$|Brian ends up exercising {{for hours}} {{with the help}} of Stewie, parodying Rocky Balboa in the movie Rocky IV, but realizes his test is only a few hours away. He becomes {{stressed}} at being late for his exam, so Lois persuades Peter to revive The A-Team one last time and drive Brian to his test, which is successful, and Brian arrives on time. He fails his test, but remains proud of himself for not cheating, much to the dismay of the family, who tells him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> should have cheated. Brian tries to reassure them that he finished what he started and labels his pride of that 'something', but the Griffins shoot him down for that.|$|E

25|$|Mowat and {{his second}} wife Claire spent their later years {{together}} in Port Hope, Ontario and their summers on a farm on Cape Breton Island. They attended a local Anglican church in Port Hope about monthly, Claire emphasizing that Mowat was more spiritual than religious, and Mowat stating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> believed in God the same way his dog did, and that such ceremonies were important in tying people {{to each other and}} the world.|$|E
25|$|Couhig also {{developed}} {{an interest in}} soccer. In November 1997, he purchased the New Orleans Riverboat Gamblers, a team founded in 1993, from Donnie Pate. Couhig renamed the team the New Orleans Storm and relocated it from Tad Gormley Stadium to Zephyr Field. On February 11, 2000, Couhig sold his New Orleans Zephyrs baseball team to Donald Beaver.

Graham reserved a burial spot at the Green Acres cemetery in Scottsdale, Arizona, next to Eddie Guerrero. On March 31, 2011, The Phoenix New Times reported that Graham's doctor, Hector Rodriguez-Luna, acknowledged that Graham's advanced fibrosis may be early cirrhosis {{and that he could}} live for two more years if he took Interferon—a drug to help slow his Hepatitis C—and stayed in shape. By 2012, Graham was diagnosed with third-stage liver disease and cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|Off screen, Farley {{was well}} known for his pranks {{in the offices of}} Saturday Night Live. Sandler and Farley would make late-night prank phone calls from the SNL offices in Rockefeller Center, with Sandler {{speaking}} in an old woman's voice and Farley farting into the phone and mooning cars from a limousine. He was also known to frequently get naked and do various stunts for laughs. Chris Rock once claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> saw Farley's private parts more than Farley's girlfriend did. Sandler told Conan O'Brien on The Tonight Show that NBC fired him and Farley from the show in 1995.|$|E
25|$|On 2 May 1237, Guy {{made his}} will. His {{date of death}} is unknown, but it is assumed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> died soon thereafter; {{one of the last}} living {{participants}} in the Fourth Crusade. He was succeeded by Ubertino, his son by the Burgundian Sibylla, a cousin of Guy I of Athens. The couple had also two daughters, Mabilia, who married Azzo VII d'Este, Marquess of Ferrara, and Isabella, who succeeded her brother as marchioness but died childless in 1286, leading to a dispute between her unnamed husband and Thomas Pallavicini, who seized the castle of Bodonitsa and became the new marquess.|$|E

50|$|Henry Raymond Brush {{also argued}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was <b>probably</b> English. The Dictionary of National Biography noted the {{possibility}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was Sir Richard Greenacre of Merley, {{and he may}} have derived the name by which he is known from Bromborough in Cheshire. The name Bembro appears in chronicles of the war associated with English knights, suggesting that a family of the name served in Brittany. Brush also takes the view <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was <b>probably</b> from Bromborough, as a family using that name appears in local records for the period.|$|R
25|$|Genseric {{is often}} {{regarded}} by historians {{as the most}} able barbarian leader of the Migration Period. Michael Frasseto writes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> contributed more {{to the destruction of}} Rome than any of his contemporaries. Although the barbarians controlled Hispania they still comprised a tiny minority among a much larger Hispano-Roman population, approximately 200,000 out of 6,000,000. Shortly after seizing the throne, Genseric was attacked from the rear by a large force of Suebi under the command of Heremigarius who had managed to take Lusitania. This Suebi army was defeated near Mérida and its leader Hermigario drowned in the Guadiana River while trying to flee.|$|E
25|$|While Ford's {{articles}} were denounced by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the articles explicitly condemned pogroms and violence against Jews, but blamed the Jews for provoking incidents of mass violence. None {{of this work}} was written by Ford, but he allowed his name {{to be used as}} author. According to trial testimony, he wrote almost nothing. Friends and business associates have said they warned Ford about the contents of the Independent and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> never read the articles (he claimed he only read the headlines). However, court testimony in a libel suit, brought by one of the targets of the newspaper, alleged that Ford did know about the contents of the Independent in advance of publication.|$|E
25|$|The bad {{election}} result in 2001 was quickly {{followed by a}} leadership battle between Jagland and Stoltenberg. Both Jagland, as leader, and Stoltenberg, as deputy leader, said they were open to be challenged for their positions at the party's congress in November 2002. Stoltenberg refused to say whether he would challenge Jagland for the leadership position, which was seen by political commentators as a sign <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> would seek the leadership position. In the beginning of February 2002, Jagland, who had been briefly hospitalized in January, and had a subsequent sick leave, {{said that he would}} not seek reelection as leader. In November 2002, Stoltenberg was unanimously elected new leader at the party's congress.|$|E

25|$|After over a year, Kidd {{was sent}} to England for {{questioning}} by the Parliament of England. The new Tory ministry hoped to use Kidd {{as a tool to}} discredit the Whigs who had backed him, but Kidd refused to name names, naively confident his patrons would reward his loyalty by interceding on his behalf. There is speculation <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> would have been spared had he talked. Finding Kidd politically useless, the Tory leaders sent him to stand trial before the High Court of Admiralty in London, for the charges of piracy on high seas and the murder of William Moore. Whilst awaiting trial, Kidd was confined in the infamous Newgate Prison, and wrote several letters to King William requesting clemency.|$|E
25|$|Late in 1256 (probably in December), a {{group of}} boyars, who had decided to kill Tsar Michael and replace him with his first cousin, Koloman, {{attacked}} the former, who died soon afterwards from his wounds. To further his claims, Koloman II forcibly married Michael’s widow, the daughter of Rostislav, {{but he could not}} consolidate power and was killed almost immediately. To protect his daughter, Rostislav now, early in 1257, invaded Bulgaria; it seems he was using her as an excuse to acquire the Bulgarian throne for himself. Rostislav appeared at the gates of Tărnovo and recovered his daughter; though it is sometimes stated that he briefly obtained Tărnovo, but it seems <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> never actually gained possession of the city.|$|E

However, after about 3 years of {{scarcity}} in international cricket, Kapugedera was called up for the T20I series against Pakistan in July 2015. He made his comeback with a strong note by scoring unbeaten 31 runs in the first match, eventually Sri Lanka lost the match. He scored his highest T20I score of 48* in the second match in this series. The innings was impressed by the commentators, but finally Sri Lanka lost the match and also the series.|$|E
