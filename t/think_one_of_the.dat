5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, {{they tend to be}} totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> things about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic {{within the framework of the}} drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
500|$|During the {{pre-production}} for the episode, {{the cast}} and crew realized that the Halloween conceit would allow the various cast members to wear costumes, rather than their [...] "usual, realistically plain suits". B. J. Novak called the dress-up experience [...] "fun", noting that [...] "seeing the most serious of our plotlines play out alongside such silly and bizarre visuals was, I <b>think,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most inspired ideas of the episode's writer, Greg Daniels." [...] The idea for Pam to be dressed as a cat was inspired by several unused stories, created by Gene Stupnitsky, in which [...] "Pam Beesley must disguise herself as a cat". The plot lines were vetoed by the shows writers, but Stupnitsky successfully petitioned to allow Pam to wear a cat costume.|$|E
40|$|A royal {{flush in}} poker {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ace, king, queen, jack and ten, {{all in the}} same suit. Our magic begins by having <b>the</b> spectator choose <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cards in any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four royal flushes. This choice could be by random draw or the spectator can merely <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20 cards.

30|$|The {{difficulty}} in implementing MICE lies in <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> predictor variables and interaction terms. To avoid bias and gain precision, researchers {{recommend that the}} imputation models contain—at the least—every variable {{included in the analysis}} model. However, <b>the</b> inclusion <b>of</b> interaction terms is a tedious process. A way to determine an interaction is to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variables as a grouping variable, such as gender (Graham, 2009), and then to carry out separate imputations for females and males.|$|R

A number of golfers paid tribute to Scott: Tiger Woods, Gary Player, David Duval, Lee Westwood, Blair O'Neal, Jane Park and others. Other athletes paid tribute including Robert Griffin III, Russell Wilson, Jon Lester, Lance Armstrong, Barry Sanders, J. J. Watt, David Ortiz and Sheryl Swoopes. UNC basketball coach Roy Williams called him a [...] "hero." [...] Arizona Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians said: [...] "We lost a football game but we lost more this morning.

500|$|The Battersea Power Station Community Group <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{main reasons}} for the power station's {{worldwide}} recognition is that it appeared {{on the cover of}} Pink Floyd's 1977 album Animals, on which it was photographed with the group's inflatable pink pig floating above it. The photographs were taken in early December 1976 and the inflatable pig was made by the German company Ballon Fabrik and Australian artist Jeffrey Shaw. The inflatable pig was tethered to one of the power station's southern chimneys, but broke loose from its moorings and, to the astonishment of pilots in approaching planes, drifted into the flight path of Heathrow Airport. Police helicopters tracked its course, until it landed in Kent. Video footage of the photoshoot was used in the promotional video for the song [...] "Pigs on the Wing". The album was officially launched at an event at the power station.|$|E
500|$|Although Scott had {{accepted}} the job Demme had rejected, he said: [...] "My first question was: 'What about Jonathan?' and they said: 'The original team said it's too violent.' I said, 'Okay. I'll do it.'" [...] Scott did, himself, have some uncertainty with the source material. In particular, he had difficulties with {{the ending of the}} novel, in which Lecter and Starling become lovers: [...] "I couldn't take that quantum leap emotionally on behalf of Starling. Certainly, on behalf of Hannibal—I'm sure that's been {{in the back of his}} mind for a number of years. But for Starling, no. I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attractions about Starling to Hannibal is what a straight arrow she is." [...] He also [...] "didn't buy the book from the opera scene onwards, which became like a vampire movie." [...] He asked Harris if he was [...] "married to his ending". Harris said he was not, so Scott changed it.|$|E

500|$|Leigh's death {{received}} {{widespread and}} ongoing coverage {{in both the}} Sydney and Newcastle media, possibly due to a fascination with her reduplicated name. Between 1989 and 1994, The Newcastle Herald ran at least 39 stories on Leigh, 23 of them featured on the front page. At least ten articles on the case were published in The Sydney Morning Herald during the same period. Both the extended media coverage and the theatrical plays and film the murder inspired have led to it being termed a [...] "celebrity crime", and to Leigh being {{referred to as a}} [...] "celebrity victim". In 1996 Psychologist Roger Peters attributed the media fascination to the sense of community in Stockton, and due to the crimes being committed by people not considered to be typical criminals, [...] stating [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main things is that people can identify with people involved. Had it of been a criminal from outside who stalked her and killed I think it would be long forgotten." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after, Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine Records, signed Swift to {{his newly}} formed label. Early into the album production, {{in a meeting}} where Borchetta and Swift {{discussed}} potential songs for Swift's debut album, she performed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] for Borchetta on fluke ukulele. According to Swift, as soon as Borchetta finished listening to the song, he faced Swift and said, [...] "That's your first single." [...] She responded, [...] "Well. That's how that works then." [...] Prior to that event, Swift {{did not believe that}} the song was single material. However, she followed what label executives told her and accepted that they were correct. Swift placed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] as the first track on Taylor Swift because of its importance to her. The song was eventually released as a CD single on June 19, 2006. In retrospect, Swift has said that the song [...] "is reminiscent, and it is thinking about a relationship you had and then lost. I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most powerful human emotions is what should have been and wasn't... That was a really good song to start out on, {{because a lot of people}} can relate to wanting something you can't have." [...] When the song's subject discovered it, he thought it was [...] "cool" [...] and kept friendship with Swift despite their breakup.|$|E
500|$|The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien premiered on June 1, 2009, with The Max Weinberg 7 now {{expanded}} to eight {{and referred to}} as Max Weinberg and the Tonight Show Band. [...] Andy Richter was back as an announcer, making Weinberg's role as a foil a little uncertain. [...] Gradually Weinberg and the band's roles in the comic aspects of the show began to assert themselves. On June 25, Weinberg departed The Tonight Show temporarily for four weeks to join Springsteen and band part-way through their European leg; this was conveyed on the show via a comedy bit that had his drum riser turn into a float that took him outside the studio and purportedly to the airport. [...] Weinberg returned to the show on August 3, after flying back from a Springsteen show that had ended early into the same morning in Spain. [...] Of being Tonight Show bandleader, he said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biggest thrills in my life was seeing my name {{in the same sentence}} as Doc Severinsen, who, in my view, is the gold standard for 'Tonight Show' bandleaders. There's never been anyone who did it quite near the class and the brilliance of Doc Severinsen in the original Tonight Show Band. I used to think when I was a kid what a great job that must be – you know, same place, every time, everyday. Lo and behold, here I am 40 years later, doing it. That sounds deep, deep, deep, deep, deeply satisfying to me." [...] On September 25, Weinberg left The Tonight Show again for two months, to join Springsteen and band for the final, American portion of the Working on a Dream Tour. [...] The same drum-riser-to-float comedy bit was used, except this time the float was [...] "hit" [...] and demolished by a truck just outside the studio (and airing of the segment was delayed a few days due to O'Brien legitimately injuring himself during the same show). [...] The tour wrapped on November 22, 2009, in Buffalo, New York; Weinberg was back on The Tonight Show the next day. [...] With no E Street Band projects in sight {{for at least the next}} year or two, Weinberg was left to concentrate on his bandleader role.|$|E
