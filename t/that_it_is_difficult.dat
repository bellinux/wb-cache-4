5|$|Holy Trinity Church on Boar Lane was {{constructed}} between 1721 and 1727, built to a design by William Etty. It is a Grade I listed building. The building {{has not changed}} much (although a new steeple was built in 1839 by R D Chantrell), but developments such as the Burton Arcade and the Leeds Shopping Plaza have been built so close <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to see the full exterior of the building as was once possible.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} I have found <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> if not {{impossible}} to bring to consciousness of another person {{the nature of his}} tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E

5|$|Mushrooms with an {{appearance}} similar to S.lakei {{can often be}} distinguished by their associations with trees. For example, the eastern North American species S.spraguei grows in association with Eastern White Pine. The cap of S.spraguei has red fibrils on a yellow background. S.cavipes and S.ochraceoroseus always grow with Larch. S.ponderosus, which grows in mixed coniferous forests, has a gelatinous veil. Smith and Thiers note <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to tell the difference}} between the two if S.ponderosus has lost its veil, since the colors of the species intergrade and cannot reliably be used to distinguish them. S.decipiens has a cap that is orangish to pink-orange with hairs or scales. S.caerulescens is a similar species in western North America; it can be distinguished by the strong blue staining that develops when the stem is injured.|$|E
5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to stare at}} it directly. However, during an eclipse, with {{so much of the}} Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as {{dangerous}} as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.|$|E

5|$|In the {{intervening}} months, the Ministry of Transport had withdrawn permission for further stunts to be filmed on the M40, forcing the production team {{to resort to}} alternative methods to complete the Tiger Moth sequences. The special effects department constructed a -scale model re-creation, located on the Century 21 outdoor backlot to reduce lighting discrepancies, with radio-controlled miniatures of the Tiger Moth made to replace Hughes' aircraft. Ranging from six feet (1.8m) in width to a smaller -scale for filming with the puppet characters, the replicas were unreliable and frequently crashed, but Anderson asserts that the production team successfully merged the full-sized and miniature shots so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to distinguish which aircraft is piloted by Hughes and which is remote-controlled. The scale reconstruction of the M40 bridge was aligned with a backdrop of real trees and fields to simulate the intended setting as faithfully as possible. Bad weather forced the outdoor filming to run for six weeks.|$|E
