5|$|Butterflies {{in their}} adult stage can live from {{a week to}} nearly a year {{depending}} on the species. Many species have long larval life stages while others can remain dormant in their pupal or egg stages and thereby survive winters. The Melissa Arctic (Oeneis melissa) overwinters twice as a caterpillar. Butterflies may have one or more broods per year. The number of generations per year varies from temperate to tropical regions with tropical regions showing a <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> multivoltinism.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the family}} Theridiidae weave irregular, tangled, {{three-dimensional}} webs, popularly known as cobwebs. There {{seems to be an}} evolutionary <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> a reduction in the amount of sticky silk used, leading to its total absence in some species. The construction of cobwebs is less stereotyped than that of orb-webs, and may take several days.|$|E
5|$|Paintings {{of early}} modernist {{painters}} such as Damián Domingo often {{still had a}} religious association but the art of Juan Luna and Félix Hidalgo showed a <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> political statement. The first Philippine national artist Fernando Amorsolo used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated aspects of Philippine culture, while other artists such as Fernando Zóbel used both realistic and abstract techniques.|$|E

5|$|A <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> greater {{authenticity}} {{began after}} Hammond's orchestrations in the 1970s provided {{a basis for}} staging the work in its original form. This process was further aided by the discovery in the 1990s of Bizet's 1863 conducting score. In this, the orchestral parts were reduced to six staves, but notes and other markings in the manuscript provided additional clues to the original orchestration. These new finds {{became the basis for}} Brad Cohen's critical edition of the score, published by Edition Peters in 2002.|$|E
5|$|After initial {{reports that}} {{warfarin}} could reduce bone mineral density, {{several studies have}} demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis, risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> fracture.|$|E
5|$|Evolution {{also does}} not require that organisms become more complex. Although the history of life shows an {{apparent}} <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> the evolution of biological complexity; {{there is a question}} if this appearance of increased complexity is real, or if it comes from neglecting the fact that the majority of life on Earth has always consisted of prokaryotes. In this view, complexity is not a necessary consequence of evolution, but that specific circumstances of evolution on Earth frequently made greater complexity advantageous and thus naturally selected for. Depending on the situation, organisms' complexity can either increase, decrease, or stay the same, and all three of these trends have been observed in evolution.|$|E

5|$|Mesa Verde is {{best known}} for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock {{overhangs}} along the canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and plastered with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Postan {{argued that}} {{demography}} {{was the principal}} driving force in the medieval English economy. In a distinctly Malthusian fashion, Postan proposed that the English agrarian economy saw little technical development during the period and by the early 14th century was unable to support the growing population, leading to inevitable famines and economic depression as the population came back into balance with land resources. Postan began the <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> stressing continuities between the pre- and post-invasion economies, aided by fresh evidence emerging {{from the use of}} archaeological techniques to understand the medieval economy from the 1950s onwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of perspective {{was part of}} a wider <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> realism in the arts. Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of Leonardo da Vinci, human anatomy. Underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms of aesthetics, with the works of Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists. Other notable artists include Sandro Botticelli, working for the Medici in Florence, Donatello, another Florentine, and Titian in Venice, among others.|$|E

Its floral display and fine foliage have made it a popular garden plant with many horticultural selections available. With the recent <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> smaller gardens, compact dwarf forms of Banksia spinulosa have become popular; the first available, Banksia 'Birthday Candles', has achieved a great deal of commercial success and wide recognition, and has been followed by several others.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} breeding populations in Europe, in Russia and Sweden are stable, and the breeding range in Norway {{has expanded to}} the south, but populations have more than halved in Finland, Poland, Latvia and The Netherlands. Although the small populations in these countries are of limited overall significance, the decline {{is a continuation of}} <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> range contraction that has occurred over the last two centuries. The drop in numbers in Europe has been attributed to drainage, increased fertiliser use, the loss of formerly mown or grazed breeding sites and over-hunting.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} nuclear reactions which generate nucleogenic neon isotopes {{start from}} 24Mg and 25Mg, which produce 21Ne and 22Ne, respectively, after neutron capture and immediate emission of an alpha particle. The neutrons that produce the reactions are mostly produced by secondary spallation reactions from alpha particles, in turn derived from uranium-series decay chains. The net result yields a <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> lower 20Ne/22Ne and higher 21Ne/22Ne ratios observed in uranium-rich rocks such as granites. 21Ne {{may also be}} produced in a nucleogenic reaction, when 20Ne absorbs a neutron from various natural terrestrial neutron sources.|$|E

5|$|The <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> more {{intensive}} farming {{began to be}} partially reversed {{by the end of}} the century as more environmentally friendly practices were encouraged by government and European Union grants. For example, Richard Zawadzki, owner of Balfour Mains (the largest farm on the island), ceased to breed livestock (instead keeping animals bred elsewhere) and grew less grain (some barley is still grown on the farm). Instead, some of the land is now managed under a Habitat Creation Scheme, which aims to encourage natural vegetation, wild flowers and nesting birds by limiting grazing and reducing the use of chemical fertilisers.|$|E
5|$|William De Morgan {{was unwilling}} to {{compromise}} on quality or embrace the <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> mass production, and by this time his work was significantly more expensive than similar works by other designers. Consequently, his ceramics business was becoming increasingly unviable financially. In 1906 his first novel, Joseph Vance, was published and became a great success, prompting DeMorgan to close the ceramics business in 1907 to concentrate on writing. Mary Watts attempted to replicate DeMorgan's tile designs at Watts's pottery in Compton {{but was unable to}} do so, and investigated other tile manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|Burger King's first broiled chicken {{sandwich}} {{was introduced}} in 1990 and was called the BK Broiler. This sandwich was made with lettuce, tomato and a dill ranch sauce served on an oat dusted roll. The product {{came at a time}} of fundamental change in terms of chicken product in the restaurant industry; more than 90% of chicken products sold by the major chains were fried. Shortly after its introduction, the sandwich was selling more than a million units per day, and poaching sales from traditional fried chicken chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Additionally, the sandwiches were part of an industry <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> the diversification of menus with healthier products such as reformulated cooking methods and salads. At the time, the sandwich had 379 calories and 18grams of fat, 10 of which came from the sauce.|$|E

For instance, ENA- 78 <b>trended</b> <b>towards</b> increased expression with increasing tumor grade (Additional file 1 : Fig. S 3) and IL- 3 <b>trended</b> <b>towards</b> decreased expression with increasing Her 2 overexpression (Additional file 1 : Fig. S 4).|$|R
5|$|By 1893 {{there were}} more than 75 collieries within the Rhondda Valleys and {{although}} most were initially owned by a small group of private individuals this trend changed towards the start of the 20th century as companies began buying up the existing collieries. The widespread adoption of limited liability status began a <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> a concentration of ownership, reducing some of the economic risks involved in coalmining: unstable coal prices, inflated acquisitions, geological difficulties, and large scale accidents. The emerging companies were formed by the individuals and families who sank the original collieries; but by the start of the 20th century, they were no more than principal shareholders. These companies included the Davies's Ocean Coal Company, Archibald Hood's Glamorgan Coal Company and David Davis & Son.|$|E
5|$|Henriksen {{was one of}} {{the several}} actors, {{including}} Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton, cast in Aliens who had collaborated with James Cameron on The Terminator. Roz Kaveney, in her analysis of Ash in From Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, draws parallels to Bishop as a representation of the Three Laws of Robotics. Although Ash's programming allows (and encourages) harming humans, Bishop puts human life above all else in accordance with the First Law of Robotics. Bishop was studied by LeiLani Nishime of the University of Texas Press in 2005 as a theoretical dramatization of how humans would deal with the presence of an Other, concerning Ripley's initial apprehension about being near a synthetic after her life-threatening encounter with Ash. According to an article by Anton Karl Kozlovic of the University of Nebraska Omaha, Bishop's altruistic actions (which include rescuing Newt and Ripley) contradict a <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> technophobia in pre-1990 films.|$|E
5|$|On May 27, NOAA {{issued its}} first outlook {{calling for a}} near-normal season with a 70% chance that 10–16 named storms could form, {{including}} 4–8 hurricanes of which 1–4 could reach major hurricane status. NOAA also stated {{that there is a}} 45% chance of a near-normal season, 30% chance of an above-normal season and 25% chance of a below-normal season. Also on May 27, TSR substantially increased their forecast numbers, predicting activity would be about 30% above the average with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes and an ACE near 130. The reason for the increased activity forecast was the increased likelihood of La Niña forming during the season in addition to a <b>trend</b> <b>towards</b> a negative North Atlantic Oscillation, which generally favors a warmer tropical Atlantic. TSR predicted that there is a 57% chance that the 2016 Atlantic season would be above-normal, a 33% chance it would be near-normal, and only a 10% chance it would be below-normal.|$|E
