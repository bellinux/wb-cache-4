50|$|Virtual {{tours are}} {{very popular in}} the real estate industry. Several types of such tours exist, {{including}} simple options such as interactive floor plans, and more sophisticated options such as full-service virtual tours. An interactive floor plan shows photographs of a property {{with the aid of a}} floor plan and arrows to indicate where each photograph was taken. Clicking on arrows shows the user where the camera was and which way the camera was pointing. Full service virtual tours are usually created by a professional photographer who will visit the property being sold, take several photos, and run them <b>through</b> <b>stitching</b> software. Matterport offers 3D camera services to create virtual tours. Full service virtual tours are usually more expensive than interactive floor plans because of the expense of the photographer, higher-end equipment used, such as a digital SLR camera, and specialized software. Real estate virtual tours are typically linked to the listing in the Multiple Listing Service.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for auto-calibrating a compound-type {{omnidirectional}} camera (system). This camera produces spherical panoramic image <b>through</b> <b>stitching</b> some individual images captured by several modular cameras, each of which covers a different field {{of view of the}} full viewing sphere. By auto-calibration we mean that our algorithm works online in a self-calibration manner: it receives as input image point correspondences only, and outputs all the camera parameters. The calibration task consists of lens-distortion-removal, intrinsic-calibration, and relative-orientation. The focus of the paper is an algorithm for automatically removing lens distortion. By exploiting planar projective invariants, our algorithm is capable of estimating centre-of-distortion and distortion parameters efficiently without using any nonlinear iteration...|$|E

The stacking is made of dry fiber fabrics, which are infiltrated in a later process step. The complete stacking is called preform.

Automated preforming can reduce the costs by increasing the output and production rate while minimising waste. Preform profiles with variable outlines and non-extrudable sections are of particular interest for the aviation and automotive industry.

40|$|Diffraction image {{technology}} is an updated technology. It has more potential {{for developing the}} larger aperture and lightweight telescope than the conventional refractive and reflective optics. In order to develop a large aperture diffractive telescope, {{the key is to}} solve the problem of large aperture lens stitching. Different stitching patterns have different effects on the image quality. However, the stitching pattern for diffractive telescope is different from the conventional refractive and reflective telescope. This paper, for the first time, studies the theory of stitching pattern for diffractive telescope. On the basis of theoretical analysis, a long-wavelength infrared diffractive telescope of segmented-lens is designed and for the first time, good results <b>through</b> <b>stitching</b> experiments have been achieved. According to theoretical analysis and experiment verification, the paper gives the best stitching pattern on diffractive telescope.

Developing an automated inspection system eliminates these difficulties. Shown {{in this work}} is a laser scanning microscope (LSM) design for an opto-electronic detection system (OEDS), based upon the concept that intensity differences related to pattern defects {{can be obtained from}} reflections off fused silica samples coated with photoresist (PR) or Aluminum. Development of this system for data collection and processing is discussed. Results show that 2. 1 μm resolution of these defects is obtainable. Preliminary results for larger-array patterns <b>through</b> <b>stitching</b> processes are also shown. The second part of this work uses the concept of phase contrast edge detection. Looking at non-metallized patterns, one can use the property that phase changes induced by a refractive-index sensitive material can be seen with a multi-cell array, rendering the image visible by comparing the respective phases. A variety of defects and samples are shown. Extrapolating results to larger arrays is also discussed. Latent imaging, or imaging without development, is also evaluated. Future work in the areas of system commercialization, sample storage, and other mass-printing techniques are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Eastern Ethiopia hosts a {{substantial}} number of refugees originated from Somalia. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a common practice in the area, despite the campaigns to eliminate it. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 492 respondents sampled from three refugee camps in Somali Regional State, Eastern Ethiopia, to determine the prevalence and associated factors of FGM. Data were collected using pre-tested structured questionnaires. Results Although the intention of the parents to circumcise their daughters was high (84 %), 42. 4 % of 288 ≤ 12 girls were reported being undergone FGM. The prevalence increased with age, and about 52 % and 95 % were circumcised at the age of 7 – 8 and 11 – 12 years, respectively. Almost all operations were performed by traditional circumcisers (81 %) and birth attendants (18 %). Clitoral cutting (64 %) and narrowing of the vaginal opening <b>through</b> <b>stitching</b> (36 %) were the two common forms of FGM reported by the respondents. Participation of the parents in anti-FGM interventions is statistically associated with lower practice and intention of the procedures. Conclusion FGM is widely practised among the Somali refugee community in Eastern Ethiopia, and there was a considerable support for the continuation of the practice particularly among women. The findings indicate a reported shift of FGM from its severe form to milder clitoral cutting. More men than women positively viewed anti-FGM interventions, and fewer men than women had the intention to let their daughters undergo FGM, indicating the need to involve men in anti-FGM activities. </p...|$|E

The quality of the stitching operation has a particular influence on the finite product quality and is determined on side by the quality of knitted pieces, and on the other by insuring the correlation between the technological parameters of the stitching operation and the physico-mechanical characteristics of the knittings that are to be assembled <b>through</b> <b>stitching.</b> Although the product execution processes comprise of manufacturing the elements and distinct subassemblies and their ulterior assembly, they present various difference dictated by the constructive particularities of the machine, as well as fabric characteristics. Because of the multiple interactions between the material, yarn and working parts of the sawing machine, inadequacies in the technological discipline can result in negative effects on both the knitted and stitching thread as well as the machine. A part of these can be fixed by extra time consuming tasks (yarn breaks, stitching ruffling etc.), while other defects appear during the usage of the product cheapening it (stitch tearing by perforating the knitted on the stitching line, pilling effect, dimensional instability etc.). This paper systematically presents, the main defects that may occur during the stitching operation of the products made out of circular knitted, as well as the causes that generate them along with preventive or corrective actions. ...|$|E

30|$|As per the {{stitches}} selected; lock-stitch 301 and chain-stitch 401, recommended thread {{types of}} poly/poly core-spun threads (with polyester continuous filament core and polyester staple wrap) were used. Yarn {{count of the}} thread was taken instead of the thread ticket number value to minimize the approximation errors occurring in ticket number calculations. Fabric thickness was measured following the test standard of BS 2544, methods for determination of thickness of textile materials (British standards institution 1987). Yarn counts of threads were measured using ASTM D 1907, standard method of test for yarn number by the skein method (ASTM International 1997). Thread consumption and average thread tension were measured using MLT Wesco tension and length meter with the accuracy up to 1  mm and 0.1 cN respectively.

Actual thread lengths were measured using crimp tester adhering to the procedures in the test standard ASTM D 3883, standard test method for yarn crimp and yarn take-up in woven fabrics (ASTM International 2012).
