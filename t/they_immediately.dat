5|$|Like most spiders, Trogloraptor possess venom glands. However, {{the venom}} {{is not known}} to be harmful to humans. The spiders {{themselves}} are very shy and unaggressive. <b>They</b> <b>immediately</b> flee illumination.|$|E
5|$|The dislike was mutual. After Domitian's assassination, the {{senators}} of Rome {{rushed to the}} Senate house, where <b>they</b> <b>immediately</b> passed a motion condemning his memory to oblivion. Under the rulers of the Nervan-Antonian dynasty, senatorial authors published histories that elaborated on the view of Domitian as a tyrant.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} ended, while Stark's militiamen were busy disarming the prisoners and looting their supplies, Breymann arrived with his {{reinforce}}ments. Seeing the Americans in disarray, <b>they</b> <b>immediately</b> pressed their attack. After hastily regrouping, Stark's forces {{tried to hold}} their ground against the new German onslaught, but began to fall back. Before their lines collapsed, Warner's men {{arrived on the scene}} to reinforce Stark's troops. Pitched battle continued until dark, when both sides disengaged. Breymann began a hasty retreat; he had lost one quarter of his force and all of his artillery pieces.|$|E

5|$|At 11:00 Swannell's company {{arrived at}} the foot of Baby 700, joining the seventy {{survivors}} of Robertson's and Lalor's companies. <b>They</b> <b>immediately</b> charged and chased the Turks back over the summit of Baby 700, then stopped and dug in. The two 2nd Battalion companies arrived alongside them, but all the companies had taken casualties, among the dead being Swannell and Robertson.|$|E
5|$|At {{the airport}} bar, Brian gets very drunk and, when Stewie comes to {{retrieve}} him, their plane tickets are stolen. They {{stop at a}} rundown motel, where Stewie tries calling home, but fails because he believes his phone number is 867-5309. The next day, they have to escape and hotwire a car because their credit card was rejected. To get home, Stewie and Brian masquerade as crop dusters to steal a plane, which <b>they</b> <b>immediately</b> destroy.|$|E
5|$|The {{notes were}} handed to two {{horsemen}} who were standing by. The Manchester and Salford Yeomanry were stationed {{just a short}} distance away in Portland Street, and so received their note first. <b>They</b> <b>immediately</b> drew their swords and galloped towards St Peter's Field. One trooper, in a frantic attempt to catch up, knocked down a woman in Cooper Street, causing the death of her son when he was thrown from her arms; two-year-old William Fildes was the first casualty of Peterloo.|$|E

5|$|After CoreFire, the world's {{greatest}} superhero, goes missing, {{the former}} members of The Champions re-unite to investigate his disappearance, bringing in two new replacement heroines, Lily and Fatale. <b>They</b> <b>immediately</b> suspect CoreFire's nemesis, Dr. Impossible, was involved, {{even though he has}} been incarcerated in a maximum security prison since his defeat by Damsel during his twelfth world domination attempt. An interrogation by two novice heroes about CoreFire's disappearance gives Dr. Impossible the chance to escape and initiate a new attempt at world domination. The New Champions search for Impossible, convinced he is responsible for CoreFire's demise, while he gathers the materials needed to advance his plan. This is intercut with flashbacks to earlier times and his origin, as well as reflections on other paths he could have taken in life.|$|E
5|$|As 9 Staffel {{crossed the}} coast they were fired at by Royal Navy patrol boats. The machine gun fire was ineffective. However, the Royal Observer Corps Post K3, {{situated}} {{on top of}} Beachy Head, spotted the Dorniers. <b>They</b> <b>immediately</b> telephoned a warning to Observer Group Headquarters at Horsham and fighter sector stations in the area, including RAF Kenley. Wing Commander Thomas Prickman, the station commander at Kenley, noticed the low-flying Dornier plot appear on his situation map. They appeared to be heading away towards the west, and was unsure of their target. His controllers were organising Nos. 64 and 615 Squadrons to meet the high-altitude raid. Roth headed past Lewes until {{he picked up the}} Brighton–London rail line. He then turned north-west.|$|E
5|$|Darwaza and Hafiz Kanaan—another leading al-Fatat {{member from}} Nablus—lobbied Arab groups in Jerusalem to {{advocate}} Syro-Palestinian unity {{before the arrival}} of the King-Crane Commission on 10 June 1919. They first met with Haj Amin al-Husseini and Kamil al-Husayni of al-Nadi al-Arabi party and <b>they</b> <b>immediately</b> expressed their support. They also suggested that Darwaza meet Raghib al-Nashashibi, Hussam ad-Din Jarallah, and Aref al-Dajani, supporters of independence. Darwaza convinced Nashashibi to gather some of the Older Politicians of Jerusalem to a meeting at his house. When it was made clear that Musa al-Husayni, a leader of the Older Politicians, was now in favor of unity, all of the other Older Politicians followed suit. When the commission arrived in Jaffa, it concluded on 27 June that it was in favor of Syro-Palestinian unity under a British Mandate.|$|E

5|$|Democrats in the General Assembly were outraged. When the 1930 {{legislative}} session convened, <b>they</b> <b>immediately</b> {{passed a bill}} that stripped Sampson of his power to appoint a highway commissioner, giving it to a three-person commission composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. The Republican Sampson would be outnumbered and outvoted in this group. Confident that the Democrats would not lose another gubernatorial election, Democratic legislators stipulated in the bill that the appointment power {{would return to the}} governor in 1931, the end of Sampson's term. The law passed the House by a vote of 53—42 and the Senate by a vote of 22—15. Sampson vetoed the bill, but the veto was overridden, and Johnson was returned to his former position.|$|E
5|$|E-3 Sentry {{aircraft}} {{were among}} the first to deploy during Operation Desert Shield, where <b>they</b> <b>immediately</b> established as an around-the-clock radar screen to defend against Iraqi forces. During Operation Desert Storm, E-3s flew 379 missions and logged 5,052 hours of on-station time. The data collection capability of the E-3 radar and computer subsystems allowed an entire air war to be recorded for the first time in history. In addition to providing senior leadership with time-critical information on the actions of enemy forces, E-3 controllers assisted in 38 of the 41 air-to-air kills recorded during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Temporarily {{transferred}} to Ziguinchor, the Carabane mission closed in 1888. Missionaries returned in 1890 and, although <b>they</b> <b>immediately</b> expanded the church building, {{it was still}} not {{large enough to accommodate}} all those who wished to attend. Thanks to subsidies by the bishop, Magloire-Désiré Barthet, and to donations by the parishioners, a new church was built and inaugurated on the Catholic feast day of Saint Anne in 1897. The mission also obtained two adjacent properties, lot #73 on the cadastral map. By the following year, the Christian community had performed 1,100 baptisms, as well as many catechumen.|$|E

5|$|The North Vietnamese {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} the sensors was swift. If PAVN troops could detect the general location of a sensor, <b>they</b> <b>immediately</b> began to search out others and destroy them. Another response was to simply avoid them. The final evolution of anti-sensor measures was to attempt to deceive them. The chief protection of the sensors proved to be the dense foliage that covered the majority of the logistical system, turning the enemy's chief protection against him. Doubtless, PAVN troops negated the effects of many sensors, but so many of them were sown over such {{a long period of time}} that the majority survived.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders {{decided to}} attack Damascus from the west, where {{orchards}} would {{provide them with}} a constant food supply. Having arrived outside the walls of the city, <b>they</b> <b>immediately</b> put it to siege, using wood from the orchards. On 27 July, the crusaders decided to move to the plain on {{the eastern side of the}} city, which was less heavily fortified but had much less food and water. Nur ad-Din Zangi arrived with Muslim reinforcements and cut off the crusaders' route to their previous position. The local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege, and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city. The entire crusader army retreated back to Jerusalem by 28 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} team must {{line up in}} a legal formation {{before they}} can snap the ball. An offensive formation is considered illegal if {{there are more than}} four players in the backfield or fewer than five players numbered 50–79 on the offensive line. Players can temporarily line up in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as <b>they</b> <b>immediately</b> report the change to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change. Neither team's players, {{with the exception of the}} snapper, are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped. Interior offensive linemen are not allowed to move until the snap of the ball.|$|E

5|$|The stolen {{capuchin}} monkey named Oscar {{is played}} by live animal actor Katie, best known for playing Marcel, Ross Geller's pet monkey, on the sitcom Friends. Near {{the time of the}} episode's airing, she had also appeared in Bruce Almighty and an episode of 30 Rock. When the episode's editor first received one take of the scene in which Veronica and Mac sarcastically dance in response to accusations of doing a poor job on a school project, the editor called the writing staff into the editing room; they proceeded to view the scene fifteen times because of its humorous nature. <b>They</b> <b>immediately</b> included the take in the final cut of the episode.|$|E
5|$|Usually, when {{a gunman}} {{was hired by}} a town as town marshal, they {{received}} {{the full support of}} the townspeople until order was restored, at which point the town would tactfully indicate {{it was time for a}} change to a less dangerous lawman who relied more on respect than fear to enforce the law. A good example was the 1882 decision by the El Paso, Texas, town council to dismiss Town Marshal Dallas Stoudenmire. He entered the council hall and dared the councilors to try to take his guns or his job, at which point <b>they</b> <b>immediately</b> changed their mind, saying he could keep his job. He resigned on his own a couple of days later.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a formula that compared {{the cost of an}} ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor of the offense - they could build more ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always the case that the offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed sole control of the ABM efforts, <b>they</b> <b>immediately</b> submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might be correct.|$|E
