Although {{it seems to}} be necessary priori knowledge to understand the bond stress–slip relationships of a strand in concrete at elevated temperature, no research has been reported in the literature. Absent such knowledge, inconsistent bonding time has been assumed for the purpose of estimating <b>thermal</b> prestress <b>loss</b> in the literature. Barr et al. (2005) estimated the <b>thermal</b> prestress <b>loss</b> of 3 – 7 % of the initial prestress if bonding occurred within the range of 6 – 10  h after casting. Roller et al.

40|$|A thermal {{analysis}} {{of the performance of}} a solar flat-plate collector operating in nonboiling, boiling, and superheated regimes is presented.

40|$|Statutory {{requirements}} to reduce CO 2 from tail pipes and {{strong interest in}} global environmental protection drove the main goal of modern HSDI diesel engines towards low fuel consumption. Two of the main strands of the criteria for low fuel consumption of modern diesel engine development are down-sizing and down-speeding. Down-sizing {{is well known for}} movement of the engine operation area in the direction of higher-loads, and thus better thermal efficiency is available. But this may cause degraded vehicle dynamic performance because of reduced back up torque as well as increased NOx. The down-speeding method aims to move engine operation area to higher load and lower engine speed. By this method degraded vehicle dynamic performance can be minimized with tangible fuel economy benefits. This study analyzed the characteristics of down-speeding relating to engine operation conditions and the fuel economy effect broken down by sector during the NEDC.
