5|$|During {{his early}} career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and {{dysfunctional}} the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery {{had broken down}} {{under the weight of}} imperialism, the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals. Between his crossing of the Rubicon river in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals. First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the empire. Second, he wanted to create a strong central government in Rome. And finally, he wanted <b>to</b> <b>knit</b> together the entire empire into a single cohesive unit.|$|E
5|$|Plante {{was born}} on a farm near Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel, in Mauricie, Quebec, the first of 11 {{children}} born to Palma and Xavier Plante. The family moved to Shawinigan Falls, where his father worked {{in one of the}} local factories. In 1932, Plante began to play hockey, skateless and with a tennis ball, using a goaltender's hockey stick his father had carved from a tree root. When he was five years old, Plante fell off a ladder and broke his hand. The fracture failed to heal properly and affected his playing style during his early hockey career; he underwent successful corrective surgery as an adult. Plante suffered from asthma starting in early childhood. This prevented him from skating for extended periods so he gravitated to playing goaltender. As his playing progressed, Jacques received his first regulation goaltender's stick for Christmas of 1936. His father made Plante's first pads by stuffing potato sacks and reinforcing them with wooden panels. As a child, Plante played hockey outdoors in the bitterly cold Quebec winters. His mother taught him how <b>to</b> <b>knit</b> his own tuques to protect him from the cold. Plante continued knitting and embroidering throughout his life and wore his hand-knitted tuques while playing and practicing until entering the National Hockey League (NHL).|$|E

5000|$|Earlier pieces {{having a}} {{knitted or crocheted}} {{appearance}} {{have been shown to}} be made with other techniques, such as Nålebinding, a technique of making fabric by creating multiple loops with a single needle and thread, much like sewing. Some artifacts have a structure so similar <b>to</b> <b>knitting,</b> for example, 3rd-5th century CE Romano-Egyptian toe-socks, that it is thought the [...] "Coptic stitch" [...] of nalbinding is the forerunner <b>to</b> <b>knitting.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{pursuit of}} state-controlled {{economic}} policies by Atatürk and İsmet İnönü {{was guided by}} a national vision: they wanted <b>to</b> <b>knit</b> the country together, eliminate foreign control of the economy, and improve communications.

50|$|Technological {{advances}} such as computerized {{knitting machines}} saw new designs and approaches <b>to</b> <b>knitting.</b> Some artists began <b>to</b> see <b>knitting</b> {{as a legitimate}} art form rather than a craft or cottage industry, and more attention {{was placed on the}} design possibilities of knitting from an artistic perspective rather than just fashionable or practical approaches.|$|R
50|$|The Giants wore flannels until midseason, going <b>to</b> double <b>knits</b> at home only; the flannels {{would not}} be phased out for the road uniforms for 1973. The Red Sox {{switched}} <b>to</b> double <b>knits</b> midway through 1972. Only the Royals, Expos and Yankees wore flannels full-time during the 1972 season, and all three converted <b>to</b> double <b>knits</b> for 1973.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to his military work, Lord Kitchener contributed to efforts on the home front. The knitted sock patterns of the day used a seam up the toe that could rub uncomfortably against the toes. Kitchener encouraged British and American women <b>to</b> <b>knit</b> for the war effort, and contributed a sock pattern featuring a new technique for a seamless join of the toe, still known as the Kitchener stitch.|$|E

25|$|The {{national}} government strongly supported railway construction for political goals. First, it wanted <b>to</b> <b>knit</b> the far-flung provinces together. Second, {{it wanted to}} maximize trade within Canada and minimize trade with the United States to avoid becoming an economic satellite. The Grand Trunk Railway of Canada linked Toronto and Montreal in 1853. Lines to Portland in Maine (which was ice-free), Michigan and Chicago, were subsequently opened. By 1870 it was the longest railway in the world.|$|E

25|$|The first Canadian railway, the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad, {{was opened}} in 1836 outside of Montreal, a {{seasonal}} portage railway to connect river traffic. It {{was followed by}} the Albion Railway in Stellarton, Nova Scotia in 1840, a collier railway connecting coal mines to a seaport. In Canada, the national government strongly supported railway construction for political goals. First it wanted <b>to</b> <b>knit</b> the far-flung provinces together and second, it wanted to maximize trade inside Canada and minimize trade with the United States, to avoid becoming an economic satellite. The Grand Trunk Railway of Canada linked Toronto and Montreal in 1853, then opened a line to Portland, Maine (which was ice-free) and lines to Michigan and Chicago. By 1870 it was the longest railway in the world. The Intercolonial line, finished in 1876, linked the Maritimes to Quebec and Ontario, tying them to the new Confederation.|$|E
25|$|Around 100BC, the Adena {{evolved into}} the Hopewell people, who were named for the farm owned by Captain M. C. Hopewell, where {{evidence}} of their unique culture was discovered. Like the Adena, the Hopewell people participated in a mound-building culture. Their complex, large and technologically sophisticated earthworks {{can be found in}} modern-day Marietta, Newark, and Circleville. They were also a powerful trading society, managing <b>to</b> <b>knit</b> together a network that passed goods throughout a third of the continent. The Hopewell, however, disappeared from the Ohio Valley in about 600AD. Little is known about the people who replaced them, although many Siouan-speaking peoples from the Plains & East Coast claim them as ancestors & say they lived throughout the Ohio region until approx. the 13th century. It is possible that the rise of the Mississippian Culture was the downfall of the Hopewell, as they began to rise to prominence on the Mississippi River around {{the same time that the}} Hopewell Culture died out.|$|E
500|$|Mathematical objects {{including}} the Lorenz manifold and the hyperbolic plane have been crafted using fiber arts including crochet. The American weaver Ada Dietz wrote a 1949 monograph Algebraic Expressions in Handwoven Textiles, defining weaving patterns {{based on the}} expansion of multivariate polynomials. The mathematician J. C. P. Miller used the Rule 90 cellular automaton to design tapestries depicting both trees and abstract patterns of triangles. The [...] "mathekniticians" [...] Pat Ashforth and Steve Plummer use knitted versions of mathematical objects such as hexaflexagons in their teaching, though their Menger sponge proved too troublesome <b>to</b> <b>knit</b> and was made of plastic canvas instead.

500|$|Gregorio Luperón met Betances in Saint Thomas, {{and offered}} to assist the Puerto Rican revolution, in {{exchange}} for help to overthrow Báez once the right circumstances were met. As a consequence, Betances organized revolutionary cells in Puerto Rico from exile, which would be led by leaders such as Manuel Rojas and Mathias Brugman. Betances instructed Mariana Bracetti <b>to</b> <b>knit</b> a flag for the revolution using the colors and basic design {{similar to that of}} the Dominican Republic (which in turn was almost identical to a French military standard). Betances was also supposed to send reinforcements to the Puerto Rican rebels through the use of a ship purchased by Puerto Rican and Dominican revolutionaries, [...] "El Telégrafo" [...] (which was to be shared by both), but the ship was confiscated soon after arrival by the government of the then Danish (later United States) Virgin Islands.|$|E
500|$|Upon his {{recuperation}} {{and return}} to the army, Steuart was assigned by Gen. Robert E. Lee to command the Third Brigade, a force of around 2,200 men, in Major General Edward [...] "Allegheny" [...] Johnson's division, in the Army of Northern Virginia. The brigade's former commander, Brigadier General Raleigh Colston, had been relieved of his command by Lee, who was disappointed by his performance at the Battle of Chancellorsville. The brigade consisted of the following regiments: the 2nd Maryland (successor to the disbanded 1st Maryland), the 1st and 3rd North Carolina, and the 10th, 23rd, and 37th Virginia. Rivalries between the various state regiments had been a recurring problem in the brigade and Lee hoped that Steuart, as an [...] "old army" [...] hand, would be able <b>to</b> <b>knit</b> them together effectively. In addition, by this stage in the war Lee was desperately short of experienced senior commanders. However, Steuart had only been in command for a month when the Gettysburg Campaign got under way.|$|E
500|$|When Carter goes {{undercover}} in the episode, {{she wears}} a dress inspired by the evening dresses of the 1930s and 40s, which the script described as a [...] "Veronica Lake look". Ottobre-Melton noted that [...] "We got to make Peggy into the classic femme fatale". For the character of Colleen O'Brien, series costume designer Giovanna Ottobre-Melton saw her as [...] "a hard working girl making just enough to get by. The war term 'Mend and Make Do' really applies to her. She has a few nice pieces in her closet that she scrimped and saved to buy. My guess is {{she knows how to}} unravel an old tired sweater <b>to</b> <b>knit</b> herself a new one." [...] The man in the green suit [...] "wore a suit that was a tricky balance," [...] explained Ottobre-Melton. [...] "The goal was to find a green that wasn't over the top, but still made a powerful statement. The suit I designed was inspired by a 1940s green double breasted suit I had located." ...|$|E

50|$|Another {{common mistake}} {{is to think}} of nålbinding as {{superior}} <b>to</b> <b>knitting,</b> because it requires more skill. It {{is very easy to}} learn and master; given proper instruction, even the more complex techniques are quite possible to learn with comparably little prior knowledge (though some is recommended). It can create different textiles, thin and flexible ones as well as thick and comparably stiff ones, depending on which technique is used. It is equally false <b>to</b> say <b>knitting</b> is superior <b>to</b> nålbinding. They are different; each has advantages and disadvantages.|$|R
500|$|Despite the success, Hutchinson {{was voted}} {{out of the}} {{assembly}} in 1749. [...] He was, however, immediately appointed to the Governor's Council. In 1749 he headed a commission to arrange a treaty with the Indians in the District of Maine, which was then part of Massachusetts, and he served on boundary commissions to settle disputes with Connecticut and Rhode Island. In 1752 he was appointed judge of probate and a justice of the Common Pleas. Following {{the outbreak of the}} French and Indian War in 1754, he was a delegate to the Albany Convention. [...] In that meeting he took a leading part in the discussions, working with Benjamin Franklin to draft a plan for colonial union. [...] Hutchinson agreed with Franklin that the present disunity endangered the British colonies, and that decisive action must be taken <b>to</b> <b>knit</b> the too-often-competing colonies into a coherent whole. Most important, the report drafted by Hutchinson concluded that the colonies must be encouraged to establish [...] "a Union of His Majesty's several governments on the continent, that so their councils, treasure, and strength may be employed in due proportion against their common enemy".|$|E
500|$|In September 1939, Britain {{entered the}} Second World War, which lasted until 1945. During the war, many of London's {{children}} were evacuated {{to avoid the}} frequent aerial bombing. The suggestion by senior politician Lord Hailsham that the two princesses should be evacuated to Canada was rejected by Elizabeth's mother, who declared, [...] "The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave." [...] Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret stayed at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House, Norfolk. From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle, where they lived {{for most of the}} next five years. At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn <b>to</b> <b>knit</b> into military garments. In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities. She stated: [...] "We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well." ...|$|E
500|$|Trimmer also {{founded and}} oversaw charity schools in her neighborhood. She {{directed}} promising students from her Sunday schools, which met {{only once a}} week, to these charity schools, which met several times a week. As she wrote in her journal, these schools seemed to her to [...] "afford a happy prospect of rescuing many poor children from vice and profligacy". While the Sunday schools were funded by subscription, that is, donations from people within the parish, the charity schools were largely funded by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK), which had funded the first charity schools around a century earlier. Trimmer criticized the rote learning {{that went on in}} traditional charity schools and tried to institute a more dynamic catechetical method in her own schools that would stimulate students to ask questions. She wrote in her journal, [...] "my earnest desire is to compose a course of teaching for Charity Schools, by which the children may learn in reality, and not by rote, the principles of the Christian Religion, as taught in the Scriptures". Trimmer also established schools of industry to which she directed her less promising pupils. These schools would teach girls, for example, how <b>to</b> <b>knit</b> and spin. Initially, Trimmer believed that the schools would turn a profit since the girls would spin and knit all day long; however, the girls were unskilled and turned out poor products that could not be sold. Trimmer viewed this project as a failure.|$|E
