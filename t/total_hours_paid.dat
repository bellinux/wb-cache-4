40|$|Objectives. We {{describe}} how paid and unpaid home care hours received by older unmarried Americans change {{in response to}} disability dynamics. We test whether responses to disability declines and improvements are symmetric; that is, we test whether reductions in care hours that are due to disability improvements are of similar magnitude to increases in care hours that are due to disability declines. Methods. Using a national sample of older unmarried Americans, we examine changes in <b>total</b> <b>hours,</b> <b>paid</b> hours, and unpaid hours of care in response to declines and improvements in personal care (activities of daily living, or ADLs) and routine care (instrumental ADLs, or IADLs) disability. We model changes in the total hours of care received {{in the past month}} and jointly model changes in unpaid and paid hours, using Tobit models. Results. Changes in the total hours of care received respond to both increases and decreases in the count of ADL limitations and appear close to symmetric. In contrast, responses to IADL disability dynamics appear to be far less symmetric: Although increases in the count of IADL limitations are met with substantial increases in the total hours of care, decreases are not met with correspondingly large declines in care. The same general pattern is found for unpaid and paid care, and for Medicaid-funded home care. Discussion. Disability and care are not static constructs in old age. Older unmarried persons experience worsening, stabilizing, and recovery of function, and their care hours change accordingly. Evaluations of home care programs must b...|$|E
40|$|We study {{changes in}} time and money {{available}} to families with children from 1971 to 2006. Increases in incomes {{at the top of}} the Canadian income distribution since the mid- 1990 s have taken place without any significant increases in <b>total</b> family <b>hours</b> of <b>paid</b> work. On the other hand, for families in the middle of the income distribution, family income has stagnated, despite the fact that parents jointly supply significantly higher <b>hours</b> of <b>paid</b> work. If both time and money are valuable resources for the production of well-being for family members, these findings suggest that inequality in well-being has increased even more than inequality of income. ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{analyses}} the 1997 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Time Use Survey (TUS) {{in order}} to investigate {{the ways in which}} Australians manage to balance the competing demands of work and family. It uses four measures, three relating to the ‘objective’ time pressure of the <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> worked (<b>paid</b> work, unpaid work and child care), and one measure of ‘subjective’ time pressure (feelings of being rushed or pressed for time). These measures are applied to six household types classified according to the arrangements each has made in relation to employment and child are: male-breadwinner family, one-and-a-half-earner family, (standard full-time) dual-career family (woman working standard full-time hours), (long hours full-time) dual-career family (woman working more than 49 hours a week), family in which the man does not work full-time, and sole mother family. The report investigates the differences between these household types, between men and women as individuals within households, and between sole mothers and married mothers. It also investigates the ways in which two key work-family policy measures – non-parental childcare and part-time work – currently affect work-family balance within Australian households...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the impact of}} the introduction of the UK minimum wage on the working hours of low-wage employees using difference-in-differences estimators. The estimates using the employer-based New Earnings Surveys indicate that the introduction of the minimum wage reduced the basic hours of low-wage workers by between 1 and 2 hours per week. The effects on <b>total</b> <b>paid</b> <b>hours</b> are similar (indicating negligible effects on paid overtime) and lagged effects dominate the smaller and less significant initial effects within this. Estimates using the employee-based Labour Force Surveys are typically less significant. minimum wages; working hours; labour demand; difference-in-differences estimator...|$|R
40|$|The {{movement}} of hours worked over {{the business cycle}} is an important input into the estimation of many key parameters in macroeconomics. Unfortunately, the available data on hours do not correspond precisely to the concept required for accurate inference. We study one source of mismeasurement [...] that {{the most commonly used}} source data measure <b>hours</b> <b>paid</b> instead of <b>hours</b> worked [...] focusing our attention on salaried workers, a group for whom the gap between <b>hours</b> <b>paid</b> and <b>hours</b> worked is likely particularly large. We show that the measurement gap varies significantly and positively with changes in labor demand. As a result, we estimate that the standard deviations of the workweek and of <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> worked are 25 and 6 percent larger, respectively, than standard measures of hours suggest. We also find that this measurement gap is an unlikely source of the acceleration in published measures of productivity since 2000. Labor productivity; Hours of labor...|$|R

40|$|To {{what extent}} do workers work more hours than they are paid for? The {{relationship}} between hours worked and <b>hours</b> <b>paid,</b> and {{the conditions under which}} employers can demand more hours “off the clock,” is not well understood. The answer to this question impacts worker welfare, as well as wage and hour regulation. In addition, work off the clock has important implications for the measurement and cyclical movement of productivity and wages. In this paper, I construct a unique administrative dataset of <b>hours</b> <b>paid</b> by employers linked to a survey of workers on their reported hours worked to measure work off the clock. Using cross-sectional variation in local labor markets, I find only a small cyclical component to work off the clock. The results point to labor hoarding rather than efficiency wage theory, indicating work off the clock cannot explain the counter-cyclical movement of productivity. I find workers employed by small firms, and in industries with a high rate of wage and hour violations are associated with larger differences in hours worked than <b>hours</b> <b>paid.</b> These findings suggest the importance of tracking hours of work for enforcement of labor regulations. ...|$|R

40|$|The Earnings, Hours and Employment Costs Survey (EHECS) captures {{information}} each quarter on <b>total</b> earnings, <b>paid</b> <b>hours</b> {{and level}} of employment from a large representative sample of employers. Responses received typically cover more than 70 % of all employees in the state. The main purpose of the survey is to gauge trends in the average level of earnings and hours worked over time across all sectors of the economy. However {{the presence of the}} same employers in the sample over time creates a valuable opportunity to undertake longitudinal analysis of the manner in which employers change their wage bill over time. A previously published study from EHECS comparing quarter 3 2008 with quarter 3 2009 showed that for the matched employers, covering over half of all employees in the state, nearly two thirds of those employers had cut their wage bill by more than 2 percent over the year with the primary method of reduction being a reduction in numbers employed, followed by reductions in hours worked and reductions in hourly rates of pay. The level and type of change differed significantly across sectors.

25|$|The rising {{standard}} of living under socialism led to a steady decrease in the workday {{and an increase in}} leisure.

30|$|We finally {{evaluate}} the potential {{change in the}} <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> worked between groups, {{before and after the}} AUH. In this case, the analysis is restricted to those women who remain employed throughout the four quarters of each follow-up period. We estimate the treatment effect using the two-step Heckman selection model which allows us to correct the selection bias arising from female labor participation. This will be represented by the probability of women being employed during the whole monitoring period. To measure labor intensity, we calculate the change in the <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> worked per week normalized by the intertemporal average labor intensity of each woman. To carry out this methodology, we assume that there are certain women’s characteristics that affect both labor participation and intensity (age, education, region) while others are specific explanatory factors of the <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> worked or the probability of being employed.|$|R
