2500|$|The {{decline of}} the {{passenger}} service started in 1956 {{when the number of}} trains dropped to three daily return runs, one of which was provided by a pair of <b>twinset</b> railcars. [...] On 27 March 1957, the midday train was cancelled. [...] A decade later, locomotive-hauled carriage trains replaced the railcars on 3 July 1967, at which time the number of services dropped further to just one daily return train.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, at the {{suggestion}} of Hamilton City Council, an 88-seater was refurbished for a new fast service between Hamilton and Auckland aimed at business customers, and it started on Monday, 8 April 1968. [...] It was fitted with carpet and re-upholstered fabric-covered seats, and was painted in a new two-tone blue colour scheme that prompted the nickname Blue Streak. The seating was reduced to 84 to accommodate a servery area from which light meals and assorted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks could be purchased. This was notable as {{the first time that a}} regularly scheduled passenger train service in New Zealand had reinstated on board catering since dining cars had been withdrawn across the network as a World War 1 economy measure. This initial service was unsuccessful, with patronage well below the levels needed to be profitable. The service might have been successful if run the other way round from Hamilton to Auckland in the morning but in 1968 the Wellington-Auckland Limited and Express were still timetabled to cater for the early morning commuter market from Hamilton and Huntly or in the other direction from Palmerston North and Levin and those leaving Auckland or Wellington in the evening for the Waikato or Manawatu or Horewhenua, while the NZR long term desire to maintain the New Plymouth- Auckland <b>twinset</b> service was much more because it brought people into Auckland in the morning, leaving Taurmaranu at 6.30 am and Hamilton at 9.30am and returned in the afternoon rather than for its night social and paper service through the King Country which Government cabinets saw as essential. Therefore, the Hamilton commuter market was served by many other services at lower second class fare cost in 1968 and the Blue Streak experiment was simply in the wrong direction at the wrong time.|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately for NZR, the 1950s was {{a period}} of {{increased}} prosperity and saw massive increases in the numbers of private motorcars, along with improvements to roading such as tarsealing the main highways, and construction of the Auckland Harbour Bridge. However while the delay in introducing the railcars on the Rotorua route(1959) and the difficult geography of the Northland and Bay of Plenty service meant poor patronage, the Railcars [...] stabalised Railways long distance rail patronage at 3 million annually from 1959-1964. But by the mid 1960s the Fiats were dated and patronage fell. However at the time the Railways still believed there was potential for intercity rail services, there were strong licensing restrictions on bus competition and while 737 jets entered New Zealand service in 1967, low airfares and second hand Japanese car imports did not occur until deregulation in the mid 1980s and potential for rail passenger profits remained [...] and NZR therefore requested the calling of tenders for new engines and crankshafts for all 35 twinsets plus spares for 1.05 million pounds in July 1966. In January 1967 the Cabinet approved only replacement crankshafts to continue the twin sets for 5 years on the Waiarapa, Wellington- Napier-Gisborne and Auckland-New Plymouth routes [...] and to conduct trials of fast upgraded railcar service between Auckland and Hamilton and Wellington and Palmerston North. At the time it was intended to scrap all <b>twinset</b> operation in the South Island using Vulcans on the Picton and West Coast services. In 1967-68 all railcar services from Auckland were cut except for the service to New Plymouth. [...] This was cut back to operate between New Plymouth and Taumarunui in the early 1970s, with passengers making connections to North Island Main Trunk trains. [...] All cancelled trains were replaced by New Zealand Railways Road Services buses.|$|E

This type of diving is the province of <b>twinsets,</b> rebreathers or even more complex assemblages. The diver however still needs to consider bailout - an interruption of the planned dive by breathing gas problems that requires a safe exit to the surface. In certain technical diving equipment configurations the use of larger pony bottles can again come to the fore, particular if the diving is not excessively deep and decompression requirements are modest. An example {{can be in the}} case of rebreathers, where the diluent gas supply is also used as a bailout bottle for rebreather failure. The capacity of the diluent bottle is very often insufficient for this bailout purpose, and an appropriate larger sized pony can serve as a [...] "backup to the bailout".|$|R

By unravelling its ups and downs, in different places and eras, this book starts to shed a light {{on the origins of}} our current perspective on knitwear. Due to knitwear's associations with hobby culture, femininity and crafts, it is too often overlooked that it can also be something highly fashionable, experimental and a daring choice for fashion designers. Knitwear's contemporary comeback is in fact a vogue for something that never really disappeared.

5000|$|The Railways Department was keen {{to expand}} the use of railcars for {{passenger}} services following successful trials of the vehicles on select routes in the 1930s and 1940s. Accordingly, first Standard-class and later <b>twinset</b> railcars replaced the Napier Express passenger trains through Woodville from 1954. A locomotive-hauled passenger service was re-introduced from 1972, which was at first known as the Endeavour, and later the Bay Express from 1989.

His unwelcome re-appearance in Drusilla's life following release from a seven-year prison sentence led both Rose, who he tried to blackmail, and Halifax, who began to emit some tender feelings for his female colleague, to take stock of their relationship with her, but then actively to stand by her. In the final episode of the series, Drusilla told Rose that she had [...] "no private life", although it became reasonably clear that she reciprocated Halifax's apparent fondness for her.|$|E
