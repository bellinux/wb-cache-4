After the ceremony Max and O.B. leave everyone to enjoy the party while they slip away with Tom. When they are alone Max gives O.B. an engraved watch to say thanks for being his best man and his best mate, but when Niall drives away at speed he doesn't see Tom {{in the way of}} the car and Max jumps out in front of him to grab Tom, Niall did not put the brakes and carried on and crashed in to a wall after running over Max. O.B. rushed to Max's side and held him, soon after he died in O.B.'s arms and Steph arrived too late to say goodbye. Steph was overwhelmed with grief, and refused to leave her flat she shared with Max or wouldn't <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> wedding dress, until a visit from the priest helps her to face up to her responsibilities for Tom. Later at Max's will reading, Steph and Tom were left Max's entire estate.|$|E

25|$|Crandon {{performed}} {{many of her}} séances in the nude, and {{was reported}} to throw herself onto the laps of her male sitters. She was also described as an alcoholic. During séances, Eric Dingwall told Crandon to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> clothes {{and sit in the}} nude. Crandon would also sometimes sprinkle luminous powder on her breasts and because of such activities William McDougall and other psychical researchers criticized Dingwall for having improper relations with Crandon.|$|E
500|$|On Sunday, 24 August 2008, {{film maker}} Nancy Kates {{set off a}} metal {{detector}} during security screening. She objected when the agent attempted to pat-down her breasts. She said she told the agent, [...] "'You can't treat me as a criminal for wearing a bra." [...] A TSA supervisor {{told her she had}} to either submit to the pat-down search in a private room or not fly. Kates offered to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> bra, which the TSA accepted. She went to the restroom, removed her bra, and walked through the airport and security screening braless.

500|$|In 1998, Marshall rejoined Jarrett in the WWF. At the {{beginning}} of her WWF career, known simply as Debra, she played the part of a shrewd businesswoman, wearing business suits. She also played the part of Jarrett's girlfriend. In late 1998, Jarrett began a feud with Goldust that culminated in December at [...] in a [...] "Striptease match". During the match, Debra hit Goldust over the head with Jarrett's trademark guitar, enabling Jarrett to win. WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels, however, disqualified Jarrett, and Debra had to strip due to the match's stipulations. As she stripped, The Blue Blazer and Jarrett covered her up. Debra, however, began utilizing a new strategy during matches, distracting Jarrett's opponents by unbuttoning her blouse. She would willingly <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> blouse to show the crowd her [...] "puppies", a nickname originally bestowed upon her chest by wrestler Road Dogg and later utilized by commentator Jerry Lawler.|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork {{was photographed}} by Harry Langdon in the {{swimming}} pool of the Jackson family's home. Jackson described Langdon as [...] "the sweetest man imaginable". She took inspiration from a photograph of actress Elizabeth Taylor submerged {{in a swimming pool}} which was taken early in her career. In the photograph, nothing could be seen apart from Taylor's face above the water; her body was hidden beneath the surface. Jackson thought the pose was dramatic and loved the fact that she could do the same thing, and not to have to reveal anything except for her face. With the photographer, his assistant and other people around the pool, she was still reluctant to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> robe, and stand there in her bathing suit. She waited until everybody got distracted to slip into the pool. After they took the photos, she waited until everybody was gone {{to get out of the}} pool.|$|E
500|$|... "Sweet Love" [...] {{is a slow}} jam R ballad that {{displays}} {{elements of}} electronic music; it lasts for a duration of three minutes and 19 seconds long. The instrumentation is provided by a keyboard, synthesizers, percussion and a drum machine. According to Nadeska Alexis of MTVs Rapfix, Brown sings in a falsetto tone, which she found to be reminiscent of Michael Jackson. Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush described the ballad as [...] "very Michael Jackson and neo-Bieber". JusMusic of Singersroom noted that [...] "Sweet Love" [...] is inspired by Silk's [...] "Freak Me" [...] (1993). Chris Brown – Sweet Love|work=Singersroom|date=2012-05-25|accessdate=2012-05-27}} Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun musically compared the song to Prince. The theme of [...] "Sweet Love" [...] revolves around sex. It contains lyrics about Brown asking his lover to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> clothes {{so that they can}} have sex. During the chorus, he harmonizes: [...] "Oooh baby let's get naked / Just so we can make sweet love / All these sensations got me going crazy for you / Inside on top of you / Grinding inside and out of you / Baby I know what to do / Let's just take our clothes off".|$|E

Mrs. William may be <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> {{balance by}} Earth; as for example, last Sunday week, when sloppy and greasy, and she {{going out to}} tea with her newest sister-in-law, and having a pride in herself, and wishing to appear {{perfectly}} spotless though pedestrian.

But these are elements. Mrs. William must be taken out of elements for the strength of HER character to come into play." ...|$|R

500|$|Upon {{her arrival}} at Singapore on 13 January 1942, Exeter was {{assigned}} to the ABDACOM naval force that was intended to defend the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) from Japanese invasion. She spent the first several weeks of February escorting convoys in the East Indies. On 13 February, Allied reconnaissance aircraft spotted Japanese invasion convoys north of Bangka Island and the new commander of ABDA naval forces, Vice Admiral Conrad Helfrich of the Royal Netherlands Navy, was ordered to assemble the Allied Striking Force of Exeter and three Dutch and one Australian light cruisers at Oosthaven on the morning of 14 February. Escorted by six American and three Dutch destroyers, the force departed that afternoon. The Dutch Rear Admiral Karel Doorman, commanding the force, took his ships through the Gaspar Strait and then northwest towards Bangka Island. While passing through the strait, the Dutch destroyer [...] struck a rock in poor visibility and another Dutch destroyer was tasked to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> crew. The Japanese spotted the Allied ships around 08:00 and repeatedly attacked them. The first was a group of seven Nakajima B5N [...] "Kate" [...] torpedo bombers from the light carrier [...] that attacked Exeter with bombs around 10:30. The blast from a near miss badly damaged her Walrus, but the ship was only damaged by splinters. They were followed shortly afterwards by a group of 23 Mitsubishi G3M [...] "Nell" [...] bombers from the Genzan Air Group that inflicted no damage as they dropped their bombs from high altitude. Another group of six B5Ns attacked without effect at 11:30.|$|E
500|$|During fleet {{training}} held in March 1912, Elsass accidentally {{collided with}} a Swedish steamshipin heavy fog in the western entrance to the Skagerrak on 23 March. Pollux was badly damaged in the accident and sank, though Elsass was able to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> crew. In April, Elsass served as a target ship during gunfire training with the armored cruiser [...] in a demonstration held off the Faroe Islands. On the 29th of the month, the new dreadnought battleship [...] replaced Elsass in the I Squadron, and the latter had her crew reduced. On 24 August, the ship received her full complement again, to allow Elsass {{to take part in}} the annual maneuvers with the newly-formed III Squadron. She also came under the temporary command of KzS Leberecht Maass. After the exercises ended, the squadron was dissolved, and on 29 September Elsass again had her crew reduced. She returned to active duty on 1 December, when she was assigned to the V Division of the III Squadron, along with her sister ship [...] and the new dreadnought [...] The ships began the year with individual training, followed by divisional exercises in the Baltic later in January 1913. In early March, fleet exercises were held in the North Sea. Elsass was sent to Kiel on 17 March to begin preparations for her decommissioning, as her place in the division was taken by the new battleship [...] On 13 May, Elsass was decommissioned and assigned to the Reserve Division of the Baltic Sea. From 15 October, she was assigned to the Marinestation der Ostsee (Naval Station of the Baltic Sea).|$|E

Following his murder Grace refuses to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> wedding dress and remains {{in it for}} several episodes. Filming Grace's grief was Wall's most {{challenging}} story during her tenure because it involved playing Grace [...] "down" [...] for prolonged time. She explained [...] "the aftermath of Trevor's death was hard because it involved peeling back every layer of Grace, {{to the point where}} she had nothing. She didn't take her wedding dress off for a week!" [...] The actress added that she was unsure Grace would ever discover Nico actually killed her husband.|$|E
2500|$|When {{news of the}} Fraser Canyon Gold Rush reached California, Hunts owners {{sent her}} north to take {{advantage}} of the situation. [...] Hunt arrived in Victoria in the middle of August, 1858. [...] Because there was a shortage of British vessels, the colonial government at Victoria had decided to license American steamers to move the resultant gold rush traffic up the river. [...] and ran for a short time on the New Westminster route. [...] Another vessel running on the same route was the Sea Bird, which on September 7, 1858, caught fire en route and was destroyed, with the loss of two lives. [...] Fortunately the Hunt was not far behind her and was able to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> surviving passengers and crew.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sculptor}} Emile-Antoine Bourdelle had met Isadora in 1903 at Auguste Rodin's picnic, and in 1909 he saw {{her dance}} on stage. The 'nymph' who had been persuaded to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> skirt and dance on the grass in her muslin petticoat had become a beautiful muse. Bourdelle had previously been asked to decorate {{the facade of the}} planned Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. When {{he saw her}} he realized that Isadora was his muse: [...] "To me it seemed that there, through her, was animated an ineffable frieze wherein divine frescoes slowly became human realities. Each leap, each attitude of the great artist remains in my memory like flashes of lightning." [...] Bourdelle would return from the theatre and sketch for hours. His images of Isadora are the most varied, for they convey not only Isadora but the vast range of emotions she embodied.|$|E

2500|$|Love and Erlandson {{began writing}} new {{material}} for a second Hole album in 1992, {{in the midst of}} Love's pregnancy with Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. Love's desire to take the band in a more melodic and controlled rock format led bassist Emery to leave the band, and drummer Caroline Rue followed. In an advertisement to find a new bass player, Love wrote: [...] " [...] someone who can play ok, and stand in front of 30,000 people, <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> shirt and have 'fuck you' written on her tits. If you're not afraid of me and you're not afraid to fucking say it, send a letter. No more pussies, no more fake girls, I want a whore from hell." [...] In April 1992, drummer Patty Schemel was recruited after an audition in Los Angeles, but the band {{spent the rest of the}} year without a consistent bassist.|$|E
2500|$|Glasgow {{meanwhile}} {{concentrated on}} T25, which soon after sustained {{hits in the}} region of the aft torpedo tubes, the Flakvierling and the 3.7 cm flak platforms, which killed or wounded all their crews. Then a second shell struck the German torpedo boat, which completely destroyed the mast as well as the funnel. T25 was now a sitting duck and requested T22 to attempt to come alongside and <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> crew. Glasgow shifted to T26, which was quickly [...] by near misses. T22 had both cruisers on her port side, and, in an effort to drive them off while she closed in on her damaged consort, she fired her full spread of torpedoes and opened fire with her guns. The torpedoes passed harmlessly by their targets, and as T22 turned to starboard towards T25, she too was bracketed by near misses. T22 abandoned the rescue after suffering another hit, then laid smoke, fired her guns and withdrew to the south-west. T26 was still under fire and was soon severely hit in the boiler room, and as T22 laid smoke to screen her, the damaged ship signalled that she was sinking; T22 turned northwards and broke away.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Grant {{wrote her}} first song ("Mountain Man"), {{performed}} in {{public for the}} first time at Harpeth Hall School, the all-girls school she attended in Nashville. She recorded a demo tape for her parents with church youth-leader Brown Bannister. When Bannister was dubbing a copy of the tape, Chris Christian, the owner of the recording studio, heard the demo and called Word Records. He played it over the phone, and she was offered a recording contract, five weeks before her 16th birthday. In 1977, she recorded her first album titled Amy Grant, produced by Brown Bannister, who would also produce her next 11 albums. It was released in early 1978, one month before her high-school graduation. Toward the end of 1978 she performed her first ticketed concert after beginning her first year at Furman University. In May 1979, while at the album-release party for her second album, My Father's Eyes, Grant met Gary Chapman, who had written the title track and would become her first husband. [...] Grant and Chapman toured together in mid-1979. In late 1980, she transferred to Vanderbilt University, where she was a member of the sorority Kappa Alpha Theta. Grant then made a few more albums before dropping out of college to pursue a career in music—Never Alone, followed by a pair of live albums in 1981 (In Concert and In Concert Volume Two), both backed by an augmented edition of the DeGarmo & Key band. It was during these early shows that Grant also established one of her concert trademarks: performing barefoot. To date, Grant continues to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> shoes midway through performances, as she has said [...] "it is just more comfortable." ...|$|E
