5|$|In the west, NY186 {{begins at}} NY30 in Harrietstown, near the eastern bank of Lake Clear. Known as Lake Clear Road, NY186 heads east-northeastward, {{crossing}} {{a pair of}} train tracks and later a creek. Situated within the forested terrain of <b>the</b> <b>Adirondack</b> State Park, the highway passes to the south of, and serves, <b>the</b> <b>Adirondack</b> Regional Airport. South of the airport NY186 intersects several local roads. The highway turns more towards the northeast upon passing the airport, and proceeds uneventfully. Subsequent to turning towards the east, NY186 terminates at NY86, still within Harrietstown.|$|E
5|$|NY28 briefly reenters Herkimer County, {{but does}} not have any major junctions. NY28 passes the Fulton Chain Lakes, among several other large lakes, as it winds through <b>the</b> <b>Adirondack</b> Park.|$|E

5000|$|As a {{professor}} in the Division of Forestry at Paul Smith's College, he has written three books on the vegetation of <b>the</b> <b>Adirondacks,</b> including Adirondack Upland Flora, a number of articles on forest history of both <b>the</b> Catskills and <b>Adirondacks.</b> [...] As a railroad historian, he wrote Where Did The Tracks Go?, an initial description of railroads in <b>the</b> <b>Adirondacks,</b> followed by Railroads of <b>the</b> <b>Adirondacks,</b> for a long time considered the definitive work on the subject. He has retired from Paul Smiths, moved to the Catskills, and is working on a four-volume set on the Mountain Railroads of New York State. It updates Railroads of <b>the</b> <b>Adirondacks</b> in <b>the</b> first three volumes, and adds a fourth volume covering the Catskills.|$|R

5|$|Exit6 on <b>the</b> <b>Adirondack</b> Northway was {{originally}} a diamond interchange. Construction {{to convert the}} junction into a single-point urban interchange began in mid-2008 and was completed on September 12, 2010. The {{total cost of the}} project was $41.9million.|$|E
5|$|NY30 {{historically}} followed School Street {{through the}} village of Mayfield. The new routing has it heading toward Riceville, where NY30A rejoins NY30. Here, <b>the</b> <b>Adirondack</b> Trail begins as NY30 turns right, following the right-of-way of NY30A into Adirondack Park shortly before entering Mayfield.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{mentions}} of fishers in literature occurred in The Audubon Book of True Nature Stories. Robert Snyder relates a tale of his encounter with fishers in the woods of <b>the</b> <b>Adirondack</b> Mountains of New York. He recounts three sightings, including one where he witnessed a fisher attacking a porcupine.|$|E

5|$|In Deerfield, Oneida County, NY28 splits from NY8. NY28 {{crosses the}} West Canada Creek and leaves Oneida County for about , then re-crosses {{the creek and}} enters Oneida County again. In Trenton, NY28 joins NY12 northward toward Barneveld. In Barneveld, NY12 and NY28 {{intersect}} NY365. NY28 splits from NY12 in Remsen and heads toward the northeast, passing through numerous lakes and reservoirs. In Forestport, it enters Adirondack Park as it parallels <b>the</b> <b>Adirondack</b> Mountains.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, NY365's old routing between Harrietstown and Gabriels was {{designated}} as NY192A, a spur route of NY192. NY192A {{was removed from}} the state highway system on January7, 1980, when NY192 was rerouted east of Gabriels to follow NY192A. On March28, 1989, NY192 was eliminated {{in much the same way}} as its spur route as NY86 was rerouted to follow NY192 through Gabriels to Paul Smiths. NY86's former routing past <b>the</b> <b>Adirondack</b> Regional Airport became NY186.|$|E
5|$|Much of NY9N runs {{alongside}} {{either a}} river or a lake. It follows the Hudson River through northern Saratoga County and southern Warren County, {{the entirety of}} Lake George's western shoreline, the west edge of Lake Champlain between Ticonderoga and Westport, and the Ausable River from Keene to Keeseville. The other portions of NY9N pass through predominantly rural and mountainous regions of <b>the</b> <b>Adirondack</b> Mountains.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Adirondacks</b> {{buildings}} were recognized for their rugged finish and outstanding craftsmanship especially by the wealthy locals. <b>The</b> <b>Adirondacks</b> style of architecture can be specialized into custom homes, rugged roofing, log cabins, boat houses, rustic furnishing, rustic kitchen, birch and cedar furniture, log and twig works.|$|R

5|$|NY30 {{runs through}} the Adirondacks, {{accessing}} communities such as Speculator, Blue Mountain Lake, and Tupper Lake as a scenic byway named <b>the</b> <b>Adirondack</b> Trail. From Wells to Speculator, NY30 is concurrent to NY8, then with NY28 from Indian Lake to Blue Mountain Lake. Between Blue Mountain Lake and Long Lake, NY30 is concurrent with the western third of NY28N.|$|E
5|$|After , {{the road}} bent {{back to the}} east, leaving the {{woodlands}} behind as it passed south of the Miner Institute. The research complex led to another stretch of isolated homes along NY191, centered on the route's interchange with <b>the</b> <b>Adirondack</b> Northway (I-87). Not far from the junction, NY191 entered the hamlet of Chazy, a small community located on the Little Chazy River. The route bypassed most of Chazy, skirting {{the northern edge of}} the hamlet as it headed northeast to a junction with US9. NY191 ended here while CR23 follows the state-maintained US9 south into downtown Chazy.|$|E
5|$|At Willsboro, Route22 {{heads to}} the {{northwest}} again, away from the lake, until it heads west and intersects US9 {{in the town of}} Chesterfield, the other major north–south surface route up the state's eastern side. Routes22 and 9 join together, closely parallel to <b>the</b> <b>Adirondack</b> Northway (I-87), the only other route in the state to directly connect New York City with Canada. The three routes, spread over many miles {{in the southern part of}} the state, run through a narrow corridor for two miles (3km) until Routes9 and 22 veer east again toward Keeseville.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after this}} junction, NY22 begins a long curve {{away from the}} state line that has it running due west {{at the end of}} NY40 in North Granville. It heads {{northwest}} a little further until, after passing between Great Meadows and Washington state prisons, it reaches US4 and turns right to join it, resuming its northward course. The overlap with US4, one of the few along Route22 that pairs it with another north–south route, lasts for seven miles (11km) along the base of <b>the</b> <b>Adirondack</b> foothills between the low country and Lake George, before ending in Whitehall, where US4 leaves to assume the east–west course it takes across northern New England.|$|E
5|$|NY73 was {{truncated}} to {{its current}} eastern terminus in Underwood , eliminating a lengthy overlap with US9, while its former routing from Schroon to Lake Champlain was renumbered to NY74, matching the other Vermont route number that ends in Larrabees Point. The already existing NY74 in Chautauqua County (in the Jamestown area) was renumbered to NY474 as a result. The opening of <b>the</b> <b>Adirondack</b> Northway in 1967 also resulted in a slight shift of the western terminus of NY74 from US9 to I-87. By 1981, NY74 was rerouted to follow its current alignment around the northeastern edge of Ticonderoga, on a concurrency with NY22. The highway has remained the same since that date.|$|E
5|$|Near Tupper Lake, it skirts the {{boundary}} between Franklin and Saint Lawrence for a considerable distance before entering Tupper Lake and intersecting NY3. The two routes overlap to Harrietstown, where NY30 splits from NY3 and heads north along a series of lakes, including Upper Saranac Lake and Meacham Lake. North of Duane, NY30 exits Adirondack Park and heads north towards Malone. Within the village, NY30 briefly overlaps US11. <b>The</b> <b>Adirondack</b> Trail ends at {{the east end of}} the overlap. The route continues north out of the village to the Canada–US border in Constable, where it becomes Route138 upon entering Quebec at the Trout River Border Crossing.|$|E

It has been recorded in New Zealand. In South Africa, it grows with Pinus radiata.|$|E
5|$|The Seaman brothers, Daryl and Byron, {{had made}} an offer of $14 million while the City of Calgary {{prepared}} {{to build a new}} arena for the team. However, Canadian businessman Nelson Skalbania emerged as a rival bidder for the team before joining the Calgary consortium. The group agreed to purchase the Flames for $16 million, at the time the highest price ever paid for a National Hockey League franchise. The sale was announced on May 21, 1980, and the franchise relocated to Canada where it became the Calgary Flames. The Flames have since used the Atlanta logo for both its alternate captains, and the team's former affiliate that played in the American Hockey League, <b>the</b> <b>Adirondack</b> Flames.|$|E
