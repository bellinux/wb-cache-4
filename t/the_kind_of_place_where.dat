All contributions made went towards the organization's mortgage payment fund that was matched by a committee, led by Eisenberg. [...] "It's an incredible collective," [...] Eisenberg told a reporter.

2500|$|Shorter brought six new {{compositions}} to the Christmas Eve session. According to Shorter (as {{quoted in}} Don Heckman's liner notes), {{in writing the}} material for this album he was [...] "thinking of misty landscapes with wild flowers and strange, dimly-seen shapes — <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> folklore and legends are born. And then I was thinking of things like witch burnings too." [...] Fairy tales were also an inspiration: the bluesy [...] "Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum" [...] is titled after the trademark exclamation of the giant in Jack and the Beanstalk.|$|E
2500|$|A {{worker at}} DC Central Kitchen saw Tracht's apology on TV and heard {{his desire to}} show he was sorry. She thought that the [...] "Kitchen" [...] {{would be a good}} place for him to prove himself, and shared the idea with a co-worker who knew Rock Newman; he made a phone call. Soon, Tracht was mopping floors and {{cleaning}} bathrooms for four hours a day, several times a week. He volunteered for four months, laboring with unemployed and homeless people. Of the experience, Tracht stated: [...] "It's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> you can rediscover yourself. I did things I'd never done in my life. I went in there like an idiot, and now I know how to clean and mop, how to shovel and unload, how to slice and dice." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eggleston {{was sent}} to the Webb School, a {{boarding}} establishment. Eggleston later recalled few fond memories of the school, telling a reporter, [...] "It had a kind of Spartan routine to 'build character'. I never knew what that was supposed to mean. It was so callous and dumb. It was <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> it was considered effeminate to like music and painting." [...] Eggleston was unusual among his peers in eschewing the traditional Southern male pursuits of hunting and sports, in favor of artistic pursuits and observation of the world. Nevertheless, Eggleston noted that he never felt like an outsider. [...] "I never had the feeling that I didn't fit in," [...] he told a reporter, [...] "But probably I didn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's why I like it! I'm {{quite happy}} there; {{but this is}} <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> I belong. Twice before I met my husband I helped make a new home on the plains, and this spot {{reminds me of the}} last time. We fixed camp by Stony Creek in early summer, when the grass was green and all the flowers were out. There were rows of the red prairie lilies. I never saw so many!--and I {{remember}} how the new birch leaves used to rustle in the bluff at night. Thinking of it somehow hurts me." [...] She laughed prettily. [...] "I'm what Tom calls a sentimentalist." ...|$|E
60|$|About midday I came to where, in {{a secluded}} valley, there stood a single small cottage without any other {{building}} in sight. It was a neat little house, with a rustic porch {{and a small}} garden in front of it, with a swarm of cocks and hens. I lay down among the ferns and watched it, for {{it seemed to be}} exactly <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> I might obtain what I wanted. My bread was finished, and I was exceedingly hungry after my long journey; I determined, therefore, to make a short reconnaissance, and then to march up to this cottage, summon it to surrender, and help myself to all that I needed. It could at least provide me with a chicken and with an omelette. My mouth watered at the thought.|$|E

5000|$|Michiko Kakutani {{wrote in}} her New York Times review of Sort of Rich: [...] "Tula Springs {{is one of those}} {{peculiar}} outposts of the New South - half suburb, half small town, poised between a quickly receding pastoral past and a greedy, consumerist future. It's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> people are ignorant about the details of the Civil War, but up on the latest kinds of sunlamps and Jacuzzis; <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> long-haired ex-hippies cheerfully vote for Reagan, and housewives divide their time between therapy sessions and church choir meetings." [...] Other reviewers have compared Tula Springs to William Faulkner's fictional Yoknapatawpha County.|$|E

5000|$|Baylor {{ought to}} be <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> a student can ask a {{question}} and not just get the runaround.

50|$|Urban Appalachians {{are also}} diverse in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> {{they lived in}} before migration. Many came from coal camps in the Cumberland Plateau or Allegheny Mountains.

5000|$|Ripton {{is a town}} in Addison County, Vermont, United States. The {{population}} was 588 at the 2010 census. The Bread Loaf Writers' Conference is held annually in Ripton.

50|$|Natu {{does not}} believe Sinestro, but he tells her a convincing story of her parentage. Shortly after her birth, Sinestro came to the {{conclusion}} that the disorganized and chaotic world of Korugar was not <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> that he wanted to raise his daughter, and began his crusade to bring order to his people by force with his powers as a Green Lantern.|$|R

5000|$|Poitier {{credits his}} parents and his {{childhood}} on tiny Cat Island in the Bahamas for equipping him with the unflinching {{sense of right and}} wrong and of self-worth that he has never surrendered and that have dramatically shaped his world.

60|$|But blowing your {{brains out}} is a noisy, rackety performance, and Pupkin soon found that only special <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> brains are suited for it.
