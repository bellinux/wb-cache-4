5|$|After Raju and {{his team}} {{retrieve}} the gold, they are detained by local police. Raju identifies himself as a RAW agent {{and his team}} as intelligence officers from various agencies of India. He discloses his real name as Rajeev Sathyamoorthy. The police release <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> can complete their investigation and allows them {{to go back to}} Mumbai. Near the end of the film, it is revealed that Raju and his team are the actual smugglers.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, Manoj and Babli, {{accompanied}} {{by a team of}} five police officers assigned to them for protection, left for Chandigarh. The police left them at Pipli and slipped away. Suspecting foul play, Manoj and Babli did not continue toward Chandigarh, instead boarding a bus for Karnal. According to a statement filed by Chanderpati, later that day, around 3:40pm, she received a call from a Pipli telephone booth from Manoj, who said that the police had deserted them, and Babli's family members were trailing <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> would try to take a bus to Delhi and call her back later. Babli asked for acceptance from Chanderpati, who replied affirmatively. That was the last time Manoj's family heard from the couple.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Brinkley {{left his}} family to try to regain the thread of his education, this time in St. Louis, Missouri. He was unable to pay Bennett Medical College the tuition he owed <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> refused to forward his {{scholastic}} records {{to any of the}} medical schools that Brinkley had approached. Instead, Brinkley bought a certificate from a shady diploma mill known as the Kansas City Eclectic Medical University and returned home. On February 11, 1913, his daughter Naomi Beryl Brinkley was born. The family of five immediately moved to New York City, and shortly thereafter to Chicago. When Brinkley refused to give up his goal of becoming a doctor, Sally Brinkley left him one final time, taking the three girls home to North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|The {{second set}} of colonists disembarked from the Kennersley Castle in late March 1823. Their {{optimism}} was quickly extinguished. Hall returned in April with disheartening news: he had found no ship that could help and, far from considering them any responsibility of his, King George Frederic Augustus had not even been aware of their presence. The Kennersley Castle having sailed, MacGregor's victims could count on no assistance in the near future. The emigrants had brought ample provisions with them, including medicines, and had two doctors among <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> were not in a totally hopeless situation, but apart from Hall none of the military officers, government officials or civil servants appointed by MacGregor made any serious attempt to organise the party.|$|E
5|$|A battle {{fought in}} this zone and tragic for the Israelis was {{completely}} eclipsed from their collective memory. On 18 July, a company from the 1st Battalion of Yiftach Brigade received {{the order to}} capture Qirbet Quriqur, an outpost protecting {{the only way for}} the Legion to get to Latrun located several kilometres {{to the north of the}} place. Intelligence services had not informed the responsible officer that nearby there was another outpost, occupied by a reinforced company of the Legion. From there the legionnaires could observe all the operations of the Israelis and called for reinforcements, notably armoured vehicles. When they mounted the counter-attack, the Israelis were taken by a lightning strike in an encircling movement. No troops were available there to reinforce <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> had to retreat in plain daylight. 45 Israeli soldiers, nineteen of them aged 18 or less, lost their lives.|$|E
5|$|Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) {{find out}} that Dave was {{planning}} on marrying Linda; however, as the two were an interracial couple, they gained an enemy in Eric Singleton (Alexander Cendese), who stole the engagement ring out of the couple’s car, but after they were dead. Megan later finds residue in Linda's eyes {{to suggest that the}} killer closed her eyes after she died, which leads them back to Linda's parents, who knew that Dave intended to propose. When they call the two into the office, Al admits he killed Dave and Linda. He had only wanted to scare <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> would not marry; however, the gun discharged, killing Linda, and in panic, he killed Dave too. After apologizing to Laura, Al is taken away. Throughout the day, Megan tries to reconnect with her daughter Lacey (Mary Mouser); however, her attempts to create a better relationship with her backfire.|$|E

5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit system will be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E
5|$|Nojima {{was charged}} with writing the {{scenario}} and with unifying the team members' ideas into a cohesive narrative, as Kitase was impressed with his earlier work on the mystery-like Heracles no Eikō III: Kamigami no Chinmoku, an entry in the Glory of Heracles series. To make the characters seem more realistic, Nojima wrote <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> would not unanimously agree, with some raising objections instead: while this inevitably slowed down {{the pace of the}} story, it added depth to the characters. The graphical improvements enabled even relatively bland lines of dialogue to be enhanced. As the inclusion of voice acting would have lead to significant load times, it was decided to be omitted. Another writer who contributed was Masato Kato, who wrote several late-game scenes including the Lifestream sequence and Cloud and Tifa's conversation before the final battle. Initially not involved with the project, he was called upon to help flesh out less important story scenes. He wrote his scenes to his own tastes without outside consultation, something he later regretted.|$|E
5|$|Other seeds, such as apple pips and plum stones, have fleshy {{receptacles}} {{and smaller}} fruits like hawthorns have seeds enclosed in edible tissue; animals including mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the seeds, or swallow <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> {{pass through the}} gut to be deposited in the animal's droppings {{well away from the}} parent tree. The germination of some seeds is improved when they are processed in this way. Nuts may be gathered by animals such as squirrels that cache any not immediately consumed. Many of these caches are never revisited, the nut-casing softens with rain and frost, and the seed germinates in the spring. Pine cones may similarly be hoarded by red squirrels, and grizzly bears may help to disperse the seed by raiding squirrel caches.|$|E

5|$|Various {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that several individuals would gather eggs in a single nest, and arrange <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> could be protected by one individual, possibly a male. In 2010 David J. Varricchio and colleagues found that the relatively large clutch-size of oviraptorids and troodontids is most similar to those of modern archosaurs (birds and crocodilians, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs) that practice polygamous mating and extensive male parental care (as seen in paleognaths such as ostriches and emus). This reproductive system pre-dates the origin of birds and would therefore be the ancestral condition for modern birds, with biparental care (where both parents participate) being a later development. Many oviraptorosaurs are known to have had pygostyles on the end of their tails, which suggests the presence of feather-fans; these could have been used for intraspecific communication such as courtship rituals.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{arrive in}} Comity after arguing over {{directions}} along the way. They meet a local detective, Angela White (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), {{and go to}} Boom's funeral. Scully, in a bad mood, is skeptical of these claims. The high school principal, Bob Spitz, interrupts the funeral by ranting Inquisitorial-style about Satanic cults murdering their children when suddenly the coffin starts smoking and catches on fire. Mulder and Scully go into separate rooms to interview Margi and Terri, both of whom offer an identical story about a satanic ceremony where a baby was sacrificed. Scully thinks their stories are cliché and points {{out the fact that}} the belief in a satanic conspiracy is illogical and paranoid. Looking at the latest victim's body, Mulder and Detective White find a burn mark {{in the shape of a}} horned beast; Scully says she doesn't see anything. Mulder goes to see White to apologize for Scully's behavior and the two visit the local astrologist Madame Zirinka who claims the town's crazy behavior is due to the rare planetary alignment of the planets Mars, Uranus, and Mercury. Terri and Margi watch basketball practice, lusting over one of the players, Scott, whose girlfriend is fellow cheerleader Brenda (much to Terri and Margi's displeasure). One of the other players accidentally spills a table of drinks on <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> cause the basketball to bounce underneath the bleachers and it closes when he goes to get it, killing him. Scully is angry at Mulder for ditching her to be with Detective White.|$|E
5|$|Marco knew four languages, and {{the family}} had {{accumulated}} {{a great deal of}} knowledge and experience that was useful to Kublai. It is possible that he became a government official; he wrote about many imperial visits to China's southern and eastern provinces, the far south and Burma. They were highly respected and sought after in the Mongolian court, and so Kublai Khan decided to decline the Polos' requests to leave China. They became worried about returning home safely, believing that if Kublai died, his enemies might turn against them because of their close involvement with the ruler. In 1292, Kublai's great-nephew, then ruler of Persia, sent representatives to China in search of a potential wife, and they asked the Polos to accompany <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> were permitted to return to Persia with the wedding party—which left that same year from Zaitun in southern China on a fleet of 14 junks. The party sailed to the port of Singapore, travelled north to Sumatra, and sailed west to the Point Pedro port of Jaffna under Savakanmaindan and to Pandyan of Tamilakkam. Eventually Polo crossed the Arabian Sea to Hormuz. The two-year voyage was a perilous one—of the six hundred people (not including the crew) in the convoy only eighteen had survived (including all three Polos). The Polos left the wedding party after reaching Hormuz and travelled overland to the port of Trebizond on the Black Sea, the present day Trabzon.|$|E
