5|$|Barquq was {{restored}} {{to power in}} 1390, after which the <b>Turkmen</b> tribesmen raided the hills around Beirut once more, although {{they were unable to}} capture the villages of Ainab and Aramoun. Under Barquq's direction, the Mamluks mobilized their army troops, Druze warriors, and tribesmen from the Beqaa Valley and dealt a heavy blow against the Turkmens of Keserwan. Nonetheless, Barquq decided to keep the <b>Turkmen</b> emirs as the lords of Keserwan, albeit in a weakened state. Barquq likely kept the Turkmens in place to avoid giving the Buhturids too much power in Mount Lebanon or to avoid over-extending Buhturid forces. According to Salibi, only four <b>Turkmen</b> emirs have been named in primary sources: a certain Sa'id who ruled in 1361, his brother and successor Isa, and a certain Ali ibn al-A'ma and his brother Umar ibn al-A'ma. The latter two were the <b>Turkmen</b> emirs involved in the rebellion against Barquq. Ali was killed in Barquq's punitive expedition, while Umar was imprisoned and released.|$|E
5|$|In 1382, the Mamluk emir Barquq usurped {{the throne}} in Cairo, {{establishing}} the Burji regime. The latter were ethnic Circassians unlike their <b>Turkmen</b> Bahri predecessors, {{which resulted in}} frayed relations between the Turkmens of Keserwan and the new rulers. The tensions between the Turkmens of Keserwan and the Burji authorities contrasted with the Turkmens' principal rivals in Mount Lebanon, the Druze Buhturids, who embraced Sultan Barquq. When the latter was briefly toppled in a Bahri revolt in 1389, the Buhturids fought against the Bahri rebels in Damascus, while the <b>Turkmen</b> tribesmen assaulted the Druze Tanukhi tribesmen in Beirut and the surrounding hills. In those engagements and the executions that followed, the Turkmens killed seven of the eight Tanukhi Abi al-Jaysh Arslan emirs, Druze allies of the Buhturids.|$|E
5|$|Mansur was {{regularly}} {{assigned the}} tax farms of the nawahi of Keserwan, Jbeil, Batroun, Bsharri, Kura and Dinniyah. Mansur installed {{members of the}} Hubaysh clan as his chief agents in Keserwan, particularly investing sheikhs Yusuf and Sulayman Hubaysh as his stewards. Mansur also became the patron of the <b>Turkmen</b> Sayfa clan, who entered the region as Ottoman levend (auxiliary troops) in 1528. He installed the Sayfas as his subordinate tax farmers in Akkar, provoking opposition from Muhammad Shu'ayb, who was killed by Mansur later that year. Mansur subsequently had Shu'ayb replaced with Yusuf Sayfa as his chief agent in Tripoli. Mansur proceeded to eliminate his Muslim rivals between then and 1541. Among those killed were the Kurdish Ottoman official in charge of Batroun, a couple of Shia sheikhs from Keserwan, a rival <b>Turkmen</b> clan in Keserwan and the sheikhs of the Bedouin Ibn al-Hansh tribe; the latter were executed at a reception held by Mansur in Ghazir.|$|E

5|$|The Assafs were Sunni Muslims {{and ethnic}} Turkmens. In 1306, the Mamluks {{installed}} the Assaf tribe as the lords of Keserwan after defeating the Shia Muslims who politically dominated Keserwan {{and were the}} majority population in the area. The Assafs-based themselves in the Keserwani village of Ghazir, which became the tribe's headquarters. The Assaf were entrusted by the Mamluks of maintaining a 300-strong cavalry unit to patrol the region between Beirut and Jbeil and to guard entry into the Keserwan from Beirut. Historian Kamal Salibi asserts that <b>Turkmen</b> tribesmen were settled in Keserwan after the Mamluk conquest in 1305, but does not specify {{that it was the}} Assaf tribe that became lords of the region. Under Assaf or <b>Turkmen</b> lordship, Shia influence in Keserwan dwindled; they remained the majority in the region due to continual immigration from the Beqaa Valley, but were forced out of the coastal areas of Keserwan and their population declined. In addition, the Alawite population in the region largely disappeared under Assaf lordship.|$|E

5|$|Mansur was {{dismissed}} in 1579 {{and replaced by}} his son Muhammad, who was imprisoned by the authorities in 1584 for alleged involvement in a looting raid against an Istanbul-bound caravan. He was restored to Keserwan in 1585 and was given tax collection authority over the rural districts of Tripoli Eyalet; this brought him into conflict with the Sayfa clan, the Assafs' erstwhile <b>Turkmen</b> clients, one of whose members, Yusuf Pasha Sayfa, was governor of Tripoli. The Assaf realm dissipated in 1591 when Muhammad was killed while attempting to collect taxes from the Sayfas in Akkar.

40|$|The <b>Turkmans</b> {{are one of}} the Iranian ethnic population. HLA typing (class I and II) was {{performed}} in this population. The data obtained from this study was compared with different populations of the world. We observed that the <b>Turkman</b> population is most similar to the Northern chinese and Uigur population. The distributions of HLA antigens in <b>Turkmans</b> are somewhat between Iranian population, Northern chinese and Uigur population. Natural selection and gene alteration select the people who could better adopt themselves with new conditions. Investigation of Turkman's HLA in comparison with Iranian's HLA reveals more details in genetics of Behcet's disease.

The schools and students were chosen by multistage sampling (cluster and random sampling). Breastfeeding was categorized based on World Health Organization classification. Breast-feeding during the first 6 postpartum months and two postpartum years was found in 5. 8 and 57. 1 % of children. Breast-feeding during the two postpartum years was significantly 12. 5 % more in <b>Turkman</b> ethnic group than non-Turkman ethnic group (P = 0. 001) but breast-feeding only for the first 6 postpartum months was 1. 9 % in <b>Turkman</b> ethnic group less than in non-Turkman ethnic group (P = 0. 002). There was a negative significant association between economic status and breast-feeding during the two postpartum years in both ethnic groups (P = 0. 001) and there was more breast feeding in the first 6 postpartum months in <b>Turkman</b> ethnic group. Breast-feeding rate in <b>Turkman</b> ethnic group is more common than non-Turkman ethnic group.

5|$|Aqil's father, Musa Agha al-Hasi, {{himself a}} {{commander}} of Hawwara irregulars {{in the service}} of Acre's Ottoman governors, had left Egypt for Gaza in 1814. He was not directly related to the Ainawiyeh or Hawwara tribes, but claimed descent from the Hawwara as a matter of convenience and prestige. Musa originally hailed from the al-Bara'asa tribe of Cyrenaica (modern-day eastern Libya). Likewise, James Finn, the British consul in Jerusalem (1846–1863), claims Aqil's family was of Algerian or North African origin. Musa Agha resided in the Galilee around 1820 and married a <b>Turkmen</b> woman. Aqil was born to the couple in the Nazareth area. According to historian Adel Manna, Aqil was born in Gaza.

40|$|Anthropometric {{dimensions}} {{are the basis}} for the evaluation of the health of newborns. This research was conducted in view of the importance of anthropometric indices of the head and face in forensic medicine, surgery, pediatrics and medical imaging. The study was undertaken on 423 normal one - day old female newborns of the Pars and <b>Turkman</b> race (<b>Turkman</b> group: No= 211, Pars group No= 212). Means and SD of cephalic and prosopic indices in the native Pars group were 78. 63 Â± 4. 7, 74. 3 Â± 11. 5 and in the <b>Turkman</b> group they were 77. 85 Â± 8. 7, 81. 6 Â± 9. 8 respectively. The dominant and rare types of head shape in the native Pars group were mesocephalic (44. 98 %) and hyper-brachycephalic (8. 96 %) respectively, while in the <b>Turkman</b> group they were mesocephalic (38. 86 %) and hyperbrachycephalic (8. 05 %). The dominant type of face shape in the native Fars group was hypereuriprosopic (71 %) and in the <b>Turkman</b> group it was mesoprosopic (39 %).

5|$|According to {{historian}} Muhammad Adnan Bakhit, {{reliable information}} about the Assafs in the early 16th century is relatively scarce. A certain Emir Assaf from among the <b>Turkmen</b> tribesmen of Keserwan was appointed by Ottoman sultan Selim I as governor of the Keserwan nahiya (subdistrict; pl. nawahi) of the Safad Sanjak (Beirut Sanjak) after the Ottomans {{took control of the}} Levant from the Mamluks in 1516. Sultan Selim I assigned the Assafs as his chief agents in the region between Beirut and Tripoli, confirming their control of Keserwan, and awarding them tax farms in the nawahi of Jbeil and Beirut. While Emir Assaf had lived in Aintoura in the winter and elsewhere along the Nahr al-Kalb ridge prior to the Ottoman conquest, in 1517, he moved his headquarters to Ghazir. The move to the latter village in Keserwan's interior and away from the Turkmen-dominated coastal area likely contributed to a steady deterioration of ties between the Assafs and their fellow Turkmens. At the same time, it brought the Assafs closer to the Maronites who lived in the interior areas of Keserwan. Coiniciding to the Assafs' relocation to Ghazir, Hubaysh ibn Musa moved to the village from Yanouh. The Assaf and Hubaysh clans thereafter developed strong ties, with members of the latter serving as agents of the Assafs and becoming their chief intermediaries with the local Maronites.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{evaluation}} and measurement of human body dimensions are achieved by physical anthropometry. Cephalometery is {{a branch of}} anthropometry science in which the head and face anatomical dimensions are measured. This research was conducted {{in view of the}} importance of anthropometric indices of the face in forensic medicine, surgery, paediatrics and medical imaging. Methods: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was set up to determine and compare the face shapes in Fars and <b>Turkman</b> ethnic groups of 808 normal 17 - to 20 -year-old males and females in Gorgon, North Iran (Fars group 407, male 200 and female 207; <b>Turkman</b> group 401, male 198 and female 203). The length and width of faces were determined by using classic cephalometery technique with Martin spreading callipers, and the shape of faces in the ethnic group of Fars and <b>Turkman</b> in both sexes was compared. Results: The dominant type of face shape in both the native Fars and <b>Turkman</b> females was euryprosopic (37. 7 and 51. 7 percent, respectively). The dominant type of face shape in the native Fars and <b>Turkman</b> males was mesoprosopic (44 and 38. 4 percent, respectively).
