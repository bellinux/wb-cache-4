5|$|Batwoman {{appears as}} a member of an all-female team of heroes created by Wonder Woman to repel a faux-alien {{invasion}} of Washington DC masterminded by Professor Ivo. After the battle is over, Kate asks Wonder Woman if she'd like to accompany Kate and the other heroines to a bar in order to celebrate, but Wonder Woman politely turns <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> order to attend the college graduation ceremony of her old friend, Vanessa Kapatelis.|$|E
5|$|Adults who {{do believe}} that zero is even can {{nevertheless}} be unfamiliar with thinking of it as even, enough so to measurably slow <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a reaction time experiment. Stanislas Dehaene, {{a pioneer in the}} field of numerical cognition, led a series of such experiments in the early 1990s. A numeral or a number word is flashed to the subject on a monitor, and a computer records the time it takes the subject to push one of two buttons to identify the number as odd or even. The results showed that 0 was slower to process than other even numbers. Some variations of the experiment found delays as long as 60 milliseconds or about 10% of the average reaction time—a small difference but a significant one.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the player has to allocate a number of American troops in order to establish a beachhead on one of the six beaches of the island. However, many of the beaches are scattered with land mines and may provide an initial disadvantage to the assault. Throughout the game, the player may call in air strikes and other assaults, however they are only available after the American forces are attacked or if the enemy retreats to an inaccessible location. At any time in the game, the player is also able to request troop reinforcements from the fleet. Furthermore, Japanese air forces may sink American battleships throughout the game, although the player will {{be given the opportunity to}} shoot <b>them</b> <b>down.</b> <b>In</b> addition, a Japanese submarine will sink American gunboats at random intervals, and cannot be destroyed in any way. There is no save function in the game.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Invisible War, {{multiple}} {{attempts were made to}} create a third Deus Ex title, even after both Spector and Smith left Ion Storm. The two main projects were dubbed Deus Ex: Insurrection, which used the same engine as Invisible War while moving away from its divisive mechanics; and Deus Ex 3, which aimed to be an open world game with a branching narrative. Prospective development on the third Deus Ex game was halted when, following further staff departure and financial difficulties, the studio's owner Eidos Interactive closed <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> 2005. A separate project developed by Crystal Dynamics, intended as the fourth Deus Ex project following Insurrection and titled Des Ex: Clan Wars, was reworked as Project Snowblind. Invisible War was the last Deus Ex game developed by Ion Storm prior to its closure.|$|E
5|$|The year of 1967 started {{badly for}} the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF). During {{the early years}} of the war, the rules of {{engagement}} prevented U.S. fighter-bombers from hitting North Vietnamese air bases, and that allowed North Vietnamese fighter pilots to attack American bomber formations as they were approaching their targets, thereby forcing U.S. pilots to jettison their bomb loads before they even reached their target. Then, instead of dueling with U.S. strike aircraft, North Vietnamese pilots would normally retreat to the safety of their bases. To preempt further attacks on U.S. bomber formations by the North Vietnamese Air Force, the United States Air Force became interested in luring North Vietnamese MiG fighters up against a decoy target, and shoot <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the air using missile-armed fighter aircraft. By 1967, the North Vietnamese Air Force had become more aggressive towards U.S. strike formations, and it indicated to U.S. commanders that it was the right time to launch a decoy operation.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} documented Charvaka {{scholar in}} India is Ajita Kesakambali. Although materialist schools existed before Charvaka, {{it was the}} only school which systematised materialist philosophy by setting <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the form of aphorisms in the 6th century BC. There was a base text, a collection sūtras or aphorisms and several commentaries were written to explicate the aphorisms.|$|E

For example, in two cases Bax stated to {{have relied on}} one single local informant who told him improbable stories about public events that were not confirmed by anyone else. Bax did not check the stories and wrote <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> detail as if these they were historical facts. The commission that investigated Bax' research was unable to interview these two informants, so data fabrication by Bax could not be proven.|$|E
25|$|The {{striped hyena}} is {{primarily}} a scavenger, though it will occasionally attack and kill any defenseless animal it can overcome, and will supplement its diet with fruits. The spotted hyena, though it also scavenges occasionally, is an active pack hunter of medium to large sized ungulates, which it catches by wearing <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> long chases and dismembering them in a canid-like manner. The aardwolf {{is primarily a}}n insectivore, specialised for feeding on termites of the genus Trinervitermes and Hodotermes, which it consumes by licking them up with its long, broad tongue. An aardwolf can eat 300,000 Trinervitermes on a single outing.|$|E
25|$|There were secret {{staircases}} {{and hidden}} spaces which {{were used to}} overhear the discussions in the prison cells. The ceiling of the torture chamber was especially designed to muffle {{the cries of the}} victims. Inside the torture chamber, furnaces and grates were also present. Up to 1850 the chambers were shown to visitors after which time the ecclesiastical authorities of Avignon decided to shut <b>them</b> <b>down.</b> <b>In</b> a similar vein the torture chamber of the Spanish Inquisition in Lima, Peru had one metre thick walls so that the screams of the victims could not penetrate them.|$|E

25|$|Gloucestershire {{stayed in}} Northampton for the Twenty20 game, and lost again. Two home wins followed, though, over Glamorgan and Worcestershire, {{and they looked}} very solid after their initial setback - after two no-results and yet another win over Worcestershire had ensured that they had grabbed eight points from six games. However, their bowling let <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the last two games, first {{allowing}} whipping boys Glamorgan to take a thumping ten-wicket victory at Cardiff, and then handing Somerset the highest team score in Twenty20 Cup history, with 228 for 5 - which sent Somerset through and Gloucestershire out.|$|E
25|$|In 1594, the Compagnie van Verre ("Company of Far Lands") {{was founded}} in Amsterdam, {{with the aim of}} sending two fleets to the spice islands of Maluku. The first fleet sailed in 1596 and {{returned}} in 1597 with a cargo of pepper, which more than covered the costs of the voyage. The second voyage (1598–1599), returned its investors a 400% profit. The success of these voyages led to the founding of a number of companies competing for the trade. The competition was counterproductive to the companies' interests as it threatened to drive up the price of spices at their source in Indonesia whilst driving <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> Europe.|$|E
25|$|Devi {{travelled}} {{the world}} demonstrating her arithmetic talents, including {{a tour of}} Europe in 1950 and a performance in New York City in 1976. In 1988, she travelled to the US to have her abilities studied by Arthur Jensen, {{a professor of psychology}} at the University of California, Berkeley. Jensen tested her performance of several tasks, including the calculation of large numbers. Examples of the problems presented to Devi included calculating the cube root of 61,629,875 and the seventh root of 170,859,375. Jensen reported that Devi provided the solution to the above mentioned problems (395 and 15, respectively) before Jensen could copy <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> his notebook. Jensen published his findings in the academic journal Intelligence in 1990.|$|E

25|$|Some {{species of}} spider {{do not use}} webs for {{capturing}} prey directly, instead pouncing from concealment (e.g. trapdoor spiders) or running <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> open chase (e.g. wolf spiders). The net-casting spider balances the two methods of running and web spinning in its feeding habits. This spider weaves a small net which it attaches to its front legs. It then lurks in wait for potential prey and, when such prey arrives, lunges forward to wrap its victim in the net, bite and paralyze it. Hence, this spider expends less energy catching prey than a primitive hunter such as the wolf spider. It also avoids the energy loss of weaving a large orb web.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the South African Air Force {{had been}} {{supplied}} with some Battles. In August 1940, No. 11 Squadron took possession {{of at least}} four, which were flown north to be operated in the Italian East Africa (Ethiopia, Italian Somaliland and Eritrea) campaign. They conducted bombing and reconnaissance operations. Whereas in France the RAF's Battles had encountered modern German fighters in large numbers, the South Africans faced {{a smaller number of}} Italian biplane fighters (Fiat CR.32 and CR.42s), which enabled the aircrews to contribute more effectively to the campaign; but not without several losses, especially when surprised above some predictable targets (air bases, ports etc.), since Italian biplanes dived as fast as possible over the bombers, trying to shoot <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the first pass.|$|E
25|$|Planning for the sequel, {{eventually}} titled Beneath the Planet of the Apes, began {{two months}} after the original film's release. Jacobs and Abrahams initially considered several treatments by Rod Serling and Pierre Boulle, but ultimately turned <b>them</b> <b>down.</b> <b>In</b> fall 1968 the producers hired Paul Dehn to write the script; he would become the primary writer for the franchise. Charlton Heston was uninterested in a sequel, but agreed to shoot a few scenes if his character were killed off and his salary donated to charity. In one of many major rewrites, Dehn altered the script to center on a new character, Brent, played by James Franciscus. With director Franklin J. Shaffner unavailable, owing to his work on Patton, the producers hired Ted Post on January 8, 1969. Post struggled with the material, especially after the studio cut the budget to $3.4 million.|$|E
