50|$|Failure of the Jarring Mission and the {{mediated}} {{peace talks}} reflected a long-standing stalemate between Israel and Egypt. Whereas Israel demanded a formal recognition of its sovereignty, gained via direct {{peace talks with}} Egypt, Egypt would only agree to offer a peace sponsored by the third-party United Nations (this would allow Egypt to avoid political fallout from the Arab nations, which were strongly opposed to recognition of Israel). In addition to this peace, Israel would return all land to Egypt. Both parties viewed the conflicting interests as a stalemate only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>via</b> military intimidation. Whereas the US government view hoped to use promises of arms to gain Israeli concessions on land, Israel desired arms to secure the land it refused to give up.|$|E
50|$|During the {{presidency}} of revolutionary general Lázaro Cárdenas del Río, the controversy over petroleum again flared. Standard Oil had major investments in Mexico and a dispute between the oil workers and the company was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>via</b> the Mexican court system. The dispute, however, escalated, and on March 18, 1938, President Cárdenas used constitutional powers to expropriate foreign oil interests in Mexico and created the government-owned Petroleos Mexicanos or PEMEX. Although the United States had {{had a long history}} of interventions in Latin America, the expropriation did not result in that. U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was implementing the Good Neighbor Policy, in which the U.S. eschewed the role of intervention and courted better relations with the region, which would be vital if another major conflict broke out in Europe. However, with the Great Depression, the United States implemented a program of expelling Mexicans from the U.S. in what was known as Mexican Repatriation.When the U.S. did enter World War II, it negotiated an agreement with Mexican President Manuel Avila Camacho to be allies in the conflict against the Axis powers. The U.S. bought Mexican metals, especially copper and silver, but also importantly implemented a labor agreement with Mexico, known as the Bracero Program. Mexican agricultural workers were brought under contract to the U.S. to do mainly agricultural labor as well as harvesting timber in the northwest. The program continued in effect until 1964 when organized labor in the U.S. pushed for ending it.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: For {{cost-effective}} {{realization of}} sizable realtime distributed computing application systems, significant advances in resource allocation are in critical needs. An advanced practical scheme for high-level programming of real-time distributed computing software {{such as the}} TMO (Time-triggered Message-triggered Object) scheme introduces the potential for realizing new improved resource allocation approaches. The main reason is because it provides information-rich intuitively appealing timing specifications. However, to properly exploit the potential, {{a number of issues}} need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>via</b> extensive research involving both analytical and experimental efforts. A hierarchical resource allocation scheme that becomes enabled by use of the TMO programming model is discussed along with the remaining research issues.

50|$|Historically, {{this system}} caused some problems, {{especially}} in the {{years leading up to}} the Second Vatican Council. An example was the island-state of Singapore, where the Portuguese mission, under the Padroado, operated Saint Joseph's Church independently of the Roman Catholic Mission and later the Archdiocese of Singapore. This led to a situation of dual ecclesiastical administration. The situation had <b>to</b> eventually <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>via</b> a diplomatic settlement between the governments of Portugal and the Holy See. This was in line with the Second Vatican Council, in which the Holy See actively asked governments to give up and annul treaties or privileges similar to the Padroado. St. Joseph's Church eventually came under the administration of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore. Due to issues relating to parish culture and Portuguese missionary activity, however, the church was granted certain privileges and <b>to</b> this day <b>is</b> not officially considered a parish church.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{computational}} approach coupling the lattice-Boltzmann (LB) {{method and}} a Langevin-dynamics (LD) approach has <b>been</b> developed <b>to</b> simulate nanoscale suspensions {{in the presence}} of both thermal fluctuation and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (HI) with linear scalability. The dynamics of the suspended nanoscale particle/polymer (NPP) <b>are</b> <b>resolved</b> through the LD with the NPP Brownian motion explicitly driven by the stochastic force term. By introducing a discrete LB forcing source term, the LB method is coupled with the LD in a two-way fashion to directly include and resolve the many-body HI in the dilute regime. The validity and accuracy of this LB-LD approach are demonstrated through several verification problems, including velocity relaxation of an isolated particle, self-diffusion of a nanoparticle (NP) swarm, and relaxation of a single polymer chain. Good agreement between simulation and theory <b>is</b> observed. <b>To</b> ensure complete localization and linear scalability of the particle dynamics, an Eulerian host algorithm for efficient short-range pairwise particle search and interaction is introduced. Since the nanoscale suspension dynamics <b>are</b> intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fully <b>resolved</b> <b>via</b> sub-lattice techniques, this LB-LD approach can be favorably incorporated into complex multiscale computational frameworks for both biological and industrial multimodal suspension applications.

40|$|In the polyembryonic wasp Copidosoma floridanum, females {{commonly}} lay {{one male}} and one female egg in a lepidopteran host. Both sexes proliferate clonally within the growing host larva. Distinct larval castes develop from each wasp egg, the majority being ‘reproductives’ plus some ‘soldiers’ which sacrifice reproduction and attack competitors. Maturing mixed sex broods are usually female biased, as expected when intra-brood mating is common. Pre-mating dispersal followed by outbreeding <b>is</b> expected <b>to</b> increase sexual conflict over brood sex ratios {{and result in}} greater soldier attack rates. Owing to sexually asymmetric relatedness, intra-brood conflicts <b>are</b> expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> primarily <b>via</b> female soldier attack. We observed soldier behaviour in vitro to test whether lower intra-brood relatedness (siblings from either within-strain or between-strain crosses were presented) increased inter-sexual aggression by female as well as male soldiers. As found in prior studies, females were more aggressive than males but, contrary to expectations and previous empirical observations, soldiers of both sexes showed more aggression towards more closely related embryos. We speculate that lower intra-brood relatedness indicates maternal outbreeding and may suggest a rarity of mating opportunities for reproductives maturing from the current brood, which may enhance the value of opposite sex brood-mates, or that higher aggression towards relatives may be a side-effect of mechanisms to discriminate heterospecific competitors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract] The present paper {{looks at}} stress-shifting {{processes}} which transformed penultimate stress (pilgrimá:Ze, ‘pilgrimage’) into word-initial stress (pílgrima(:) Z) in Middle English. The change also involved final-vowel deletion. The {{contact between the}} ME stress system and that derived from French loans seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>via</b> regularisation {{in the direction of}} the borrowing language. However, we claim that this process of stress shifting already points towards changes in the English grammar of stress. We provide an Optimality Theory (Prince & Smolensky, 1993 / 2004; McCarthy & Prince, 1993) analysis of this phenomenon, suggesting that stress regularisation results from a conspiracy of both paradigmatic and grammatical forces. Not only does the resulting pattern (pílgrima(:) Z) comply with the wordinitial stress dominant pattern in OE and ME, but also it is less marked from a phonological viewpoint. This suggests an emerging grammatical role of the constraint NONFINALITY in ME grammar...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{statistical}} properties of magnification perturbations by substructures in strong lensed systems using linear perturbation theory and an analytical substructure model including tidal truncation and a continuous substructure mass spectrum. We demonstrate that magnification perturbations {{are dominated by}} perturbers found within a tidal radius of an image, and that sizable magnification perturbations may arise from small, coherent contributions from several substructures within the lens halo. We find that the root-mean-square (rms) fluctuation of the magnification perturbation is {approx} 10 % to {approx} 20 % and both the average and rms perturbations {{are sensitive to the}} mass spectrum and density profile of the perturbers. Interestingly,we find that relative to a smooth model of the same mass, the average magnification in clumpy models is lower (higher) than that in smooth models for positive (negative) parity images. This is opposite from what is observed if one assumes that the image magnification predicted by the best-fit smooth model of a lens is a good proxy for what the observed magnification would have been if substructures were absent. While it is possible for this discrepancy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>via</b> nonlinear perturbers, we argue that a more likely explanation is that the assumption that the best-fit lens model is a good proxy for the magnification in the absence of substructure is not correct. We conclude that a better theoretical understanding of the predicted statistical properties of magnification perturbations by CDM substructure is needed in order to affirm that CDM substructures have been unambiguously detected...|$|E

40|$|We study a {{model for}} lipid-bilayer {{membrane}} vesicles exhibiting phase separation, incorporating a phase field together with membrane fluidity and bending elasticity. We prove {{the existence of a}} plethora of equilibria in the large, corresponding to symmetry-breaking solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations, via global bifurcation from the spherical state. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first rigorous existence results for this class of problems. We overcome several difficulties in carrying this out. Due to inherent surface fluidity combined with finite curvature elasticity, neither the Eulerian (spatial) nor the Lagrangian (material) description of the model lends itself well <b>to</b> analysis. This <b>is</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>via</b> a singularity-free radial-map description, which effectively eliminates the grossly underdetermined in-plane deformation. The resulting governing equations comprise a quasi-linear elliptic system with nonlinear constraints. We show the equivalence of the problem to that of finding the zeros of compact vector field. The latter is not routine. Using spectral and a-priori estimates together with Fredholm properties, we demonstrate that the principal part of the quasi-linear mapping defines an operator with compact resolvent. We then combine well known group-theoretic ideas for symmetry breaking with global bifurcation theory to obtain our results.

40|$|Laser cooled ions in a Penning trap can be {{isolated}} from the environment by placing them in vacuum and only interacting with them through optical and RF fields. The number of trapped particles can be varied from a single ion up to thousands. Confinement is provided by a static homogeneous magnetic field and a quadrupole electric potential. In the natural frame of the ions, this appears as a 3 D simple harmonic potential. Therefore three dimensional structures can be formed {{in the absence of}} any additional RF field which may lead to heating as is the case with RF traps. There are 3 N different motional modes for N particles. I present an analysis of the motion of a single particle showing that the energy levels for all three modes are equally spaced. I also describe the interaction between a trapped two level atom and an optical field. During my time in the lab the laser and computer control of the experiment has been significantly improved. In addition, an existing trap was modified to provide greater optical access and fluorescence collection. This allowed the vibrational levels superimposed on the internal states of a single 40 Ca+ ion <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>via</b> a narrow linewidth, electric quadrupole transition. This is the first observation of magnetron and modified cyclotron sidebands on an optical transition. When more than one calcium ion is laser cooled, and their temperature reduced below 5 mK, they form a Coulomb crystal. The locations of the ions minimise the total potential energy which is comprised of the Coulomb repulsion and trap potential. The fluorescence collection optics have been arranged to resolve individual ions in these crystals. Information about the motion of the ions is deduced by comparing photos from the experiment to numerical simulations. Previously, only two ions have ever been aligned along the magnetic field in a Penning trap. I present strings of up to 29 particles and suggest the only limitation, apart from the electrode structure, is the overlap of the laser beams with the ions. Imperial Users onl...|$|E
