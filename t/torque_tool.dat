40|$|Objective: A new {{protocol}} was evaluated for identifi-cation of stiffness, mass, and damping parameters employ-ing a linear model for human hand-arm dynamics relevant to right-angle <b>torque</b> <b>tool</b> use. Background: Powered torque tools {{are widely used}} to tighten fasteners in manufacturing industries. While these tools increase accuracy and efficiency of tightening processes, operators are repetitively exposed to impulsive forces, posing risk of upper extremity musculoskeletal injury. Methods: A novel testing apparatus was developed that closely mimics biomechanical exposure in <b>torque</b> <b>tool</b> operation. Forty experienced <b>torque</b> <b>tool</b> operators were tested with the apparatus to determine model parameters and validate the protocol for physical capacity assessment. Results: A second-order hand-arm model with param-eters extracted in the time domain met model accuracy cri-terion of 5 % for time-to-peak displacement error in 93 % of trials (vs. 75 % for frequency domain). Average time-to-peak handle displacement and relative peak handle force errors were 0. 69 ms and 0. 21 %, respectively. Model parameters were significantly affected by gender and working posture. Conclusion: Protocol and numerical calculation procedures provide an alternative method for assessing mechanical parameters relevant to right-angle <b>torque</b> <b>tool</b> use. The protocol more closely resembles tool use, and calculation procedures demonstrate better performance of parameter extraction using time domain system identi-fication methods versus frequency domain. Application: Potential future applications include parameter identification for in situ <b>torque</b> <b>tool</b> operation and equipment development for human hand-arm dynamics simulation under impulsive forces {{that could be used}} for assessing torque tools based on factors relevant to opera-tor health (handle dynamics and hand-arm reaction force) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to design and test a {{mechanical}} DC <b>torque</b> <b>tool</b> testing rig that is capable of simulating dynamic response of the human arm under a torque impulse. The mechanical simulation of the human arm response is based on a nonlinear model derived from human subject testing. The testing rig, which uses both tension and compression springs to provide a bilinear stiffness rate to resist the motion of the <b>torque</b> <b>tool</b> handle, is used to analyze the tool handle angular displacement and reaction force, which has been strongly linked in previous studies to operator discomfort and injury. The mechanical simulation of the human arm response was tested under a number of different conditions, and compared to an analytical nonlinear model. The results showed that the mechanical simulation consistently underestimated the tool handle displacement by up to 16. 2 % when compared to the nonlinear model predictions. The discrepancy in handle displacement between the nonlinear model and mechanical simulation is likely due the coulomb friction not being included in the nonlinear model. Therefore, this study shows that by suing an offset to compensate for the coulomb friction, the tool testing rig can be used to accurately simulate the nonlinear dynamic response of the human arm under...|$|E

40|$|As per now, Oceaneering {{does not}} have a 38 000 Nm <b>torque</b> <b>tool</b> with torque {{feedback}} for subsea application. As one of Oceaneerings competitors delivers this type of tool with torque feedback within +/- 10 % accuracy, it is essential for Oceaneering to develop a functioning reliable tool with higher accuracy to be able to regain lost market share for these products. The objective of this thesis has been to develop an alternative concept to an already existing concept for torque feedback. Testing of an old 17 000 Nm <b>torque</b> <b>tool</b> with the existing concept revealed high deviation in accuracy (+/- 20 %) which is not acceptable. The condition of the strain gauges in the tool is unknown. Several concepts were evaluated during concept phase. The concept with the assumed highest accuracy was not chosen as it was estimated to be too expensive to develop and produce. The chosen concept was a new idea and no similar solutions were found during research. Both HBM and Scansense found the concept very exciting and interesting. Further, FEM analyses of the new concept and the existing concept were performed to determine the accuracy regarding strain distribution in the geometry. Due to the <b>torque</b> <b>tool</b> planetary gear system, the strain distribution changes with the position of the gear. For this reason, the torque feedback concept design has to be minimally affected by this effect. The target accuracy was set to +/- 5 % of read value. The results from the analyses of the existing concept revealed more accurate results than first anticipated based on the test results from the existing tool with torque feedback. The results showed a deviation of 0. 7 % between the gear simulated in position one and position two, and a deviation of 1. 7 % between the gear simulated in position two and position three. These results are within accuracy target and it is recommended to perform additional analyses in different positions and to further investigate the condition of the existing tool. The results from the analyses of the new concept are promising. The same positions as for the existing concept were analyzed and the accuracy was 0. 3 % for both positions. The theory the concept is based on adds up with the analyses results, and these results deliver a higher accuracy than the existing concept. Due to the low cost associated with investigating the existing tool and equip it with 8 - 10 strain gauges to achieve higher accuracy, this is recommended. Some technical challenges do exist regarding use of strain gauges for subsea application. However, Termo Tight does have experience with use of polypropylene for molding the strain gauges. As long as the strain gauges are exposed to hydrostatic pressure, these issues will be present independently of the concept. As a result of this thesis, two valid concepts have been investigated and issues regarding strain gauges for subsea use have been revealed. With this work as basis, Oceaneering will have a very good starting point for developing a functioning solution for a <b>torque</b> <b>tool</b> with torque feedback...|$|E

The system is useful for collecting high resolution end milling <b>torque</b> and <b>tool</b> temperature during cutting without interfering with the cutting process.

40|$|International audienceService level {{agreements}} (SLAs), or contracts, have {{an important}} role in web services. They define the obligations and rights between the provider of a web service and its client, about the function and the Quality of the service (QoS). For composite services like orchestrations, contracts are deduced by a process called QoS contract composition, based on contracts established between the orchestration and the called web services. Contracts are typically stated as hard guarantees (e. g., response time always less than 5 msec). Using hard bounds is not realistic, however, and more statistical approaches are needed. In this paper we propose using soft probabilistic contracts instead, which consist of a probability distribution for the considered QoS parameter [...] in this paper, we focus on timing.
