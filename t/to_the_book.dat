5|$|Aquino's Book of Coming Forth by Night makes {{reference}} <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> of the Law, {{a similarly}} 'revealed' text {{produced by the}} occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904 which {{provided the basis for}} Crowley's religion of Thelema. In Aquino's book, The Book of the Law was presented as a genuine spiritual text given to Crowley by preternatural sources, but it was also declared that Crowley had misunderstood both its origin and message. In making reference <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> of the Law, Aquino presented himself as being as much Crowley's heir as LaVey's, and Aquino's work would engage with Crowley's writings and beliefs to a far greater extent than LaVey ever did.|$|E
