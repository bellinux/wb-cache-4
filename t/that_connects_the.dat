5|$|The fold <b>that</b> <b>connects</b> <b>the</b> {{back of the}} sublingua {{and tongue}} to the rear floor of the mouth is called the plica sublingualis. In lemurs, this is an {{underdeveloped}} structure consisting of only a tiny outgrowth {{on the floor of}} the mouth. The point where the plica sublingualis attaches to the rear floor of the mouth marks the location of the submandibular salivary glands.|$|E

5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{may also}} play a {{secondary}} role in olfaction, which {{may account for the}} size reduction of the poorly studied upper incisors. The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions which are then spread through the fur. Furthermore, the size reduction of the upper incisors may create a gap between the teeth (interincisal diastema) <b>that</b> <b>connects</b> <b>the</b> philtrum (a cleft {{in the middle of the}} wet nose, or rhinarium) to the vomeronasal organ in the roof of the mouth. This would allow pheromones to be more easily transferred to the vomeronasal organ.|$|E
5|$|The Mariners' main supporters' {{group is}} known as the Yellow Army, for the colour of the club's home kit. The club shares a rivalry with Newcastle Jets, known as the F3 Derby, after the {{previous}} name of the motorway <b>that</b> <b>connects</b> <b>the</b> cities of the teams. Matt Simon is the Mariners' all-time leading goalscorer as of December 2014, with 45 goals in all competitions. The team record for matches played is held by John Hutchinson, who has appeared in 263 games for the Mariners.|$|E
5|$|The {{rapid transit}} station was {{designed}} by architects Jensen & Skodvin Architects, and is visually and structurally very similar to Storo. It features a center platform, a roof, and incorporates wood, steel and concrete as construction materials. To the south, the station is located just outside the tunnel <b>that</b> <b>connects</b> <b>the</b> Ring Line to the Grorud Line. To the north, the line runs parallel to the mainline Gjøvik Line.

5|$|Continuing {{down the}} line, the train passes the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad mine train roller coaster {{attraction}} and traverses a swing bridge, which crosses a canal <b>that</b> <b>connects</b> <b>the</b> Rivers of America to a boat servicing area. This bridge was originally located in Wabasso, Florida, and was previously {{owned by the}} Florida East Coast Railway. The train then runs through an area where numerous static and Audio-Animatronic displays of Native Americans and wild animals can be seen. After that, the train goes under an overpass, passes the spur line leading to the WDWRR's roundhouse where its trains are stored and maintained, and arrives at its next stop at Fantasyland Station.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, {{construction}} {{added another}} 368 {{seats in the}} north endzone and two observation decks. The $11million project also includes a significantly upgraded jumbotron with a new sound system, a Spanish Renaissance-themed colonnade, and a north end zone concourse <b>that</b> <b>connects</b> <b>the</b> two stadium halves. Along with the other additions, 157feet of ribbon board will be added on the north end zone, more than 160 linear feet {{in the northeast and}} northwest corners of the stadium, and 94 lineal feet in the south end zone over the athletic offices. The construction was completed during the 2013 season. The stadium's capacity is 60,862, making it the third-largest on-campus stadium in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{southern}} end of Tucana, the Small Magellanic Cloud is a dwarf galaxy that is one of the nearest neighbors to the Milky Way galaxy at a distance of 210,000 light-years. Though it probably formed as a disk shape, tidal forces from the Milky Way have distorted it. Along with the Large Magellanic Cloud, it lies within the Magellanic Stream, a cloud of gas <b>that</b> <b>connects</b> <b>the</b> two galaxies. NGC 346 is a star-forming region located in the Small Magellanic Cloud. It has an apparent magnitude of 10.3. Within it lies the triple star system HD 5980, each of its members among the most luminous stars known.|$|E

5|$|Meier also {{designed}} three other buildings located {{next to the}} north promontory and offset at a 22.5 degree angle from the main axis of the Museum pavilions. The north-most building is an auditorium. Next to it is the North Building, with the East Building sitting between the North Building and the rotunda. The main entrance to the East Building is flanked by two round silos that hold its elevators. A bridge over a sunken courtyard links the main entrance of the East Building to the main walkway <b>that</b> <b>connects</b> <b>the</b> auditorium and North Buildings to the rotunda. These buildings house the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI), the J. Paul Getty Trust and the Getty Foundation. These buildings are generally {{closed to the public}} except for special events held in the auditorium. They are linked to the Museum both by landscaped terraces and by an enclosed glass walkway that leads from the main rotunda.|$|E
5|$|On the interior, Strickland {{placed the}} grand {{staircase}} <b>that</b> <b>connects</b> <b>the</b> three levels immediately behind the portico {{in the central}} core of the structure. The floor system is composed of fired-clay jack arches supported on steel I-beams, a common feature of warehouses and other long-span structures. On the second floor, many of the larger rooms, which were used for coining and melting, contain ceilings with beautiful high arches supported by the walls and freestanding piers. The smaller rectangular rooms on the second level (and the basement), such as the former superintendent's office, also contain these arched ceilings with a single groin vault. The basement formerly contained the boilers inside a brick cage, but now contain museum exhibits devoted to the minting processes {{as well as the}} Coin Vault at the Mint, a coin shop.|$|E
5|$|The Grorud and Furuset Line head {{northeast}} into Groruddalen, {{while the}} other two eastern branches head south into Nordstrand. On the west side, the Holmenkoll and Sognsvann Line cover the northern boroughs of Oslo, along with the Ring Line <b>that</b> <b>connects</b> <b>the</b> northeastern and northwestern parts of town. The Kolsås and Røa Line reach deep into the neighbouring municipality of Bærum. All the lines run through the Common Tunnel before reaching out to different lines, or into the Ring. All lines have a base service of four trains per hour while line 2 and the eastern section of line 3 have eight trains per hour weekdays 7–19. The eastern section of line 2 also has eight trains per hour Saturdays 10–19. A reduced half-hourly service operates on all lines during early weekend mornings. Trains run from about 05:00 (06:00 at weekends) to 01:00 the next morning.|$|E

5|$|The body cavity {{contains}} the circulatory or haemal system. The vessels form three rings: one around the mouth (the hyponeural haemal ring), another around the digestive system (the gastric ring) {{and the third}} near the aboral surface (the genital ring). The heart beats about six times a minute and is {{at the apex of}} a vertical channel (the axial vessel) <b>that</b> <b>connects</b> <b>the</b> three rings. At the base of each arm are paired gonads; a lateral vessel extends from the genital ring past the gonads to the tip of the arm. This vessel has a blind end and there is no continuous circulation of the fluid within it. This liquid does not contain a pigment and has little or no respiratory function but is probably used to transport nutrients around the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{first part}} of Planescape: Torment takes place in Sigil, a city located atop an {{infinitely}} tall spire {{at the center of}} the multiverse, <b>that</b> <b>connects</b> <b>the</b> planes with each other via a series of portals. The city is overseen by the powerful Lady of Pain, while fifteen factions control different functions of the city related to each group's world view. Every faction strives for further control of the city. The Nameless One can even join several of these factions during the game. The story eventually moves on to other planes, such as Baator and Carceri, where The Nameless One continues to discover more about his past.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Kameo {{advances}} through a castle—with {{the help of}} three elemental powers—to rescue her family. As the tutorial prologue ends, Kameo loses her elemental powers and is ejected from the castle into the Enchanted Kingdom to grow stronger and try again. Kameo travels through four themed worlds (water, ice, fire, and swamp) at {{the outskirts of the}} Badlands, the overworld <b>that</b> <b>connects</b> <b>the</b> areas. Each of the worlds are interspersed with townsfolk and combat-oriented puzzles. Kameo can either travel to the worlds through the Badlands, where the elves and trolls skirmish, or warp from the Enchanted Kingdom. A help system built into the game provides hints or direct solutions for struggling players. Throughout the kingdom, Kameo finds and defeats the seven shadow creatures each guarding one of her elemental powers, while saving her family earning the other 3.|$|E
