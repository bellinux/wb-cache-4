40|$|ABSTRACT Mechanically deboned {{turkey meat}} (MDTM) was <b>texturized</b> by pan frying on a stove or by {{extrusion}} through a grinder plate followed by heat denaturation in an oven. Appropri-ate particle size (ca. 5 mm) of the <b>texturized</b> MDTM was attained by chopping prior to incor-porating it into summer sausages. Up to 30 % <b>texturized</b> MDTM could {{be incorporated into}} turkey summer sausages without appreciably affecting sausage composition. Increasing levels of <b>texturized</b> MDTM (10 to 40 %) in sausages slightly increased shear press values (nonsignificant); the sensory panel found no dif-ference in firmness. Appearance, juiciness, and acceptability of sausages decreased {{with high levels of}} <b>texturized</b> MDTM. Even though the texturization process created a particulate-like appearance in the sausages, texturization by the methods reported here is not recommended because the sensory panel assigned better scores to the MDTM sausages made with no <b>texturized</b> meat and the ground beef sausages.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Processamento de Alimentos - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe aim of {{this study}} was the {{analysis}} of volatile compounds responsible for the flavour of a <b>texturized</b> mango product, namely terpenes, lactones, aldehydes and alcohols, evaluating the impact of the processing applied: thermal treatment to inactivate enzymes, texturization with gellan gum, application of an edible coating and two conservation processes. The analytical method used was gas chromatography combined with the technique of solid phase microextraction. The product under development consists in a bar of mango puree <b>texturized</b> using the hydrocolloid gellan gum, matching 1 % of the weight of the mango puree. This percentage is composed by gellan low and high acyl, with the ratio 25 / 75, respectively. The product also has an edible coating, comprised by 1 % of gellan gum which is formed with a 90 / 10 low acyl/high acyl ratio. The thermal treatment to inactivate enzymes of mango puree caused a decrease of most volatile compounds. The <b>texturized</b> mango puree has exhibited an ability to release the volatiles, similar to mango puree.

However, {{there is no}} evidence determining whether this staining is increased on <b>texturized</b> surfaces or if the color change is superficial and can be removed by repolishing procedures. Objective:  To evaluate the effect of tobacco smoke on the color of a composite with smooth or <b>texturized</b> surfaces, before and after repolishing. Materials and Methods:  Forty composite specimens were allocated into four groups (N = 10) : Smooth surface not exposed (G 1) and exposed to tobacco smoke (G 2), <b>texturized</b> surface not exposed (G 3), and exposed to tobacco smoke (G 4). During 21 days, G 2 and G 4 were daily exposed to the smoke from 20 cigarettes. Color measurements were carried out at baseline, after 21 days, and after repolishing. Variables L* (luminosity), b* (blue-yellow), and ΔE (total color change) were statistically analyzed (repeated measures analysis of variance/Tukey). Results:  <b>Texturized</b> and smooth specimens presented similar luminosity at baseline. Tobacco smoke significantly reduced L* in G 2 and G 4, and increased b* in G 4. After repolishing, L* increased and b* reduced in stained groups, but values continued to be different from baseline ones. Repolishing significantly reduced ΔE, but values from stained groups were still greater than that from unstained groups. Conclusion:  Tobacco smoke changes the color of composite, and surface texture can increase the staining. Repolishing reduces superficial staining, but this procedure may not return the composite to baseline color...|$|R

Effect of addition of <b>texturizing</b> inulin (Frutafit TEX) at levels 2 and 4 % (w ⁄w) on physicochemical properties, yield, textural, microstructure, microbiological counts and sensory characteristics were investigated. The results revealed that the addition of <b>texturizing</b> inulin increased yield values and moisture content of Karish cheeses compared with control. Protein and ash content were not influenced significantly {{as compared to the}} control of storage at 4 0 C as a result of texturized inulin addition. Differences in the microstructure of Karish cheese with inulin and control reflected the differences in its inulin content. Hardness decreased from 495 (g) in control to 216 and 143 in Karish cheese made with 2 and 4 % texturized inulin at zero time of storage at 4 ◦C as a result of texturized inulin addition respectively. Results obtained by the panelists revealed that Karish cheese prepared in the presence of 4 % inulin gave the highest texture and acceptability score compared to panel Karish cheese (control) and stored cheeses.
