5|$|The CSR {{subsidies}} {{are paid to}} insurance companies to reduce copayments and deductibles for a smaller group of ACA enrollees, those earning less than 250% of the federal poverty line (FPL). The second and larger <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidy,</b> the premium tax credits designed to reduce the post-subsidy cost of monthly premiums, apply to all enrollees earning less than 400% of the FPL. For scale, during 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies will be paid, versus $34 billion for the premium tax credits. A court decision meant that CSR subsidies were treated as discretionary spending, meaning Congress must decide to appropriate funds for them each year. This effectively gave the President the power to end them, as Democrats with a minority in Congress could not appropriate the funds, let alone override his veto of an appropriations bill.|$|E

In other words, the after-subsidy cost would not rise for those with premium tax credit subsidies. Those obtaining their insurance via the exchanges without subsidies would pay up to 20 percentage points more for insurance.

40|$|From the introduction]. Increasing {{mobility}} of capital pressures governments {{around the world}} to remain attractive locations for investment. In order to attract new firms or to maintain existing ones, governments at national and subnational levels offer various forms <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> to firms including direct grants, tax breaks, worker training credits and free land. Competition to attract footloose capital creates similar pressures for governments around the world, resulting in subsidy races that lead governments to bid against one another with growing subsidy packages. There is considerable variation, however, in the level and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> governments offer. Among European countries which are similarly situated in the global economy, for instance, Austria and the Netherlands provide subsidies for research and development, Portugal, France and Ireland focus on aiding specific manufacturing sectors, and Belgium and Italy stress regional assistance.

40|$|Public goods can {{be financed}} by direct {{taxation}} or a subsidy to private spending. This paper examines the relative efficiency and distributional {{consequences of the}} two methods. Efficiency is shown {{to depend on the}} price elasticity of private spending and the trade- off between public and private spending. When this trade-off is dollar for dollar, however, a subsidy is always more efficient than direct taxation. The gains from a subsidy are larger for a mixed good than for a pure public good. Looking a t distributional effects, the author shows when richer taxpayers may prefer a tax credit to deductibility, even though they face lower prices with deductibility, and also shows when richer taxpayers prefer direct taxation to either <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidy.</b> Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|E
