5|$|In past Zelda titles, {{the team}} had made {{numerous}} new fields for player exploration, but this time they limited the number of overworlds to three and expanded their content so players {{would be able to}} full appreciate them through repeated visits. The team also created the world based on their experiences with Twilight Princess: feeling that the overworld and dungeons were too large with puzzles too thinly dispersed, the team both sought to compact areas and have environmental puzzles in the overworld. The biggest difficulty was ensuring that players could reach areas quickly while still discovering new features and puzzles. The creation of the Skyloft overworld was due to difficulties connecting the three Surface-based overworlds with each other due to drastically contrasting environments. The sky was initially going to be presented similar to the course selection screen from the Super Mario series, but this was changed to an overworld with its own quests and population so Link had a place where he could prepare for his adventures. An initial idea, when jumping down from the sky seemed unlikely to be approved, was to have a huge tower acting as a central hub, with the height at which Link jumped lengthening the duration of his free fall. Once the concept of traveling from <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>had</b> been chosen instead, the Loftwing mounts were created so it looked and felt more rational to players. These overlapping gameplay mechanics triggered the creation of Skyloft, along with elements of the early game such as the Knight Academy. The continual movements and routines of Skyloft's people were modeled after similar time-driven mechanics from , with similar links between character-specific side quests and the main narrative. Despite the aerial element, the mechanics necessary for free navigation meant a Loftwing racing minigame could not be implemented.|$|E
25|$|The {{point is}} that the idea of space {{vehicles}} shaped like flying saucers was imprinted in the national psyche for many years prior to 1947, when the Roswell incident took place. It didn't take much stretching for the first observers of UFOs to assume that the unknown objects hovering in <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>had</b> the same disk shape as the science fictional vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The Aztec world {{consisted}} of three main parts: the earth world on which humans lived (including Tamoanchan, the mythical origin of human beings), an underworld which belonged to the dead (called Mictlan ("place of death")), and the upper plane in the sky. The earth and the underworld were both open for humans to enter, whereas the upper plane in the sky was impenetrable to humans. Existence was envisioned as straddling the two worlds in a cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth. Thus {{as the sun was}} believed to dwell in the underworld at night to rise reborn in the morning and maize kernels were interred to later sprout anew, so the human and divine existence was also envisioned as being cyclical. The upper and nether worlds were both thought to be layered. Mictlan had nine layers which were inhabited by different deities and mythical beings. <b>The</b> <b>sky</b> <b>had</b> thirteen layers, the highest of which was called Omeyocan ("place of duality") and served as the residence of the progenitor dual god Ometeotl. The lowest layer of the sky was a verdant spring-like place with abundant water called Tlalocan ("the place of Tlaloc").|$|E

500|$|In October 2005 a {{group of}} {{students}} from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology carried out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30cm) square mirror tiles, focused on a [...] wooden ship at a range of around 100feet (30m). Flames broke out on a patch of the ship, but only after <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>had</b> been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show MythBusters, using a wooden fishing boat in San Francisco as the target. Again some charring occurred, along {{with a small amount of}} flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its autoignition temperature, which is around 300°C (570°F).|$|E
500|$|The {{magazine}} was {{originally intended to}} be a vehicle for reprinting novels. [...] The title and format were an echo of Two Complete Detective Books Magazine, which had been published, also by Fiction House, in the 1930s. [...] The first issue included Isaac Asimov's Pebble in the Sky, and L. Ron Hubbard's [...] "The Kingslayer". [...] Both of these were reprints: Pebble in <b>the</b> <b>Sky</b> <b>had</b> been published by Doubleday earlier in the year, and [...] "The Kingslayer" [...] had appeared in Hubbard's short story collection The Kingslayer, published by Fantasy Publishing Company, Inc., in 1949. [...] Subsequent issues abandoned the policy of reprinting two novels, and for a while each issue featured one original story and one reprint. [...] In some later issues both stories were original.|$|E

By [...] the attacking troops had reached their jumping-off positions unnoticed, except for some in the II Anzac Corps area. Routine British artillery night firing stopped around half an hour before dawn and birdsong could be heard. At [...] the mines began to detonate. After the explosions, the British artillery began to fire at maximum rate. A creeping barrage in three belts [...] deep began and counter-battery groups bombarded all known German artillery positions with gas shell. The nine attacking divisions and the three in reserve began their advance as the German artillery reply came scattered and late, falling on British assembly trenches after they had been vacated.|$|E

500|$|The {{panels are}} in {{relatively}} good condition given their age. The Philadelphia version is better preserved; it has superior tonalities and more prominent colours. [...] In 1906, Roger Fry {{gave it a}} well-documented restoration with overpaint removed. Fry {{was at the time}} Curator of Paintings at the Metropolitan Museum and performed restorations despite a formal lack of training; the St Francis was the second restoration he undertook. He attributed the work to Hubert van Eyck, and thought the Turin version a copy. His removal of a section at the top revealed a red border; he wrote that van Eyck had [...] "conceived it as a miniature in oil on panel, and that it might indicate a date not very far removed from the drawings of the Turin Book of Hours" [...] (Milan-Turin Hours). In 1926 he recorded: [...] "When it came to me, the panel was considerably larger at the top, and dull opaque sky concealed the join where the extra piece had been added on to satisfy some owner who did not appreciate the compressed composition [...] of the original. <b>The</b> <b>sky</b> <b>had</b> been enlivened... with a crowd of small white-cloud like forms suggesting the presence of a cohort of angels."
