5|$|Silicon carbide is a {{semiconductor}} {{in research}} and early mass production providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were Schottky diodes, followed by junction-gate FETs and MOSFETs for high-power switching. Bipolar transistors and <b>thyristors</b> are currently developed. A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations. As a result, devices made of SiC crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance. Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of SiC with silicon dioxide have hampered the development of SiC-based power MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar transistors. Although the mechanism is still unclear, nitridation has dramatically reduced the defects causing the interface problems. In 2008, the first commercial JFETs rated at 1200 V {{were introduced to the}} market, followed in 2011 by the first commercial MOSFETs rated at 1200 V. Beside SiC switches and SiC Schottky diodes (also Schottky barrier diode, SBD) in the popular TO-247 and TO-220 packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their power electronic modules. SiC SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in PFC circuits and IGBT power modules.|$|E

Gate turn-off <b>thyristors</b> are used to produce alternating current from a DC supply, for example on the Eurostar Trains to power the three-phase traction motors.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, works on {{thyristor}} circuits were carried at Bell Labs, IBM and RCA. Ian Munro Ross and David D'Azaro (Bell Labs) experimented with thyristor-based memory cells. Joe Logue and Rick Dill (IBM) were building counters using monojunction transistors. Torkel Wallmark and Harwick Johnson (RCA) used both the <b>thyristors</b> and field-effect transistors. The works of 1955–1958 that used germanium <b>thyristors</b> were fruitless. Only {{in the summer}} of 1959, after the inventions of Kilby, Lehovec and Hoerni became publicly known, D'Azaro reported an operational shift register based on silicon <b>thyristors.</b> In this register, one crystal containing four <b>thyristors</b> replaced eight transistors, 26 diodes and 27 resistors. The area of each thyristor ranged from 0.2 to 0.4mm2, with a thickness of about 0.1mm. The circuit elements were isolated by etching deep grooves.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Electricity market {{activities}} {{and a growing}} demand for electricity have led to heavily stressed power systems. This requires operation of the networks closer to their stability limits. Cost effective solutions are preferred over network extensions. The flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS), a new technology based on power electronics, offers an opportunity to enhance controllability, stability, and power transfer capability of ac transmission systems. This paper provides a comprehensive review and evaluation of FACTS controllers.

40|$|The {{converter}} valve is {{the core}} equipment in the HVDC power transmission system, a+-nd its performance has a direct effect on the reliability, stability and efficiency of the whole power system. As the basic unit of HVDC converter valve, the <b>thyristor</b> level needs to be test routinely in order to grasp {{the state of the}} converter valve equipment. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a novel synthetic test system for the <b>thyristor</b> level with <b>thyristor</b> control unit (TCU). However, currently there is no specific test scheme for the <b>thyristor</b> level of HVDC converter valve. In this paper, the synthetic test principle, content and methods for the <b>thyristor</b> level with TCU are presented based on the analysis of the <b>thyristor</b> reverse recovery characteristic and the IEC technology standard. And a transient high-voltage pulse is applied to the <b>thyristor</b> level during its reverse recovery period in order to test the characteristics of <b>thyristor</b> level. Then, the synthetic test system for the <b>thyristor</b> level is applied to the converter valve test of ± 800 kV HVDC power transmission project, and the practical test result verifies the reasonability and validity of the proposed synthetic test system...|$|R

25|$|Since modern <b>{{thyristor}}s</b> {{can switch}} {{power on the}} scale of megawatts, thyristor valves have become the heart of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) conversion either to or from alternating current. In the realm of this and other very high-power applications, both electrically triggered (ETT) and light-triggered (LTT) <b>thyristors</b> are still the primary choice. The valves are arranged in stacks usually suspended from the ceiling of a transmission building called a valve hall. <b>Thyristors</b> are arranged into a diode bridge circuit and to reduce harmonics are connected in series to form a 12-pulse converter. Each thyristor is cooled with deionized water, and the entire arrangement becomes one of multiple identical modules forming a layer in a multilayer valve stack called a quadruple valve. Three such stacks are typically mounted on the floor or hung from the ceiling of the valve hall of a long-distance transmission facility.|$|E

25|$|In {{high-power}} applications, from 1975 to 2000, most mercury valve arc-rectifiers {{were replaced}} by stacks of very high power <b>thyristors,</b> silicon devices with two extra layers of semiconductor, in comparison to a simple diode.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>thyristors</b> {{are heavily}} used in megawatt-scale {{rectification}} of AC to DC, in low- and medium-power (from few tens of watts to few tens of kilowatts) applications they have virtually {{been replaced by}} other devices with superior switching characteristics like Power MOSFETs or IGBTs. One major problem associated with SCRs {{is that they are}} not fully controllable switches. The GTO thyristor and IGCT are two devices related to the thyristor that address this problem. In high-frequency applications, <b>thyristors</b> are poor candidates due to long switching times arising from bipolar conduction. MOSFETs, on the other hand, have much faster switching capability because of their unipolar conduction (only majority carriers carry the current).|$|E
25|$|<b>Thyristors</b> {{have been}} used for decades as {{lighting}} dimmers, in television, motion pictures, and theater, where they replaced inferior technologies such as autotransformers and rheostats. They have also been used in photography as a critical part of flashes (strobes).|$|E

50|$|The {{integrated}} gate-commutated <b>thyristor</b> (IGCT) is a {{power semiconductor}} electronic device, used for switching electric current in industrial equipment. It {{is related to the}} gate turn-off (GTO) <b>thyristor.</b> It was jointly developed by Mitsubishi and ABB. Like the GTO <b>thyristor,</b> the IGCT is a fully controllable power switch, meaning that it can be turned both on and off by its control terminal (the gate). Gate drive electronics are integrated with the <b>thyristor</b> device.|$|R
25|$|In medium-power {{transmission}} applications, {{even more}} complex and sophisticated voltage sourced converter (VSC) silicon semiconductor rectifier systems, such as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT) and gate turn-off <b>thyristors</b> (GTO), have made smaller high voltage DC power transmission systems economical. All of these devices function as rectifiers.|$|E
25|$|Rectifiers supply polarised voltage for welding. In such {{circuits}} {{control of}} the output current is required; this is sometimes achieved by replacing some of the diodes in a bridge rectifier with <b>thyristors,</b> effectively diodes whose voltage output can be regulated by switching on and off with phase fired controllers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} world, silicon diodes {{are the most}} widely used {{rectifiers}} for lower voltages and powers, and have largely replaced earlier germanium diodes. For very high voltages and powers, the added need for controllability has in practice led to replacing simple silicon diodes with high-power <b>thyristors</b> (see below) and their newer actively gate-controlled cousins.|$|E

25|$|Other {{devices that}} have control {{electrodes}} {{as well as}} acting as unidirectional current valves are used where more than simple rectification is required—e.g., where variable output voltage is needed. High-power rectifiers, such as those used in high-voltage direct current power transmission, employ silicon semiconductor devices of various types.
