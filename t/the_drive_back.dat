5|$|Drives which encrypt all {{writes on}} the fly can {{implement}} ATA Secure Erase in another way. They simply zeroize and generate a new random encryption key each time a secure erase is done. In this way the old data cannot be read anymore, as it cannot be decrypted. Some drives with an integrated encryption may require a TRIM command {{be sent to the}} drive to put <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> to its original out-of-box state.|$|E
5|$|At the mall, Michael {{opens to}} the women about his {{discomfort}} with Jan. Among other things, he tells them Jan has been videotaping them having sex and watching it with him afterwards. All the women assure Michael that Jan's behavior is not normal and urge {{him to get out}} of the relationship. He remains conflicted about what he should do about Jan, but at Phyllis's prompting he finally admits to himself that he wants to break up with her. Michael thanks them for their help by treating them to one item each at Victoria's Secret. On <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>back,</b> Pam takes a step toward asserting herself by changing a flat tire on Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) car. At the office, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) sneaks in{{to the women}}'s bathroom and discovers a plush waiting room. The other men soon join him.|$|E
5|$|The ATA Secure Erase {{command is}} {{designed}} to remove all user data from a drive. With an SSD without integrated encryption, this command will put <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> to its original out-of-box state. This will initially restore its performance to the highest possible level and the best (lowest number) possible write amplification, {{but as soon as}} the drive starts garbage collecting again the performance and write amplification will start returning to the former levels. Many tools use the ATA Secure Erase command to reset the drive and provide a user interface as well. One free tool that is commonly referenced in the industry is called HDDErase. Gparted and Ubuntu live CDs provide a bootable Linux system of disk utilities including secure erase.|$|E

5|$|During a {{visit to}} a {{division}} command post on 24 August 1944 Strachwitz was badly injured in an automobile accident. The vehicle rolled over and the other occupants were killed. He sustained a fractured skull, and broken ribs, legs, arms and hands, and he was in critical condition. He was immediately taken to a field hospital, before being transferred to a hospital at Riga. He was then flown to Breslau in a Junkers Ju 52 for further treatment, where he was visited by his son, Harti. The doctors informed him that it would take him eight months to recover fully. Refusing to accept this, he worked out his own rehabilitation plan, and after seven days, Strachwitz signed himself out of the hospital, officially having himself transferred to the hospital at Oppeln. On <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> he lost consciousness at almost every turn, arriving at his manor in Alt Siedel on 28 November 1944. Here he convalesced until 23 December 1944.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Lenny and Amanda {{have been}} {{drifting}} apart, due to Lenny's obsession with Linda, but also Amanda's career and her {{affair with her}} colleague Jerry (Peter Weller). Amanda tells Lenny she wants to explore her relationship with Jerry. Lenny and Linda console each other over their break-ups, and end up finally engaging in intercourse. However, the next day Lenny reconciles with Amanda, and they {{realize that they are}} still in love. Linda tries unsuccessfully to get back with Kevin but on <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> to Manhattan, she sees a helicopter dropping out of the sky. She pulls over and gives the pilot, Don, a ride. It is revealed by the Greek chorus that they will end up married, although Linda is now pregnant with Lenny's child.|$|E
25|$|Patterson {{lost his}} title to Liston on September 25, 1962 in Chicago, by a first-round {{knockout}} {{in front of}} 18,894 fans. The two fighters were a marked contrast. In the ring, Liston's size and power proved too much for Patterson's guile and agility. However, Patterson did not use his speed to his benefit. According to Sports Illustrated writer Gilbert Rogin, Patterson didn't punch enough and frequently tried to clinch with Liston. Liston battered Patterson with body shots and then shortened up and connected with two double hooks high on the head. The result {{at the time was}} the third-fastest knockout in boxing history. After being knocked out, Patterson left Comiskey Park in Chicago wearing dark glasses and a fake beard for <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> to New York. After the fight, questions were raised on whether the fight was fixed to set up a more lucrative rematch. Overnight, Patterson seemed to lose his public support {{as a result of his}} swift knockout.|$|E

With the help of Nicole Walker, Marlena is able to find a flash drive in Kristen's possession that could reveal her crimes. Kristen finds out, though, and has thugs beat Marlena up to get <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>back.</b> She's unsuccessful, and Marlena is later able to recover it. The drive is encrypted, though, and she asks for the help of Victor Kiriakis to decode it. He's able to open the drive, and tells her that it's proof Kristen slept with another man. He convinces Marlena to play it at Brady and Kristen's wedding ceremony. Marlena discovers, though, {{along with the rest of}} the congregation, that the man in the video is her son Eric, who was drugged and raped by Kristen as revenge against Marlena. Marlena had to try and repair her relationship with both Brady and Eric. Marlena got caught up in the drama surrounding her children's lives, as Eric decided to leave his priesthood and pursue a relationship with Nicole, and Sami was accused of murder.|$|E
500|$|The Scranton {{branch of}} Dunder Mifflin is thrown into damage control mode when reams {{of paper with}} an obscene {{watermark}} depicting a cartoon duck and mouse having sex are shipped to customers. Michael Scott (Steve Carell) holds an emergency meeting in which he rebukes Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton)—the branch's quality assurance director—for failing to catch the error, tells Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) to train the accountants to handle customer support calls, and sends Jim and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) to a school that used the affected paper to print prom invitations. At the school, Andy is horrified to discover that his girlfriend is a student there, and is despondent throughout the visit. On <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>back,</b> Jim cheers him up by initiating an a capella performance of [...] "The Lion Sleeps Tonight".|$|E
500|$|On 24 October Newton, now {{driving a}} Ford saloon, met Scott by {{arrangement}} in Combe Martin, {{just north of}} Barnstaple. Newton explained {{that he had to}} drive to Porlock, about 25 miles away, and suggested that Scott accompany him—he and Scott could talk on the journey. Scott had with him his recently acquired pet dog, a Great Dane called Rinka; this disconcerted Newton, who was afraid of dogs, but Scott insisted that Rinka go with them. At Porlock, Newton left Scott and Rinka at a hotel while he supposedly dealt with his business. He picked them up shortly after 8pm, and they began <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> to Combe Martin. On a deserted stretch of road, Newton began to drive erratically, feigning tiredness, and accepted Scott's suggestion that he take over the driving. They stopped; Scott got out, followed by Rinka, and ran round to the driver's side, where he found Newton, gun in hand. Newton shot the dog in the head and, saying [...] "It's your turn now", pointed the gun at Scott. The pistol failed to fire several times; eventually Newton jumped into the car and drove away, leaving Scott and the dead or dying dog by the roadside.|$|E

2500|$|On <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> to Portsea, Holt {{suggested}} that the group stop at Cheviot Beach for a swim – it was about 12:15 p.m., {{and he wanted to}} cool down and work up an appetite before lunch. He knew the area well and had swum there many times before, in 1960 even salvaging a porthole from the SS Cheviot, the shipwreck that had given the beach its name. Holt did not hesitate in entering the water, despite a large swell and visible currents and eddies. Alan Stewart was the only other swimmer, as the others considered it unsafe. Stewart stayed close to shore, and even in the shallows felt a strong undertow. However, Holt swam into deeper water and was dragged out to sea. The others called out to him, but he did not raise his arms or cry for help. He soon slipped under the waves and out of sight, in a manner which Marjorie Gillespie described as [...] "like a leaf being taken out [...] so quick and final".|$|E
2500|$|The Wisden Cricketer {{reports that}} the Bullingdon is [...] "ostensibly {{one of the two}} {{original}} Oxford University cricket teams but it actually used cricket merely as a respectable front for the mischievous, destructive or self-indulgent tendencies of its members". By the late 19th century, the present emphasis on dining within the Club began to emerge. Long attested that in 1875 [...] "Bullingdon Club [...] matches were also of frequent occurrence, and many a good game was played there with visiting clubs. The Bullingdon Club dinners were the occasion of a great display of exuberant spirits, accompanied by a considerable consumption of the good things of life, which often made <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> to Oxford an experience of exceptional nature". A report of 1876 relates that [...] "cricket there was secondary to the dinners, and the men were chiefly of an expensive class". The New York Times told its readers in 1913 that [...] "The Bullingdon represents the acme of exclusiveness at Oxford; it is the club of the sons of nobility, the sons of great wealth; its membership represents the 'young bloods' of the university".|$|E
2500|$|After basic training, Maclean {{was sent}} to Cairo, where David Stirling invited him to join the newly formed Special Air Service (SAS), which he did. [...] They {{worked closely with the}} Long Range Desert Group (LRDG), a {{mechanised}} reconnaissance unit, to travel far behind enemy lines and attack targets such as aerodromes. [...] Maclean's first operation with the SAS, once his training was completed, was to Benghazi, Libya's second largest city, in late May 1942. He was joined on this operation by Randolph Churchill, son of the prime minister. [...] They drove from Alexandria via the seaport of Mersa Matruh and the inland Siwa Oasis. They crossed the ancient caravan route known as the Trigh-el-Abd, which the enemy had laced with little bombs, and camped in the Gebel Akhdar, the Green Mountain just inland from the coastal plain. [...] Once inside the occupied city, their patrol {{came face to face with}} Italian soldiers several times; Maclean, with his excellent Italian, managed to bluff his way out of all of these encounters by pretending to be a staff officer. They spent two nights and a day in the city. They had hoped to sabotage ships, but both the rubber boats they had brought with them failed to inflate, so they treated the visit as a reconnaissance mission. <b>The</b> <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> was uneventful, but nearing Cairo, Maclean, along with most of his party, was seriously injured in a crash and spent months out of action.|$|E

50|$|Like {{most of the}} Proto 2000 locomotives, both {{versions}} of these models were plague by mechanical problems. One problem was the grease that was used far in excess of what was necessary by the factory, and was of very poor quality. It would harden quickly, if the locomotive was stored in a dry environment, this caused the trucks and worm gear shaft to seize, jamming the drive-train and rendering the locomotive inoperative. Repairs, would normally require, the locomotive to be completely disassembled and de-greased, then re-lucubrated to get <b>the</b> <b>drives</b> <b>back</b> in running order.|$|R
