He brings such a cool, amazing, intensity as Robert California thats so different from Michael Scott. Michael wanted everyone to love him. Robert California wants to run the best company in the world, and to see him turn that kind of intensity onto Kevin Malone was cracking me up. I just love him as this character.

Robert has had his moments of brilliance in the past, but this wasnt one of them. He was merely a tool here, and yeah, I mean that in both senses. Its pretty clear by this time that the writers have never quite gotten a handle on the character or figured out how to use him properly since he joined the cast. With Spader leaving at the end of this season, that wont be a problem for much longer. In the meantime, we have to put up with a character who is all over the map. One week hes quirky and zen, the next week he might be vulnerable and mopey, the next hes a ruthless, calculating executive. Theres still some time to pin him down by the season finale, its just hard to imagine at this point". In her review of the season 8 finale, she wrote [...] "At least we saw that last of Robert California, who walked away with $1 million to travel around Europe educating gymnasts. Um, okay.

5000|$|The Fontamaresi {{often are}} quite passive in their reactions, {{attributing}} events to Gods will or destiny. For instance, Maria Rosa, Berardos mother, says Berardos {{not a bad}} man, but he was born under an unlucky star, poor fellow. What a hard destiny is his. Religious references are used to foreshadow what will come, for example Donna Clorinda prays to Saint Antonio and believes her prayers are answered when she sees Baldissera in Sulmona. Nazzarena, Elviras mother, had a dream when Elvira was born that the Virgin Mary said to her I give you the most beautiful of my doves but {{you and your husband}} will pay for it with great suffering. Nazzarena herself dies and her husband is very ill. Elvira goes on a pilgrimage to the Madonna to take her life and to help Berardo in return and her prayers are granted and she dies in bed from a high fever.There are also signs of the cross in the book, for example an insect appears when Cav. Pelino is persuading them to sign the petition. Marietta claims I <b>think</b> <b>its</b> <b>a</b> new kind. Darker, longer and with a cross on its back. Zompa explains that God decided that a new kind of louse should appear after every big revolution and then goes on to explain a dream he had. Priest don Abbachio had forbidden him to tell anyone. In the dream Jesus is talking to the Pope and requesting the Fucino be given to the cafoni,that the cafoni be exempt from taxes and that they enjoy an abundant harvest whilst the Pope takes the view of the authorities that Prince Torlonia, nor the government would agree and that an abundant harvest would cause food prices to fall. The Pope releases a cloud of lice on the houses of the poor so that in moments of idleness you have something to distract your thoughts from sin Moreover, when Berardo is being tortured, and fighting back they dragged him back to the cell by his legs and shoulders like Christ when He was taken down from the cross. Berardo, in sacrificing himself for others, could be interpreted as a Christ-like figure.It is interesting that the story of San Giuseppe da Copertino, told by don Abbachio, a story they had heard many times before, shows they think Jesus has a different attitude to rich and poor. In the church there is a picture of the Eucharist with Jesus holding a piece of white bread.Jesus was not talking of the dark bread that the cafoni eat, or the tasteless substitute for bread that is the consecrated wafer of the priests.

5000|$|Final {{opinions}} on the album were mixed. Hope called it [...] "an easy listen with the same soothing vocals and clean cut sing-a-long choruses weve grown to love. Overall a great offering but not overly addictive." [...] Beringer praised the bands growth in musicianship {{in the years since}} From Here to Infirmary, but also commented that This Addiction [...] "could be polarizing to fans, splitting them into three groups: fans who love the album because {{it goes back to the}} bands roots, fans who dislike this album because they may <b>think</b> <b>its</b> <b>a</b> cheap imitation of older days, and the fans who might think this is a step backwards from the previous album." [...] Heisel concluded that [...] "while This Addiction might not be perfect, its a more than respectable entry into the bands already sizeable canon, proving that though they may be in that rarified group of punk-rock lifers, Alkaline Trio arent done evolving yet." [...] Apar stated that although the album was purported to be a return to the early sound of Goddamnit, he found it more comparable to From Here to Infirmary [...] "since the end result is still the same polished album full of vaguely gothic and bloody references where characters like Draculina live -- no real bitterness, sore-throat defiance, or endearing heartache to be found." [...] Though complimenting [...] "This Addiction" [...] and [...] "Off the Map" [...] as strong songs, he felt that the album failed to live up to its expectations as a return to roots: [...] "Alkaline Trio just cant seem to recapture the spirit of their early days, when purpose and emotion fueled every note. Instead, one is left with totally competent -- and at times, yes, catchy -- songs that ring just a bit too hollow compared to the urgent leave-it-all-on-the-floor guts of those earliest releases ... despite the polished and punchy singalong choruses, This Addiction is really just more of the same recycled melodies from the Trio rather than any sort of rebirth." [...] Andrew Kelham of Rock Sound agreed that the album did not succeed in recapturing the bands early sound, but was a strong effort nonetheless: [...] "Alkaline Trio arent naïve punk rockers from the Chicago suburbs anymore, as a result this album fails to recapture that innocence but succeeds in creating another strong body of work that the group can be proud of." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin remarked that the [...] "cozier confines" [...] of an independent label [...] "appear to have put the band at ease" [...] and that their [...] "hooky, blood-soaked bad-love allegories ... satisfy like heartburn-inducing comfort food." [...] French concluded that [...] "This Addiction isnt so much a return to form, but rather a summary--a sonic scrapbook of sorts that carefully documents their entire career, from sour home Chicago to the dressing rooms of Late Night with Conan OBrien." ...|$|E
40|$|Based on Santa Coloma {{as a main}} case,analyzing how can be update {{there in}} this crisis {{situation}} to do suitable interventions to achieve a great effect. After analyzing the Santa Coloma area,I pay attention to its urban marginality. It has the territorial marginality,the marginality of the relationship with Barcelona,the marginality {{of the people and}} life style and so on. Urban fringe is corresponding the city center, the city of mainstream. The socalled "fringe" can be understand at least contain the following meaning:Urban border space, the fringe people of the crowd, the fringe life style, it can be adjusted on the political significance of urban public about the organization and allocation of resources,it also can be about the relationship of the border between the city and urban development, the relationship between the urban and natural environment. The attention to its urban marginality actual is a determination and also a orientation to the situation of Santa Coloma. Make it easer to find the characteristics of this area,and then find a suitable relationship with Barcelona even with other cities,and also is good for find the form of its renewal. For Santa Coloma,it is an area multicultural,energetic,close to nature and also clutter and messy,they think is a place that easer to live than other city place but lack of sense of local self-identity,maybe also themselves;For “Barcelona person”,Santa Coloma is an area where there is an Ikea and can ride bike but full of immigrants and maybe not safely;And for the Chinese people who live in Barcelona,Fondo is a metro station where can find many of Chinese restaurants and commodities but far from the city center,In addition to this,sometimes in the area of Badalona there are more chooses. So for each group of people,Santa Coloma is not a place very good and essential. But actually,when i have being go there many times,i really <b>think</b> <b>its</b> <b>a</b> attractive place. So for renewal of this fringe area,i think at first {{the most important thing is}} to establish a “spiritual center”,a place can make people who live here produce a sense of identity and deposit “collective memory”[2] which is mentioned in the Rossi’s. Second,is make more connections between Santa Coloma and Barcelona even between other cities and Santa Coloma to offer more opportunity and make more possible to let each other to flow. And then,is the connection of inner Santa Coloma. So in this situation of the city fringe renewal i think its good to introduce the concept of “Urban catalysts”[1]which is the concept of the book ,to make a responds and explain to my proposal to the Santa Coloma. And also with the project of 5 th student is very interesting,we can see different attitudes to the same place. And also its a comparing with my attitude to this area...|$|E
40|$|Internet routing {{protocols}} (BGP, OSPF, RIP) have traditionally favored responsiveness over consistency. A router applies a received update immediately to its forwarding table before propagating the update to other routers, {{including those that}} potentially depend upon {{the outcome of the}} update. Responsiveness comes at the cost of routing loops and blackholes—a router <b>A</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>its</b> route to <b>a</b> destination is via B but B disagrees. By favoring responsiveness (a liveness property) over consistency (a safety property), Internet routing has lost both. Our position is that consistent state in a distributed system makes its behavior more predictable and securable. To this end, we present consensus routing, a consistencyfirst approach that cleanly separates safety and liveness using two logically distinct modes of packet delivery: a stable mode where a route is adopted only after all dependent routers have agreed upon it, and a transient mode that heuristically forwards the small fraction of packets that encounter failed links. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that consensus routing improves overall availability when used in conjunction with existing transient mode heuristics such as backup paths, deflections, or detouring. Experiments on the Internet’s AS-level topology show that consensus routing eliminates nearly all transient disconnectivity in BGP. ...|$|R
