5|$|North Carolina edged James Madison 5250 in {{the first}} round of the NCAA Tournament. The Tar Heels beat Alabama in the {{succeeding}} round to advance to the regional final against Villanova. North Carolina advanced to the Final Four with a 70–60 over Villanova as each starter scored over ten points. In the national semifinal, North Carolina was pitted against Houston. The Tar Heels opened the game with a 140 run. Houston overcame <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> tied the game at 29 just a few minutes before the half.

5|$|The Labour party {{conference in}} Manchester on 21–24 September {{occurred}} {{days after the}} Scottish referendum result.

At the conference, Miliband pledged to focus on six national goals for Britain until 2025, including boosting pay, apprenticeships and housing; a mansion tax and levy on tobacco companies to fund £2.5 billion a year 'time to care' fund for the NHS; a commitment to {{raise the minimum wage}} to £8 or more by 2020; and a promise to lower the voting age to 16 ready for elections in 2016.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, {{the light}} was again poor, but England did not appeal to the umpires for an adjournment. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor {{visibility}} in order to eradicate <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> build a lead, so that if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket, Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface. Bradman anticipated rain, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensively to slow England's progress {{in the hope that}} the hosts would not have a lead by the time a sticky wicket materialised. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless {{the light was}} so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen. In foggy and misty conditions, Hardstaff brought up England's 200 with a strongly-hit hook that almost hit Barnes. Compton then hit a boundary from Toshack, prompting Bradman to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions. Scoring was slow as Toshack pinned down the batsmen with an effective leg stump line.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{empirical}} relationship between budget <b>and</b> current account <b>deficits</b> in <b>the</b> {{case of a}} small developing country, Sri Lanka {{for the period of}} 1960 - 2010. The data are collected from annual reports, Centra! Bank, Sri Lanka. The econometric methods used in this study are cointegration technique, Error correction modeling and Granger causality analysis. The empirical results are consistent with conventional view.

5|$|Like his father, Adams {{embarked}} on a political career {{with the support of}} the Boston Caucus. He was elected to his first political office in 1747, serving as one of the clerks of the Boston market. In 1756, the Boston Town Meeting elected him to the post of tax collector, which provided a small income. He often failed to collect taxes from his fellow citizens, which increased his popularity among those who did not pay, but left him liable for the shortage. By 1765, his account was more than £8,000 in arrears. The town meeting was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Adams was compelled to file suit against delinquent taxpayers, but many taxes went uncollected. In 1768, his political opponents used the situation to their advantage, obtaining a court judgment of £1,463 against him. Adams's friends paid off some of <b>the</b> <b>deficit,</b> <b>and</b> the town meeting wrote off the remainder. By then, he had emerged as a leader of the popular party, and the embarrassing situation did not lessen his influence.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{validity}} was analyzed of <b>the</b> triple <b>deficit</b> hypothesis in Turkey between the years 1960 and 2012.

As a result of unit root tests, it was concluded that all the positive and negative shocks were I(1).

As a result of the asymmetric causality test, bi-directional causality was found between <b>the</b> current account <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> budget <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> between <b>the</b> current account <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> savings gap.

5|$|Cavallo began {{a second}} wave of privatizations with the Correo Argentino and the nuclear power plants. He also limited {{the amount of money}} {{released}} to the provinces. He still had the full support of Menem, despite growing opposition within the PJ. The Mexican Tequila Crisis impacted the national economy, causing a deficit, recession, and a growth in unemployment. The government further reduced public expenditures, the wages of state workers, and raised taxes. <b>The</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> recession were reduced, but unemployment stayed high. External debt increased. The crisis also proved that the economic system was vulnerable to capital flight. The growing discontent over unemployment and the scandals caused by the privatization of the Correo led to Cavallo's removal as minister, and his replacement by Roque Fernández. Fernández maintained Cavallo's fiscal austerity. He increased the price of fuels, sold the state shares of YPF to Repsol, fired state employees, and increased the value-added tax to 21%. He also undertook more privatization. A new labor law was met with resistance, both by Peronists, opposition parties, and unions, and could not be approved by Congress. The 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crisis also affected the country with consequences that lasted longer than the Tequilla Crisis and started a depression.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{signed for}} League Two team Notts County on a two-year {{contract}} on 22 July 2009, {{on the same}} day that Sven-Göran Eriksson arrived at the club as director of football. He scored a hat-trick on his debut in a 5–0 victory over Bradford City on the opening day of the season. He then got his second hat-trick against Northampton Town in a 5–2 home win on 12 September. He claimed his third hat-trick of the campaign on 28 December during a 4–1 win over Burton Albion at the Pirelli Stadium. However the club endured a turbulent time, with manager Ian McParland sacked and replaced by Hans Backe, who himself resigned after Qadbak Investments proved unable to fund Backe's wages. New owner Ray Trew appointed Steve Cotterill as manager, and County entered April ten points behind league leaders Rochdale, though Hughes remained confident that they could reduce <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> win the league. On 17 April, Hughes scored two goals in a 4–1 victory over Morecambe as County won promotion to League One. He was named as League Two's Player of the Month in April. On 1 May, Hughes added another two goals in County's final home game of the season, making him the first Notts player to score 30 league goals since Tommy Lawton in the 1949–50 season. He finished as the division's top-scorer in 2009–10 with 30 league goals in 39 games, and was named on the PFA Team of the Year alongside teammates Kasper Schmeichel and Ben Davies. County won the league by a ten-point margin. In July 2010, Hughes signed a one-year extension to his contract that would see him at Meadow Lane until the summer of 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Manchester City {{once again}} {{qualified}} for the UEFA Cup through the Fair Play rankings. As City had to play the qualifying rounds, it meant a very early start to the season, in mid-July. Their first match was {{a trip to the}} remote Faroe Islands to play EB/Streymur. As Streymur's ground had a capacity of only 1,000, the match was moved to Tórsvøllur, the Faroese national stadium. Two early goals gave City a 2–0 win. The home leg was unusual in that it was played outside Manchester. The pitch at the City of Manchester Stadium had been relaid following a Bon Jovi concert, and was not ready in time. Instead, the match was played at Barnsley's Oakwell ground. Another 2–0 win resulted in a 4–0 aggregate scoreline. In the second qualifying round City played FC Midtjylland. The first leg ended in a 1–0 defeat, only City's second ever home defeat in European competition. In the second leg City looked to be heading out of the competition until an 89th minute cross was diverted into his own net by Midtjylland's Danny Califf. The tie then went to extra time, and City progressed on penalties.
