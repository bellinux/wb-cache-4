In January 2009, NASA scientists announced that they had discovered that the planet often vents methane into the atmosphere in specific areas, leading some to speculate this may be a sign of biological activity below the surface. Studies of a Weather Research and Forecasting model for Mars (MarsWRF) and related Mars general circulation model (MGCM) suggests that methane plume sources may be located within tens of kilometers, which is within the roving capabilities of future Mars rovers.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{restoration}} mechanisms to handle channel and link failures in an optical WDM wavelength-routed wide-area backbone network {{based on a}} mesh topology. The solution uses {{a small number of}} <b>tunable</b> <b>lasers</b> per link to provide restoration capability. In addition to link failures, we consider individual channel failures which might occur when one or more transceivers fail at the source of the lightpath or due to a failure in the switch fabric. Restoration is first attempted using the <b>tunable</b> <b>lasers</b> to transmit on the failed wavelengths. If all the failed lightpaths cannot be restored using the <b>tunable</b> <b>lasers,</b> unused wavelengths on the same link are used (this requires optical wavelength conversion at the nodes). For the remaining lightpaths requiring restoration, link-level restoration mechanisms are attempted. Two different link-level mechanisms are presented: redirection algorithm (RDA) and disjoint path algorithm (DPA). These mechanisms use WDM-specific link information to compute the link restoration routes. We present results based on discrete-event simulations to understand the performance of the proposed mechanisms, in terms of restoration efficiency and restoration times. The results show that for networks of varying size and node degree with 32 wavelengths on each link, using as few as 8 <b>tunable</b> <b>lasers</b> per link provides good restoration efficiency under moderate traffic load...|$|R
