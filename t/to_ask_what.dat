5|$|Another {{important}} {{argument in}} favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus feels like.|$|E
5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student {{to contribute to the}} intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the most provocative ones.|$|E

What is the smell of coffee for?" [...] Each question sounded like a sentence: they are for pleasure, for emotion, for living.|$|R

25|$|An {{interesting}} wrinkle {{to these}} fact pattern is <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> {{happens when the}} person trying to make recovery is the gambler's spouse, and the money or property lost was either the spouse's, or was community property.

25|$|The above {{similarities}} {{have led}} scholars <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> relationship did Brehons have with clerics. Some scholars, known as anti-nativists, {{have suggested that}} the Brehons were nothing more than clerics who had training in secular law. In addition to the similarities and evidence of borrowing from Canon law and the Bible, scholars who hold this position ask how any non Clerics could have been sufficiently literate at this period to create the texts. Other scholars, known as nativists, have asked how the differences could arise if the authors of canon and secular law were indeed the same.|$|E

25|$|Stefan said {{he would}} have tried out the last idea at his own house in England. He {{probably}} meant St Thomas's Mills at Stratford, London, which Henry had given him, then taken away in 1544. Stefan seems not to have found work, but he did come back to England. On 9 January 1547, the Imperial ambassador in London, François van der Delft, wrote to Mary of Austria <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> he should do about Haschenperg. Stefan and his wife had come to London thinking that Mary's letters would get his job back. Van der Delft suggested he should not intercede between Henry VIII and his servant. Stefan then became a steward of Jan Dubravius, Bishop of Olmütz, in Bohemia.|$|E
25|$|A {{change in}} market {{conditions}} {{also contributed to}} Borland's fall from prominence. In the 1980s, companies had few people who understood the growing personal computer phenomenon, and so most technical people were given free rein to purchase whatever software they thought they needed. Borland had {{done an excellent job}} marketing to those with a highly technical bent. By the mid-1990s, however, companies were beginning <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> the return was on the investment they had made in this loosely controlled PC software buying spree. Company executives were starting to ask questions that were hard for technically minded staff to answer, and so corporate standards began to be created. This required new kinds of marketing and support materials from software vendors, but Borland remained focused on the technical side of its products.|$|E
25|$|By {{the morning}} of Saturday 21 Wilson was talking of resigning and urging his staff to do the same, {{although}} he never actually did so and forfeited respect by talking too much of bringing down the government. With Parliament debating a Conservative motion of censure on the government for using the Army in Ulster, Repington telephoned Wilson (21 April 1914) <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> line The Times should take. Fresh from a visit to Bonar Law (21 March), Wilson suggested prodding Asquith to take “instant action” to prevent general staff resignations. At the request of Seely (Secretary of State for War) Wilson wrote a summary of “what the army would agree to”, namely a promise that the army would {{not be used to}} coerce Ulster, but this was not acceptable to the government. Despite Robertson’s warm support, Wilson was unable to persuade French to warn the government that the Army would not move against Ulster.|$|E

25|$|God's {{word came}} to Jeremiah {{a second time}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> he saw, he replied that he saw a seething pot tipping from the north, and God said {{that out of the}} north evil would break forth upon all Israel. For God would call all the kingdoms of the north to come, and they would set their thrones at Jerusalem's gate, against its walls, and against the cities of Judah. God would utter God's {{judgments}} against Judah, as its people had forsaken God and worshipped the work of their own hands. God thus directed Jeremiah to gird his loins, arise, and speak to the Judean people all that God commanded, for God had made Jeremiah a fortified city, an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the land of Judah, its rulers, its priests, and its people. They would fight against him, but they would not prevail, for God would be with him to deliver him.|$|E

[...] During the meal, industrialist and future senator Mark Hanna interrupted them <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> Garret Hobart thought of the possible presidential candidacy of Ohio Governor William McKinley—Hanna was one of McKinley's principal backers. [...] Garret Hobart evaded the question, but Jennie Hobart believed the conversation to have been the first of a chain of events which elevated her husband to national office.|$|E
500|$|Napoleon {{maintained}} strict, efficient work habits, prioritizing {{what needed}} to be done. He cheated at cards, but repaid the losses; he had to win at everything he attempted. He kept relays of staff and secretaries at work. Unlike many generals, Napoleon did not examine history <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> Hannibal or Alexander or anyone else did in a similar situation. Critics said he won many battles simply because of luck; Napoleon responded, [...] "Give me lucky generals", aware that [...] "luck" [...] comes to leaders who recognize opportunity, and seize it. Dwyer states that Napoleon's victories at Austerlitz and Jena in 1805–06 heightened his sense of self-grandiosity, leaving him even more certain of his destiny and invincibility.|$|E

500|$|During {{his first}} term at Arnold House Waugh found few {{opportunities}} to continue his writing. He was tired {{by the end of}} the day, his interest in The Temple flagged, and from time to time his attention wandered to other subjects; he contemplated a book on Silenus, but he admitted that it [...] "may or may not ... be written". After the Easter holidays he felt more positively about The Temple: [...] "I am making the first chapter a cinema film, and have been writing furiously ever since. I honestly think that it is going to be rather good". He sometimes worked on the book during classes, telling any boys who dared <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> he was doing that he was writing a history of the Eskimos. By June he felt confident enough to send the first few chapters to his Oxford friend Harold Acton, [...] "asking for criticism and hoping for praise". Earlier that year Waugh had commented warmly on Acton's book of poems, An Indian Ass, [...] "which brought back memories of a life [...] infinitely remote".|$|E
500|$|As the 30th anniversary approached, Gerrold {{had heard}} {{rumors of a}} tribble-sequel in the works but had only heard denials from {{executive}} producer Rick Berman.

Gerrold suggested that an acknowledgement of the creator of the tribbles might be in order and asked if he could be an extra. He was cast as a security redshirt. While Gerrold was on set, he also advised director Jonathan West on the integration of new scenes into [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles". Gerrold later said that [...] "Trials and Tribble-ations" [...] "turned out beautiful. I think it was the best episode of Deep Space Nine ever and possibly the best episode of Star Trek after the Original Series." [...] Charlie Brill returned as Arne Darvin to film new scenes set in the DS9 timeframe.|$|E
