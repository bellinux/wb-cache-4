500|$|In January 2008, Hamasaki {{announced}} on her blog that an inoperable condition, possibly tinnitus or Ménière's disease, had caused complete deafness {{in her left}} ear. She {{had been diagnosed with}} the condition in 2006 and that the problem dated to 2000, when she developed an ear infection but continued to perform against the advice of doctors. Despite the setback, Hamasaki stated that she wished to continue singing, and that [...] "as a professional", she wanted to [...] "deliver the best performance for everyone". On May 20, 2017, she wrote that she is also losing hearing in her right ear, and had experienced dizziness and nausea. She vowed to continue performing, writing: [...] "The stage is where I belong. It's <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> really, truly exist. I don't know anything else." ...|$|E
2500|$|I kept {{up playing}} drums until I moved to London. I'd {{always wanted to}} be a good drummer and it's just ironic that I've turned out to be a bass player. The way I started playing bass was that when I arrived in London I was looking for a job, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> could find one was in Macaris in Charing Cross Rd. I wanted to get {{something}} involved in music, and that seemed like a good place to be. But Macaris didn't sell drums, and so I lied and said I could play bass. They said, [...] "Fine, you sell the basses, and sweep up and get the coffees and whatever".|$|E
2500|$|Norfolk is {{the home}} county of Deaf Havana {{and many of the}} songs on Fools and Worthless Liars focus on the members childhoods' in the area. [...] "Hunstanton Pier" [...] is about the town of Hunstanton, where James Veck-Gilodi and bassist Lee Wilson went to school. 'It brings me back to <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> ever really felt at home, and how much I miss it. It's hard for me to sing {{sometimes}} because it leads my mind to wander off and think about all the people I used to be so close to and what they are doing now'. [...] "Youth In Retrospect" [...] also deals with nostalgia and is again particularly personal to Veck-Gilodi and Lee Wilson. James has revealed that he is 'constantly battling with the fact that I'm constantly growing older' and how the pair 'wish we could go back to the days where... our biggest worry was whether our maths homework would be in on time'. [...] "Times Change, Friends Leave and Life Doesn't Stop For Anybody" [...] is about former member Ryan Mellor, with whom James has been friends since they were 14. 'This song is just, I suppose, about how much we miss him'.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are {{different}} ways of thinking," [...] said his father. [...] "Church was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> COULD have gone that St. Barnabas' Day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I must go; but I don't {{know how}} to tear myself from the sight of you. I feel as if I was driven from <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> ever might be good.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allah," [...] he cried, [...] "thou seest what I got; [...] Thy {{servants}} bar me {{from the}} sacred spot." [...] "Be comforted," [...] the Holy One replied; [...] "It is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> am not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon we're {{two of a}} kind," [...] he said. [...] "It was a {{woman who}} drove me into the desert. But I come to remember. The desert's <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> can do that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will be fine, Dave! I {{would like}} to match some ribbon, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> can do {{it is in the}} French Shop in Coburntown;" [...] and thus {{speaking}} Laura Porter hurried out of the room {{to get ready for the}} sleigh-ride.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{sister is}} always resorting to watering-places. My nieces {{do nothing but}} play on the piano. No, I shall perhaps go off to America, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> have not seen yet, and I more than half engaged to go and help at Poonshedagore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Belarab's the man {{for this}} job. His is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> can look for help, but I don't think I know enough to find it. I wish I had old Jorgenson here--just for ten minutes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eight in {{the middle}} of the Big River," [...] replied Mrs. Quack. [...] "It was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> safe <b>place.</b> <b>I</b> didn't dare go near either shore, and I'm nearly starved. I haven't had a mouthful to eat to-day." ...|$|R
2500|$|The earlier {{black and}} white episodes used the theme song [...] "Out of Town" [...] by Leslie Bricusse and Robin Beaumont, {{performed}} by Max Bygraves. The lyrics begin: [...] "Say what you will, the countryside is still, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> that <b>I</b> can settle down".|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I am sure I shall like Thrums, {{though those}} teas to the {{congregation}} {{are a little}} trying. Do you know, Thrums is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> was ever in where {{it struck me that}} the men are cleverer than the women." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rooney's," [...] {{said the}} girl, {{softened}} at once by his amends, [...] "is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> know where a lady can smoke. Maybe it ain't a nice habit, but aunty lets us at home. And my name ain't Maudy, if you please; it's Ruby Delamere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your age {{has nothing}} to do with it," [...] I retorted. [...] "It is because Stillwater is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> have to run wild in ... and running wild is all I'm fit for. It's so lovely and roomy I can lose myself in it. I shall die or go mad if I'm cooped up on our little pocket {{handkerchief}} of a lawn." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{see nothing}} {{of you in}} <b>the</b> papers, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> don't wish to see you; but you will be in town in the Winter. What dost thou do? shoot, hunt, and [...] "wind up y'e Clock" [...] as Caleb Quotem says? [1] ...|$|R
5000|$|Newman {{was also}} {{asked if it}} was hard to write the lyrics about love and break-up, he said, [...] "No, it's <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> really open up to somebody, through my music. I'm {{producing}} album and writing it, it's good. I like to keep a hold of everything".|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not for}} a {{young lady}} reason," [...] said Rachel, bluntly. [...] "I want to {{understand}} the principle of diffused education, as there practised. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> other <b>places</b> <b>I</b> should really care to see are the Grand Reformatory for the Destitute in Holland, and the Hospital for Cretins in Switzerland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--why, Captain Rule, I'm nat'rally economical. That {{would be}} wasteful, and waste I set {{down for a}} sin. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> {{calculate}} on throwing the shot, is into the face and eyes of the English. For my part, I wish Nelson himself {{was in one of}} them boats--I wish the man no harm; but I do wish he was in one of them very boats." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she said, [...] "I {{have been}} in rooms at a {{farmhouse}} there, Caynsard's farm. I went away because I {{did not like the}} life here, and because my stepmother," [...] she continued, turning toward the Count, [...] "seemed determined that I should marry you. I thought that I would go away into the country, somewhere where I could think quietly. I went to Salthouse because it was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> knew." ...|$|E
60|$|Avalon is {{so clean}} and sweet. It is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> have been, except Long Key, where the omnipresent, hateful, and stinking {{automobile}} does not obtrude upon real content. Think of air not reeking with gasolene and a street safe to cross at any time! Safe, I mean, of course, from being run down by some joy-rider. You {{are liable to}} encounter one of the Loreleis or Aphrodites at any hour from five till sunset. You must risk chance of that.|$|E
5000|$|Bernal is not double jointed, {{a popular}} misconception. He says:"I’m not double-jointed at all. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> am double-jointed is my thumbs, which doesn’t even matter. I would say I’m {{probably}} a little more flexible than most people in certain areas, mainly my shoulders and my ankles, but I wasn’t born that way. Those areas became flexible because of years of practicing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Speaking at the National Press Club to mark his retirement, CBS {{commentator}} Eric Sevareid {{called the}} club the [...] "sanctum sanctorum of American journalists" [...] and said [...] "It's the Westminster Hall, it's Delphi, it's Mecca, the Wailing Wall {{for everybody in}} this country having {{anything to do with}} the news business; <b>the</b> <b>only</b> hallowed <b>place</b> <b>I</b> know of that's absolutely bursting with irreverence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{cleanliness}} {{and decency}} quite out of keeping with democratic views? I'm fond of swimming, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> {{can get into}} the river now is the big pool beside the Thorndale road. It's a trifle public even at seven A. M., but my landlady objects to my bathing here, and since I can't afford the necessary apparatus I don't blame her. She says it brings the plaster off the lower ceilings, and I really think it does." ...|$|R
60|$|My old army {{experience}} I found indeed of {{very great}} service. I was no clerk, nor had I any capacity to become one. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> ever found {{in my life}} to put a paper so as to find it again was either a side coat-pocket or the hands of a clerk or secretary more careful than myself. But I had been quartermaster, commissary and adjutant in the field. The army forms were familiar to me and I could direct how they should be made out. There was a clerk {{in the office of the}} Adjutant-General who supplied my deficiencies. The ease with which the State of Illinois settled its accounts with the government at the close of the war is evidence of the efficiency of Mr. Loomis as an accountant on a large scale. He remained in the office until that time.|$|E
60|$|After three {{trips to}} Marsh Pass and Kayenta with my old guide, Al Doyle of Flagstaff, I finally {{succeeded in getting}} Wetherill to take me in to Nonnezoshe. This was {{in the spring of}} 1913 and my party was the second one, not scientific, to make the trip. Later this same year Wetherill took in the Roosevelt party and after that the Kolb brothers. It is a safe thing to say that this trip {{is one of the most}} {{beautiful}} in the West. It is a hard one and not for everybody. There is no guide except Wetherill, who knows how to get there. And after Doyle and I came out we admitted that we would not care to try to return over our back trail. We doubted if we could find the way. This is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> have ever visited which I am not sure I could find again alone.|$|E
60|$|I CREPT {{to their}} doors and listened; they was snoring. So I tiptoed along, and got down stairs all right. There warn't a sound anywheres. I peeped {{through a crack}} of the dining-room door, and see the men that was {{watching}} the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs. The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, {{and there was a}} candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't there. Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me. I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> see to hide the bag was in the coffin. The lid was shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on. I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.|$|E
5000|$|... "Rummage and Loss" [...] (1977), {{short story}} by David Black {{published}} in Harper's Magazine. In the story, Black reminisces about Jacques-Louis David's neoclassical painting of Homer Reciting his Verses to <b>the</b> Greeks: <b>The</b> <b>only</b> other <b>place</b> <b>I</b> had seen people in togas before was in Flash Gordon movies ... the scene {{struck me as}} classic science fiction: an elder of Betelgeuse warns the cosmic council about {{the invasion of the}} Centauri locust-gods.

6000|$|... "SIR: I have {{to report}} that I have for the last {{fortnight}} been [...] engaged in driving about the country in accordance with Miss [...] Covington's instructions. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> can ascertain that [...] the pony and cart from Tilbury was noticed about that time was at [...] Stanford. My inquiries there before had failed, but after dining at [...] the inn, I {{went out into the}} yard behind, and asked the helper [...] whether the same trap that I drove over in from Tilbury had been [...] there since.|$|R
60|$|I {{was in my}} {{old place}} at the Coliseum this morning, {{and it was as}} grand as ever. With that {{exception}} the ruined part of Rome--the real original Rome--looks smaller than my remembrance made it. It is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> on which <b>I</b> have yet found that effect. We are in the old hotel.|$|R

5000|$|Johnny Marr {{has stated}} in {{interviews}} {{that one of}} the main impetuses for his leaving The Smiths was Morrisey's insistence on covering the titular theme song to this movie. There is a famous quote published in a 1992 issue of [...] "Record Collector" [...] where Marr disdainfully said [...] "'Work Is A Four Letter Word' I hated. That was the last straw, really. I didn't form a group to perform Cilla Black songs. That was it, really. I made a decision that I was going to get away on holiday. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> could think of was L.A. L.A. was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> knew where there'd be sunshine, so off I went. I never saw Morrissey again." ...|$|E
5000|$|Morrissey's {{insistence on}} {{releasing}} this single incurred {{the wrath of}} Johnny Marr, due to his dislike of the B-side, and he left the band not long afterwards. Marr recalled to Record Collector magazine in 1992: [...] "'Work Is A Four Letter Word' I hated. That was the last straw, really. I didn't form a group to perform Cilla Black songs. That was it, really. I {{made a decision that}} I was going to get away on holiday. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> could think of was L.A. L.A. was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> knew where there'd be sunshine, so off I went. I never saw Morrissey again." [...] The video, which featured clips from the film The Leather Boys (starring Rita Tushingham), was directed by Tim Broad. BBC Radio 1 refused to play the song. Morrissey later commented, [...] "You're not really supposed to like those songs. They're very depressing and not supposed to be played on radio." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can {{you suggest}} any plan, love," [...] he went on, [...] "which may save me the {{necessity}} of a journey to London at this bleak time of the year? I must positively have this information, and, so far as I can see, London is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> at which <b>I</b> can hope to meet with a file of the Times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{him with}} you," [...] cried Kate. [...] "Two women {{travelling}} to unknown shores might readily need a protector, and if not, {{there are so}} many things which he might do.
