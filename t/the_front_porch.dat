5|$|Beginning in childhood, Crawford's {{ambition}} {{was to be}} a dancer. One day, however, in {{an attempt}} to escape piano lessons so she could play with friends, she leapt from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> of her home and cut her foot severely on a broken milk bottle. As a result, she experienced three surgeries to repair the damage. She was unable to attend elementary school or continue with dancing lessons for 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Every few weeks, the Nazis {{staged a}} roundup in the Lvov ghetto of people unable to work. These roundups {{typically}} took place while the able-bodied were absent doing forced labour. In one such deportation, Wiesenthal's mother and other elderly Jewish women were transported by freight train to Belzec extermination camp {{and killed in}} August 1942. Around the same time, a Ukrainian policeman shot Cyla's mother to death on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> of her home in Buczacz while she was being evicted. Cyla and Simon Wiesenthal lost 89 relatives during the Holocaust.|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} to the main house is built in the colonial style with two rows of three arches, supported by Doric columns and wide staircase that leads to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>porches.</b> <b>The</b> hacienda chapel retains its original floors, dating from the seventeenth century.|$|R

5|$|In {{preparation}} for {{her marriage to}} Mardjan, Atikah is secluded at home. Learning of this betrothal, Rachmat goes to Doerachman and, after fighting Mardjan and his men, takes the hadji to the village where he and Atikah had initiated development programs. As they had all worked in Doerachman's name, the villagers do not fear him, but respect him. This, {{and the extent of}} the developments, makes Doerachman realise that hoarding his wealth for himself does not make him as happy as using it for charity. The two, accompanied by Asmadi, hurry back to Doerachman's home, only to find Mardjan and his men sitting relaxedly on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>porch.</b>|$|E
5|$|The house stands {{mostly as}} it did in 1861 save a few alterations. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> was {{screened}} in at the time the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, the screens have since been removed. At {{the rear of the house}} a small porch was enclosed. In 1909 or 1910 there were major subtractions and replacements. Removed were a cast-iron widow's walk along the roof ridge and a large gable dormer, decorated in the same manner as the cornice decorating the roof trim. The present dormer replaced the larger one and is more of a low-shed type.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery {{for a long time and}} on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E

50|$|The {{houses were}} {{constructed}} for David Boguslavsky, a by Athanase Dussault, a local carpenter. They {{are representative of}} one of the dominant housing type built in the city during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

5|$|Longford Park was {{the home}} of John Rylands, industrialist, philanthropist, and Manchester's first multi-millionaire, from 1855 {{until his death in}} 1888 and of his widow Enriqueta Augustina Rylands until her death in 1908. The house Rylands {{constructed}} in the park in 1857, Longford Hall, was demolished in 1995. It replaced an earlier house of the same name that had been the residence of Thomas Walker (died 1817) and subsequently of his sons Thomas (died 1836) and Charles. Today only <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>porch,</b> coach house, and the stable buildings remain. The estate and hall were sold to Stretford Council in 1911 after a poll of ratepayers, and the park was opened to the public the following year.|$|E
5|$|The series plot {{revolves}} around Sheriff Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith) {{and his life}} in sleepy, slow-paced fictional Mayberry, North Carolina. Sheriff Taylor's level-headed approach to law enforcement makes him the scourge of local moonshiners and out-of-town criminals, while his abilities to settle community problems with common-sense advice, mediation, and conciliation make him popular with his fellow citizens. His professional life, however, {{is complicated by the}} repeated gaffes of his inept deputy, Barney Fife (Don Knotts). Barney is portrayed as Andy's cousin in the first, second, and sixth episodes, but is never again referred to as such. Andy socializes with male friends in the Main Street barber shop and dates various ladies until a schoolteacher becomes his steady interest in season three. At home, Andy enjoys fishing trips with his son, Opie (Ronny Howard), and quiet evenings on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> with his maiden aunt and housekeeper, Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier). Opie tests his father's parenting skills season after season, and Aunt Bee's ill-considered romances and adventures cause her nephew concern.|$|E
5|$|The two-story brick {{structure}} {{is supported by}} a fieldstone foundation and still features its original front porch. The porch spans the length of the building's front (south) facade, at a height of about 6feet (1.8m). The porch is supported by four wooden pillars, which rest on stone bases. The stairs leading to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> are supported by two similar wooden posts, which, like the house, are set into fieldstone bases. The first step on the stairs was originally a limestone block embedded in the ground. The porch roof is supported by six wooden, bracketed pillars. The pillars are simple, with the brackets coming from the boxed capitals. At the rear of the porch wooden pilasters set at each end help to support the roof. Differentiating the home from the traditional French Colonial design is the porch roof, which is separate from the main roof.|$|E
50|$|The {{house was}} built about 1887 by Frederick Squire, a jeweler who was {{prominent}} in the local business community. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>porches</b> and other Colonial Revival details were probably added by the house's second owner, who purchased it in 1904. For most of the 20th century it saw a variety of uses, including as a convent for an adjacent school, and as a real estate office.|$|R
50|$|For {{periods of}} time, each parish {{had their own}} style of constructing, mainly shown in <b>the</b> lavish <b>front</b> <b>porches</b> and {{otherwise}} elaborate entrances.

5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>porch,</b> her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E

25|$|In 1956, {{after the}} home was {{purchased}} by Thomas Ennenga, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> was removed and a gable-style dormer was placed into the roof as part of extensive modernizations done to the home. The rear porch was also replaced at that time.|$|E

50|$|The house's heart pine {{woodwork}} and handmade bricks {{highlight the}} attention to detail of its wealthy owner and the Scottish architects and builders he employed. Solid Doric style columns from a castle in Scotland support <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>porches,</b> and <b>the</b> balcony railing is carved to resemble English lace. An entirely self-supporting spiral staircase winds to the second floor, and a secret stairway is set between the walls {{in the back of}} the house.|$|R
25|$|Cave 2 (35.7 m x 21.6 m) {{was started}} in the 460s, but mostly carved between 475 and 477 CE, {{probably}} sponsored and influenced by a woman closely related to emperor Harisena. It has a porch quite different from Cave 1. Even the façade carvings seem to be different. The cave is supported by robust pillars, ornamented with designs. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> consists of cells supported by pillared vestibules on both ends.|$|E
25|$|Three months later, bombs {{exploded}} in the New York subway, in a Philadelphia church, and {{at the home of}} the mayor of Baltimore. The house of one of the jurors in the Dedham trial was bombed, throwing him and his family from their beds. On May 18, 1928, a bomb destroyed <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> of the home of executioner Robert Elliott. As late as 1932, Judge Thayer's home was wrecked and his wife and housekeeper were injured in a bomb blast. Afterward, Thayer lived permanently at his club in Boston, guarded 24 hours a day until his death on April 18, 1933.|$|E
25|$|The front {{facade of}} the {{residence}} consists of eye-catching peach and white brick masonry and stucco front porch with a main arched balcony crowned by a female face. A second, smaller, arched entrance is the main entryway into the porch and house. Early 1900s ironworks gracefully separate <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> from the front street sidewalk. The front doors of the house are wooden louvered characteristic of the middle-to-late 19th century. A circular front wall wind hole with decorative molding accentuates the porch; another smaller circular opening decorates high above the archway into the porch. The interior consists of nine rooms, a long, sunny, lateral hallway with multiple wooden veneer shutters, and an external cobble-stone foyer leading to the back courtyard.|$|E

25|$|Due to its {{location}} amongst the earthworks of the fort, the barracks {{has become a}} centrepiece of Fort Malden. The building was designed based on the simple, standardized military bungalow layout of the 1800s. This prominent building stands out amongst {{the rest of the}} fort structures due to its long, rectangular shape, as well as its distinctive red brick exterior. Large bay windows along the entranceway compliment <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> and wooden doors. As this building was part of the restoration process that took place over the late twentieth century, its interior layout has been altered with refinished hardwood floors and additions to all three sections of the core of the building. The restoration also included the reconstruction of chimneys, doors, and windows.|$|E
