The drum fills on 'A Day in the Life' are very, very complex <b>things.</b> <b>You</b> <b>could</b> take a great drummer from today and say, 'I want it like that', {{and they really}} wouldn't know what to do."

500|$|Scottish {{mezzo-soprano}} Karen Cargill summarized [...] "Maria Radner, {{my beloved}} friend" [...] in The Guardian: [...] "She {{was the most}} generous-spirited person I have ever met. Hysterical laughter, an obsession with all things Burberry, unadulterated passion for Bayern Munich and the warmest of hugs were <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> always be guaranteed of when you were with her. Her son and partner were her whole life." [...] Further down Cargill qualified the latter, in that [...] "Music was Maria's entire life until she met her partner and they had their son." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{making the}} biopic, Dodd Darin and Spacey {{acknowledged}} the similar career experiences between Darin and Spacey. [...] "A {{lot of people}} doubted my dad's abilities, and Kevin's had doubters and naysayers," [...] Dodd commented. [...] "But both [...] {{were willing to take}} risks, and both were very resilient. My dad would always try new <b>things.</b> <b>You</b> <b>could</b> never pin him down. Kevin's career is similar." [...] David Evanier, author of Roman Candle: The Life of Bobby Darin (...) , said [...] "You can put Kevin's obsessiveness about getting the film made right up there with Bobby's obsessiveness. He's also the ideal person to play Bobby. He has an uncanny physical resemblance to him, and he also has Bobby's intensity and dark side. Also, there's the connection with his mother. Bobby's mother's belief in him sent him soaring. Kevin's mother wanted him to make this film. Kevin sees the film as an act of devotion to his mother." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gabriel {{was written}} in the style of action and science fiction movies from the 1980s and early 90s. This was partly because Shane Abbess was {{influenced}} by that era of cinema during his youth and partly because the minuscule budget demanded that the film couldn’t be laden with special effects. Abbess cites the films Alien, Predator and Die Hard as influences. He describes cinema of that era as, [...] "because CG effects weren't huge yet, the whole thing had to be about characters; had to be <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> believe in." [...] Abbess also stated that he [...] "did kinda of want to make one giant cliché." [...] Abbess also intended the film to emulate the intentionally [...] "jumbled quality" [...] of 1980s cinema.|$|E

That was the meaning of TOWER OF IVORY but protestants could not {{understand}} it and made fun of it. One day he had stood beside her looking into the hotel grounds. A waiter was running up a trail of bunting on the flagstaff and a fox terrier was scampering to and fro on the sunny lawn. She had put her hand into his pocket where his hand was and he had felt how cool and thin and soft her hand was. She had said that pockets were funny things to have: {{and then all of a}} sudden she had broken away and had run laughing down the sloping curve of the path. Her fair hair had streamed out behind her like gold in the sun. TOWER OF IVORY. HOUSE OF GOLD. By thinking of <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> understand them.|$|E

60|$|There were a {{good many}} <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do with a gun: you could fire your ramrod out of it, and see it sail through the air; you could fill the muzzle up with water, {{on top of a}} charge, and send the water in a {{straight}} column at a fence. The boys all believed that you could fire that column of water right through a man, and they always wanted to try whether it would go through a cow, but they were afraid the owner of the cow would find it out. There was a good deal of pleasure in cleaning your gun when it got so foul that your ramrod stuck in it and you could hardly get it out. You poured hot water into the muzzle and blew it through the nipple, till it began to show clear; then you wiped it dry with soft rags wound on your gun-screw, and then oiled it with greasy tow. Sometimes the tow would get loose from the screw, and stay in the barrel, and then you would have to pick enough powder in at the nipple to blow it out. Of course I am talking of the old muzzle-loading shot-gun, which I dare say the boys never use nowadays.|$|E
6000|$|At {{that time}} I had become editor of The Atlantic Monthly, and I had allegiances {{belonging}} to the conduct of what was and still remains the most scrupulously cultivated of our periodicals. When Clemens began to write for it he came willingly under its rules, for with all his wilfulness {{there never was a}} more biddable man in <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> show him a reason for. He never made the least of that trouble which so abounds for the hapless editor from narrower-minded contributors. If you wanted a thing changed, very good, he changed it; if you suggested that a word or a sentence or a paragraph had better be struck out, very good, he struck it out. His proof-sheets came back each a veritable [...] "mush of concession," [...] as Emerson says. Now and then he would try a little stronger language than 'The Atlantic' had stomach for, and once when I sent him a proof I made him observe that I had left out the profanity. He wrote back: [...] "Mrs. Clemens opened that proof, and lit into the room with danger in her eye. What profanity? You see, when I read the manuscript to her I skipped that." [...] It was part of his joke to pretend a violence in that gentlest creature which the more amusingly realized the situation to their friends.|$|E
60|$|After all, yellowhammers {{were the}} chief {{reliance}} in the chase; they were pre-occupied, unsuspecting birds, and lit on fence rails and dead trees, {{so that they}} were pretty easy to shoot. If you could bring home a yellowhammer you felt that you had something to show for your long day's tramp through the woods and fields, and for the five cents' worth of powder and five cents' worth of shot that you had fired off at other game. Sometimes you just fired it off at mullein-stalks, or barns, or anything you came to.
