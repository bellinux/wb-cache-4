5|$|Multiple static {{lines of}} defence, {{to delay the}} enemy's advance. Hitler had in fact {{forbidden}} the construction of multiple lines, saying that soldiers would be tempted <b>to</b> <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> current line in favour of falling back to the next; Model ignored this order.|$|E
5|$|Nash himself {{claimed that}} he could have ended Bodyline in two overs without needing to resort to a leg field, as he {{believed}} that the English batsman could not hook and a few overs of sustained, fast short pitched bowling would have caused England <b>to</b> <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> Bodyline tactics.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 June, two Argentine Dagger {{aircraft}} attacked Cardiffs Lynx helicopter, no.335 of 829NAS, while it was searching in the Falkland Sound area. Poor weather had forced the Argentine craft <b>to</b> <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> original mission of bombing Mount Longdon, and the third Dagger of their formation had suffered a mechanical failure and returned to base. The Lynx began evasive manoeuvres and dodged the attacks; the pilot, Lieutenant Christopher Clayton, was mentioned in despatches for his efforts.|$|E
5|$|The {{predictions}} made by Diem and Ely {{were extremely}} inaccurate. There had been heavy fighting in northern Vietnam, where the Vietminh {{were at their}} strongest, and many people had been forced <b>to</b> <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> homes. Although French charities had been operating in the north, the refugee camps were disorganised {{and were able to}} provide little more than shelter. As a result, there was a great number of northerners who wanted to leave and start a new life in the south.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} was a two-week battle around Tabu-dong and Waegwan {{in which the}} North Koreans were able to gradually push the 1st Cavalry Division back from its lines. However, the North Koreans {{were not able to}} force the US troops to withdraw completely or push the UN out of Taegu. When the UN counterattacked at Inchon, the North Koreans were forced <b>to</b> <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> attack on Tabu-dong.|$|E

5|$|A workhouse {{was built}} in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the {{increasing}} numbers of destitute poor. In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There {{were a couple of}} reasons for this large growth in population. Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry led many <b>to</b> <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan in the hope of gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E
5|$|Although Alabama officially did not {{participate}} {{as part of the}} 1943 college football season, a team composed of 17-year old and draft deferred students was organized as the Alabama Informals in October 1943. Not officially sanctioned by the University, the Informals were allowed to utilize both equipment and the facilities of the Crimson Tide. The team was led by head coach Mitchell Olenski, and John Gresham and Al Alois served as assistant coaches. At the time of its creation, the Alabama Informals squad was the second created by a SEC school forced <b>to</b> <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> football team for the year after Vanderbilt.|$|E
5|$|At 4.00 a.m. on 17 September, Hellenic {{components}} of the 1st Division Group raided mount Preslap, a key position housing Bulgarian artillery. The Greeks rapidly descended from Golo Bilo and then began climbing the cliffs of Preslap with their bare hands. The Preslap garrison proceeded <b>to</b> <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> positions and retreat eastwards. Having lost their artillery cover forces at Zborsko followed their comrades in retreat. The Timok Division conquered Topolets and advanced towards Studena Voda and Preslap while the Morava and Yugoslav Divisions overran Koutskov Kamene. At the same time, the Drina and Danube Divisions seized Gradešnica along with the Poltsista and Besistsa peaks, then halted at Melinitsa.|$|E

5000|$|Meanwhile, the Xenobian trade {{delegation}} {{contact the}} factory {{to arrange a}} demonstration of the [...] "one-way plough" [...] that Dickinson had been working on. Miss Cooper invites Dickinson to attend, but he merely watches from a distance through binoculars. The Xenobians are impressed and order 800 ploughs for £50,000. After the contract is signed, Adam insists the only way to fulfill such a large order is to focus their efforts solely on the plough, to the exclusion of work they have already contracted for from longtime customers. Morris returns to the factory floor rather than be a party <b>to</b> <b>abandoning</b> <b>their</b> other customers. Adam takes his place.|$|R
50|$|However, as {{it turned}} out, the Government of Finland and Karelian {{supporters}} of independence were not going <b>to</b> completely <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> claims. 10 December 1920 in Vyborg the Karelian united government was created, which, {{in addition to the}} Provisional Government of Karelia, became the Olonets government and other national education.|$|R
5|$|Casey {{and some}} members of his staff came ashore on A-Day; the advance echelon of his ASCOM {{headquarters}} arrived two days later. Work began immediately on the airfield at Tacloban, and commenced on airfields in central Leyte soon after they were captured. Heavy seasonal rains thwarted attempts to develop the airbases in central Leyte and it was decided <b>to</b> <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> development and construct a new airbase on the coast at a site occupied by Sixth Army headquarters. The need to get aircraft based on Leyte to stop the Japanese from reinforcing the island was so pressing that Lieutenant General Walter Krueger agreed to move his headquarters.|$|E
5|$|During the Polish–Russian War of 1792 in Defense of the Constitution, the Polish forces {{supporting}} the Constitution, {{fought against the}} army of the Russian Empire, invited by the pro-Russian alliance of Polish magnates, known as the treasonous Targowica Confederation. The conservative nobility (see also, szlachta) believed that the Russians would help them restore their Golden Liberty. Abandoned by their Prussian allies, the badly outnumbered Polish pro-Constitution forces fought under Prince Józef Poniatowski a defensive war with some measure of success, but were ordered <b>to</b> <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> efforts by their supreme commander, King Stanisław August Poniatowski. The King decided to join the Targowica Confederation, as demanded by the Russians.|$|E

5|$|Independent Maya {{frequently}} attacked Christianised Maya {{settlements and}} encouraged such settlements <b>to</b> <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> new religion and resist the Spanish. As Spanish military expeditions were launched against the Maya with increasing frequency, independent Maya communities began to request {{the presence of}} missionaries to avoid armed conflict. The Itza attempted to use neighbouring Maya groups, such as the Yalain, as a buffer against Spanish encroachment; they may also have instigated rebellions by neighbouring groups that were already undergoing incorporation into the Spanish Empire. With Spanish attempts to penetrate the region divided between mutually independent colonial authorities in Yucatán and Guatemala, at times the Itza would be making peaceful overtures on one front while fighting on the other.|$|E

Soviet attempts to sever the narrow salient were unsuccessful, and Totenkopf completed its withdrawal by nightfall.|$|E
5|$|The American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) is also {{native to}} the region and has been {{designated}} as endangered since 1975. Unlike their relatives the alligators, crocodiles tend to thrive in brackish or salt-water habitats such as estuarine or marine coasts. Their most significant threat is disturbance by people. Too much contact with humans causes females <b>to</b> <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> nests, and males in particular are often victims of vehicle collisions while roaming over large territories and attempting to cross U.S. 1 and Card Sound Road in the Florida Keys. There are an estimated 500 to 1,000crocodiles in southern Florida.|$|E
