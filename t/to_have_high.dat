5|$|In chemistry, a nonmetal (or non-metal) is a {{chemical}} element that mostly lacks metallic attributes. Physically, nonmetals {{tend to be}} highly volatile (easily vaporized), have low elasticity, and are good insulators of heat and electricity; chemically, they tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>high</b> ionization energy and electronegativity values, and gain or share electrons when they react with other elements or compounds. Seventeen elements are generally classified as nonmetals; most are gases (hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, chlorine, argon, krypton, xenon and radon); one is a liquid (bromine), and a few are solids (carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, selenium, and iodine).|$|E

5|$|The United States Military Academy (USMA) is an {{undergraduate}} college in West Point, New York {{with the mission}} of educating and commissioning officers for the United States Army. The list is drawn from non-graduate former cadets and cadet candidates. It {{is not unusual for}} the service academies <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>high</b> dropout rates. Of the original 103 cadets in the Class of 1826, only 43 graduated. Non-graduates of the Academy have entered a variety of fields. Notable non-graduates include Edgar Allan Poe (literature), James Abbott McNeill Whistler (art), Maynard James Keenan (music), Adam Vinatieri (football), and even the military: Jacob Zeilin, Lewis Addison Armistead, and Courtney Hodges.|$|E

5|$|In a {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA published in 2012, the Newfoundland pony and Canadian horse {{were found to be}} the most genetically diverse of the Canadian breeds studied, which also included the Sable Island horse and the Lac La Croix pony. When an estimation was made using microsatellite loci, the Newfoundland was found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>high</b> autosomal diversity and a high number of haplotypes, some of which overlapped with the mountain and moorland pony breeds (historically documented as the ancestors of the Newfoundland), Nordic breeds and a feral population at Saint-Pierre et Miquelon. Overlapping haplotypes also suggested a relationship with the Standardbred and Clydesdale, suggesting possible crossbreeding at some point, although previous studies using microsatellite markers had not come to this conclusion. Although the microsatellite loci showed a relationship between the Newfoundland and the Sable Island horse, the study did not find overlapping haplotypes that would support this, possibly due to the population bottleneck in the 1980s that may have resulted in such haplotypes being lost. In order to be registered with the Newfoundland Pony Society, ponies must undergo DNA testing to verify Newfoundland parentage.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{typically}} coexist peacefully {{with other}} herbivores, which will usually {{stay out of}} their way. Some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded. At Aberdare National Park, Kenya, a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other elephants in the group. At Hluhluwe–Umfolozi Game Reserve, South Africa, introduced young orphan elephants went on a killing spree that {{claimed the lives of}} 36 rhinos during the 1990s, but ended with the introduction of older males. The size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators, though there are rare reports of adult elephants falling prey to tigers. Calves may be preyed on by lions, spotted hyenas, and wild dogs in Africa and tigers in Asia. The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting juvenile elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. Elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller ones like leopards (which have not been recorded killing calves); the latter they react less fearfully and more aggressively to. Elephants tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>high</b> numbers of parasites, particularly nematodes, compared to other herbivores. This is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{cross-sectional}} study of 189 community-dwelling persons with {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI) (a) assessed levels of dietary and serum lipids, (b) determined the proportion of persons whose levels were out of the recommended/desired range, and (c) iden-tified predictors of dietary and serum lipids. Lipid levels were out of range for a substantial proportion of the sample. Older persons were likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> serum cholesterol and higher triglyc-eride levels than younger persons. Men tended <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> intake of dietary cholesterol and lower levels of HDL than women. Caucasians and Hispanic-Americans tended <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> triglycerides than African-Americans. Persons who had lived with SCI less time tended <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> saturated fat intake and higher triglycerides than those who had lived with it longer. Greater saturated fat intake was associated with higher serum cholesterol after controlling for age. Studies are needed that test the effectiveness of various interventions on controlling dietary and serum lipids for persons with SCI...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether professional developmen t a nd collaboration practices are a ffected by performance pay in schools. The study investigated the differences in perceptions of principals, veteran teachers, and beginning teachers. S ix questions and statements were posed relating to both professional development and collaboration. Based on the findings, no significant difference in perception of professional development and collaboration exists between educators currently utilizing a compensation model and those not utilizing a compensation model. Second, where a compensation model was implemented, principals were predicted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> levels of agreement regarding their views on professional development. Additionally, beginnin g teachers were predicted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> levels of agreement regarding their views on professional development than veteran teachers. Third, where a compensation model was not implemented, principals were predicted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> levels of agreement regar ding their views on professional development. Also, beginning teachers were predicted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> levels of agreement regarding professional development than veteran teachers.
