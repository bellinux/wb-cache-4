40|$|High-energy (3 ̆e 1. 6 MeV) {{electrons}} create acceptors and donors in single-crystal ZnO. Greater {{damage is}} observed for irradiation in the [0001] direction (Zn face) {{than in the}} [000] direction (O face). The major annealing stage occurs at about 300 – 325  °C, and is much sharper for defects produced by Zn-face irradiation, than for those resulting from O-face irradiation. The defects appear <b>to</b> have a <b>chain</b> <b>character,</b> rather than being simple, near-neighbor vacancy/interstitial Frenkel pairs. These experiments suggest that ZnO is significantly more “radiation hard” than Si, GaAs, or GaN, and should be useful for applications in high-irradiation environments, such as electronics in space satellites...|$|R
50|$|The tag team {{element of}} the game is heavily emphasized, with players being able to switch between the two {{characters}} in their team in a variety of manners. Switch Cancel allows players to switch partners {{in the middle of a}} combo, whilst Cross Rush combos involve launching the opponent into the air before swapping partners and continuing the combo. Cross Arts, which require a full Cross Gauge, allows players <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> together each <b>character's</b> Super Combo in one straight attack, whilst the Cross Assault mechanic allows players to simultaneously control both characters in their team until the Cross Gauge runs out.|$|R
40|$|Since {{decision}} makers’ bounded rationality would impact {{supply chain}} performance, {{it is necessary}} to explore how the individual decisions work in the supply chain. This paper investigates bullwhip effect variation and service level tendency while the decisions are made by different decision makers. Based on the existing study results, the paper establishes a system dynamics model of supply <b>chain</b> conforming <b>to</b> modern supply <b>chain</b> <b>characters.</b> In the model, two adjustment parameters are adopted to describe individual differences in decision makers. The simulation result demonstrates that the behavioral adjustment with different extent results in different supply chain performance. The impact of two parameters is very different. The decision makers should try to avoid the overadjustment to the scarcity of supply from their upstream member...|$|R
40|$|First-principles density-functional {{calculations}} {{reveal that}} aluminum can form planar chains in zigzag and ladder structures. The most stable one has equilateral triangular geometry with four nearest neighbors; the other stable zigzag structure has wide bond angle {{and allows for}} two nearest neighbors. An intermediary structure has the ladder geometry and is formed by two strands. While all these planar geometries are more favored energetically than the linear chain, the binding becomes even stronger in nonplanar geometries. We found that by going from bulk <b>to</b> a <b>chain</b> the <b>character</b> of bonding changes and acquires directionality. The conductance of zigzag and linear chains is 4 e 2 /h under ideal ballistic conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{segmentation}} of degraded characters is {{a challenging}} problem. A lot of {{optical character recognition}} systems remain weak in this problem. Broken and touching characters {{are two types of}} degradation that one encounters frequently in the old documents, in newspapers where the writing is very condensed, etc. We propose therefore in this article very efficient techniques {{to solve the problem of}} segmentation and recognition of broken and touching characters. These techniques use several mathematical tools as Fuzzy Logic or statistics. An algorithm regrouping all these techniques is exposed at the end of this article. Based on an approach by cooperation between classification and segmentation, our algorithm succeed <b>to</b> treat <b>chains</b> of <b>characters</b> either constituted of a certain number of broken/touching characters without a priori knowledge of the width of characters nor their number...|$|R
40|$|Isotactic {{polypropylene}} was crystallized in {{the form}} of fibrous crystals from solution under shearing stress. The fibrous crystals consist of the oriented cluster of micro fibrils. From the electron microscopy and the electron diffraction study, {{it was found that the}} fine texture of this fibrous crystals is also the two component systems which are composed of the central threads with an extended <b>chain</b> <b>character</b> and the lamellae with a folded <b>chain</b> <b>character</b> deposited on the threads, as in polyethylene. Relatively larger lamellar structure than that of polyethylene was observed. The effect of crystallization conditions to the formation of the fibrous crystals from solution of isotactic polypropylene was described briefly. A characteristic melting behavior due to the melting of the central threads with an extended <b>chain</b> <b>character</b> was observed from the thermogram of differential scanning calorimeter...|$|R
40|$|We {{tried to}} clarify the {{crystallization}} mechanism of long chain polymers in solution under shearing stress using polyethylene. From the bright and dark field electron microscope observations and the electron diffraction study, we demonstrated that the resulting fibrous crystals consist of the central threads with an extended <b>chain</b> <b>character</b> and the lamellae with a folded <b>chain</b> <b>character</b> nucleated on the threads. The measurements of thermal and mechanical properties gave the additional confirmation for this suggestion. From these results we discussed the crystallization mechanism on the fibrous crystals...|$|R

Furthermore, we demonstrate this material is substantially structurally untwinned at ambient pressure with the formation of spin rotation walls (S-walls). Finally, in addition to the central-hole and corner-electron Fermi pockets usually appearing in Fe pnictide superconductors, angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements resolve a Fermiology where an extra electron pocket of mainly As <b>chain</b> <b>character</b> exists at the Brillouin zone edge.

40|$|A {{study of}} {{certain aspects of}} the {{photosynthesis}} of hydrogen chloride has been made. In this study particular attention has been given to the following points: the temperature coefficients of the light absorption and of the quantum yield, for different wave-lengths; the so-called photochemical threshold; the variation of quantum yield with light intensity; and the effect of the walls on the <b>chain</b> <b>character</b> ot the reaction. Two general methods were employed in attacking the problem. The first was a modified Bunsen-RoscoeTechnique.

The analysed crystals showed a narrow size range (~ 1467 nm) with an average diameter of 46 : 6. 8 nm, cuboctahedral morphologies and typical Gamma type crystal size distributions.

From the Fellhorn to the Widderstein, there is a ridge in front of the main chain, which terminates in a semicircle at the head of the Kleines Walsertal valley. The mountain <b>chain</b> <b>character</b> of the Allgäu Alps is interrupted by the Ifen and the Gottesacke Plateau (Cretaceous rocks). Here a karst plateau has been formed - uniquely for the Allgäu Alps and beyond. Further north the Flysch Mountains again form small chains. This is followed by Nagelfluh chain which is made of molasse. This is the most attractive molasse mountain range sculpted in the entire Alps. The lower mountains further north also form small chains.|$|R
