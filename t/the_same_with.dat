5|$|After {{just over}} an hour, Gemmell {{finally managed to}} equalise for Celtic when Craig passed {{to him from the}} right wing and he scored with a {{powerful}} 25 yard shot. The balance of play remained <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> Inter defending deeply against sustained Celtic attacking. With about five minutes remaining, a long-range shot from Bobby Murdoch was diverted by Stevie Chalmers past a wrong-footed Sarti. This proved to be the winning goal.|$|E
5|$|After {{the player}} completes {{the game with}} either the bad ending or the best ending, Julius Mode is unlocked, similar to the Julius Mode in Aria of Sorrow. Julius Mode, in storyline terms, follows the {{assumption}} that Soma succumbed to his dark power, and became the new dark lord. A new game can then be started {{from the main menu}} in Julius Mode. In Julius Mode, the playable characters include Julius Belmont, Yoko Belnades, and Alucard. Each character has a weapon and an assortment of abilities unique to them, and although these abilities remain static throughout the entire game, the characters' statistics can improve by acquiring enough experience points to level up. The castle layout and enemies are <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> <b>with</b> the exception of the final battle, which is against Soma.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} proper, Lewis Hamilton {{was able to}} hold his lead, while his {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg tried to attack Sebastian Vettel in second place. This opened up the opportunity for the second Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen {{to go around the}} outside of the Mercedes and take third. Hamilton tried to open up a gap in order to cover his position, should the Ferrari drivers attempt a so-called undercut, a strategy in which a car entered the pit lane early in order to use fresher tyres to get in front of another car without overtaking them on track. Meanwhile, Rosberg took back third from Räikkönen on lap four before doing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> Vettel on the end of lap nine.|$|E

5|$|Beginning with Du Cange, many earlier historians {{distinguished}} between two persons of this name, since the sources record that a minor noble named Constantine Angelos, from Philadelphia, married the fourth daughter of Alexios I Komnenos {{and received the}} title of pansebastohypertatos, whereas the Constantine Angelos, uncle of Manuel I and active during the latter's reign, is recorded in the sources as a sebastohypertatos. However, in 1961 Lucien Stiernon demonstrated that the two persons are in fact <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> <b>with</b> pansebastohypertatos being merely a rhetorical augmentation of the proper title.|$|E
5|$|Behind the scenes, Welensky and the Rhodesians {{had been}} courting the Conservatives, while the native Africans {{had been doing}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> Labour. A British general {{election}} was held in 1951 and the Conservatives gained power. Labour, mindful of the overwhelming opposition of Africans from both Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and of the Colonial Office mandate to oversee native interests, had been lukewarm at best {{to the idea of}} federation, and had been wholly opposed to amalgamation. After the election, the bipartisan approach to federation broke down and the British laws for its creation passed only {{with the support of the}} Conservatives, with both Liberal and Labour Parties now opposed.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to emphasise good {{relations}} with the white settlers, in August 1963 Kenyatta met with 300 white farmers at Nakuru. He reassured them that they would be safe and welcome in an independent Kenya, and more broadly talked of forgiving and forgetting the conflicts of the past. Despite his attempts at wooing white support, he did not do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> the Indian minority. Like many indigenous Africans in Kenya, Kenyatta bore a sense of resentment towards this community, despite the role that many Indians had played in securing the country's independence. He also encouraged the remaining Mau Mau fighters to leave the forests and settle in society. However, throughout Kenyatta's rule, many of these individuals would remain unemployed, with unemployment being one of the most persistent problems facing his government.|$|E

5|$|In 1629, Edward Hyde {{married his}} first wife, Anne Ayliffe of Grittenham. Six {{months into the}} {{marriage}} Anne caught smallpox, miscarried and died. Three years later, Hyde married Frances Aylesbury. In 1637, Anne, the couple's eldest daughter, was born at Cranbourne Lodge in Windsor. Almost nothing except that she was named after Edward Hyde's first wife is known of her life before 1649, when her family fled to the Netherlands after {{the execution of the}} deposed King Charles I. They settled in Breda, where they were offered a home by Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, who had done <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> many English fugitives. The Princess appointed Anne a maid of honour, apparently against the wishes of her mother and late father.|$|E
5|$|In post-production, Embassy's self-imposed role {{in making}} Crimewave was even greater. Although Raimi, Tapert, and Campbell {{insisted that they}} had made the film as partners, the studio refused — because of the already {{ballooning}} costs — to pay for Campbell to stay in Los Angeles during post-production (although the executives later compromised). The studio replaced Raimi's music composer, Joseph LoDuca, with {{one of its own}} choosing. It did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> the editor, removing Raimi's influence over the film's final cut.|$|E

Toby points out to Jim {{that it is}} not fair to tell Pam that he needs an indeterminate amount of time before Athlead pays off for the family; Pam vents to Nellie that Jim is always making unilateral decisions involving her and they each agree they are not leaving Philly for Scranton or vice versa. The Halperts leave the office looking sad and awkward together.|$|E
5|$|Murder on the Orient Express was {{announced}} in May 2006, as the second installment in The Adventure Company's Agatha Christie series. As with the game's predecessor, And Then There Were None, Murder on the Orient Express was developed by AWE Productions, in collaboration with producer The Adventure Company. The production team remained largely <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> <b>with</b> Lee Sheldon reprising his role as Lead Designer, and Scott Nixon from AWE Productions reprising his position as Managing Director.|$|E
5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural unit , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very {{high melting point}} {{makes it difficult to}} mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with sulfonic acid groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; polyvinylidene fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.|$|E

She and her boyfriend Pat Jenkins (Lachlan Jeffrey) spend a few weeks together until she realises {{it is not going to}} work out, he leaves her. Her friends Jai Fernandez (Jordan Rodrigues) and Annie, who are in a relationship, make her feel lonely so she convinces herself she loves Miles. When her father Ross Buckton is diagnosed with Alzheimer's, she finds it hard to cope. She contacts - via the internet - classmate Matthew Lyons (Ross Pirelli), a wayward teenager, and reveals he is experiencing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> his grandmother. When she finds out it is Matthew, she thinks he has lied and photographs him undressed and displays them. She then realises he was telling the truth, he would not forgive her and decides to exact revenge.|$|E

They also held numerous tag team titles together.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} {{of both the}} car and Webber, who had certainly worked well to out-qualify his vastly more experienced teammate, was highlighted by the closeness they had to other teams which ran the Renault engine and although the Adrian Newey-designed car had flaws which contributed to Webber's scoreless season to that point. Though {{the pace of the}} car seemed to be picking up, with Coulthard qualifying in the top-10 for the , Webber was unable to convert his early weekend pace into a competitive grid position due to hydraulic problems. His race was much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> a similar hydraulic problem leading to him retiring early in the race whilst teammate Coulthard notched up the team's first points with a fifth-place finish.|$|E

5|$|These crowns {{continue}} {{a history of}} monarchy in the Americas that reaches back to before European colonization. Both tribal and more complex pre-Columbian societies existed under monarchical forms of government, with some expanding to form vast empires under a central king figure, while others did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> a decentralized collection of tribal regions under a hereditary chieftain. None of the contemporary monarchies, however, are descended from those pre-colonial royal systems, instead either having their historical roots in, or still being a part of, the current European monarchies that spread their reach across the Atlantic Ocean, beginning in the mid 14th century.|$|E
