40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide some general recommendations for selecting a befitting beverage to accompany chocolates with different cocoa contents. Eighteen beverages and three chocolates with 30 %, 70 %, and 99 % cocoa solids were hedonically rated by eighty regular chocolate consumers. The beverages were then paired with each chocolate, and the consumers were asked to indicate hedonic liking of the chocolates, beverages, and chocolate and beverage pairs, and to indicate whether the chocolate or beverage flavour dominated the pair. The results of this study showed that liking of chocolate and beverage pairs significantly varied (p < 0. 001). Consumers preferred pairs with chocolate containing 30 and 70 % cocoa solids over pairs with chocolate containing 99 % cocoa solids. Beverages, such as balsamic vinegar, liqueur wine, coffee, and Port wine, generally appeared to be more proper and versatile partners for chocolate. According to the factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA), the chocolate and beverage pair liking depended more on the beverage liking than the chocolate liking and the level of match. Omega squared indicated a medium effect for the beverage liking and a small effect for the chocolate liking, and the level of match. Although exploratory, this study outlined that when chocolate dominated the pair, a drop in acceptance is generally observed, whereas when the beverage dominates the chocolate a drop or a gain in acceptance can occur. Further investigations are required to complement the results with specific pieces of information on the flavour interactions that occur when chocolate and beverages are consumed according to a mixed <b>tasting</b> <b>technique...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} characterize, from sensorial point of view, the basic white wines White Fetească, Italian Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, {{as well as}} flavored wines and vermouth type wines, {{obtained}} by addition of hydroalcoholic plants macerates to basic wines, <b>tasting</b> <b>technique</b> was used. It is known that sensory analysis is a method that can {{provide an overview of}} a wine. The main features analyzed were: appearance, color, smell and taste. Initial, wines presented specific features of grapes variety from which they belong, being characterized by harmony and complex flavor. The hydroalcoholic macerates were obtained by preparing two recipes (labeled I and II) of different mixtures of plants. Recipes I A in 45 % alcohol and I B in 60 % alcohol, had characteristics of appearance, color, taste and smell, very intense, specific, prevailing the taste of anise, fennel and coriander. The macerates prepared with recipes II A in 45 % alcohol and II B in 60 % alcohol (mixture of a few herbs and peel of citrus fruits) showed peculiarities of taste, odor, flavor less intense, prevailing the smell of nutmeg and citrus flavor. Recipes I A and I B of hydroalcoholic plants macerates decisively influenced the color, taste, flavor, smell and appearance of flavored wines. Recipes II A and II B influenced discreetly the sensory properties of flavored wines. Vermouth type wines obtained by addition of hydroalcoholic plants macerates + other ingredients (citric acid, alcohol, sugar), presented harmonious sensory characteristics, balanced, discreet, subtle, compared with flavored wines obtained only by the addition of hydroalcoholic plants macerates to the basic wines. The latter had a color, aroma, taste, smell, more intense, more rustic. Herbal recipes I B and II B (prepared in 60 % alcohol), have strongly influenced the sensory properties of flavored wines, compared to recipes I A and II A (prepared in 45 % alcohol) ...|$|E

In {{present study}} total 75 patients with appendicitis were selected, 40 of which underwent SIOA(small incision open appendicectomy) and 35 underwent LA(laparoscopic appendicectomy). SIOA was done via 2 - 3 cm incision at McBurney’s point and LA was done via standard 3 port technique. Both the technique were compared {{in terms of}} operative time, post-operative pain, analgesic requirement, post-operative length of stay, time to return to daily activities, complications, conversion rate, cost and cosmetic outcome. The results showed that SIOA is better than LA in terms of operative time (mean 44. 41 vs. 56. 44 minutes), time to return to daily activity (mean 8. 22 vs. 9. 13 days) and complications (6. 66 % vs. 10 %).

Solid state formulations such as mini tabs have a limitation in that they still lack the dosing accuracy needed for dosing the very young patient less than 1  year of age where liquid formulations are preferred for ease of administration as well as accuracy of dosing since dosing in this group of patients is generally weight based and often results in fractional dosing. This leads to continual need for extemporaneous compounding for this patient population.|$|R

Acceptable palatability of oral paediatric medicinal products is of great importance to facilitate patient adherence.

30|$|Micro- and {{nanostructures}} with three-dimensional (3 D) shapes {{are needed}} {{for a variety of}} applications in optics and fluidics where structures with both smooth and sharp features enhance the performance and functionality. We present a novel method for the generation of true 3 D surfaces based on thermally activated selective topography equilibration (<b>TASTE).</b> This <b>technique</b> allows generating almost arbitrary sloped, convex and concave profiles in the same polymer film with dimensions in micro- and nanometer scale. We describe its principal mechanism exemplified by pre-patterned poly (methyl methacrylate) resist which is exposed to high energy electrons prior to a thermal annealing step enabling the selective transformation of stepped contours into smooth surfaces. From this we conclude, that TASTE not only offers an enormous degree of freedom for future process variations, but also will advance the patterning capabilities of current standard 3 D micro- and nanofabrication methods.|$|R

2500|$|A {{significant}} percentage of military brats report difficulty in forming strong relations with people or places, but very often do form strong connections with (or in some cases aversion to) {{the notion of a}} military base and the communities in which they find themselves. This is because the knowledge, experience, values, ideas, attitudes, skills, <b>tastes,</b> and <b>techniques</b> that are associated with the military can sometimes differ from civilian culture. Military bases are miniature, self-contained, government-subsidized towns that promote conformity. Military families shop at some of the same stores, whose discounted merchandise is regulated to prevent unfair competition, so they can often end up with the same clothes and products. Male brats were, at one time, likely to get the same [...] "military haircut" [...] at the base barbershop, but this has changed over time. To a child growing up on a military base, in a homogeneous culture, the individuality of civilian life was once thought to be completely foreign. However, as the individual children have attended civilian schools near base and socialized with their peers, this perceived difference may have reduced to varying degrees.|$|R
