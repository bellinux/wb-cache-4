5|$|Children and infants may {{be unable}} to report being bitten, making it {{difficult}} to associate their symptoms with a spider bite. Symptoms seen in infants include inconsolable crying, refusing <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> a general erythematous rash. Muscle aches and pains, and neck spasm are often seen in children over four years of age.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{returning}} {{north in}} spring across the central Mediterranean appear {{to follow a}} well-defined route. Large concentrations of ruffs form every year at particular stopover sites <b>to</b> <b>feed,</b> <b>and</b> individuals marked with rings or dye reappear in subsequent years. The refuelling sites are closer together than the theoretical maximum travel distance calculated from the mean body mass, and provide evidence of a migration strategy using favoured intermediate sites. The ruff stores fat as a fuel, but unlike mammals, uses lipids as {{the main energy source}} for exercise (including migration) and, when necessary, keeps warm by shivering; however, little research has been conducted on the mechanisms by which they oxidise lipids.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves filter {{large amounts}} of water <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> breathe {{but they are not}} {{permanently}} open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, even when they are permanently submerged. In oysters, for example, their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and circadian rhythms according to the relative positions of the moon and sun. During neap tides, they exhibit much longer closing periods than during spring tides.|$|E

5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} three to over thirty years. Ripe gametes (ova or sperm) float from the gonads into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity. The larvae of inarticulate brachiopods are {{miniature}} adults, with lophophores that enable the larvae <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> swim for months until the animals become heavy enough to settle to the seabed. The planktonic larvae of articulate species do not resemble the adults, but rather look like blobs with yolk sacs, and remain among the plankton {{for only a few}} days before leaving the water column upon metamorphosing.|$|E
5|$|Sponges are {{worldwide}} in their distribution, {{living in a}} wide range of ocean habitats, from the polar regions to the tropics. Most live in quiet, clear waters, because sediment stirred up by waves or currents would block their pores, making it difficult for them <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> breathe. The greatest numbers of sponges are usually found on firm surfaces such as rocks, but some sponges can attach themselves to soft sediment by means of a root-like base.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of each colossal head {{must have been}} carefully planned, given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available; {{it seems likely that}} only the more powerful Olmec rulers were able to mobilise such resources. The workforce would have included sculptors, labourers, overseers, boatmen, woodworkers and other artesans producing the tools to make and move the monument, in addition to the support needed <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> otherwise attend to these workers. The seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the {{production of}} the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end.|$|E

50|$|The phytosaur skull was {{characterized}} by three distinct morphotypes, which relate <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> habits and not (as was once thought) evolutionary relationships. These skull patterns are linked to characteristics of the dentition; specifically the differentiation or similarity of the teeth along the jaws.|$|R
5|$|Young {{birds have}} a yellowish-red gape. The feather follicles {{appear on the}} fourth day and pin {{feathers}} emerge after a week. Nestlings increase in weight steadily until they are 12 days old. The eyes open on the eighth day, the iris reddish-black while the gape turns red. The young leave the nest after about 16 to 20 days after hatching. They do not have the fork in the tail until three weeks. The parents continue <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> protect them for a month. Young birds may beg for food for longer, but are often ignored or chased away by the adults. Birds reach breeding condition in about two years.|$|E
5|$|Public {{attitudes towards}} feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against {{diseases such as}} rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Imerina was governed through {{a mixture of}} traditional practices and innovative measures. While all land technically belonged to the sovereign, its administration {{was carried out by}} andriana who were assigned a menakely (subdivision of land) to govern. These administrators were themselves overseen by roving royal advisers. The land was cultivated by commoners, who were given a parcel to farm based {{on the size of the}} family it was meant <b>to</b> <b>feed,</b> <b>and</b> each family paid taxes to the king in return. Andrianampoinimerina passed laws giving children the right to claim meat from the butcher that had not been sold by the day's end, and allowing the poor to eat cassava from others' fields, provided they took only what they could cook and consume on the spot. In this way, the basic nutritional needs of most citizens were met.|$|E

5|$|With longitudinal, {{transverse}} and radial muscles, polyps {{are able}} to elongate and shorten, bend and twist, inflate and deflate, and extend and contract their tentacles. Most polyps extend <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> contract when disturbed, often invaginating their oral discs and tentacles into the column. Contraction is achieved by pumping fluid out of the coelenteron, and reflation by drawing it in, a task performed by the siphonoglyphs in the pharynx which are lined with beating cilia. Most anthozoans adhere to the substrate with their pedal discs but some {{are able to}} detach themselves and move about, while others burrow into the sediment. Movement may be a passive drifting with the currents {{or in the case}} of sea anemones, may involve creeping along a surface on their base.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} over the warmer months with eggs laid from August to January. The clutch is laid {{on a bed of}} wood dust or leaves and {{consists}} of two to five (or rarely up to eight) round or oval glossy white eggs, each of which is generally 21 to 22mm long by 18mm (0.8 by 0.7in) wide. Clutches tend to have more eggs in earlier rather than later clutches, and in nests located further from cleared land. Eggs are laid at an interval of two to three days. Incubation takes 18 to 21 days. The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and feeds them for their first few days before the male begins helping. She leaves <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> drink twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Both parents take part in feeding the young, on a diet predominantly of seeds with some fruit. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless and blind and remain in the nest for an extended period. Covered in silvery-white down, they have pink skin and darker blue-grey skin around the eye. By seven days they open their eyes, and are well-covered in grey down with pin feathers emerging from their wings on day six. They are almost covered in feathers by day 21, and fledge (leave the nest) at around 23days of age in the wild and up to 30days of age in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Marta, a black gray wolf, is alpha {{female in}} a small pack in Pleasant Valley, Montana, that {{consists}} of her mate, Calef, their three pups Rann, Sula, and Annie, and a seven-year-old wolf named Oldtooth. One morning Calef is killed by poachers, leaving Marta and Oldtooth to try <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> raise the pups on their own. Though an experienced hunter, Oldtooth is unable to bring down large game as he lost most of his teeth chewing a steel leg trap off his leg years ago. Once the cubs {{are old enough to}} be left alone for short periods of time, Marta takes over the bulk of the hunting. Though it is difficult, the two adults successfully keep all three cubs alive and begin weaning them and teaching them the ways of the wolf. In the summer, traps begin appearing in the area as human populations increase. Annie and Sula are caught and are taken away by humans, but reappear a few days later, locked in cages. Marta tries to free her pups but is unsuccessful; however humans come regularly to keep them fed and ensure they have water. Oldtooth is later captured, while Marta is tranquilized from a helicopter. Rann escapes and is not seen again.|$|E

5|$|Some frogs {{protect their}} {{offspring}} inside their own bodies. Both {{male and female}} pouched frogs (Assa darlingtoni) guard their eggs, which are laid on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in the egg mass. The tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side, where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frogs. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus sp.) from Australia, now probably extinct, swallows her fertilized eggs, which then develop inside her stomach. She ceases <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> stops secreting stomach acid. The tadpoles rely on the yolks of the eggs for nourishment. After six or seven weeks, they are ready for metamorphosis. The mother regurgitates the tiny frogs, which hop away from her mouth. The female Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii) from Chile lays up to 40 eggs on the ground, where they are guarded by the male. When the tadpoles are about to hatch, they are engulfed by the male, which carries them around inside his much-enlarged vocal sac. Here they are immersed in a frothy, viscous liquid that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from the yolks of the eggs. They remain in the sac for seven to ten weeks before undergoing metamorphosis, after which they move into the male's mouth and emerge.|$|E
