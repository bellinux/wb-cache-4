Out of the many characters for which Azaria provides the voice, Frink is his favorite to do {{because he was a}} fan of Lewis in his younger years and he enjoys imitating the voice of the nutty professor. He has said that [...] "once you start talking like [...] it’s very hard to stop. On each take, I’ll make it sillier, I always have. I’ll add more and more stupid noises and sounds to it. If <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> keep going, it gets ridiculous." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Yankovic {{undertook}} the 70-city [...] "Stupid Tour"; this was his biggest tour of the 1980s, and featured [...] "costume changes, carefully designed lighting, and several of Al's videos cleverly integrated into the stage show". Yankovic's on-stage wardrobe changed dramatically during the tour, and he specifically stipulated that every promoter [...] "had to supply one garish Hawaiian shirt" [...] for him to wear. Yankovic eventually acquired [...] "a couple closets full" [...] of them. Yankovic also started wearing exclusively Vans, and joked that [...] "whenever I need some <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go to their warehouse and take home an armload." ...|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers behind Twilight {{worked to}} create a film that was as {{faithful}} to the novel as they thought possible when converting the story to another medium, with producer Greg Mooradian saying, [...] "It's very important to distinguish that we're making a separate piece of art that obviously is going to remain very, very faithful to the book.... But at the same time, we have a separate responsibility {{to make the best}} movie you can make." [...] To ensure a faithful adaptation, Meyer was kept very involved in the production process, having been invited to visit the set during filming and even asked to give notes on the script and on a rough cut of the film. Of this process, she said, [...] "It was a really pleasant exchange [...] from the beginning, which I think is not very typical. They were really interested in my ideas", and, [...] "...they kept me in the loop and with the script, <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> see it and said, 'What are your thoughts?'... <b>They</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have input on it and I think they took 90 percent of what I said and just incorporated it right in to the script." [...] Meyer fought for one line in particular, one of the most well-known from the book about [...] "the lion and the lamb", to be kept verbatim in the film: [...] "I actually think the way Melissa [...] wrote it sounded better for the movie [...] {{but the problem is that}} line is actually tattooed on peoples' bodies [...] But I said, 'You know, if you take that one and change it, that's a potential backlash situation. Meyer was even invited {{to create a}} written list of things that could not be changed for the film, such as giving the vampires fangs or killing characters who do not die in the book, that the studio agreed to follow. The consensus among critics is that the filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is very faithful to its source material, with one reviewer stating that, with a few exceptions, [...] "Twilight the movie is unerringly faithful to the source without being hamstrung by it." ...|$|E

500|$|In the video, Dev {{is seen in}} a club {{scene with}} intense dancing. The main focus is black-painted hands and arms, which are {{prominent}} in several shots of Dev as she is standing naked while the hands are touching her body. Some of the hands were digitally added, {{but the majority of}} them were real, including the ones touching Dev. She explained, [...] "The extras were amazing, <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> paint their hands and bodies, and they stacked {{on top of each other}} and did that for hours. For takes and takes and takes." [...] The video also includes shots of an albino ball python and a tarantula. Cory Lamz of Westword wrote a positive review of the video: [...] "Watching 'In the Dark' is like dancing under a strobe light on ecstasy. In a sea of hands, literally, Dev manages to tease you, seduce you and entice you. She makes you want to touch her, just like every other hand in the video." [...] Contessa Gayles of AOL Music referred the video to as [...] "freaky" [...] and [...] "funky", writing [...] "Forget 'dancing in the dark,' Dev works it in a sea of dismembered, black-painted hands and arms in this freaky, funky new vid." [...] In contrast, Becky Bain of Idolator called it [...] "somewhat unsettling".|$|E
500|$|... "Rumors" [...] was {{originally}} titled [...] "Just What It Is". The track {{was written by}} Lohan, Cory Rooney, Taryll Jackson, and TJ Jackson. It was also produced by Rooney, who provided keyboards and background vocals. Peter Wade Keusch assisted the production, and was responsible along with Chris Avedon for Lohan's vocal recording, which occurred at the Poolhouse West and The Village Recorder in Los Angeles, California. Audio mixing was done by Keusch at Sony Music Studios in New York, New York. Christopher J. Warner provided the guitar present in the song's composition. It was released as a single on September 21, 2004, through Casablanca Records. [...] "Rumors" [...] is {{in the style of}} contemporary R. Lyrically, the song was written {{as a response to the}} paparazzi and media's backlash, both which are addressed in the chorus lines, where Lohan sings, [...] "I'm tired of rumors starting/ I'm sick of being followed/ I'm tired of people lying/ Saying what they want about me/ Why can't they back up off me?/ Why can't <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> live? I'm going to do it my way/ Take this for just what it is." [...] Spence D. of IGN noted that the singer's vocals are [...] "driven by snarls, breathy croons, and emotionally restrained angst," [...] while John Murphy of musicOMH considered it [...] "a feisty dance anthem with intelligent lyrics attacking the paparazzi and press in general." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hamnett died in 1956 from {{complications}} {{after falling}} out of her apartment window and being impaled on the fence forty feet below.

2500|$|In December 2012, Hart {{embarked}} on a short tour of Ireland with a new lineup, Colm O' Herlihy on guitar, Dan Walsh on drums and Simon Dargan on bass In a recent Facebook Q, Hart commented [...] "I love playing with these guys. <b>They</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> make music rather than getting bogged down administrating a band's business. They make it a joy with their self-starting ways" [...] He confirmed this lineup for his upcoming European and USA dates.

2500|$|In November 1927, after {{receiving}} news that Adolph Joffe had committed suicide, he assigned Ukrainian campaigning to Voja Vujović, {{and returned to}} Moscow. Following {{the defeat of the}} Left Opposition in November–December 1927, Rakovsky was ousted from the Comintern, the Central Committee, and eventually from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He was exiled, first to Astrakhan, Saratov, and then to Barnaul. Shortly before the decision, he commented to his visitor, French writer Pierre Naville: [...] "The French expelled me from Paris for having signed a declaration of the opposition. Stalin expelled me from the [...] for having signed the same declaration. But in both cases <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> keep the jacket".|$|E

2500|$|Brian {{believed}} {{the band was}} worried about him separating from the group, elaborating that [...] "it was generally considered that the Beach Boys were the main thing... with Pet Sounds, there was a resistance in that I was {{doing most of the}} artistic work on it vocally". Love wrote: [...] "I also {{would have liked to have}} had a greater hand in some of the songs and been able to incorporate more often my 'lead voice,' which we'd had so much success with." [...] The conflicts were resolved, according to Brian, [...] " [...] they figured that it was a showcase for Brian Wilson, but it's still the Beach Boys. In other words, they gave in. <b>They</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have my little stint." ...|$|E
2500|$|The chase {{was mostly}} led by [...] while [...] also chipped in. As the lead group {{continued}} to gain time, Busche told his teammate Voigt [...] "you look pretty good, why don't {{you go for}} the stage?". Voigt did exactly that and with [...] to race until the finish line he launched an attack {{that would not be}} nullified. He crossed the line in Avila Beach solo, registering his first victory of the year. The large group of escapees he was part of came in 6 seconds later, and the whole peloton a minute and seven seconds in arrears. The general classification was reshuffled, with Van Garderen taking the lead from Acevedo and Michael Rogers going from fifth to second. 41-year-old veteran Voigt said in his typical good humored fashion when interviewed after his victory: [...] "I just did the same move I've been doing since the ice age, and I couldn't believe <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go. Once I get 20 seconds, I'm gone. I looked back and said, 'I can't believe they're giving me 20 seconds, don't they know?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{expected}} a less personal {{treatment for the}} film and were at times uncomfortable with {{the extent to which}} Guggenheim probed into their history. Responding to the band's concerns, Guggenheim said, [...] "I tell the story that's in front of me, warts and all. In the rock 'n' roll business, it's about adding layers. My process strips layers away. Rock stars are more comfortable creating an aura and mystique." [...] Despite U2's discomfort, they allowed Guggenheim to have creative control over the film. He remarked, [...] "They said from the beginning, we want you to make the movie that you want to make and <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> make the movie I wanted to make. It was pretty astounding. I think part of it is the trust we gained doing It Might Get Loud, they sort of let me have a free hand." [...] Bono said that it was the least involved the band had ever been in a U2 project. Additional filming took place on 27 May at Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg during the band's rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. A rough cut of the movie was shown to the group in July, much to their satisfaction. According to Guggenheim, [...] "They were over the moon. They loved it." [...] The only request the band made was that the film should be shortened in length, and Guggenheim agreed.|$|E
