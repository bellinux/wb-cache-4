5|$|The 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin {{were the}} first Games to be {{broadcast}} on television, though only to local audiences. The 1956 Winter Olympics {{were the first}} internationally televised Olympic Games, and the following Winter Games had their broadcasting rights sold {{for the first time}} to specialised television broadcasting networks—CBS paid US$394,000 for the American rights, and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) allocated US$660,000. In the following decades the Olympics became one of the ideological fronts of the Cold War. Superpowers jockeyed for political supremacy, and the IOC wanted to take advantage of this heightened interest via the broadcast medium. The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games, thereby generating more interest, which in turn created more appeal <b>to</b> <b>advertisers</b> time on television. This cycle allowed the IOC to charge ever-increasing fees for those rights. For example, CBS paid US$375million for the rights of the 1998 Nagano Games, while NBC spent US$3.5billion for the broadcast rights of all the Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{television}} stations were launched, mainly concentrated around {{southern and eastern}} parts of the country. By {{the turn of the}} decade, the takeup of television had increased dramatically – by 1960 up to 70% of homes in Sydney and Melbourne had a television set.

25|$|The last edition {{appeared}} on 16 October 1802. All {{was not lost}} however, as Cornish landowners got a group subscription together, and Flindell offered his services as publisher and printer. The paper re-appeared, published in Truro on 2 July 1803. Two years later it was sold to Nettletons, and Flindell moved to Exeter to set up another newspaper there. The newspaper was mainly subscribed by doctors, bankers, lawyers and landowners, {{but it was also}} made available publicly to inns and guest houses, a process which made it more amenable <b>to</b> <b>advertisers.</b>|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{to better}} take {{advantage}} of the region's pool of writers and directors, Tortorici decided to migrate Telemundo's main base of operations – transferring its programming and management divisions – from Hialeah, Florida to a new facility in Santa Monica, California in December of that year, resulting in the hiring or transfer of approximately 45 employees; more than 300 other employees continued to be based at its Hialeah offices. The changes proved to be disastrous as Telemundo's ratings for the overhauled prime time lineup sharply fell by 42% to an 8% audience share among Latino households against the telenovela-dominated lineup programmed by Univision (which held a roughly 91% share) in that slot by the February 1999 sweeps period; the network was even forced to air numerous commercials for free as part of contractual makegoods <b>to</b> <b>advertisers,</b> resulting in a loss of more than $1 million in potential revenue.|$|E
25|$|The site {{on which}} the Flatiron Building would stand was bought in 1857 by Amos Eno, who shortly built the Fifth Avenue Hotel on a site diagonally across from it. Eno tore down the four-story St. Germaine Hotel on {{the south end of}} the lot, and {{replaced}} it with a seven-story apartment building, the Cumberland. On the remainder of the lot he built four three-story buildings for commercial use. This left four stories of the Cumberland's northern face exposed, which Eno rented out <b>to</b> <b>advertisers,</b> including The New York Times, who installed a sign made up of electric lights. Eno later put a canvas screen on the wall, and projected images onto it from a magic lantern on top of one of his smaller buildings, presenting advertisements and interesting pictures alternately. Both the Times and the New York Tribune began using the screen for news bulletins, and on election nights tens of thousands of people would gather in Madison Square, waiting for the latest results.|$|E

25|$|When {{switching}} {{to the use}} of national teams in 1930, the costs of accommodating riders fell to the organizers instead of the sponsors and Henri Desgrange raised the money by allowing advertisers to precede the race. The procession of often colourfully decorated trucks and cars became known as the publicity caravan. It formalised an existing situation, companies having started to follow the race. The first to sign to precede the Tour was the chocolate company, Menier, one of those who had followed the race. Its head of publicity, Paul Thévenin, had first put the idea to Desgrange. It paid 50,000 old francs. Preceding the race was more attractive <b>to</b> <b>advertisers</b> because spectators gathered by the road long before the race or could be attracted from their houses. Advertisers following the race found that many who had watched the race had already gone home. Menier handed out tons of chocolate in that first year of preceding the race, as well as 500,000 policemen's hats printed with the company's name. The success led to the caravan's existence being formalised the following year.|$|E
25|$|The late 1960s brought {{big changes}} in the {{programming}} practices of the major television networks. As baby boomers reached adulthood, NBC, CBS and ABC {{began to realize that}} much of their existing programming had not only been running for years, but had audiences that skewed older. In order to attract the large youth population that was highly attractive <b>to</b> <b>advertisers,</b> the networks moved to clean house of a number of veteran shows. In NBC's case, this included programs like The Bell Telephone Hour and Sing Along With Mitch, which both had an average viewer age of 50. During this period, the networks came to define adults between the ages of 18 and 49 as their main target audience, although depending on the show, this could be subdivided into other age demos: 35–45, 18–25 or 18–35. Regardless of the exact target demographic, the general idea was to appeal to viewers who were not close to retirement age and to modernize television programming, which the networks felt overall was stuck in a 1950s mentality, to closely resemble contemporary American society.|$|E

500|$|In {{an attempt}} to compete with Twitter's {{leadership}} in TV, Facebook introduced a number of features in 2013 to drive conversation about TV including hashtags, verified profiles and embeddable posts. It also opened up new data visualization APIs for TV news and other media outlets, enabling them {{to search for a}} word and see a firehose of public posts that mention it as well as show how many people mentioned a word in both public and private posts during a set time frame, with a demographic breakdown of the age, gender, and location of these people. In January 2014, Facebook announced a partnership with UK-based social TV analytics company SecondSync which saw the social network make its social TV available outside the company for the first time. Facebook struck the partnership to help marketers understand how people are using the social network to talk about topics such as TV. However, Twitter responded by acquiring SecondSync and Parisian social TV firm Mesagraph three months later. These acquisitions, as well as a partnership with research company Kantar (which it had been working with to develop a suite of analytics tools for the British TV industry since August 2013) strengthened Twitter's dominance of the [...] "second screen" [...] – TV viewers using tablets and smartphones to share their TV experience on social media. With the additional analytic tools, Twitter was able to improve the firm's offering <b>to</b> <b>advertisers,</b> allowing them to, for instance, only promote a tweet onto the timelines of users who were watching a certain programme.|$|E
500|$|Although {{science fiction}} (sf) had been {{published}} before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. After 1931, when Miracle Science and Fantasy Stories was launched, no new sf magazines appeared for several years. In 1936 Abraham and Martin Goodman, two brothers who owned a publishing company with multiple imprints, launched Ka-Zar, an imitation Tarzan magazine with some borderline sf content. It lasted for three issues, with the last issue dated January 1937. In addition to this marginal sf magazine, in 1937 the Goodmans began publishing several [...] "weird-menace" [...] pulps. These were a genre of pulp magazine known for incorporating [...] "sex and sadism", with storylines that placed women in danger, usually because of a threat {{that appeared to be}} supernatural but was ultimately revealed to be the work of a human villain. The Goodmans' titles were Detective Short Stories, launched in August 1937, and Mystery Tales, which published its first issue in March 1938. These were followed up by Marvel Science Stories, edited by Robert O. Erisman, which was not intended to be a weird-menace pulp, but rather an sf magazine. The influence of the [...] "sex and sadism" [...] side of the Goodman's portfolio of magazines was apparent, however: authors were sometimes asked to add more sex to their stories than was usual in sf at the time. This {{was the first time that}} the word [...] "Marvel" [...] was used in the title of a Goodman publication. It went on to be used in other titles, notably Marvel Comics in the following year. The word may have been chosen to appeal <b>to</b> <b>advertisers</b> Marvel Home Utilities and Marvel Mystery Oil, or it may have been that Martin Goodman liked the name because it was similar to his own.|$|E
