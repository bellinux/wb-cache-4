5|$|Du Bois {{used his}} {{influential}} {{role in the}} NAACP to oppose a variety of racist incidents. When the silent film The Birth of a Nation premiered in 1915, Du Bois and the NAACP led the fight <b>to</b> <b>ban</b> <b>the</b> movie, because of its racist portrayal of blacks as brutish and lustful. The fight was not successful, and possibly contributed to the film's fame, but the publicity drew many new supporters to the NAACP.|$|E

5|$|In mid-2001, Universal Music Group {{was criticized}} for airing {{commercials}} promoting the album during episodes of Total Request Live. Manson suspected that former Democratic vice-presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman {{played a role in}} the criticism. Lieberman and Hillary Clinton had recently introduced the Media Marketing Accountability Act before the United States Congress. This legislation proposed <b>to</b> <b>ban</b> <b>the</b> entertainment-industry from marketing suspected violent or explicit material to minors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1983, Virginia Tech was placed on {{probation}} by the NCAA for violations stemming from illegal benefits given to players and potential recruits. The probation's main effect was <b>to</b> <b>ban</b> <b>the</b> players who received the benefits from participating in any postseason game following the 1984 season. Seven of the eight players involved in the scandal either left Virginia Tech or had the probation lifted {{as a result of}} appeals to the NCAA. The eighth, Bruce Smith, did not.|$|E
5|$|Purchasing {{the section}} allowed Gardiner {{to fix the}} {{drainage}} problems that had deteriorated {{the surface of the}} trail, and <b>to</b> <b>ban</b> <b>the</b> use of motor vehicles, something the Wallkill Valley Land Trust had not done. Though the section was worth $307,300, the Wallkill Valley Land Trust sold it to Gardiner for $70,000.|$|E

5|$|The 1976 All Blacks tour of {{apartheid}} South Africa generated much controversy {{and led to}} the boycott of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal by 33 African nations after the IOC refused <b>to</b> <b>ban</b> <b>the</b> team. New Zealand again failed to win the test series in South Africa: they did not do so until 1996, after the fall {{of apartheid}}. The 1976 tour contributed to the Gleneagles Agreement being adopted by the Commonwealth Heads of State in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Both parties {{reached a}} {{settlement}} on 20 April 2007, agreeing {{to drop their}} respective lawsuits. Under {{the terms of the}} settlement, Thompson has been barred from suing <b>to</b> <b>ban</b> <b>the</b> sale or distribution of games by Take-Two or its subsidiaries. He is restricted to communicating through Take-Two's attorneys on any future matter, but is able to maintain his outspoken stance against their titles and may act as counsel in lawsuits against Take-Two by other parties. For their part, Take-Two agreed to drop the contempt of court lawsuit against Thompson regarding alleged improper conduct during the court hearings for Rockstar's game Bully in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Côte d'Ivoire so that {{he could}} organise {{opposition}} to the Sankara regime. In 1987, Sankara was overthrown and assassinated in a coup. The coup may have had French involvement, since the Sankara regime had fallen into disfavour in France. Houphouët-Boigny was also suspected of involvement in the coup and in November, the PDCI asked the government <b>to</b> <b>ban</b> <b>the</b> sale of Jeune Afrique following its allegations of Houphouët-Boigny's participation. The Ivorian president would have greatly benefited from the divisions in the Burkina Faso government. He contacted Blaise Compaoré, the second-most powerful man in the regime; it is generally believed that they worked in conjunction with Laurent Dona Fologo, Robert Guéï and Pierre Ouédraogo to overthrow the Sankara regime.|$|E

50|$|U Aung San had objected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ban</b> on <b>the</b> Communist Party (Burma), and {{ensured that}} <b>the</b> <b>ban</b> on <b>the</b> party was lifted {{temporarily}} in October 1946.

5|$|Feedback editors John Hoyland and Mike Holderness {{subsequently}} {{adopted the}} term nominative determinism {{as suggested by}} reader C. R. Cavonius. The term {{first appeared in the}} 17 December issue. Even though the magazine tried <b>to</b> <b>ban</b> <b>the</b> topic numerous times over the decades since, readers kept sending in curious examples. These included the U.S. Navy spokesman put up to answer journalists' questions about the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, one Lieutenant Mike Kafka; authors of the book The Imperial Animal Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox; and the UK Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on knife crime, Alfred Hitchcock.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 Pistorius {{applied to}} run in non-disabled track meets. He was at first accepted, but {{questions}} quickly arose about whether the blades give him an unfair advantage. After initial research showed the blades did provide an advantage, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) changed their rules <b>to</b> <b>ban</b> <b>the</b> use of technical devices that provide an advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue {{to run in}} non-disabled meets {{as long as he}} uses the equipment that was studied in the research.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration noted {{the drug was}} being used recreationally in California. It also {{reported}} that BZP was being used as an adulterant in illicit drugs. Not long after, {{there was an explosion}} in the drug's use worldwide – a situation which was soon followed by legislative control in many countries. Since 1999, benzylpiperazine use grew sharply in New Zealand due to an initial complete lack of regulation. The New Zealand government attempted <b>to</b> <b>ban</b> <b>the</b> product as of 18 December 2007, but the necessary second reading of the bill did not happen in time for the law to be passed. It was so widely used that an estimated 5 million pills were sold in New Zealand in 2007.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs {{to improve their}} {{athletic}} abilities. For example, in 1904, Thomas Hicks, a gold medallist in the marathon, was given strychnine by his coach. The only Olympic death linked to performance enhancing occurred at the 1960 Rome games. A Danish cyclist, Knud Enemark Jensen, fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry {{found that he was}} under the influence of amphetamines. By the mid-1960s, sports federations started <b>to</b> <b>ban</b> <b>the</b> use of performance-enhancing drugs; in 1967 the IOC followed suit.|$|E
5|$|No formal {{coursing}} {{has taken}} place in Northern Ireland since 2002, as Ministers have refused the coursing clubs permission to net hares, and have protected them from being coursed or hunted under the Game Preservation (Northern Ireland) Act and in June 2010 the Northern Ireland Assembly voted <b>to</b> <b>ban</b> <b>the</b> practice. The two extant Northern Ireland coursing clubs since 2002 have travelled to the Republic to hold meetings jointly with coursing clubs there. Opinion polls commissioned by the League Against Cruel Sports as part of its campaigning have shown very strong public opposition to hare coursing from both urban and rural residents of Northern Ireland (and the Republic of Ireland).|$|E
5|$|Goosebumps {{was listed}} 15th {{in the list}} of most {{frequently}} challenged books during 1990–1999 and 94th {{in the list of}} top banned/challenged books during 2000–2009 by the American Library Association (ALA). According to the ALA, a challenge is an attempt by a person or group to remove or restrict materials from a library or school curriculum. The series was challenged for being too frightening for young people and depicting occult or demonic themes. By 1997, the ALA was informed of 46 challenges, over 75% of which occurred in school libraries. The rest of the challenges were held in public libraries or the location of the challenges were unknown. The same year, a hearing by the Anoka-Hennepin School District <b>to</b> <b>ban</b> <b>the</b> books was broadcast by C-SPAN. In the hearing, most of the parents and children felt the books should not be banned, and the school district's book review committee decided to keep the books.|$|E

5|$|In September 1951, Oliphant {{applied for}} a visa {{to travel to the}} United States for a nuclear physics conference in Chicago. The visa was not refused, nor was Oliphant accused of subversive activities, but neither was it issued. This was the height of the Red Scare. The American McCarran Act {{restricted}} travel to the United States, and in Australia the Menzies government was attempting <b>to</b> <b>ban</b> <b>the</b> Communist Party, and was not inclined to support Oliphant against the American government. A subsequent request to travel to Canada via Hawaii in September 1954 was refused by the United States Department of State. Although Oliphant was granted a special waiver that allowed him to transit the US, he preferred to cancel the trip rather than accept this humiliation. The Menzies government subsequently excluded him from participating in or observing the British nuclear tests at Maralinga, nor was he allowed access to classified nuclear information for fear of antagonising the US.|$|E
5|$|Marshall's {{opponent}} {{in the general election}} was Republican Congressman James E. Watson, and the campaign focused on temperance and prohibition. Just as it began, the Republican-controlled state government passed a local-option law that allowed counties <b>to</b> <b>ban</b> <b>the</b> sale of liquor. The law became the central point of debate between the parties and their gubernatorial candidates. The Democrats proposed that the local-option law be changed so that the decision to ban liquor sales could be made at the city and township level. This drew support from anti-prohibitionists, who saw it as an opportunity to roll back prohibition in some areas, and as the only alternative available to the total prohibition which the Republican Party advocated. The Democratic position also helped to retain prohibitionists' support by allowing prohibition to remain enacted in communities where a majority supported it. The Republican Party {{was in the midst of}} a period of instability, splitting along progressive and conservative lines. Their internal problems proved to be the deciding factor in the election, giving Marshall a narrow victory: he received 48.1 percent of the vote to Watson's 48 percent. He was the first Democratic governor in two decades. Democrats also came to power in the Indiana House of Representatives by a small margin, though Republicans retained control of the Indiana Senate.|$|E
5|$|Real Madrid's {{hardcore}} {{supporters are}} the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They {{are known for}} their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so. Florentino Pérez took it upon himself <b>to</b> <b>ban</b> <b>the</b> Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result. The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.|$|E
