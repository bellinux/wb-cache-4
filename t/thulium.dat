5|$|Soluble <b>thulium</b> salts are mildly toxic, but {{insoluble}} <b>thulium</b> salts {{are completely}} nontoxic. When injected, <b>thulium</b> can cause degeneration {{of the liver}} and spleen and can also cause hemoglobin concentration to fluctuate. Liver damage from <b>thulium</b> is more prevalent in male mice than female mice. Despite this, <b>thulium</b> has {{a low level of}} toxicity. In humans, <b>thulium</b> occurs in the highest amounts in the liver, kidneys and bones. Humans typically consume several micrograms of <b>thulium</b> per year. The roots of plants do not take up <b>thulium,</b> and the dry weight of vegetables usually contains one part per billion of <b>thulium.</b> <b>Thulium</b> dust and powder are toxic upon inhalation or ingestion and can cause explosions. Radioactive <b>thulium</b> isotopes can cause radiation poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The {{element is}} never {{found in nature}} in pure form, but it is found in small {{quantities}} in minerals with other rare earths. <b>Thulium</b> is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium. In particular, <b>thulium</b> occurs in the mineral gadolinite. However, <b>thulium</b> also occurs in the minerals monazite, xenotime, and euxenite. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is 0.5mg/kg by weight and 50 parts per billion by moles. <b>Thulium</b> makes up approximately 0.5 parts per million of soil, although this value can range from 0.4 to 0.8 parts per million. <b>Thulium</b> makes up 250 parts per quadrillion of seawater. In the solar system, <b>thulium</b> exists in concentrations of 200 parts per trillion by weight and 1part per trillion by moles. <b>Thulium</b> ore occurs most commonly in China. However, Australia, Brazil, Greenland, India, Tanzania, and the United States also have large reserves of <b>thulium.</b> Total reserves of <b>thulium</b> are approximately 100,000 tonnes. <b>Thulium</b> is the least abundant lanthanide on earth except for promethium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thulium</b> is principally {{extracted}} from monazite ores (~0.007% <b>thulium)</b> found in river sands, through ion-exchange. Newer ion-exchange and solvent-extraction techniques {{have led to}} easier separation of the rare earths, which has yielded much lower costs for <b>thulium</b> production. The principal sources today are the ion adsorption clays of southern China. In these, where {{about two-thirds of the}} total rare-earth content is yttrium, <b>thulium</b> is about 0.5% (or about tied with lutetium for rarity). The metal can be isolated through reduction of its oxide with lanthanum metal or by calcium reduction in a closed container. None of thulium's natural compounds are commercially important. Approximately 50 tonnes per year of <b>thulium</b> oxide are produced. In 1996, <b>thulium</b> oxide cost US$20 per gram, and in 2005, 99%-pure <b>thulium</b> metal powder cost US$70 per gram.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thulium</b> {{reacts with}} {{hydrogen}} chloride to produce hydrogen gas and <b>thulium</b> chloride. With nitric acid it yields <b>thulium</b> nitrate, or Tm(NO3)3.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thulium</b> {{reacts with}} various {{metallic}} and non-metallic elements forming {{a range of}} binary compounds, including TmN, TmS, TmC2, Tm2C3, TmH2, TmH3, TmSi2, TmGe3, TmB4, TmB6 and TmB12. In those compounds, <b>thulium</b> exhibits valence states +2 and +3, however, the +3 state is most common and only this state has been observed in <b>thulium</b> solutions. <b>Thulium</b> exists as a Tm3+ ion in solution. In this state, the <b>thulium</b> ion is surrounded by nine molecules of water. Tm3+ ions exhibit a bright blue luminescence.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, the Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve {{separated}} from the rare earth oxide erbia another two previously unknown components, which he called holmia and thulia; these were the oxides of holmium and <b>thulium,</b> respectively. A relatively pure sample of <b>thulium</b> metal was first obtained in 1911.|$|E
5|$|Pure <b>thulium</b> metal has a bright, silvery luster, which tarnishes on {{exposure}} to air. The metal {{can be cut}} with a knife, as it has a Mohs hardness of 2 to 3; it is malleable and ductile. <b>Thulium</b> is ferromagnetic below 32K, antiferromagnetic between 32 and 56K, and paramagnetic above 56K.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thulium</b> has {{two major}} allotropes: the tetragonal α-Tm {{and the more}} stable {{hexagonal}} β-Tm.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thulium</b> is the second-least {{abundant}} of the lanthanides after promethium, {{which is}} only found in trace quantities on Earth. It is an easily workable metal with a bright silvery-gray luster. It is fairly soft and slowly tarnishes in air. Despite its high price and rarity, <b>thulium</b> is used as the radiation source in portable X-ray devices, and in some solid-state lasers. It has no significant biological role and is not particularly toxic.|$|E
5|$|Thulium-169 is thulium's longest-lived {{and most}} {{abundant}} isotope. It {{is the only}} isotope of <b>thulium</b> that {{is thought to be}} stable, although it is predicted to undergo alpha decay to holmium-165 with a very long half-life. After thulium-169, the next-longest-lived isotopes are thulium-171, which has a half-life of 1.92 years, and thulium-170, which has a half-life of 128.6 days. Most other isotopes have half-lives of a few minutes or less. Thirty-five isotopes and 26 nuclear isomers of <b>thulium</b> have been detected. Most isotopes of <b>thulium</b> lighter than 169 atomic mass units decay via electron capture or beta-plus decay, although some exhibit significant alpha decay or proton emission. Heavier isotopes undergo beta-minus decay.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thulium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Tm and atomic number 69. It is the thirteenth and third-last {{element in the}} lanthanide series. Like the other lanthanides, the most common oxidation state is +3, seen in its oxide, halides and other compounds; because it occurs so late in the series, however, the +2 oxidation state is also stabilized by the nearly full 4f shell that results. In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble <b>thulium</b> compounds form coordination complexes with nine water molecules.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, mendelevium is located {{to the right}} of the actinide fermium, to the left of the actinide nobelium, and below the lanthanide <b>thulium.</b> Mendelevium metal has not yet been prepared in bulk quantities, and bulk preparation is currently impossible. Nevertheless, a number of predictions and some preliminary experimental results have been done regarding its properties.|$|E
5|$|The {{isotopes}} of <b>thulium</b> {{range from}} 145Tm to 179Tm. The primary decay mode before {{the most abundant}} stable isotope, 169Tm, is electron capture, and the primary mode after is beta emission. The primary decay products before 169Tm are element 68 (erbium) isotopes, and the primary products after are element 70 (ytterbium) isotopes.|$|E
5|$|As an even-numbered lanthanide, in {{accordance}} with the Oddo-Harkins rule, ytterbium is significantly more abundant than its immediate neighbors, <b>thulium</b> and lutetium, which occur in the same concentrate at levels of about 0.5% each. The world production of ytterbium is only about 50 tonnes per year, reflecting that it has few commercial applications. Microscopic traces of ytterbium are used as a dopant in the , a solid-state laser in which ytterbium is the element that undergoes stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its high}} cost, {{portable}} X-ray devices use <b>thulium</b> {{that has been}} bombarded in a nuclear reactor as a radiation source. These sources have a useful life of about one year, as tools in medical and dental diagnosis, {{as well as to}} detect defects in inaccessible mechanical and electronic components. Such sources do not need extensive radiation protection – only a small cup of lead.|$|E
5|$|High-purity <b>thulium</b> oxide {{was first}} offered commercially {{in the late}} 1950s, {{as a result of}} the {{adoption}} of ion-exchange separation technology. Lindsay Chemical Division of American Potash & Chemical Corporation offered it in grades of 99% and 99.9% purity. The price per kilogram has oscillated between US$4,600 and $13,300 in the period from 1959 to 1998 for 99.9% purity, and it was second highest for lanthanides behind lutetium.|$|E
5|$|Holmium-chromium-thulium triple-doped Yttrium {{aluminum}} garnet (Ho:Cr:Tm:YAG, or Ho,Cr,Tm:YAG) is {{an active}} laser medium material with high efficiency. It lases at 2097nm and is widely used in military applications, medicine, and meteorology. Single-element thulium-doped YAG (Tm:YAG) lasers operate between 1930 and 2040nm. The wavelength of thulium-based lasers is very efficient for superficial ablation of tissue, with minimal coagulation depth in air or in water. This makes <b>thulium</b> lasers attractive for laser-based surgery.|$|E
5|$|The {{isotopes}} of ytterbium {{range in}} atomic weight from 147.9674 {{atomic mass unit}} (u) for 148Yb to 180.9562u for 181Yb. The primary decay mode of ytterbium isotopes lighter than the most abundant stable isotope, 174Yb, is electron capture, and the primary decay mode for those heavier than 174Yb is beta decay. The primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes lighter than 174Yb are <b>thulium</b> isotopes, and the primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes with heavier than 174Yb are lutetium isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Although usually trivalent, {{ytterbium}} readily forms divalent compounds. This {{behavior is}} unusual for lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 {{state has a}} valence electron configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion {{is a very strong}} reducing agent and decomposes water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in aqueous solution. Samarium and <b>thulium</b> also behave this way in the +2 state, but europium(II) is stable in aqueous solution. Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} {{behavior of}} ytterbium {{is similar to}} that of the rest of the lanthanides. Most ytterbium compounds are found in the +3 oxidation state, and its salts in this oxidation state are nearly colorless. Like europium, samarium, and <b>thulium,</b> the trihalides of ytterbium can be reduced to the dihalides by hydrogen, zinc dust, or by the addition of metallic ytterbium. The +2 oxidation state occurs only in solid compounds and reacts in some ways similarly to the alkaline earth metal compounds; for example, ytterbium(II) oxide (YbO) shows the same structure as calcium oxide (CaO).|$|E
5|$|In the universe, thorium {{is among}} the rarest of the {{primordial}} elements, because {{it is one of}} the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process, and also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed. The only primordial elements rarer than thorium are uranium, also produced only by the r-process, and <b>thulium,</b> lutetium, tantalum, and rhenium, the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals. Neutron capture by nuclides beyond A = 209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption, reducing the fraction of nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become actinides such as thorium. In the distant past the abundances of thorium and uranium were enriched by the decay of plutonium and curium isotopes, and thorium was enriched relative to uranium by the decay of 236U to 232Th and the natural depletion of 235U, but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute.|$|E
5|$|Some common uses {{of heavy}} metals {{depend on the}} general {{characteristics}} of metals such as electrical conductivity and reflectivity or the general characteristics of heavy metals such as density, strength, and durability. Other uses depend {{on the characteristics of}} the specific element, such as their biological role as nutrients or poisons or some other specific atomic properties. Examples of such atomic properties include: partly filled d- or f- orbitals (in many of the transition, lanthanide, and actinide heavy metals) that enable the formation of coloured compounds; the capacity of most heavy metal ions (such as platinum, cerium or bismuth) to exist in different oxidation states and therefore act as catalysts; poorly overlapping 3d or 4f orbitals (in iron, cobalt, and nickel, or the lanthanide heavy metals from europium through <b>thulium)</b> that give rise to magnetic effects; and high atomic numbers and electron densities that underpin their nuclear science applications. Typical uses of heavy metals can be broadly grouped into the following six categories.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exceptions}} of La, Yb, and Lu (which have no unpaired f electrons), the lanthanides are strongly paramagnetic, {{and this is}} reflected in their magnetic susceptibilities. Gadolinium becomes ferromagnetic at below 16°C (Curie point). The other heavier lanthanides – terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, <b>thulium,</b> and ytterbium – become ferromagnetic at much lower temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the method}} {{developed}} by Carl Gustaf Mosander, Cleve first removed {{all of the}} known contaminants from erbia. The result of that effort was two new materials, one brown and one green. He named the brown substance holmia (after the Latin name for Cleve's home town, Stockholm) and the green one thulia. Holmia was later {{found to be the}} holmium oxide and thulia was <b>thulium</b> oxide.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the time}} that ion-exchange methods and elution were available, the {{separation}} of the rare earths was primarily achieved by repeated precipitation or crystallisation. In those days, the first separation was into two main groups, the cerium-group earths (scandium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, and samarium) and the yttrium-group earths (yttrium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, <b>thulium,</b> ytterbium, and lutetium). Europium, gadolinium, and terbium were either considered as a separate group of rare-earth elements (the terbium group), or europium was included in the cerium group, and gadolinium and terbium were included in the yttrium group. The reason for this division arose from the difference in solubility of rare-earth double sulfates with sodium and potassium. The sodium double sulfates of the cerium group are difficultly soluble, those of the terbium group slightly, and those of the yttrium group are very soluble. Sometimes, the yttrium group was further split into the erbium group (dysprosium, holmium, erbium, and <b>thulium)</b> and the ytterbium group (ytterbium and lutetium), but today the main grouping is between the cerium and the yttrium groups.|$|E
25|$|Discoverers of some {{elements}} named them after {{their home country}} or city. Marie Curie named polonium after Poland; ruthenium, gallium, germanium, and lutetium {{were based on the}} Latin names for Russia, France, Germany, and Paris. Other elements are named after the place where they were discovered. Four elements, terbium, erbium, ytterbium, and yttrium were named after a Swedish village Ytterby, where ores containing them were extracted. Other elements named after places are magnesium (after Magnesia), strontium, scandium, europium, <b>thulium</b> (after an old Roman name for the far north of Scandinavia), holmium, copper (derived from Cyprus, where it was mined in the Roman era), hafnium, rhenium, americium, berkelium, californium, and darmstadtium.|$|E
25|$|BOLD {{contrast}} {{depends on}} blood flow, {{which is both}} slowly changing and subject to noisy influences. Other biomarkers now looked at to provide better contrast include temperature, acidity/alkalinity (pH), calcium-sensitive agents, neuronal magnetic field, and the Lorentz effect. Temperature contrast depends on changes in brain temperature from its activity. The initial burning of glucose raises the temperature, and the subsequent inflow of fresh, cold blood lowers it. These changes alter the magnetic properties of tissue. Since the internal contrast is too difficult to measure, external agents such <b>thulium</b> compounds are used to enhance the effect. Contrast based on pH depends on changes in the acid/alkaline balance of brain cells when they go active. This too often uses an external agent. Calcium-sensitive agents make MRI more sensitive to calcium concentrations, with calcium ions often being the messengers for cellular signalling pathways in active neurons. Neuronal magnetic field contrast measures the magnetic and electric changes from neuronal firing directly. Lorentz-effect imaging tries to measure the physical displacement of active neurons carrying an electric current within the strong static field.|$|E
500|$|<b>Thulium</b> {{is quite}} {{electropositive}} and reacts slowly {{with cold water}} and quite quickly with hot water to form <b>thulium</b> hydroxide: ...|$|E
500|$|Thulium's {{only known}} oxide is Tm2O3. This oxide is {{sometimes}} called [...] "thulia". Reddish-purple thulium(II) compounds {{can be made by}} the reduction of thulium(III) compounds. Examples of thulium(II) compounds include the halides (except the fluoride). Some hydrated <b>thulium</b> compounds, such as TmCl3·7H2O and Tm2(C2O4)3·6H2O are green or greenish-white. <b>Thulium</b> dichloride reacts very vigorously with water. This reaction results in hydrogen gas and Tm(OH)3 exhibiting a fading reddish color. Combination of <b>thulium</b> and chalcogens results in <b>thulium</b> chalcogenides.|$|E
500|$|<b>Thulium</b> {{has been}} used in {{high-temperature}} superconductors similarly to yttrium. <b>Thulium</b> potentially has use in ferrites, ceramic magnetic materials that are used in microwave equipment. <b>Thulium</b> is also similar to scandium in that it is used in arc lighting for its unusual spectrum, in this case, its green emission lines, which are not covered by other elements. Because <b>thulium</b> fluoresces with a blue color when exposed to ultraviolet light, <b>thulium</b> is put into euro banknotes as a measure against counterfeiting. The blue fluorescence of Tm-doped calcium sulfate {{has been used}} in personal dosimeters for visual monitoring of radiation. Tm-doped halides which Tm is in its 2+ valence state, are promising luminescent materials that can make efficient electricity generating windows based on the principle of a luminescent solar concentrator, possible [...]|$|E
500|$|<b>Thulium</b> tarnishes {{slowly in}} air and burns readily at 150°C to form thulium(III) oxide: ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Thulium</b> {{reacts with}} all the halogens. Reactions are slow at room temperature, but are {{vigorous}} above 200°C: ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Thulium</b> dissolves readily in dilute {{sulfuric acid}} to form {{solutions}} containing the pale green [...] Tm(III) ions, which exist as 3+ complexes: ...|$|E
500|$|Contrary to {{most other}} lanthanides, {{which have a}} {{close-packed}} hexagonal lattice, ytterbium crystallizes in the face-centered cubic system. Ytterbium has a density of 6.973g/cm3, which is significantly {{lower than those of}} the neighboring lanthanides, <b>thulium</b> (9.32g/cm3) and lutetium (9.841g/cm3). Its melting and boiling points are also significantly lower than those of <b>thulium</b> and lutetium. This is due to the closed-shell electron configuration of ytterbium ( [...] 4f14 6s2), which causes only the two 6s electrons to be available for metallic bonding (in contrast to the other lanthanides where three electrons are available) and increases ytterbium's metallic radius.|$|E
500|$|<b>Thulium</b> was so {{rare that}} none of the early workers had enough of it to purify {{sufficiently}} to actually see the green color; they had to be content with spectroscopically observing the strengthening of the two characteristic absorption bands, as erbium was progressively removed. [...] The first researcher to obtain nearly pure <b>thulium</b> was Charles James, a British expatriate working on a large scale at New Hampshire College in Durham. In 1911 he reported his results, having used his discovered method of bromate fractional crystallization to do the purification. [...] He famously needed 15,000 purification operations to establish that the material was homogeneous.|$|E
500|$|<b>Thulium</b> was {{discovered}} by Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve in 1879 by looking for impurities in the oxides of other rare earth elements (this was the same method Carl Gustaf Mosander earlier used to discover some other rare earth elements). Cleve started by removing all of the known contaminants of erbia (Er2O3). [...] Upon additional processing, he obtained two new substances; one brown and one green. The brown substance was the oxide of the element holmium and was named holmia by Cleve, and the green substance was the oxide of an unknown element. Cleve named the oxide thulia and its element <b>thulium</b> after Thule, an Ancient Greek place name associated with Scandinavia or Iceland. Thulium's atomic symbol was once Tu, but this was changed to Tm.|$|E
