It was like lots of kibitzing and playing, and throwing stuff at each other, and making jokes. We actually recorded the (instrumental) track and the vocals pretty much live at the same <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> do have footage of it, but it's never been shown."

500|$|Despite the Rolling Stones' {{predilection for}} blues and R numbers on their early live set lists, the first {{original}} compositions by the band reflected a more wide-ranging interest. The first Jagger/Richards single, [...] "Tell Me (You're Coming Back)", {{has been described}} by critic Richie Unterberger as a [...] "pop rock ballad... When [...] began to write songs, they were usually not derived from the blues, but were often surprisingly fey, slow, Mersey-type pop numbers". [...] "As Tears Go By", the ballad originally written for Marianne Faithfull, {{was one of the first}} songs written by Jagger and Richards and also one of many written by the duo for other artists. Jagger said of the song, [...] "It's a relatively mature song considering the rest of the output at the <b>time.</b> <b>And</b> <b>we</b> didn't think of [...] it, because the Rolling Stones were a butch blues group." [...] The Rolling Stones did later record a version which became a top five hit in the US.|$|E
500|$|Gasaway {{disagreed}} {{that the}} Whigs deceived the voters, [...] "The 'fable' of 1840 {{tells us that}} the Whigs triumphed over baffled and listless Democrats by convincing voters that Harrison lived in a log cabin and that he was a great war hero when, so the legend goes, neither claim was true. [...] Whigs did not say that Harrison lived in a log cabin and in fact went into great detail describing his actual house. The 'log cabin' was much more symbol than claim." [...] Gasaway suggested that the 1840 campaign gained a poor reputation because Harrison and the Whig Party soon vanished from the scene, and many of those who had supported both in 1840 saw the election as a squandered opportunity: [...] "Add to this the fact that the poor man died only thirty days into an administration launched by what was perhaps the most exciting election campaign in the nation's history up to that <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> are confronted... with an undeniable and almost irresistible touch of opera bouffé." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{synchronize}} the samples, The Bomb Squad used SMPTE timecodes and arranged and overdubbed particular bits of backing tracks, {{which had been}} inspected by the members for snare, bass, and hi-hat sounds. Chuck D said of their production and sampling, [...] "Our music is all about samples in the right area, layers that pile on each other. We put loops on top of loops on top of loops, but then in the mix we cut things away". Their production was innovative, according to journalist Jeff Chang. [...] "They're {{figuring out how to}} jam with the samples and to create these layers of sound", Chang said. [...] "I don't think it’s been matched since then." [...] After the tracks were completed, The Bomb Squad began sequencing what was at first a seemingly discontinuous album, amid internal disputes among its members. The final mixing took place at Greene St. Recording and lasted until February 1990. According to Sadler, [...] "a lot of people were like, 'Wow, it's a brilliant album'.

500|$|Johnson gained {{high office}} {{due to his}} proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and {{self-employed}} tradesmen who made up much of Tennessee's electorate. He called them the [...] "plebeians"; he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state Democratic Party, but none could match him as a vote-getter. After his death, one Tennessee voter wrote of him, [...] "Johnson {{was always the same}} to everyone... the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen." [...] Always seen in impeccably tailored clothing, he cut an impressive figure, and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate. Mostly denied the party's machinery, he relied on a network of friends, advisers, and contacts. One friend, Hugh Douglas, stated in a letter to him, [...] "you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time.

500|$|Despite some {{moderate}} critical praise {{including a}} glowing review from AllMusic, {{who called the}} album's [...] "impressively surprising" [...] array of sounds [...] "refreshing coming from a band who {{was assumed to be}} generic retro swing", Soul Caddy failed to achieve the chart success or commercial attention of its predecessor. The Daddies' accompanying national tour fared just as poorly, showing a marked decline in attendance and negative audience reactions towards the band's decreased focus on playing swing music. Speaking retrospectively in a 2002 interview, Perry recalled [...] "we went out on tour and most people saw us as a swing band because of the success of Zoot Suit Riot...we felt this tension to be something we weren't". Facing low ticket sales and their own dissatisfaction over the tour's outcome, the Daddies brought their scheduled tour to an early close, eventually reaching a mutual decision upon taking an indefinite hiatus in December 2000. [...] "A lot of it was just fatigue", Perry explained, [...] "We'd be on the road for a long <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> had no life outside of Cherry Poppin' Daddies. [...] I think everybody was interested in doing other things". The Daddies were released from Mojo shortly thereafter, though Jason Moss would later comment that the band were kicked [...] "to the curb" [...] after Soul Caddys poor commercial performance.|$|E
500|$|During the U.S. third leg, it was {{reported}} that Born to Run would be featured in its entirety during several shows, possibly in a scheme to boost ticket sales. [...] The full-album idea took fruition with the late September-early October set of five shows at Giants Stadium, which would be the final concerts ever in that venue in Springsteen's home state. [...] Born to Run was played at two shows, Darkness on the Edge of Town at one show, and Born in the U.S.A. at two shows. [...] Springsteen later said of the full album idea, [...] "We had done so many shows and were going to come back around one more time, so we were like, 'OK, what can we do that we haven't done? Let's try to play some of the albums.' There were some people who were starting to do it, it sounded like a good idea, and my audience fundamentally experienced all my music in album form. People took Born to Run home and played it start to finish 100 times; they didn't slip on a cut in the middle. And we made albums – we took a long <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> built them to last. ... Those records are packed with songs that have lasted 30–35 years.

500|$|Although some {{survivors}} {{disputed the}} accounts of cannibalism, Charles McGlashan, who corresponded {{with many of the}} survivors over a 40-year period, documented many recollections that it occurred. Some correspondents were not forthcoming, approaching their participation with shame, but others eventually spoke about it freely. McGlashan in his 1879 book History of the Donner Party declined to include some of the more morbid detailssuch as the suffering of the children and infants before death, or how Mrs. Murphy, according to Georgia Donner, gave up, lay down on her bed and faced the wall when the last of the children left in the third relief. He also neglected to mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek. The same year McGlashan's book was published, Georgia Donner wrote to him to clarify some points, saying that human flesh was prepared for people in both tents at Alder Creek, but to her recollection (she was four years old during the winter of 1846–1847) it was given only to the youngest children: [...] "Father was crying and did not look at us the entire <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> little ones felt we could not help it. There was nothing else." [...] She also remembered that Elizabeth Donner, Jacob's wife, announced one morning that she had cooked the arm of Samuel Shoemaker, a 25-year-old teamster. Eliza Donner Houghton, in her 1911 account of the ordeal, did not mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek.|$|E
