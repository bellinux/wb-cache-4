50|$|Cuffe reached Freetown, Sierra Leone on March 1, 1811. He {{traveled}} the area investigating {{the social and}} economic conditions of the region. He met with some of the colony’s officials, who opposed his idea for colonization of Blacks from the United States for fear of competition from American merchants. Furthermore, his attempts to sell goods yielded poor results because of tariff charges resulting from the British mercantile system. On Sunday, April 7, 1811 Cuffe met with the foremost Black entrepreneurs of the colony.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose – To {{improve the}} {{understanding}} of the inter-organizational dynamics of the dyadic relationships between a buyer and provider of logistics services (TPL dyads). Design/methodology/approach – Analyzes the preparation, implementation, and operation of a particular case of third party logistics (TPL) arrangements. Based on a single case study of a dyadic relationship, the paper confronts the static view of the transaction cost approach and the agency theory on “governance structures” and “contracts” by showing how “relationship governance” emerges and develops over time. Findings – TPL dyads are subject to both controllable and non-controllable forces of change, which may not always {{have a positive effect on}} the logistics performance or the relationship itself. Inter-organizational dynamics not only relate to learning, competence development, or adaptation, as suggested by other studies, but also to how the dyadic relationships are governed. As the dyad accumulates experience over time, changes will occur in the balance between the two parties in terms of goal congruence and risk preferences, which has a strong influence on the nature of contracts and other safeguards governing the relationship. Similarly, explanatory power of theories applicable to inter-organizational settings may vary as relationships emerge and develop over time. Focus on core competencies as the logic of outsourcing is followed by a period characterized by a principal-agent relationship. <b>To</b> ensure <b>further</b> <b>prosperity</b> of the relationship, the two companies must direct their efforts towards the logic of the network approach...|$|R

Paul II launched an ambitious construction program, building a new Dormition Cathedral, Metropolitan's Chamber, and an exquisite garden with Moscow's first fountain.

The extension of the Western railway line to Dalby in 1868 led to a boom that only deflated when the line was extended west in 1877. <b>Further</b> <b>prosperity</b> occurred {{as a result of}} the Agricultural Land Purchase Act 1894, which opened up substantial tracts of land previously held by the early pastoralists.

500|$|One of {{the notable}} {{characteristics}} of Deir Ghassaneh was {{the concentration of}} 16 local Muslim shrines or saintly-person tombs (maqam, pl. maqamat) in its vicinity which served as visitation sites for the pre-20th-century Palestinian community.

The Barghouti family served as patrons for the various religious sheikhs who oversaw the shrines. The maqamat were dedicated either to prophets (anbah) recognized by the Qur'an or saintly-persons known as welys, whom locals believed had been [...] "close to God." [...] The veneration of the welys tombs, a common feature in peasant life, did not derive from the orthodox Islam which was practiced more strictly in the urban centers, and was rooted in local pre-Islamic, including Christian, tradition.|$|R
50|$|The modern town of Oban grew {{up around}} the distillery, which was founded there in 1794. The town was raised to a burgh of barony in 1811 by royal charter. Sir Walter Scott visited the area in 1814, {{the year in which}} he {{published}} his poem The Lord of the Isles; interest in the poem brought many new visitors to the town. The town was made a Parliamentary Burgh in 1833. The arrival of the railway - Oban to Callender Railway - opened on 30th Jun 1880 brought <b>further</b> <b>prosperity,</b> revitalising local industry and giving new energy to tourism. Also at this time work on the ill-fated Oban Hydro was commenced but abandoned, and left to fall into disrepair, after 1882 when Dr Orr, the schemes originator, realised he had grossly underestimated its cost. Work on McCaig's Tower, a prominent local landmark, started in 1895. It was paid for by John Stewart McCaig (1824-1902) and was constructed, in hard times, to give work for local stone masons.

50|$|Growth {{returned}} with the soldiers after the war, and the town expanded rapidly {{with the arrival of}} the Kansas Pacific Railway in 1867. Salina incorporated as a city in 1870. The cattle trade arrived in 1872, transforming Salina into a cowtown. The trade brought the city <b>further</b> <b>prosperity,</b> but also a rowdy culture that agitated local residents. The cattle trade relocated westward just two years later. During the 1870s, wheat became the dominant crop in the area, steam-powered flour mills were built, and agriculture became the engine of the local economy. In 1874, Salina resident E. R. Switzer introduced alfalfa to area farmers, and its cultivation spread throughout the state. By 1880, the city was an area industrial center with several mills, a carriage and wagon factory, and a farm implement works. Salina was the location of the first garment factory of jeans maker Lee, which opened in 1889. Over the following decade, three railroads were built through the city. The success of the wholesale and milling industries drove Salina's growth into the early 1900s such that, at one point, it was the third-largest producer in the state and the sixth-largest in the United States.|$|R

Once Persia ousted and replaced their Lydian overlord Croesus, the Ephesians played down his contribution to the Temple's restoration. On the whole, the Persians dealt fairly with Ephesus, but removed some religious artifacts from Artemis' Temple to Sardis and brought Persian priests into her Ephesian cult; this was not forgiven. When Alexander conquered the Persians, his offer to finance the Temple's second rebuilding was politely but firmly refused. Ephesian Artemis lent her city's diplomacy a powerful religious edge.|$|R
